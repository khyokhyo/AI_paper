            "review": "See Cambodia from a wonderful perspective. Even though a friend, with whom we traveled, made the arrangements for this tour, we have been kept in the loop all the way by Loan and the team at Viet Prestige.The boat accommodation was above our expectations! The shower was better than we've had on Seabourn, Silversea or any other ship on which we've traveled.Give me a good shower, and a wonderful bed, thanks. The Mekong Prestige II had both.The food was good, although I believe they should concentrate on the Asian food, which they do extremely well, and reduce the amount of European fare. Most likely their German guests could have coped with more Asian food, too.All the staff were friendly and helpful. Ms Cheak Leng, who looked after our table throughout the whole cruise was delightful. Tina and Phia, the bar men learned our wants on the first day, and did not disappoint when we returned from a hot, dusty, excursion.The only downside that sorely needs improvement is the internet access.The boat uses a 3G dongle on its wifi router to provide internet for the passengers. The unit is in the bar area on the upper deck. The wifi coverage on the top deck is good, but the 3G is patchy at times. There were excuses given for undersea cable cuts giving access problems - but from a screen that popped up once, it seems the most prevalent problem is one of SIM cards running out of charge. <g> Maybe there's a budget of so many GB per day, don't know.Anyway, overall a very good cruise. The cruise director, Gaby, was always fun and accommodating, the guides were knowledgeable - the first one a bit full of himself, I thought, the second one, Pisey, much better.Give them a go, and learn about Cambodia.And, if there's anything you can do to help the people of Cambodia get ahead do so - my suggestion would be to get rid of the corrupt government.<g>"

            "review": "Viet Prestige Travel definitely lived up to its name!. We have travelled a lot but have never booked a tour through an overseas company. I was reassured by the fact that Viet Prestige had Trip Advisor ratings on their website. I was doubly impressed by how Ms Hue Tran handled our booking for Vietnam and Cambodia, including our week long river cruise on the Jahan plus personalized tours in both countries. I had many questions for Ms Hue and she always responded within 24 hours: she also took care of getting the Vietnamese visa approval letter for us. As a further indication of her dedication, she even called us after we arrived in Ho Chi Minh airport to make sure everything was all right, and told us we should email her if we needed assistance during our trip. Ms Hue also made sure that all our guides as well as the staff on the Jahan.were aware that I needed a gluten-free diet. Our guides and drivers were all delightful, friendly and knowledgeable: kudos to guide Khoa and driver An in Ho Chi Minh City and guides Sam, Hean and driver Hak in Siem Reap as they made history come alive. They were all extremely punctual and attentive. Our hotels were Ruby River in Ho Chi Minh and Central Angkor Boutique in Siem Reap: both included a buffet breakfast featuring local and Western cuisine and very friendly staff.  The Mekong river cruise on the Jahan exceeded expectations in every way - a beautiful ship, lovely cabin and what a delight to be part of a small group (just 26 cabins and just 41 people on board during our trip). Some of our fellow passengers also booked through Viet Prestige. Our experience in Vietnam and Cambodia was smiling faces and people eager to help in any way. We were constantly thanked for visiting their countries as they really appreciate the difference that tourist dollars make to their lives. I have no hesitation in recommending Ms Hue and Viet Prestige Travel - well done."

Kudos go to Ms Hoa Pham for coordinating and delivering a well organised tour of Indo China heritage sites in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. We booked a private tour and everything was taken care of and went clockwork...from flights (international and domestic), personal airport pickup/dropoffs, accommodation, meal inclusions, very knowledgeable English speaking tour guides, Halong Bay cruise, Mekong river boat trips in Ho Chi Minh and Luang Prabang as well as Tonle Sap Lake in Siem Reap and , of course, tour of the monuments/heritage sites. All the accommodations were nice, comfortable, and in close to proximity to centres of activity. One particular hotel, La Siesta Hotel & Spa in in the Old Quarter stands out with superb staff and customer service. While we were in Hanoi, she went out of her way to meet with us at the hotel. She was always available and so responsive for any questions we may have. She definitely knows the importance of good customer service. I would not hesitate to recommend Viet Prestige Travel to those planning a private tour."

Extremely pleased to have chosen Viet Prestige Travel for our family trip. This was my first timeexperience where an overseas travel firm did the complete arrangementfor our trip. Now, after our trip, I can gladly say that this was thebest decision we made. The professionalism, transparency, efficiencyand friendliness showed by our travel consultant Ms. Hue from Viet Prestige is truly remarkable. In particular, - Our itinerary planning involved numerous email conversations with Ms. Hue and she was highly flexible and supportive in coming up with a suitable tour plan for us.She was more than willing to help in every possible manner to addressany of our concerns - be it regarding food, locations, costsinvolved, etc. This was really a pleasant experience for us. This alsogave us lot of trust and confidence in the firm.- Ms Hue came and met us in person in the hotel on the day of ourarrival and assured us of the best possible services andpresented us with beautiful souvenirs. In that meeting she noted down our furtherpreferences regarding food choices for lunch and dinner and shemade sure that this is taken care of for the rest of the trip. Even our last minuterequests were accommodated well to provide us great tourexperience.- Members in my family had strict vegetarian food preferences and we were reallyhappy that they even took care of individual specific food preferences,spice tolerance etc well in advance. Our food was arranged inexcellent restaurants which served pretty authentic Indian food.- Our guide Mr. Lam was wonderful. He was very friendly, polite,professional and accommodative. My children also reallyenjoyed his company.- They arranged a fantastic Halong Bay cruise for us with Huong Hai Sealife cruise. Ms. Hue made sure that our strict food preferences were taken care of inside the cruise as well. In the cruise, for the evening, they usually serve dinner which is predominantly sea food. But they had prepared and served a complete vegetarian multi-course dinner just for us. More than happy to recommend Viet Prestige Travel to anyone planning trips to Vietnam and Cambodia."

The sales advisor I was dealing with was called Loan, she was an absolute delight, nothing was too much trouble - she arranged a private tailor made tour for two, she organised everything right from the first moment we set foot on Vietnamese soil until our flight home.She organised:-- The letter of approval for our visa ( free of charge!)- driver to pick us up at the airport and bring us to our hotel- professional guides throughout our 2 week tour- excellent drivers throughout the two weeks- all hotels inc breakfast - two internal flights, even printed off and emailed the tickets to us!- Mekong Delta Cruise - Halong Bay Cruise- lots of excursions- entry into all museums, temples etc- lots lots more besides!Also, she went well beyond the call of duty - kept in touch with us during the tour via our driver or guides telephone so we were not charged for calls on our phones, She also invited us to a wonderful dinner with her colleague Huong on our last night in Hanoi.From beginning to end the whole tour went really smoothly, everything was perfect. If we had tried to do the same tour independently we could not have seen or done one quarter of what we did do, also, there is no way we would have been able to do the same tour for the price they quoted us, it was excellent value for money.When we return to Vietnam we most definitely will be booking with Viet Prestige!!!!A big thanks to Loan and Huong and the management at Viet Prestige!!!"

My wife and I had memorable holiday in Cambodia and Vietnam thanks to the patience and organisational ability of Ms Dinh Thao from Viet Prestige Travel. I would have no hesitation in recommending Dinh to anyone comtemplating a trip to this area. She organised our personal guides to always arrive on time.

            "review": "21 days adventure holiday throughout Vietnam. My girlfriend and I had an absolutely amazing vacation in Vietnam arranged by Viet Prestige Travel and Ms Loan this September. We spent 21 days traveling throughout Vietnam and booked a private trip, arranged entirely for us alone. They arranged personal pick up at the airport, transportation, domestic flights and English speaking guides at all destinations. Everything arranged with precision by the travel agency. The weather was (almost) perfect throughout the trip.We traveled the South. Saigon, the Mekong Delta and took a day trip to the Cu chi tunnels. The North, where we spent a day trekking through the really impressive rainforest, passing many small streams and villages on our way. We were invited in for tea with local families and stayed two nights at a homestay. The jungle trekking was really something. We both highly recommend that if you like trekking. We also went on a 3 day cruise to the Halong bay, saw \"the amazing cave\", went kayaking and just relaxed on deck. The last week we spent in Hoian, which really is a nice calm and relaxing place to visit.Ms Loan arranged everything very smoothly for us. At first we sent her some suggestions and questions of how we could plan our vacation. She was really service minded and helpful. Always a quick response and gave us both lots of good ideas and recommendations of what we could do. We e-mailed back and forth a whole bunch of times before we ended up with what sounded like a perfect trip. Even in Vietnam she was always available for us if we needed anything, making sure we didn't have any problems and that hotels, guides and drivers were to our liking. She even invited us for a dinner in Hanoi. Turns out I am the first Norwegian customer they had and my girlfriend being finish they wanted to learn more about Europe. That was a really nice evening. We had a rather rainy weather forecast for our last part of the trip and Ms Loan gladly helped us rebook both hotels and flights. We were far out in Halong bay when she late in the evening called the crew to reach me, because my phone was dead. Really amazing customer service. We both really appreciate the effort put into making our trip exiting and comfortable. We have absolutely nothing to complain about and we would gladly use this travel agency again. If I were to change anything about the trip today, it would be to make sure there are resting days between travel days, especially when going by car. The best parts of the trip were up north. Jungle trekking, Halong bay and we really enjoyed food tours too. Let the agency pre-order meals for you. We got to taste a lot more than what we would ever get to try if we would order ourselves. I would also recommend spending a bit extra on accommodation. Get a cabin with a balcony in Halong bay, its worth the extra cost :-)"

Our agent helped us to create an itinerary that suited our interests.We visited Saigon and Cu Chi Tunnels, Mekong Delta with the floating market, Hanoi City, did jungle trekking in Mai Chau, went to Halong Bay and finally we had relaxing days in Hoi An. We visited a lot of small villages, rice farms and stayed two nights at a home stay. We had several pre-booked meals that gave us the chance to try very tasty food that we would not have ordered on our own. Ms Loan booked all domestic flights, transportation by car, guides, programs, many meals and hotels with great precision. We are very pleased with the selection of guides and recommendations on activities, we appreciated everything highly.Top three activities on our program according to me was jungle trekking in Mai Chau, 3-day boat cruise in Halong bay and the romantic sunset dinner on the river in Hoi An.Ms Loan was easily available to us throughout the whole journey and really wanted our trip to be as perfect as possible. Due to some bad weather forecasts, we chose two times to make some changes in our itinerary. She listened carefully to our concerns and wishes and rebooked both domestic flights and hotels without any problem so that we could avoid the rain. She was always happy and accommodating and treated us with a customer service we have never before encountered. In Hanoi, we were also invited to a lovely dinner by the travel agency. I can not thank Ms Loan and Prestige Travel enough for our fantastic trip in Vietnam. We would never been able to plan a similar trip on our own without the expertise of this local company. I give my best recommendations!Andrea, Finland"

I visited beautiful Vietnam this year and I bought the tour from Viet Prestige tour company with the help of Ms Giang, who is very helpful and friendly. The tours were very organised and the service was exceptional. Very professional staff and on time! Excellent timing and proactive staff. The driver in Hanoi really helpful and friendly, he spoke good English and communication was easy. The travel consultant Giang was checking up all the time if everything is okay and she made sure that drivers and tour guides come and collect me on time. The tour (14 days) that she proposed was excellent and covered the major cities in Vietnam with very good choice of hotels and daily tours. I had a tour as well to Cambodia with the same company which was excellent as well, the driver (Ly Nam) was really helpful and spoke excellent English. He offered a lot of help and he was very informative about his country. to sum it up, this tour agency made my trip to Vietnam special! Special thanks to Ms Giang who is excellent and very informative. I want to add as well that after the tour, the company gave me a small cute gift which shows the Vietnamese hospitality!! I recommend this company for anyone who wants to have a very organised and friendly tour company."

Luckily, I came across Viet Prestige Travel through an internet search because they made our trip so easy and the outcomes exceeded my expectations in so many surprising ways. First of all, Ms. Hoa Pham was such a pleasure to work with - quick, responsive, and flexible about all of my requests. The hotels were excellent and the meals that were included were also wonderful. I did not have high expectations for the included meals since past experience have generally proven that included meals are just going to be mediocre or overpriced, but Ms. Pham's choices were really excellent. Our tour guides also made our travel so easy and their insight contributed greatly to the richness of our experience. Their itinerary was also a great balance between activities and downtime, which my husband and I especially appreciated with our 5 and 7 year old. Overall, I felt that there services were a great value. I would definitely recommend them and use their services again in the future."

We sourced the travel agent Viet Prestige Tours through some feedback on Trip Advisor.

We spent 17 days in total touring around Cambodia and Vietnam, we had amazing tour guides that were more than happy and courteous, their knowledge of the local areas was outstanding and very informative. My personal favourite was Sam in Siem Reap, he had us worked out from the beginning and easily went with the flow. High light for me are to obvious ones, Angkor Watt temples, Halong Bay Junket, Nha Trang beautiful coast, etc. Especially enjoyed a lovely dinner that we attended with Loan, she invited us to attend with her assistant, fully paid for in a beautiful restaurant in Hanoi, this was a lovely touch and really appreciated by all of us.

As for our tour guide, Ngoc, I think he is the best tour guide I have ever met. He is very knowledgeable and fluent in English. The most of all, he is very polite and caring. He cares about our well-being. When some of my family members fell sick during the trip, he even offered to buy medicines for us.

I have to say I have never experienced such professional and personalised service that my group of 10 just experienced. Our agent Ms Hoa Pham organised our 18 day itinery to perfection, not a single hitch! We visited Saigon and Hoi An, chartered our own timber junk boat (Le Cochinchine) to explore the Mekong Delta for 3 days. Crossed borders to Cambodia, visiting Phnom Penh and Siem Reap and tailoring our own adventurous daily tours consisting of trekking and bicycle riding. We had 3 internal flights, speed boat transfers and our own private coaches to ferry us from airport to hotel with a guide to meet us at each location. The staff employed by this company are second to none, each guide had great personalities and were very passionate about conveying their knowledge of the sights and cultures we were exploring. All of them had a great sense of humour which made the tours with our group so much fun. Our guide in Hoi An even walked us through the que to the checkin counter at Danang airport and requested window seats for our onwards flight. The choices Hoa made for accommodation were faultless and every hotel was awaiting our arrival upon checkin. I would like to thank Hoa and her team for a service provided that I have never experienced before, due to your professionalism each of us has treasured memories of your beautiful country and region and will return again and again. Personally I would like to thank Hoa for helping me organise my group including all flights and visas seamlessly.

I contacted Viet Prestige Travel based on other reviews and could not have been more happy with the prompt, efficient and friendly service received. I had already researched and decided on itinerary and accommodation. Ms Hoa Pham at Viet Prestige co-ordinated my trip, arranged our day tour of Angkor Wat (with an excellent guide), private transfers, booked our Mekong River Cruise on The Jahan (Heritage Line) which was totally sublime, booked internal flight with Vietnam Airlines and a 6 hour private transfer from central coast Vietnam to Hoi An. Nothing too much trouble and at the best price available. I highly recommend this service to other Australian travellers and would definitely use again."

We had the perfect balance of time with a guide and time to explore ourselves. Everywhere we had nice air-conditioned vehicles and a private guide. Vietnam and Cambodia were fascinating -- incredibly interesting culturally and historically. We went to Hanoi, Halong Bay, Siem Reap, and Hoi Ann. The beaches were fantastic too.

I sent an email listing my 3 children's ages (8,10 & 12), the number of days we had to travel, where we wanted to go and budget. Within 24 hours I received a reply with an itinerary and quote. I was excited by the itinerary as it looked kid friendly and included activities I wouldn't have thought of or known to do while there. They had also thought to put a 'break' in the trip to give us much needed downtime! Our travel agent was Ms Hoa Pham and I found her to be accomodating to the frequent changes I made with the people coming on the trip (- the party started at 5 and slowly increased to 9 to include grandparents!) and all communication with her to be prompt and reassuring. When we arrived in Cambodia she called me via the tour guide to welcome us and let us know she was available at any time. She called again via the tour guide when we arrived in Vietnam to see how the holiday was going. The 3* hotels chosen by Ms Hoa were amazing and the 3 tour guides we had were a lot of fun. I was very nervous about booking this kind of holiday, especially with an overseas company. We had never holidayed with a tour guide before but found this to be the best way to see Cambodia and Vietnam. The tour guides were flexible with the itinerary to suit out party of 9 and we had a large comfortable bus to ourselves. We also had 3 internal flights included with local airlines which were faultless. Payment was made with OneWay - a credit card system we hadn't used before but we had nil problems. I would highly recommend this tour company to anyone considering travelling to Cambodia and Vietnam. The only difference I would make to this intinerary is to spend an extra night at each place with a free day to relax, but we couldn't have seen and done everything we did in the 2 weeks if we had those extra days. Thank you again Ms Hoa and I hope we get th opportunity to see more of your beautiful country one day!"

Did lots of shopping in Hoi An and found the best food in Vietnam here. Favourite place.From there fly to HCMC with another tour of tunnels and museum and then to Mekong Delta for a night to see the floating markets.Sunny contacted me numerous times during trip to make sure everything was OK. I contacted him once to check on a flight and his response was immediate.

I\u2019d particularly like to mention Hoa Pham who was so helpful from the first email that passed between us. Our requirements were more than matched \u2013 and in fact, they were surpassed. We thought all of the guides were of the highest calibre, but we were particularly impressed with the services of our driver, Vu and Star (our guide in Hanoi) who was great fun. In Siem Reap, we were a little tired on the last day of our trip so we were very grateful that our guide (Moon) was able to juggle our schedule around. This was representative of the service we received throughout our 18 day trip. We enjoyed both Vietnam and Cambodia, but if we had to choose the place we would like to return to, it would probably be Hanoi and Hoi An. Hoa Pham suggested a 7 day cruise on the Mekong which was unforgettable - we are so glad we agreed to that suggestion as it was interesting, relaxing and very enjoyable.

The rest of it we did at our leisure.Can I say perfect? We are veteran travelers and this was absolutely the best trip we have been on. We had the freedom, yet booked a few thing here and there.

Food on the Mekong Cruise was excellent - good variety. good flavor and friendly service. It was a nice touch that the program organizer included Tuk Tuks, Ox Carts and Rikshaws for transportation on the shore excursions, which really enhanced the rustic Asian experience of this trip.The Halong Bay 3-day 2-night cruise allows you to enjoy the landscape and the serenity at a more relaxed pace than the more often subscribed 2-day 1-night package would. This extra day provides the opportunity for visiting a pearl farm, where I learned the interesting biological aspects of farmed pearl production, and an extended relaxing boat ride rowed by local people. The landscape in Halong Bay was surreal although the hazy weather during our visit created an unfavorable condition for photography.Our 2-day private guided tour to the Cuc Phuong National Park did not turn out too well. The weather was rainy and overcast during our visit. We found it a disappointment after a strenuous 2-hour climbing and hiking only to see an unimpressive \"thousand-year-old tree\". Our program indicated that we were going to have a boat ride passing by the rice fields in Van Long, but our guide recommended to go to Trang An instead due to the driving distance to Van Long. Once we were in Trang An, he changed the plan again due to the long queue waiting for the boat ride. We ended up being taken to a small channel for a boat ride as an expediency. He keeps taking us to local temples as \"time fillers\" despite the fact that we told him that we just visited Angkor Wat in Cambodia and had enough experience with great temples. This guide was the a blemish to our great experience of this Cambodia-Vietnam trip and he knocked my overall rating of 5 down to a 4."

From the moment we set foot in Ho Chi Minh City where our first guide met us to when we departed Hanoi 14 days later we were looked after most brilliantly. Our hotels were lovely, especially the Memoire D'Angkor in Siem Reap, our guides and drivers were totally reliable and informative and all the arrangements worked like clockwork. We could not have been happier. The icing on the cake was to actually meet Hoa and have lunch with her - a real pleasure for both us and our son and daughter-in-law. It was a leap in the dark to work with someone I had never met based in Hanoi to develop our trip. Hoa inspired me and I was confident at all times that I had made the right decision to work with Viet Prestige Travel and this confidence was borne out. Thank you Hoa for everything."

The only bad thing was it went to fast and we hated to come home. It was very relaxing, educational, fun, beautiful scenery. The crew on the ship were really nice. Our tour guides were exceptionally good. Our guide in Seam Reap took us to the old Buddha Temples and to a couple of shops. Our hotel room was really nice. Our Guide in Saigon took us around to a lot of sight seeing places and he was very informative. Our Guide on the boat in Cambodia, he was really good and he gave us a lot of the history of Cambodia. our Vietnam guide was very informative and funny. We enjoyed the entertainment on the ship especially the school kids performing. We took lots of pictures and brought back a lot of good memories. I got sick the last day on the boat. i think it was something I ate or drank out in a village.  The hotel in Saigon was really nice. We ate breakfast and dinner at the hotel restaurant. We met a lot of real nice passengers on the boat. it was fun getting to know people from other countries. Even with my prosthetic, I was able to keep up with everyone. I had no problems. we both did good.We'd like to go back someday. We've told several people about our experiences and how you went out of your way to give us what we wanted. We hope to send some business your way."

We had a tour around Cambodia organised by Ms. Hue Tran and we (my boyfriend and I) found it very convenient and relaxing since all was set, the car and the guide to visit the places always on time and very kind and helpful. The tour included a dinner on a cruise in Phom Penh, a day tour at the Royal Palace, National History Museum, Genocide Museum and Killing fields (very well complete day). Then we travel to Siem Reap by plane and spent 2 days and 3 nights with visits around the main temples (really a must!). Last we went to Sihanoukville and there we had no tour but we took a boat and went to an island nearby which was more beautiful and relaxing than the city. The tour was great but I would recomend to include more time on the beautiful islands which were not include in the trip and are one of the best places in this beautiful land."

Again an amazing experience and we appreciated our local guide's knowledge which also included knowing how to avoid the crowds.Thank you again Hoa, you are so efficient and patient with my decision making. Nothing was too much trouble. I'm sure we will meet again soon as we loved Vietnam and know there is still so much for us to see and do in your lovely and friendly country."

We particularly loved the half day \"cookery\" course in the Water Wheel farm, Hoi An where we did some cooking and so much more!

We had competent drivers in cars that were spotlessly clean, modern, and most important, air conditioned!

We are two agile couples in our mid-sixties and were seeking a personalised \u201csnapshot\u2019 tour of our first visit to Vietnam to optimise the two weeks we had available to travel.Although a little nervous dealing with a travel agency outside Australia, it turned out that there was absolutely no reason for any concern. Everything went like clockwork and we were met at each location (Hanoi, Sapa, Hue/Hoi An and Ho Chi Minh City) by a an English speaking guide, driver and transit van. The cost of our trip included all activities and access to museums, temples, pagodas and other places of interest. Allow a little extra for well deserved tips to the drivers and guides.Accommodation was excellent and generally located in the old quarter of each city/town with immediate access to the vibrant pace of life in Vietnam. Crossing the road is a challenge but drivers/riders are very courteous and providing you don\u2019t break stride you will safely get to the other side.Highlights were in abundance including the vibrancy of Hanoi, the mountain town of Sapa (a must, but do the overnight train one way and pay a bit more to return by road and book a four berth cabin between two for extra space), Halong Bay (one night will do the trick if time is short), the vegetable gardens, cooking school, architecture and food in Hoi An plus Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta."

No wonder she gets so many good mentions on here!Hoa's advice was excellent and she helped us plan our trip down the last detail, always making sure we were happy with it. She was also incredibly patient as we changed our minds a lot. Nothing was too much trouble and she was very responsive! Even though were arranging the trip by email from Australia, we found it really easy to organise with her help. It's clear that she and her organisation really care about the customer and getting it right!The trip itself was 21 days through Vietnam from Hanoi down to Ho Chi Minh and everything in between. We saw some brilliant sights, thanks to Hoa's great advice and diligent organisation. All the accomodation, day tours, guides, included meals etc was planned beautifully. There was only one small glitch with the accomodation one night, but a quick call to Hoa got this sorted out with minimal fuss and inconvenience. Great service!The guides that came with us on the tour were very friendly, helpful and spoke really good english. They were great at looking after us and our young kids (they too, were very patient!). We really enjoyed the trip and we loved Vietnam!Next year, we are planning to do Cambodia & Laos and I will have no hesitation in trusting the planning of that trip to Viet Prestige after the outstanding service they gave us this time! Very impressed and happy."

The guides were very knowledgeable on everything in the area we were traveling in . The trip could not have been organized better in Australia. We were traveling with two 9yr old children ,to have a private guide ,private driver and a private 10 seater van made the holiday so much easier than traveling in a big group . Our guides checked us in at every airport for the next destination. Definitely the way to see these two amazing countries. We will definitely be back and would definitely book with Viet Prestige Travel again. Huge thank you to our tour organizer Hoa Pham. Amazing job . It was lovely to meet her in Hanoi."

From the minute we started dealing with Hoa Pham at Viet Prestige she was nothing but professional and prompt. We booked a three week private tour through to Vietnam and Cambodia. There was two families ( 6 people in total), including two 9 year old kids. The tour was mind blowing, we were greeted at every airport by English speaking guides and drivers, the private vans were in excellent condition. All our guides had fantastic knowledge and were brilliant with our children. Nothing was too much trouble (even organizing laundry and taking us into the airports and checking us in), no one was ever late, there was never any problems our whole trip.It was a trip our children and us will never forget. Hoa from the bottom of my heart thank you for your incredible patients with us trying to fine tune our itinerary, and your phone calls whilst on the tour to ensure that we arrived safely. It truly was a pleasure to meet you. Regards Tina"

Mrs Hoa Pham from Viet Prestige Travel worked really well with me to organise exactly what we wanted and easily accommodated all our requests and changes to the suggested itinery. We were met at every airport and station by a great tour guide, driver and private van. All the hotels were high quality and had either connecting rooms or adjacent rooms for the kids (teenagers). All the hotels also had at least some Western food choices for the husband!!! LOLWe started off in Hanoi, had a city tour and a great lunch there, and then went by sleeper train to Sapa. The Bamboo Hotel in Sapa was excellent- amazing views. We then went to Halong Bay and spent the night on a junk (incredible place) and then flew to Hoi An. We added an extra day here to go in the cable cars up the BaNa mountain. After three nights in Hoi An we flew to Saigon where we had a city tour and spent an excellent day on the Mekong Delta. The lunch that day in a small private house was fantastic. We then went to a beach resort for three free days at Mui Ne. The 5* resort (Mia) was an added change to spoil ourselves and really was luxury all the way - bungalows on the sand with daybeds on the veranda and cocktail bearing waiters whenever we wanted. We flew home from Saigon wishing we could have stayed longer. I did have a few qualms about just picking a tour company from the internet, especially when it came to paying, but I checked out some independent reviews and was also reassured by the payment process being OnePay (Vietnam's BPAY) which is endorsed by all the major credit card companies. The entire tour went as smooth as clockwork and every excursion was well planned and interesting. The whole holiday was arranged in less than a week and only about 3 weeks before we went.I highly recommend Viet Prestige Travel and their excellent tour consultant Mrs Hoa Pham."

She had a great sense of our travel interests after just a few emails and lined up the perfect mix of luxury (ever hotel had great service and amenities) and local experiences (such as a farm visit, bicycling through the countryside). And the local guides at every destination were great as well. In addition to a great itinerary, Viet Prestige was available to help us with any small issues that came up as we traveled. All that and the price was right too. Highly recommend!"

We made a 3 night private cruise on the mekong delta and it was amazing , i could write a book on this trip but will keep it short . from booking this trip months in advance to getting on our boat the customer service was great , our contact Ms Hoa made the pickups and drop offs smooth and answered any questions with a smile . Our private boat looked like something out of a dream , clean beautiful and quite and a joy to sleep on . The boat was staffed by the boat captain , the cook , tour guide and his assistant . the food cooked on the boat was amazing . our tour guide had us wide eyed with his amazing insight into everything we stopped at or asked about . We had stop offs each day , what can be interesting about a brick factory or people making sweets ? listen to your tour guide and enjoy this wonderful culture . We spent hours going along parts of the Mekong delta just sitting with our books closed and what is amazing is the lack of other tourists thanks to the crew and Viet Prestige travel we feel we did something magical . 2 points i would like to raise is the cost , it seems a lot but it is a once in a lifetime experience my second point is its the perfect way to see and understand the workings and beauty of the mekong delta."

Dinh Thao responded very quickly and after many emails and endless questions to poor Dinh our trip was organised. All emails were answered quickly, clearly and efficiently. Our three week trip entailed Cambodia, a seven day cruise down the Mekong River from cambodia to Saigon on The Jahan and then to Saigon, Nha Trang, Hue, Hoi Ann, Hanoi, Two days cruising Halong Bay with Indio China and then back to Hanoi. The mix of hotels was perfect and all the hotels were extremely comfortable fitted with heavenly beds. All guides greeted us on arrival and during our trips nearly drowned us with offers of water. Transport on land was always very comfortable. When we wanted to change our itinerary on two different days Due to being very tired Dinh made all the necessary arrangements.

Part of our trip was cruising up the Mekong on the fabulous RV Jahan.

From the outset, Dinh ensured our every need and question was met. Nothing was to much trouble and she went out of her way to put our minds at ease. Once in Cambodia, we were met by experienced, articulate, interesting and passionate local guides who did what they could to tailor the tours to fit our needs. Everything we did was fascinating, fun and sometimes confronting - which we loved. We learned and experienced so much. Not only did Dinh phone me when we were in Siem Reap to make sure we'd arrived safely, were happy with our accommodation and guide thus far, and again, answer any questions, she took us out for dinner on our arrival in Hanoi. I know of no other agency that offers such a service to customers and takes their duty of care so seriously.

She got us roomy, air-conditioned, adjacent upper-deck cabins on the beautiful Mekong Prestige II; guided us through the payment procedures (accounting for the exchange rates in both US and Canadian dollars); alerted us to changes in flight schedules; and once the trip started, kept in touch with us regularly to ensure that our needs and expectations were being met. When we were en route to Hanoi, we informed Hoa that my wife had developed an ear infection; she immediately directed us to a hospital where the staff spoke English. Best of all, when we told Hoa we would like to meet her in Hanoi to thank her personally for all her wonderful service, she instead thanked us by insisting on treating the four of us to dinner at a lovely local restaurant.In sum, we found an outstanding agency in Viet Prestige -- and made a lifelong friend in Ms. Hoa Pham."

Ms Dinh Thao of Viet Prestige dealt with our queries and subsequent booking both courteously and timely. The Mekong Prestige II was a new boat with excellent accommodation. The staff were both polite and courteous, the food was superb and the shore side visits were very interesting to us as westerners.Thank you again Dinh Thao for helping us to have such a memorable trip."

The vessel was very clean, the cabin large with a very comfortable bed plus verandah. The beer was free as were local wines. The food was very tasty and plentiful. The crew at all times were very polite and kind. Gabrielle who kept us all in good order was great fun and contributed to the mirth and merriment at our table!From Siem Reap to Angkor, Danang, Hoian, Hue, Hanoi and Sapa our itinerary was splendidly organised by Dinh Thao of Viet Prestige Travel. Vehicles and guides from beginning to end of our holiday - all turned up on time.Several interesting shoreside excursions were arranged as was an overnight stop in Halong Bay after Sapa. This was fixed at the last minute. Many photos taken.We believe Viet Prestige Travel is setting up an office in Myanmar for river cruises. We hope to be among their first clients. Thank you Dinh Thao for a most memorable holiday."

The price was better than UK travel agents and we were able to tailor the three week holiday to our specific requirements(flights/hotels). We met up with the cruise in Saigon and enjoyed all the included tours of Vietnam and Cambodia although it was not possible to cross the lake to Siem Reap by boat due to low water levels. The Mekong Prestige II is a brand new vessel with spacious cabins (upper deck recommended) and the quality and variety of food/wine was very good."

We worked with Ms. Dinh Thao and she was extremely helpful, courteous and responded immediately to any requests for more information. We arrived at our hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam on New Year's Eve 2014 just before midnight and were able to watch the fireworks from the 18th floor of our hotel. Our guide arrived early the next morning to take us by air conditioned couch to the river where we boarded the Prestige II to begin our adventure. The boat has 32 cabins, 64 passengers maximum, distributed on two floors. Cabins were very clean, well maintained and comfortable and balconies for all. We thought the cabins were bigger and more comfortable than the balcony rooms on large cruise ships. The third level is a lovely, comfortable and open deck where you can sit under the shade or work on your tan. There is also a jetted tub with cool water to relax in after a shore excursion. Inside on the third level is an air conditioned lounge, bar, spa, and dance floor. The dining room was on the second level and was very comfortable, with linen table clothes, very nice ambiance and air conditioned. The salad, dessert and side courses were served buffet style but the main course was brought to your table. The food was always fresh, delicious and appealing to the eye. The entire crew, from room stewards, wait staff, cooking staff and engineering staff were always considerate, friendly and helpful. Each day we had two separate excursions to places that are not all on the beaten path and we had several surprising means of transportation to get there. We used rickshaws, tuk tuks and ox carts, besides the water taxis to ferry us from the cruise boat to shore. It was a lot of fun and interesting.We had an early morning adventure, usually between 8:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. to avoid the heat of the day. Back to the boat to be greeted with fresh cold towels scented with lemon grass or jasmine, and a cold glass of juice. A blessed treat after a couple of hours in the hot sun. Rested and had lunch about 12:30 p.m. Back out for another excursion at 2:00 p.m through 4:30 p.m. Back to the ship to another delightful greeting. Rested, showered and met in the lounge for the evening cocktail at 7:00 p.m. and dinner at 7:30 p.m. Often there was entertainment, folklore shows, movies, or guest speakers. Never mandatory, you could participate if you chose. Overall, we had a wonderful time, loved the cruise and the adventures. The pace was structured but relaxed. We had been talking about doing a river cruise on the Danube but took this one on a last minute whim. I do believe we it now will be hard to find another river cruise to beat this trip. We had mostly couples, but one father with his 10 y.o. son, and a single woman traveling alone."

Responses from Ms Hoa Pham were efficient and informative. The guides and drivers that were chosen for our trip were excellent, very knowledgeable and most importantly very helpful. Mr Sunny in Ho Chi Minh City and Mr Soouwan in Siem Reap are highly recommended guides - do ask to have their services if you are booking guided tours. Ms Hoa would call almost every other day whilst we were on tour to ensure we were comfortable (even though she was getting married during the same time we were touring!). Not that we had any major issues, but even a minor issue was immediately looked into and sorted out for us by the guides or Ms Hoa.

Hoa changed and adapted our itinerary to suit two old unfit Ozzies and we enjoyed good accommodation and excellent drivers and guides.we had a couple of mishaps one being a bad experience in Halong Bay and Hoa and her Company did what they could to assist. Hoa booked alternative accommodation onshore and paid for this and both she and her Supervisor visited us in Hanoi to offer their apologies and tried to rectify the refund through the shipping line. I have written of my dissatisfaction of Violet Cruises and reiterate to tourists to be wary.we enjoyed all of Vietnam and loved our Mekong Cruise. When we had finished visiting Cambodia we struck another snag, this being that our visa would not allow us reentry into Vietnam. After being stuck at the Siam Rep airport for 2 hours and looking like never being able to leave, we rang Hoa who arranged flight for us to Singapore after transitting in Saigon. Thank you again for this Hoa.I have to add that Hoa did all this work on our behalf on 29th December and she was getting married on 1st January!thank you Hoa and thank you Viet Prestige Travel for a memorable trip."

We visited Hanoi, Tam Coc, Hoi An , Nha Trang and Mekong. At every destination we met a guide who was always on time, was friendly and introduced us to his City. The guides helped us with the places to visit for shopping, trying out the local cuisines and local night markets! And this made a huge difference, cause at every destination we got to experience the place. At the same time, it did not feel intrusive and we roamed the places by ourselves most of the time. I loved the country and I am already thinking of visiting it some day again.Thank you Viet Prestige for such a wonderfully planned trip. We loved it!"

After nice communication by Email Miss Dinh Thao planned and organized the roundtrip perfectly like our wishes. We spent 3 days/2 nights in Halong Bay by King Cruiser. It was a very good experience and a very privat feeling at the boat, the food was excellent and the crew from the boat very friedly. Our guide gets 5 points from us: nice, friendly, helpful, clever, he has the know how...A special kind of experience was the homestay in Mai Chau. We liked the hospitality of our home-family. We went by bicycle through the green ricefields and watched the farmers at their dayly work. It was a little big rustic, but fine and we do'nt like to miss this adventure. Also it was very impressiv to went by bicycle and by boat around Tam Coc, the famous countryside. In Hanoi we were staying in Legacy hotel in the old part of the city. It was very comfortable in the heart of the city to live. You can feel the streetlife directly. All, what Miss Dinh had proposed to do, was perfect for the first trip to North Vietnam in our mind. If we will go back to Vietnam to learn more about this wonderful country, we will do it with Viet Prestige Travel. Our Thank's to this organisation!"

We have just returned from a 10 day family vacation to Vietnam visiting Hanoi,Halong Bay,Hoi An and Ho Chi Minh City which was organised by Hoa Pham from Viet Prestige Travel. Hoa made everything so easy right from the first email inquiring about our trip. Nothing was too much trouble (even with many changes made by us along the way) and the costings were very reasonable.In Hanoi we had the most memorable tour guide,Tom, who helped make this part of our holiday a highlight (even taking us shopping at his favourite clothing outlet!).The Sofitel Metropol was one of the loveliest hotels we have ever stayed in and the Hanoi City tour was informative and tailored to our needs. Our suprise dinner with Hoa was really special and it was so lovely to meet Hoa and be hosted so well.Travel was made very easy by Hoa's attention to detail and we were able to contact her at any time with any queries or suggestions. Our transport vehicles were first rate and spacious and meant we always had a cool van waiting for us and a well informed local able to give us insight into each place we visited.We enjoyed every part of our holiday and loved learning about the history of Vietnam as well as experiencing the wonderful local food and culture it offers.I would definately recommend Viet Prestige Travel and Hoa Pham to anyone planning a trip to Vietnam."

Between Siem Reap and HCMC, we enjoyed a 7-day cruise down the Mekong River and tributaries with Heritage Lines on the RV Jajan cruise ship.The tour program covered as many sites as time allowed at each stop, the meal inclusions on the tour were great, the transportation was first class, and the guides were excellent. They greeted us upon arrival, and transported us to our departure gate at every destination. We never felt isolated or alone.On our Mekong River cruise, there were tours or events every morning and afternoon. We were able to visit small villages, meet with local families, and experience the real lives of the Vietnamese and Cambodian people living there. Each tour program was around 2 hours and well-paced, leaving passengers with ample leisure time to enjoy the passing parade of life along the banks of the Mekong River \u2013 which is fascinating.Many of the tour guides had either personal experiences or family members that were caught up in the turbulent times of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s in Vietnam and Cambodia, and so the stories they were willing to share with us were compelling. In Phnom Penh, the visits to the Choeung Ek Killing Field Memorial and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (formerly Security Prison S-21) were chilling and gut wrenching, but it is important to me that we never forget what happened there, and make sure that it never happens again."

Hoa Pham is an extremely helpful agent who guided me through every step of the process from getting my Vietnamese visa to arranging internal flights. I highly recommend Viet Prestige if you want a personal touch on your tour of Southeast Asis.The hotels were clean and comfortable and the local guides were extremely knowledgeable. Even when things were closed they steered me towards sites off the beaten path like art museums and a crashed bomber in a pond behind apartments.From frenetic streets of Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi to the beauty of Halong Bay in Vietnam the highlights were numerous and amazing. Laos and its night markets and Siem Reap with the iconic Angkor Wat are memories that will last a lifetime and they were made possible by the professionalism of Hoa Pham and everybody at Viet prestige. The best part was that they made a tour around my schedule, not one that they had preset. Other tours tell you when their tours leave. Viet Prestige's tour started when I said I was available. They made my journey very relaxing and wonderful and I would love to travel with them again.If you are going to Vietnam and surrounding countries, you cannot do better than Viet Prestige."

Our 17-days itinerary was intensive (10 destinations with 5 internal flights, boats, cars, etc.) and we were a little concerned about the connection between one destination and the next. Instead, everything was perfect: in each destination a driver and a guide were waiting for us with perfect timing. The choice of local guides, drivers, and type of cars have been always excellent. We have no complaints at all about the services received in all locations. On the contrary, everything was perfect. Also her choices of all the hotels were great.

Good communication and hassle-free experience. They offer a lot of extras like transfers to and from the airport and your hotel. Our stay at Sapa Lodge was nice and actually the agency owners were also travelling with us for the weekend: we felt really special. On the day traveling from Sapa to Halong bay, after the night train we could use a room at the agency office, shower and breakfast before taking the bus to Halong bay. we booked Paloma cruise and was also a very good choice. HalongSapa tours should be definitely your choice for organizing your trip to Sapa and Halong Bay."

We had many questions prior to booking our tour and Cham answered each one professionally and with a very personalized service. Even after we booked Cham kept us well informed and constantly communicated with us. It is very obvious she takes great pride in what she does and will do everything she can to make your trip a success. When I left my E-Reader in the transport van I was able to get a hold of Cham and she arranged its return. If you are going to or Halong Bay or Sapa we would highly recommend using Halongsapa tours. Cham really does go above and beyond what is expected from any tour group. It certainly was just not take your money and book, she really did want to ensure you have a great experience.Thank you again Cham, you were right when you said we would have a great trip with the upgrade."

For our train trip to Sapa, Mr Tien collected us from our hotel, delivered us to the train station and then picked us up when we returned so we could get another hour sleep and shower and eat breakfast at their house....that's a kind of service you won't find anywhere else!

Back then, a friend got injured along the way and we didn't get the full experience so I decided to return with my gf this time. In 2012, all halongsapa tours had was a shopfront to run their business. Today they have an awesome 3 story home (which you can easily locate on Google maps btw) from which they operate our of. Here, they offer you a clean and spacious room to rest between tours with an adjacent bathroom for you to wash and freshen up should you need to. It's definitely much needed before your overnight train to sapa. In a land where communicating in English with local businesses might be a bit of a problem and hassle, halongsapa tours simplifies your life and gives you a hassle free experience. There are guides to pick u up at all locations, be it your hotel, the airport, the sapa train station etc. you won't have a need to worry about food or transportation which is fantastic. We chose the calypso cruiser for halong bay and 3d4n option in sapa and both packages were awesome. The calypso cruise was one notch higher in pricing above their oriental Sails package and for this price difference, what we got was a more intimate and private experience. There were only 4 couples on the boat so we all got the top cabins in the cruise which was fantastic as it was away from the engine room and kitchen. Food was outstanding. In sapa, Ms Cham called ahead to inform them we were coming and that this was our second visit. We got upgraded to a humongous room at the sapa Eden hotel with two king size beds, a lounge and 2 balconies overlooking the sapa valley. It was outstanding. I cannot recommend halongsapa tours enough. And in conclusion, I have this to say. Hospitality can be taught in tourism schools, but sincerity cannot. Ms Cham and her husband had a TON or sincerity in the way they treat you can it shines through. They treat you like family not because you paid for their packages but rather because they genuinely want to have you enjoying your trip. We had a blast with them. We certainly hoe you can would too:)"

On our last day in hanoi..she buzzed me to ask about my trip..and offered a free drop to airport despite having picked us up at hotel for the trip..however , I had already booked .Extended my courtesies for her help..and she wanted to just come over to meet me.She came over to my hotel late night just to say hello with a gift in hand..with promises to reduce rates further for my family member who will travel in april.Cannot tell you how impressed I am with Vietnamese hospitality and humility. Their warmth and courtesy. .it's something to learn for all of us .I have won a friend rather friends in vietnam..and miss Cham is one of them .Do not book randomly through tours onspot..they usually take you to poorer cruise with no guarantee of a first rate experience nor food..itsts better to pay a wee extra and be safe about what u gonna expect .Flipaide of Vietnamese people can be minor and petty cheating ..promising something and delivering something else .We experienced this throughout .So be safe and book through halongaapa.Adding a photo of myself with miss cham..she was the perfect sweetheart .who also extended help to friends by letting them store their luggage at her office and freshen up before boarding flight for an inward journey."

We did a 3 night/2 day trip to Sapa as part of our honeymoon and we were certainly not disappointed. Tien was there at every junction to make sure we were in the right place at the right time. Our taxis were always booked and paid for, and Tien was there to show us to our cabin on the sleeper trains. Completely seemless. When our train arrived back in Hanoi at 5am we wondered what we were going to do but again Tien was there to pick us up, and he brought us back to his house to rest. It was a very welcome added extra, and the breakfast was delicious. Tien even stopped to talk to us over breakfast for over an hour about the history of Vietnam. It was a very interesting morning. Nothing was too much trouble for Cham and Tien. We had booked a trip to Halong Bay with another company (wished we'd booked with Halongsapa), but despite this Cham and Tien offered their house for us to rest after this trip, before our next sleeper train to Da Nang. I have traveled to many places but I have never experienced such a personal and effortless service. Thank you Tien and Cham.

Three days later when we came back from the mountains.... Again they were waiting on the platform at 5 in the morning!!! Again they took us to their place offering us a room and a shower.

I booked a 2D1N Sapa trekking tour with Halongsapa Tours (by bus) at a special rate for my family of three and we had a wonderful experience! The owner, Tien, met us at our hotel the morning we left, and waited with us until our minivan came to ferry us to the luxury coach (Sapa Express). The coach ride was absolutely comfortable with large seats (included water, food and Wifi). It took us directly to Sapa town in less than 6 hours (with 2 stops along the way). The Sapa Eden Hotel, which is family-run, also provided wonderful service and generous portions of delicious home-cooked meals. Although it rained on the second day in Sapa, making the trek muddy and slippery, it was a great experience for my family. The tour in Sapa included all meals.even in the middle of trekking. The hotel allowed us to have a shower before our return journey by coach at 4pm. At the end of our return journey by coach, we were surprised to find Tien waiting for us where the express coach dropped us at Old Quarter, ready with a pre-arranged taxi to ferry us back to our hotel. He followed us on his scooter all the way back to ensure we reached our hotel safely. He also offered us free transport to the airport on the day we left Hanoi. On the morning of our departure from Hanoi, Tien came over to our hotel to see us off personally with an arranged taxi to the airport and even gave us freshly bought Vietnamese cakes for us to bring home. I was simply awed by the care he took to WOW us with such personalized service (hadn't expected that much as the price for the Sapa tour was the lowest I found online). I would definitely recommend my family and friends to engage the services of Halongsapa Tours too."

Ms Cham(owner of Halongsapa Tours) had given us recommendations for our hotels in Sapa and our Halong Bay tour operator and both turned out to be fantastic.

In-between our Sapa and Halong Bay trips we stayed at Ms Chams place, where we had a room and place to shower before we were picked up for our Halong Bay trip. Ms Cham greeted us in the morning with an amazing home cooked breakfast (one of the best we had anywhere in Vietnam) and supplied us with fruit and water for the ride to Halong Bay. we ended up choosing the Calypso Cruiser for our Halong Bay experience and it was a great choice. There are literally hundreds of cruise operators to Halong Bay, and we had read of horror stories of some of the boats and itineraries being nothing like what people had expected when they booked. Upon Ms Chams recommendation the Calypso Cruiser was exactly what we expected and more. The guide - Kent, was quite the character, and a very experienced, humorous and engaging guide. The boat was immaculate, and the rooms were spacious, elegant and clean. The food was delicious and the bay itself is stunning. We again were lucky to meet some great people on the boat and could not have been happier with the service.Overall we highly recommend Halongsapa tours if you are visiting Hanoi and wish to get out and visit these two beautiful areas. Organizing everything on your own can be difficult in Vietnam and Ms Cham made this trip a very seamless and amazing experience."

Cham and Tien were always quick to reply to my emails, and gave us some very helpful advice. It was great to be able to go back to their lovely house when we arrived back to Hanoi from Sapa at 5am. They have spare rooms where you can nap, have a shower and use their wifi. Tien even made us a huge breakfast! If we didn't have their house to go back to we would have had to book an extra night in a hotel so we would have someone to shower and get ready before our trip to Halong Bay. We could also leave all our luggage at their place while we went on the tours. Everything ran smoothly and Cham & Tien made everything stress free. Tien collected our train tickets for our trip to Sapa and even brought us straight to our cabin. They gave us a free night stay in a hotel in Hanoi which was excellent, and also brought us to the airport from the hotel when we left Hanoi. I would definitely recommend Halongsapa tours!"

Lovely couple who extended very personalised services and went out of their way to make us feel safe and comfortable in a foreign land.In Hanoi we were most pleased with our hotel stay at Meracus Hanoi 2 that was highly recommended by Ms Cham for its location. Ms Cham secured the room for us at a very special rate too. She also helped us to book a 2D1N cruise to Halong Bay on Starlight Cruise and a 1-day private tour to beautiful Tran An. For Sapa, we bought a 3N2D package that included a 1-night stay at the luxurious Victoria Sapa Resort, 2-way train tickets on the Victoria Express and 2 trekking tours including all meals. Overall, we had a most enjoyable trip and would highly recommend the services of Halongsapa Tours!"

With everything taken care of we could just enjoy and experience both tours 100%. The only suggestion I can make is to stay more than one night in each area, it certainly deserves that much more time, giving you the extra time to enjoy the areas, locals and activities. Cham and her husband exceeded their services in every area, I would not hesitate to book with them again if I am ever lucky enough to be back in Vietnam and would recommend them to anyone looking for well arranged tours, both before, during and after."

She provided an excellent response with information that was very relevant to the questions that I had and was able to steer me to a lovely choice. The booking of the cruise through Halong Sapa Tours was very easy (just 10% deposit). We also got transport to and from the airport. It was lovely to meet Ms Cham and her husband on our last evening - such a shame it was so rushed. I am a person who spends a lot of time going over every last detail before making a decision (to the extent that I drive myself crazy) but WHEN (not if) I return to Vietnam, I would not hesitate to use Halong Sapa Tours for as much of the arrangements as possible. Let Halongsapa Tours take care of the details so that you can enjoy this wonderful country! Highly recommended."

She helped me answer lots of questions, even questions that were nothing to do with the cruise and she even translated a few things for me from the Vietnamese railway website!

When we came to Hanoi a nice car waited for us to bring us to the hotel. Then we could even left some of our stuff with mr. Tien for safe keeping until we ended our trip. All was great in Sapa even the hotel they recommended was ok, and you can look at my other review. Only thing that happened was that on the way back on night train in our cabin 6 people wanted to stay. And because this si not acceptable for me, max is 4, i called ms. Cham, And you know what in 5 min we got our private cabin with 4 beds just for us :D so thank you Cham. After that we came to their office and home for shower short nap in a really nice room and what a breakfast. After that to halong bay tour again thez choose for us the Oriental sails, and again they did not disappoint. At the end they also took us to the airport and brought our belonging with us.

Went with Ms Cham to organise a Halong Bay cruise based on previous reviews but was disappointed with the lack of responses to my emails and found the experience very frustrating. I frequently had to resend emails after waiting a few days without a reply from her. Halongsapa tour emails did eventually give me the information I required but the response was curt. This was contrary to all other hotels and tour companies in Vietnam who replied with the utmost expediency and with a lovely welcoming tone. The final payment procedure was very unprofessional and a receipt was not forthcoming. I would be hesitant to recommend this company to anyone."

We were taken care of in a most friendly way. We got fantastic suggestions as to which hotels to book. Our hosts organized all the transport from the airport to hotel, then to Ha Long Bay and from there back to the new place we were staying. All went perfectly flawless. In fact, we also could leave our luggage at their own house when we realized it would have been too much hassle to carry all of it for the cruise that lasted only 2 days. Despite being extremely busy our hosts always had time for us, were always cheerful and happy to chat. They also take any feedback you might have about their service very seriously and make sure it is used to improve it in the future. Although it is hard for us to imagine what else they could do as they are example to follow.We highly recommend Halongspa Tours and I am sure that if we are going to come back to Vietnam we are going to call them first!"

Everything ran very smoothly, we had a three hour flight delay and our car wasn't at airport on arrival, but Ms Cham was online at midnight and immediately followed up the driver who was only a few minutes away. Both tours were a great experience for our family, we had a few little upgrades along the way which we very much appreciated. From the only negative review I read about Mr Cham, who is a very nice man and interesting to talk to about day to day life in Vietnam, we could see that he was a little exhausted from all the early morning pickups and tourists he was looking after as April is a very busy time so I think that experience is very unlucky. We stayed at their home to refresh after the train journey, were cooked a lovely breakfast and were well taken care of. I am recommending Halongsapa Tours to friends with families who are also travelling to Vietnam this year as I'm sure they will also have a very special experience with the Chams."

Having been to Hanoi a couple of times in the past, I know the benefit of having a travel/tour agency recommend and book tours for you. It takes the hassle out of winnowing down an extensive choice of tours, provides transfers from airports and too and from and also helps negotiate some of the more difficult aspects of trips like boarding late night trains and finding the right cabins etc.We booked both our Halong 3 night adventure and our 3 night Sapa experience through Cham and Tien. Their service was great and everything went smoothly and hassle free. Cham was even kind enough to do a load of our washing gratis in between our trips. Nothing was too much trouble. Their cruise and accommodation options were right on the mark as well. Highly recommended."

The company is run by a young couple out of Hanoi, Ms. Cham and her husband Tien, who are very nice, honest and accommodating. I don't think that you can find better service in Hanoi so don't hesitate to contact them if you are planning a trip to Vietnam. Ms. Cham was also very prompt in responding to all my email inquiries. I booked a 2D3N Sapa trip with 2 nights on Victoria Express train and 1 night at Sapa Victoria Resort and Spa and a 3D2N Halong Bay cruise on Indochina Sails with free airport-hotel transfer and free Visa on arrival for our family of 8, including my elderly mother. The Sapa trip included 2 days of trekking and I was concerned that my mother would not be able to do it, so Ms. Cham assured me that there will be car service for her. However, when we were in Sapa, there was some misunderstanding about the car service for my mom and the lady at Sapa Eden Hotel, through which the tour was booked, was going to charge us extra for the car service, so I contacted Ms. Cham who was able to straighten out the misunderstanding and apologized for the confusion.Ms. Cham and Tien also let us shower and rest at their place for a few hours after coming back from Sapa at 5am and before leaving for Halong Bay at 8am. Tien also served us breakfast during that time. And we were also able to leave our big suitcases at their place while we were in Sapa and Halong Bay and Tien met us at the airport with our suitcases after the cruise and gave us very nice farewell Vietnamese handcrafted gifts. We were all very impressed with their great service and warm hospitality and wish them big success and good luck in their business."

WE were on our honeymoon and Ms. Cham obviously told the cruise company this so when wer arrived on the boat we were told we would be moved to the 5 * boat! This was an amazing upgrade as they put us in the huge suite on the boat at the back with a hot tub and balcony. It really made our trip that much better. On the shuttle back to the airport ms. cham's husband picked us up and on arrival at the airport we were given a lovely gift.All in all they added a great happiness to our trip Thanks for doing great work guys!"

We often arrived very early in the morning or quite late in the afternoon, either way, we were always met by someone holding a placard with our name on it. At one point in our travels, Tien even took us back to his own home to allow us to shower and then cooked breakfast for us. They offered us a quiet reassurance that was friendly, professional and stress free. Tien had a fantastic knowledge of the roads and traffic which also made us feel very safe.

We used Cham and Tien from HalongSapa Tours for the Halong Bay and Sapa part of our travels through Vietnam and they were the perfect choice!We are pretty independent travelers but we thought it would be a good idea to have someone else look after the first part of our journey while we settle in to our trip and we were so glad we did.Cham responds promptly to every email and helped arrange our VOA before we set off - we collected from the Airport with a slight delay but the driver arranged (complimentary) by Cham waited patiently in arrivals for us and transferred us professionally to our hotel.We stayed for 2 nights in Hanoi and on the third Tien met us at our hotel with our transfer to the train station for our overnight train to Sapa. He introduced us to our cabin companions - a Kiwi couple you we became good friends with for the rest of our trip in Vietnam - and then guided us through the station, to the train and in to our cabins and then detailed what will happen when we arrive in Lao Cai. The cabins were lovely, flowers and complimentary water and fruit. We later learnt from fellow travelers not all sleeper cabins were this nice!From Lao Cai we were met off the train and transferred with a group to our hotel in Sapa for breakfast. We chose Sapa Eden hotel and were not disappointed; amazing views and wonderful host named Trang. Refreshed and fed in the hotel we started on our trek with our guide Ue to our homestay - leaving our bigger bags with Trang at the hotel.The trek and homestay were stunning - probably the highlight of our trip and one of the best travel experiences we've had. Next day and another trek then a short transfer back to Sapa and a night in our hotel.We then began our transfer back to Hanoi after lunch. Dinner near Lao Cai station where we received our train tickets and then overnight back to Hanoi in equally good cabins. Tien met us off the train and took us back to their house were we showered, took a nap and had breakfast before our transfer to Halong Bay.We'd been upgraded to a 5 Star boat for our Halong Bay cruise and the room was stunning (Hot tub included!) Next day it was back to Hanoi and we were dropped off to our hotel - Tien dropped off our big bags that we had left with them while we were in Halong as well as a bag of washing they had kindly helped us with.On our transfer to the airport to fly south we had some confusion with the taxi - we didn't realise Tien had organised this for free and we had already paid the hotel for a transfer. When we went down to check out we were surprised to see Tien and he talked with the hotel staff you then refunded the money we had paid for the transfer! Amazing!Hopefully this puts in context just how far Cham and Tien go for you, for the price you pay the service is excellent. I couldn't recommend HalongSapa tours highly enough!"

Having done our research, and heard lots of warnings about other dubious tour companies, hearing the glowing reviews for Halongsapa convinced us it was the one to go for. Everyone is right - they're fantastic. Everything was as described, and they were very helpful accommodating our travel arrangements. Mr Tien even brought us some lunch when he picked us up to take us back to the airport, and refused a tip for it - they're a really nice family.The boat trip itself was lovely, the food some of the best we had in Vietnam, and the bay stunning. Excellent value for the money - and extremely helpful and friendly service. Due to a storm, no boats could leave the bay on the day we were due to leave. It wasn't a problem though - we called the guy up and booked onto a boat the next day (when the weather was much better). I wish we'd done the 2 nights trip. So if you're planning a trip to Ha Long, go with Ha Long Sapa."

Thank you, Cham for patiently, and promptly replying to my concerns in a personalized way, and impeccably taking care of the logistics...pickups etc... for our Halong Bay tour on the Starlight (our cabin, #401, was literally, picture perfect). Also, Tien, for talking with the Concierge at our hotel, and making sure that arrangements were made to promptly get me to a photography store in Hanoi, so I could replace my non-working battery charger. You went the extra mile and it was much appreciated. Also, the lacquer-plate departure gift..a nice touch to conclude a wonderful trip. And to Minh, our tour guide, for whom without your assistance and attentiveness, we would not have been able to do the cave tour. I know this reads like an Academy-award script...however, each of you earned our praise and recognition for a job well-done. Taking your cruise on Halong Bay, following a 16-hour plane trip and a short night's sleep was an excellent, and much-needed relaxing way to kick off what was a marvelous vacation. The peace and tranquility of the Bay, the beauty of the rock formations, the company of other tour boats and local vessels on the Bay blended together to make this tour a perfect tone-setting experience for our vacation. The Bay, in contrast to some reviews about it being strewn with garbage, was pristine clear during our tour of December 22-23, 2014. It rates its designation as a must-see UNESCO Heritage site. After considering and communicating with many others, and getting canned responses that did not address our concerns, thanks again to Cham and your team for your caring responses to my numerous emails and your professionalism. Booking a tour in a distant country with an unknown tour company is not the easiest thing to do. We made the right choice in selecting your Company, and would, without hesitation, make the same choice today.Highly recommend, if you're in this part of the world and are considering \"doing the Bay\", you go with Halongsapa Tours."

Our family of 4 booked Halong Bay and Sapa through them and everything was flawless. Tien was waiting for us at the airport and dropped us to our hotel, even though we had a few spare days before doing any of the activities that we arranged through them. He gave us great advice on things to do while he drove us that day. It was so nice having someone meet us at the airport in a country we had never been to before.Then came the day we were to be picked up go to Halong Bay. Tien arrived at our hotel to make sure the Halong Bay driver that was driving us was on time, had a chat, then helped us load our luggage in the van and we parted ways. About 10 minutes later after the tour had picked another family up, we realised we had left our passports in our hotel reception's safe (Crikkey !!!). We tried to explain to our driver who didn't quite understand, so he called Tien and handed the phone to us to which we explained. Tien told us not to worry, then briefly spoke to the driver again. We were so happy and relieved about 5 minutes later when our van stopped on a street corner, and there was Tien, who calmly handed us our passports. He had gone back to the hotel to retrieve them the rode his motorbike to meet us on the corner!On returning from Halong Bay, we stayed at their family home for about 6 hours to wait for our train to Sapa. They made us feel so welcome and comfortable.All their arrangements for Sapa was like clockwork and ran so smoothly we had such a nice relaxing time.Our train back to Hanoi took a few hours longer than expected (not Halongsapa's fault), but Tien was waiting by our carriage when we stepped out, and had some fresh fruits and breads for us, such a lovely thought.The night before we left Hanoi, we went out for dinner with Tien and Cham, and had a nice chat and catch up, as if we were old friends. Something they didn't have to do but took time out to.The next morning Tien was there again bright and eary to take us to the airport.All in all, they provide service that exceeds expectations, and they are more like friends than a tour company. And they do so many extras like Visa letters and pick ups and in between stays. We will want to meet up with them when we eventually go back!"

An email stated 6:15am pick up and the confirmation timetable had 7:15am (we missed this tiny typo) Staff at our hotel rang Halongsapa and it was all sorted very quickly :) A staff member from Halongsapa came over to the hotel and sorted our transfer and was very helpful. Many thanks for a fantastic experience."

            "review": "First Class Tour Company. It is hard not to be skeptical when booking tours with agents from Vietnam, but HalongSapa Tours is an exceptional company to do business with. I started to contact Cham in June for our tours in December. There was no pressure in selling their tours but just frank opinions on different options available. Their prices are also very reasonable. So we booked our Sapa and Halong Bay cruise with them nearly half a year ahead with just 10% deposit via paypal. We paid the rest when we arrived at their office before the Sapa tours.As other reviewers had mentioned, airport pickup, transfer to and from train station, room to rest and shower plus breakfast in between tours, hotel pickup again for departure, everything worked out well. By the way, all these services are complimentary when you book tours with them. And the cost can be significant because when we visited Hanoi 2 years ago, airport transfer was already US$20 per way and for a bigger group, the cost would be higher, not to mention wasted time, trouble with foreign language and other inconveniences should we take upon ourselves to do things our way to get from point to point.Payment for the day tour to Ninh Binh arranged when we arrived was not collected until the day we left. This is the kind of confidence and trust they build up with customers that deserve a recommendation. And of course, the departure gift from Cham and Tien as a token of appreciation for our business which shows they are not taking us for granted. A first class tour company indeed and a pleasure to do business with them."

            "review": "Highly recommended. We are sceptical when booking tours via internet. After reading all the nice reviews about Halongsapa Tours, we decided to give it a try by booking the recent Halong Bay and Sapa tours through Halongsapa Tours. We arrived at Hanoi Airport in the afternoon on 13 Dec ad were met by a taxi driver arranged by Halongsapa Tours. The taxi driver drove us straight to our hotel. The next morning, we were met by Mr Cham and a big van was ready to bring us to the Halong bay. Mike, our tour guide from Oriental Sails was a new tour guide only two months after getting the tour guide licence. He was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable despite being new and sincere in ensuring that we have a memorable time. Halong Bay is a nice place with beautiful scenery. We finished the Halong Bay tour on 15 Dec and was driven back to Mr Cham's home cum office and stayed there till time for us to board the overnight soft-sleepers train to Sapa. Mr Cham accompanied us to the train station and showed us to our cabin. We arrived early in the morning on 16 Dec and a big van was ready to send us to our Hotel, Sapa Eden Hotel, a beautiful hotel overlooking the rice terraces and fantastic view. At the morning breakfast, a cheerful and spirited Miss Drang greeted us and prepared a good breakfast for us. She also prepared dinner and lunch for us which were really delicious. Sightseeing and trekking were as planned. We had a memory time in Sapa and reluctantly left on 17 Dec and reached Hanoi via the overnight train at bout 4.45am on 18 Dec and Mr Cham was there waiting for us and brought us back to his home again for wash up and breakfast. We did not want to trouble Mr Cham too much and requested him to call for a taxi to bring us to our hotel. Mr Cham called for the taxi and paid for the taxi fare.Halongsapa Torus is a husband and wife team. Mr Cham has a young son. They are genuine, sincere and definitely reliable. Mrs Cham met us at our hotel on 19 Dec and gave us a nice souvenir. Both Mr & Mrs Cham with their son bid us goodbye at the hotel. Should you want to book tour to Halong Bay and/or Sapa, do consider Halongsapa Tours."

We also got our airport pickups and drop offs included.Everything was 100% reliable as promised and all pick ups were right on time.

Mrs Cham came to the hotel to meet us when we were picked up to leave for the airport. She was a lovely person and gave us some nice gifts which was so thoughtful and very unexpected.

We visited Hanoi again this year in September and again booked our tours with Halongsapa tours, we first used Halongsapa tours last year ( last review is from 2013 not 2014). We chose to use Halongsapa Tours again because Cham & Tien give a 100% to ensure you have a good holiday. We booked several tours with them this year, our Halong Bay tour was wonderful & as we were going directly to Hoi An from Halong Bay Cham & Tien had a driver pick us up just out of Hanoi to take us straight to the airport. In my opinion book your tours with the best, (Halongsapa Tours) forget the rest."

It is indeed well recommended and I must say the operators of this agency both husband and wife team is really awesome.

From airport pick up and transfer to train station to Sapa and back to Hanoi, all went smoothly without a hitch. The breakfast that they had prepared for us during our short stay at their home office when we are back in Hanoi from our Sapa Trip during the early morning, we can see that they really went to the extra mile to provide us a simple and a wonderful breakfast with the pastries that they bought. Last but not least, thank you Mr Tien and Ms Cham and the wonderful gift we received from you on our last day.

I wrote my TripAdvisor review for Halongsapa Tours almost 3 years ago but at that time they did not have anything specific set up on TA for their company (fairly new) so my review got lost in all of the Halong Bay Tour Company internet reviews. Now that their site is set up I have decided to re-post my review. I thought I was special when I received the royal treatment but I can now see from the other, more recent reviews (every single one with an Excellent rating!) that they treat all of their Customers this well. My wife and I have travelled to every continent (except Antarctica) on extended trips (2-4 months) over the past 4 years since retiring and we have not come across any other tour company that provided anything close to the same above-and-beyond personal and professional service. And at a very competitive cost.They provided us with some lasting memories. I'm sure they will do the same for you.\u201cHalongSapa Tours\u201d5 of 5 stars Reviewed 11 April 2012 We went to Halong Bay and had a terrific time. It was all made possible by the hard-working husband and wife team (Tien & Cham) of HalongSapa Tours in Hanoi. We had such a wonderful time that we booked a second trip to Sapa through them and had a great experience both times. The price of their tours is very competitive (cheaper than most) but the best part in dealing with them is the exceptional customer service that they provide, taking all the worries out of your travel adventures. Tien personally escorted us to our cabin on the Sapa-bound train and met us on our return at 5 am, assisting us back to our guest house. There were several other unexpected benefits that they provided for us making our tours truly memorable and highlights of our SE Asia trip. We rarely provide reviews but since we had such a positive experience, we wanted to share that with other tourists so that they could make the most of their travel choices as well.Mike & Rhonda (Canada) Visited March 2012"

The trip was amazing.I started contacting Cham since March 2014 and she was always very responsive and persistence in following up on the itinerary provided. I was very careful on the selection of the hotels, proposed itinerary as we had few elderly in the group of 9 people. I made few comparison before settled on HalongSapa Tours in Aug, frankly they are not the cheapest, but due to her patient, persistency and professionalism, which gave me a lot of comfort as I want a value for money trip. Indeed, prices was competitive after considering airport, SAPA and Halong BAY transfer, meals and flawless. The cruise was a fantastic experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our cruise, great food, clean, tidy and comfort room, good staffs and great activities. Cham is very accommodating, open and sincere, I can see and feel that she wants to ensure customers are happy and constantly striving for high customer satisfaction. i.e request for in depth knowledge tour guide , then she specially arranged a local speaking expert tour guide and our arranged Chinese Speaking tour guide to guide us during the visit to HoaLu without additional charges. Cham and Tien met up in the hotel upon arrival and ensure the whole trip is well organized. Tien also escorted us onto the train from Hanoi to Sapa and then he picked us up at 4.30 on our return on the night train and took us back to a temporary hotel for a shower and breakfast. Cham and Tien with their only son even made the effort to meet us at our hotel after our trips, despite of her unwell after travelled long journey by boat and car, and we were gifted with local cakes. It is very warm and amazing.In summary, I was hesitant in arranging a trip online in 3rd world country, especially I never met the owner; little information about the travel agency, and wasn\u2019t provide details information. i.e Train schedule, tour guide name ; but it all worked out as planned and amazing trip; hassle free and pleasant journey.it is definitely value for money trip.Thank you Cham & Tien, it is appreciated and I hope we catch up again!!"

I wanted to visit Halong Bay and once in Vietnam, you realise just how much choice there is and how many places you can book. I contacted Halongsapa Tours asking about a Halong Bay trip and was given a list of recommended boat companies they worked with, 3 within each price bracket. Within each price bracket, one of the 3 companies was highlighted as the best value - not always the most expensive either.As we were in low season, we were offered a few extras such as a cabin upgrade and free travel to/from Halong Bay. Free airport transfers are a given if you book with them too. Cham also seemed to be the only person I contacted who understood that I wanted to share a room with my 2 young children and arranged a mattress on the floor. I contacted the actual boat company we sailed with for a quote, whilst I was emailing Cham, and they were insistant the 3 of us could not share a cabin, that we had to book 2 cabins. But Cham sorted it for me...The price was great, so we booked with Halongsapa tours for a very small deposit. Everything was as it should be. We were collected at the airport, the bus turned up to collect us for Halong, we were given our upgraded cabin plus we had our airport transfer upon our return. The husband and wife team, Cham and Tien, was just outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble and it was great having a decent chat with Tien on the way to the airport. He even came running back into Hanoi airport to find us to give us a little \"Thank you for using us\" present! It's clear they are passionate about their country and even more passionate about giving visitors to their country the very best experience possible. They both know what it takes to run a business very well.Absolutely amazing service. And absolutely amazing prices.

There are so many boat and agency options to make an easy choice that one can get easily frustrated in the selection process. We booked Indochina Sails 2D1N and were very pleased. It was low season, so we didn't experience all the issues related to excessive traffic. Great food, beautiful rooms and bathrooms. If you go, I highly recommend booking through Halongsapa Tours (online). All the superlative comments found about this agency and their husband and wife team are spot-on! I booked with them (after asking Ms. Cham for her pros and cons on the options I had researched). Upon arriving in Hanoi, several locals approached me and asked if I had pre-booked from the U.S., where apparently many people overpay. I found that Halongsapa had highly competitive, if not the best, local rates. I also did another day tour with them at approximately 50% of what was being offered by other local agencies! Apart from low prices, what really sets them apart is the total approach with their customers. After returning to Hanoi, they personally transported us to the airport the following day (free of charge), including a last minute tourist stop on the way that I requested. What is their key to success vs. other agencies? Low prices AND service. One afternoon before my tour I tried to find their office (don\u2019t try!); they operate out of their house (I was warmly welcomed in), which allows them to keep operating costs (internet and phone line) to a minimum and pass on the savings (one could argue that these are not even incremental costs). And they clearly understand how superior customer service (and word-of-mouth) can drive a business. It is great to see how some entrepreneurs \u201cget it\u201d in economies that are booming under free-market policies like Vietnam. Don\u2019t think twice\u2026take it from this experienced traveler and go with Ms. Cham and Halongsapa Tours!!!"

Cham and her husband Tien were fantastic, they picked us up from the train station at 4.30am when we arrived back from Sapa and took us back to their home for a rest, shower and breakfast before taking us to our bus to go to Halong Bay. Our Halong Bay tour was cancelled about 5mins out of the bay, due to bad weather. Where most travel companies charge a fee for the bus travel taken and the lunch served before returning to Hanoi Cham and her husband return 100% of the tour paid. Thank you Cham and Tien for the fantastic service. I will use Halongsapa Tours again."

Booked halong Bay cruise , Sapa with accommodation, overnight train and treks, day trip to Hoa Lu, Tam Coc, including pick ups from airport, use of a day room at their house/office, and our VOA letter. All flawless (except for us missing our free airport pickup which caused them some stress but was my fault). Very nice couple who run this organisation. The whole process was made easy for us. 10% deposit paypal and pay the rest on arrival. Dont hesitate to use."

After spending a lot of time looking at booking options online, I finally settled on Halongsapa Tours to book our overnight trip on Halong Bay, and it as the best decision I could have made. Cham answered all of my queries in great detail, provided us with a number of overnight cruise options at difference price levels, and gave us a very competitive price for our cruise. It's no exaggeration to say that the professional but personal service offered by Cham and her husband was the best we have received from a travel company, and we are looking forward to using their services again to visit Sapa on our next trip to Vietnam. It's difficult to know where to start planning a holiday in Vietnam, as there are so many tour operators, but you won't be sorry if you book through Halongsapa Tours. I can't recommend them highly enough."

The cruise was magical. Two luxury rooms on a deluxe boat with brilliant & attentive staff and food to die for. The scenery is breathtaking!Cham and her husband Tran at Halong Sapa Tours, Hanoi not only organised the boat trip but also a transfer from Hanoi Airport and train tickets from Hue to Da Nang.Everything went exactly to plan and dealing with Cham by email from the UK was a pleasure.Tran even dropped us at the airport after our boat trip saving us a trip back into central Hanoi. As we said goodbye & Thank you, he kindly presented us with gift from him & his wife! A very personal touch!If you are visiting Northern Vietnam and want a professional, honest & reliable agent to take care of all your travel needs, look no further than the brilliant Halong Sapa Tours."

            "review": "miles above and beyond. Obviously the choice of tour operators is bordering on overwhelming and trying to find one in a foreign country is generally met with slight cynicism and understandably so, with both negative and positive reports seemingly flowing freely. For us, this was our Honeymoon and we were leaving nothing to chance as everything had to be as close to perfect as humanly possible!In my personal opinion, in all my years of travelling and using tour operators I honestly have never met someone so open, honest and accommodating as Ms. Cham and her husband from Halongsapa tours. The correspondence between us was prolific to say the least, with some 30 emails exchanged before we finalised our tour and paid our bill. Every single email was answered dutifully and objectively and no question however minor or mundane was washed over.We were provided with objective comparisons between Halong Bay Junks, trains vs planes, hotels and indeed pretty well every aspect of travelling in Vietnam was eventually covered and it really is testament to Ms. Cham's patience and high level of customer service that our experience of Vietnam and its people is one which will remain fondest in our memories.I even managed to wash my passport 3 days prior to our Honeymoon (not a good start i know!!) and the resulting last minute cancellations and alterations to tours and visa's, and of course the panic that went with it, was met with a cool compassion i've rarely experienced and turned what could have well been a disaster into a mere uncomfortable hurdle!Even after everything Ms. Cham had done for us, she took yet another unexpected step above the rest, by meeting us at our hotel after our Halong Bay tour and we were gifted with a beautiful present to celebrate our marriage. Such an amazing gesture by such an incredible person.I really can't recommend Halongsapa Tours enough, and I know from our experience that you will not be disappointed."

We also booked train tickets with them for a trip to Sapa. Email communication was excellent and I think I also phoned them to make sure I was dealing with someone real. WOW is all we can say! The level of service and the lengths this couple will go to to make your holiday a dream was impressive to say the least. Owners of Halongsapa Tours, Cham and husband Tien are the loveliest couple and they go above and beyond to make sure your experience is second to none. To list all the things they did would take up too much space! Feel certain you are in extremely capable and trusting hands if dealing with this company. You will not regret it. Thank you Cham and Tien! We remember fondly our time in Hanoi and the north which was all the better for your kindness, generosity and genuine care. Anthony and Linda, Brisbane, Australia (experienced travellers). Late to review as their listing is only now available on Trip Advisor."

Chams husband picked us up from the airport as part of there service when we booked and took us to our hotel 2 days before we went on there trip!! this was so kind of them and they are honest to there word. I was only sorry after lots of emails with Cham that i never met her as she kindly left a presents for me on my birthday at the hotel, for my return from the trip. The trip was everything they promised and much more, the food was the best we tasted in vietnam and was treated with a 5 star experience. I recommend this company to everyone that wants to do the Halong bay tour, not forgetting your pit stop in Hanoi which Cham will help organise, without being intrusive. Fantastic family business, will use them again when we are next in Hanoi, they truly are fantastic, and made the start of our tour of Vietnam very exciting with lots of beautiful memories."

We decided to drop into the guys to get a price on the Halong Bay 3 days 2 nights and after 10 minutes discussion we booked which turned out to be the best decision. The entire package was excellent and full off many surprises. I would suggest to anyone thinking about a trip to Halong Bay that they book through Indochina, the highlight of the whole trip was the last night on Freedom Island which I can only say is a hidden paradise where you are able to chill out or go adventure by yourself. I found the tour guide to be a lovely character who really made the experience better. The staff at Indochina are extremely helpful and friendly and Paul and the guys are very interested in how the overall experience went after. For me 10/10RyanFrom Ireland"

Paul was very helpful giving us honest, clear advice about our options and what was available elsewhere, with us eventually deciding to visit both Sapa and Ha Long Bay.In Sapa, Paul arranged an overnight sleeper bus and for us all to be met on arrival by Shu Shu, a local lady who would be taking care of us during our visit. The journey was comfortable and straightforward.When we arrived we were met with smiles and taken for breakfast, after which we started hiking around the beautiful countryside. Paul called to ensure everything had gone smoothly and wish us an enjoyable trip.I'm not usually into trekking but Sapa was breathtaking, and would recommend this activity to anyone wishing to experience Northern Vietnam.Shu Shu welcomed us into her home, introduced us to her family, and cooked an amazing meal, which all contributed to an authentic local experience. It was a pleasure to experience Sapa like this, as most of our time was spent with locals away from the tourist areas. All in all, this trip was my highlight of Vietnam which I would recommend to anyone.A couple of days later Paul at AIT arranged for us to to visit Ha Long Bay on a day trip. As previously, this was arranged quickly and without any issues.We were picked up and dropped back off at our hostel, and taken care of all the way. The boat at Ha Long was clean and comfortable, the included seafood lunch was delicious also.We got to kayak around the bay, also visiting the caves. Whilst I would have liked to have spent more time at Ha Long my visa wouldn't allow for it, however as a day trip I would highly recommend the one we booked through AIT.For those staying in Hanoi and looking to book tours or travel, I would highly recommend Adventure Indochina Travel. The service we received was second to none and the experiences have created fantastic memories from Northern Vietnam."

The most incredible homestay experience we have had throughout the whole of SEA.

Best Vietnamese food we've had to date all prepared by the family. Paul kept in constant contact with Shu Shu to ensure everything was going smoothly which was really thoughtful and a lovely touch to the tour. Definitely the best experience so far in the whole of Vietnam!! I would HIGHLY recommended to anyone who wants an authentic experience of Sapa. Halong bay- this tour was also very good although the long travelling time it's definitely worth it!! We also organised this with adventure indochina travel as our Sapa trip was so fantastic! By far the best and easiest travel company we have come across in our 3 months round SEA. If your in Hanoi I wouldn't recommend going anywhere else!!"

Paul was in frequent contact with me during the run up to the trip, discussing options of tour companies, tailoring the route, adjusting for budget etc. When we arrived in Vietnam and saw the prices of other tour companies, we realised what a good deal we were getting! Throughout the trip, we could rely on the advice of Paul and his colleagues, who checked up to see how we were getting on. Paul even met up for a drink while we were in Hoi An, since he was in the area, a personal touch I can't imagine most travel companies would go to such lengths to do. Through Indochina Travel we booked a food tour in Hanoi and overnight trips to Halong Bay and the Mekong Delta, all of which we could scarcely fault! I don't usually go through travel companies to arrange a trip, normally preferring to do the research and bookings myself, but the advice, attention to detail, extremely friendly service and great rates made our entire trip go very smoothly and it was a thoroughly enjoyable few weeks. I would strongly recommend this company and wish it every bit of success in the future!"

We booked three tours through Kathy, one was the Hanoi City tour, another was a Hanoi street food tour and finally a 4 day Sapa treking adventure. The city tour was OK with the main sites visited but the trip to the ceramic factory a lenghy and wasteful trip. It was not on the tour description but a visit to the Ethnology Muesem was but we did not go there.The Hanoi street food tour was excellent! We had a delightful guide, Anna, who took us to local food stalls to eat the typical meals that local Hanoi residents eat. I cannot recommend this tour enough but more importantly Anna because she made the experience so memorable.Our last tour was a 4 day Sapa trekking adventure. This tour has you leaving Hanoi by night train, once in Sapa you walk to Cat Cat village. Cat Cat is not really anything special in fact it's a tourist trap and really to be avoided. Day 2 had us hiking into the valley to the H'mong village for a homestay. This was by far the best part of the Sapa trip, walking up and down hills and valleys, through rice paddys and rain and bamboo forests. A warning the hiking can be very strenuous, the trail muddy and slippery so ensure you are fit and do wear good boots with plenty of grip. The home stay is basic but does have showers and toilets, much to the relief of our female trekkers. The final day was an easier and shorter hike before a transfer back to Sapa for the night train to Hanoi. Take note, the night train is not a great place to sleep as the train does stop a few times and the constant rocking makes sleeping difficult. An alternative would be the bus to Sapa which is shorter in time than the train and takes you direct to Sapa as opposed to the train station in Lao Cai.Kathy was great to deal with, just be aware that the tours may differ and can be tailored to your requirements."

She even did our laundry for us. We travelled through Hanoi, Halong Bay and Sapa all with private guides and transportation. kathy arranged it all and it was all perfect. Halong Bay is a must, and the beauty is incredible. the ginger cruise boat was great and we wished we had stayed two nights instead of only one. Sapa was beautiful as well.

We spent 7 days in Vietnam altogether: two in Sapa, two in Halong Bay, two in Hanoi, and one motorbiking through the countryside. I think our trip would have been very different if we didn't have such great guides and Kathy who did it all."

The cruise we booked was unfortunately disappointing but this was not the agency's fault. The cruise operator neglected to inform the agency about a change in itinerary and boat maintenance which disrupted our trip. Upon our return Kathy listened to all of our concerns and really wanted to help us. She contacted the cruise operator and negotiated a refund for us. On top of that she refunded the commission that the agency received for the trip. Really couldn't have asked for better service :)"

He really spoke to us in depth about what we wanted with our trips so we knew what we was paying for. He showed us pictures as his experienced most of the Halong Bay cruises himself which was good. Decided on a cruise and booked it. It was amazing, the boat was what we expected and The food was good also. We stopped one night on monkey island which was a nice experience. He doesn't over sell the products so you get let down. From Halong Bay cruises to airport taxis this is your place to go to. Highly recommended. And thanks again the Indochina team."

I am travelling through vietnam and for 2 weeks solo so meeting somebody I could trust to put me in the right direction in Hanoi was most welcoming.I chatted to Paul about what I was looking for in a trip to halong bay. People roughly my own age (31) and who were after a fun trip as well as seeing all the sights. He definately delivered as I was on a cruise with a great bunch and we had a fantastic time. Most of the other tour operators were only interested in booking me on the first cruise available and it wasn't going to be what I wanted. Also on returning, the office contacted me to see how my trip went and Paul invited me back down for a chat and a coffee as I had told him the rest of my week in Hanoi was not planned. Again he fixed me up with a great trip to sapa and directed me to the main sights to find around hanoi cityThoroughly recommended"

The smells the noises and the constant dodging and weaving of cars and scooters. We had originally agreed between the three of us traveling that we will stick to a vague plan, however our friend had recommended these guys and told us to approach Paul, a quick witted Irishman with tonnes experience and advice.Once we had found this lovely little office we were immediately greeted by a warm and friendly smile, as if we had just returned home. To our surprise the Irish vagabond that we had heard so much about was no where to be seen, as we had arrived on his one day off that week. However we had been assured by another lovely employee Linh that we would get exactly the same service standard from anyone in the office.Linh was exceptional, her customer service in my opinion was unrivalled and was very patient with us. She helped us with recommendations and explained in great detail where we had to be and when, which was extremely helpful. Linh helped us organise a two night three day Ha Long Bay party cruise with a company called Oasis, was well fun and we met a lot of cool and like minded people. The conversation eventually came up with the other party goers about how much we all paid, and it was truly a pleasure to hear that we had been given the best deal in comparison to some of the others on the cruise. Linh had also organised our Sapa leg of the journey. I highly recommend this if in Vietnam. We experienced the most amazing scenery and encountered some the kindest people you'll ever meet, even though the little girls selling bracelets can get old (never tell them maybe, they will follow you). We stayed in two guest houses along the way and everything went smoothly without any hiccups which is a really nice feeling when abroad and with quite a significant language barrier.Last thing I would like to mention and give a shout out to is Katherine (from the office) organising to come with us and paying for our taxi to the train station after hours to see us off to Sapa, Thanks so much! Im end you would be silly not to book with these guys if planning any tours in Vietnam, they treat you like a family member and don't see you as a quick dollar.Thanks heaps for everything guys if you are reading this , we will see you soon!

We would highly recommend Adventures Indochina and I'll be using them again when I am back in Vietnam in September. Thanks very much!"

Prior to having any accommodation booked or even an itinerary planned, I made my way to them and multiple other agencies to see what's on the table. They are extremely friendly and helpful, and don't put any pressure on you to book anything. Their prices are fair and service is fantastic. Their motive is to help rather than make money, and to make Vietnam a wonderful experience for all! Even though I opted to do a personal off the beaten path trip to Sapa (i.e not an organized tour), Paul and his crew gave me the resources I needed (local's contact info, bus schedules, train schedules, etc). I already feel like i'm a part of their family!"

Tam Coc daytour and 2 days trekking in Sapa. The daytour in Tam Coc is my favorite experience in Vietnam until now. It was so well organized, great tourguide, Tam Coc was so beautiful and the itinerary was so great! First we visited some tempels and then we did this amaaazing rowboat trip at Tam Coc surrounded with stunning nature. We finished the day with a fun bike tour through a village, with stunning views as well. I absolutely loved it ! The Sapa tour was amazing and beautiful as well, and our homestay family was so nice. Great experience! Only minus point here was that Kathy said the trekking was not hard at all. But it were the hardest 12 km we ever did haha. The whole group was exhausted and everybody was constantly falling on the tiny slippery pathways in the mountains and rice fields. It was really fun and adventurous. But way too long! But for the rest, it was also amazing.Thank you Adventure Indochina!"

I had been told about Adventure Indochina Travel from a friend the night before, rave reviews I might add, so took myself along the following day to sort myself out. As soon as I walked through the door I was greeted with a smile and instantly knew I was in the right place. Within 15 minutes Ivy had established what I wanted/needed and had me booked on everything and ready to go. I had done a little research on the cost of things and was offered a really fair price right of the bat.After my trip was booked, at no extra cost she then went above and beyond to sort my hotel for the next few nights in Hanoi. She walked me to 2 different hotels, a mid and a high range as requested and negotiated a good price for me. AMAZING !!!. In summary don't go planning ya Vietnam trip months in advance, get yaself to Hanoi, go see Ivy at Adventure Indochina Travel and she will sort you out. A very happy customerChey"

For the trip to Sapa they gave me the advice to just book the bus and find a homestay after arrival, which is the best option. There are so many lovely local women ( most of them call themselves \"Mama ...\" ) who can bring you to their home and also guide you for a trek. For Halong Bay I booked a tour with Lemon Cruise via Adventure Indochina Travel. This was just perfect! I loved it! Paul tried to find the right tour to fit my expectations and where most probably are people from the same age group. Well, he succeeded.

They were really decent and gave us good prices, tried their best to make sure we'll get the best service and prices + gave us the best exchange rate we've received during our 3 weeks in Vietnam. All the trips were really good organized and the Hot line was useful. SAPA  we took 4 nights 3 days by bus which was very convenient for us.The trip was good, beautiful, the home stay was nice experience. The guide was just OK we felt we didn't learn enough about Sapa. We slept at the Bamboo hotel (the agency changed the location from the panorama hotel because they are on construction). The bamboo hotel has an amazing view from the room but other then that we didn't like the hotel, the food wasn't good for our taste. HALONG BAY lemon cruise - the boat that goes to another area, it wasn't that good at all, we had bad smell from the toilet during the stay, the food was laim and not tasty at all. The first day is the kayak - amazing experience, beautiful place. The second day is a cave, nothing special, we heard about better views then this one. Also they said in the boat at the beginning that there will be a Tai Chi lesson in the morning and afterwards said that there won't be one because only 4-5 star boats have it. Having said that - in total we enjoyed our trips and we'll recommend on this agency. "

I participated in a Halong bay day trip and a local food tour, both arranged through Indochina travel. very clear information given at the time of booking, which really helped. the food tour really stood out - a great cultural experience, visiting unusual eating places - many family run and some selling only one dish ! its a real must do and gives insite into the culture of Hanoi - not just the food. I would recommend both trips and the indochina company - they were really organized and helpful throughout . A special thank you to Ms. Giang, who was very patient with me, and let me take my time with my choices, no hassle, just a lovely smile."

            "review": "Good service, but disappointing Halong Bay tour. The service was good, our adviser was very helpful at discussing our options with different companies and cruise types. He showed us a tour for $55pp but said it wasn't a good tour, and recommended a tour for $80pp. We took this recommendation and decided to fork out a little extra to ensure we weren't disappointed. However the three best things about the tour were:The viewsThe kayakingThe surprising cave I was thinking on the way back, all of these things you would get regardless of the price or tour operator. Therefore when spending more you would expect better food, better service and better activities. I was disappointed with all of these things. 1- foodThe first meal was lunch, and if you don't like seafood your wont eat, simple as that. We were asked if there was anything we didn't eat prior, and we said no. However I would expect some variety (chicken, beef etc) so that we could choose. Especially paying $80 for 24 hours on the boat. The other meals did have some better variety with meat, but breakfast was shocking. Bread and eggs, that was it. $80 and that's what they serve for breakfast?Coffee is included, but that's it. You have to pay for water (I absolutely despise places that charge for water, no human being should ever have to pay for water- but that's another problem for another time) you also have to pay for juice. You also have to pay for beers etc, and they are expensive! 2- serviceTi, our tour guide was friendly enough and his English was also good. However I didn't feel like any of the other crew members were welcoming. No hellos or how are you etc. Again $80 per person, I would expect decent service! They wouldn't go out of their way for anything, and their attitude was very much like it or lump it. 3- activitiesSurprising cave was cool, as was kayaking (although this was only for 40 minutes)However as mentioned above you get these two included with ANY cruise, even the cheapest ones. Other activities included were spring roll making, this took 5 minutes before dinner, although it was fun, and squid fishing, again good fun but that was due to us tourists turning it into a competition between countries!On the final day, we had two options (or so we were told) sunbathe for two hours or visit a pearl farm. At NO point did we receive a choice, we were taken to a beach and were allowed to stay here for 40 minutes, before being ushered back onto the boat. When I questioned our tour guide his response was we haven't got enough time, even though everyone arrived for breakfast on time and left the beach on time. The second day really is a waste, and they just try and keep you occupied until 10, when you have to vacate the cabin, and wait on the top deck until you arrive back at the mainland to go home. Overall I was very disappointed. I feel like we spent the extra money and received nothing extra for it. The company was called Papaya. We were also told to LIE about the price we paid if asked, as apparently we were paying considerably less due to booking through Indochina travel!I feel very very sorry if any of our fellow travellers paid much more than us!!"

We used Adventure Indichina Travel for booking all of our activities while staying in the Northern part of Vietnam and were very satisfied with the service we received. We used them to buy guided trips, but also to arrange our own trips, for which they were very helpful, although they did not always make a profit from it. This left us with the feeling that they had a genuine interest in making our trip memorable, and not only to sell us the most trips in order to make the largest profit.Since we had taken the lazy approach and only had done a minimum of research before arriving to Hanoi, it was a great help for us to have Paul give us advice on what to see and more importantly HOW to see it. Instead of only selling us guided trips, which often would not have suited us, he also helped us plan our own trips by using his local contacts \u2013 for example by arranging a cheap homestay in Sapa with a local family he knew.While planning our trips, we also experienced a service level above and beyond the usual. Paul offered us to save our luggage in his own apartment, and Ms Giang helped us find very cheap and local transportation to Ninh Binh, although it required an additional effort from her, since she had to stay in daily contact with the transportation company, to make sure they picked us up at the right locations. On top of that, she even used her free time to meet us at the station to make sure we went into the right minivan. Since our driver did not speak English, and we did not know where to find him, this service was highly appreciated.So thank you Adventure Indochina Travel for making our trip in Vietnam memorable!Best regards from Peter and Daniel."

We were fortunate enough to meet Paul on our Halong Bay trip, as he was there to make sure what he and his team signed guest up for, they were receiving. You would think other agencies do that, but I've never been on a trip where I've actually met someone following through.Anyway, we started talking with him and he told us he worked for a travel agency. So we did what others would do and started asking him about our Sapa trip we wanted to take. My husband had a pretty good ideas on the schedule we wanted to do, so we asked Paul. He was so gracious in giving us information and advice on what we should do and how long, but never pushy to book with his agency. He even told us before we book, we need to do our research on his company. We looked at Trip Advisor and after reading reviews, we knew that we needed to book with Paul and we are SO GLAD we did!We not only got to work with Paul (who is by the way, one of the nicest people we met on our month trip), Hai and Anna. Being a foreigner in a place where everything is unfamiliar, Hai met us at our hotel to make payments, Anna met us at our hotel took us to the train station and walked us to out train cart and room. They even met us at our train cart to pick us up on our return from Sapa. All three definitely set the bar on what service should be like. Also, the other companies they work with have fantastic people! Our guide in Sapa, Aihn (pronounced I-an) was AMAZING!Our trip ended and we were on our way to Cambodia and ended up booking with Paul again for Seim Reap. Again, our guide in Seim Reap was fantastic too!If you are looking to book a day trip, a boat cruise or anything, you NEED to contact this agency. I promise you will not regret it!"

We are all aged between 25-30 and wanted to go on a trip with a similar age group. The transfers were included in air conditioned buses to and from Hanoi and the bay (around 3.5 hours drive). We met other young and likeminded travellers at the bay, and checked in on our 3 deck boat. The cabins were very clean and well sized, each 2 or 3 person room had an en-suite toilet and shower, which is helpful. Plus you could lock the cabins if you were leaving anything valuable in there.We experienced some great food (included), and got to cruise in 2 man kayaks for a good couple of hours, going around the islets in a fantastic private setting. The view is incredible, I would definitely recommend taking a go-pro or other type of waterproof camera. Back on the boat, we were allowed to jump off the boat, and swim around (daytime only). The top deck was really cool - table football, seats, a few sun loungers, and lots of space for everyone on board.You can buy beers and cocktails on the boat, it was 30,000 VND for a can of beer, so not too bad, considering everything else was included. We had a lot of fun meeting the other people, and partying until the early hours on the boat! There was even a second boat with more people on, which was connected to ours so that it made a larger group (24 people on our boat, 7 on the second boat).I really enjoyed the cooking demonstration on making Vietnamese Spring rolls, whilst we sailed back to shore. The crew were really friendly and did a great job.Everything went very smoothly and I'm really impressed with Indochina and thankful for all their help and advice when we enquired about booking. They showed us photos of how it would look, and it all checked out. It was a fantastic tour, and I really was blown away by the scenery. Wish we had the time to stay there for another night! Thanks to all for a brilliant time."

So Indochina may have got a third party commission of some sort.I paid 52 USD.Verdict: Huge waste of time.Summary: It takes about 2-3 hours to get to the destination, you start with the 2 king temples in Tam Coc I believe. Walk around. It was poorly organized with tons of groups also looking at the temples. Scenery was nice.Back on to the bus, then you go for lunch. Lunch was surprisingly a good buffet.In Hoa Loa, you hop on a mini canoe, 3 to a person. The lady/male guide, takes you to the end, and back. If you tip, she'll only ask for more. That was my experience. She tried lying saying, we needed to pay for the canoe ride; however, that wasn't the case.Expect a ton of other canoes beside you as well. Then you are to take a bike tour around the area. The bikes should be CONDEMNED. They are in terrible condition. Rusty, poor brakes, falling pieces.The pathway you bike is rocky as well. If you are in the older age bracket or have kids, Skip this and stay behind. Don't risk it. The bike ride was stupid. It was dangerous and you couldn't enjoy the scenery because the tour guide was going stupid fast. All in all, waste of money for this trip. Ninh binh is much better spent staying a night locally, and finding a tour guide that takes a small group into the better areas.Indochina/go asia is nothing but leading mice to cheese."

I was visiting Vietnam with a large group of 13 exchange students - we wanted to book a 2 day 1 night cruise to Halong Bay for a reasonable price, since we were all students traveling on a budget. After getting quotes from several different travel agencies in the area, my friend and I visited Adventure Indochina Travel. As young tourists, we were extremely cynical and did not trust anyone (and by this I mean we were looking up reviews of the agency and the cruise on our phones even though our friend, Paul pulled up the identical page on his desktop. I mean, you never know if they created a fake website with good reviews right...?). We were originally pretty set on sailing with Dugong, as they seemingly had the best deal according to the other agencies we visited. However, Paul introduced us to Lemon Cruise, a newer cruise which was basically the same price but had a better itinerary. After much convincing on Paul's part (followed by our interrogation session - sorry Paul!, we decided to book Lemon Cruise with Adventure Indochina. We got the booking with, I believe, the best price compared with other guests on the cruise. The cruise was clean, the itinerary kept us busy (pearl farm, caves, kayaking, squid fishing, brief cooking class, etc.), and the staff was lovely. Definitely a steal for the amount we paid for it. Paul was outstanding - he gave us tips on what to do when we visited Sapa, and invited us back to the office to leave our backpacks while we awaited our overnight train when we returned to Hanoi. He continued to check in on us via Facebook throughout our trip - Paul is really the best!I will definitely recommend this agency to any of my friends who are visiting Hanoi, and will be returning to book with Paul (and his colleague, Anna!) in the near future. Thanks for all your help, Paul and Anna! Thanks to you, we really enjoyed our time in Vietnam."

Paul arranged a 2 day, 1 night trip for me to Halong Bay on the Cristina boat. I cannot fault the trip in any way, the boat was clean and comfortable, the food excellent and the staff were all very friendly, knowledgeable and extremely efficient. I would certainly recommend this excellent value trip and the professional staff at Adventure Indochina. I will use them again when back in Vietnam."

We exchanged money from him at almost international rates and he had funny anecdotes to share."

We used this place to book a trip to Ha Long Bay. He told us we could have gotten a cheaper trip, but it might not have been as trusted. We noticed that others were willing to lower their prices, indicating to us that they may not have been as good as they claimed. Paul's price was firm and I think it paid off. We got a very nice tour of the bay on a trusted boat with a good crew and good food. There was one meal that seemed to lack a bit in quantity though.He also helped us book a bus ticket to travel through the rest of the country."

The bus may have been luxurious but it was very cold and the driver kept putting on the air conditioning which made us even colder. We arrived in Halong bay at about 11am..we stopped for a half hour for a break at a workshop for disabled people. They were carving stone, embroidering pictures and clothes. It was lovely but a little expensive. At Halong bay we were offered tea etc (which we paid for)and asked to wait for our transfer to our boat. On arrival to the boat we were given our cabin keys and the cruise manager went through the safety instructions and gave us our itinerary for the the day, evening and following morning. The cabins were fabulous..warm, clean and beautifully decorated. Food on the cruise was gorgeous. My husband did kayaking while I opted for the boat trip of the islands and fishing villages. The guides were very informative. Staff were amazing.. we had Long, Jason, and Tom Cruise(not THE Tom sadly), to name a few. After dinner we tried squid fishing and caught a few. After a good nights sleep we had breakfast and then there was a trip to a cave. Back to the boat for a buffet style brunch and time to finish packing. We were taken back to shore and then on to our bus for the journey back to Hanoi. We had a great time"

We had flights and hotels already picked out and book when a friend of mine recommended Adventure Indochina Travel Day Tours to help fill in the gaps in our itinerary. We were looking for day trips to the major regional tourist attractions around Vietnam's major cities without it feeling too touristy.The Mekong Delta tour fit the bill. It was a with larger group but still small enough to not feel like we were part of a tourist caravan. The guide was great, had a quirky sense of humor and played a mean guitar (on the bus!). The tour included visits to Ben Tre and My Tho, coconut and honey producing regions respectively. It felt a bit rehearsed, but was a good way to get a glimpse of the local agricultural life. Boat rides through canals and on the river itself were really pleasant and a good way to get some relief from the heat and frenzy of the city. Definitely bring sunscreen and a hat on this trip.Halong Bay tour with Oasis Bay was simply magical. The tour guide was very knowledgable, especially about the local fruit. Once on the boat, slowly motoring through the many islands was something from a dream. Didn't matter that it was cloudy. The fog added mystique. Kayaking in the bay was especially magical. There was also some cave exploration, though it was pretty crowded with other tour groups. The food was good but not spectacular. Accommodations were great. We got a King suite but the bed was clearly two singles pushed together. Balcony was a saving grace. Sauna was a fantastic touch on the boat. On the way in and out, transportation was posh. We stopped at some over priced touristy souvenir shops, as to be expected. Wished we could have stopped along the route in some of the less touristy spots.One big highlight was having all transportation arranged to and from the airports and tours. Communication with this tour company was great.Highly recommend you check these guys out. We'll definitely be seeking their services for our next trip to the region."

Airport pickup was smooth and punctual, and the hotel accommodation arranged for us at the Old Quarters was such a pleasant surprise! We all enjoyed our stay there. Then there were the tours to Sapa, Halong Bay and Tam Coc. The bus journey to these places were rather long and tiring, but the beautiful scenery at these places made it all worthwhile. Our tour guide in Hanoi was Mr Hieu, and we were glad to have him as he was friendly, knowledgeable and always attentive to our needs. Thank you, and hope to have the opportunity to travel to other parts of Vietnam with you in future!"

After doing my own research on Trip Advisor, I came across Adventure Indochina while looking for an agent to help me with creating my itinerary through the North of Vietnam. I wasn't 100% sure on what I wanted to do so was working with a number of agents to help refine the itinerary. Hai and the team at Adventure Indochina were super prompt in responding to my questions and helping me refine my perfect travel agenda. They gave options on hotels to allow me to upgrade to better accommodation options as well as private tour options. When compared to the other responses, Adventure Indochina stood out and thus the trip was booked with them.Our Airport pick up and drop offs went smoothly. Whilst unfortunate, my friend travelling with me got sick on the first day and ended up in hospital. The team at Adventure Indochina were great, they told me to go to the hospital when I called them, they then called the hotel to get them to arrange a taxi so it knew where we needed to go, then arranged for our guide and driver to come check on us and take us back from the hospital once we were done. They then changed our itinerary around to compensate for the lack of mobility we had for the first day and made every effort to make sure we were taken care of for the rest of the trip.We orgnaised for a Street Food Tour in Hanoi, I can not suggest this enough for anyone who's a foodie and loves to try different things.Overall the trip was amazing, the accommodation was fantastic, our included meals were all exceptionally tasty, authentic and as per our requirements. Thank You Hai and the Team at Adventure Indochina. I would most certainly use them again."

I decided to book my family's North Vietnam Tour with Adventure Indochina Travel Day Tours, after reading good reviews of this local agency in TripAdvisor. Totally no regrets at all.Mr Hai was very attentive and informative from the very start, responding promptly via email. He planned and proposed the land tour itinerary based on requirement I provided (like dates, and destination etc) and very accommodating to changes I needed.We had to pay a small deposit for our land tour via One Pay in USD. Mr Hai provided us the link and the transaction was easy.The entire experience was better than expected. All the pick-up, transfers, accommodation was great. We had a 3 hour food tour on foot in Hanoi when we first arrived. Guide was very informative and brought us to try interesting and good street food normally 1st time tourist like us would not have tried. We had the best beef Pho and ended up at a very local caf\u00e9 hang out only local would go. What an experience.Next day, we were transferred to the port for our Ha Long Bay 1 night 2 days cruise. It seems that we had an upgrade to the Royal Wings which was a 5 star cruise that can hold 20+ cabins. Meals on board was also well prepared. Family did kayaking in the bay area, the view was just amazing.After Ha Long Bay, we were transferred to Hanoi train station to take our overnight train to Sapa village. Before we left, Mr Hai came over to greet us at the hotel and gave us a bag of goodies as souvenir (Vietnamese coffee and green bean cake).The agency booked us on a 4 bedded cabin (double deck), comfortable enough to sleep till next morning (if you are not a light sleeper) because the train will stop in a few train stations along the way.Sapa village was interesting. We were book on a 2 day trekking to some villages. We were not lucky with the weather on the 1st day, it rained and that cause the trail to be muddy and wet, which made it dangerous to trek through the trail we were led (on hind sight, very dangerous). We had the women villagers follow us all the way from when we set off from our hotel. Initially, we did not understand why they were following us, but we finally realize that they were there so help hold and guide us through the trail which were had to climb and walk through some difficult hill side paths. At the end of the trail where we ended with our lunch, we had to buy the products the women was selling or just to give them a token as our thanks for their help along the way. The only negative feedback we have is that our guide for the trekking wasn't any good. We just have to keep following him to complete our walk. We would have died if not for the village women. Also, we did not have good view of the village (more due to the weather that day, guess it depends on your luck)We ended our visit to north Vietnam after our night train back from Sapa to Hanoi. We had a transfer arranged to pick us up at the train station and send us to the airport to catch our flight back.Family and I had a great experience, wonderful memories - Thanks Mr Hai and Adventure Indochina Travel"

At Hanoi, places which must be visited are Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum to view his body still laying in state, Ethnology Museum,Water Puppet show at night. Sapa is a totally different place from the hustle and bustle of HanoiThe treks were awesome and we had a wonderful home cooked lunch at Lou Chai Village.The overnight train ride between Hanoi and Sapa is fairly comfortable.Our only blemish on an otherwise great trip was a mediocre lunch we had on the boat cruise to Halong Bay which was our worst meal we had in the entire trip.Our displeasure were lodged with Mr Hai who accepted it as a constructive feedback which more than enough made up for it.Overall I will feel comfortable recommending this agency with special request for Dat, Mai, Hieu as guides and Mike the driver."

They offered a discounted rate in our email exchange (as we booked another tour), but we were undecided until we were in Hanoi and we were happy they still offered the same rate when we chose to push through with the 2nd tour. They don't actually do the tours themselves, but the 2 tours they booked for us (Wati Travel for Halong Bay and APT Travel for Bai Dinh/Trang an) were well organized from pick-up to drop off. I will definitely recommend booking a tour with them. They respond quickly to inquiries and the packages they offer are priced very competitively."

Miss Huong at indochina travel literally saved us so many times.

Could not have done it without her, I highly recommend paying her a visit if your staying in hanoi. You won't regret it! THANKYOU INDOCHINA TRAVEL!!!!!!"

We did not book online but as walk in customers\u2019. Mr. Hai was informative and friendly and did not try to put us under any pressure while advising us on what tours he deemed appropriate for us.We decided on two group tours, a food on foot tour based in Hanoi\u2019s old quarter, and a Halong Bay cruise on board the Paloma cruise Our Old Quarter lunch food on foot tour was a cosmopolitan group tour consisting of five people including ourselves, was an enjoyable introduction to authentic Vietnamese cuisine .We felt spoiled by our guide Anna from the very beginning to the end, with generous portions of fresh delicious dishes .The tour takes place in the old quarter, which is a hive of activity for all street food. We visited 10 different places in total and this experience made us definitely more confident in broadening our food knowledge at street food level. Anna was attentive to all of our groups needs ,and the pace of our tour certainly was not rushed by any means .We would recommend the food on foot tour to anyone wanting to experience real local Vietnamese food.We were very happy with Mr Hai\u2019s recommendation of Paloma Cruise; we could not fault our tour. The boat itself and Halong Bay experience was very well organized, the staff were exceptionally helpful, entertaining, and courteous, food was really good, clean and comfortable air conditioned cabins. The itinerary is varied and enjoyable while not rushed, during the 4 hrs drive from our hotel in Hanoi our host was friendly and kept us entertained but not overly .We cannot recommend our cruise plus our food on foot and of course Adventure Indochina Travel enough."

I made a lot of changes and some quite last minute but was always accommodated quickly with friendly service.We did a customised private trip with Adventure Indochina from Hanoi - Duong Lam - Nghia Lo - Mu Cang Chai - Sapa. There were many highlights including the spectacular rice terraces, homestay and spending time with the local families at Duong Lam and in Nghia Lo. In Duong Lam we walked from the large gate around the ancient village, stopping to explore the hundred-year-old houses, invited to tea with the old (great) grandmothers and learning about their lives and culture. We also visited a few temples with an interesting pagoda and many, many statues of buddha. Nghia Lo was a particular highlight where we homestayed with a local Tai minority family at their beautiful, quaint home made entirely of wood. We had the whole second floor to ourselves (since no one else was staying) with large open shutters and gorgeous views. We were given some free time to explore and wandered down to tranquil plains of rice fields with buffalo, ducks and chickens. Dinner was a laugh when our friendly host insisted we (start and) finish his bottle of homemade rice wine. This was probably also the best meal on our trip.The entire road trip through Mu Cang Chai was spectacular views of rice and tea terraces. However hiking through Sapa gave a better atmosphere amidst the scenery and understanding of the local minorities.All the places we visited were really memorable and I appreciated that we always ate local food. The itinerary was planned well but we missed one meal, some village visits and a waterfall even though we arrived in Sapa 2 hours earlier than the estimated time. The guide was very knowledgeable and had a positive attitude. The driver was very skilled but sometimes he overtook on blind corners which felt quite dangerous. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed our tour very much. Thanks to everyone who made it possible."

I have been travelling in Southeast Asia for a while, and I have to admit, that I was very suspicious of all the travel 'agents', etc. But I have to admit that bus tickets I bought were so much cheaper arranging through Adventure Indochina, the lady in the office was very informative and helpful. Everything went well! thanks"

It was fabulous, we were collected from our Hotel and taken to a variety of little stalls and restaurants. The food was fabulous some was a little strange although all was tasty and edible. One of the highlights for me was being taken down little alleys that I would not have been aware of or game to do. We were looked after very well and the guide spoke fabulous English. I recommend to do this tour early in the trip so you are open to eating street food."

It can get a bit crazy and stressful going around the many tour operators in Hanoi, we just wanted someone to be honest with us. Then we found Paul at Indochina Tours! He made everything so easy and we ended up on the Halong Party Cruise (a bit more party than we were hoping for) and had a fantastic 3 days. The first night was spent on the boat which was anchored in a really beautiful part of the bay, and on the second night we slept on a tiny little private island only shared with a family from the area, a mountain goat and 3 very cute puppies. My friend and I really had a lot of fun on this and Indochina Adventure Tours made the whole thing so easy and enjoyable for us. It becomes hard to trust what people are saying but I really would recommend these people to anyone wanting some honest and reliable information for a great few days at Halong Bay."

It reassured us that he had been a guest on the cruise himself and we felt very reassured that the trip would be everything that we hoped for .

After much consideration and deliberation with numerous travel agencies ranked on TripAdvisor we decided to walk in and try Adventure Indochina Travel.We explained what we wanted and when, we were given clear and definite details of all the tours that we required. Paul and his staff advised us not too book immediately, but to take our time and read through all of the itineraries and information that was provided to us, then come comeback in our own time and discuss in depth what we would like. This was such a comparison to other agencies as they were pushy and trying to tell us to buy there and then, which in my opinion was not a good touch. i felt pressurised when walking into other agencies. We booked Halong Bay with Garden Bay cruise and it certainly lived up to our expectations, friendly staff, knowledgeable guide,meals were to a high standard ,cabins very good and spacious, and really good aircon ,which in the Vietnamese summer period is certainly needed. Itinerary was good without being to rushedWe liked the fact that on day one we sailed to Bai Tu Long Bay and day two to Halong bay.We also booked an evening with private food on foot tour ,this gave us a really good insight into the Old Quarter of Hanoi, we sampled 9 different dishes mostly from local street stalls but 2 were in restaurants ,we enjoyed the variation immensely. Our tour guide Mr Dat suggested that we should not drink egg coffee as we would have trouble sleeping. Instead he said he would meet us at our hotel the following morning and take us for egg coffee.Next morning at exactly 10 am Mr Dat arrived at our hotel and not only took us to amazing authentic Hanoi coffee house but also on a impromptu tour around Hoan Kem lake fantastic service.Thank you so much Mr Dat ,Paul and Ms Huong for this amazing experience I can not thank you enough.We also booked a taxi transfer to airport with Adventure Indochina Travel, Paul was there in person to wish us goodbye and a safe journey which was a fantastic touch in my eyes.Our Halong cruise private food tour plus our taxi were exceedingly cheaper than any of the other agencies we ventured into so I highly recommend this agencies as they go far and beyond to meet your expectations.thank you again to all the amazing people I met on my journey."

(Unfortunately we didn't note his name, but we went on 17 July). We were picked up from our hotel and driven about 3 hours to the marina, stopping at the halfway point to purchase souvenirs and a snack. Our guide had great insight into the culture of Vietnam and it's history, and he was more that willing to answer all our questions. Once embarked, we had the entire boat to ourselves, which was nice, although the boat has more than enough room for 30 people! Lunch was good, alot of food - and our guide was great to point out the various rock formations and offer to take pictures. We stopped at the beach/hike area, and did the hike up to the top (takes about 10-15 minutes of stair climbing). The hike it worth it for some good pictures of the bay. The beach was super crowed, we personally didn't like it, and could have done without it. Overall - great experience, highly recommend."

Mai was a gem and we thoroughly enjoyed our Sapa experience. We called Paul on our way back to Hanoi and asked him to give us his best deal for visiting Halong Bay. He more than pulled through and the next morning we headed off for a wonderful day and night in natures world wonder.

Later that evening we'd a nice dinner and some drinks, played cards and met some great people!! The next morning we had breakfast and set out for the island. The island was amazing. Beautiful views, lovely clear water, good food and more fun with our new friends:) the most memorable part was later that night when we got the chance to swim with plankton it was amazing!! We set off on a trip back to Hanoi the next morning and fitted in a spring roll making class on the way! I'd definitely recommend this tour it was three days very well spent and was good value!!"

If it weren't for what happened on our way back, we would have certainly given 5 stars. A woman from the office came to get us from the hotel to the train, made sure we were in our cabin, and explained everything very clearly and nicely. We got to the hotel In Sapa and had the opportunity to shower and eat breakfast, before going on a light half day walk. The hotel was nice, although dinner was quite mediocre. After that we did a 2 days trek with homestay, which was absolutely one of the best things we did in our time in Vietnam. Great guide, great homestay, great food. After the trek we came back to the hotel and again had the opportunity to shower and eat dinner before going to the night train back. So far everything went excellent.When we got to the train station to go back, it turned out Adventure Indochina booked our tickets for the wrong date! After a very uncertain hour, we finally got replacement tickets, with the help of the local travel agent. The tickets were for an older cabin, and we barley managed to get sleep. When we confronted the office back in Hanoi, we were compensated with only 5usd each.So all in all - we had a good time, but would advise to take caution when booking through this agency."

I send all my friends and family to Paul and Hai because they provide straightforward advice, and even advise against bookings that could make them a profit if they don't think they're suitable for you. The best example of this was when I wanted to book a tour to Sapa. Instead of taking the booking, they simply organised the train tickets and gave me the phone numbers of some local women in Sapa who offer authentic tours. That way all the money goes directly to the women. This to me speaks volumes about how socially responsible Indochina Adventure are at a time when other agencies are trying to milk every last dong out of their customers. Can't recommend them enough!"

But the sights were great. After that we took a little row boat (rowed by a local) down the Red River. The scenery here were amazing.

Paul's responses were always quick, very informative and contained useful travel advice. Upon arriving at our Hostel in Hanoi, we met up with Paul instantly as his travel agency is conveniently located within the popular Old Quarter. The girls and I walked into his shop at which point he sat us down, provided us with candy and presented us with a rundown of our upcoming activities as per my Facebook requests. Our travel plans consisted of the following: a day bus to and from Sa Pa, Trekking with Shu Shu along with a one night homestay as well as a 2 day 1 night Ha Long Bay Party Cruise. Paul provided us with a cellphone to contact Shu Shu upon our arrival in Sa Pa which helped tremendously with the overwhelming amount of women approaching you. He made all of our bookings so effortless and we loved all of our adventures.I would highly recommend booking any sort of travel plans you might have with Paul and the lovely ladies who work alongside him at Adventure Indochina in Hanoi.

Paul is really honest and offers great advice, having lived in Vietnam for 8 years. I guess that means he knows what he's talking about! He also goes on a lot of the tours and trips himself regularly to check them out himself, so you know you can trust his opinion. Really friendly agency and I plan to book other trips with them during my travels around SE Asia."

From beginning to end, Paul and the rest of the gang made the experience seamless, going as far as to provide us with a phone to use while we were in Sa Pa.

In particular Anna who we dealt with was extremely helpful, she did everything to make the trip just perfect and when we nearly missed our night bus to Sapa she stayed way beyond closing hours to make sure we got to our trip safely! she tailored everything to our need specifically!! The trip to Sapa was breathe taking and our English speaking guide gave us great nuggets of information along the trek! The family homestay was a very authentic experience, and I would highly recommend it! the service was so good with adventure indochina travel that we organised further tours for the rest of our stay in vietnam! A great find and we saved a bundle by booking with them and not our hostel that we were staying in!"

The tour we went on was excellent, with great food and accommodation. We got it for a cheaper price than many other places offer. Paul also walked us up the street and showed us all of the best places to eat in Hanoi which was very helpful. He goes above and beyond for all of his clients. We were so pleased with our tour that we got Paul to book us a tour of Sapa. He organised everything for us. We got a bus up. He provided us with a mobile phone to contact Sho Sho who was going to be our guide. We also did a home stay at her house as well as 1.5 days trekking with her. She had very good English and was a pleasure to be around. She dressed us up in traditional clothing. We planted rice with her family in the fields and she gave us a lot of rice wine that night. It was very entertaining. We really got to see what life is like for her and her family. We got back and booked our airport transfer with Paul. It was only $10 for two of us which was very good since the meter came to almost double that when we arrived at the airport. We would highly recommend Paul and the other staff at Indochina. You won't be disappointed if you book with them! They made our stay in Hanoi the best it could possible be."

The service that I recieved was excellent, there was no hard selling and the advice they gave me was real and honest. As a solo traveller it was important to me that I met other people especially around my age group. They showed me pictures of what I should expect and even looked up the weather for me to help me decide when would be best to go! When I returned from my trip I was so happy I also booked 3 nights 2 day tour in Sapa with a member of staff called Anna. She was extremely helpful and so polite, I was made to feel as ease and very very happy with the service I have recieved from indochina. I would reccomend them to everyone!Thankyou"

We were referred to Paul by a friend, I facebook messaged him just asking a few questions and he replied right away with different trip options and directions for us. In hanoi when we met up, we sat with Paul and his staff and talked, they were so friendly we felt like old friends. There was no pressure to buy anything. We just sat down and told Paul our dates and what we wanted. We looked around and we definately got the best deal with Indochina travel. The cruise was exactly what I wanted. We did 3 days 2 nights, I left feeling very happy! We met some amazing people, made new friends, the staff on the boat were great, and the food was delicious! It was a fun atmosphere on the boat but not obnoxiously crazy party. Another thing I loved about Paul was that after we booked our tour he showed us where to get good Vietnamese food, walked us there and ordered a Hanoi dish (which we loved). And the many times we walked by his office he would come out, say hi and point us in the right direction. I would definately recommend this tour for anyone heading out to halong."

Paul gave us the full rundown of boat options in halong bay and then offered a price substantially lower then other agents we talked to. He has personally gone on all the boat trips he offers so knows exactly what to expect for each one and helps you decide which is right for your budget. When he found out we were going to ninh binh he proceeded to spend another 20 minutes giving us recommendations, showed us pictures he took of the various sights in the area, and provided information on the best way to get there.On our way back from halong bay the guide got a phone call and passed us the phone. It was Paul! Calling to make sure everything was OK on our trip. A few days later he chased us down the street to see how our trip to ninh binh was, absolutely above and beyond in every way. Really appreciate everything he did for us. On top of it all he is a very funny and personable guy, great dealing with him. Just head straight here for any travel needs.

Before arriving as a couple in Hanoi, we were a bit unsure of whether we wanted to book an overnight halong bay cruise, after hearing and reading mixed reviews about numerous bad experiences with the different travel agencies. We visited a few agencies who promised us this, that and the other for prices that were surely too good to be true. After shopping around a bit, and feeling even more skeptical, we stumbled across Adventure indochina travels. We walked into this small, simple office, and it didn't take long for us to realize that this was the agency for us. We were presented with a few boat options, as was the same in the other agencies, but it was Paul's (the charismatic dubliner) blunt honesty about each boat, that helped us make the right decision. We chose the 2 day 1 night 'party' cruise, as we were informed that this would probably be most suitable to our age group, rather than the lemon boat cruise, which would be a broader mix of age groups. We were not really looking for a wild party boat, and were assured that this wouldn't be like the infamous 'castaway cruise'. We are happy to say that we made the right choice and the cruise lived up to exactly what was promised.As well as being extremely knowledgable about traveling Vietnam, you immediately get a sense of integrity and that this agency isn't just there to take your money, but rather genuinely to assist you with your trip. We remained in contact with Paul weeks after our brief encounter, and he continued to give us useful advice about our travels over Facebook. Even if you don't end up booking a trip, it is certainly worthwhile stopping by Adventure Indochina travel for some recommendations about Vietnam and, of course, some typical Dublin craic!"

We booked a cruise of Halong Bay through them and had a fantastic time, and the tour was exactly as they had described it to us. Further, when we wanted to skip a city on our open bus pass, they called the company directly and got us a discount. We mentioned needing SIM cards and Trang took one of us on a bike to get them for all of our phones, since there was nowhere within walking distance to go. When we came back from our Halong Bay cruise, Paul followed up with us almost immediately after we got to the hotel to make sure everything was to our liking. Will definitely be recommending them to as many travelers as we can!"

Paul contacted us on Facebook before we even flew into Vietnam and offered to help us out with flights, but it turned out to be cheaper for us to book them ourselves. By the time we got to Hanoi, Paul was expecting us and was waiting for us at the office with a warm smile. He looked at our travel plans and suggested a tour for Halong Bay and the open bus for traveling the rest of the country. Unfortunately, the power was out so we couldnt book anything that night but the next day we came back and Paul gave us a great deal, we got the price of the bus tickets and the tour for the price that the tour normally retails for. Afterwards he went over our itinerary with us to give us recommendations of time to take in each place and what to see, as well as what companies to tour through. I also would like to mention that we were interested in getting a SIM card for my phone and Trang volunteered to take me to where I could buy a preset SIM card because we didn't have a scooter. She got us a great deal (about 4$ CAN for unlimited 3G for a month) and then took me back to the shop. Paul then gave us some good recommendations for where to eat, and what to see in our free day within walking distance of where we were staying Hanoi. The next day we got picked up very promptly in front of our hotel and the tour around Halong Bay was wonderful, very beautiful and fun. Paul recommended a great company. On the boat we met a few other Canadians who decided to join us on our bus so we came back into the shop to get them tickets as well and Trang recognized us, checked up on our SIM cards and seemed genuinely sad to see us go. Paul also checked in with us within 15 mins of getting into the hotel room after we got back from Halong Bay, he also double checked that we had gotten what we needed from Trang in the way of bus tickets. A+ service, he never pushed anything on us and was happy to help no matter what we needed from him, and whether he was making money or not. Only recommendation is take cash with you, if you pay by credit they have to charge you a 3% service charge."

Not only that, he showed us his personal pictures of the boat and his experiences with it. Meaning, he knew what he was talking about. He then asked what we wanted to do after Halong Bay. We told him we were thinking about Ninh Binh. Without hesitation he gave us a map and showed us more pictures from his personal experience. He didn't try to sell us anything. He was just happy to help and hoped that we would enjoy Vietnam as much as he does. After our Halong trip, we walked past his shop on the way to find something to eat. When we walked past him in the office, he ran after us just to say hi and see how everything went. In a country that one can get ripped off very easily, he is trustworthy...

In the initial planning stages of our trip, Mr. Hai was very responsive and helpful in accommodating our wishes and preferences via email. With his help, we ended up planning an itinerary with 2 nights in Saigon, 1 night in Can Tho, 1 night in Hoi An, 2 nights in Hanoi, and 1 night in Halong Bay. Overall, we had a wonderful time on our trip and very much enjoyed the itinerary that was planned for us.Highlights:- Our tour guide in Saigon, Thang, was truly excellent and easily one of the best parts of our trip. He obviously was very well organized and really went out of his way to make sure we were having a good time. He was not only very knowledgeable and willing to share his insight on life in Vietnam but also extremely considerate and fun to be around.- Our two-day Halong Bay expedition with Alova Gold Cruise was enjoyable. The crew was friendly and went out of their way to make our trip fun. We thought two days in Halong Bay was a perfect amount of time.- Our two days exploring the Mekong Delta was another highlight of our trip. We greatly enjoyed tasting the fruit from a small boat vendor as well as visiting a local market and Cai Rang.- The two hotels we specifically requested in Saigon (Liberty Central) and Hanoi (Golden Sun Palace) were excellent.- Overall the restaurants that we ate at tended to be more upscale (i.e. don't expect street food) with solid Vietnamese food.- We very much enjoyed our tour of the Ancient Town in Hoi An.Cons:- While Thang truly went above and beyond, our tour guides in Hoi An and Hanoi were only average. One dropped us off at the airport 5 hours early, while the other would often tell us to explore sites on our own while he would wait nearby. In addition, we didn\u2019t see a few sites that I had specifically requested for our itinerary in each city.- A few of our hotels were not as clean as we would\u2019ve liked.In general, for the price point of the tour package, we were impressed by the level of service and fantastic organization that Adventure Indochina provided. There were only a few minor errors along the way, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this company to others."

From the first e-mail, through our departure meeting, everything was above board and professional. Their planning and effort made our quick 6 days in Hanoi into a trip of a lifetime.First, the planning. Their website was great and allowed me to get a good handle on options for our 6 days. Once contacted by e-mail, Hai was absolutely fantastic in providing options and alternatives. He always replied to e-mails the day he received them and never hesitated to answer all questions and concerns we had. Even when I found a better rated Halong Bay Cruise (Indochina Junk - Red Dragon . . Awesome!!!), and asked to switch it out with our original booking, Hai made the change and got us switched with no hassle. The deposit payment through the internet went through with no problem and all prices and requirements were as explained.In Hanoi, our name was held up by our driver as we exited customs at the airport and we were on the bus in less than 5 minutes. The driver was very nice and we got our first experience with Hanoi traffic on the drive to the hotel.Hai actually met us at the Classic Street Hotel and we could not have been happier (I have reviewed it as well on Trip Advisor). Hai reviewed the entire itinerary and asked if we had any questions. It was great to put a face to a name. Classic Street is a fantastic hotel that my wife and I were thrilled to have stayed at. The place is clean, close to Hiem Kein lake and right smack in the middle of the Old Quarter. We had a window in each of the two rooms and both were great.Our tours. CHOOSE PRIVATE. Especially in a small group, the cost is minimal for such a more rewarding experience. Our first Street Foods Tour was a great welcome to Hanoi and the Old Quarter. Kat, our manager from the Classic Street was very personable and did a wonderful job of showing us around the neighborhood. The food was amazing (none of us got sick) and was just an amazing experience. Kat kept trying to stop for more and we just couldn't eat anymore. THANKS KAT!!Our second tour, 'Village Tour' with Ling was one of our favorites. Ling spoke perfect English and with the private tour you get your own van and driver. We had an blast getting out of the middle of Hanoi and experiencing the countryside and getting to talk to Ling. The first village was just cultural and very interesting, the next two were the ceramic and silk, both good. She also took us to another street foods restaurant for lunch which was very good! You must try the Egg Coffee as well, THANKS LING!!!!!The one tour that we almost switched from Group to private was the only slight disappointment. Spend the extra money and keep all your tours private. The guides are fantastic, and the personal attention and interactions make the entire experience. This was our Hanoi city tour and it happened to be on the hottest day (96 F). The van was stuffed pretty tight and the group tour must stick to the itinerary. We spent an hour just picking people up as well, though it was nice to see the rest of Hanoi outside the Old Quarter. It was wonderful to see the Temple of Literature, Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum, along with a couple other stops, but it just would have been better better private, that's all.HALONG (Bai Tu Long ) BAY with Indochina Junk (Red Dragon) - AMAZING. An air conditioned, limousine style van picked us up, and I made wifi calls back home on our drive through the countryside . . . surreal! We did upgrade this as mentioned before, but Hai had no problems getting it done. Well worth the extra $150 per person. The Red Dragon only had 5 cabins, a max of 11 people and was in great shape. The staff (Mr. T our guide and Kai our bartender) were top notch, This trip goes to the quieter and less crowded Bai Tu Long Bay. The cabins and bathrooms were very clean as were all the public spaces. The food was ridiculously good and every meal had 5-6 courses. The floating village, the private beach, the cave and the ships make the Indochina Junk experience truly once in a lifetime experience.One quick note which tells you how good of a guy Hai is. We misunderstood about packing up our room at Classic Street for the one night on the boat. So on our way to Halong we got a call saying they needed our rooms. We told them to charge us the $30 nightly rate and we would deal with it when we got back. Hai met us our last day, apologized for not being more clear and paid the $30 each for our two rooms. He did not need to, or have to, but he made it right!!! I also called and scheduled a last minute trip to the Hanoi Hilton \"Hoa Lo Prison\" . Our guide 'Anthony' was perfect!!! He was so personable and very informative. It was great as a history teacher to be able to talk to a local and discuss the amazing transformation Vietnam has seen during his lifetime (his first half before 1994 and the new Vietnam since). Hai and Indochina Adventure made this happen with less than 24hrs. notice and it was a great bookend for our trip.The best part - When Hai met us the last day and took care of that extra hotel charge, he asked us what could be done better. We honestly did not have much of anything to say. We did mention how happy we were with him helping us out with the room charge and suggested mentioning on their website how many people will be on certain 'group' tours. He wrote everything down and was genuinely interested. This was our first trip to Asia and a bit of a gamble, but my wife said it best when we left \"It was perfect!!\"Thank you so much Hai!!"

From the food tour (Thanks Cat!)to the cruise on the Red Dragon in Ha Long bay (Best regards to Mr T and Cai), it couldn't have been better. Mr. Hai was attentive and kind and very informative through out the trip. There was a misunderstanding at one point on our part and Mr Hai went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. He understands customer service and we would recommend this company and use them again in a heart beat! Our hotel recommendation for the Classic Street Hotel was fantastically located in the heart of Hanoi. We were also grateful for our knowledgeable local tour guides Ling and Anthony!"

We are disappointed that they sold us expensive train tickets ($280 USD for a cabin, round-trip) when a cheaper and quicker option of travel is by sleeper bus on a brand-new highway to Sapa.Furthermore, we found their cancellation policy unreasonable, as they wanted to charge 80% for a cancellation > 48 hours prior to our return.I would not recommend this company."

I found this company through reviews on tripadvisor and decided to give them a shot at helping to design a 15 day tour of Vietnam and Cambodia. I have just returned from the trip so thought I would offer my experiences.I set out a rough itinery by looking at various tour packages for the region. I chose the following trips - Sapa, Halong Bay, Hanoi, Hoi An, Siagon (with city tour and trip to tunnels), Mecon Delta, Phonn Penn and Siem Reap. adventure Indochina offered me various options for the trip and also various price points. In the end I booked some of the hotels but AI booked all pick ups from the airports, transfers to hotels, internal flights, booked day trips and overnight train to Sapa and also overnight on Junk and private tours in Phonn Penn and Siem Reap. The cost was around $1000 per head - which was significantly cheaper than going through a tour operator in England,We paid various deposits to Mr Hai at the company and he was very helpful and communicated immediately in helping to put the package together.So our experiences. On arrival in Hanoi there was some one to meet us and take us to the hotel. Mr Hai was there waiting and he went through the itinary with us and ran through the pick up times and arrangements for the next couple of weeks. He also gave us an individual emergency number should there be any problems.We were looked after very well by the company. Everything they had booked went well - there were a few minor hiccups that they resolved immediately (tour company they booked in Siagon put us on a half day trip rather than full - Mr Hai sorted and got them to taxi us to connect with the right tour, and in Chau Doc there was a mix up with pick ups from the hotel so he got the hotel speed boat taking us to Phonn Penn to wait for us). So a full on tour, an experience not to be missed - highlights were Sapa walking in the mountains, tunnels and war museum, Hoi An (couple of suits made and beautiful hotel), Mecon Delta and Siem Reap. We packed a lot in but it was worth every penny and AI looked after us very well."

This was the first time that I ever used a travel company and didn't book everything on my own and I am sure glad I did. When we stepped off the plane after our 30 hour travel day, we were met with a smiling face, bottled water and a great driver. All of our guides spoke very good English, went above and beyond and our trip went smoothly with no issues. Everything was planned out for us and nothing was overlooked. While planning for the trip we made several changes and these were always addressed immediately. As far as the hotel recommendations we chose to stay in 3 star accommodations and they were all clean, comfortable beds and included great buffet breakfasts. My parents are planning a trip to Vietnam at the end of this year and I am insisting that they go with Adventure Indochina. While I am always nervous about not being in control of everything on my vacation, I can say with confidence that using this company takes the stress and unknowns off my plate for my vacation. After the first day or two of them proving they had everything under control, I was able to sit back, relax and enjoy the trip. One final nice touch was the Mr. Hai came to our hotel on our last day to ask for feedback on our trip, hotels and meals. He even gave us a little souvenir gift. While this was not necessary, it was a great touch and shows the level of customer service that you will get from them. They are local and do not advertise, but please do not let that deter you! Great company, Great Service and Highly Recommended from a high maintenance traveler!!"

Based on very positive tripadvisor reviews I had called into Adventure Indochine Travel to help me with a trip to Sapa and to Ha Long Bay. I arrived at Hanoi Airport at 3pm and made my way to the Old Quarter. I explained my request to Ms Huang and with a few pointed questions she understood, what I was looking for and presented a few options. She offered great advise based on experience. Within 30 min the trips where booked. It was all inclusive: pickup from hotel, transport (train and bus), accomodation, food, tour with tour guide and telefone number for a hotline in case any of the arrangements are not working out as planned.At 8pm the same day !!! I started my trip to Sapa followed by a trip to Ha Long Bay. Everything worked exactly as planned and when I compared prices with other people on the tours, that had booked either from home or through other channels, I had by far the best deal. On return I went back to the office to thank them for the great time I had. Paul explained to me the secrect: First he has been in Hanoi for many years and understands the environment. And second, probably more importantly, he goes to tours on offer himself where possible, to learn about the operators and the local specfics, so he can offer honest and experience based advise to his customers. Last not least, the people in the office are so friendly. You get the best smiles in town, when you enter their office."

There is no pressure to book through them but they offer great prices (considerably cheaper than booking through your hotel) as they have such a good relationship with various tour operators. They even show you the margins they make, there is complete honesty and transparency. I booked multiple trips with them including a great trip to Mai Chau, and a wonderful tour on Halong Bay where we got a 5 star boat for 2/3 star prices.

While every agent was prompt, the ultimate deciding factor was the ease of itinerary changes and costs which we got from them.We booked a full 12 day package with them from South towards North with flights, trains, tours most meals, everything. Almost all tour operators ultimately outsource tours to other companies and don't conduct entire tour themselves. We were thus told to plan our tours on our own. However we found going to Indochina made our entire trip smooth and left us free to enjoy the beauty that is Vietnam. In the entire tour we found everything perfectly organize, whenever we landed in a city we found our cabs waiting promptly irrespective of flight delays.On many group tours we had awesome meals. Please note we were just specified Lunch- but they did not cur corners anywhere and we had multiple course lunches everyday.Whats better all individual tours were updated of our dietary restrictions.Even after we booked the trip Mr. Hai was very prompt with all queries on email. There were many times during the trip that we needed to contact them for the details of subsequent day logistics. each time the reply was prompt and polite ( once even replied at 4 am!) Some standout things that were arranged for us: For a 3 hour halt between Sapa and Halong Bay we got a hotel to rest; baggage on each domestic flight, a cake arranged for my wife, good spacing between tours and free time.I am really hard pressed to find any sore point and will recommend Hai to anyone travelling to Vietnam."

We stumpled upon this travel agency and we were immidiatly satisfied with the prices for a bus to hue (5 dollar cheaper Than What they asked at 'friends travel agency'). The owner Paul really wants you to have the normal prices and the best tours. He actually went with us on the food tour because he likes going on these tours and check if they are good. The food tour was really amazing. We had 13 dishes in Total and they were al really good and in local places Where you would not come as a normal tourist. Mr. Cat explained everything very Well. Overall we were really happy with the tour and we would def recommend it. Also if you want to book other tours or bus tickets, go to this place! Paul is really the kind of person that wants to give you the best experience for the least amount of money! Thank you so Much! "

            "review": "Flexible and convenient. We were 4 French people and had two different tours planned with the agency with a French tour guide. The first one was in the Mekong Delta, the program was nice but slightly pushy, we had no time to take a break and just enjoy the area, but I guess they just wanted to keep us busy. Also we had way too much to eat (like western people eat all the time) and the last 2 restaurants were strictly tourist-oriented which was not very nice. We would have loved to be able to choose the kind of food we wanted and have some more time to chit-chat. The guide never spends the meals with us, we were a little weirded out cause we would have been happy to share some informal conversations with him. That's for the small negatives, otherwise the trip was smooth and convenient since we had nothing to worry about. We discovered the area with lots of useful information and had a great time !The second tour was a 4 days trip to Ninh Binh and Halong bay. There were small things to improve like the driving ... we did not feel safe although we know that they drive in a really different way than the one we know. Also we asked if it was possible to stay in Nam Dinh which is not touristy at all and the agency arranged it for us, but they never mentioned that the hotel situation was really bad and we had the worst night ever which local tourists screaming until 2 am and throwing beer cans to our balcony to show they were not happy to be told to make less noise. This was not the responsibility of the agency but they are here to give us advice on that ! Anyway outside of that, the tour was awesome, we decided to pick the restaurants ourselves and it was perfect. The tour to Halong bay starting from Cat Ba Island was the best time we had in Vietnam. We had a boat to ourselves and got buy fresh caught crabs for lunch we loved it ! I would definitely recommend the agency for small tours, 2-4 days was ideal for us. Make sure to check the weather before booking your trip as winter is not ideal for the north part of Vietnam. Indochina travel is trustworthy and reliable so I would not hesitate to book with them again, and I would know now to check the details with them before and lighten the program if it is possible !"

Everything was perfectly organised from our arrival in Hanoi, our 5 day trip to the North, the boat trip in Bai Tu Long Bay to the tour in Hanoi itself. The highlight was certainly the 5 days in Ha Giang, Quan Ba, Dong Van, Meo Vac and Quan Ba. This is the mountainous northern region, close to the border with China. We had chosen this tour because it is less touristic than the region of Sapa and we were not dissapointed - beautiful landscape, firendly people in colourful traditional clothes, great food. Exactly what we had been looking for. Of course we could only enjoy all this, because we had our fabulous guide Dat and our very responsible driver. Dat is not only the guide, he is also an artist, a cook, a storyteller and much more. We can highly recommend him for your trip! And if you can, book the homestays - people there are very warm and welcoming and you will learn a lot about their culture. We will never forget our dinners with the families. One thing is inevitable on this trip though: there is a lot of driving, many times on narrow roads up in the mountains. Dat made sure though that we got our \"hiking time\", even if it was on the road with breathtaking views into the green valleys."

When choosing a tour provider for both of these places, we heard that you must be wary, as there are many scams and bad experiences. However, we received a recommendation from a diplomat friend who lives in the country and has had great experiences with Adventure Indochina.We're glad we chose them! At Halong Bay we had a very nice two-day, one-night experience on the Christina cruise. What magnificent views that region has. You can see that unfortunately the bay is becoming a bit commercialized and Disney-like, but honestly none of that takes away from its sheer beauty. The staff on the Christina cruise were great, as were the rooms, and we really had a nice experience there. I think we enjoyed the kayaking portion most, though honestly it was interesting to see how pearls are grown as well.Sa Pa was one of the true highlights of our monthlong trip in Vietnam. We went with the two-star hotel option and stayed at Summit, which was fine. There, we had two days worth of tours \u2013\u00a0one day to Cat Cat and the second to Lai Chau and Tavan. The tours, which were led by our Hmong guide, Mang, were authentic and interesting. We also took a third day to ourselves in Sa Pa \u2013\u00a0highly recommended!! \u2013\u00a0and trekked to and from Ta Phin village alone.... Though you're never truly alone in Sa Pa, because there are always village ladies following you to sell souvenirs!To and from Sa Pa, we took the new express sleeping bus that uses the highway that opened in September. Generally it was an OK experience, but herein lies our only complaint. In both directions, toward the end of the bus ride, the drivers just parked the bus and went to sleep for an hour without alerting anyone what was going on. They also picked up various local passengers along the way, giving them off-the-books tickets and also saving them the best seats! None of this would have been all that problematic, except we had a flight to catch from Hanoi on the way back. There came Hai, of Adventure Indochina, to the rescue. We were about 20 minutes outside of Hanoi, and the bus driver pulled over the bus to take his unexplained hour snooze. We did not know what to do, because we needed to get to the airport, and the bus was already running late.. presumably due to its various added stops to pick up local hitchhikers. We called Hai, and we woke up the bus driver. The bus driver shook himself awake and quickly restarted the bus, but we realized we would still not be on time for the airport, if we took the local airport bus as planned. While the whole situation was clearly not the fault of Adventure Indochina \u2013\u00a0the bus company is not associated with a particular tour agency and is the one that they basically all must use \u2013\u00a0Hai jumped to make everything better for us.He offered to split the cost of a private taxi with us. He immediately wired the money to the hotel at our next destination, in Hue! Thank you, Hai! You made our Sa Pa trip remain a great experience, and we would recommend using them as your tour organizer in Vietnam!"

Our guide, Mr Dat, spoke good English and was very informative about the area. We really enjoyed the boat trip. We were rowed through 6 caves. The lunch we had consisted of goat meat, lots of herbs and vegetables, it was tasty!! Anywhere we wanted to stop to take photos was not a problem at all. On arriving back in Hanoi we decided to book a food on foot tour for lunch the following day. This was a group tour, not private. We were happy out! Ms Tuyet, our guide, was very informative and took us to local food stalls we would have not found if we went around by ourselves. She also explained to us in some detail both the history of the old quarter and its customs. We had 8 meals excluding the famous Cafe Truong. To say we were full would be an understatement!! Food was delicious, yum yum :) We certainly would have no hesitation in recommending Adventure Indochina Travel to friends and anyone visiting Hanoi"

We stumbled across indochina travel agents while shopping around for prices to Sapa and Halong Bay. We met Paul a fellow Irish man. Through meeting Paul we booked our halong bay trip which seemed much cheaper than some of the others and we also booked SAPA which I believe we got a great price on as on our trip we met 2 people that where charged twice the price for the exact same tour. Paul wasn't just of help for these tours but also made us feel at ease in a new country offering us advise and recommendations for the other areas we were visiting. I highly recommend booking with Indochina tours. Halong Bay and Sapa will be hard to beat amongst our travels. The buses to both journeys were seamless and accommodation perfect.Halong bay we stayed one night on the boat with our own room this was extremely clean and food was great. We made some great friends on this trip. We also stayed another on a private island which was pure paradise and can't make any complaints.Our Sapa trip was also perfect and in my opinion the best price I have seen for a good standard tour. The night bus was overcrowded on the way back but still comfortable and completely out of our travel agents control as the bus serves to many different companies.The tour company made sure we enjoyed both our trips and arrived safely. Paul has kept in touch to ensure my stay in Vietnam is that of a pleasant one. I found the travel agents very personal and comfortable they allowed us to print off our flight tickets for our next destination and keep our bags here for a while also. I believe this company go above and beyond for their customers and genuinely care."

We arranged the taxi pick up from arrival which was quite helpful and reasonably priced. We then met with Paul and he proceeded to take us through our best options for Hanoi and the tours available. We opted for the Halong Bay tour and the Sapa and Bac Ha tour. We found the Halong Bay tour to be perfect for what we were looking for and Paul really took the time to help choose the right kind of tour for us, and even told us not to take the more expensive option. The best advice we received however was the home-stay in Sapa which was a truly unique and one-off experience. We stayed with ShuShu and her family and it was definitely a highlight of our whole trip. We later found out from other travellers that this was a very reasonably priced and authentic tour in comparison to their 'homestays', which included internet and heating! We continued onto Bac Ha to see the markets which was a lot of travelling and perhaps only advisable if you have more time.Another really valuable aspect was Paul taking us out on a walking tour of Hanoi showing us where is good to go and the best prices to pay. This was a real insight from one of the 'locals' and we were so grateful.Overall, we could not recommend Paul any more for anybody travelling out in Vietnam. He and his team offer a wealth of information on all aspects, including the middle and the south of the country. They are always happy to spend time with you and even helped us with booking additional flights after a last minute change in our plans.Highly recommended! Rachel and Vim"

Thank you Paul and your staff for our tour and we hope to see you again in the future!!!"

Some people in Hanoi stongly recommended me to go to Adventure Indochina Travel if i wanted to have a great trip for a very good price. I have to say, all the great reviews on Tripadvisor are true. The tour was amazing; the food, the boat, the crew, the island were all great. People who also booked the Halong Bay tour were all around my age which was very nice. Other than the tour itself, Paul and the staff of Adventure Indochina Travel were more than friendly and gave me lots of advice on other things i could do in Vietnam/ South East Asia. I strongly recommend anyone who visits Hanoi to stop by their office. Thanks again Paul & staff. cheers, B."

We asked around, read TA reviews and finally ended up here. And I'm so glad we did! We gave Paul our timeframe and an idea of what kinds of things we'd like to do in Vietnam. He helped us to put up an great itinerary, especially lunch food tour was just awesome! Paul himself joined us for the lunch tour and we had memorable few hours in Hanoi old quarters. Paul even took pictures for us and sent them afterwards.After Hanoi we went to Hue and Hoi An. In Hoi An we stayed in a homestay Paul had recommended and one day he called us there to check if everything was ok - this is what you can call customer service!Do yourself a favor and let these guys help you with your visit to Vietnam. I'm sure you won't be disappointed."

I have travelled Asia extensively, and come across similar travel and tour businesses like this one, but this one stands out in my mind as the best. Paul the owner is a friendly, down to Earth, fellow Irish man, and he goes above and beyond for customer service. He truly cares not only about delivering a top quality service (which he does), but takes an honest interest in all the travellers that pass through his doors. We booked 3 tours with this company, we had one little problem in Halong Bay (unrelated to the booking agency, more down to our naive ways in a foreign country) one call to Paul, and everything was sorted within 20 mins (this is a 24 hr service!!). Though the shop is small, it is easy to find, especially if you give a taxi the address. I recommend all new arrivals in Hanoi to make this your first port of call. Paul is your gateway to Northern Vietnam, and local encyclopaedia of free helpful advice. It's doubtful I'll be back to Hanoi for many years, but I hope Paul is still there if I ever do, and will tell all my friends to go see him if they ever drop in to Hanoi."

The agency was close by from where I was eating on hang Buom St in the old district. It was my very first day in Vietnam and I wanted to figure out what I would like to do during my stay and since I didn't have much time, I wanted to make sure I would make the best out of my stay in Vietnam and that I would be able to get a great value for my money.I knew what I wanted to do and the very helpful staff at Indochina Travel helped me build my itinerary with the best rate possible without compromising too much on quality.Thanks to Snow, Lan Huong, Tran Hai and Paul for their precious help and advices. Each time I had a question, or wanted to modify things on my up-coming trip I could write them an email and get an answer back in only few minutes. Everybody at the agency was always very helpful and patient.I booked the overnight train to Sapa and a 3 days trek there including homestay and one night at Panaroma hotel. I really recommend that trip. Sapa is absolutely gorgeous especially if you get to have a clear blue sky! The Panaroma hotel staff is really great and the rooms are nice and clean. I had a balcony with a beautiful view of the mountains. Maya was our trekking guide and I was with a group of 7 people (I recommend 8 people groups maximum, its better). Maya's English was very good and she was fun and very knowledgeable, we learned a lot during the treck with her.I also book a 1 night stay in Halong Bay on Lemon cruise. Everybody recommended to stay at least 2 nights but I couldn't as I was flying to Hoi an on the other day.So everything went smoothly during my stay in Vietnam thanks to Indochina travel staff.I really recommend this agency for your trips booking in Vietnam!"

We found Adventure Indochina on tripadvisor and asked to customize a day trip to Halong Bay for us - we wanted a private car to ease the long drive from Hanoi to Halong Bay and back, but we wanted to join a group tour to keep the cost down. The tour was fairly well organised - and the private car and driver were very good. The staff on the boat was friendly and willing to accommodate food requests. But the food was quite average, and it would have been nice if they had tables for 2 people instead of us having to share a table with strangers. The 2 other areas for improvement were:1. There were only 6 chairs on the top deck while there were 30 people - more chairs would have been nice.2. When kayaking we were asked to help ourselves to life jackets from this massive pile of jackets. Most of them had missing buckles and several of them were quite smelly. On the whole though, it was a good trip and not nearly as expensive as some of the other options."

            "review": "We Were Going Wrong Til Indochina Put Us On The Straight And Narrow. I happened to hear about Paul and Indochina Travel in my local gym in Ireland when a guy overheard I was going to Vietnam for my vacation. He gave me Pauls card and told me to contact him when we got to Hanoi. We only had two weeks in Vietnam so we were trying to see as much as possible. The first week we were basically travelling Ho Chi Minh, Mekong Delta, a quick trip into Cambodia to see Angkor Wat and when we arrived in Hanoi we were zonked from travelling and trying to pack too much in.When we met Paul in Indochinas office he was blown away by what we'd covered in our first week and was quite taken aback when we told him we wanted to go to Sapa, Halong Bay and be in Hoi An in three days!! After talking to Paul he told us that while we could fit everything in we probably would end up being back in Ireland wrecked and in need of another holiday to recover from this one!! So on Paul's advice we decided to drop Sapa and save it for our next trip. Instead we opted for, on Paul's recommendation another night in Hanoi in the fantastic welcoming 3B Hotel where the staff were absolutely amazing. It's just up the street from Indochina. Paul hand wrote us an itinerary of things to see in Hanoi the following day and he reccommended the restaurant A New Day, again just up the street for dinner. It was so good we went twice! Paul booked us a tour with the help of his lovely aid Chang to Halong Bay with Lemon Cruises which included pick up from our hotel and transport to Halong City. From there we toured Halong Bay in our junk boat, visited a cave, kayaked, swam and climbed to the top of one of the islets. We had a fantastic meal on the boat with the other guests and had a lovely evening and later we tried our hands at squid fishing. Alas we didn't catch anything for breakfast! But it was great fun trying to snag the squids as they toyed with our lines. We retired to our cute romantic cabin for what was a very restful sleep listening to the the waters of Halong Bay lap against our boat. Next morning after a scrummy breakfast we went to visit an Oyster farm in the bay and we got to learn all about oysters and how pearls are made. We then got our transfer onto another boat where we cruised all the way through Halong Bay into Lang Ha Bay. Our guide brought us on a bike tour through Cat Ba Island National Park and into a tiny little farm village where we saw water buffalo and farmers at work in the fields. The scenery was breathtaking. After another scrummy lunch on the boat we were transferred to one of the tiny islands off Cat Ba where we stayed in a beach hut in what could only be described as paradise. We rented kayaks for the day and went off exploring all the surrounding tiny islets and found some tiny remote beaches where you really thought you were the only people on the planet. We had a fantastic meal in the restaurant at the beach that night and slept like logs again in our beach hut. The next day we were transferred back to Hanoi where we picked up our bags in our hotel. They even let us shower which was really nice of them. Paul's assistant Chang had booked us an overnight train to Danang which is an experience everyone should take in Vietnam. And from there we went to Hoi An and chilled out for the rest of our holiday.So all in all I couldn't reccommend Paul and Indochina travel high enough. All meals were included in our tour except drinks. The itinerary that Paul gave us was spot on and punctual. And he checked in on us every few days on facebook to see how we were getting on. Even when our tour was finished!! :) Thanks again and we'll be back, this time to book a trip to Sapa Paul and a few stops in between! :) :) Thanks Fran and Laoise."

Because of this we had a look around Hanoi and came across this gem of a travel agent. We ended up booking a trip to Halong Bay and Sapa with them and were not disappointed. The tours were good and the prices were better than what others paid on our tours. What we especially liked was the fact that at Indochina they had a list with all Halong Bay tours with the prices so you would know exactly what tour you would get at what price. They also made no issue about us wanting to have a think about it while many other agents will tell you that if you don't book soon it might be sold out etc. If you're looking to book a tour look no further I would say and go to Indochina."

Little things like buying water at a cheap place before going, exchanging my money properly, and finding a place to drink coffee to wait for my Halong bay tour on the morning I would return from Sapa.As if that wasn't enough, booking tours with my friends with Paul later felt natural and the guy was an incredible help.

Mr Hai and Ms Huong thank you so much My friend and myself booked 3 separate tours with Adventure Indochina Travel and had great and unique experiences on all of the tours recommended to us by Mr Hai And Ms HuongWe travelled To Halong Bay on a day tour (with Alova Day Cruise). Unfortunately we did not have enough time in Hanoi for an overnight cruise. Although it was a long day it was extremely enjoyable with great views. I would definitely recommend a visit.We had also booked a private tour to Bai Dinh Trang An, visiting an amazing temple complex and also six caves with fantastic scenery. While being rowed on a small sampan our guide for the day Mr Tung was extremely informative and spoke perfect English.Finally we went on a food on food lunch tour. Not only were the dishes we sampled delicious, our guide Ms Huong, a native of Hanoi was able to take us to places we would never have found ourselves but also gave us a detailed explanation of the history of Hanoi City and it\u2019s architectureWe would definitely recommend Adventure Indochina Travel for their excellent and friendly service. They also provided us with information after we had left Hanoi. Thanks again and I hope I see you again."

We ended up spending the next hour planning our entire trip in Vietnam with their informative and helpful staff. The staff were not just trying to sell us tours and other things we didn't want It was good honest advice about the do's and dont's of Vietnam to suit our time scale and budget. We ended up booking flights, taxis, accommodation and a Halong Bay tour. The Halong bay tour was one of the highlights of our trip, the boat was clean and comfortable and the staff were excellent on board. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food we were served. I couldn't recommend Adventure Indochina Travel to anyone traveling to Hanoi you wont regret it."

I booked a trip to Halong Bay with my father who was visiting. It was absolutly amazing, they provided special vegetarian food for my father which he said was delicious. The tour guide was funny, patient and very informative throughout the cave tour and the kayaking. The views of Halong are something out of this world, reaching the top of one of the islands was breath taking not just from all the stairs. The most beatiful view ive ever seen. Theres a very big reason why it is such a tourist attraction. I fully reccomend making this part of your trip.With such fair prices and excellent customer services Adventure Indochina Travels is the place to book."

It can be hard to decide but if you do your homework it's a no brainer! We found Adventure Indochina after hearing great things about them from other travellers whilst travelling through Vietnam. Their office is easy to find and in the heart of the old quarter. We walked in and were greeted by Paul who instantly made us feel welcome and was open for a chat a laugh and keen to help out. Many times when you go to book something it's all about when where and how much money a company can make out of you but it's completely different here. They are interested in you as people and that makes a nice change. We booked a tour to Halong Bay with Papaya on Paul's advice and we couldn't have been happier. The boat was lovely the food was great and the staff were top quality. We loved the trip so much that when we got back we went to see Paul and asked if he could organise a food tour for us that evening. At such short notice we weren't too sure but he managed to pull it out the bag and Ms.Huong gave us an insight to Vietnamese food we would never have had without her & the best Pho Bo in Hanoi! I cannot recommend this company enough they are so keen to help out and can't do enough for you. All of the staff are friendly and speak great English and it was a refreshing sight to come across an agency that were different. We'll be back to Vietnam soon and when we do this will be our first stop!"

The shop is very easy to find on the corner of Hang Buom and Dao Duy Tu and is open early til late. Mr Hai suggested various different options for our trip and was able to give us excellent advice that tailored to our needs. He recommended the Monkey Island Cruise which was a perfect choice for us as it meant we had a private balcony attached to our room and included all the activities we hoped to do such as swimming, kayaking, visiting caves and trying the local seafood.On the trip itself, we had a wonderful time as the crew were very hospitable and the food was fantastic. All of this was organised for us in very little time which was mainly due to the excellent service we had received from Adventure Indochina Travel."

Not only will she recommend great travel plans in your budget, she will also help you with absolutely anything - you just need to ask :). ***Highly recommend the services of 'Adventure Indochina Travel Day Tours' for stress free travel experiences in Vietnam.P.S: I also arranged for airport pickup and drop facility from them, and it was seamless and at a great price."

He was really interested in our feedback afterwards. You can't find the cheapest tours here, but you will get an awesome tour. You'll probably want to avoid the cheaper ones. So afterwards when we went back to book the open bus ticket Paul gave us also a lot of tips for restaurants, activities and sightseeing in the rest of Vietnam and also with getting the right simcard and even our laundry, everything was just out of kindness.All together we would definitely recommend this place!"

Paul was so informative and knowledgeable about all the trips and took time to explain which tours were major scams and which tours were worth it. It felt like you were talking to a friend rather than a travel agent because not once did he push us to book anything, just wanted us to be informed. IN FACT, for Sapa he called a local woman that he is friends with who lived in one of the villages and set up for us to do a homestay with her. Her name was Mama shu and it was amazzzing trekking for 4 hours to her village in the beautiful mountains and then staying a night on her humble farm. The great thing was that we paid Mama shu directly and indochina travel made no profit...they just wanted us to have a great time and it really felt like that while we were chatting and dealing with them.

I got a really good deal for less than a lot of other agents were quoting which consisted of a two night cruise to Ha Long Bay on a Papaya boat. The other people on the cruise were a healthy balance of young and middle age, backpackers and holiday makers. Paul and Jo explained beforehand what to expect for the price I was paying and it was pretty much spot on. The weather wasn't great on the second morning but Ha Long is a costal port so it's to be expected. Overall for the price I paid I was pleased with the deal and given the fantastic level of customer service from Paul and his team I would certainly recommend them to anybody else. I even booked an overnight bus through them to Hue after the cruise and got a better price than I was quoted elsewhere."

As our (2 adults and 10 year old daughter) first trip out of the heady but amazing madness of Hanoi, we were looking forward to relative tranquility and authenticity... and we got them both in spades.Although late picking us up (by 45 mins) and experiencing a small altercation with traffic police (no idea why - standard stop and check on papers etc), and quite a trek out of Hanoi with requisite drinks/food break half way through the 4 hour journey, we weren't at all disappointed on arrival at the home stay village Adventure Indochina had arranged.Our guide Twan was a delight...taking care to make sure our daughter was OK and interacted really well speaking good English. He led us on a bike ride through rice paddies, seeing traditional weavers at work on old looms in stilted house villages (although much of the product on sale is mass produced now of course), providing insightful commentary on the way of life past and present in the valley. To our daughter's delight, our bamboo lodge for the one night stay was located right in front of rice paddies in a wonderful part of the valley.After an eventful night's sleep (big storm!) we awoke to a sunny day and Twan led us on a great walk to the local market, and then up several hundred steps to a lovely surprise in a limestone cavern with stalactites and stalagmites in abundance (although some have been damaged by people living there). Food was really good, well organised and friendly hosts, lovely part of Vietnam well worth the visit before it disappears 100% disappears to homestay tourism. Highly recommend is company ... And ask for Twan !"

We were looking to book tours outside of our more expensive hostel and looked towards Adventure Indochina thanks to their already fantastic reviews on here. It is a decision we do not regret as we ended up booking two tours with them.Our first tour was to Sapa and it is hard to find faults with anything this tour offered. However the destination hotel failed to pick us up from our bus with our large travelling backpacks meaning we had to walk around a kilometre to our hotel, and those of you who know Sapa will know that it is not flat! I will say though that this is definitely NOT the fault of the tour company and I will highlight that the company is always on the look out for different services to make the experience better and appreciates the feedback. After this positive experience we decided to book another tour to Halong Bay with them. At no point did we feel pressured to go through with purchasing as we were recommended to check the weather first to make sure our tour was as enjoyable as possible. Once again this tour went without a hitch and we are very glad we went with this company.In conclusion I would recommend this company 100% as it is an environment where you don't feel pressured to buy and the services offered are first rate. If you can talk to Paul I would recommend it. A thoroughly decent bloke who is happy to help with any queries and advice you need. Many thanks!"

I found Adventure Indochina via Trip Advisor and contacted them by email about six weeks before my holiday with a list of various trips that I wanted to do, for example 3 nights 2 days in Sapa, 1 night 2 day cruise Halong Bay, walking tour of Hoi An, visit to My Son, and others. I also asked them to arrange all my airport transfers and Visa On Arrival - I never like the idea of trying to figure out the local public transport upon arrival at a new destination.Ms Huong picked up my enquiry (she is based in the HCMC office) and she was excellent, she made suggestions about which trips would be better and how to fit everything in, how to save money, etc. It was a very personal service and she emailed me throughout my holiday to check that everything was going well, she even emailed me when I got back to the UK to check that I'd arrived back home safely - I thought this was a really lovely gesture.I also visited the Adventure Indochina office in Hanoi where Mr Hai and Paul were really friendly and welcoming. Mr Hai even gave me a lift to the Vietnam Airlines office on the back of his motorbike when I wanted to change an internal flight.I arranged my flights and hotels myself, but everything I did within Vietnam was arranged via this tour operator and from that point of view I was a good customer - and in return I received a level of service that I thought was excellent. I've never used a tour operator in this way before, but it worked really well. There is no way I could have afforded to do this holiday via an organisation like Trailfinders or Exodus, I was aware that I paid less for my trips than other people were. I would definitely recommend Adventure Indochina - if I come back to visit southern Vietnam I\u2019ll definitely contact Ms Huong."

We were greeted by this very friendly team and sat down to begin discussing our plans to head north in Vietnam. Our main booking was done by Paul, hilarious, and very knowledgeable and friendly, but we were assisted in other ways by all of the staff within the business. We were given many options and chose a soft sleeper over night train to Sa Pa with a stay at a resort of our picking (we still think perhaps we should have stayed at the recommended resort but enjoyed our stay none the less). We also discussed trips to HaLong Bay and Paul was very honest about the weather in the area and didnt try to sway us in any direction. He even sent us on our trip to Sa Pa with a list of options and tours for Halong, stating that if we decided to go we could just email him our preference and he would do his best to book it for us. They allowed us pick up at their store and to store our bags there between hotel check out and tour pick up, and sent the sweetest young lady with us to the train station to ensure we got there safely and right onto the train and to our bunks. Top Notch Service! The tour in Sa Pa was wonderful (food was good and the treks were with a fun bunch of travellers), we decided against Halong this trip due to intense fog, but Paul was still very friendly and helpful upon our arrival back in Hanoi after our tour was complete. They even went so far as to rush us into a cab they ordered as we had a flight to catch and misjudged the travel time to the airport.I would recommend this company to ANY travellers in Hanoi and would not hesitate to use them again in future. The benefit of their expertise and friendly advice spoiled us and made planning other trips along the country seem more difficult. Thank you Paul!!"

They offered us Alova Gold Cruise (the actual tour was perfectly fine). We decided to prebook our trip since we didn't have too many days in the Hanoi area. So we paid a small deposit online to keep a place for us on a particular day. When we arrived into Hanoi a few days before the cruise day we went into their office. They were absoluetely uninterested in answering ANY questions and just wanted the remainder amount that was due. The day we had pre decided seemed a little 'iffy' as far as the weather was concerned so we wanted to get them to check the weather and see if we could change our booking and go on a different day. Mr Hai was assigned to us who very reluctantly showed us some alternatives and gave us evasive answers. We turned our attention to Paul who was only interested in selling a trip to a bunch of 3 caucasian girls...provided them with minute details of each and every aspect of their trip planning. And here we were his actual customers asking him if we should postpone our trip by a day or two and all we got is a shrug. Moral of the story is do not part with your money until you are absolutely sure of your itinerary and ideally be in Hanoi when you book. We could have booked directly thru Alova Gold and really didn't need this unhelpful broker."

They gave me honest, genuine advice which helped me decide on the right trip for me. At no point did I ever feel under pressure to make a decision or even to book a tour. In terms of price, I did \"shop around\" and I found that the prices offered at Adventure Indochina were extremely competitive. As for the tours themselves, I was very happy. They lived up to the descriptions we`d heard and the pictures we`d seen back at the office.I also booked an onwards bus ticket through Mr Hai at Adventure Indochina as I trusted them to get me the best price ticket and didn`t feel the need to go elsewhere.Finally, it`s also worth noting that Paul gave me lots of advice about how to go about getting a visa for China. This was something that he didn`t have to do and there was nothing in it for him, but it was a great help to me. In a nutshell, Adventure Indochina offers high quality tours at competitive prices, while consistenly providing a friendly, honest service."

After reading the reviews and sitting down with Paul to book a trip to Halong Bay we felt comfortable with the decision we made, however this was very wrong. Paul painted a picture of the tour that was very different to the one which we received. Once on the Boat we made our way to Halong bay, the weather was awful, which is no ones fault but we could have been informed that is was a bad time of year to go. Due to the weather we couldn't see any of the bay. We were promised rock climbing however we were told that we couldn't do this as the tide at this time of year is too low - something else we should have been informed about. We visited a cave which was overcrowded with other tourists and were rushed through the cave by the guide. We then went kayaking, again we were given an unrealistic time schedule of 30 minutes, by the time we got in the kayak and made our way to the first rock it was time to come back. Once we got back on the boat for the night we were promised an authentic meal - this consisted of rice and chips with some meat. The cabins were ok but we had not hot water as stated. The next day we headed for an island to spend the day/night, once we got there we were told we could go swimming - along with the rain the beach was full of rubbish, polystyrene chunks and even needles! We were told that we would be close to cat ba island, thinking that we may be able to head there for a visit we were told it was too far away and had to spend the next 24 hours on a 200m strip of beach in the rain with nothing to do - no squid fishing, snorkelling, karaoke or drinking games as said on the itinerary . Next day we finally made our way back to the harbour, the cooking class given on the way back consisted of putting some meat into a pancake. Once we arrived back at the harbour we were told to wait on the side of the road for 2 hours, we were then told the bus was full so had to ask another tour bus to take us back. Overall Paul seemed a nice informative guy but completely mislead us and got our hopes up, he also should of informed us about the weather. Really disappointing."

It sounded great, showing pictures of a sunny party cruise through beautiful scenery.. What Paul failed to inform us was that as it was winter in the area the trip would be nothing like the one pictured. There was no swimming on the white sandy beach, climbing to the Titop Peak to enjoy the view and the rock climbing was inaccessible due to the low tides. The visibility was very poor due to the fog and rain, it was also pretty cold. The itinerary mentioned squid fishing equipment- we guessed that we might be able to do some fishing but this never occurred. On the private beach it was very dirty with needles in the sand, rubbish in the water and polystyrene floating at the waters edge.. Idealic scenery but unfortunately ruined. There was also very little to do on the island so we all sat around and watched tv or used internet. The itinerary mentioned squid fishing equipment- we guessed that we might be able to do some fishing but this never occurred. As we were near to Cat Ba a lot of us wished we could have gone there for the evening for something to do- this could be an improvement for future. The meals consisted of chips, rice, some pretty plain satays and fish- I wouldn't exactly describe it as authentic cuisine.. After arriving back at the harbour the return bus was full- not ideal when we had a bus already booked to pass on to Hoi An. Don't get me wrong, Paul was helpful and he can't change the weather..

            "review": "First agency I have trusted. My girlfriend and I have been all over the show about a Halong Bay trip. After reading reviews we couldnt decide to do it at all, a one day, or multiple. Because of weather and time we decided on a day trip but then it was a matter of finding an agent who would make the trip reasonably priced and run smoothly...in stepped Paul.Paul was honest, frank about everything, and got us the best deal we had seen compared to other places. I can honestly say it was the first time I brought package rather than be sold one. They dont hide the fact that some companies are just flat better than others and sometimes for cheaper.The bus we were transported in was one of the nicest we have been on, not saying its always the case though. It was on time, the guide was professional, and we were back in Hanoi on time.You do stop in each direction at the same rest stop, but buses are apparently required to by the government. The bathrooms are the best ive seen, they even supply toilet paper.The boat itself was nothing special, with an inside area and upper observation deck, but the lunch surpassed my expectations. Warning: beers are 40,000 and sodas are 30,000 not free despite how they are presented. Lunch included rice, tofu, fried egg, whole grilled fish, cabbage, and fried spring rolls and its shared between tables of 6. Veggie only options are available and the menu may change.The boat takes you to a floating village where you can kayake or bamboo boat. If you want to do one book in advance. Advance is like $2/person on site it is $6/person and not worth the increase in my opinion.From the floating village the boat takes everyone to the cave. This cave is massive but in my opinion the potential grandeur has been completely ruined by the tacky colored lights used to splash green, blue, pink on the walls, the \"cascades\" and \"guisers\" created by pumps, and the silly stories by the guide about formations in the cave. Most of my review has been about explaining what to expect on the tour, but this company wont hide any info from you and made the experience the best it could be everything considered. Best value for money by far."

Paul - one of the travel agents- also showed us the best places to eat and drink around Hanoi and we were very grateful for that!I recommend this travel agent's to those who want the best quality service in Hanoi.

He also gave us contact details of a Vietnamese family to do it with. This was an amazing first hand experience of Vietnamese culture and by far one of the highlights of our trip. Upon return from Sapa, we visited Paul again not only to reflect on our past few days but to book a bus for the remainder of our journey through Vietnam. This was done efficiently with a smile and everything we needed to know about the journey clearly explained. I must add that Paul is also a really funny guy and i found myself laughing constantly while in the Adventure Indochina office. Great Staff. Great Service."

I only wished we had organised our entire 2 week Vietnam holiday with them as hotel rates through them would have also been cheaper. We travelled from Saigon through to Nha Trang, Halong Bay, Hanoi and 3 day trekking in/around Sapa via Lao Cai. They could have handled the entire booking and best of all, payment can be made credit card without even having to be there!"

It has certainly been a holiday for us as all the logistics were sorted out by Hai, who even remembered my birthday and arranged for flowers to be delivered. I have been recommending him to everyone. Do not be put off by the fact it is all planned- most of the attractions are way out there and by the time you figure out how to get there, half of the day is gone.

Because we are quite satisfied by what we paid and what we had, I'm writing this review as my thanks for Mr. Hai who runs Adventure Indochina Travel. He clearly showed us what's included and (more importantly) what\u2019s NOT, of which some tourists didn't be informed by their agency well in advance. Some of them even paid much more than us and they took slow trains, which seems less comfy, for both directions. We really dealt with a correct travel agency. We also booked a taxi to the airport here. What picked us up was an unexpected brand new, well-sized Toyota van which send us to the faraway destination within 45 mins by satisfactorily safe driving. Awesome!"

However we had nothing to worry about once we found Adventure Indochina. We booked a trip to Halong Bay where the team helped us decide what would be the best option for what we were looking for - the trip was amazing which lead to us going back to sort out more of our travels with the team. They organised flights (even found out the aircraft type as I am a nervous flyer) and internal transfers for us and the team kept in touch with us for the duration our stay to make sure that everything was going to plan and they came to our hotel to see us off on the final day and to wish us well.

We dealt with Paul and he was great to deal with and took everything into consideration when organising our trip. He never forced a sale on us and was straight with pricing and information. We booked Halong bay and he told us to just book the Sapa bus without the tour. Most places would force a tour on you but he felt sorting the tour in person by ourselves in sapa would be better, and he was right. Halong bay trip was exactly as he describe and a lovely experience but his advice on sapa was priceless. It was the best experience I had in my whole time in south east Asia. Paul really goes above and beyond to help out his customers before and after a sale and I'd recommend anyone travelling through Vietnam to call in for advice or to book tours with Paul because you will get trustworthy and honest info."

We would wholeheartedly recommend this company to anyone/ everyone.As beginner travelers (and a group of 3 inexperienced girls!) we were worried we may be ripped off when we went to book excursions/ flights. Once we found this little shop on the main strip (Ma Mai) however, we knew we were in safe hands.The company owner- a man called Paul- ensured we got the best deals on each flight/ train/ bus journey even suggesting other times of travel to make sure we got the cheapest price. The fact he was English speaking made communication a lot easier, as it was often difficult to convey ideas to local travel agents, and there was a lot of misunderstanding.Even when all the local hostels were fully booked, Paul himself made a few calls and personally took us from place to place to find somewhere to stay for the night- an added service he did not have to do at all. Along with this, Paul and his team remained in touch with us throughout our trip and ensured we got through plenty of disasters (from our luggage not arriving at the airport to our luggage being stolen!) Initially we thought that booking flights and excursions in a foreign country would be difficult and a little stressful. However, the whole team at Adventure Indochina, especially Paul, made the whole thing so easy for us. They gave us the best rates and the best level of service.We would 100% go and book there again and recommend all our family and friends to do the same!Thank you once again Adventure Indochina, for making out trip even more wonderful!!!"

I was told about Adventure Indochina from a friendly couple I met in my hostel.I went to their office and was greeted by Paul (the friendly Irish owner). Paul sat me down and asked me what type of trip I was looking for exactly.I just wanted a relaxed trip to HaLong bay and Sapa. Paul told me exactly what was included and I can say it was exactly as he described it to me. Had an amazing time in both HaLong bay and Sapa. Sleeping in the boat in HaLong bay and walk throughout the hills in Sapa.I would highly recommend Adventure Indochina to anyone traveling to Hanoi."

That's when we first met Paul the chatty Man Utd fan from Ireland. After talking all things Man Utd with us Paul started to take us through all the options available to us for our Ha Long Bay trip of which there are many choices. With there being so many choices it was good to have Paul's advice here and he helped us pick the perfect choice for our budget.The tour was amazing and more than we hoped for. The boat we stayed on was comfortable, the staff were great and the food was good too. We have some great memories of that trip and we wouldn't have changed a thing!We were so happy with our Ha Long Bay trip that when we got back to Hanoi we decided to use the guys again to help us with transportation for the rest of our trip in Vietnam. Paul and Miss Huong sorted us out with overnight sleeper train tickets from Hanoi to Hue then Hue to Danang. We were also able to book internal flights from Danang to HMC.Paul also gave us some great (free) advice about the best way for us to get from Vietnam to cambodia based on how much time we had left.Overall these guys were a great help to us and should we ever rock up in Hanoi again we would definitely look to them again to help us with our travel plans!So my advice to anyone who takes the time to read this review would be to drop by Adventure Indochina Travel and take the stress out of booking your travel and concentrate on having the time of your life in an amazing country!We had such an amazing time and a small but important part of that was down to the help, advice and staff at Adventure Indochina Travel!A big thank you!Daniel and Lucy from Yorkshire"

They will tell you exactly what to expect on a tour and will give you a price range for budget to upmarket so that you can make a considered choice. We are a family with two teenagers and Paul and Hai have hit the mark every time on what will work well for us and what to avoid.We have also recommended them to friends who were visiting and each time our friends have walked away raving about the price, service and of course the great adventure. They even booked a two week long private tour of Northern Vietnam for one friend who had a brilliant time. Paul and Hai go to great lengths to make sure that you enjoy your trip, even giving you a hotline to call if anything happens on the tour (luckily the trips are so good that we haven't had to use it, but it is Vietnam...so it is good to know you have it).We are living in Hanoi for a year and Paul and Hai have an excellent reputation here amongst the ex-pats. We just went to SaPa with them and had a fantastic time and we will continue to use them until we leave Vietnam. They are definitely the best tour agency in Hanoi, if not Vietnam."

The irish guy (Paul if I remember well) that we dealt with in the office was really nice and was advicing us one of their trips to Tam Coc because of the value quality-money. Maybe that was the main reason why we were really disappointed with the result.The guide we had was horrible. He was just looking forward to go back to Hanoi since the point we left Hanoi. We spent more time than usual in both breaks we did in both ways, in totally meaningless souvenir shops. He was not aware at all about the schedule of the trip that it was provided to us in the travel agency. Thanks that we had the paper with us, we were able to ask him to follow more or less it. In Hoa Lu we spent less than one hour and of course we didnt even go up to the hill which is adviced everywhere to have a look of all the area. Once we finished the boat trip in Tam Coc he was pushing us to go back to the bus to go back to Hanoi. Thanks that we had the schedule printed, we didnt accept to go into the bus before the time agreed. Conclusion ==> I dont do 5-6 hours bus for spending just 1 hour in a boat. The purpose of going to Tam Coc it was to see the whole area, and spend some time there. If I wanna go back early to Hanoi I just dont go to Tam Coc and stay the whole day in Hanoi :)So to summarize, if they dont change the people they hire this trip with, I would never recommend this trip with Adventure Indochina. It was by far, the worst trip we had in Vietnam, even the area is one of most beautiful in Vietnam."

            "review": "By far the most honest and competitively priced Tour companies in Hanoi. Arriving in Hanoi was a little over whelming at first. I was clueless as to what to do with my time there. After spending several stressful days there(self inflicted mostly from Bia Hoi's) a friend recommended to stop by and have a chat with these guys. I was greeted by a welcoming staff member who sat me down and listened to my story and travel plans. He gave me a number of options which I went away and slept on. Between the tour to Sapa and Ha Long Bay I was torn between both but opted for the trip to Ha Long. I took a notion to book it on short notice. The staff made this very easy for me and even took my laundry which I needed ready for the morning. I was up at the crack of dawn the next day and went to collect my laundry and was then collected by the bus. We made our way to Ha Long bay. The bus was comfy and the tour guide was good. His English may have been better but you got the gist. When we arrived we got on the boat and the tour really began. We started with some Kayaking and explored a cave. We then went to a really beautiful island with a great view from the top of the hill of the Bay. After a nice swim we got back on the boat and prepared for dinner. The food was exquisite and we had a veggie, seafood or regular choice of food. I had a bit of them all. After dinner we played some tunes, had some beers and enjoyed the \"craic\" between the rest of the tour goers. I slept well that night and woke quite early in the morn and had the nicest cigarette on the balcony of the room I was in. The sky was pink and the Bay looked unreal. We had a tasty breakfast shortly after and then got ready to do some Cave exploring. This was quite a large cave. If Geology and rock formations are your thing then you will enjoy this. For me this was a nice stroll in a cool area to walk off the beers from the night before. We got back on the boat after taking a few snaps of the area and then made our way back to boat. Not long after we got onto a smaller boat with a nice rooftop. This would take us to the island we were staying on the second night. On the way there we stopped for some rock climbing and swimming which was really cool and good fun. Everyone joined in and made a splash. We had a good hour there and started moving again. I really was gobsmacked when we finally came to the island. Like no place Ive seen before. White sandy beach, green tropical waters, massive cliffs, enclosing the beach to us only. Paradise!!!!Everyone got off the boat and were lost for words. We were given a mixed dorm which I gladly shared with others from the group. They were wooden shacks, very clean and the beds were comfortable. After a fine lunch that day we were left to our own devices. Some sunbathed, some swam or took a rubber ring out to the diving raft a bit out in the water. The 2 kayaks werent long gone from the beach and I opted myself to stay out of the sun and play some pool and table tennis. After time I did all of the above. Kayaking was the highlight as you could go where your arms could get you and back. It was a pretty tiring day and I did have to have a siesta and recharge all around. After sitting on the beach and watching the sunset the shout for dinner arrived. It was a buffet of mixed food which was yet again very tasty. The music that was been played wasnt exactly enjoyable so I changed it myself which the staff or the group did not have any complaints. After dinner the staff lit a fire on the beach. Whilst they sparked it up me and another guy took a kayak out in the darkness to see the plankton that lights up when you paddle through it. An unbelievable sight at night. When we got back the music had been turned up. The fire was ablaze and the staff introduced us to some strange but hilarious drinking games. Some were reluctant to play but I made sure to be in the thick of it. We then moved back to the bar where me an another girl kicked of some karaoke. It took a while and a few songs for more people to get involved but my god I had a pain in my side from laughing after it. That went on for some time and eventually the tunes came back on again and we all just socialised for the rest of the night. A great night overall.The next morn was an early start but a bit painful after all the drinks. Breakfast was a struggle but did the trick as I knew we had a bit of a boat trip ahead. I packed my stuff, got back on the boat and gladly sprawled out on the boat taking in the views of the wonderful scenery around me. It was so chilled that morning. Peaceful and relaxing. Eventually we linked up with the boat we stayed on the first night. We had a cooking class where we made some spring rolls. Lunch was served a while after and now the trip was coming to the end. We got off the boat, back on the bus and back to Hanoi.It was a great experience overall. Make sure this is the first tour company to stop by when visiting Hanoi. Great Tour Selection, Honest Service, Best Prices & Friendly Staff."

On return from Sapa I returned without hesitation to these guys to arrange my open tour bus ticket and Halong bay tour. Again the open tour ticket was cheaper that others I had spoken with and having returned from my trip I can confirm that there was no compromise on quality either. I had heard many horror stories about the night buses but whatever company Indochina book were clean and bug- free! Myself and a few friends booked a Halong bay tour also. Paul laid out all the options and gave extremely honest reviews of each. The tour we chose was affordable and even better than Paul had described. We were very very happy with the service and recommended it to anyone we met on our travels. Paul also kindly gave us recommendations for other places to visit on our travels even in Cambodia.

Adventure Indochina, and the tour company I booked through them, recommended a hospital, arranged transport there, accompanied me en route (three hours by taxi), and then stayed until two am to negotiate hospital fees, translate and settle me in. During my week stay in hospital they visited each day to ensure I was recovering ok and help with anything they could. By *far* the best company I came across while travelling.

Anyone who has been to Hanoi will know the bewildering array of travel agencies and variety of options & prices on offer, with the possibility of picking a less than satisfactory tour quite high.After pounding the pavement checking prices, we went to Adventure Indochina to see Paul and Lee. My immediate impression was the care and concern they took to sell a quality product and ensure we were informed of exactly what we were buying. Paul gave us a no nonsense chat on the tours he was selling and, refreshingly, informed us that even if we did not choose to book via Adventure Indochina, to come back and see him with details of our chosen tour to make sure it was up to standard & not from a lesser operator. Having a large group with so many options and opinions would normally make coming to an agreement a nightmare, however Adventure Indochina's honest and informed service convinced one and all on contact. From start to finish our Halong Bay trip was excellent, with the tour guides, food, ship and activities exactly as described with perfect locations. Every member of the group had an amazing time and for myself was the highlight of a month long trip up Vietnam. For the very high quality of tour and excellent service we received from Paul, the pricing was a bargain. Other local tour operators could provide cheaper similar tours, but were very sketchy about quality, itineraries and wary of guaranteeing anything, just wanting our money as quickly as possible, something Adventure Indochina were not. Having spoken with many travellers after our trip about their experiences, in some cases nightmarish, we certainly picked the right option and were told so by the vast majority. In addition to our Halong bay trip, Adventure Indochina also helped us with a range of services ranging from travel (coach, taxi and flights) to changing money, the latter excellent advice that they happily gave without profiting from. My taxi ride to the airport was nearly 50% cheaper than my own hostel's travel section could quote. All in all, Adventure Indochina is the best travel operator i've encountered in all my travels. Their dedication to quality and providing the buyer with the best possible experience are second to none. Do check other operators, then go see Paul and Lee for the real story, best tours and local knowledge. You will not be disappointed."

After the boat trip we stay behind in Halong DC Hotel for one night in order to relax from the long distance journey. Mr Hai help us to book the shuttle bus back to the hotel that we stay in Hanoi for only $5 each. He also arrange the transfer back to airport with a very reasonable price. On our last day of the trip, we want to buy some fresh gio lua (Vietnam sauage) as souvenirs back to Hong Kong , but we could not find in a lot of shops. We drop in his office and he suggested us a very good shop to buy the fresh gio lua. All our relatives said our gio lua are very yummy. Thanks to Hai!"

There was 8 person travelling to Sapa via train through this company & Mr Hai gave us exceptional service from the beginning of our trip starting from the first email. They would always reply very quickly to all my questions & were very clear in their response, & once we arrived to Hanoi to catch the train, Mr Hai meet us at our hotel then escorted us all to our train cabins & made sure everything was ok before he left which i have heard not many tour companies offer this service. After our trip he wrote me an email to make sure everything went well & we were happy with our trip & transportation.

It was all a bit daunting because there are so many tours and such varying prices. Our experience of Vietnam is that they will pretty much tell you what you want to hear and when you get there, it's quite different. As soon as we walked into adventure indochina we were greeted with a warm welcome. We explianed that we were pricing around and told them of the information we wanted. We were guided through lots of tours and told of the positive and negative experiences of travellers before us. We were shown photos that previous people had sent back to them so we knew what we were seeing was real. 2 tours for Halong bay were recommended, they were actually cheaper than we were expecting and had a list of unique attractions. We chose the party cruise and it was fantastic! We got everything we were promised plus more. Our Sapa your was equally as good. The service we recieved from adventure indochina was excellent, we used them for some other info for Hanoi and they were more than happy to give us some of their time. We even booked our airport taxi through them as they had the best price in town. Thank you so much for making our final week, and biggest tours the perfection we had hoped for. Keep up the great work."

After few research on tour agents, I found Adventure Indochina in Trip Advisor website fulfilled with positive feedbacks. I inquired regarding the train to Lao Cai, day tour to Bac Ha market, visa on arrival arrangement and other day tours that I was interested. Mr Hai was kindly enough to explain in details on all of my inquiries. He also arranged the visa in which I found very convenience and cheaper than going to the Embassy. After I arrived in Hanoi, I went to the office in Hang Buom street straight away to finalise the payment. Mr Hai once again explained some important points when traveling solo and things to considers when bargaining in the local market. All the trips were successful, leaving me with memorable experiences when traveling to Hanoi, Sapa and Halong Bay. I\u2019m very grateful to find this travel agent and would inquire again when I visit Vietnam in the future. Many thanks Adventure Indochina Travel!"

We were recommended to go see Paul at Adventure Indochina Travel from fellow backpackers who had the pleasure of dealing with him a few weeks before. We were hoping to do a tour of Halong Bay- Paul presented us with many different options, giving us the pros and cons of each tour without trying to push a specific tour on us. Shortly after booking our tour, he received a call from the harbour master that a huge storm was coming in and that no boats would be going out on the water. Paul told us that many companies would still take our money and send us out on the tour but we would arrive and not be allowed out on the boats. We were so fortunate to be dealing with someone as honest as Paul, who saved us a lot of money and disappointment. He recommended other tours for us to do as an alternative and went through all of our options. I can't even explain how wonderful it was to be able to communicate with someone who spoke perfect English. It was really nice to have someone not only provide options, but give us suggestions based on our interests! Paul also gave us suggestions for places to eat and sights to see around Hanoi. An absolute pleasure dealing with Paul and his staff, even though we didn't get to see Halong Bay!"

I booked a trip to Halong Bay, Sapa and Tam Coc in Nimbinh with them, as well as a bus trip to Hue. The prices were all very reasonable, I often found out I paid less than others in my group and I was given detailed itineraries which as a person travelling alone in often hectic Vietnam was really appreciated! I knew a lot more about the trips than others who had booked through other tour operators and had seen photos of what to expect (really helpful at Hanoi Central Train Station when your guide doesn't speak much English and there's mayhem around you!).As mentioned, the team are all extremely helpful. On my first day in Hanoi and feeling slightly overwhelmed and knackered from my bus ride, Paul very kindly pointed out a few local places to me which was so appreciated, keeping my luggage with them when I went off was no bother and they insisted I call back in at any time if there was anything I didn't understand or call them at any point during the trips should a problem arise. It's this kind of service I haven't experienced with other tour operators and why I think you'd be doing yourselves a massive favour to book here as soon as you get here!!"

We wanted to go North on motorbikes and experience the real Vietnam off the tourist trail but neither of us ride. Paul suggested we go by car but we dug in and wanted to experience a sense of freedom by going on the bikes. Mr Hai soon had us organised with 2 guides Huang and Tang (amazing guys ) to do what turned out to be the most breathtakingly amazing if not painful( on the backside) and at sometimes scary trip of our travels so far. Our trip was from Hanoi-Ba Be-Bao Lac-Dong Van via the Meo Vac pass-Ha Giang-Van Lang -Hanoi. Believe everything you read, the scenery is spectacular , the roads are horrendous, the people are fascinating and hardly another tourist in sight.Mr Hai and Paul went out of their way to ensure our trip was the best it could be , and it was the best we have ever done ( 4th Trip to Sth East Asia) when we arrived back they shouted us out for a beer and nibbles and got the run down on our trip, We then booked our trip to Cat Ba with them , Mr Hai is an absolute sweetheart, he picked us up from the hotel, took us to the bus stop and waited with us ( must have thought we were a bit useless),When we arrived back in Hanoi days later and we got off the bus to a sea of taxis and bikes vying for our business, we see the smiling face of Mr Hai come to collect us (very relieved),this was totally unexpected and is service at its absolute best.

When my parents visited Hanoi I took them on a tour of Halong Bay arranged by Paul, Hai and the team. After overcoming the shock of the great price we got, my parents were staggered by the beauty of Halong, as well as the excellent food and service we received on our tour boat.I then booked (at very short notice it should be said) a tour of the Mekong Delta for my family and again the service was second to none. AI took care of absolutely everything and offered by far the lowest price of any operators we sought for a quote. Their friendly service and attention to detail meant we were able to get on with the important stuff: enjoying our holiday.Impressed witht he service, I then used AI again for a Halong Trip with my friends which I can summarise in one word: perfect.Adventure Indochina are the best travel agents I've come across and put the rest of the Hanoi cowboys in the shade. If you're looking to travel out of Hanoi, make sure Adventure Indochina is your first stop."

I had booked some of our tours before with other company. After checking the prices of Adventure Indochina I cancelled the previous tours and decided to book all of my tours in Vietnam with Mr Paul. We got exactly the same trip but much cheaper. The trips were amazing and we couldn't fault anything. We did the Sapa tour which was probably the most amazing thing we've ever done. We also did Halong Bay which was absolutely amazing.If you wnat to be sure everything goes well and you have great expierience at good price including the welcome and support go with those guys!"

Easier said than done, the options are limitless and trying to choose what tour will present you with the best bang for your buck can be extremely exhausting. Adventure Indochina is a gem, I have never in all of my travels found a more helpful and trustworthy booking agency. They give you honest, complete, and reliable information. Paul is absolutely fantastic, not only did he help us with our trip but he looked out for us during the rest of our travels. Emailing us to check in, helping us negotiate buses from afar, and answering all of our questions (even those having nothing to do with Halong bay). It was a wonderful experience booking through them!"

We found ourselves struggling to decide which trip would suit us best as ones friends had first hand experience of were full. We had asked at our hotel and they had been helpful but as their recommendations were also full we found ourselves at a bit of a loss. On walking around the old quarter I saw Paul sitting at a desk and explained to him exactly what we were looking for. After a chat with Mr Hai and Tham, I felt confident they would find something that suited us well. They were very straight forward, no messing about and I liked this approach. They hit the jackpot with their recommendations as we booked through them and followed their suggestion of the Paloma cruise to suit us and it sure did it was great. We received a 5 star service from Adenture Indochina Travel Day Tours. There were no hiccups or problems. We were picked up from our hotel as promised and the cruise was exactly as it had been sold.When we finished the cruise we went back to the office to let them know we had a great time and to thank them, they helped us out again! We needed to get transport to the airport the next day and had been told a taxi would be 18$ or our own research found a shuttle bus. Paul explained where we could catch the shuttle bus but also was able to arrange a taxi for significantly cheaper than 18$ and even promised to be there in the morning to check the taxi was there. We were very impressed once again at this service and sure enough to his word he was there and so was the taxi.Thanks to all the team at adventure Indochina Travel."

We did the three day trip, which allowed us an extra day which meant we could kayak through some caves. It also gave us a chance to get away from the other boats in the area. It was very peaceful. I would recommend this tour for anyone wishing to go to Halong bay, which should be everyone because it is a stunning location. Paul, Mr Hai & Ms Tham were very helpful, not just with organising the tour, but also in giving us tips and advice whilst in Hanoi. There insight was valuable, and made our experience of Hanoi that much better,They have a broad range of different tours, and can also book tickets on coaches to many other locations. My two friends went to Laos through the company and enjoyed the travel.I would recommend the guys to anyone heading to Hanoi, they have great service, with a smile and a friendly demeanour not often found these days.

We spent a couple of hours looking round various travel agencies in Hanoi (including Sinh Tourist) and were starting to give up finding a reasonably priced Halong Bay tour for the next day. Until we found this place! The staff here were great and gave us advice on which tour would be best for our money. It was so refreshing to not be automatically pushed to get a more expensive tour. I explained reservations I had about a particular boat company and was reassured that it would be ok. We were asked if we could pop by after the tour to let them know if there had been any problems.The tour was fantastic. Perfect for our budget and exactly what we were looking for. We couldn't have been happier. When we arrived back in Hanoi we went to pop back in but the staff were busy so we went back to our hotel with the intention of going in the next day. A couple of hours later we had a phone call from Paul at the agency checking we were ok. We thought this was very thoughtful! We also needed a taxi to the airport over Tet which could have proved difficult and expensive but Mr Hai arranged us a taxi for a very reasonable price and we even managed to share with another traveller to save money. Paul met us at our hotel to help us with our many bags and make sure we got the correct taxi at the correct price to the airport. This was beyond any level of service I've had so far in Asia. The staff here are wonderful and you really feel as if they are trying to get you the best deal, not just make money. I would recommend them to anyone."

We asked them about the different kind of tours they offered. We were told not to do the 3 day trip because the weather wasn't right for that (and he was proven right after the trip) although it would be more beneficial to them selling us a longer trip. Then he showed us a few different boatcompanies we could go with, and again he told us not to go on the more expensive one because we could also have a good experience on a cheaper one. So we picked the one he advised (the same trip would have cost us at least 10 dollars pp more if we had booked it by the other companies we had visited) The trip itself was very well aranged and offered everything that we were told in advance. It was well wurth the money and we had a great trip. The day after our trip to Halong Bay we went back to Indochina Adventures to book a taxi to the airport. When we came in the first thing the did was asking us for our opinion about the trip. They were keen to find out if the company offered us what they promissed. After that we booked a ticket for a taxi to the airport. They explained us to wait inside our hotel so the taxidriver could pick us up there, this to avoid other taxidrivers to try and rip us off. The following morning when we came down to the reception Paul (the guy from the agency) was sitting in the reception and told us he wanted to make sure that the taxi would arrive on time and that we would get to the airport on time. That's like the highest level of service we had from an agency during our 3 month trip through SE Asia! So we would recomend this agency to all of you! You'll get good service and a trip well worth the money!"

I had turned up in Ha Noi on a stopover for 3 days on my way to Thailand so I wanted to make good use of the time but not feel I was rushing around doing too much. As soon as I found somewhere to stay someone I met recommended I visit these guys to sort out my day trip.I spoke to Paul first who is a very friendly and funny Irishman whom spent time helping me plan my stay. I fancied visiting Tam Coc and Paul agreed it was a good day trip rather than try and cram in a longer trip further afield. He gave me the lowdown on which package was suitable for me which happened to be the cheaper one so I did not feel the advice was (as you'd normally expect in this part of the world) geared towards money extraction! Tam Coc was a great day out. The minibus was a comfortable relaxing ride and the guide was very friendly, really mixing in with the group and getting to know us. We visited temples and then had the serene boat ride with a happy chap rowing with his feet! Had a very tasty cooked 'lunch' (it would serve as a proper evening meal and I felt quite stuffed after!) and had a wander round the market. Very pleased to go there.Paul also chatted to me about the city, helped me orientate myself (even coming out of the shop along the streets to set me off in the right direction to explore!). Generally other very helpful things too like a few tips on not getting scammed/being safe etc and also they kindly looked after some of my belongings, locked in a safe with a signed reciept to confirm what they had put in there. So I generally felt quite settled in the city pretty quickly. Ha Noi is great, lots of character. It's a bit nutty from a Westerners perspective which I loved. Sitting in the street watching the world go by was a great way to soak up the atmosphere.You'll see almost anything being carried on the back of a scooter, ranging from ducks to crates/boxes about 3 times the size of the bike :) The Water Puppet Show was unusual and a great way to spend a couple of hours and there is a great resturant on Ma May street (can't remember the name but Paul knows it) which you know will have good food based on the number of Vietnamese eating there! So basically I highly rate going to Viet Nam... Ha Noi and Adventure Indiochina Travel. Paul, Mr Hai and Ms Tham are so helpful and friendly, you cannot go wrong here. I'm definately going back as soon as I can."

We were lucky enough to call into Adventure Indochina to book some trips and not only were they the cheapest but the help they gave was above and beyond.The trips we booked with them were Sapa and Halong bay. Whilst on the trip to Halong bay we made friends with some Norweigan people who had paid over $100 more with another company for exactly the same trip. We also booked an over night train to Hue through Paul and all went smoothly. Paul and his crew checked with us regularly that everything was going to our satisfaction and even helped us out when our credit card failed at the ATM... not sure how we would of coped without his help so I'll always be indebted to him.Also when I became ill he called at our hotel and took my husband to a reputable pharmacy to obtain the medication needed to get me back on my feet.What more can I say!? I hope this company gets all the business they need to thrive and grow and its my pleasure to recommend them highly. Paul and crew go above and beyond.I'm happy for anyone who is considering going to Vietnam contacting me to confirm any of the above or give assistance in any way .GOOD LUCK PAUL AND CO YOU ARE GREAT!"

To be honest, this travel agency is one of the best i have ever been!The staff is very friendly and they will really look after you in every situation.they also gave me very useful advices and organized everything for me, so they made my trip much easier and uncomplicated.Paul, the irish guy who works there, even wrote down a plan for me how i can go down south and which stops are really worth to see. he even left his agency to show me some good accommodations in the area of the old quarter !i booked my trekking trip around sapa and my trip to ha long bay in this agency after being recommended there by friends i met in thailand. the only problem was that i missed my bus to ha long bay after the bus back from sapa was 5 hours late (bad weather), but Paul managed everything for me without paying any extra charge. So i went to ha long bay the next day and everything was fine.The prices are very good compared with another local agencies and i can just really recommend them.Just go there if you are looking for a good trip or even just to get a good and honest advise.its a very small agency in the old quarter in hanoi, but easy to find...just across the road from the famous hanoi backpackers.have fun and enjoy you travel!"

They graciously offered me a choice of a refund or credit for a significant portion of my tour - impressed by their honesty and hospitality (they had no obligation to do this) I took the credit as I intended to return to Hanoi someday. I recently had the opportunity to do so, and they were again incredibly helpful and accommodating in setting up my Vietnam visa and a private 2-person tour of Halong Bay.The tour was great -- our guide \"Son\" was friendly, knowledgeable, and honest, and we had a very nice time out on the bay. He showed us some places that were not packed with tourists that he found to be special, and genuinely appeared to take pride in making sure we had every opportunity to see the beauty of his country.Great trip, good people - highly recommend doing business with these guys."

I got quotation from 2 agents and 2 hotels to quote me the price. Prices are comparable but service are priority in my comparison. Only Adventure Indochina are able to provide me a seamlessly tailored plan picking me up at odd time in the evening and in the morning. Some asked you to take taxi to the hotel by yourself and pay the breakfast yourself. In Hanoi, we can be easily conned and fleeced. For Adventure Indochina, they emailed me to say their guide will personally pick me up at airport, transfer to train, from train to hotel and provide breakfast for me at the hotel. These sound to good to be true but when I reached Hanoi, everything they told me is for real. They (Mr Hai and Paul) personally sent me to the train station for my trip to Sapa and went I back at the airport. I made a mistake of paying for a US$28 SIM which I have no use as a tourist and they took the trouble to make a claim for me. No better words can described their service. Visiting Hanoi, Sapa, Halong Bay,..., try using them and you will have no regrets. From a very satisfied customer Mr Tay."

We have now done two tours with this agency and have been really impressed with both!First up was the ha long bay trip which we took through papaya tours. It was great and more than good value! The accomodation on the boat, the food, the staff and the organisation of it all was quality! We had an awesome time!The second trip was the sapa trekking! This was also very good and very good value! We took the overnight bus to the summit hotel where we were able to freshen up and get an buffet style breakfast which was great! The trek itself was nice!!! The guide we had spoke very good English! The food throughout the trip was great as was the home stay accomodation! Again the trip was very well organised!All in all we were very happy with both trips but were more impressed at how well we were treated and informed we were when booking! It is a very good and reliable tour agency, something you may not always get! The guys in there also don't misguide you and will help you wherever they can! They even encourage people to shop around! When we returned from ha long bay the guys here even helped us find accomodation and even took us to a more than reasonable place to get US dollars in order to sort out our Thai visa!You can't buy this kind of service as a backpacker! Absolutely outstanding!We would certainly recommend this place, no question!"

The difference with Indochina is firstly there is a much needed book store (CHEAP) and secondly an english speaking consultant (Paul) who is up front and what you see is what you get!! For $50 to $70 cheaper then the original company we were going to go through for the 'Halong Bay Tour' we believe we received the exact same package. We still selected the more pricey option of $100 however this was still cheaper then other places we had spoken to. As a 30 year old female, the group was a mixture of ages and backgrounds which was fantastic. From here we also organised our open bus tickets which may i add were CHEAPER than the backpackers a couple of doors up. I personally saw one morning (we were killing time after an early morning drop off) Paul at the near by backpackers who had showed up at 5 AM (in his own time) to make sure a group got the taxi they paid for and were not ripped off!! How is that for dedication and awesome service.Paul and his partner Mr Hai helped me with the locals on obtaining items for the LOWEST price and hadIi tried on my own, would have been charged double. These guys are happy to help in any way they can and are UNREAL!I had no hesitation passing on the contact details of Indochina to fellow travellers as i was travelling through Vietnam because I was so stoked with the service i received!!GO AND SEE THEM!!!"

He didn't try to big up any trip in particular or even himself and was just being generally honest and helpful. We ended up booking our Halong Bay trip through these guys and had an incredible experience! They also sorted our bus to Laos for us and gave us recommendations on where to eat and drink etc. These guys are really just here to help which was really refreshing after some bad experiences in Vietnam.Zookie Z I believe that the bad experiences you had are nothing to do with this company and you need to get used to Vietnamese minutes as we call them! These are out of any companies control and Paul was completely honest with us about everything including this so I think your review is a more than a little unfair!For example the brochures for the Halong Bay trip had rose petals on the beds and brand new boats, but Paul was honest with us and told us not to expect this but we had an absolutely fantastic time and the boats were great rose petals or not!Paul is an Irish expat and looked out and after us like family. He has a great team around him and these guys really made us feel better after the usual money grabbing tour shops you find.I would highly recommend Adventure Indochina Travel to anyone who is looking to book anything in and around Hanoi and values an honest view about it.Due to these guys being particularly hard to find I would either contact them first or you will be able to find them if you keep your eyes peeled on the corner of street opposite and diagonally right if you were coming out of the Backpackers Hostel (old one)."

Unfortunately I'd already booked my Sapa tour through an other agency earlier that day but Paul advised me to go for the home stay instead of the hostel which I then did and it was great advice, I had a wonderful time and Sapa is beautiful! The price of the same tour with Indochina Travel would have been considerably less and Paul would have ensured that I was offered the option of taking the soft sleeper for just an extra few dollars which I gladly would have paid. Sadly the other company did not give me this opportunity so my overnight train journey was pretty uncomfortable. When I returned from Sapa I went straight to Indochina to book my open tour bus ticket as they again were cheaper than all the other agencies I had previously got quotes from, even though they all pretty much use the same bus company. Paul ensured I got my ticket on time as I booked to go that same evening and he even saw me on the bus to make sure everything went smoothly! The whole team at Indochina Travel were very friendly and helpful and it was so useful to have a native English speaker who was honest and genuine as unfortunately there seems to be so many companies in the big cities of Vietnam trying to \"rip you off\"! Before I left Hanoi I wanted a cheap but good spa to have a much needed massage after my hiking in Sapa and Paul showed me to a local place only a few minutes away where I got exactly the pampering I needed at only \u00a37 for two hours, pure bliss :) I would highly recommend this company for all your travel needs in Hanoi and around."

We have also booked the private car transfer to the airport, which was reliable and reasonable in cost. Best of all, the logistics for the tour payments were also arranged for our convenience. For example, staff were sent to meet us in our hotel at our convenience to collect tour payments from us and at the same time, pass us the tour vouchers. Highly recommend Hai and his team."

Enjoyed private van transfer to Halong Bay and had a whole junk to ourselves for a fabulous 4 hour cruise with seafood lunch - and our own tour guide Mr Son for the whole day! Fantastic experience and awesome value - highlight of our Vietnam holiday! Pre-booked from Australia and paid for tour on arrival in Hanoi with no problems.

However on checking out Viet Mind Tours through our hotel we found that they were more than happy to accomodate our dietary requirements. Thu Do was our wonderful guide who introduced us to the hidden marvels of street food and made us feel more confident about 'grazing' around Hanoi in future. Particularly memorable were banh mi with egg and herbs, egg coffee, green mango salad with seafood and Vietnamese pancake. Thu sent us a follow up email with details of places visited, details of food with information about each item. A real treasure. Thanks Thu for a great evening."

We were on our first trip to Hanoi, Vietnam and decided to follow our habit and join a street food tour with Viet Mind Tours. They keep a group small, up to 6 people which is a good thing as we did not spend much time waiting for other members of our group to finish their meal and could always grab a table in places we went to. It's a walking tour so expect to walk 3-4km on foot but I did not feel the distance. The tour was 3 or 3.5hrs and we visited 8 places which is a lot food so you won't be left hungry. I quite liked the selection and itinerary as we started with snacks - steamed rice rolls and deep fried spring rolls, etc. Then we moved to mains - B\u00e1nh m\u00ec, dry chicken noodle, B\u00fan ch\u1ea3, and finished off with a coffee and a beer. The places are truly local, you won't see them from the street and you have to know that the place is there to at least walk in.

Trung ngai cuu (Tarragon and eeg fried) : Hang Dau street2. Pho tron ( Dry mixed noodle) : Hang Chi3.Thit nuong ( BBQ pork ) : Hang Dieu4.Banh xeo ( Vietnamese pancake,wrapped with rice paper) :Hang Dieu5. Bun bo Hue ( Hue noodle) : 60 Bat Su6. Nuoc mia ( sugar cane juice) :Hang DieuSome of the eateries were down alleyways and small hole in the walls that as a tourist, you'd never find on your own. She can customize the tour to dietary restrictions and allergies as well. One minor warning to people with knee problems, many of the local places require you to sit outside on a small stool. Again can be managed around, but good to be aware of.The tour also takes you all over the Old Quarter of the city with its unique architecture, crazy traffic, and vibrant street life and performers.Truly outstanding way to experience Hanoi through its food and nightlife!"

Consequently, we were taken off the main tourist roads and shown things not normally seen. We felt very comfortable on the back of the bikes but also oved being in the thick of it. We were able to chat to the drivers and ask questions quite comfortably as the pace was quite leisurely and we never felt any panic in the manic traffic. Highly recommend this tour."

He made sure that they were spaced apart so that we also got to know the city as well. It started to rain so we got us all ponchos.

I booked a lunchtime food tour with Viet Mind Tours and must say it turned out to be one of the best food and cultural experiences I have had in a long time.We explored 8 different traditional Vietnamese restaurants sampling the huge variety of wonderful treats on offer covering Hanoi's greatest hits.Each course was at a different restaurant, some on the street, some inside, but all hugely popular with locals and fun to be part of. In every case we could see our food being prepared and gained insights into the ingredients and techniques involved.As it was a walking tour, a bonus is that we got to explore the Old Quarter of Hanoi, a chaotic jumble of historic streets and locations. Bob, our excellent (and fluent in English) host was not only great about talking about food but was full of fascinating insights into Vietnam and Hanoi's insight and culture.In summary, if you want an introduction into the real food of Hanoi then this is the tour for you. It was impeccably organised, the variety excellent, paced perfectly and the food was stellar!!! I can't finish without once again mentioning Bob (his English pseudonym) as he was one of the best hosts I've ever had the pleasure of touring with. For example,he noticed I particularly enjoyed one of the dishes we ate and subsequently, without me asking e-mailed a comprehensive recipe. That is customer service at its best."

He was very informative about all the foods that we ate and took us to some excellent places that we would never have ventured into without his recommendation! All of the food was delicious, I especially loved the green mango salad - it was that good that we went back the next night to get it again! I highly recommend this tour - the price was excellent for the amount of restaurants we went to, there was a lot of food but it was all delicious! A street food tour is definitely in the top 5 things to do in Hanoi, it is an excellent way to experience the amazing delicacy of Vietnam!"

We booked a private tour though our hotel and was met by our guide Sam (Phuong).What a fantastic night we had, she took us to places that we'd never have ventured into our own. It was such fun night. We went to roughly 10 different food places, and it was brilliant. We tried things that I wouldn't normally have tried. I reluctantly tried 'egg coffee' and I'm surprised to say it was really nice - if I hadn't gone on the tour I'd never have tried it.Sam was great, spoke good English, was very informative about Hanoi and Vietnam, and was a lot of fun. If ever I go back to Hanoi (or anywhere that does food tours) I'd definitely do it again. I'd highly recommend the tour and our fantastic tour guide Sam (Phuong)."

However, this food tour was something else. It was an incredible way to see the city and taste the food. Our tour guide Duy Le was amazing! He gave us information on not just the food but the history of the city, current events, cultural information. He made the tour about more than just the food (which was incredible on it's own). We were here to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and did some great things, but this food tour was hands down the best thing about our trip. We would do it again each time we return to Hanoi."

With raincoats in hand we started on our journey. He asked me where I wanted to go and what I wanted to taste and did not disappoint. I was expecting a 2.5 - 3.0 hour tour that would be somewhat formulaic. Not true. 4 hours later he was as energetic as ever wanting to show me all the best spots in Hanoi. Ha was an encyclopedia of knowledge about the city and its landmarks. Yes the food was great but it was so much more. He took me all around the city to places I would have never been able to go - from the huge Jack fruit tree in the compounds of a Buddhist temple to the temple complex on the banks of West lake to the John McCain memorial to all the food markets on the banks of the Homg River, Ha took me everywhere. I would highly recommend his tour. He will work to adapt it to the size of your group and your interests."

Hanoi is busy at daytime, but even more so in the evening, and you really get the feel of the city whilst doing this. Make sure you get to try the B\u00e1nh tr\u00e1ng tr\u1ed9n (mixture rice paper with beef jerky and green mango) or the B\u00e1nh x\u00e8o (sizzling cake or Vietnamese pancake).

The tour he took us on was amazing!!! He went out of his way to make us happy, and cater to what we wanted to eat and try. He also did an awesome job in sharing his culture with us, and introducing us to so many new foods! He stayed with us extra time and took us to 8different places, one better than the next!

Our guide was friendly, knowledgeable about food and was able to navigate our small group (4 people) in and out of the traffic through small streets around old Hanoi. We ate in different types of restaurants from those with teak tables and chairs to plastic stools and ate an extensive menu with fish, pork, chicken, egg, vegetable dishes and fruit, coffee and beer at the end - not to mention a variety of noodles, rice paper wraps and crackers and different types of rice. The price did not break the bank and the experience was definitely worth it. I would thoroughly recommend this tour to those who like eating food and seeing a different side of Hanoi."

So I asked my hotel if they would be able to book a 2 hour tour by bike? I was lucky and got Jay and Duy. They took me on the back of their scooter and showed us the old bridge, had a beer along the river, went back into town to see the mausoleum, park, tasted the best spring roll we had in Hanoi and had an egg coffee.The best part of it all was different just getting a feel for the city from the bike. We smelled the fruit market (that only opens at midnight because trucks can't travel during the day), saw young couples doing their thing along the bridge, people exercising in the park at night. We got to talk about what Vietnamese life was like and what the local experience is.Definitely wish we spent a bit more time as Vietnam is meant to be done by bike."

But being our first day in Hanoi / Vietnam, it was very overwhelming - what do we try first?! So after walking around for a bit, we decided to book a private tour to help give us a good head start on what to order! And so glad we did - Our guide was Duy and he was so friendly. Before we started he talked to us about what we were after and tailored the tour around what our ideal menu options would (or in our case, would not) be. We are adventurous with eating, but a few things were off the menu for us. Once we established that, we set off. We ate some amazing things that we wouldn't have known to order if we were on our own - and even got to try making our own rice paper. Duy kept adapting the tour to what our tastes were / how full we were getting. It was also great to go through little back alleys and get a local view of Hanoi. The best part was that over the few hours of the tour we also had all our questions answered with regard to Vietnamese culture and history! Once we had completed the tour, we felt like we had left with a friend, rather than a guide. Also was so great to receive an email list of the dishes we had tried so we knew what we liked (which was everything we tried!).Thanks again to Duy and all the best with our future endeavours!"

Duy was the perfect tour guide. Did a running commentary on all of the food as you would expect in a food tour, but also explained a lot about the Vietnamese culture. I would highly recommend the tour, and Duy in particular. One tip, eat a small breakfast."

I arranged for a one on one tour through my hotel and was totally happy!! \"Ha\" showed up at 8am we had a brief discussion of what I wanted to see and eat and learn about, then we were on the moto and off to Ha's favorite eel restaurant. The soup was amazing, the eel sausage was even better and we sampled a few pork sausages steamed in banana leaves and dipped in a fresh made chili sauce...AWESOME!!! From there it was onto the dry beef noodle shop, then onto roast pork belly with sticky rice ,bun cha, sweet black sticky rice and on and on. In all we sampled 18 different things as well as going to 2 different markets and a relaxing cruise around the lake on the way home.I,ve done lots of cooking classes throughout asia that have a mini market tour built in, but this was hands down the best. With my background in food, Ha was engaging and was interested to learn what I would do with certain items....it was a great day, and a great way to learn about Hanoi and the super nice people living there. I would highly recommend this tour company"

Highly recommend the tour and our guide to all our friends, for a local experience of delicious noodles, donuts, spring rolls, green sticky ice cream and egg chocolate, and many more. As it was the week of Christmas 2015, stopping by the St George's Cathedral towards the end was truly beautiful."

A walking food tour is such an excellent way to get introduced to both the city and it's wonderful food. We had come from Thailand and taken a few food tours there, however we were simply surprised by how much better this one was. The true highlight was our guide Nhung/Rose! She was extremely friendly, funny, knowledgeable, and entertaining throughout the entire evening. Everyone in our group of 6 had a great time and a lot of that was thanks to Nhung. She is truly unique in all of the best ways and we are so thankful that we got her as our guide for the evening.In terms of the food, it was delicious. It's hard to remember everything we had, but it included fish spring rolls, an egg dish, bahn mi, a sugarcane treat, BBQ pork broth, vietnamese egg coffee, and a few more I can't remember. It was a good mix of food to introduce you to Vietnamese cuisine, and it was all really tasty too! The tour was also spaced out appropriately so that you never felt too full or heavy like you can on other food tours.Overall it was simply one of the best food tours we have had the privilege of going on."

The variety of the things we tried on our walking tour was fabulous - so same old spring rolls either and there was so much to try Ha advised us to pace ourselves.

We walked through Hanoi while savouring chicken noodle soup, satay, egg-coffee, and popular local ice creams), Ho Chi Minh city tour, river cruise dinner, floating market and Can Gio ecotourism (the last item was their suggestion as we had one extra day to spend, not knowing where to go. There, you can do bat-watching, crab-fishing and crocodile-feeding. Great suggestion, Mike!).

Thanks to his knowledge, experience and good aqquaintance with the locals, we did have a great trip from the view of an insider, not just a tourist. I love the valley/street/and Fansifan view hotel (and we surely will be coming back)"

She certainly knows how to plan according to her clients' needs and expectations. We went cycling in Tam Coc and boating in Trang An. We enjoyed ourselves so much that even the relatively heavy rain failed to dampen our spirit. Sapa is fantastic but is not the place for those who are not keen on trekking. The town itself right now is not so great due to the construction/development that is going on. It is the view of the ripening paddy fields on the terraces, the waterfalls and mountains that are captivating. The 10+ km trekking through mountains was worth it. The trek to Cat Cat Village was also worth our effort. We were greeted by a majestic waterfall at the end of the track. All of us were quite reluctant to leave. Sapa is the place for the adventurous. With proper trekking shoes, the track is manageable. If one intends to trek it is better to go in a small private group with your own guide. You can make stops when you need to and there is no need to rush to complete the trail. Well if you are above 50 and wondering if this place is for you, wonder no more. Our ages range between 40+ to 60 so give it a go. This place is certainly worth visiting."

The lunch was included and it was truly part of the experience as our guides took us to great restaurants to sample typical food.The guides spoke good English, we're well studied and interacted nicely with adults and children alike.I was also very impressed with the organization and logistics. Very good communication before and during the trip with a clear schedule.I paid for the whole trip in advance, which made me a bit nervous in a foreign country, but the agency delivered above and beyond what was agreed.I felt that if I tried to create the same trip myself, I would have spent my vacation negotiating with locals and probably I would have spent the same or more.So glad I left it to the local professionsls!"

No complaints with Tai or Vietnam Travel Consultants; super service all around. If I go to Vietnam again, I'll try to go in the winter.

We met Mike (Tai) who was working from our first hotel in Vietnam in Hanoi (the Hanoi Garden Hotel). We did a street food tour with him on our second night which was a great way to find all the local hotspots and experience some authentic local food with the confidence of having a guide to avoid anything that might not suit a western belly! It was great fun and you don't need to be doing this as part of a group so is a completely personalised experience and Mike was a great guy to hang out with. He took us to a number of little spots including the night market, a place buzzing with bars and night-life to a local ice cream parlour tucked away and otherwise hidden to outsiders. We also had a trip to Ning Binh organised for us with a private car with driver and also a brilliant tour guide called Chang who spoke really good English. This was a great recommendation as it was a beautiful spot and we saw the ancient capital of Vietnam and also the largest Pagoda on our day trip (whereas we were going to do a 4 hour each way trip into the countryside until this was recommended to us!). There were other trips offered to us which we didn't take up purely because we were spending time meeting a travelling friend but, the experience of Vietnam was greatly enhanced by on arrival finding there was someone we could have confidence in, who was friendly and would quickly organise things for us fuss free (it was our honeymoon but I hadn't planned much more than the accommodation). Thank you so much Tai and we really hope to see you again!"

The tour guide he gave us for the, Gary, for our Ning Binh experience is very well versed and speak good English also. The accomodations Quang proposed were clean and reasonably priced. The almost perfect trip was ruined by his driver who picked us up in Ha Long and the same driver we used during our tour in Ninh Binh and back to Hanoi. The driver is so sleepy, doesn't know his way around and drives recklessly. He even argued with our tour guide when he wants to change the original itinerary. Also, on our way back to Hanoi, we had to stop and wait while the car is being washed. When we are in Hanoi already, the driver dropped us in a place far from our hotel and we had to walk and carry our luggage. Gary, our tour guide was very helpful and carried some of our luggage. We thought we were dropped off far because there is a night market, but, the next night, on the day of our departure, there is still a night market and yet the car that was sent for us by Quang using a different driver was able to pick us up in front of our hotel... Quang said he fired the driver with an attitude problem already since I immediately told him about our bad experience with that driver. Also, for four guests plus tour guide and a driver, with luggage, using a Montero for a 2-day trip is quite uncomfortable. Quang should have arranged for something comfortable like Hi-ace van or Starex Van which has a comfortable 3rd row."

We did the 2 hour paddle which was enough - the ladies that do the paddling are amazing, we were more than happy to help expecially when a challange was on from our other boat.. We also visited the Mua Cave where a number of us climbed to the top for the spectacular views of the valley. The only downside of the day was the lunch which was overpriced and not very palatable. I believe it was Tia's first visit to this restaurant and based on our feedback hopefully his last."

I traveled to Hanoi on a trip around the world and had only 3 days to experience both Hanoi and Halong Bay; I was unprepared and Tai Ngo made my visit memorable and was a tremendous help with logistics... I visited many places and Vietnam was not one of the places I had planned diligently for. Suddenly realizing I didn't have much time and knowing very little about Vietnam, I searched online about visa requirements and on TripAdvisor for a private guide the day of my flight to Vietnam. I didn't have a place to stay or a plan. I messaged a bunch of tour guides and Tai Ngo was extremely responsive and graciously generous; within minutes we were on the phone discussing logistics and with his help I was able to easily navigate and travel from the airport to the hotel, enjoy some delicious food, find centrally located hotel at a nice rate, arrange a private tour with him of Hanoi and a day trip to Halong bay. I could not have used my time better. When he came to greet me at the hotel in the morning, we discussed a customized itinerary over breakfast and he have me the choice of using a car services, taxis or the back of his motorbike; I chose the motorbike and we had a great day seeing the city. Tai Ngo is accommodating, responsive, professional and fun. If you are looking for someone local to help you out or you need a guide, his services are recommended."

One of the highlights of our trip, was our 4 days in Vietnam with our guide Tai and Kong from Vietnam Travel Consultants. They created a most memorable experience that was geared at seeing all the highlights of Hanoi, DaNang and Ho Chin Minh, as well as visiting other places we wanted to see...including shopping. Both Tai and Kong provided us with just the right amount of history and current information about all the sites and adjusted the time we spent in each of these places, based upon what we enjoyed the most. They also took us to wonderful restaurants for some of the best food of our trip. In addition, in order to save us some money, upon Tai's suggestion, he matched us with a couple of other people from our ship to tour with. He made sure everyone spoke English and had similar ideas about what we all wanted to do. He also provided us with an oversize van so we had plenty of room to stretch out, since the drives to the cities from the ports were quite long. We ended up spending much time with all of our new friends throughout the rest of the cruise. I would definitely use Tai and his company again and would highly recommend him to any of my friends who decide to visit Vietnam.Steve F...Miami...USA"

My boyfriend and I been walking around the Old Quarter since we got to Hanoi 4 days ago and it's been both amazing and overwhelming. Neither of us have been to Southeast Asia so navigating even really simple stuff is challenging (but fun). For example, we suck at crossing the street. But going around with Tai Ngo was really helpful. We saw many things we hadn't seen and we got a much better general sense of the Old Quarter. He also gave us really great advice on other tours outside of Hanoi that were much more affordable than the ones we'd been thinking about.Overall, we just really like Tai and the tour. We ate some things we normally wouldn't have (sea worms, in fact), and we learned a lot. He answered all our questions (including logistical things, like how much to pay for laundry, fruit, etc), helped us with our Vietnamese pronunciation (still looks hopeless though), and was just really informative. Definitely recommend this!"

We told him what we wanted to do, and he arranged it. My sister wanted to look at some art for her home in Singapore, and mr Tai arranged for us to meet the manager of an art gallery. He recommended restaurants for us to visit at night, and they were wonderful and priceworthy. He also told us were to go to shop and what we should expect the price to be. We had two half day walking around in Hanoi with mr. Tai, to diffrent shops and museums and this was very nice and very effective. Instead of wandering off alone and hope you find your way and are aible to make yourself understood, this is a lot more practical way to do it. Mr Tai knows every corner, and he can tell you a lot about everyday life too. He speaks OK english, and in Hanoi it is difficult to find anyone who speaks english at all. The traffic in Hanoi is terrible, so it feels safe to have a guide help you just to cross the street. My best advice: Decide what you are interessted in and let Mr. Tai know in advance. He will do his very best to fulfill your wish."

Despite of not booking the cruise with Tai Ngo and only booked him half day Hanoi private tour + full day HCM & CuChi Tunnel group tour, Tai Ngo informed us on the weather before the cruise operator did. He went extra mile by offering us options and flexible enough of changing the date of the private tour PLUS arranging a day trip to Halong Bay. Both tour went well. I also booked to join a group tour in HCM, I think the price is very competitive and it was a good quality tour. So Tai Ngo, keep up the good work!"

I highly recommend such a tour for first time visitors to Hanoi old quarter. This tour gave us the confidence to venture out ourselves and make the most of our time in Hanoi. I particularly enjoyed the coffee shop experience and eating from street vendor food. The only point I would make and it is relatively small is that our tour included a visit to a spa. The Spa was excellent and we went back twice in 3 days but this experience consumed over an hour of our tour time. My wife and I would have preferred to meet the reception staff at the spa and book in for a treatment later that day rather than immediately. These comment are by way of constructive suggestion and do not detract from the fact that Tai is an extremely good and knowledgable guide who we would certainly use again when we return to Hanoi, and return we will as this is an amazing city particularly the old quarter. We had a ball and much of that is due to the great orientation provided by Tai. Neil and Donna, Australia"

Our hotel concierge service recommended a private 2-3 hours walking tour along the old quarters and put us in touch with Tai Ngo. Tai made our experience a very positive one to remember - he knows every corner of the town, the good and the bad, recommended great eating places and places to shop. Just let him know what you are looking for and he will take you to the store where you know you can get value for your money. We also sampled some local coffee which we quite enjoyed. He was very easy going and flexible and tailored the tour to our needs. We would highly recommend Tai for anyone looking to tour Hanoi!"

He took us to the Museum of Ethnology, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, Army/War Museum and Hoa Lo Prision in the morning, and after lunch at a restaurant frequently by locals, we drove out to the countryside to visit the old village.

We had good drivers in comfortable cars. He was regularly in touch with whoever we were travelling with to ensure everything was going to plan.

As an older Australian couple who booked on line, we wanted more depth than travel book recommendations. Tai deserves success and in many ways embodies the go-ahead of Vietnam - uni educated with good English, works hard, has ambition ... and yet took the time to get us to the right platform and carriage for the Sapa train trip. His charges are very reasonable and he has wider tourist connections and organisational skills. Highly recommend for all and particularly anyone who is nervous about doing their own thing in Vietnam."

He was already in the hotel waiting for me when I arrived in the early hours of a cold December morning. That was reassuring. After ensuring everything was in order we set out for the tours of Hanoi & vicinity. Did Halong Bay as well. He also made suggestions as to places for meals etc. Each night after the sight-seeing he would ensure that I was safely back in the hotel before leaving. Basically he took care of all my travel needs. My trip was all the more enjoyable with this professional guide's service. Oh yes, price was very reasonable too."

We had several places we wanted to see, and he had great suggestions for a few more sites we would have missed without his knowledgeable help. Tai is very friendly, knows everything you may want to ask about Hanoi's sights, Vietnamese history, etc. He good-naturedly waited for me when I took forever taking pictures, and let us spend as much or little time at each sight as we wanted. He always had a good taxi for us as we traveled around the city - taxi's on your own can be a little tricky. And he took us to the most fabulous restaurant for lunch, Quon An Ngon, I highly recommend it. One of the best places we ate on our 3 weeks in Southeast Asia. He ordered everything for us, and one dish was better than the next! The lunch & taxi's were all included in the price we paid for the day tour with him, a great value for your money. He also took us to a great little coffee house in the French Quarter when we started lagging in the afternoon, where we tried \"weasel coffee\" - a little unusual but very good! Tai's English is very good, no problems understanding him unlike some other guides in Asia. Highly recommend Tai for all your Vietnam travel consulting/tours."

            "review": "Very Disappointing!. We booked a five day tour to Ha Giang with Ethnic travel, and we were very disappointed with them. Before booking the tour we correspond via emails in order to fully understand what to expect from the tour, and what they offer. One thing that was very important to us was not to travel many hours each day in the car, and when we asked Ethnic how many hours we will spend each day in the car they sent us an itinerary telling us the approximated time of driving each day. From their itinerary we understood that apart from the first and last day, we will not have more than 2-3/ 3-4 hours of driving each day. Also, their itinerary said that on the last day we will visit a \"lively market with many arts and crafts\". Moreover, they said that we will have a female tour guide and that we will receive her information and contact details a day before the tour. Based on this information we decided to book with them the tour.Let me just say, that there was a really big difference between what they promised in their itinerary and what we received. It started with the fact that we did not receive any information about our tour guide the day before, and that on the day of the tour we were surprised to see that our tour guide was a male and not a female as they said in the email. On the second day of our trip we discovered that the itinerary that Ethnic sent us was basically full of nice marketable words, but is really far from the truth! We did not spend \"2-3\" hours in the car the following days, it was more like 5-7 hours of driving! We were in shock when we realized that our trip was not at all like was promised, and our tour guide was also surprised to see the itinerary that the company sent us and said that it was a lie. There was no \"lively market\" on the last day, our tour guide didn't know what they were talking about. Apart from that, our driver was not good at all! he was a young kid, that liked to hear trance music. From the time that we asked to stop that music (that was really irritating), he would not shut up- he kept talking with the tour guide, or humming and whistling, and so on. I could not understand why he could not just do his job- drive and be quit. Moreover, he drove really fast and took really sharp turns, and only after I got mad at him he cooled down a bit with the rough driving. Also, our driver was a smoker, and since both me and my husband are not, the smell of the cigarettes really bothers us. We asked our tour guide to request from him not to smoke on short stops since he would stink up the car, but he did not always listen...I would like to state that this tour was really expensive, and me and my husband (that were on our honeymoon) were really looking forward to it, and picked Ethnic travel after talking with many tour companies. We expected to be the center of the tour (as it should be) and not feel like we were just hitchhikers on the car, that needed to make the driver and the tour guide feel good all of the time, on our expense. And as if all of this is not enough, our tour guide was also not the best professional that we encountered. It started with the fact that he actually raised his voice on us when me and my husband found out that we will be spending much more hours than planned on the car, and then for the rest of the day he was really not nice to us. The rest of the days he was pretty OK, but both me and my husband felt that if we had a tour guide that we could connect to we would have enjoyed the trip a lot more. Also, He took us on a hike that could have ended really bad- we were hiking on a mountain, and when we needed to start climbing down, he didn't really know the way, and we ended going down a really steep and dangerous road (thankfully nobody got hurt, but from that day I did not trust him anymore).I will state that Ha Giang is beautiful, and that our tour guide had a lot of knowledge on the different farming, plants, and natives living in the area. He also took us to different villages and let us see their way of life, that was really interesting.So in conclusion, I defiantly DO NOT recommend Ethnic Travel! I am certain that if we would have chosen a different tour company we would have enjoyed our 5 day tour so much more."

            "review": "Good locations, bad communication . Ethnic travels tries to diverge from the beaten path, and they succeed quite well. We booked a two day trip to Ha Long Bay, as well as a three day trekking in Sa Pa. Both locations were stunning, and we did get to meet locals, which is kind of the point of traveling as I see it.BUTAs far as Ha Long Bay goes, you're quite a bit in the car. And there's the waiting. So all in all, you're only 22 hours on the boat, instead of two days. And even though the food was delicious, it's not really nice to charge your guests 35.000 don't for a can of coke or a little bottle of water. Yes, water was not included in the trip. So at the end of our 22 hours of boat, we had to pay another 15 dollar for our drinks. Some minor grievances: we specifically asked a rouble room, which was no problem. Until we got on the boat, where there was no double room available for us. We did get to spend the night with some extra guests in our bathroom though. As I'm not really that fond of roaches, it was a bit of a stretch for me, but traveling is getting out of your comfort zone, right? ;-)Then again, as I said, the location is absolutely stunning, and in the evening you're all alone with your boat on a secluded location, instead of between all the other boats, singing karaoke. As for Sa Pa: we did have a lovely time with our host, Cim. Although the guides are far from the \"perfect English spoken\" ones they advertise, if you try, you'll get a long way. Unfortunately, there is a big but here as well. Since my boyfriend has some troubles with his knee, we asked about the difficulty of the paths. We planned on trekking for three days, and if there would be very big height differences, this would not be manageable for him. No problem, said Ethnic travel. Paths no steep, easy trekking. It was a problem, as the paths were perfectly doable if you're a healthy young person, but not if you have a knee problem. Result: in the evening of day one we had to call the bureau, as my companion could not continue. And of course, that's where the hassle starts. Eventually we did get back a day sooner, but it wasn't easy, and we didn't get any money back from the relatively expensive tour they sold us as \"easy trekking\".All in all they choose very beautiful locations and they work with locals, and you get to see a little bit of the other Vietnam. But communications are not always that easy, and what you see is not necessarily what you get.Then again, that probably goes for 99% of this kind of trips you can book in Vietnam, so maybe you still get the best deal with Ethnic Travels."

Advance payment via internet, settling the balance in person, and pick-up at our hotel all went smoothly. We had the bus to ourselves on the way down to the bay, which is extremely long -- ~5hours. Something to be aware of. Once we were on the boat, however, things were quite idyllic, and we had a delicious lunch and a beautiful ride out to the island we were staying on, and a bike ride to the lodge with a stop at a picturesque beach. At the lodge, a cooking class followed by another huge meal. The bed wasn't the most comfortable, but at least there was air conditioning. The next day, back to the boat (after eating like 100 delicious crepes for breakfast), and another fun cruise with a stop to kayak and check out an oyster farm. Interesting, and not too drawn out. Once we docked on the mainland we got back into the bus for the ride back to Hanoi (with a stop at a very odd roadside souvenir shop that we had also visited on the way out).Our guide, Jack, was nice enough, without going out of his way to offer information unless asked. Still, he kept everything running smoothly."

We had to change our hostel the night before the trip and couldn't ring the agency, because it was closed already. However, the receptionist gave them a ring in the morning and they gathered us at the right spot. All in all we felt taken care of nicely.- nice english speaking guide, even though he didn't talk that much.- yummy and plentiful food during the boat trips and in the lodge on the island.- nice and clean rooms on the boat and in the lodge- we toured away from the tourist crowds, which was nice.- small travel groups. But it's highly depending on with what kind of people you end up with. The second part of the tour our half group changed and from that point it was quite dull.- cooking lesson on the island was fun. Cons:- you don't get what you think you get. The tour description differs a lot from reality. We thought we could go swimming as described in Ha Long, but our guide told us that is generally prohibited in the whole area. What?? Instead, we were pushed to go kayaking instead. Once even two times in one day. Wasn't that exciting of an area to kayak, so we we're quite annoyed by that.Also the itinerary doesn't make clear that we had to go back in the van to get to Bai Tu Long bay. We were a bit surprised by that. 1 1/2 hours in the van again. Sucked for the return trip, as we spent almost 6 hours driving back in a wobbly van.On Cai Long island are 2 \"bike tours\" in the plan. In reality, the bikes' only purpose is to bring you from the harbour to the lodge and back. We stopped at a kind of polluted beach though. - the drinks are freaking expensive!!! For a tour for 178$ pp it's not fair to pay another 35.000 dong for a can of coke that you can get for 5000 normally?! You even have to pay for water. For this price, this is kind of a rip off.- the swimming spots in Bai Tu Long were poorly chosen. We stopped at an oyster farm where the water wasn't very clean and there were no small beaches to swim to. You basically swim between the plastic thingies that hold the oysters down."

Ha Long Bay (and the nearby Bai Tu Long Bay) need to be experienced from the water, surrounded by the thousands of islands out there. Ethnic Travel, and particularly our INCREDIBLE guide Sunny, did an amazing job organizing an unforgettable, educational, and delicious trip for us. Some of the highlights: - Getting to watch the sunrise over Ha Long Bay from one of the more secluded areas of the Bay (because Ethnic Travel anchors in a slightly less busy area, a big plus) and getting to watch the sunset from a gorgeous beach on an island in the middle of Bai Tu Long. - Kayaking around Ha Long Bay - so much fun! (Bring lots of sunscreen and water, though.)- The food. Oh, man, the food is delicious. Every meal is a treat. Enjoy all of it. Just be ready for super marked up drink prices (for beer obviously, but even for water - just bring huge bottles from the land and avoid that). - Our guide, Sunny, was just the best! Kind, excitable, eager to intelligently answer any question you could throw at him. He was the heart and soul of our trip.Two closing thoughts. Don't worry, the conditions on the boat are totally fine - good shower, good bathrooms, you'll be fine. And just be aware that it's a bunch of driving from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay and from Ha Long Bay to Bai Tu Long Bay, so either start talking to your fellow boatmates or just bring a big book."

The food was fantastic throughout, with varied local dishes to try as we progressed with the tour.

They planned it the way we liked it in regards to dates (all together 6 days). The good point is that they take you to places that are less touristic. You sleep in a different place in Halong Bay, where there are only two or three boats. Then you explore a different island (far away from Halong Bay) and in Sapa you stay in a homestay with a vietnamese family living how they live with simple staff in the middle of the nature, great experience! The boat in Halong Bay is comfy and nice. Was clean. Staff are friendly. The guide was a bit shy to my taste, he could have shared more information with us and interact a bit more. Negative points: The drinks on the cruise were a bit expensive.The food was all fried, I never eat fried food so my stomach was hurting a bit, I would prefer all that fish but without all the flour. I don\u00b4t eat meat so the options for me was another small plate of added deep fried fish. Not necessary really as we already had loads of plates with deep fried food. They were rushing us to meet the schedule, so we had little or no time to go to toilet after breakfast as we had to jump in the kayaks. Too many hours in the bus to go to one place to another (12 minute break to go to the toilet in a total of 5-6hours on the bus) and little time in Quan Lan island which consisted basically in getting there, have dinner, go to bed, get up, breakfast, cycle to a beach 20 minutes, one hour swim, and back to the harbour to get the boat. Not enough time for swimming or exploring the beach, even relax! Running all wet to get back! We did not like all the rushing with the tour and we would not personally book any more tours in our next trips. I would recommend take more time to explore how to do things on your own, at your own pace. The good thing is that you have food included and transport which can be tricky sometimes if you want to get to less visited places, drivers could try to rip you off. With the tour you can relax is thin aspect as everything is pre-arranged. Recommended if you want to avoid overcrowded places full of tourists."

I should have stayed one more day at each site by myself to take more time to enjoy."

We didn't want the classic lad-culture trip to Halong Bay, because of the horror stories of unsustainable tourism and overcrowding, so we were thrilled to pay a little bit extra in reward for a lovely tour. They took us on the 1 night/2 day tour for 2 rounds of kayaking (only criticism- could have been for longer periods of time) and we slept in an extremely secluded part of the bay. The guide Kong had perfect English, was extremely knowledgable and told us lots of the history of the bay and the caves we visited. Told us what time to get up to see the sunrise, which was one of the best experiences of my life. Good for meeting people, average age late 20s though tour is naturally a bit couply. Lovely clean boat and en suite bathroom was a plus. Meals provided were varied and explained each time. Thank you Ethnic Travel for a fantastic experience; probably my favourite of our month long trip."

Boat in Ha Long Bay rickety, fried food every meal, rats gnawing at night, deck chairs broken, crashed into concrete mooring during storm in middle of night, ran out of drinking water within hours of 24 hours at sea (!), full trash cans poised at stern of boat on return as if to be dumped with all the other trash into the sea. There's not a tour boat in that crowded bay that doesn't have rats but this particular boat was falling apart in many ways. While Ethnic Travel may have high goals for conscientious travel, it appeared the boat operator may share those values. This particular tour guide with ET, Hang, a fellow in his mid-20s, was outstanding and made up for all other shortfalls. Engaging. Organized. Great sense of humour. Excellent English. Extremely knowledgeable about history, geology, geography, culinary arts and shared that knowledge extensively without prompting. Cave tour on Ha Long Bay overlapped with another ET tour with a tour guide who shared very little with that tour group. Grateful to have had opportunity to travel with Hang. Quan Lan Island tour was more of what we were looking for. Travel off the beaten path with few other foreign tourists. Bikes not terribly smooth running but got us from boat docks to lodge 15 km up island with a welcome swim in relatively clean sea waters along the way. Lodge on QL island was a relief after a night on the boat. Rooms spacious, clean, quiet. Cooking lesson from lodge owner was fun and delicious. Ha Long Bay tour beautiful but challenging on many levels (stated above) as well as by group dynamic contributions from a difficult travel companion, a French father of two who made travel challenging for everyone (they departed at HLB tour docks after the frist night). The tour group the second day, Quan Lan Island tour, including two teens and two younger children (6 & 8), were a blast to be with for the next 24 hours."

You can find all comfort necessary (towels, bed linen, shower,....) don't worry! Foods in homestay is excellent (too much!!). Be advised: trek in Sapa is strong experience, hard under the sun and the small paths often muddy....! You have to have athletic kids!Any way we hardly recommend Ethnic Travel and the tours proposed in Mekong and Sapa (Halong is nice, specially night in Quan Lan Island....but less charm in my opinion).We asked for french guide in Mekong and Sapa tours. We had one french in Mekong but one english in Sapa..... In reality we appreciated talk English (training for kids!!) but maybe if you need French guide you have to clear with the agency."

We booked the tour as there was more kayaking promised then other tours and we were not dissapointed. We had a small group of 8 people and after being picked up from our hotel nice and early, we drove to Ha'long and got straight out of the car and onto the boat. The food was plentiful, and the crew kept bringing us more rice, we certainly didn't go hungry. Unlike other tours our guide took us on a kayaking tour, we left our boat and kayaked for about 1-2 hours through the bay to find out boat moored and waiting for us. The evening was nice and quiet as we moored in a secluded spot, which had been another attractive promise made when we booked. More kayaking again in the morning! Then another big lunch on the way back to the harbour. A great tour, a little more expensive than others but compared to other tours we have done, it was well worth the price"

The good: unusual route in the Halong Bay Area, we were all alone throughout most of the time which felt unique and was very quite so we could really relax and enjoy the amazing view. The bad: no hot water at all, in the lodge and in the cruise as well, though we were promised many times that soon the hot water would work. We were promised that all rooms had A/C while it actually worked only after dinner and turned off at 6:30am (on the lodge and the cruise the same). Food- only for sea-food lovers. If you're a vegetarian or just not that into fish and prawns, you'll probably be hungry. The staff on the boat was very RUDE: at evening they didn't agree to turn on the lights on the upper deck so we couldn't seat and play there and we had to seat on the lower much hotter deck. In the 1st breakfast there was only crappy instant coffee and on the boat they said there's no more coffee when the only pitcher was finished (1 pitcher for 14 people). Last but not least, we shared the boat with a big Rat... All in all, unique route and a great way to see and explore Halong bay although very poor services. A word of advice: bring your own water and other drinks, the prices are ridiculous and they don't even serve water at meals so you have to buy."

The bikes were in poor condition, no working breaks but that was the only problem. However - office staff were disinterested, rude when we asked for help changing a train ticket and a BIG problem, I left a very important bag with visas\\cash with a staff member to put it in the safe at 4pm, at 7.30 leaving for sapa I found the bag left on her desk by the door, she was gone home. I approached another staff member who would not put it in the safe that evening either. The Sapa tour was a shambles. We paid 185 dollars for 2 overnight trains, 2 homestays and 3 days of guiding. The staff member who took us to station spoke no english, couldnt answer our questions and took us tothe wrong train to board. No one on arrival knew when we were leaving. The guides showed up bit didn't explain what overnight bags to bring. The hiking paths were very crowded, restaurants for lunch very crowded. Both home stays were like busy hostels - 15 people on mattresses the first place, over 40 on mattresses at the second place near Bac Ha. No cultural insight from the home stay at all.The company tried to end our tour on 3rd day at 1.30, even though the train was not until after 8pm as they needed the transport to go to Sapa. We rang the office to complain twice - both times office staff hung up on us as we complained. In the end as we refused to get in the car they let us keep the guide until 5pm.Our guides were kind, reallynice. The scenery is lovely. But you could do this trip far cheaper yourself, and get better homestays and trek on paths that were not so busy (huge crowds on the route to Ta Van, which was not the route on the printed itinerary we were given).I feel very cheated by the company. You could do the Sapa trip much cheaper yourself and have a better experience."

Bai Tu Long Bay, Quan Lan, and Cai Rong islands are not at all touristy. Most of the boats on the bay are fishing boats. Overall the food was phenomenal. Our guide was very friendly and fun to be around. THE BAD: Very little to do on either Quan Lan or Cai Rong Islands. The bike ride was hot, and the beach was polluted. Our schedule did not match the advertised itinerary. We did not get to kayak on the second day or visit a Dao village on the third day. At times the trip seemed poorly coordinated and there was poor communication. We stayed at mediocre hotels.THE UGLY: 12 people and all of their luggage crammed into a small van for a 5 hour ride to and from Hanoi. The van broke down twice on the way back and we waited for over an hour in the sweltering heat while the poor driver attempted to repair it with electrical tape and a water bottle. Not kidding. In hindsight, we would not have used this travel company. We also wish we would have booked the trip that includes one night in Ha Long Bay instead. Ha Long Bay is much more beautiful than Bai Tu Long."

First I'd like to say that the company was excellent in responding to email and accommodating my family with a special request to stay an extra night in Ha Long Bay and picking us up the next day- thank you! Overall the tour was quite good. Lily was our guide and she was excellent. She was great with our two boys (8 and 10) keeping them entertained with card games and making sure they were happy. She also was great at answering questions about Vietnam and its culture. For the tour itself we were not exactly clear that there would be so much time transferring from Ha Long to Bai Tu Long. Lily explained that because of special protection of Ha Long Bay the boat does not go over to the lodge accommodation in Bai Tu Long but instead returns to the Ha Long Bay pier and then you travel by van 1.5 hrs north and then by boat another 3 hrs to get to the lodge. At the end of the tour this results in a 5-6 hr van ride back to Hanoi which I'm glad we ended splitting up by being dropped off again in Ha Long and then finishing the next day. The tour- Ha Long Bay was beautiful and the boat accommodation was good. Nothing super fancy but the rooms were nice and had A/C available at night. The boat could use some more chairs on the deck and a few of the chairs needed to be replaced. The food on the boat was delicious with lots of seafood options and great salads. The bay we overnighted in was beautiful and had an interesting cave( Hero's Cave) that we visited the next day. The kayaks on board were good and we enjoyed paddling at a couple different locations. Bai Tu Long Bay- The first (and last part the next day) section of the boat ride is a as scenic as Ha Long Bay but with much less boat traffic and is just beautiful. the second half to the island with the lodge is less dramatic with no limestone cliffs but still nice. The lodge is nice and set in small somewhat sleepy town. It's advertised as a \"home-stay\" and it kind of is as the lodge is attached to a very nice house where a local family has been working with Ethnic Travel for 18 years but it doesn't really feel like a home stay. We made spring rolls which were very good but the selection of food that night was not as extensive as on the boat. The next day's pancakes (like crepes) were very good and a hit with the kids. We then set out on our 8km bike trip across the island. We all really enjoyed this and it was great to see some of the countryside. It was then back on the boat to return. The last pasrt of the boat trip included another quick kayak stop (1 hr) and then back through the amazing limestone karst topography of the bay."

There were 5 people on the tour including us, out of the 14 spaces. The first boat was nice - there was a top deck which was partly covered. The rooms were cosy and the dining area was comfortable. One thing I must say is that the food was absolutely spectacular. There was something for everyone so even if you don't like seafood or rice there were fries or battered pork etc. The route was really good and we barely saw any other boats after the first evening. Kayaking was well run and great fun. Our guide, Sunni, was good fun, friendly and helpful.The reasons I gave 4 stars instead of 5 are as follows: firstly, we are aged 19 and we wanted a tour which would have some other young people, we booked an active Halong bay tour with a bike ride across an island for this reason. However we were disappointed that when we reached Bai Tu long bay we were met by 8 others who were all far far older than us and spoke no English. What made this worse was that only half of them did the bike ride and some complained about being told the wrong information. We may have just been unlucky but it did make our tour less fun and we were lucky that the sunny weather made us occupied all day and not stuck in one room with them all.Another thing that was not so good was the attitude of the crew. One smoked indoors on our way back to the harbour and one evening they all say in the lounge area and watched a movie in Vietnamese, taking up lots of the space. Our boat also broke down at one point due to a faulty engine when we were about 20mins from port so we had to switch boat. You'd have thought they might check that sort of thing before setting off.Other than this we had really nice time and we would recommend this tour. I believe we were just unlucky and that the problems were things that ethic travel could easily rectify."

The boat had a nice top deck and air con in the rooms at night. The food was excellent and our tour guide was lovely. Don't recommend swimming in the water, we saw some massive jelly fish and they weren't uncommon. Would definitely recommend, but manage your expectations."

We had the most outstanding experience in large part based on the Ethnic Travel staff led by our tour guide Ly May Pham. Pham and the staff were unbelievably customer serviceoriented, always focused on ensuring the ideal setting for all passengerson the trip. Pham and the staff had a contagiously positive attitude thatenhanced the experience at every juncture. We were picked up directly from our Hostel in Hanoi and then taken to the port for a bot ride thru Ha Long Bay. Views are picturesque, the food was incredible with huge portions of fresh seafood, and accommodations on the boat were very comfortable. We're able to swim, kayak, and fish for squid on the boat. Second night we traveled to Bai Tu Long bay and he an overnight stay on an island of 8,000 people. Played soccer with local kids, visited their open fish market, made spring rolls from scratch, visited the beach, toured the city temple, and biked throughout the country side. Trip of a lifetime with unbelievable staff!"

We had an excellent guide, Chi, who took us across rice fields, along irrigation systems and up and down the valleys.The home stay was just that, a home stay with a family from the Doa people. They were lovely people and made us feel very welcome in their home. Don't expect a luxury stay, you need to go in with a open mind!Our second night was a stay at the Cat Cat View hotel. It was a family run hotel which, for the price of the trip, was a very basic hotel where the rooms were in need of some attention. There was no choice of the food option at the hotel, I'd rather have been given the option to pay for a meal out. We opted for one home stay and one hotel night. We were asked if we wanted to do home stays and trek further, we nearly chose this but due to our own ignorance of the language and the barriers to communicate with the locals, I'm glad we did the second night in the hotel.The experience was humbling and one I really enjoyed. Thank you Ethnic Travel and a massive thank you to Chi."

And I would definitely recommend Ethnic Travel as the tour to take!! We did the 3 Day 2 Night Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay tour. Our guide was wonderful, such a great sense of humour and always providing lots of information. The boat we stayed on in Halong Bay was great, the sun deck up top was amazing with lounge chairs and cushions. Food was delicious the entire trip. We kayaked around Halong Bay and also explored a cave the next morning. Then bussed to a new boat in Bai Tu Long Bay - this boat was also great, more swimming/kayaking. The home stay was good, nothing too amazing, but nothing negative to say. Unfortunately we were not able to bike on the island due to the weather. As much as I'd heard about how touristy Halong Bay is, Ethnic Travel provided an excellent tour to see the main sites but most of the time I honestly felt like we had the bay to ourselves! Yes, we passed a lot of boat going out/in from the harbour, but other than that there was not another boat where we kayaked, parked for the night or the cave we explored. And we had Bai Tu Long Bay completely to ourselves! This element was a HUGE plus for me."

We booked halong bay through ethnic due to the positive reviews hoping to find a good midrange option, expectations were not extremely high but I expected a good time on a decent boat. The boat on Halong bay was a dump to say the least. It was tiny, smelled awful and the crew was very unprofessional. The family group we were with had told the crew multiple times that they had dietary restrictions and not a single one was addressed (they did not eat seafood and the only thing served was seafood). When they tried to ask for some food other than seafood the cook came out with a disgusting piece of chicken that had no meat on the bone, looked like it had been sitting out for days and was completely inedible. Our guide was very unprofessional and was drinking and smoking cigarettes in the boat the entire trip. The boat was falling apart and looked like it was going to sink and the cabins were filthy and smelled strongly of petrol. It was one of the worst looking boats at the port (this could easily be fixed by a paint job) The most unforgivable part however was there was nowhere to sit on the top deck!! They had a large area meant for people to sit out and enjoy the sun and only one broken chair on the entire deck was available on a boat with 11 people!Our first night experience was so awful that we almost cancelled even after having paid for a second night.The next day we took a bus and then a non sleeping boat to Bai Tu Long bay and were with a lovely group of people and, thankfully, a different guide who was a lovely young woman very willing to help and share her knowledge of the bay. It was a very non touristy part of the bay and we got to have some fantastic kayaking. Our home stay was ok, comfy rooms and a nice family (although it felt more like a drab hotel than a home stay) but no big complaints. We went on a nice bike ride around the island of the home stay before getting back on the boat and taking the bus to Hanoi. A warning on the last day: the bus from Bai Tu Long back to Hanoi is very long but it is worth it! The bay was peaceful and beautiful and we had some very good food on the boat back. I think we may have had some bad luck on our trip as far as the guide goes but the fact that the boat was so dumpy and the no chairs on the sun deck is unacceptable when the whole point of a Halong bay cruise is to sit outside and enjoy the view. It is a shame because the company has some very friendly people working for them but the unprofessional manner of our guide and the lack of very basic comforts on the boat is why I unfortunately would not go through this company again nor would I recommend them until those issues are fixed."

We spent 4 days with our guide Hung in Bai Tu Long and Ninh Binh and left totally enchanted with north Vietnam and the people we met. From start to finish we experienced timely, insightful and conscientious service from Ethnic Travel and their staff. Accommodation was all in local guesthouses with caring and charming families. Food was always delicious, fresh and more than we could ever eat. Hung provided us tons of insight into the politics, history and culture of Vietnam, showed us amazing places, and became a great friend to us. There was a good balance of activities and relaxation time (eg. morning boat ride followed by lunch and a nap in a hammock by the river, then a easy bike ride). If you're having doubts about Ha Long Bay's trash and crowds, listen to your gut and consider heading to Bai Tu Long Bay with Ethnic Travel. The scenery was stunning! When we saw boats they were small local fishing boats and on many occasions (like our kayak excursion) we saw zero people outside the 8 in our tour group. It was the highlight of our 4 months around the world trip to paddle a kayak in the solitude of Bai Tu Long. Ninh Binh was equally stunning, except on land, and we had a lot of opportunities to connect with rural, agricultural communities of Vietnam and see wildlife. Such a memorable experience with Hung and Ethnic travel. Highly recommended!"

The drive back from Bai Tu Long Bay to Hanoi was 7 hours, we stopped for bathroom break at a touristy place that doesn't have proper food. This sucked big time!Less kayak and more time at the beautiful, perfect beach on Day Two. Seriously, three kayak sessions was a bit too much and I enjoy kayaking! But 30 mins at the beach was not enough.The boat accommodations are musty, stuffy and old. The AC didn't work.Halong Bay: Needs to be cleaned of its floating garbage! Looks like a sewer in some palces!Anyway, it wasn't a terrible tour - we made some wonderful memories. For the price (considering how cheap accommodation, labour and food are in Vietnam) I consider this expensive $198 USD - for what we got but I guess these tours are like that."

Firstly a night on a boat was changed at no notice. Also, a Homestay was changed to a stay in a very average hotel. Finally, we were assured that the accommodation on the boat would accommodate our 3 children only to find that the boat only had 2 berth cabins meaning we were one bed short. It's a shame as they came well recommended but we were nothing if not disappointed. On the flip side, our on boat guide, Ngoc, was a very nice lady who tried to help us solve this series of problems, even if it was not possible."

Their boat was nice, and well-maintained, the staff was nice, and everything was well-organized. I liked that it was a small boat, so there won't be more than say 16 people on it at one time. They don't have rooms for single people, so if you are traveling solo, be prepared to share a room. We stayed in a room below, though I think if you get an option, it might be nice to stay on the upper deck.I can highly recommend Ethnic Travels, but so far as Halong Bay is concerned, be prepared for a busy-tourist experience. The landscape is pretty but there are many other boats around you, so you don't get the feeling that its an experience unique to you. Also, at night some of the boats keep their electricity generators on which are very noisy. Not to mention, terrible for the environment."

The boot, thouh not the newest, was ok and so were the cabins (at least the one we had upstairs, cannot say anything about the others). The food was great and staff was very friendly. Tony, the main tourguide, was extremly nice, dedicated and helpful, still we had some communication problems because his english was not the best. So he tried to tell us a lot of surly interesting things about the bay which we unfortunately did not unterstood. The rest of the team did not speak english at all. One thing that was very disturbing was that we anchored in a bay full of rubbish. The bay is not very clean at all parts but that place was especially dirty. We later told this in the office too and were told thats because ethnic travel doesnt anchor where everyone else does. That is a nice thought but when it means it is dirty instead of crowded I cant see the advantage. When we went into the kayaks it was quite disgusting till we arrived around the next corner. We asked about going to some other place for kayaking but it was not possible (mainly I guess because they did not understood us) Nice was the cave we visited there. At 12 o'clock we arrived back at the port. All in all a nice trip and the bay itself (rocks and water without rubbish) were beautiful."

I thought it might be helpful for others if I described our experience with Ethnic Travel and the Ha Long Bay trip as the website is vague.We paid 50% deposit via email and the remainder in person in the office the day before we went to Ha Long Bay. The office was quite easy to find in the Old Quarter. Staff were pleasant (offered green tea) but a little pushy trying to get us to book other tours.The next day we were picked up by a minibus from our accommodation and travelled about 4 hours to the docks. Halfway we stopped for 20 minutes at a tourist trap that sells handicrafts, garden statues, food and drink etc. The toilets were Western and clean. The drive was typical of what you get in Vietnam i.e. fast with lots of beeping. I felt a bit concerned for the driver who obviously drives to and from Ha Long Bay each day (8 hr+). The company seem to have more than one boat in rotation at Ha Long Bay. On arrival we were quickly ushered into the boat, sat down with a complimentary cup of green tea and the guide introduced himself. We were allocated to our rooms (double rooms upper deck, twin rooms lower deck). Our room upstairs was nice enough. The boat is a bit old so the rooms are rickety but it was clean and there was an ensuite with shower. Our friends room downstairs wasn't so nice as it was very damp (including the bedding). Her neighbours complained and asked for the air con to be turned on to help dry it out.After being shown our rooms, lunch was served and was freshly prepared and tasty. The staff were very friendly and courteous. Our guide took us kayaking and we visited some busy and some quiet areas. We saw a monkey and listened to the call of a chameleon and birds. Ha Long Bay is very spoilt with lots of litter and diesel in the water. However the limestone formations are beautiful. After kayaking we had time to relax on deck before dinner. Drinks are extra but not expensive by Western standards e.g. $2/beer (note they expect payment in dong ?exchange rate...). The captain tried to sell us pearls after dinner which was a bit awkward. Air con is only turned on for a couple of hours at night but it wasn't too hot so this wasn't an issue.After breakfast the next day we kayaked a short distance to a cave which was beautiful. Bring a head torch if you have one as we only had one torch between 8! It involved some clambering up and down rocks but our guide was very helpful to those that struggled. On return we had 30 min to shower and vacate our rooms before sailing back to the dock. Those going back to Hanoi waited at the dock for the driver. Those doing the extra day caught a bus ride with the guide and went on. We then travelled the four hours (with stop) back to Hanoi and got dropped off at our accommodation.There were a few niggles with this trip but overall I enjoyed it and met some lovely people. I'd guess this is a mid range option and not budget or for the luxury traveller. Also don't be surprised by the state of the water at Ha Long Bay. Bring extra clothes to change into if you kayak. You can go swimming but the boats (including ours) empty effluent into the water and I believe the water quality to be poor. "

The weather wasn't looking that great, but we didn't think it would matter. Unfortunately, it does.The day we had in Ha Long Bay was nice and sunny, so the scenery was great and we spent time lounging and drinking beer (not included in the price) on the top deck of the boat, which was lovely. We also did a bit of kayaking round the huge rocks, which was good fun.The boat itself was nice enough. The rooms were what you'd expect and I had no real complaints. The food served (included in the price) was really nice and cooked on the boat. it was a really great day and night in Ha Long Bay.in retrospect however, I would have been happy if the tour had ended there. The next couple of days going to the less impressive (in my opinion) Bai Tu long Bay, was a bit of a waste of time and everyone became quickly bored. The weather was cold and rainy, so the landscape against grey clouds didn't have the same impact as on the previous day. Everyone spent it inside the boat, and therefore ignored a lot of the passing scenery. Not the tour operator's fault, but just a word of warning if the weather forecast looks bad. Our guide was fun, whilst everyone's spirits was high, but as soon as they dropped, nothing was done to raise them again and she seemed just as bored as the rest of us.The rest of our trip just felt like we were doing it for the sake of it, and everyone was ready for home by the end of the 2nd day. A shame, as I feel if the weather was good, it would have been a much better trip, but maybe a 1 night trip is all you really need on a tour like this."

Our first trip was the 3-day, 2-night Pu Luong Adventure trip that involves trekking and two home-stays in the Mai Chau area. This trip was excellent. We had originally planned to spend about 6 days trekking around Sapa, but the area was not warming up very quickly and when we found out that no rice would be planted in Sapa yet, we decided to investigate some trekking further south where the rice was already planted. Although the terracing around Mai Chau is not as dramatic or extensive as in Sapa, it was wonderful to see them green. We did ultimately go to Sapa for 3 days as well, and got very lucky with the weather, but were very glad we decided to visit the Mai Chau area as well.The homestays were fantastic, and despite stiff mattresses I had the best two night's sleep I've had in a long time. Both were on the edge of the rice-paddies, and to hear the crickets and frogs chirping all night was absolutely wonderful. In the second homestay, in Hang Village, we had our own bamboo stilt bungalow for sleeping, complete with bamboo flooring. The second location is treated as optional by Ethnic Travel, since it's possible to two the two nights at the first location. I highly recommend making sure you opt for 2 nights in 2 different locations. There were only four of us on this trek, so it was very pleasant.Our second trip was a combined trip -- Ha Long Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay -- of 3 nights at two days. The two bays are very different, Ha Long is visually spectacular but very busy with tourists, while Bai Tu Long Bay sees far fewer tourists and is therefore much more tranquil. The first night is spent on a boat in Ha Long Bay. In Bai Tu Long Bay you stay in a guest-house on Quan Lan island. When we enquired with Ethic Travel regarding a visit to the bays, they recommended this combined option, and informed us that if we wanted we could stay additional nights at the guest-house on Quan Lan island and arrange to return to the mainland whenever we wished. We stayed an extra day. I think we were the only tourists on the island, so it felt very different from the rest of vietnam. Truly a relaxing day after the bustle of Hanoi and Ha Long bay.I can't say enough about this company, and the helpful staff working for them. Their ability to support a large number of excursions, and their ability to customize trips to you liking -- including while you're already travelling with them -- has sold us on this company. We would absolutely travel with them again, and look forward to doing so in the future. Our guide for the Pu Luong portion of the trip, Thang, deserves special mention. A veritable encyclopedia of information on anything Vietnamese, we were calling him wikiThang by the end of it. This is a great company -- you won't be disappointed."

First part of the tour was average bad: 1 night on the boat in Halong bay. The boat was quite rusty and old, in general not well looked after. They promised the boat would anchored for the night in Lang Ha Bay for the night, however we only went half way to a place surrounded by many boats. Kayaking and cave exploring was fun, despite the weather being not very pleasant the water in place where we could have went for a swim was dirty. Drinks were overpriced and offered without mentioning they had to be payed. In the morning, at 9 am and 2 hours before arriving to harbour they asked us to check out from our rooms only to get them ready for the next batch of tourists, something that seemed a bit rude in the moment. Next day we headed back to the harbour where we taken to Cai Rong, where we boarded another boat to tour Bai Tu Long Bay. This part was much better and you won't encounter any tourist boat around. Our new boat was in better shape and so was our new guide, much more professional. The route, biking and kayaking took place as scheduled and the homestay was fine. Rolling spring rolls was also good fun! If you can, avoid the rooms on the right side of the homestay as there are noisy pigs and dogs right beside it.Something positive to remark from the tour is the food provided: SO GOOD! And very generous servings.Something specially negative to remark: the rides in the van. Both ways, the mini van was packed and the roads are so bumpy the combination makes the trip a nightmare.Overall, the tour was fine. Considering the price, might be a bit overpriced considering the first of the tour. However it looks hard to find something with a good quality/price rate under 300 dolars."

They make good choices and the food was the best we had and very variated every day. Sapa with Su as our Hmong guide, was very nice and special despite the cold and mist. Halong bay trip was super organised, halong bay itself made us sad because of all teh plastic soup caused by the immense amount of tourist boats."

Over all it was okay, but to do again I would check out a different company. 1) The smaller van we took for the five and half hour ride got to be uncomfortable while sitting in the back seat. 2) The English speaking guides spoke poor English and didn't understand basic questions. They gave a vague answer, but didn't answer the question. They really didn't give any new relevant information on the area.3) The place we stayed at was far from a \"homestay\" it was more of a small hotel with 0 services. On day 2 they couldn't even empty the toilet tissue out of the trash in the bathroom, in the humidity it started to give an odour. They served the exact same breakfast and supper 2 days in a row.In its defence it was clean.4) The boat ride to the island was pleasurable.The trip was okay, but I think another company may do a much better job.

The Sapa tour was very well organised and our guide was super nice! The homestay was good and the hotel was also okay for the local standard (which is very low for a European tourist at least!). The one day tour to Ninh bin and Tam Coc was also great! Our guide really shared of a lot about Vietnamese culture and history which was very interesting. We were sad not to have gone for a 2 days tour because Ninh Bin is really beautiful! The only less positive point of the tour is that they organise a bike ride but it was too short only 40 minutes and we mostly visited temples during that which was not so interesting. I would have preferred to cycle around the rice fields! I highly recommend ethnic travel!"

He was a very open guy who spoke English very well. Of course he answered all our questions and made sure our trip was perfect, but he was great company as well!The trip was amazing. You spend the first two days in Ha Long Bay, with a night on the boat. On the second day you leave for Bai Tu Long Bay in the afternoon, where you will stay the night on an island. As Ha Long Bay is very touristic you can book (cheaper) tours everywhere in Hanoi, but Ethnic Travel really went off the beaten track and showed us places nobody else visited (like a kayak tour to a cave and a natural beach where we could swim between the marvelous limestone formations with no one in sight). Bai Tu Long Bay is a real addition to your trip: the scenery is quite different from Ha Long Bay and there are almost no tourists. The kayaking and swimming around an oyster farm on the last morning is great as well. If you have the time, we strongly commend the 3- over the 2-day trip. It is a great way to relax and get over your jetlag as well! Ethnic Travel is not the cheapest way to visit Ha Long Bay or Bai Tu Long Bay, but they pay their staff well, go off the beaten track and respect nature. However, don not expect luxury on the boats, which are fine but could have been in better condition. The food is delicious though!"

We booked online a few days before the tour and communication with the company was good and quick. We had requested a specific guide, which the company confirmed, however on the day of our tour we were met by someone different. Lucy ended up being a very friendly and knowledgable guide and we were very glad to have her, but I do think the unexplained switch is a knock to the company's reliability. Ethnic does a good job at keeping you off the tourist trail which we really appreciated. Most of the first and second days were spent at a peaceful homestay in Ben Tre. The amenities were good and the grounds and surrounding village were beautiful. The activities were somewhat more self directed than we expected- This is more of a guided chill-out in a beautiful place than it is a jam-packed tour, so be prepared for lots of downtime. The second homestay was far more rustic but fine. It was really close to the Can Tho floating market which was a plus for an early morning visit. Boating around Can Tho was a definite highlight. Nothing beats pulling up to another boat for Ca Phe Sua and noodle soup! I would recommend this tour as a good way to see a few places in the delta in a short time, but with the caveat that it was a bit boring at times."

Ethnic Travels take you to the quieter areas of Halong Bay away from the main crowds so it doesn't feel anywhere near as busy which is amazing. Bay Tu Long Bay is also stunning and has absolutely zero other tourists (as I believe Ethnic are the only company who go there). It's as stunning as Halong but much more peaceful and serene.

Ninh Binh 2-day tour and Mekong delta 3-day tour.The reasons we chose this tour was the lonely planet recommendation, and a super bad experience with other agencies for Halong bay.The main difference of ethnic travel with other agencies is that it won't take you to super touristy and crowded area. It gives you a really good chance to spend some time with local people and even cook with them. It's just not about going somewhere and coming back but also doing some activities along the way (biking, hiking, walking,...).The Mekong delta tour is a must, as you get to stay with local and go to amazing places. Ninh Binh and Halong bay tours are amazing as well as you would have a lot better experienoce than other people going to super crowded areas.They are super fast and helpful with the email inquiries and flexible with changing the dates, but if you can go to their Ha Noi office you can ask to talk to Mr Khanh and discuss the possible tours based on your criteria, and even reserve your train tickets. Bear in mind that it seems a bit pricey comparing to hundreds of shady tours in Hanoi, but you get to have a unique experience with them.I would highly recommend this tour, and would use their service the next time we come to Vietnam."

Very very well run. Thang was our tour leader and took great care of all of us. He was attentive to the needs of my adventurous but elderly (86) mother. He was always there ensuring she felt safe and secure (for example crossing a plank to get onto the boat), but never condescending to her or making her feel patronised. It was a bit cold both on the boat and in the lodge but that was our foolishness being insufficiently warmly dressed! It was a packed itinerary with kayaking, swimming and bike riding, on and off two boats and in and out of several minivans. At all times Thang and the rest of the staff were planning ahead. All the food was excellent in variety, freshness and amount. There was a reasonable library of books on the boat. The drive back to Hanoi was five hours and we had a train to catch so I was a little wary on the timeline of the last day which included waking on an island, breakfast, tuktuks, boat, kayaking, more boat, lunch before getting onto the main van for the drive. We were aiming at getting back to Hanoi at 6 and it was typical of the meticulous attention to detail and the slickness of the operation that the minivan left for the five hour drive at 12.57! At one point we met some other customers joining the trip. Their driver was waiting with them to ensure that they were taken care of before leaving. The highlight was the bicycle ride on a flat, smooth, wide and traffic-less road on the island. Good bikes and very easy cycling so do have a go even if you are not a confident rider."

I did two back to back tours with Ethnic, hiking in Sapa for three days (four nights including two overnight train rides and two nights of homestay) and one overnight stay in Ha Long Bay.Overall I was satisfied with Ethnic as they had great itineraries and really did take us places where we weren't surrounded by the plentiful packs of tourists in high season. In addition, they kept our group sizes small so there was plenty of time for one on one conversation and questions with guides. That said, I was a bit put off by some of their office staff, and my guide in Sapa was a bit of a mixed bag - very sweet but often walking ahead of us or sometimes on her phone... I think this is just how things are here, though. Still, she was great about adjusting my hike to go more scenic directions in response to new construction of a power plant on our planned route. I would recommend to anyone interested in Sapa that one day is likely enough depending on what the forecast is - my extra day would have been great but it was entirely fogged over."

The Mekong was uniquely beautiful and here is where we thought we had an authentic experience of rural Vietnam where so many people lived. My favorite activities on this tour were seeing the floating market and a bike ride that took us through some rough terrain but it was the best way to see the countryside.

The first was a 3-day boat tour of Ha Long and then Bai Tu Long Bays. Our guide was the intrepid Van, who spoke good English, was knowledgeable and friendly, and also just a lot of fun to be around. A second guide, Luke, came along on day 2 to help a couple who spoke only French. This is only one indication of how accommodating Ethnic Travel was. Everything they promised was delivered - kayaking, delicious meals, bicycling, homestay, cooking lessons, etc. The boat was not super fancy but it was clean and good enough. We really enjoyed his experience in spite of the cold weather.We returned to Hanoi in the afternoon and turned around and went to the train station for a 2-day/1-night tour of the far north of Vietnam. Ethnic Travel helped us find a laundry to leave our dirty clothes to pick up when we returned, and drove us to the station, where their representative stayed with us until we got safely on the overnight train. We had the best quality sleeping car. In the morning when we arrived in Lao Cai, a friendly driver was waiting to drive us to Bah Ka. The whole weekend was great. We stayed in the home of a friendly Hmong family, ate delicious home-cooked food, and explored villages and the Sunday market. Our guide was a young Hmong woman named Pan. Her English was limited, but her sunny disposition and willingness to be flexible more than made up for it.The only drawback of this tour was that it was quite cold, and there was no heat in the homestay house. Once we went to sleep, it was fine, because the blankets were warm enough, but the time between arrival and then was really very chilly. Some heat would have been really nice. On the way back to Hanoi, the driver took us to the China border, and then to a hotel where we had a pre-paid dinner. It wasn't clear to us that we were expected to make our way to the train station on our own (it was quite close-by), that was the only glitch. The train actually left earlier than we thought, but thankfully we were there in plenty of time.Overall we were very pleased with Ethnic Travel. They delivered what they promised, they were friendly and very reliable, and they went out of their way to accommodate their clients. The cost was reasonable, the food provided very good, and the sights incredible. I highly recommend them."

They would often physically go over to the person with us and carry on a three way translated conversation and we would get insights into lifestyle, and the daily and community life of that person. We sometimes were even invited into homes to continue the conversation and watch cooking and everyday household activities and chores which were explained through translations from the host.. Truely an amazing experience. The homestays, although a bit 'rustic', gave us warm memories and understanding of the culture of various ethic groups.

We heard that Halong Bay was too touristic and wanted to avoid the tourist crow therefore we decided to visit first Bai Tu Long Bay (similar landscape as Halong Bay but less known). We went to Ethnic travel as it was mentioned in the lonely travel and that was the best decision we did. They were great! We offer us this option to do both bayes which was perfect for us. On top they told us that with Ethic travel they avoid the places where all touristic boats are going and it was true. During our trip to Halong bay we didnt see a lot of boats (except on the port and at the very first part of the trip) which was great. We did some kayaking and saw only one group of four people once. We also visited a cave and were alone. The food was extremely good and fresh. The boat was good and clean. The personnel friendly. Drinks are not included but we brought our own bottles of water which means that we didnt needed to buy anything onboard (prices are high). We were a group of 7 people. The landscape are just fabulous... For the second part, we were only my husband and me (as apparently another group has just changed their tour for another option). Bai Tu Long Bay is much less know (only vietnamese tourists come during summer) but as much beautiful as Halong Bay. During this trip we havent seen once a tourist and havent even seen a tourist boat... It was perfect we were completely alone and only met fishermen. We slept on a lodge (guesthouse) on a island as in this bay boats are not allowed to anchor for the night. The lodge was good, clean and new with good food. The island was beautiful, the beaches we visited were huge and amazing (unfortunately it was too cold for us to swim). We did a bike tour on the island the afternoon and a spring roll cooking class in the evening (we learned all the steps to do the spring rolls). It was great! In the morning we did some kayaking again and finally went back to the coast. The guide was very knowledgable and friendly. He explained a lot about the bays, the caves, vietnamese culture etc. Also when arriving in the port for Bai Tu Long Bay there were some fishermen bringing some fresh oysters and I took some picture. The guide asked me if I would like some - of course I said yes as I love them! He kindly asked them to buy some but they would sell just 4-5 pieces and instead offered them to us! I had the best ousters ever this evening :) Overall its probably one of the best tours that you can find. They are very professional, well organized and the prices are very good. I would definitively advise you to do both bays as personally I preferred Bai Tu Long Bay but it worth to see the famous Halong Bay too."

You should also be aware, that there is no rice growing in winter, so the patties are empty. On the second day the weather cleared and reavealed the beautiful scenery which is nothing short but stunning! If you get great weather, Sa Pa is a must visit. Our Guide Su and her sister were great and very knowledgable about the region. We learned a lot about their lifestyle, their problems and hopes. Sometimes it felt like someone was showing us their backyard which was a really intersting experience. The homestays got us another glimpse of how their lives look like. The first night we were helping out in the kitchen and played cards with the owner and the two vietnamese architects who were surveying the region. The second homestay felt a little more like a hotel but they were also very welcoming. We were the only tourists at both places, which made the experience more intimate. Although we got a little muddy and dirty (there was the possibility to get a hot shower) we would never miss a chance to visit the villages around Sa Pa. It was a great experience allover."

            "review": "Excellence Tainted by Paparazzi. More importantly who is the Puppeteer?. This is my first mixed review. The excellence of service of Ethnic Travel was over the top for us. Yet we still had a few issues that are much more deeply seeded and may be arguably outside of their control. However, I feel like as a business owner, I would feel compelled to address it anyway. I want to be clear that my negatives are measured here as I don't want it to reflect on Ethnic Travels specifically. I think this is more of a Sa Pa Region travel problem but it cannot be ignored and intense pressure needs to be applied to change it. As excellent as Ethnic Travel and Sa Pa was, I wouldn't go there. It has been ruined by tourists creating a horrible culture of pressure sales. First, Ethnic Travel. I feel badly about being divided in this review. They were excellent. beyond anything I would expect. We were deeply unprepared with a backup plan as we were set to leave for the night train from Hanoi to Sa Pa. We walked out of our hotel to the street being closed for night markets. This made navigating them with luggage slow going. So we get out and get in a taxi. He had no idea where we were going. Eventually he just stopped and pointed. We were lost now. So we called Ethnic Travel and told the our sob story. They asked for an address and said they would send someone. 25 minutes later we tried them back only to find that they had sent someone yet my pronunciation of the street was wrong. We found a local who was happy to help and speak for us. 5 minutes later we had someone there to walk us in when we thought that we were about to miss Sa Pa. Ethnic Travel saved us. At every point, Ethnic Travel did their job above and beyond. The service was fantastic. I would use them anywhere else in the world. They exceeded my expectations with everything they promised. So now that I have espoused Ethnic Travel's positive points, I need to be honest about visiting Sa Pa. We have traveled extensively including developing countries. We understand sales and desperation. We understand that anywhere you go where there are tourists, there will be sales people. You are fair game while walking around. The Hmong take this to a new level. I can understand the parents of Cambodian children sending their children out to beg for them far better than I can the Hmong women. Here is the game for the uninitiated. You walk out to start your trek and you'll find that others are heading your way. This is not by chance. They will put their hands out to help you as you hike. Don't take their hands. As much as they smile, it's a ploy for an implied contract as a guide. What's worse, your guide will ask you to pay them later when they demand it. Your guide is not your friend here on this issue. They are a local trying to make a living amongst their friends and neighbors whom are upset that others are making money when they aren't. They are between a rock and a hard place. The locals will say hello to you. I took to saying, \"Mulvite Czesky?\" (Speak Czech?) and that shut them up. They will ask where you are from. It's all a ploy to get you to start talking to them to buy things. They have been trained to be polite to get money. And like good salesmen, the politeness only lasts so long until they want to close the deal and no objections matter. You may be thinking that I'm heartless and rude at this point. Let me put it this way. I have traveled extensively. No where in the world have I been where sales people can walk up to your restaurant table or into your hotel with impunity. They can in Sa Pa. Paparazzi in California don't get into restaurants or hotels to take photos without being removed. The Hmong sales ladies do. You'll be sitting at a table and these ladies will walk right up to you and impose themselves on you while you eat. The restaurateur will do nothing about it. Your guides will do nothing about it. Saying, \"No\" will do nothing about it. I finally stood up and imposed myself upon a ladies space with my hands behind my back until she was uncomfortable enough to leave. It's insane. But that isn't even it. Later down the road I ran into a nice old lady with a basket of sticks on her back. Classic look so I take a couple of pictures from a distance. She's all into it. \"Let me see.\" We are 3-4 miles from the homestay. The next morning she shows up during breakfast. It was a nice interaction the day before. So I buy $20 worth of stuff as a thank you. We head out for a hike and get rained out. We go back to the homestay to change and relax before lunch. We sit down and take off some gear. We aren't even clean yet and in comes 6 women including the lady we supported. She had went and told friends and now they all want us to buy. Now they want us to buy from all of them. This is basically in our hotel. The homestay person doesn't care. The guides don't care. This is effectively our problem. So I step into the area the guides are in and corner them on the issue. It was me having to have an uncomfortable conversation saying that I understand their position, yet this is our area to rest and we can't because of the people and we are going to recommend people not go to Sa Pa. They stood up and handled it. I had to make other humans uncomfortable so I could be on my vacation. I'm an employer who basically had to go to work for three minutes after 3 days of discomfort. The truth is that the Hmong are tainted by tourists. There are two possible cures. One, don't go there until they get the message. Reviews like this will encourage this but it will take time and hurt great businesses like Ethnic Travel. The other option is for Ethnic Travel and other agencies to organize in standing up for us. You don't find sales people in businesses in Sa Pa. Why is that? Is it impossible to stop these terrible salespeople? Obviously the businesses in Sa Pa get it and have acted. If the travel agencies told the homestays no sales people as a matter of contractual obligation, you can bet the problem would be solved after the first refused payment. Same for the restaurants. If they still can't solve it, frankly open new ones and take care of it yourself and earn more revenue. This is a well known problem and if a plan isn't developed to address it, the businesses that suffer are partly to blame. If they can't do this for their guests, I can only presume that they are in on the action."

We trusted them, and as a result arranged an airport transfer with them, paying $50 in advance. Their cab never showed; we had to pay additionally for an alternative, and when we contacted Ethnic Travel to arrange a refund of their fare they promised to post it to us. We've just opened their posted envelope to find a fat paler if bills...which was $1 wrapped around 110000 dong (about $4.80). Total scam and a massive disappointment. They have cheated us and it's a real shame. We are hugely disappointed considering we had had a high opinion of their offering and they've ruined that with a cheap scam."

She was inarticulate about the area, uninterested in our interests, and brought us around the usual tourist haunts in a mechanical way.

Their van was very comfortable and they had a good driver. The Mekong Delta in my opinion isn't much to see, and at least on this trip you won't really see the country side of it. It's very populated indeed, like one big city from Saigon to Can Tho. The 'home stay' in Can Tho was a bit rough for my taste but had the great advantage of beeing right next to the biggest floating market of the Delta, Cai Rang, which is amazing. To eat noodle soup on a tiny boat, rowed by an old Vietnamese Lady, was a unique experience. Lucy also showed us the local market on land, which was even more astonishing in terms of food stuff, especially fish and meat. The visit to Cai Be before that could have been cut out, in my opiniton, as it is just more of the same, although the visit to a rice wine / sweets factory was interesting. A cycling trip near Ben Tre was beautiful but felt very rushed. The food was great, but I was content not to have stayed a second night. I would have expected a little more insight into the live of local people."

            "review": "Not worth the money - Halong bay (3 days 2nights). My husband and i booked the trip to halong bay and although it was a lot more expensive than all the other travel agency's in Hanoi we had a really good feeling with ethnic travels we thought if we pay that much money ( 167USD per person) the trip is gonna be really amazing and it's gonna be worth it , well think again !!! I will start from the beginning , so we were picked up with the van and the first problem was that there was not enough space for everyone so I had to sit in the back squeezed between the backpacks and other luggage , the aircon in the van was hardly working and we were all really hot on the 3h ride to Halong bay. Once we finally got there we had to sit around in the heat for 30min while the tour guide organised something ( that happend again over all the 3 days and we got really sick of waiting around) . On the boat they served us lunch . I told them I was vegetarian about 6 times and still there was no food particularly there for me the only veg things on the table were a plate of 3 day old cold French fries ( no one touched them ) and a cucumber salad that we all had to share so basically I had 3 pieces of cucumber to eat for lunch. The whole food was cold and no one liked it!!! We thought that it might have been the lunch leftovers from the group on the boat before us. Okay next were the rooms, in the office they showed us a huge room with a double bed , what we got was a dark small room with single beds and a shower that had no water pressure as well as the room had no electricity all day it was turned on after dinner so you couldn't stay in the room during the day as it was to hot. The kayak tour on the first day to the floating village was basically the group of us ( 16 people) alone on the kayaks with the tour guide not giving a s**t or explaining anything . Most people didn't even realise that that was what the office advertised as the floating village as it was just 3 houses on some floating barrels. Dinner was better coz I complained to the tourguide that there was no food for me . Next day kayak tour to the cave was fine. But that was about the only good thing . The itinerary for the second day said we will have the afternoon at a beach and that we will do a bike tour. In reality we got to the beach at 5pm in the dark and had 10min time to look at it. It's not even a nice Beach as its behind a construction site and full of rubbish. The bike tour was basically a race in the dark to the lodge on the island. My husband and I stayed in the back with an elderly couple and we lost complete sight of the rest of the group . It was pitch black and we had no lights ! Later our group members told us that they were worried about is and asked the tourguide of they should go looking for us coz maybe we had an accident etc well the guide said don't worry to them and didn't look for us . Omg I nearly forgot that on the boat ride on the second day the crew decided to help a boat 3 times bigger that got stucked in the sand and nearly tipped our boat over everyone was so scared but begs for life jackets or for them to stop were ignored !!!! The lodge we stayed at was full of cockroaches but alright apart from that . The last day we were promised swimming from the boat for an hour which got everyone excited again until we saw the spot they pulled up for swimming. It was an oyster farm so you can imagine how polluted the water was . No one went swimming and we were left disappointed again ! There were so many nice spots to stop and they managed to find the only filthy place!!! By they end of the trip everyone on the boat was pissed of . I didn't even mention all the things that happened as it would take me to long to write but to make it short: just book it with a travel agency that does it for 120$ as you will get just the same as we did but at least you save yourself 50$ :D we went to ethnic travels and complained as did some others on the boat and got half the money back. But I don't think anything will change as I just read through the older reviews and saw that people had exactly the same problems as we did !!"

And the third day is just a two hors trek to a village with no interest at all (just 3 houses).. we would have appreciate to reach more remote villages (you can see the road and hear the trucks during most of the trek)The last day you go to a waterfall were you can swim, so they should advice you to take te swimsuit with you... hours of trekking: 6-5-2. Medium level. With rain should be much more difficult.About the 3 days-two nights halong bay-bai tu long:Pros: excellent service on board, meals and bedrooms. Great variety on this tour: kayaking, swimming, biking.. Cons: kayaking too short (3x1 hour). Shadow needed on the roof of the boat. Chairs broken. Lodge is not really a lodge but a large homestay.

I went on two trips with ethnic travel - the first to Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay for two nights and at the end of my trip to the Mekong Delta for two nights. They were two very different trips but both excellent. They took us far away from the main touristy area in Halong Bay on a lovely boat whefe we each had our own spacious cabin. Plenty of activities including kayaking, swimming, and exploring a cave meant that we were busy during the day, but had plenty of time to chill up on the deck after the evening meal. All food on this trip was delicious.The second night was stayed in a nice Homestay on an island after a half hour cycle ride with a stop midway at a beach, swimming in the beautiful sea as the sun went down.Our guide Jack was a lovely guy with good English and a good sense of fun.The second trip to the Mekong Delta was very different. The scenery is not spectacular like in Halong Bay but it's a very interesting area. There is a similar amount of activity on this trip, including a fantastic mountain bike ride around Ben Tre island, passing tiny villages, lots of beautiful plant nurseries, and friendly locals shouting hello!The boat trip to the floating market at Can Tho is a highlight - if you can take the very early start it's worth it to see the boats piled high with fruits and rice, and to eat your morning Pho on your boat.The first homestay is great - huts directly over the water and really delicious food. The second is a lovely place with a beautiful jungle - like garden, but the food was not as good. Not bad, but not quite up to the standard of the rest of the trip.One of the best things about this trip was the guides - we had two - Hien and Duong (Sunny) for the first and second half. Both were fantastic... Hien had a lot of interesting things to say and was really thoughtful, whereas Sunny lived up to his name being full of energy and great fun to be around. They were the perfect combination.As a contrast I went on a tour to Sapa which was NOT arranged by ethnic travel - it was poorly organised, very little communication, and I learned little about the area except some of the fun facts given by our lovely H'mong guide.I would really recommend tours with Ethnic travel - I think they were the best part of my trip to Vietnam!"

The Halong Bay section of the trip was enjoyable, largely thanks to our excellent guide (Van). The trip was described as a '3 day / 2 night tour', but in reality it is 2 x '1 night tours' joined together. The Halong Bay trip and The Bai Tu Long Bay trip are completely separate and this was never mentioned online or over email. The second day (which is the only full day of the tour and so could be an opportunity to do some interesting activities) was spent almost entirely in transit. When we arrived on Quan Lan island on Fay 2, we had less than 2 hours of daylight available, and we quickly biked, swam, and then biked to the accommodation. The 'warm and friendly lodge' and 'home stay' description of the accommodation on Quan Lan Island was not accurate. The accommodation was a basic hotel, not a lodge or a home stay. This was not an authentic Vietnamese experience, there was no cooking demonstration as described.On day 3, the cave visit didn't occur, we spent about 1+ hour on Cai Rong island waiting for our van to arrive, before spending 5.5 hours in the van back to Hanoi. More time was spent waiting/travelling than on the activities stated in the itinerary.If you want to see Halong Bay (in all its polluted glory!), I\u2019d recommend the Halong Bay section, but don\u2019t think the rest of the trip was accurately described or worth the time."

Everything was great even when we had a big delay on arriving to to the boat due to traffic on te road.We slept in a hostel in an isand that apparently belongs to the company. It was ok but it is away from the shore and not in an special part fof the bay. I would have prefer to wake up having views to the bay. Apart from that the rest of the trip was very nices, incuding the bikes ride to the beach."

            "review": "Great tour through Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay. We booked the 3 day Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay Tour\u00a0 in advance online. It was very easy and the communication was perfect. They were very flexible meeting all of our wishes and replied to all of our messages instantly. On the day of departure we got picked up at the hotel and were taken to Halong Bay port by their comfortable spacious car. We got drinks and a guide gave us some background information on Vietnamese culture. After waiting for a little bit at the harbor we left with a group of 14 people and started with our first of awesome meals. The cabins are for two people, are relatively big and even have a private bathroom and an AC for the night. After riding the boat through the beautiful scenery of Halong Bay for about three hours - while relaxing on the sun deck - we arrived at a floating village. There we kayaked through the village and around the huge rocks where we also had a little swim. In the next morning we kayaked to a cave where we climbed inside and got to see a gorgeous view of the surrounding rocks in the ocean. After that we paddeled to a small beach and enjoyed a morning swim. (Note: Halong Bay is a very touristy area but incredible beautiful. Make sure to bring enough of your own drinks in advance because everything is very overpriced there.)Then we headed back to the harbor where we switched into a car and were driven to the Bai Tu Long Bay and boarded another nice boat with a sun deck. After three hours we arrived at the island where we got welcomed with really good quality mountain bikes which we rode to a nice but trashy beach. At night we made spring rolls and enjoyed another delicious meal. On the next day we took the boat to a oyster plantation where we could kayak and swim again and were then taken back to the harbor and back to Hanoi.It was such an awesome tour and I can highly recommend Ethnic travel. It was a good mixture of easy to do activities, sight seeing with a good quantity of cultural information and relaxing time. Ethnic travel is a little bit more expensive than other tour operators but it's definitely worth every cent. The service was excellent, the guides very knowledgeable, the crew super friendly and competent, the programme so much fun and the food was more than amazing. I think some dishes were one of the best ones I've ever had."

Halong bay is definitely a must see but Bai Tu Long bay is as beautiful and way less touristy (we barely see any tourists in Bay Tu Long bay). Ethnic travel might not be the cheapest agency on the market but the organisation is very efficient and flexible, the groups are smaller than other tours, the boats are pretty comfortable, food served is very good and the staff very friendly. We also really liked all the different activities included in the tour: kayaking, swimming, cycling, etc. which enabled us to go out of the beaten tracks."

We didn't want to go on a touristy tour so we chose the 'Sapa Adventure' tour advertised on Ethnic Travel website. When we arrived in Sapa, the staff was not aware of the specific tour we had booked and was about to take us on the normal touristy route. Because we insisted and thanks to our brilliant guide, at the end we did take the Sapa Adventure tour... a path which was extremely difficult in the rainy season and not adapted to our family with children (the guide said that she had not been on that route for one year!). So beware if you want a different tour,, make sure that you are actually going there and that it is feasible (not sure the office in Hanoi knows much!).To Ethnic Travel credit, their local guide was fantastic and once we decided to give up after 4 hours covered in mud, they arranged for transport to Sapa and the night in a nice hotel, all free of charge.In short, efficient company but beware if you want something a bit uncommon."

An important thing to know is you will sleep in real vietnamiese homestay so very basic confort. 2days in baitu lang bay which were an incredible visit with amazing landscapes. We slept in a lodge in a dirty island. We even saw rat in the kitchen. The really bad thing during our trip was the guide (Nam) who was terrible. We didnt have enough bottle of water on the boat (3hours) and he yelled at us when we complained. He seemed high the whole time and was agressive sometimes. The really good part was our trip to Ninh Bin with a really nice guide (Kee) and in a nice lodge with very good food. He brought us to non touristic places and to have lunch in a vietnamiese family. It was delicious and they were very kind. I recommend ethnic travels for nin binh but definitely not for baitu Lang bay (even if it s inevitable during a trip in vietnam)"

            "review": "Enjoyable 3 days Halong bay and Bai Tu Long Bay tour. My sister and I did the 3 days Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay tour. Remember to bring your passport as anywhere in Vietnam, although as I was staying with my sister at her home, we forgot but found scans on our phones were good enough. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it though, just remember! Note it is about a 3-4 hour drive to Halong bay with an obligatory 20 minute stop at service station which includes a touristy shop with snacks, scarves, expensive jewellery and garden sculptures. I wonder how many people think that this is the perfect time, on the way to Halong bay, to buy a water feature for the garden about 10,000 miles away! It must work because there are lots of these on the way, and each halong tourist company stops at their preferred one. Someone says they get commission and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. However note, there are good western toilets now, an improvement from my last trip 3 years ago. We spent one night on the boat and the other on a \u201chomestay\u201d on an island. Quite a nice mix of experiences. Food is served communally, and vegetarians can be catered for if prearranged. All meals are banquet style, as is common in Vietnam with lots of dishes so you help yourself to what you fancy. Drinks are separate, although in reality they are not too expensive overall, however you might want to bring a big bottle of water or two with you to save a few pennies.We kayaked three times on this trip, which for me was once too many, but I decided to swim/sunbathe instead which was fine. The boat was moored in a bay overnight next to another ethnic travel boat. You could see other much bigger boats in the distance, but it was quite peaceful. A companion wanted to sleep on desk and much to my surprise she did and saw a beautiful sunrise. Note sunrise is always best 30-40 minutes before it comes up (esp. for pictures), I only got up 20 minutes before and missed the best bit. If it is a good one it is absolutely wondrous with the karst backdrop and worth getting up for. For the quick trip over to a cave via kayaks I would suggest walking sandals if possible, the vietnamese are happy to do it in flip flops but I am not sure it in most westerner temperaments to do a proper, albeit short walk without some grip on your shoe.As the boat goes back to the harbour after the first night, Ethnic travel have the ability to have some people just doing one night and others doing two, and we joined groups with people for the next door boat for the hour long drive to Bai Tu Long and a new boat. This time it was just a cruiser as we would be spending the night on an island. We meet a new guide who explains the folklore surrounding the names of Ha Long and Bai Tu Long bays. This part was truly relaxing. The previous day had felt a bit like rushing from one thing to the next, but now were tootling along, and enjoying the views slowly. Do the extra day if you have the time. Our third kayaking stop was next to an oyster farm and then onwards towards Quan Lan Island, arriving just as the sun was setting. Bai Tu Long is not as striking as within the Ha Long karsts but just as awe inspiring. Yourself and bags are transferred to the \u2018home stay\u2019 on motorbike powered tuk tuks. It feels quite like a B&B/hotel. The village has a feeling of being a real place that people live, with the main income being fishing as there was no fertile land that could be farmed. Now they have electricity all day every day, tourism is starting to take hold and lots of hotels are springing up. I wondered what the place would be like a few years down the road, for now at least it was lovely. The evening starts with a cooking demonstration of how to make spring rolls with audience participation in some chopping and then everyone can have a go at rolling the spring rolls. It being a home stay we help to set the table. Dinner is enjoyed together once more communally with many dishes including our own spring rolls, rice, morning glory, clams, slightly doggy prawns and the sauces. Fruit ended the meal.The group activities start with breakfast but if you want to go to the early morning market or have a stoll it is up to you. I managed to find my way to the beach for sunrise again, but is at least a 20-30 minutes walk there and you need to back for breakfast at 7am. The market is quite small, but interesting if you never seen a asian food market. Bags are back on the tuk tuk and we bicycle to a different beach (helmets are provided if you want them). After a lovely dip, playing in the waves (the water gets deep quickly) we ride onwards to the boat waiting for us. The boat returns to the harbour and then you have about a 5 hour drive back to Hanoi arriving at between 5-6pm.Small negative: The old slightly annoying thing was we decided to pay about $10 each more to go with a smaller group. We ended up being on the bigger one. Apparently this was due to numbers and the fact that they have lone travellers and they can\u2019t pair up boy and girl strangers in one room obviously. Was a bit annoying as the other boat seemed to have fresher furniture and luxury, but in the end we had a lovely group who were mostly english speaking. The other was mostly french speaking. When we complained they were happy to refund us the difference and our guide phoned on ahead to the office."

Homestay: The itinerary described it as an ethnic minority Tay homestay. In fact no one in the family spoke Tay and the place was kitted with WiFi and a television. Hardly an authentic cultural experience. It felt more like a cheap hotel. I would prefer going balls deep into a culture or stay at a nice place, one or the other. Also there are over a dozen 'homestays' in that village, clearly on the tourist trail. Trekking: First 'trek' included getting out of the car on a concrete road and walking about 2 miles of paved road that the car drives down anyway. Misleading calling it a trek.Second trek included a sweltering hike up a hill to a village in which we simply passed through. No chance to spend any time with the hill tribes to form cross cultural experiences. The guide: No efforts were made to translate between us and the homestay family. One of our key motivations for booking a tour was understanding the culture more. On one occasion she watched films on her phone while we ate. The guide was not local, from a different part of the country, despite the fact that local knowledgeable guides are easy to come by at Ba Be and put money directly into local hands.This tour really isn't for the intrepid. It could possibly suit those wanting a relaxed and easy experience still with some creature comforts and maybe in the age bracket of 50+. Essentially, for tourists not travellers."

We hadnt realised that your space was not reserved until you had completed your payment online (our mistake) but it had been difficult whilst travelling to get the time to make the payment. For that reason we had a bit of a mixed up tour, we were first of all collected by an ethnic travel agent from our hotel in Hanoi to make a payment in person at their office. This was a little bit rushed and pushy but like I said we should have paid online when we had the chance. We then were told that we would be travelling on a different boat for the first part of one day then transferred to our actual accomodation that afternoon. We had no choice and it was too late notice to start shifting things around. The next day we were collected from our hotel lobby and driven to Halong bay in a small car with just the two of us as they had to make adjustments to suit our circumstances. The drive was pleasent and we stopped briefly at an oyster farm (dont know why) but our driver didnt put any pressure on us to spend too much time there which was nice. When we arrived to meet the group for our temporary boat it was a little awkward as they had been travelling together in a tour and didnt seem happy with our arrival. It was nice how a few of them thought speaking in their native flemish would confuse us and leave us unaware of what they were saying but to be honest too many borrowed english words made it very easy to figure out. We kept to ourselves and spoke primarily to the friendlier people and when introduced to the tour guide, we relaxed a little as he was extremely friendly and informative. We started our journey on the boat being once again made to feel uncomfortable as a few of the other passengers were continiously questioning the tour guide on where we would be sitting, would there be enough seats for everyone, would there be enough kayaks and what were the sleeping arrangements if there were only enough rooms for 13 people...seemingly not getting that we werent staying on the boat even though the tour guide had told them so! Kayaking was lots of fun and when we returned we got to change boats! So a quick check into our room which was lovely and clean and ready for dinner with a new group who were very friendly, chatty and a lot less uptight. The person who really made the remainder or the tour however was our tour guide Hung, a huge Manchester united fan who had a great sense of humour. I dont know how much experience he has had prior to this trip as he seemed a little nervous at times but this didnt take away from how friendly and funny he was and the great effort he put into answering any questions we had. He was so relaxed he made us relax which is exactly what you want in such a senic location. Keep supporting the Red Devils Hung and thank you Ethnic travel for an upside down but none the less enjoyable tour!"

The rooms and boat were nice enough considering the price of the trip. I would have preferred if we skipped the fishing village and instead just kayaked around the islands. The village really is not inhabited and instead is like a mini floating museum. Though cave excursion was fun.In retrospect, I would have preferred two nights on the same board in Halong Bay instead of driving to Bai Tu Long because the bays are similar. The latter has rounder, longer islands which are not ask unique as those in Halong. According to our other guide, Jac, Quan Lan Island's population grew from 2,000 to 6,000 because to the lure of the tourist Dong. (The island only recently got electric lines). And the island in in the process of becoming even more touristy. There is major construction currently going on. Though I did enjoy our bike ride and ocean swim, the first was along construction sites. We saw and smelled the tar being poured to create new roads and future resort sited being dug. The lodge is nothing special. The food was better on the boat but the spring rolls were learned to make were very taste. (I only suggest they make less fried food on the boat. The non fried foods were very good!)Due to the weather, another trip had to stay at the lodge. Therefore,some of us on our trip had to bunk together. And our itinerary was reversed.Overall, I enjoyed the trip. And appreciated the small group experience."

(You can find more information on the steps of the tour on Ethnic Travel's website.) The hike was fantastic, somewhat rigorous but with breaks as needed, and traversed the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. It also allowed for ample interaction with the Hmong and Dao tribes. The family we stayed with us didn't speak much (if any) English, but they were fantastic and incredible cooks - they cooked some of the best food we had throughout Vietnam. A shared room is provided for the group for sleeping - beds were comfortable. Depending on the time of year you are traveling, be sure to bring sunscreen and bugspray - and you may want to pick up a parasol as you head out of Sapa! Our hike was very hot.

However, there are some aspects of the trip that we feel could have been better, but considering the value compared to other operators, it's hard to complain too much.The trip started in Hanoi, with a 5hr trip to the bay with 4 others. We did it the other way round, starting in Bai Tu Long Bay, and then moving to Halong Bay for the second day. The bus ride was fine, if a little bumpy. We then joined with 6 other tourists to form a party of 12.The first day was spent taking the boat to one of the larger islands in Bai Tu Long Bay, and then some kayaking. Second day involved a cycle, a short boat trip, a coach ride, and then a boat trip to Ha Long Bay. The final day involved another kayak ride, and then we were taken back.The kayaking was a delight, as was the cruise through the bay. Bai Tu Long is quieter than Ha Long, but still looks very similar, so cruising through that is nice. The cycle is good fun too, and is not strenuous at all. The spot chosen to stay for the night is supposedly quieter than other spots chosen by many tour operators. The spot chosen only had another ethnic tour boat and one other boat, so this is probably accurate.Food is excellent at all times in the trip; you will eat like a king (but drinks aren't included).The rooms in the boat and Eco lodge are clean and tidy, with an en suite. The bathrooms are pretty basic, but perfectly functional. The air con was only turned on in the evening to conserve power, which we didn't mind, but could annoy others. The boat in general is nice, and for this price doesn't have the fancy things that other boats have, like a huge bar and morning tai chi. Again, we weren't fussed, but others might. The only thing they could sort out quite easily is some shade on the top deck. We wanted to see the sights as much as possible, but had to retreat to below decks after roasting for about 10 minutes.Our tour guide had good English and was informative, but unfortunately seemed a bit bored with her job, and seemed a bit frustrated/exasperated with the group at times. Not the end of the world for the trip, but not great.Overall, the tour is great value for money for seeing the bay, and it sees quieter, less visited parts too. Recommended."

Halong Bay was an 8 cabin boat with a great crew who cooked for us, we requested a vegan meal so they prepared specially delicious local meals adjusted to our lifestyle. Guide Dat was super knowledgeable, caring and fun. After that we went to Mai Chau - absolutely the best experience of the purest Vietnamese minority life and views of wow. We were accompanied by Huan and Sesame- great driver and again very professional and \"at your service\" guide! If you have enough time/money, do Sapa too and compare. No other tourists on your photos here. We decided to cut our countryside trip day shorter and go back to explore more of Hanoi. Ethnic Travel happily adjusted our itinerary ansd transfered us back to the city arranging a stay at Hotel that was fabilous AND a city sightseeing tour with Sunny- he spent half a day with us and that helped to see more, save time since he knows where is what and even negotiate prices!

Everything is on time and they really can improvise (as there was a typhoon on the day we would go to Ha Long Bay they changed our travel schedule immediatly so we had not one problem or delay.Thank you team Ethnic Travel.

Paloma offers more comfortable tours for only slightly more money when booked well in advanced.Overall, the trip was great but the accommodations were only adequate.Room - the room is very tiny and quite uncomfortable. The bathroom is pretty bad. My wife was extremely uncomfortable.Tour guide - our tour guide was very friendly and did a great job showing us around and guiding the kayaking tripsCrew - the crew performance was...interesting. The cook was friendly and with limited English attempted to engage conversation. Others were a little off putting and added to the uncomfortable environment.One comment on the boat is the manner in which the tied up for the night. The crew did not appropriately tie the boat up and the whole night the boat constantly slammed into the large metal buoy they tie up to. The pounding was like thunder, shaking the whole ship and making it impossible to sleep the second night. And weather was not an issue - there was even the slightest breeze."

We did two tours with Ethnic travel.The first to Halong bay, night on a boat, in combination with Bai Tu Long Bay, night on island in homestay. The second tour was private 3 days/2 nights to Mai Chau region for hiking and biking with sleeping in a homestay in a traditional village between the rice fields. The accomodations were clean. Both tours were well organised, The two guides both speak English very well. Their service is good, for example pick-up and drop-off at your hotel on right time. All the food was very good and they try to serve different meals each time."

We ended up having a private tour as no one else had booked the trip to Bai Tu Long Bay. They would even drop us off and pick us up again at Tuan Chau Ferry Gate as we decided to stay 2 more nights on Cat Ba Island by ourselves. Our tourguide Van was very nice and knowledgeable and would really give us insight in Vietnamese life not just by giving us information about the tour but by being authentic and behaving more like a friend. She would even help us book a hotel on Cat Ba and the ferry ticket which was definitely not her job. The food was delicious, the accomodation comfortable and clean and the equipment totally up to date. Really worth the money!"

I sent out inquiry emails to a number of companies expecting to hear back from them in a day or two. Ethnic Travel replied within 15 minutes of my email. They answered all of my questions in full and were eager to help me in any way possible. This same efficiency and professionalism carried itself over into our trip as well. The office staff were friendly and provided a detailed explanation of our trip itinerary prior to our departure. Transport to and from Ha Long City was flawless, the boat we stayed on was clean and the food was fresh and delicious. Our tour guide was outgoing and catered our trip to our group's needs. We spent both days kayaking and swimming around secluded islands and lagoons.I can only assume their other tour offerings are just as impressive. You would be foolish not to book a tour with Ethnic Travel! 10/10 in my book!"

Would give a higher rating if it wasn't for mismanaged expectations about the kayaking. We choose this trip being told there would be lots of it. There wasn't and kayaks plus equipment was frankly awful. The guides didn't strike us as experienced and no instructions were to go or not to go (more importantly) were given before setting off.Did go away from most touristy areas and food was amazing. So if you aren't too fussed about kayaking then definitely book with Ethnic. However if kayaking in the beautiful scenery of the bay is what you want to do then look elsewhere for a more specialised tour."

            "review": "Fantastic North Vietnam trip - perfectly organized. I booked an 8-days \"Inside North Vietnam\" trip with Ethnic Travels and had an amazing experience. The trip started from Hanoi with the overnight train taking us to Sapa. The office ladies were very helpful as I just arrived from Sydney they offered a shower before hopping on the train. Our group was small (4 people), they guided us into the train, explained the pick up situation in Sapa etc. After a shower and a small breakfast next morning in their hostel in Sapa our hiking began: 15 km through beautiful rice fields and villages with our local guide. Nice lunch. 3 of us stayed in a homestay, I stayed in Cat Cat View hotel in Sapa - which was very nice with a beautiful view. If you book the Sapa tour with Ethnic - you should be fit enough to do the hiking I thought it might be too demanding for people 60+ years old... Bring good sport shoes or even better hiking boots. Next day I had an amazing guide for myself. It\u00b4s incredible how these locals pick up the English just because of what they learn from tourists or teach themselves. Ethnic travels does choose local guides and this way you get an excellent inside into their way of life, culture and traditions. I loved it. After Sapa I went to the Nimh Binh Delta - only 3 people, nice & intelligent guide who was very flexible in changing the day activities (bike ride and boat trip) because of the rain in the morning. Riding the bike through those beautiful rice field deltas, seeing small villages in the delta was a great way to experience this part of Vietnam. Overnight stay in a newish lodge, nice dinner - you could participate in cooking which I liked. Halong Bay - a must see. We\u00b4ve been a small group of 6 people and had our \"own\" Ethnic travels boat. It\u00b4s been a perfect group match that made the boat trip even better. I would highly recommend to continue to Bai Tu Long on the 2nd day as it is less touristy. Overall the Ethnic Travels staff altogether did a great job organizing guides, hotels and drivers. There was no issue once and you can feel that everyone is dedicated to the company and wants you to have a perfect Vietnam experience. Small groups - local guides - perfect organization - and sometimes off the beaten track (depending on your choice) - book with Ethnic - they are worth it!"

            "review": "Halong Bay Trip: A tale of two halves. We booked onto the 3 day/2 night tour via Ethnic Travel, having read the recommendation in The Lonely Planet. We joined our group from a dingy hotel restaurant (Hai Au) in Halong Bay, and had to wait a long time at the incredibly busy harbour for 'admin' to be completed before boarding our boat. Once aboard, we were offered a welcome drink (charged) and given our room keys. We were told to be ready in 5 minutes for lunch.We were in cabin 7, which was on the middle deck with a double bed and wet room. Despite the photos, the room was very cramped, basic and hot. There was A/C though were told this would only be switched on at night (to conserve fuel). There was a fan, but this did not work and a lampshade hanging broken on the wall.Generally, the boat was shoddy, for example most seats on the upper deck were in need of repair with few comfortable to sit on and wooden banisters along stairs were rotten and potentially dangerous.We had lunch, which was very good as were all meals (apart from breakfast which served up stale bread and badly cooked eggs), and motored through Halong Bay, which is stunning.We had three main issues with our first day & night:1) The itinerary was extremely rushed, with 5 minutes to swim, less than 30 mins for breakfast, and 10 minutes in a cave. The kayaking felt rushed as well and without proper instruction or safety briefing, e.g. after breakfast on the 2nd day, we took a few minutes to brush our teeth and get ready, to find the group had left without us! The guide would consistently head on away from the group, which meant if anything were to go wrong he wouldn't be aware or near enough to assist.2) The cabin was extremely hot and despite being told the A/C would be on at night, in reality it would be made available for an hour only and then turned off (by the staff). This made for a very poor nights sleep, e.g. we woke up twice during the night because of the heat, asked the crew to switch on the A/C only to have it switched off again shortly afterwards.3) Throughout this first leg of the tour, we were continuously sold to, e.g. 'promotional wine offers' or cocktails, even if about to be rushed into a kayak - then asked for a 'tip for the boat' when leaving.Whilst Halong Bay is a 'must see' attraction and well worth the visit, our experience was poor with no acknowledgement from the company whatsoever that the people on their boat were paying guests!NB - No safety drill given, though there were lots of life jackets.The second leg, however, was altogether different. We joined another group led by 'Thien' (not sure if correct spelling) who was wonderful. She was helpful and friendly, and took care of the group. We took a relaxing boat trip to Quan Lan island, a fun 45 minute bike ride with time to visit a wide, sandy beach to swim or relax. The 'lodge' was more of an Ethnic Travel hotel though very clean and comfortable. The next day we visited a local market, an oyster farm and kayaked for what felt like a couple of hours, enough time to be happy we were enjoying our surroundings and to meet the local fishermen who work there.This second night offers a really excellent and authentic experience on an island away from the tourist crowds.Overall, disappointing that the two halves had to be in stark contrast to eachother but glad to have seen Halong Bay and stayed for the second night."

We then got to go up on the deck and marvel at the sights. After a couple of hours we stopped and got into our kayaks to go to a floating village. We had a quick swim off the side of the boat and then went and anchored for the night. They even let me help them fish for squid! After breakfast we headed out for an early morning kayak to a cave which we got to climb through and see lots of bats flying about. We then headed back on the boat to Halong harbour where we got back on a minibus to drive to Bai Tu Long bay where we got on a slightly smaller boat. We anchored at an oyster farm which we got to kayak around and then swim off the side of the boat. We then headed to Quan Lan island where we got a tuk tuk to a guesthouse. Here we could learn how to make pork spring rolls. They even cleaned and steamed the oysters someone in our group bought from the oyster farm. In the morning we cycled up the island to a beach before getting back on the boat and heading back to the harbour to drive back to Hanoi. Everything about this trip was brilliant. Our guide Hung was amazing, funny and really knowledgeable and spoke amazing english. All the meals we were served were really delicious, lots of things to choose from. We would definitely recommend doing the 3 day 2 night to Bai Tu Long bay as it was a lot quieter and less touristy so you got to enjoy the scenery without so many tourist boats. Was definitely worth the money!"

Fantastic company - great drivers, friendly and personable guides and tours packed with activities that give you, well, a real insight into Vietnam.I did the tours as a solo traveller, looking for a good balance between sightseeing and activities. I know a lot of people prefer doing party tours or getting stupid drunk on Halong Bay boats. But come on. You're in one of the planets most beautiful places and you want to drink vodka out of a bucket all day? Please.I did two tours with Ethnic Travel - The Ba Be Lakes and Halong Bay/ Bai Tu Long Bay.The tour to Ba Be was just me and my guide, Chau, a headstrong, fascinating Sapa lady who made the trip fun and flexible despite my worries that no one else had joined the tour. I highly recommend Chau and our driver Phi, who took care and was happy to stop for photos.What made me appreciate Chau is how she stood up to bad conditions. Our first homestay wasn't great so she complained and moved us to another. And on the drive back, some rude locals took a swig of her iced tea as an affront - she bit back, to their surprise. We became buddies over the course of the trip, and it made the trip pretty special.Ba Be is beautiful. Expect trekking, boat riding, swimming, caves, waterfalls and homestays. More people should check out this underrated destination.The second tour was astounding. Our guide, Jack, was kind enough to help me get a night in Halong Bay instead of 2 in Bai Tu Long, which made it for me. Jack was cool-headed, friendly and very knowledgeable. I highly commend him for the way he managed a little accident we had on the last day of our trip. It was raining and some of the group wanted to go on a bike ride - one young boy fell over, hurt himself and needed medical attention. Jack handled the situation well and made sure he saw a doctor immediately. Soon we were on our way.The Halong Bay/ Bai Tu Long Bay trip is a complete adventure. Food, accomodation and activities (including lots of awesome kayaking) are great, and you really get to bond with the other tourists in your group. The locations are breathtaking, and Ethnic manage to take you down the less-travelled road to enjoy the beauty even more.No other tour company compares. Book Ethnic Travel."

The food, as mentioned in other reviews is amazingly varied for being on a boat. Expect those little things like a solid but aging boat, some delays as travelers enter or exit the journey, and crazy bus rides in every lane of the road (this is necessary and not Ethnic Travels fault) -- make these times fun and form some bonds with other travelers. People with this attitude will love this company.From the start Ethnic Travel responded promptly online. The start of the tour had them at my hotel exactly when they were expected and their tour guide \"Van\" was awesome. She kept a smile on at all times, helped everyone whenever she could, kept us laughing the whole trip and stole the hearts of every man, woman, and child on the trip. I hope Ethnic Travel gives her a huge raise!Our outdoor adventures were good fun although for those looking for a \"workout\" you may want to request a special tour with more vigorous exercise. As it was, we had several short and very enjoyable experiences kayaking and biking. Enjoy."

A great start to our two week trip to Vietnam all thanks to Mr Cho, the best guide we've ever had!!The places we visited were beautiful, but above that, the culture we experienced and learnt about the minority groups in the region would not have been as rich without our chatty Hmong guide, Cho, who shared so much with us from language to geology and agriculture, and even to cultural habits of people in Northern Vietnam. Because Cho was so friendly with everyone he meets, we were invited into a couple of homes during our treks. Tip: Ask for an experienced driver! We were unfortunately assigned with a driver new to Ethnic travel and visibly inexperienced with a manual car (or with driving for that matter). But Cho understood that our safety was a priority, and that we needed a more experienced driver for the winding roads, so by evening of the first day, he tried to insist on a new driver. We are thankful Cho insisted very strongly and for several times, so we could finally get an experienced, friendly one - Tee - by lunch the next day. Our trip was so much more comfortable from thereon. Our home stays in Ha Giang for the first and last nights were very enjoyable. Both families were extremely friendly, and provided clean facilities and accommodation. Our hotel stays for the 2nd and 3rd night were very good too. Meals during the trip were of delicious variety and we were fortunate to enjoy excellent home cooking at our home stays. Treks were gorgeous and not too difficult.It is so important getting a guide this familiar with the region AND willing to share everything he knows with us. This made all the difference for us. Thank you Mr Cho for your wonderful service. We definitely recommend anyone who would like to make similar trips to choose him if possible."

The first night in a homestay (guest house) on the small idyllic Island Quan Lan where we biked and strolled around on the beach and later in the evening in the village and cooked local dishes for dinner. And the second night on Cai Rong Island in a small hotel with a beautiful view of the bay, the floating village and the harbour. During the tour we experienced the local culture, delicious food, and great hospitality. We went kayaking, biking and visited an impressive cave. We felt in very good hands - safe and very happy and saturated with memorable impressions - not the least thanks to our very attentive guide Cong who made every one feel comfortable and shared generously his great knowledge of Vietnam with us - of course in very good English.

I had such low expectations fearing that Halong would be a conveyor belt experience but instead on a boat for just ten people with kayaking and wonderful food, it was one of the most memorable short trips I've ever had. I would certainly recommend using this service. I thought the price was very reasonable indeed for the service delivered and the local insight was pricelessJust one thing, get them to explain how the ticket system works when you are waiting for the train to Sapa, everything was fine but I was a little confused because I didn't understand what was going on at first."

With a traditional junk boat and about 8 to 12 people a trip is made to one of the inhabited islands, where a small bike tour is made to the guesthouse. The next day the boat follows a different route back to the harbour. Halfway there is an hour kayaking.The tour set-up is (according to the descriptions) the same as other tour operators offer. The tour was well-organized, and there was a friendly English speaking guide. Of course the trip from Hanoi to the harbour is a long drive, but that is the same for all tour operators.The lunch on board the boat and the diner at the guest house were above expectation. The guesthouse itself (although not being a homestay as mentioned on the website, but I don't mind) was new and very clean. Since december 2014 there is electricity on the island, so there is hot water and light. There was even WIFI in the guesthouse. The bikes were also of very good quality: new mountainbikes, provided with helmets. The biketour itself is not through a beautiful natural landscape, but normal Vietnamese island landscape.So in total the tour is very good value for the money and I can recommend it. I would only not go again in this period (March) since it is all day cloudy and foggy: no sunshine at all."

The staff there explained in detail what would be offered.The trip itself went smoothly and as offered (apart from that we could barely sleep in the two overnight trains). Even though our train to Sapa was delayed for two hours the tour guide Su was able to adjust our \"timetable\". Su is young, friendly and local guide. Staying at her place overnight and thus getting a great insight in the ethnics way of life was great and very interesting. Since she grew up in one of the villages she has in depth knowledge. We also walked along less touristic routes. The landscape speaks for itself, so no need to comment on this.The only negative point we could mention is that sometimes we didn't really know what will happen next. So for example when we arrived at the train station in Hanoi, the staff handed over the tickets but didn't actually tell us where and when to go.However, when asking the staff friendly helped out.Conclusion:We can highly recommend Ethnics Travel if you want a well organised and safe trip to Sapa. We would book their tours again."

            "review": "Competent Service-oriented Guide Makes Up for Somewhat Shabby Conditions. I took the two night Ha Long - Bai Tu Long Bays Boat tour. The price, at well under $200, was a good value, on the lower end of the packages I was considering, and well below my next choice of Handspan Travel.This tour is recommended if you want to travel like and mix with a local or two. You will certainly be eating Vietnamese noodle soup for breakfast once, maybe twice. If you like seafood, you will enjoy the food. As a West Coaster, I enjoy digging into a whole fish. But the Pringles chips-loving 25-y.o. women at the table seemed a bit squeemish. The boats and the kayaks are shabby. The public WCs could be better and the water didn't always run. On the upside, the junk boat that we overnighted on the first night had a decent enough berth with a private WC that -- despite the typical lingering sewage smell -- was adequate. The room was decent sized, had OK natural light and a comfortable enough bed.My fellow travellers were all 20-something backpackers -- Holland, Swiss, US. There wasn't a huge amount of common space so it was good we only spent a day on this vessel. The weather in February was good enough that sitting outside some of the time on the deck was a viable option. As it was we did a fair amount of bonding both over drink and conversation. There was a surprise or two when it came time for us to settle our bar tabs. Be sure to ask and write down the price you think you are being quoted. Still, the drinks were cheap considering their quality.The Bai Tu Long portion was perhaps the best part. No Westerners here that I could see. We bicycled across the island at sunset -- a narrow isthmus with water on both sides. On the Sea of China side, an amazing white sand beach where we had time to stop over and ponder the vast amounts of plastic and glass that had washed ashore.My real tip of the hat to the tour leader was him accommodating my special request to get me in the right direction to travel on to Cat Ba rather than returning to Hanoi with the group. He was gracious enough to take me to the ferry terminal, saving time and a considerable taxi ride. This made up for the disappointing $18 add-on that I had bought pre-trip. Ethnic Travel suggested that I take a hotel room with breakfast for a few hours to bide my time between them picking me up in the a.m. and the 5 a.m. arrival of my overnight bus from the north. The Mango Hotel, to use a phrase coined by Ashton Kutcher -- blew donkey. The Mango Hotel has a lot of stairs and apparently no lift and no bell boy. The hotwater in the shower is limited. The train station PA system is loud and just outside your window so sleep is impossible. The included breakfast was disappointing and the worst I had at any hotel my three weeks in Vietnam."

            "review": "Bai Tu Long bay \"in style\" 3D/2N tour. After lots of searching, and specifically looking for boat tours to Bai Tu Long to get away from the crowds, we settled on Ethnic Travel - actually a second choice as Indochina Sails had sold out for the dates we wanted. First things first, the tour didn't go to the 'real' Bai Tu Long bay (as marked on maps), but rather to the northern part of Halong, which Ethnic Travel and a handful of other tour operators call Bai Tu Long. Despite that they did a very good job of avoiding the crowds and keeping off the beaten track - on occasion we were in amongst dozens of other boats, but only for long enough to make us appreciate how well they did at avoiding the melee 99% of the time. The view from the top of Monkey mountain is also incredible, and worth the crowds that it draws.Pick-up from the hotel in Hanoi was on time and the stop at the tourist-trap place on route was actually quite interesting to see the large silk embroidery reproductions of photos being produced, while stretching our legs. We arrived in Halong and a few minutes later were boarding the boat and sitting down for lunch. The food at lunch and dinner was good, with about 8 dishes to share at each meal, although a lot (too much!) was fried. Their coffee was amazing - the best so far in 2wks around Vietnam, and drinks were very reasonable too considering we were a captive audience, about $2 for a beer - cheaper than posh hotels in Hanoi and no more than touristy joints in the old quarter.The cabins and general decor were a little basic (rustic?), but it was a pleasure to be on a small boat (4 cabins + 1 for the guide) - we were sharing with just one other couple which meant we spent most our time on board up on the top deck. The staff on board, and our guide Jack, were really friendly and struck a good balance between joining you for interesting conversations and not constantly hovering or making you feel awkward.Good mix of activities, without being too prescriptive - the visits to the fishing villages and pearl farm were interesting and double kayaks made for pleasant paddles around the bays, although only having sufficient hot water to shower immediately after returning to the boat (i.e. not first thing in the morning) was annoying and seemed unneccessarily prescriptive. Catching squid and fishing from the side of the boat in the evening was fun for 15 minutes or so, and karaoke, although mentioned once was quickly forgotten when none of us showed the slightest interest!There were a few other minor niggles:1) Breakfast - unlike lunch and dinner, this was a rather sad afair: greasy, cold fried egg and a slice of processed meat (to be fair they were hot on the second day) with slightly stale bread. Much improved once we abandoned the cooked food and spread the condensed milk from the coffee on the bread, but a simple pho or whatever hearty fare the crew ate would have been much better.2) On the second night we tied up with the other Ethnic Travel boat which meant that the view from our cabin of the bay was replaced with the side of a boat. When asked if we minded we said that we did and would prefer to moor on our own, but by that point it was clearly too late to change anything. The compromise was that we'd move off at dawn so we could at least enjoy the view from bed in the morning - unsurprisingly this never happened, so our last morning on the water didn't exactly start as scripted.That said, on balance the tour was good value for what we paid (about 2/3 the price of some of the more luxury options), the staff were great and they did what we wanted in terms of trying to get off the beaten track."

After a lot of searching we settled on Ethnic Travel and we were absolutely satisfied with this tour. Halong itself is a very busy place and I believe Ethnic got off the beaten path more than others. We didn't stop at the busy and crowded caves. Day 1 was the pickup, transport, and boat ride from Halong City through the bay to the resting place for the night. The boat itself wasn't the newest one ever, but was in good working order, was clean and suitable for us. The room was spacious enough and no complaints about anything. Food was also good, top deck was nice for relaxing and taking in the incredible views. It's a smaller boat, so you'll be satisfied with the smaller crowd (we had 9 people total on our cruise). Kayaking was fun! The 2nd day was great, the early AM kayak to a secluded cave was amazing. No other people there, and the cave was pretty interesting! Very peaceful. We cruised back to the port in Halong City, then rode a shuttle van east to BaiTuLong Bay. On a new (smaller) boat we cruised to Quan Lan Island where we biked, checked out a beach, and settled into the homestay where we made spring rolls and enjoyed a nice meal. Homestay experience was pretty good, certainly not a hotel but more like an expanded home (guesthouse). Early in the morning we went to the market which I'd recommend! Interesting to see and experience. After breakfast we made our way back but went kayaking yet again in a fishing village before returning to Hanoi by 6pm.Overall the booking process, transport drivers, boat crew, guide (Sonny!!), homestay owners were all very professional, friendly, and welcoming. It was a great experience and I feel that 2D/1N is not enough in Halong/BaiTuLong Bay area, so this 3D/2N is a great option. Also a shoutout to Sonny, our guide. He was very knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, and happy. A great guide for all three days. The drinks from the bar on the first boat are managed by a different company, and although more expensive than what you'd pay on land, I think the drinks on Ethnic Travel are a lot cheaper than other companies."

Signing up for 8 days with Ethnic Travel including 5 days of trekking and biking and staying in homestays as well as 3 days total in Halong and Bai Tu Long Bays, we did not know what to expect. With a superb guide, the convenience of our own driver, and the logistics taken care of on our behalf, travel with Ethnic Travel was much easier than what we are accustomed to as \"independent travelers\" - and what these amenties allowed for was the time to slow down and learn a LOT more about Vietnam from both our guide and the families with whom we stayed during homestays than we could have during the same time without Ethnic Travel's services. We appreciated the exposure to rural parts of the country, the variety of activities, the interpretation of many cultural practices happening around us, the bounty of wonderful food, and the opportunity to visit the relatively boat-free Bai Tu Long Bay after our night in Halong Bay. Highly recommended!"

Booking was easy and we opted for the Mai Chau 3-day trip. We were picked up on time, in a smart mini-van, and this van stayed immaculate throughout the 3 day trip, thanks to our fantastic driver Mahn, who took serious pride in this vehicle and safe driving, quite refreshing compared to the rest of drivers in Vietnam!There was a tiny mishap when we were first picked up, with our guide firstly thinking we were on a 2 day trip to Halong Bay, and secondly then telling us it was only us on the trip (when we had been told that we'd be joining a group of 4-8 people). After getting to know our great guide Trang (said Chang) and getting to know her crazy kooky ways, the first thing didn't matter at all. The second thing wasn't an issue for us, we ended up with a private tour and met plenty of people along the way, but if you were a solo traveller then this might be something you'd want to really insist on checking. Our 3 day trip took us about 4-5 hours outside of Hanoi, into the Mai Chau province. The trip was very flexible so Trang gave us loads of options about mixing the agenda up a bit based on her recommendations. It wasn't massively dissimilar to the agenda advertised on the website, but just gave some additional local stops and insight.  I won't go into detail about all these little things, as i imagine it varies trip by trip, but safe to say it made the trip all the more memorable and overall this trip was one of the highlights of our trip to Vietnam. Ethnic vietnam seems to get a bit of a mixed review on TA, but for us (and we can be real sceptics about tours if made to feel like they're staged or like a conveyer belt of tourists!) this was a unique and wonderful trip. Apart from a few other Ethnic travel guests, we barely saw any other westerners on our whole 3 day trip, which we loved! We did this trip as an alternative to Sapa, as this area is known as mini-Sapa, and it did not disappoint. Beautiful scenery, a good amount/balance of activities (hiking and biking), a real opportunity to meet Vietnamese people in villages and the mountains, SUPER food within the homestays, welcoming hosts, and an awesome guide, we couldn't have asked for more. A few more things to add - take lots of mosquito repellant, don't expect a good night's sleep (but it doesn't matter!), embrace the rice wine (your homestay hosts will plough you with it if you want it!), & sample all of the food dishes (there are many...).Ethnic's travel motto is 'Insight into Vietnam' and for us this summed it up perfectly."

We booked a 4 day 3 night trip from the UK to The Red River Delta & Bai Tu Long Bay.On arrival in Hanoi I looked up the offices of Ethnic Travel and after asking about the trip we had booked were convinced that 1 night only in Red River Delta and a night on a boat in Halong Bay was an alternative. This bit was a good option as it turned out, however...What actually happened... Day 1. The Red River Delta trip was interesting and we saw some really  interesting caves on the rowed boat although no life jackets on the small boat which could easily have toppled over. The larger trips being organised at a different location we passed were all life jacketed. The cycling was okay and we did see some interesting things. However we did not do any 'trekking' that had any purpose or interest that was on the itinerary. For the afternoon from their itinerary \"Here, we pick vegetables from the villagers own plots and they give lessons in cooking traditional dishes, such as spring rolls, dipping fish sauce and fresh rice noodles. We then enjoy glorious food with them\". We did not do any of this despite arriving 2-3 hours before dinner. The dining area was very cold as were the rooms, heating needs to be considered and some interaction with guests in this time period.Day 2 . At their suggestion we took the trip to Halong Bay for the second night and this was a good decision, the boat was good as was the food. I did note some of the timbers on the deck and handrails were rotting quite badly. Kayaking is a good thing however the quality and instruction of the use of them is not. Some of the kayaks did not even have a seat! There should have some sort of safety check, make sure people have fitted their life jackets properly and what to do if they fall into the water. Our guide admitted he could not even swim!Day 3/4. We went to Bai Tu Long Bay and this was where the boat got lost due to a non-functioning navigation tool, one of the crew had it in bits on the floor! We did not arrive until it was properly dark, with no lights inside or outside the boat. The crew relied entirely on mobile phones and small torches. There was a serious risk we could have been unable to dock and who knows what would have happened. This was a serious situation and from the reaction of the crew they thought so too. The passengers all were really concerned for their safety and some were quite upset.The overnight stay was okay although this is not a home-stay as advertised, it is a guest house, however and the food was good along with the visit to the local market at 0500. However the itinerary does not mention that there is only electricity available from 1800-2200 each day so no hot water in the morning or lights in the night!The cycle ride is along a rough track which is now part of the building works for the electrification of the island, not before time! and as such is not all that appealing.We then had to return and were put on a different boat with another group because the original boat we arrived on was not allowed to sail on orders of the police the crew told us. This meant the boat we did travel in was overloaded for its licence. This in turn meant we had to stay inside so not to arouse the suspicion of any other vessels or the police of this case. It also meant we had to disembark at a remote location several kilometres from the Bai Tu Long harbour at a building site area which was really muddy and not safe.My issue here is that Ethnic Travel have to to ensure guests on their tours are safe and this in my experience and that of the rest of the group has not been considered properly.I did put all these concerns to them and they have refunded me $100 but i suspect that no changes will be made.One other thing to say and this has been mentioned in other posts, the traveling on the bus times are much longer than they say.With hindsight i would book in Hanoi and probably through he hotel who have a vested interest in making sure you have a good trip."

Perhaps a case of mis-matched expectations but we expected a more polished / consistent and slightly higher end experience from Ethnic Travel ('ET'). As another reviewer said - some good some not so good. The logistics of our 3 day / 2 night Ha Long Bay trip worked out well. Boat in Ha Long Bay was sketchy. Stuffy hot. Equipped with A/C but didn't run the generator at night (\"too noisy\") so the A/C wasn't of much use. Food was good. Skipper was way too pushy trying to get us to drink more and order wine - obviously part of his compensation package. Ladder used to access kayaks and for swimming was not as safe as it should have been (if you really want to immerse yourself in that water UNESCO designation not withstanding). In general, ET needs to change out / upgrade their Ha Long Bay boat. On the good side, the Bai Tu Long Bay part of the excursion was excellent in all regards - overnight in a home stay was excellent, quieter bay with some of the same scenery, pleasant cross-island bike trip. A highlight. Guide was very good - pleasant, good English, occasionally distracted by cell phone. Managed complex logistics of each of us heading in different directions post-trip very well. Driver was a bit of a speed demon on our return but generally drivers were good - need to keep the bus stocked with water. We also booked a return trip on the overnight train between Hanoi and Sapa through ET. Info about departure and return times was very unclear - perhaps even misleading although we should have insisted on more clarity. This tourist class train is a dismal way to travel and the return put us back into Hanoi at 4:30 am - only the rats were awake at that time! :)Finally, we separately booked a single day 15 or so km trek through the ET office in Sapa (at the Sapa Hostel). Manager of this office was excellent to deal with and very good with the details. Our guide bailed last minute due to illness and the replacement guide - a local tribeswoman named Mu - was very good. Ironically, on the cell phone a bit much but still very good and the whole day was excellent. The promised car ride back into Sapa turned into scooter rides for my wife and I. While not what we bargained for, the scooter ride in the fog past dogs, buffalo, kids, buses, pedestrians etc. was actually quite exciting (in a good way)."

This is a review of the Bai Tu Long bay 1 night/2 day tour ($115 per person):Overall an average/mediocre experience. The salesgirl at the office really sold us on the kayaking and cycling and convinced us to stay an extra night on the island in the bay. We later changed this after the brief cycle we did on the tour. The dusty road had a lot of construction going on and it wasn't a great ride. The bigger issue on the tour was really the whole tour concept and itinerary. The first day was a five hour drive to the launch point for the bay, the a 2.5hr boat ride at full speed to the island and finally a 30 min or so cycle in the twilight on a road with trucks to the guesthouse (not homestay as advertised). The guesthouse itself was impersonal but fine, though the \"fishing village\" was charmless. The guide herself advised us *not* to spend the second day biking around the island, and said there's not really anywhere to go but a beach we'd seen the day before. The following day was a quick tuk tuk drive to the boat, another 2.5hrs full throttle and then about an hour for kayaking. Then back on the bus for 5hrs to Hanoi. It felt very rushed and we didn't really get to spend much time enjoying the bay (noisy speeding boat is not relaxing). Pros:Guide was friendly with good EnglishFood was plentiful though mostly friedBoat was comfortable (though lacking running water for washing hands)Guesthouse was comfortableKayaking was good but not enoughOverall not sure what to recommend. Maybe a 2night tour with a nicer outfit but 1 night is too short.For the record we made a verbal complaint to the sales girl at the end of our tour and she was very receptive and concerned.

The huge issue(as other pointed out) with Ethnic Tours, they buy your train ticket right there on the spot, 30 minutes-1.5 hour before train's departure. As you may guess, sometimes trains get fully booked and you have to take the next one. Thankfully there we got a seat on the next one.Tour started much later than expected the next morning as there was a lot of waiting. There was no guide until we arrived to Sapa. Driver on the way to Sapa didn't stop anywhere for us to take photographs.Once in Sapa there was more and more waiting again. Tour said we would have a chance to explore Sapa. We didn't do it as all. Their itinerary and even explanation in person which they made when I came to pay said we would go through villages, see local lives, see different minorities, how they live and so forth. There was NOTHING of that for the first 2 days. We basically walked in the middle of nowhere for 2 day in the mud, stopping at the side of the roads for touristy restaurant meals. Guide was very quiet and she barely spoke. We had to squeeze information out of her! We didn't see any local lives I don't think we even saw 1/5 of the minorities that live there. It was one of the, if not the worst tour of all the tours I've ever taken(at least 100++++). there was no enthusiasm from the guide at all. When I told her a few things I wanted to see and what was said on the itinerary, she just ignored me. Also, the guide is not with you for the whole day. She's just there for exactly 8 hours! ~ 2 hours before sunset she'd leave us to go home/elsewhere and tell us to explore on our own with very little guidance. The only day we got to see some of Sapa region is the last day before our departure. I strongly believe I could have seen MUCH MUCH more if I went on my own by hiring a $5/day motorcycle or perhaps by paying one of the ladies on the road. They are from one of the minorities(the only minorities we've actually seen I believe) and they try to sell you their wares. You can pay them $10 and they will show you sooooo much more(many speak good English).I read some reviews of other tours and what people saw and we had no such thing. The tour was a total SCAM. Their itinerary and promises in person were all a big lie!!After the tour I tried to talk to them,but they didn't want to speak with me and said and I quote\" We will talk later, maybe\".End of the tour was a disaster as well. It seemed many of us paid different rates and for some people they included train station transfers and for others they did not. At the end some people got a ride absolutely randomly some people did not. The person who came for pick up didn't speak a word of English and at 5am nobody else from the company was reached.Basically, after Sapa 5am arrival at the train station we had the 2-night Halong Bay tour at 8am.Ethnic Travel did not provide a place to stay or be. You are left stranded on your own with nowhere to go! This is beyond UNPROFESSIONAL!!! After coming back from this, I have no knowledge of Sapa, how people live, what they do and what minorities live them. We did not see all that in 3 days of our tours as we were busy walking in the mud in the middle of nowhere. Such a shame!! AVOID Ethnic Tours and their Sapa ToursHalong Bay Tour:Tour started LATE as always. Then we stopped for 30 minutes(on the way back as well) at a \"tourist trap shop\". There are so many local restaurants and real places. It's a shame these scammers force to stop at a very expensive shop where they hope you can buy something so that they will get a commission out of it. We arrived at Halong Bay very late and then waited more than an hour for our boat. 100s of other people were arriving and going to their boats and only Ethic Tour's boat was late and were were the last to board. Lunch was very late as well(around 3pm or so)During our conversation before the tour and during payment I asked specifically to have fish dishes and they told me there is a lot of food and lots of fish as it is on the water. Well, they LIED again. During the tour there was barely any fish. About 1 small pieces per person. When I spoke to the \"tour guide\" and asked him to provide more fish as I didn't want to eat meat, he just ignored my request. All the food they provide is fried. So much fried food that your stomach feels bad. There was NOT ENOUGH FOOD DURING THE WHOLE TOUR. With each meal, everything was eaten to the last drop. There was simply not enough food, even if you eat everything. If you are even a bit picky, you are left hungry! We had to eat a lot of snacks(other people too) which we brought with us otherwise we would simply go hungry every day!!! There was no choice for more food. I'd gladly pay extra for fish or anything else,but you had no choice at all. Surprisingly, on the first night I saw what the crew were eating and they had bowls and bowls of fish and they had A LOT of food,including more healthier options like noodles or boiled fish( we were only getting fried stuff).In the evening our Guide told us that there will be no scheduled fishing. I don't remember if he mentioned reasons. For some reason I think the captain and the crew were too lazy. Instead of taking us fishing(and then preparing it all for us...) they were drinking vodka. I personally found it a bit unprofessional how they just sat outside and got drunk for couple of hours instead of doing what they were suppose to do and what we paid for.Boat itself is ok,but a bit old. Just like other people on Tripadvisor, we saw a big cockroach in our room,but thankfully no rats. For the same price many companies offer MUCH MUCH MUCH better facilities though. Our bathroom barely had any light inside, the fan there fell down a few hours through the stay. Shower head and the bolt that holds it to the wall was falling apart as well. As I said, not crucial,but you can have MUCH better facilities for the same price! Bring your own water and drinks or pay $3-6 for the drinks they provide.The next morning they were quick to kick us out of our cabins at 9am. We had to get our luggage upstairs. Lunch on this day was VERY small as well. After we came ashore, I ran to a restaurant at the docks to get some take out. Found some fish dishes at 25,000 dongs(about $1) per whole fish. Got 2 of those and ate them while the minibus took us to the Bai Tu Long Bay for the 2nd part of the tour - Another big scam \"Fisherman's overnight home stay\".On 2nd day you are on a much smaller boat with limited facilities and cleanliness. Water to wash your hands wasn't always available!! Toilet paper ran out as well a few times...Fisherman's home stay is a big scam as well. It's located on some ugly island and it's not a home,but a 16 room HOTEL(shared bathrooms). Just because family lives there, doesn't really make it a homestay. In Asia, a lot of staff lives in the hotels too,but that don't make them \"homestay\". Surprise - surprise, fisherman DID NOT HAVE ANY FISH!!!!!!! I asked if I can pay them or buy it somewhere and the guide said it would not be possible. The food was pretty bad at this place. Everything was fried and only fried. If you like to eat oil you may like what they cooked for us. It was quite bad! next morning I woke up early and walked to a local market and saw a lot of fish for sale.....Again, Ethnic Tours failed to communicate food requests and Guide( very useless, don't think he did anything other than translating and telling us where and when to go) failed to help when I asked him AGAIN to have fish. I mean come on, fisheman's homestay with no fish?!?! As I said, it is a big scam. This guide actually told me that it was a homestay 25 years ago,but since then the \"fisherman\" got very rich and built this 16 room hotel for tourists. What a trap!!On the way back home, we were late again everywhere, waiting for our mini bus and then staying for 30 minutes at that tourist trap shop. None of us wanted that and we just stayed by the car waiting for our \"guide\" and driver to comeback to the car. All of that very unprofessional.I had very high expectations of these tours and I spent quite a bit of money for 2 of us for 2 of these tours. I would Absolutely NOT recommend Ethnic Travel Tours to anyone. They are Scammers and liars. Please find better options out there. I regret I booked them for 2 of these tours."

Boat trip was very relaxing with lots of Vietnamese food, kayaking on the way out was ok but not super exciting if you are used to ocean kayaking. During the whole trip at sea and on the island we met no other tourists, would be different in summer when lots of Vietnamese tourists go to the island.Beach was beautiful for swimming. Over all, highly recommended if you can bare the minibus transfer from Hanoi, close to 5 hours one way."

We booked the night before leaving. Pick up was fairly late and the driver spoke zero English. Moderate amount of chaos once arriving in Halong Bay trying to sort out who was on which tour. Very poor organization thereHowever, the rest of the trip was amazing! One afternoon and morning in Halong Bay with very comfortable rooms on the boat overnight. Kayaking excursions were short and our kayak had a large crack through the middle which leaked a lot. After insisting on a bailing bucket the kayak was relatively safe, though not really sea worthy. The other kayaks were fine an it is beautiful to see the scenery abit closer up.Second day we arrived back at Halong Bat and drove to Tu Long Bay. Equally beautiful scenery and no other tourists! Five hour boat ride to an island where you cycle to a homestay and have a cooking lesson. Back to Hanoi on the third afternoon. Other than the initial chaos and the leaking kayak the trip was very much worthwhile and great value for money. The guides were mostly helpful and willing to discuss Vietnamese culture in detail. As long as you have a bit of flexibility and trust that things will eventually work out, this is definitely a great trip."

The first day of the tour was supposed to be a trip to Ha Long Bay but due to the weather conditions, this was changed.The change of plans ran smoothly and our guide kept us updated all of the time.The homestay was enjoyable and the food was really good. Getting up to see the fish market at 5am is a good idea - it's where the locals do their shopping.The bikes weren't in great condition but you only cycle for a short distance (10km max maybe) and get to stop at a beach for a swim.The boat for the overnight stay was clean, the food was very good on board and there was plenty of it. The rooms were a reasonable size too and were comfortable.On the sunny boat journey back to Ha Long Bay, I'd say I witnessed some of the best scenery that I've ever saw (possibly because it's the most recent memory but we've saw a lot of nice places over the years and this will be hard to beat).The final point is the guide that we had - he was very friendly, knowledgeable and seemed to enjoy what he was doing.

Overall, it was very good - we were collected on time, the driving time was as advertised and there was very little waiting around - once we reached the harbour we were straight on the boat and away without much hanging about.The boat was pretty nice (although I have a couple of criticisms below) and the food the crew served was excellent - much better than I had been expecting. The guides too (we were with Lily and Mu) are fantastic - funny, cheeky and very knowledgeable and with good English.Of course, the reason you go to the bays is for the scenery, and that certainly didn't disappoint. The landscapes are amazing and there are plenty of activities (kayaking, caving and swimming) to get you up close to the places you are visiting. I particularly enjoyed the kayaking and the kayaks we were given were of a good standard (although a German couple on the trip said theirs had been taking on water). The \"home stay\" on the island was also a good experience, although the \"cooking classes\" which are advertised in the itinerary are really just an exercise in chopping and learning how to roll up a spring roll.My only criticisms are:1) The system of bedroom allocation on the boat is pot-luck and we, unfortunately, ended up with the cabin next to the engine. It wasn't too noisy (I always carry earplugs and they drowned out the worst of it), but at about three in the morning I had to get up and open the cabin window because the room was full of exhaust fumes. Personally, I think this bedroom should simply not be used.2) The bikes on the island are pretty shoddy and often break down. The company should provide and maintain their own bikes rather than use a supplier on the island who obviously isn't too concerned with bike maintenance.3) There wasn't enough seating on the boat for the upper deck. There should be a recliner for every passenger (WITH CUSHION!), rather than having to bring chairs up from the dining area.My top tip for travellers going on this trip would be to grab drinks and a small cooler at the harbour - they are a fraction of the price charged on the boat."

PROS:The trip was generally well organised with good transport etc. The food was amazing throughout! This was a real highlight. The homestay where you spend the night exceeded expectations - you get a decent room with a proper bathroom and a fan (though the electricity cuts off at about 6.30am). We got to make our own spring rolls at dinner which was good fun. The activities were great - kayaking, swimming, cycling and hill walking. The guide was friendly and knowledgeable. Though he did take photos of the girls in their bikinis on his phone at one point which was inappropriate. CONS:The journey to Bai Tu Long took us 5.5 to 6 hours, which is much longer than advertised! There's a lot of driving!The pricing does not seem to be transparent, which is a shame for an agency which presents itself as a professional outfit - we paid the full advertised rate while others on our trip said they paid $10 less. The bikes are pretty dodgy - most don't have working brakes and the chain of one of the them broke halfway through the ride. Please upgrade these Ethnic!Overall I'd recommend!"

I don't particularly like organized tours and I use them only when I don't have enough time to explore a place, but in this case it was definitely fun. I decided to go to Ba Tu Long Bay instead of Halong Bay to avoid the hordes of tourist and the piles of rubbish that you often hear about, and indeed Ethnic Travels managed to take us where you can hardly see any other tourist, including the overnight (home)stay on Quan Tan island. Food was always good, kayaking and cycling were enjoyable. I just did not like the drive back to Hanoi, because of the driver and the useless stop to the typical vietnamese tourist-trap service area/souvenir shop.As for Ba Be National Park, that was the right tour to experience a little bit of Vietnamese life in the mountains/countryside. Ethnic Travels took me even if I was the only participant for that day. So I had a driver (very good this time) and guide all for myself. I enjoyed everything, from the food along the way to the walks, the homestay, trekking, cycling, lakes, caves, jungle, rice fields, etc.. Ethnic Travels' prices are not much different from the average, I would say. I could have bargained a little according to some other customers, but I didn't feel like doing it, also because I had already got a price for Ba Tu Long Bay that was lower than the one advertised on the website. A special mention for the guides: I had two young and friendly guides who are doing their work very well.In general this is a recommendable agency and their tours are really less conventional and take you a little closer to real Vietnam than most of the others."

I am terribly late in writing this review (it was actually Nov. 2012 but I could only select back to 2013) but we did the 5-day Ha Giang tour. It was worthwhile to visit this region- the landscape is stunning and to observe the way of life up there was a great experience that I look back on fondly. That said, I have a couple of caveats with the Ethnic Travel tour. First, there is a LOT of driving, and they overpromise the amount of hiking/trekking that you do. While the itinerary had one sceheduled for every day, we only did one half-day hike. It was great, but we were really hoping (and expecting) to do more of that. But the roads are slow going and there just isn't time. The company needs to be more realistic and upfront about this or change the tour to a more appropriate length of time (e.g., 7 days). Second, we reserved the tour well in advance and requested a couple of specific guides who we had been recommended from other travellers. These recommended guides were fluent in Hmong. We were assured- multiple times- that we would either be given one of these guides or another fluent in Hmong if they weren't available. We ended up with someone completely different who was not conversant in Hmong- she was very sweet and enthusiastic, but not knowing the local language limited our interaction with the residents (some spoke Vietnamese, but definitely not all). Again, our guide did the best she could and our driver was great. The homestay outside Ha Giang was really cool. The tour could just be improved- knowing what we do now I probably would have elected to go to the Sapa region instead as you could do more within that timeframe, or cut short other parts of our trip to spend longer in Ha Giang."

We arrived at Ethnic Travel at 8am and then departed with a group of 10 others by bus for Ba Tu Long Bay. Upon arriving at the bay, we boarded a boat and spent several hours exploring Ba Tu Long Bay - both in the junk boat and in tandem kayaks - and then journeyed to an island village for a 1-night homestay. We had expected an authentic homestay, but it turned out to be a guesthouse without the amenities of a guesthouse - we stayed in a large home owned by a family that worked for Ethnic Travel. They served us dinner as well and had a \"cooking class\" for us. But the \"cooking class\" consisted of them providing us with spring roll mix and rice paper, and our job was to roll the spring rolls (literally). After the homestay, we biked about 10 km to a beach and swam for a while before biking back to the boat and getting on the boat. We later switched boats to a larger boat with individual sleeper cabins and spent the night on that boat in Ha Long Bay. The following morning we journeyed back to Ethnic Travel. Overall, the trip was excellent. Our guide - Van - was fantastic. She was knowledgeable and super nice. The food was very good as well, particularly on the first boat. The only reason for the 4-stay versus 5-star review was that the homestay was not great. But I would highly recommend the trip nonetheless. It's a great way to see and experience Ha Long Bay and quite affordable for what you get throughout the trip - kayaking, biking, boat trip, good food, etc."

Also, the organisation in general is great; they even chartered an earlier ride back to Ha Noi so that another guest could catch a bus to Sa Pa. Also, they had to deal with a messed up schedule due to a Typhoon having closed down Ha Long bay a couple of days earlier and they did so very professionally, e.g. by chartering additional boats. In the end, they even paid our taxi to the train station.The so-sos: You get what you pay for; and if you are a city-dweller, a homestay in Vietnam might be something to have another thought about, however comfortable it is. The family was great, there was a shower and it was clean, we just hardly slept that night because we're real city-dwellers. We would probably do it again though for the experience.The downs: The Ethnic Travel boat in Bai Tu Long bay is not comfortable. You will stay on the boat for a couple of hours, but the chairs will make your back hurt in minutes. Also, there were not enough non-alcoholic beverages to last the whole trip.All in all we would however recommend to go with Ethnic Travel, particularly because they are professional and have a great attitude towards the people of Vietnam!"

Our guide was amazing and so entertaining. We loved the homestays and exploring the villages in the Sapa valley. This tour is REALLY off the beaten track. Things that we were concerned about though was that the tour operator, Ethnic travel Vietnam, seemed to leave buying the train tickets until the last minute (just before the train left). We figured that this was the cheaper way of doing things, but we had booked MONTHS in advance and this had us worried, particularly at the end of the tour when we were worried that we would not get back to Hanoi! We also heard that the company is not ethically responsible and doesn't invest any of their profits back into the hill tribe communities (even though they tell their staff that they will).Keep in mind that:* There is only one person in their office that speaks fluent English & French, the others have very limited language* The night train is a rough ride. Take a light sleeping bag or inner to sleep in on the train. Also take ear plugs and an eye mask. You will be sharing your cabin with locals.* In Sapa, particularly when we went at the beginning of July, wear/take gumboots, otherwise known as rubber boots, wellingtons, plastic rain shoes. These are the only shoes that hold up while you hike (scramble, slide, slip) in the mud. And there is LOTS of mud! * Whilst hiking, ask your guide to cut or find a bamboo walking stick for you- we would've fallen over a hundred times if not for these."

During our visit to the north of Vietnam we had the good fortune of booking our trips with Ethnic Travel.We went on a 2-day trip to Mai Chau and a 2-day trip to Cuc Phuong.I can't fault them for anything. Great guides(good english), great accomodation and most importantly great experience. Their objective is to create the most authentic(and thus not too touristic) experience. They did not only succeed in their objective but they went above and beyond to accomodate us(they booked a cheap and good taxi and flight for us).Before deciding on Ethnic travel we considered 4 other operators. Ethnic travel was the cheapest among them.Good price, great experience. We recommend them !"

After we had met people in Sapa who were travelling with ethnic Travel, we decided to book the halong bay / bai tu long bay and the ninh bin tour with them. Total was 4 nights and 5 days. Our guide Ha was the really good, friendly and worked extremely hard!The bai tu long bay trip included kayaking, swimming, a bycicle ride and was very nice. They had told us we would sleep with 'a local family', but is was more of a (not too expensive) hotel than a cultural experience. Good was really good!The Halong Bay tour was nice as well, but we has bas luck with the weather. The room on the boat was ok, altough the shower could have worked better. Note that the prices for drinks on this boat (especially for water) are outrageous ... 20.000 dong for 0.5 liter ... So take your own water! Food on this boat was less good than at other places.The nin binh tour was also really nice and it looked like on the pictures. We went on a rowing boat with a local woman rowing. Enjoyable experience. However we felt uneasily when the rowing lady eequested a tip and was clearly unhappy with 20.000 dong. In our opinion, ethnic travel should give the tips since they know better what is expected.Conclusion: we can recommend ethnic travel, as long as you don't expect a luxurious hotel. We hope you will have such a good and motivated guide as we did. Special thanks to Ha!!"

            "review": "Generally excellent.. I booked onto the 3 day 2 night Halong Bay/Bai Tu Long Bay trip as a solo traveller. They recommended this trip above the solely Halong Bay trip as Bai Tu Long bay offers a bit more and is much more off the beaten track. I was hesitant at first but very glad I went with this and would hugely recommend to anyone else.Met on time and transferred to Halong Bay. A bit of hanging around before boarding the boat although that seemed to be the case for everyone but when we did we were met with a delicious and plentiful lunch - fresh food cooked very well. The boat was nice: spacious, clean and sufficiently equipped. Ethnic Travel really make an effort to get off the beaten track so we travelled for a long time deep amongst the islands of Halong but in doing so managed to lose most of the fellow tourist boats for the rest of the afternoon and evening which involved kayaking around a floating village. The next day we were transferred north onto another boat in Bai Tu Long bay. Immediately it was obvious that this wasn't as touristy and the dock we boarded the boat from was actually a fishing dock, with loads of people at work. From the minute we left the harbour to the minute we returned I didn't see another tourist or tourist boat that wasn't with Ethnic Travel. It was far more serene and you got a chance to experience the natural beauty a little more without the obstruction of noise and action of other boats. The surroundings are pretty similar in both Halong and BaiTuLong so really enjoyed this bit and getting away from it all. Kayaking also good in both locations (oyster farm second time round). That night we stayed in a homestay. Naturally it's pretty basic and if you go in with that mindset then it is very enjoyable. The family are really nice and welcoming (so much so that I met up with one of them in Hanoi and he gave me a free tour and we went out together). People have said that the bikes are pretty dodgy, which they are, but if you embrace that and accept that it's hardly a developed island where you're staying then it's really not that bad, especially considering you don't have to cycle that far. One thing that I'd highly recommend is the food market in the morning which is very near to the homestay. It does involve getting up at about 5.30am but as a one off experience to see the day to day life it is very interesting.After a good trip all round sadly the company was let down by one of their drivers who drove particularly recklessly on the return leg. He refused to let someone stop to get out and was driving pretty dangerously. That said, on complaining back at the office (which everyone in the bus did) they offered to arrange us all a transfer to the airport/train station/etc and handled the situation very well.Overall, not the cheapest trip on the market but certainly not the most expensive, and also for the fact you get off the beaten track and get to experience some different things I'd very much recommend this trip. Mu, one of the guides was also fantastic.Positives: food, guides (Mu especially), office staff, Bai Tu Long bay, host familyNegatives: transfers/driving"

The tour itself was good; nice double room on the boat, good scenery and excellent food. However, it was our tour guide Dat (unsure of spelling) which took our tour from good to fantastic. He was a lovely young Vietnamese man with an excellent grasp of English and a real desire to please all the guests. Very polite, informative and friendly 24/7 which really improved the tour. If you are considering a tour with Ethnic travel, ask for Dat!"

            "review": "amazing time!. After reading several blogs about travelling in Vietnam we came across a positive review of Ethnic travel and we emailed them back and forth prior to our trip. Very quick to respond, they occasionally forgot to answer some of our specific questions but, overall, the booking process was really easy.We initially booked a 3 day, 4 night trip to Sapa with Etnic and the punchline here is that we had an amazing time and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for a reputable tour operator for your travelling in Vietnam.The only minor hiccup that we had was transitioning through Lao Cai after the night train from Hanoi. Whereas there were tons of people there with name-signs for many other tourists on the train, there was no one there to meet us in Lao Cai. In the early morning pouring rain we were still standing there, alone, after everyone else had been met. A bit of a confusing and disconcerting feeling at 6am. Beyond this, it hadn't really been made clear to us that Sapa itself, it about a 30-40min bus ride from the Lao Cai train station. Ultimately, it all worked out and someone came and found us and put us on a bus of other visitors to Sapa where we were taken to the Sapa Hostel for a shower after which our guide, Vivi, came and found us. We also had a bit of similar confusion on the transition back to the train station through Lao Cai where we didn't really understand where we were getting our train tickets from...but it all worked out.We had an amazing three days of trekking with Vivi who was a universally positive and helpful guide full of knowledge about the area. We were very sad to leave her at the end. We homestayed with Vivi's family on the first night and then had a hotel in Sapa (the beyond amazing Cat Cat View which I will try to find the time to review separartely) on the 2nd night.After our fantastic Sapa trip we decided to stick with Ethnic for our time in Halong Bay. After reading trip reviews of Cat Ba island and less than great things about various homestays we wanted to have both nights on the boat. Imagine our amazement when we had an entire boat to ourselves with 5 or 6 crew for 3 days. Contrary to what I have read in other reviews, Ethnic does have a couple of its own boats...I guess that when it's really busy they might contract out to other boats? I'm not sure. But we were on an Ethnic boat which had 6 cabins and we were the only ones aboard. Wonderful!Anyway, nothing negative to say. We had amazing times in both Sapa and Halong Bay with Ethnic and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them."

            "review": "Fantastic tours!. We did the 3 day Sapa trek and the Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay joined trips. These tours made our Vietnam experience! We had very little information from Ethnic Travel about these tours. Having been dropped off in Sapa by the bus, after an overnight train journey and fairly long transfer, to find no tour guide (she did turn up eventually) and then to find out it would be just the pair of us and the guide trekking into the mountains for 3 days, rather than a group as we'd hoped, made for a slightly shaky start. However, I would not have changed these circumstances for the world. Our guide was the most lovely lady and as there was only the 3 of us we were about to ask each other all the questions we wanted and talked about everything under the sun. There are other people trekking similar routes so you do tend to see people you recognise and can chat to at the rest stops. Our first night was spent at our guides house. She and her family put us up and cooked us the most delicious food we tasted the whole trip (and that's saying something). It was more than comfortable for us after a hard days trekking. The second night we stayed at a different homestay with a large family and another tourist who had been trekking the same route with his guide. Again the food was phenomenal and it was easy to sleep. Interaction with the family was around the table during dinner and was fun despite the language barrier. Despite the misty mornings, we were really lucky with the weather and it was sunshine and blue skies until the final day when after 32ish km of trekking we were collected by mini bus just as the rain started. The weather really did make a huge difference between our experience and that of others we met who had not been so lucky. Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay were 2 trips combined. 2 different guides and some changes to the people in the group on the tours. Also wonderful trips. The accommodation was brilliant and the food was delicious. Ethnic Travel have their own boat for the Halong Bay overnight trip and that's a real bonus looking at the condition of some of the other tour boats. We shared the trips with a lovely group of people. The kayaking was probably my highlight, but all in all it was a wonderful trip. One recommendation - when on the Bai Tu Long Bay trip take mosquito repellant. The cycle from the beach to the homestay is a dusk and you will be grateful for it at that point. Basically, all in all it was a completely wonderful experience. Recommended."

In reality this was 2 separate tours joined by a minibus transfer, hence two tour guides and a changeover of travel companions. Both tour guides were pleasant young ladies who spoke good English.Overall a very enjoyable 3 days. Both bays are spectacularly beautiful: Bai Tu Long Bay is also very quiet. The cycling, kayaking and swimming were all good, although the bikes would benefit from some maintenance. The Homestay was OK, but really is more of a bed and breakfast with a 20 minute spring roll making lesson thrown in. Genuine interaction with the family was minimal.The overnight stay on the boat in Halong Bay was enjoyable, with a hospitable crew and good food. We didn't find the drinks prices excessive.We suspected that the itinerary was driven, at least to an extent, by the logistics of bussing the various groups of clients to/from and between the tours. In our case this worked quite well and we were back in Hanoi by 4pm, a couple of hours earlier than anticipated.Overall Ethnic Travel did a good job and seem committed to their ethos of sustainable tourism but we think their web site could make the fact that this is not a single cohesive tour clearer: and perhaps describe the Homestay component in a more realistic way."

            "review": "Not the tour we expectedv- Halong and Bai Tu Long Bay. Firstly I must confess that we didn't choose this company, our hotel did after the tour we booked of Bai Tu Long Bay was cancelled. It was not of the same standard as our tour but I did get a chance to read previous reviews and I thought like Sorcha I should rate the tour on pros and Cons. Ultimately I decided to take us on this trip and could have shopped around if I thought that it was going to be bad, which it wasn't but its not a 5 star experience either. Pros - The people who travelled with us. They were like minded, really great to talk to and made the tour so to speak.Bai Tu Long Bay - yay no boats. I know that may seem a little shallow, but I was so sick of looking at other fancy tourist boats, and I may have had a little bit of envy.Home stay and spring roll cooking - Bai Tu Long Bay. this was so much fun, and like others have mentioned the food on this tour is really good.Scenery - get up really early whilst in Halong Bay - I took some really good shots and the hazy mist had lifted.Bai Tu Long Bay Guide - she was really nice, her English was great and the 'what's happening next' were carried out.Bai Tu Long Bay accommodation was really nice even with the cold shower. Power goes out at 10pm. Remember you insect repellent. Also the drinks here are reasonable priced. You can get a coffee from the hotel opp the home stay alley way. ConsThe Boats - no power points working, no fans and no a/c. Made for a very sticky nights sleep. The rooms are very simple and everything feels damp. There were also a lot of broken life jackets.Drinks are sooooo expensive!! And the coffee or tea is chargeable. Remember to bring water with you as it is a $1US per bottle (500mls) on the boat.Return time. Would have been good to have had the guides agree with their office in Hanoi. A small freak out when they told me we wouldn't be back until 7pm. Freaking out because they said it would be 5pm at their office and we had a train to catch.No chance for squid fishing and I had to stay on the boat because the guide thought I was too big for a kayak - I'm not, and proved it later, but the promised row boat never came.I don't think this is great value, but it's not a waste of money either.The trip starts with a van ride to Halong Bay approx. 4 hours with a break in between which lasts about 20mins. At Halong Bay we had to wait about an hour for our tour guide. Toilets here cost $2K. remember to take some water as all drinks on the boats are ridiculously priced!!After Halong Bay tour you will wait between 40mins and 1.5hours for the pick up for the next part of the tour which is a 1.5 hour drive to Bai Tu Long Bay. You then head out on a Sampan (can buy drinks here on the boat) to the island were you will be staying. The bike ride was a heap of fun but two bikes didn't have brakes and we ended up cycling in the dark (not recommend) as we had way to long on the beach. Suggest if you are getting in late, cut back the beach look by 15mins.Homestay and spring roll lesson was fantastic. Catch a Tuk Tuk to the boat the next day, head out to go kayaking around a mussel farm, then back to Bai Tu Long bay and the crazy drive home. I recommend that you avoid looking up. I completed this tour with my 14 year old niece who loved it all, except the food. She isn't a big fan of seafood"

You go back to the harbour and are transferred to another harbour by bus for bai tu long bay. Save money on drink by buying a big bottle of water for time at sea.

We ended up booking Halong Bay with them as well. The first day of Halong bay was just like everyone else's tours. The bay is full of boats and pretty polluted, but was still lovely.

            "review": "Almost amazing, but some sloppy mistakes let them down.. I've just returned from a two night, three day trip to Ha Long Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay with Ethnic Travel. I booked the trip from home about a month in advance and they were quick, efficient and friendly on email. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Ha Long Bay as you hear so much about the crowds, pollution and noise, but Ethnic Travel took us to quieter spots and while of course you see other boats it didn't seem congested. We stopped at some lovely spots for kayaking and swimming and the place we spent the night had a couple of other boats but was peaceful. The boat was great! Not super shiny new as some you see, but if you're with Ethnic Travel then you're probably not the sort of traveler that wants white table cloths and a disco on board like some boats had. The cabins were really lovely and the showers hot and powerful. The absolute nightlight was the food. Amazing! Really delicious and so much of it. I can't believe the crew cook up meals like that in their tiny kitchen. In the past reviewers have complained about the price of drinks...it is a little odd that you have to pay for tea, coffee and water but the beer and coke didn't seem expensive at all. Solo travellers are expected to double up in twin rooms - which almost all of our group was happy with but they don't tell you about this at the time of booking so if that's a problem for you then consider this when booking.Day two was Bai Tu Long Bay. Cruising around the bay during the day was lovely. It's absolutely beautiful. There was more kayaking and swimming and this time we really were the only ones. However,he real disappointment from this trip was the island homestay and this bit really does let the whole trip down. I think most people have an expectation of a homestay as being a bit more of a personal experience where you spend time with the family and learn a bit more about homie/culture etc. This homestay would be better described as a B&B...and a not very friendly one at that. The family didn't seem especially happy to have us, but the biggest problem was that the single travellers were expected to not only share a room (fine) but to share a double bed (not fine!). When we protested the family were clearly unhappy about this, despite there being more than enough rooms. For some reasons two travellers were put in a separate house (only next door) which was odd when there were rooms in the main house. The dinner at the homestay is dreadful. Every fried, oily and tasteless. Not what you would expect from an island surround ped by delicious fish.The final day of the trip involved a bike ride to a beach. The bikes were past their sell-by date (we're not talking a little rusty, we're talking people having to fix their own chains and being given bikes with no brakes) and the ride was very disappointing. If you're expecting a picturesque ride to see island life then readjust that...the majority of our ride was along a bumpy 'building site' as they are putting a major new road on the island. We only had 30 or 40 minutes at the beach.This last bit of the trip was such a shame as overall Ethnic Travel were so good. I would recommend them as a tour operator (even just for the cute cabins and amazing food on board) but I'd really recommend they sort out their room allocation issues and the quality of the island section soon or they could start losing custom."

Rather than looking through a million agencies on the web, we decided to ask around to see who had a good tip. A colleague shared her good experience with this agency and I can only confirm the value of the agency, the tour. I have no real base of comparison of course, but the price was correct. Communication with the staff was easy. Our guide was very nice. Knowledgeable and available, but also discreet. The tour was delivered as advertised & sold. Excellent food. The trip felt like being \"off the beaten track\", since a slightly different route was taken. Other travelers in our group had used their services for trips to Sapa and confirmed all of the above."

            "review": "Great guide and great sights but unrealistic itinerary meant lack of trekking. We did the 9 day northern explorer up to ba be national park, to cao bang province, down to bai tu long bay and then down to halong bay. First of all we will look back on our trip and remember it as a good thing, we had great company in the other customers and made some new friends, a wonderful guide in Dom (who was funny, knowledgeable and really helpful), the smiliest driver in Ling and a very modern minivan with just the 6 of us able to tackle some ridiculous roads with relative ease. Unfortunately there were some downsides regarding the itinerary on the website vs the reality: The itinerary listed on the website is unrealistic, driving times were in reality 2 or 3 hours longer than suggested and therefore the trekking time and distances listed on the website for each day were either halved or non existent. Such unrealistic and out of touch itineraries put unfair pressure on the tour guides and drivers to attempt to deliver a tour that cannot possibly match the customers' expectations of what has been advertised. So what should have been a tour involving 59kms of trekking over the 9 days (as quoted by the website - impossible) instead saw 4 enjoyable treks lasting just 9 hours in total, through dense jungle, rainforest, rice paddies, beautiful farmland and small villages. The sights were great: ba be lake was a massive highlight and the trek through cao bang was brilliant, we just wish the trekking had been a lot longer! Basically just be careful you are getting what you pay for, the more popular trips (halong bay) are more polished and are therefore better value. Don't bother with bai tu long bay- as others have said its a building sight"

Couple in our 50's, we booked an 8 days highlights of Vietnam tour in advance on the net.Replies to our queries were answered promptly, we were picked up from the airport on arrival as arranged.The hotel was nice, our tour guide very knowledgeable, friendly and showed us Hanoi and she even had a great taste in food - the restaurant she took us for lunch was really good. In the evening we took the overnight train to Sapa. Thanks goodness we paid extra to have the 4 sleeper for the 2 of us. Its a bit tight for 4 people. train is noisy and the hygiene is questionable.The sleeper cabins are air conditioned that's good but very noisy. don't expect to sleep much.Sapa 2 days trekking with local guide was very nice, Hotel we stayed at was pleasant with magnificent views to the mountains.Halong Bay trip on the boat was relaxing, weather was not the best but we still enjoyed it.The food on the boat was remarkable. We had a great selection of fresh seafood, presented in flamboyant style, looked and tasted amazing. 5*Our homestay accommodation in Ninh Binh was unfortunately below our expectation. We did not expect a 5* hotel, but the state of the bathroom and the cleanliness of the bed sheets could be improved on.Food was fine.Overall impression about the travel agency is good, their guides are excellent, friendly and know their country well. The manager of the office was helpful and seeking feedback from us to assist him in his aim to provide continuous improvement to his customers.We highly recommend this tour to young travellers and couples who wish to discover how everyday people live in Vietnam. Its an eye opener."

I knew they were supposed to be beautiful and ethereal and all that, because the guide books so say, but I was not prepared for the gravity of their reality, and Ethnic Travel made sure that nothing got in the way of our being crushed by the spellbinding surreality of the experience.I have no doubt we would have been blown away by the Bays anyway, but our tour guide, Mua, took what might have merely been a memorable experience and made it one of the top travel experiences of our lives. When we relive this trip we'll talk about Mua as much (or possibly more) than the bays themselves.The experience was basically flawless from travel to accommodations and, especially, the food. There was so... much... food, and my wife and I are vegetarian. We pushed ourselves at every meal lest any of our delectable food go un-savored.Oh, and seriously, if you go to Ha Long Bay you absolutely must go to Bai Tu Long Bay. Ha Long is really just a great set up to fully appreciate Bai Tu Long."

            "review": "Good service, well-run company. We booked the 3 day, 2 night Halong Bay/Bai Tu Long Bay tour, and the experience was good overall. The first part of the tour involved sailing out into Halong Bay and spending a night on the boat. I think we had underestimated just how busy Halong Bay would be. Despite the weather being pretty bad at this time of year (rainy and too foggy to see much), there were literally thousands of people waiting to board various tour boats. There were quite a variety of boats in the harbour, and Ethnic Travel uses their own boats which seem well-maintained. Our room far exceeded our expectations, as it was much nicer than it had looked in the photos they showed. The food on the boat was plentiful and artfully presented, and vegetarians were accommodated. Flavours were a bit lacking, but this was made up for by the variety, quantity, and excellent temperature of the food. Drinks are not included, and were extremely marked up (about twice as high as restaurant prices), so we didn't buy any. Our guide, Mu, was extremely knowledgeable and had a wicked sense of humour. She could answer virtually any question and we could tell she wanted us to have a great experience. We had a bit of an issue that evening: we had been told we would be in a very quiet bay where no other boats would be anchored and instead found that there were in fact many boats in the same area, followed by Ethnic Travel's other boat actually rafting to us so that all we could hear was their generator and when we looked out our bedroom window we could see straight into their kitchen! Waking up to look out our bedroom window into a kitchen, instead of out onto a tranquil bay, was not what we had in mind when we booked the tour! We, and others, protested to Mu that we did not want to stay rafted to the other boat all night (which was clearly their intention), and after a brief argument, she was able to convince them to detach the boat (thank you, Mu!). The second day of the tour involved a transfer by minibus to another boat in Bai Tu Long Bay, which we much preferred to Halong Bay as we did not see any other tourists there, and it was a lot quieter! The food on this boat was amazing! Tasty, hot, and never-ending! Drinks were much more reasonably priced on this boat, so we were happy to buy a few beers with our meals. Our guide, Nga, was perhaps not as knowledgeable as Mu, but she certainly made up for it with her enthusiasm and friendliness! The night in the homestay was also really good.Friendly family, quiet room, great spring rolls (which we helped to make), and really tasty dinner as well. We were able to visit a small market and local temple in the little town which were nice since they were not at all touristy.In terms of value, Halong Bay tours in general are extremely overpriced, so go in with low expectations and prepared to spend a lot of money! That said, Ethnic Travel's prices are comparable to other companies in Hanoi, and they offer options which are a bit off the beaten track, so it would be worth spending a few extra dollars to book with them.Overall, we were very satisfied with our tour and would not hesitate to recommend this company.Tip: Water is NOT included on these tours (though they do give you some on the bus on the way to Halong Bay), so you may want to consider bringing a large bottle or two so you won't have to buy tiny bottles at high prices!"

What an amazing travel company it was. We originally booked a tour to Sapa where we stayed with families up in the mountains for 3 nights and 4 days, we loved everything about it so went back and booked Halong Bay and another homestay in a small fishing village in mid Vietnam. Ethnic travel never let us down. From picking us up at our hotel, providing our tickets for our overnight train, arranging pickup at the other end to arranging flights within the country, we were treated with kindness and respect through out the whole trip...My Son.and Hoi Ann trips were arranged through Ethnic Travel and our accomodations were beautiful. Our guides have become our friends and since arriving home we have stayed in touch with them....Thankyou to Ethnic Travel for all you did for us with making our adventure the perfect one for two women in their 50's and our \"my adult daughter\" Your kindness was sincere, our worries were none while in your capable hands.Pat Suzie and Rebecca, Ontario Canada"

Given all the reviews about bad boats for inflated prices that you hear about most Halong Bay tours, we found the Ethnic Travel boat well kitted out and in good shape. The mattress was a little strange (covered in plastic) but was reasonably comfortable, and the cabin was nice and clean! The tour itself could perhaps have been a little more informative but we got the opportunity each day to get out on a kayak to get an up close view of one of the fishing villages and then also a karst cave. The Mai Chau tour was great, including two nights in two different home stays. The guide, Chi, was excellent - she told us about the villages we were passing through, explained the kind of working life the villagers have with growing rice and raising buffalo explained some of their traditions and beliefs and also told us about her own experience of growing up in Sapa doing similar work. It was great to have a guide who was so friendly and also open to talking from experience! The group was only very small, including only us and a French family of 3. We had a lovely time and would definitely recommend the tour (provided you are up for a reasonable amount of walking as we did around 30km in a day and a half!). I think because the tours are in such small groups it is possible to request alternative activities if walking long distances isn't your thing though!"

We have just seen a few other boats because we went to a very quiet bay. In Sapa I was the only one. The guide and me took a very quiet path through the mountains and rice fields while we saw hundreds of tourists on the other side of the river. The homestays were great. My guide left at night to stay in her own house so I was left with the couple and watched Vietnamese television with them. This was a really homestay while I have experienced many other homestays what actually were kind of inns.The only point to mention about Ethnic travel is that their communication via email is not good. They don't understand your questions and give wrong answers. You should call or visit them. Their English is good when speaking so then there's no problem."

It has started at the agency, where an agent has explained in detail what we were signing up for and how the trip was organised , very clearly, in a very good english. As the employees have heard us speaking french, one of them has spontaneously offered he explanation in french. We were offered a cup of tea with a pastery, and answered all of our questions, which was very pleasent.and reassuring.On the D day our guide, Mu, came to our hotel to warn us the bus was coming to pick us up in 10 minutes. Exactly 10 minutes later the bus was waiting for us at our hotel.For us the 3 days we have spent with Ethnic Travel were all about punctuality, perfect service, delicate attentions, delicious food, and most importantly: wonderfull insight to beatiful Vietnam, out of beaten paths. Our boat has brought our group of 8 people from the pear to the heart of the Along bay, with no other boats around, and we were amazed by the breathtaking beauty of this journey. We have visited a floating village and spent the night on our boat, in a cosy and well decorated cabin. It is worth mentionning that we have been served during the whole trip amazing food in such generous portions we couldn't finish it all... The next day we have done some kayaking early in the morning and came back to the Along pear around noon. We were the only couple to continue the trip to the Bai Tu Long bay, and Ethnic Travel has pursued the tour as if we were a group: no cuts, no changes, just as it was planned. We have discovered the beautiful and much less touristic Bai Tu Long bay, almost as beautiful as the Along bay, and we were alone on the boat. In the afternoon we have arrived to the Van Don island. We did around an hour of cycling across the very nice and peacefull island and have arrived to M. Sau's homestay, where we have been learned to cook spring rolls (and have eaten another enormous and delicious dinner) and have spent the night at M.Sau's house. Next day the return to the pear was very nice too, with a tour of kayaking around an oyster farm, -again, all alone in the middle of the beautiful bay. All 3 days were wonderful, and we want to say a special THANK YOU to our fantastic guide, Mu, who was not only super organised, but also has learned us so many things about Vietnam and it's culture and knew how to answer all of our questions.We would definitely recommend Ethnic Travel !"

The helpful lady said \"they're not luxury, but they're really nice.\" And after being pedalled the \"our boats are the best in the bay\" this was really refreshing and actually made us trust them more. The route to other boats is different also, mooring away from the busy areas.We were met by none other than the boss of Ethnic Travel at our hotel who apologised for being late and took us to the minibus pickup point. We were very fortunate to have a small group (only 5 of us!) on the tour. Our guide, the amazing Chee, gave us information as we travelled about districts and Vietnamese life.The boat was exactly as described, not luxurious but really lovely and tastefully decked out completely in bamboo! En suites, amazing views and clean rooms! The food was seriously good - lots of fresh seafood and, for the two vegetarians, a good spread of variety!Our journey took us away from the mass of boats (there's hundreds!!) and to a quieter floating village, then a slow trip to our final mooring. The sea was cold (don't believe Chee!!!) but refreshing. If Chee is your guide, ask her to sing some Back Street Boys/Ronan Keating and make music from a leaf! She was a brilliant guide and very informative.Kayaking the following morning was brilliant and well organised.Definitely the most honest tour in the bay - their \"no frills/luxury\" is like paradise to backpackers and the whole trip felt more involved and thought out. A huge recommendation from us, and the rest of the group on our boat!!Dom & Sal"

I travel solo but found myself joined up with a most pleasant French couple. ET provided them a French speaking guide. I also speak a little French, and they a little English, all from high school, so we have managed quite well to dredge up our early teachings. So far this has been a delight. I note others complain about the conditions of the roads. Hey folks, it's part of the adventure. We have had homestays in isolated villages- you don't get isolated unless you pay the price, and that means bad roads at times over high mountain passes, after which today we ended up pulling over and all of us enthustiastically helping Linh washing our filthy bus because it was fun and we finally had sun! We have stayed in two homestays and are now at our second hotel, and at all our stops we've had a great variety of dishes. Chi, my English speaking guide, has done her best to cater to my mostly fruit and veggie diet. She helps me find markets for tangerines and places to buy milk, hard to find up here. We have delightful, sometimes challenging hikes, out among the rice paddies and bike rides which take us among the tribal people where they are most happy to allow us to take photos you don't get anywhere else. The exercise balances the sometimes long drives, this time of year through heavy mist and fogs in the high country, through mud and rain, but the end product is worth it. Tribal communities where you are the minority and you stand out on the streets and people yell \"hello\" at you because they're proud they know an English word. If you're looking for something to complain about you'll find it. However if you understand that getting around up here in the North means three or four hours on bumpy roads so that you are treated to these very, very special looks at isolated and relatively untouched tribes, then this is for you. If you are so delicate that a little tooth jarring on backroads or a little wetness in your hikes is bothersome, don't do this. This is an excursion, and by that I mean that you're in for some effort. That's part of the joy, the fun, and the pleasure of this whole trip. It isn't Disney World. Hanoi is Hanoi, it stinks to get in and out of it, it's a fact of life. Factor it in. Once you're out of the pollution and start seeing the real Vietnam, you'll forget about city life and start enjoying the fat cheeked babies, the tribal costumes, sharing the road with cows, kids, bikes, buffalo, babies and mutts. And everything else that walks. Chances are you'll do what I did, too, which was when the man who owned the house we stayed the second night came to a stop by chance behind us after we left, just by chance, I jumped out of the car to run back and shake his hand. In fact. I just gave him a huge hug. We both grinned at each other, 100% happy. This is why we do this. Not to be comfortable. But to find joy."

We went on a cruise to Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay with Ethnic Travel between Dec 30th and Jan 1st (3 days, 2 nights) and although there were some positive points, the negative ones were overwhelming.Positive points:- Our guide (Hahn?) was friendly and knowledgeable, and did his best to please us, although sometimes he seemed a bit inexperienced- The food was nicely cooked and abundant but lacked variety and a vegetarian choiceNegative points:- The promised pick up from the hotel almost did not happen as the bus failed to stop and just drove by, as a result we had to run after it, which in Hanoi traffic is a treacherous experience- The road trip to Halong Bay and back was long and unpleasant, but that was mainly due to the poor state of the road and the horrendous traffic; as a result we spent over 4 hours on the road each way, probably an earlier pick up might have saved us some time, as we hit the worst traffic around Hanoi- The junk was grim and poorly maintained and the room could be described as shabby at the least- Although we had told them at the time of booking in August that we were strictly vegetarian, and had repeated them twice in December, they did not cater for us at all and kept on asking us if we ate seafood and eggs, which we don\u2019t; as a result, our diet was very monotonous (plain rice, tofu in tomato sauce, steamed leafy veggie, spring rolls), although a variety of vegetables keep emerging in all meat and fish dishes, everywhere but in the vegetarian ones \u2026- The drinks in Halong Bay were very expensive- The programme changed several times during the three days, as a result we did kayaking twice and no walking at all: the first time in halong bay in a very dangerous \u201cparking lot\u201d for cruise ships, the second time in bai tu long bay among farmed oysters, in very polluted waters; both times the kayaks were very wet inside and we ended up sitting in a puddle of water despite the cold temperature; the second time we also had to balance on a precarious stair and some thin wooden poles to get to the kayaks, which we felt was a pretty dangerous exercise (some people declined to do the kayaking for this reason)- The homestay in bai tu long bay was pleasant enough but the island we stayed on is a building site, the road work is very extensive and the tuc tuc journey was terrible (we declined to cycle and we were glad we did); they probably should look for an alternative island until the work is completed- When we came back to Ethnic Travel office on Jan 1st at almost 7 pm, we were first promised a taxi to the hotel, then we were told that our hotel was only a few minutes away and there was no taxi, then again we were asked if we needed one, by which time we had decided to make our way to the hotel on footWe were lucky enough to have good company and a good amount of enthusiasm, having just arrived in Hanoi, therefore we enjoyed our stay; but we strongly felt that the service provided was below expectations, considering the price we had paid online to book the cruise. My advice would be not to book anything ahead and to shop around in Hanoi instead, the offer is so great you will always find a place, even in high season. I wouldn\u2019t recommend Ethnic Travel, though."

I had read about this company in the Lonely Planet and decided to go with them as they claim to go to the places the other tour companies don't go to. I was looking for an authenitic experience seeing the vietnamese countryside and staying in homestays. This is exactly what I got and in 3 days, I only saw 3 other tourists. Cycling through the rice paddies and villages was beautiful and every local welcomed us by smiling and waving. The two homestays were comfortable and the food served by the families was amazing. I would highly recommend this as an alternative to visiting Saper which is apparantly rather touristy. Mai Chau is also only 3 hours or so away from Hanoi so no overnight bus required! The company staff were friendly and helpful and when I enquired about getting a bus to Cat Ba Island when I returned, they made a quick phone call and arranged for me to get a lift on their tour bus... for free!"

We had booked our trip with Ethnic travel to Halong and Bai Tu Long bay and equipped with all the things one might need and excited about what may come. The first day was quite misty and foggy, normal apparently on most days here. It was stunning to drive deeper and deeper into the maze of islands and rocks. A quick stop was made at a floating village where we were driven around in a rowing boat. Then we already stopped at our overnight place where we went for a swim. Not everyone joined, some stayed on the sun deck as lookouts for the numerous jellyfish that swam around everywhere. Wow, were we impressed. We were greeted by the staff as they were very courteous and helpful You won't be disappointed and now we only have great memories !!!"

But even so I am just not sure it works as a worthwhile trip. I am sure we were told (beforehand) that the journey from hanoi to the boat would take 3.5hrs. But as we set off it was confirmed it would take it over five. And the route is not at all scenic so it is worth considering whether that is a good use of your time. The boat we used was a bit shabby and not that comfortable. The lunch served en route was good and plentiful. We then sailed at high speed to an area for kayaking. The itinerary said 1-2 hrs. We had only 30 mins, which was fine as it turns out as the spot was not very scenic. Basically a cove with a fish farm and associated debris including lots of polystyrene. The boat then powered on through less interesting scenery for 1.5 hrs, to an island, where we were shuttled in the dark by a tuk tuk to a village to stay with a family. They were friendly enough and the room and food surpassed expectations. But basically you are staying in a one street village, and not a pretty one at that, and so having eaten dinner there is really nothing to do.The next morning we had breakfast, it was too rainy to do the planned cycle across the island and so we just made our way by tuk tuk. the island seemed to be a big building site and strewn with rubbish. We stopped at what could have been a pretty beach, but in addition to the rubbish there a constant stream of lorries was taking away the sand.We used up two days of our holiday and I can't say we really saw anything interesting..."

We had 2 guides who spoke very good English and had answer to every question. The also knew a lot about the area we walked through and told us many interesting stories.Advice to management in the office: you shouldn't ask guests to write a review while in the office - it felt really awkward, especially when you asked me to create an account.You should simply mention that you are on Trip Advisor and ask for a review upon return or in any suitable time.The tour was great, so there's no need to put customers on the spot in such way - it could have the opposite effect.Highly recommended - we'll definitely go again.Thanks again!"

The tour was well organized, we received quick email replies, and for the most part the tour ran as planned with a punctual program. Our tourguide was really friendly, Van, I can highly recommend her, with a good level of english and passion for what she does! The vehicles/boats were reliable and safe, the accomodation clean, the staff friendly, the food was great, though by the last day we were not so excited about morning glory, rice and deep-fried springrolls anymore! The tours may be slightly more pricy than what other operators offer, but it was really really worth it. It was everything it promised to be without any hidden surprises. I consider the tour to be of a high quality that I would definitely recommend further."

We chose this tour company for a trip to Ha Long and Bai Tu Long bay because they sounded very knowledgeable and reliable compared to others we spoke to. They don't visit the really busy/touristy caves in Ha Long Bay because they're too crowded. They explained the various trip options in great detail with no pressure on whether we chose any or not. They re-arranged the itinerary of one of the trips to accommodate our onward travel plans. The group sizes are limited to 14 people. Our guide (Mu) was very funny, friendly and helpful. The poor weather prevented us from setting sail in Bai Tu Long bay so the company arranged for us to stay in a local hotel and eat in a local restaurant (this was at no extra cost). Instead of sailing out to the bay they arranged for us to visit a small island (close to the harbour). The cruise around Ha Long Bay was very good. The boat was excellent - food good, rooms very nice. We're glad we chose this company and would really recommend to others who want a slightly different tour experience."

            "review": "The best way to discover Halong Bay (even though not perfect). We were three young backpackers travelling with tight budgets for two weeks in Vietnam. Of course Halong Bay was a must-do but we were really concerned about which company to choose for the cruise : the Lonely Planet and comments on TripAdvisor aren't really reassuring. We quickly understood that if we wanted to enjoy Halong Bay we will need to but a little extra money in it (compared to our backpackers budget). We almost chose a company with our hotel but last minute we saw the comments on TripAdvisor and decided to go with Ethnic Travel. A lot of people complain here of how the tours are overpriced which is clearly the case but it's also really easy to negotiate a price that is more fair. That is what we did and we went on a three days Halong Bay / Bai Tu Long Bay tour. A few observations on the accommodation : - during the whole trip the food was great. It was local, fresh and you had more than enough (it seemed like dishes never stopped adding to the table). - the home stay was nice but a little crowded. We were a group a fourteen for one family with a very big house : it looked more like a guesthouse.- the Ethnic travel boats are great. They are pretty minimalist but clean, safe and confortable enough !About what we saw in Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay. I think that Ethnic Travel has several options for three days tour, you can do only Halong Bay, or only Bai Tu Long Bay or both like we did. I think the last option is the best : it would really be a shame to miss Halong Bay which is much more impressive than Bai Tu Long Bay but it would also be a shame not to see the peaceful and authentic Bai Tu Long Bay (which gives an idea of how Halong Bay would be without tourists). One of our main concern was the tourists. I don't know how Ethnic Travel managed to do it but we barely saw any other boats (absolutely none in Bai Tu Long Bay and only at night in Halong Bay) which made our trip really special and enjoyable. But what we enjoyed the most was our guide Coco, and the crew of the ship in Halong Bay. If something had to be improved I would say that there is not a lot that you do during this three days (two times kayak, one time bicycle, and visiting a floating community) and you spend a lot of time in transportation. However I think it might be worse with other companies and it was a wonderful few days to relax before backpacking again around Vietnam and Cambodia."

My Husband and I wanted to visit Ha Long Bay from Ha Noi but was worried it would be really touristy, after going to a few agents we finally ended up here. This was the first place to not show us a shinny brouchure of a boat and the rooms but instead pulled out a map and explianed what you would do and where you would go. Also explianing that they do not go to the caves where there are lots of tourists slowly damaging them and that they go to a more remote area of Ha Long and are the only people to go to Bai Tu Long. By far Bai Tu Long was the best part of the trip, a 4.5 hour drive but then you go on a small boat taking in all the sites with no other boats around and the scenery was beautiful. At the home stay (which was more like local guest house) we were taught how to make spring rolls by our fantastic guide Ker and got learnt so much about the everday lifes of the north Vietnamese. Ha Long was and is alway going to be touirsty but Ethnic manage to find the remote areas and where we moored up there were only two other boats. The first day (Bai Tu) was just 4 people and the second (Ha Long) only 12 so a nice small group. The food was also soo good and they did plenty of it.The Lovely girls at Ethnic also booked our train tickets to Hue for only a small amount more and getting us better tickets. However when we got back off the tour a typhoon had hit Hue meaning our Train was cancelled. It wasn't problem they checked the buses for us but they were full so they booked us on a bus the next day, rang our hotel in Hue to help us explain and change our booking, sorted us out a hotel for that night and transported to it by moped (which was so much fun). They even rang us at the hotel the next morning telling us the trains were back on if we wanted to change from the night bus to train. This is a fantastic company and they go completely above and beyond to help make your trip the best it can be."

Halong Bay is very busy and touristy but worthwhile seeing and Ethnic Travel boat stays overnight it a quieter part of the bay and we were the only boat there when we woke up in the morning. The boat was small but comfortable and the food very good. We were fortunate to only have 4 of us on the Halong Bay trip so it was very relaxing. When we did the Bai Tu Long Bay section my husband and I were the only two on the boat (apparently the company still runs the trip with only 1 person!). Bai Tu Long Bay is much quieter and less touristy and very clean. We enjoyed our stay in the retired fisherman's house on Quan Lan Island, great food and quite comfortable (although there is no air/con and the family turn the electricity off at 5am so the fan stops working and you wake up hot!). We decided to stay an extra night on the island so we could explore it and go to some of the beaches. Our guide helped us to organise a night at a hotel nearby and then we re-joined the next day's Ethnic Travel tour back to Hanoi. We were even invited to join the next group for breakfast at the homestay which wasn't expected. The only negative was the first bus driver was a very reckless driver and we had to ask him to slow down, which he did. Also on our return to Hanoi it was a rush because quite a few of us on the tour had to catch the Sapa train that night, but the bus driver was very careful and a good driver and we made it in time. The staff in the travel office in Hanoi are extremely helpful and really take care of you - we would definitely recommend the company."

They take you to locations that are less busy (a true challenge in the Halong bay). The boats are fine, although a bit worn, but to a manageable extent. A few downsides to consider:- ethnic organizes it's tours as 2 1-day tours (one for Halong and one for Bai Tu Long). The result is that there is some unnecessary waiting as you wait for the groups to meet up. On the first day, in Halong city, we waited for 2 hours (between 1pm and 3pm, the best hours of the day!). The next day we waited again for 1 hour. Because of this, on the first day we arrived to our final destination (where we stayed over for the night) quite late and had no time to swim as it was already too dark- the food was below average. A lot of deep fried foodsOverall, it was a good experience, but be aware that there is likely going to be some annoying waiting around -even though they promised us that it wouldn't be the case at the travel agency!"

In fact, we didn't see any tourist other than our group (14 people). There was another group, also from Ethnic Travel, but we only met them at dinner and breakfast.NEGATIVE: - They group together people who have bought different tours, and try to rearrange the schedule in order to make this possible. So your tour might be changed (to meet their interests). We had to discuss to get, in the end, what we had paid for.- The reason we chose this tour was \"we settle in with a retired fisherman's family for the night\" (taken from thier website), and the interactions we were expecting to have with local people: there was no interaction at all and the place we stayed for the night was just a very bad (and not very clean) hotel. They didn't want to let us use the air conditioning, which was in the room, because it was too expensive, but in the end we managed to obtain it (our room on the last floor was at least a few degrees hotter than the rest of the building). - The schedule is really strict, and you don't have time to enjoy the island, the beach, etc. This is, at least to some extent, probably necessary since the bay is quite far from Hanoi (5 hours driving), so not much time is left. - Our guide was not particularly willing to interact with us. She was a freelance working for Ethnic Travel and had to call the agency several times to solve the troubles (see above). - They don't pick you up from your hotel, as other agencies do.I wouldn't choose again Ethnic Travel. On the basis of other travelers' reviews and what written in the Lonely Planet, as well as the price, we would have expected an excellent service. Anyhow, I didn't find any other travel agency going to Bai Tu Long bay (but surely there must be)."

Our guide, Dong, was from the Hmong people so could speak to the local people even when they didn't speak Vietnamese. She was a great character and we had a lot of fun. Khanh, the delightful owner and founder of Ethnic Travel, managed to persuade us to do the 1-night trip to Bai Tu Long Bay too, which was a chance to experience the scenery of Ha Long Bay without the overcrowding. The Ethnic Travel team understand the desire for unspoiled countryside and authentic experiences which do not have a negative effect on the local economy.

The weather was very hot and humid so a siesta after lunch was very acceptable. First the pluses: the places we saw, the wonderful Vietnamese we met at the home stays, the fabulous scenery are truly unforgettable. Waterfalls, the wonderful view of Tam Coc, the relaxing (vendor free) paddle at Trang An amongst limestone towers and caves, the beautiful peaceful walk and cycles near Trang An and the swimming and relaxing at the Black River, are activities I'm very glad we did. The negatives and they really don't outweighs the positive above; the organisation was very complex with cars, buses meeting and swapping but some how it worked. Some of the drivers used by Ethnic are more speedy and aggressive than is the norm in Vietnam, and that's saying something once you have braved traffic in Hanoi. Our guide was very pleasant but not really very forthcoming, and the engagement we had with our other guides with other companies, was not the case here. None the less, she looked after us and took us to the above wonderful places. Other guides at Ethnic travel we met, seemed a bit more bubbly and enthusiastic. The meals are fabulous, especially the ones provided at home stays. We did not have any problems with tummy upsets. We met fascinating people from other countries, striking up a great bond with a charming French couple. It was interesting talking in our broken French and their excellent English, about their perceptions of Vietnam. The highlight of the trip with Ethnic was at the Black River, where we met Mr Guong and had the pleasure and benefit of his friendliness and hospitality. What a terrific guy! We will certainly use Ethnic travel again as it offers experiences no one else does, and gives us the opportunity to meet ordinary ( or is that extra ordinary ) Vietnamese people and see a different side of Vietnam, an uncrowded, peaceful and richly beautiful place."

As others have noted, you need to be flexible and go with the flow with this outfit -- when picked up at our hotel we were taken to the office where we were told that day 3 would now be day 1 and vice versa. Not a problem, but symptomatic, as from then on, we hardly ever knew where we were or where we were going next. And there was some confusion in the middle, as our group of 5 became (not our choice) a private tour, except when they unaccountably picked up a hitchhiker who hung out with us for most of a day. At first they were going to change guides as the rest of our original party was French and the guide did not speak French.She spoke English, but not super fluently, so I can imagine that it would have been a challenge for the French tourists.  Accomodations were * for *** prices. The \"homestay\" as others have noted, misrepresents the degree of interaction with the family, although the accommodations were fine. The room at the National Park was adequate, barely. The AC was not up to what was needed, and the food was very blah. Guide was pleasant but not very knowledgeable and had only 6 months experience. However she gets points for her handling of a medical emergency (heat exhaustion, possible sun stroke). But it made us wonder why they chose to have us bicycle in over 40 degree heat. The bicycles were in poor repair and no helmets provided. Ethnic Travel is more of an adventure travel company, we think. Set your expectations fairly low and it will be OK. As always, the guide can make or break the trip, but you can't control that. I have no regrets about where we went, but would shop around before choosing Ethnic again."

I asked to see the limestone karst scenery, the people in the villages, and to eat good food. I'm very pleased with the result. My guide, Cho (also goes by \"Joe\"), is Hmong, so he chatted freely with many people we passed in town, on farms, and on trails. He put them at ease--they generally smiled as soon as he started talking. That gave me a view of the people--and lots of good pictures--I could never have had on my own.Reading through other comments on Ethnic Travel I can say I observed some of the same things others complain about, but for me they weren't problems. Yes, there is a certain amount of improvising as you go. Yes, the guide takes phone calls from the home office a lot. Some of it was working out plans for my trip as we went, and some of it was probably working out plans for other people's trips. It was never a problem. Not everything happened exactly as planned, but everything that did happen was good. For example, Ethnic Travel's drivers were all busy the first day of my tour, so the guide hired a taxi for that day and adjusted the itinerary a little. It was no additional expense to me, and we ended up with a great walk I would not otherwise have had through farmlands to a farming village that does not see many visitors. No, the guide was not an expert with prepared lectures on everything we saw and answers to every question I could think of to ask. But he did grow up on a Hmong farm. He could look at the rice and say how many weeks to harvest. He could point out fields that had not been well cared for. He could tell me that a water buffalo and a motorbike both cost roughly the same amount. He could point to small patches of cultivated crops high on the mountainside that I would not have spotted. He could chat with two boys we passed on the trail and tell me they were out trapping songbirds to sell at the market.We ate great food at every meal and ended the trip with a one-night homestay in a farming village that is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. The host spent several hours over a wok making a delicious dinner, and in the morning he made crepes with bananas. At night I took a walk around the village by myself and watched fireflies over the rice paddies.I have to put in a good work for the driver, Phi, who showed up with a sturdy car on the second day. He was friendly too and a very good driver--safe, good reflexes, always alert for potholes as well as oncoming traffic. He doesn't speak much English but we still managed a few jokes together.I would definitely book with Ethnic Travel again and recommend them to others. I advise people to be open to whatever is available rather than coming with too many fixed expectations. Make clear what you want when you book, and then just go with whatever happens. It'll be great."

I think with Ethnic Travel ( as someone else said ) you need to be able \"to go with the flow \" and it helps to be flexible and not expect the timetable to be ridgedly adhered to.We did the 7 day Taste of North Vietnam tour ( with the addition of Halong Bay ), and overall we really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone, remembering the above statement.The scenery everywhere was spectacular and at this time of year the rice paddies green. Other than the Halong Bay area and a couple of short stops in Ninh Binh we did not see any other tourists that were not with Ethnic Travel.That being said our rural part of the tour was supposed to be private but we often found ourselves in a small group of 5 or 6 plus guides when a couple of the tours met up.However we are glad that happened as we met some really lovely people we will keep in contact with.Our guide \"Moon\" was the best guide we have ever had in all our travels, so friendly, happy, and knowledgeable about the different areas we were in, what the crops were, when they would be harvested etc.The food on the boats ( we did Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay ) was outstanding and the meals at the homestays were good and plentiful, however we were looking forward to some western food by the time we got back to Hanoi, also coffee was available but not enough.As others have mentioned about the homestay you are not with the host family, other than to be introduced and to share a green tea or rice wine with, we didn't mind this, ( they didn't speak English. )Only 2 of our nights were spent with a mattress on the floor and outside bathrooms ( still clean and comfortable ) the other nights we had our own room with ensuite, in purpose built annexes to the family home.My only complaint about Ethnic Travel is with the office, they reversed our itinerary with out telling us, so we spent 2 hours (stressed out ) on a mini bus going in the opposite direction to our planned tour with a driver who couldn't speak English, he eventually got the office to speak to me on his phone, when it was explained we were quite happy for the change just wish they had told us earlier !!The office was also constantly phoning the guide and changing the days plans to fit in with other groups and cars, we still did everything that was planned, just not in the order it was planned.So you really do need to be flexible.Travelling to the different areas took a lot longer than we had thought it would, mainly due to either traffic or terrible roads ( Mai Chau ) .The cars were new either mini vans or large A/c wagons similar to a Toyota Prado, however a couple of times a small taxi was used, when I'm guessing the office slipped up.My favourite times were, walking and cycling in very quite areas of Ninh Binh, walking around the rice terraces of Mai Chau, and swimming and kayaking at the Black river. ( all without seeing another tourist not in our small group., or hardly anyone else for that matter. )So would I book with Ethnic Travel again, Yes , but this time I would be more prepared \"to go with the flow \"."

The first impresion was good as they took more time than others to describe their offer. We signed for a 7 days tour: Ha Long Bay, Bai Tu Long Bay, Ninh Binh, Mai Chau.After this, our feelings about this trip is :Positive: young but good guides, friendly and helpful. Cosy lodges and nice homestay ( rustical comfort but very kind owners). Drivers were also driving safely. Nice boats in both bays. Negative: first, it seems that they are a bit more expensive than the others. Then, it's clear that the strategy is to take as many customers as possible, resulting in a very chaotic organization, with guides waiting permanently for decisions from the direction per telephon. Exemple: the 5th day was a national parc planned. After a spontaneous walk threw the rice fields in the morning and 1 hour waiting for the bus, we had 1 hour to see some monkeys of the parc... The national parc would have a whole day desserved.... Sorry, no more time. And then 5.5 hours driving (3 announced)...Conclusion: exept one day, everything was quite ok and it will remain for us as a good experience to start our trip in Vietnam"

            "review": "Extremely helpful manager. Just returned from a 2 night/3 day Halong & Bai Tu Long Bay tour with Ethnic Travel. Contrary to the recent experiences other posters seem to have had, our group had a really good time!Our tour got off to a bit of a slow start when the bus was almost an hour late to pick us up. Frustrating, but was made better when they promised to refund us $10 for our waiting time at the end of the trip. As a budget traveler (who only splurged for this trip because I wanted to be sure I got what I was promised) that was good enough for me and I was happy to have saved a little money for my troubles.Our first boat in Halong was very nice, with hot showers and comfortable beds. The weather was dreary but the ride out to the floating village was very cool and the food was delicious. The group we went with all got along very well, and we had a great time despite the weather.Day 2 went as promised with a morning kayak, a 90 minute drive to BTL Bay, and a yummy lunch on our new boat. We were joined by 4 new travelers, which made our total 15 people (we were promised no more than 13). I didn't mind, though, as I didn't feel crowded and the new additions to our group were very friendly.The homestay was nice, although more like a guesthouse. There was no hot water, but it was understandable as the village only has power ~5 hours a day! They did overbook the homestay and had to ask people to share beds. They seemed pretty determined to get it all sorted out, though, and in the end I think everyone was satisfied.The last day we rode bikes to the beach before having lunch and heading back. We all were pretty happy with the tour as a whole. Our tour guide was very sweet and friendly, and her English was very good. She helped to smooth over/explain any confusion or problems.The most defining event, though, and the reason that I feel compelled to write a review, is that there was a leak in our room and our camera got wet and was damaged. We talked to our guide as soon as it happened and she assured us they would take care of it at the office when we returned. Sure enough (after having been paid our promised $10) a staff member walked us to the camera shop and helped us explain the problem to the worker. It was only $25 to fix, so they agreed to cover the cost. It was annoying to us that we had to stay in Hanoi an extra day while we waited to have it fixed, but we were glad they were taking care of it for us.The next day we found out the damage was worse than expected, and it would cost significantly more to fix. It took a bit of haggling with the staff members to figure out who should pay, but ultimately the manager decided that it was a problem with the boat that caused the damage and so they would pay the entire cost of fixing it. We were so relieved as this would have made a huge dent in our travel funds and been a total pain if they hadn't stepped in and taken care of it. Very, very good customer service, and very unlikely to have happened if we had gone with a budget tour.In the end, we paid the slightly higher prices because we wanted some sort of assurance that we would be looked after during our tour. Not everything went 100% perfectly, but the staff was VERY determined to make sure we had a good time and left happy, and made reparations for every mistake. Thus, I definitely feel spending the extra $ was worth it!"

            "review": "What you see is NOT what you get!. Our experience with Ethnic Travel started off so well... We sat in their office with cups of tea going through our trip, the 3 day / 2 night Halong and Bai Tu Bay cruise. At $169 pp it was a bit pricey but as it was the end of our holiday, we wanted to ensure it would be enjoyable. The first night would be spent on the boat in Halong Bay, the second at a homestay on Quan Lan island in Bai Tu Bay. We were shown photos of each boat we would sail on, along with photos of the homestay. There was no hard sell, we asked lots of questions and got a good vibe. They even reimbursed the $3 charge the cash machine charged us. On arrival at Halong Port we were informed that strong winds were forecast and the government had banned all boats from staying overnight. We would have 4 hours in the bay, then come back to Halong where we would be accommodated in a hotel. We were disappointed but obviously this is beyond any company's control and with a history of boats sinking in the bay, the government is understandably cautious. But instead of making the most of what little time we now had, we had to wait an hour for our tour guide to turn up. As Bai Tu isn't affected by the same weather systems, we wondered if we could go there first and then come back to Halong the next day. However when the tour guide arrived he was with four other customers who had just come from Bai Tu to join us, thus making any change in our schedule impossible. We boarded the boat and sailed around Halong. For the majority of this time, the \"guide\" was on the phone to the office, or avoiding us. He couldn't manage the situation or answer any of our questions. His English was not \"excellent\" as Ethnic Travel Promise. Fortunately, the contingency accommodation for the night turned out to be a lovely place with a pool and great food. If they'd told us this from the start there wouldn't have been such a negative atmosphere. The next morning we drove to meet the Bai Tu Long Bay boat with renewed confidence in Ethnic Travel. According to the photos shown, today we would sail in their junk boat. What we actually got was a basic local boat. There were no seats on deck, just old tyres, broken decking and nails sticking up. Inside there were hard wooden benches. It made for a very uncomfortable five hour journey!! Docking in Quan Lan we had to cross two dredger boats and scale a precariously balanced plank, with our luggage, to get to land. There was a crowd of locals waiting to get on the boat we had just came off too. Clearly a cheap local ferry. Arriving at the \"homestay\" there seemed to be some confusion. It was not the homestay we had been shown photos of either. It transpired this was because the real homestay was full with another Ethnic Travel tour and we had been bumped to a house 100 yards away. This house had no facilities and no communal area. We went to the homestay for dinner where the other tour group told us they had a guide that spoke good English and they had a comfortable boat. We asked our guide to ensure that the manager would be in the office when we returned to Hanoi so that we could complain about the second rate accommodation and boat. Next day, we returned to the port on another boat, but still not the advertised junk. On route to Hanoi we again asked the guide to ensure the manager would be in the office as our group wished to make a complaint. Of course the manager was not in the office. However after very little complaining from us, Ethnic Travel offered our group a 50% refund which we accepted. Leaving the office, we met another couple who were unhappy with their Halong experience - the Junk boat had been overbooked and there were not enough beds. They also received a refund. If you book this tour with Ethnic do not expect what you see is what you get. The reason it's getting a Poor and not a Terrible rating is purely down to the contingency accommodation, the nice group we had and the fact we got a refund!"

You will get small groups, it's easy to book with them and the places they go to are simply gorgeous. Bai Tu Long Bay was amazing. Not once did we see other tourists around. It was wonderful!However, when we booked two separate tours (Ninh Binh & Bai Tu Long Bay(2 days)) there were some disappointments that I can't get past:1. We paid extra for what we were told were private tours for both - which as it turned out after we were confused when other people joined our tour that a 'private tour' was no more than 8 people. That's not private, that's called a 'small group'!2. For our Bai Tu Long Bay trip, not only did we have to accept that a 'private tour' is not really private, we were also told on our way there (they rang our guide so they could talk to us over the phone) that we will no longer have 8 people in the tour it will now be 13. They did say they will refund the extra we paid for the 'private tour' though. And lucky the group we were with ended up to be great guys.3. Bai Tu Long Bay 'homestay'. I am not disappointed that the place ended up being a guest house, which I have seen as a complaint in other reviews. The disappointment was the lack of interaction with the family which would have been fantastic had they eaten with us. Instead we ate at one table, they ate at another. For breakfast, they served us crepes, and they had some local dish which smelt amazing!4. Bai Tu Long Bay guide. Our english speaking guide spoke very little english and when he did he was so hard to understand!5. Communication about changes to the tours were lacking. Things changed constantly and you are just told but without explanation. I was constantly on edge wondering what changes could be in store for us! I found it hard to relax. I think the secret here is to just go with the flow.Overall, it was a good experience, the bike rides (though some bikes were faulty and kept breaking down!) was great, and the food was sufficient. However, if you are booking to think you will get an authentic local Vietnamese experience and feel less a tourist, then you'll be disappointed. At the end of the day, it's still a tourist's tour, especially Ninh Binh."

We chose Ethnical Travel because of its ethical statement and its status as a recommended tour operator in Lonely Planet Guide.We had intended to go on a trip to Sapa, but after were persuaded by the man at the main office to go on 'Black River Adventure' 3 days/ 2 nights trip to Mai Chau area, as it was less busy than Sapa and the scenery is nicer.Unfortunately the information provided in the itinerary (which was printed for us from their website) was wrong - we went to different villages other than the ones mentioned and the activities occurred on different days and for shorter time durations than specified. We did have a bike ride (although the bikes are in need of maintenance), kayaked and trekked.Contrary to our itinerary we also went for lunch at the same place for each of the 3 days, without any interaction with the hosts and no information about the place at all. There was also limited opportunity to interact with the 2 overnight homestay hosts, other than when they served us our evening meal (they did not eat with us).After comparing itineraries with other guests on the trip it seemed that we had all be given differing information. This resulted in a fairly uncomfortable discussion on our 2nd night with our guide, who after insisting that the tour had been the same for that last 12 years, tried to negotiate different activities for everyone to meet the requirements of the trip they had been sold by the office.We were also not advised that there was a young child on our trip and a proportion of our planned trekking was replaced by taxi trips, as it seemed our adjusted to pace caused us to fall behind schedule (certainly not the child's fault).Also - the black 'river' was actually dammed up nearly 30 years ago and instead is a large reservoir. You can still swim in it and kayak on it - but it certainly not an adventerous activity as indicated by the title of the tour.We asked our guide how much of the $169 ticket price (group of 7 adults 1 child) goes to homestay hosts and were told that $20 per person goes to hosts who provide dinner, overnight accom and breakfast, with $8 per person to hosts who provide lunch - hopefully this is true!! The trip was nice enough - the scenery there is beautiful and because of this parts of the tour were very enjoyable, our tour guide was friendly enough and dealt with the conflicting itineraries calmly, however for the price you pay we felt that the overall tour lacked sparkle, indepth information and ethnic authenticity.We provided our feedback to Ethnic Travel and they offered us $20 per person refund and said that they will use the feedback to improve the service - hopefully they do!"

We had an SUV to take us from Hanoi and for the entire trip, which was in great condition and driven by Lam who was an excellent driver, especially through the treacherous mountain roads of Ha Giang province. Our guide was Cho, who was from the flower Hmong minority. He could speak English, Vietnamese and the Hmong language. His knowledge of Hmong was particularly needed because some people in many of the villages in the mountains were not well versed with Vietnamese. He hag good knowledge of the history of the minorities, their customs and was a fantastic guide overall.When they said they would give us a local experience, believe me it was truly local. We ate at restaurants only frequented by locals and not the westernized Vietnamese cuisine restaurants for tourists. However, the toilet facilities in these restaurants were dirty and smelly. One day was a homestay with a local Tay minority family, and it was a great experience eating and talking with them. The hotels chosen for the other two days were pretty decent too. In Dong Van, we hiked through trails in the karst formation mountains, and we came across beautiful, rugged expansive views and some Hmong families and kids in a school on the mountains. Cho and Lam were kind and flexible, knew the lay of the land, and made our trip a memorable one. Kudos as well to their excellent pre-sales service, speedy response to emails, and top-notch service by Thu and David at their office in Hanoi."

Our guide was very friendly and knowledgable - her English, although heavily accented, was good, and she was happy to answer all our questions. The cycling was great - through the narrow village streets past houses and gardens that we would never have seen otherwise and the lunch prepared by our host family was some of the best food we've had so far in Vietnam (and we've been eating exclusively local food and a lot of street food). After, the canoe trip through the caves was enjoyable - and better for the fact that we were able to specify that 5 caves was more than enough for us (there are 12 in total, but really, seen one, seen 'em all...) and that we didn't want to stop off and climb the hill to see the seldom-visited and slightly skanky-looking pagoda (our guide was thrilled by our decision...by this stage, she was freezing). Overall, we were very happy with this excursion as a way to see a small part of the local, semi-rural Vietnames life off the main tourist trail that we wouldn't otherwise have had the chance to see."

The day we arrived in Hanoi we visited the office and booked a 7 day tour of Northern Vietnam which included Halong Bay, Bai Tu Long Bay,Ninh Binh, and Mai Chau.The largest group we had was in Halong and Bai Tu Long Bays: around 12 people.Halong Bay: Probably the highlight of the trip, sitting on the deck of the ship and watching the limestone rock formations pass all around you. Then kayaking and swimming in some parts of the bay. We also took a short boat ride into one of the fishing villages. Bai Tu Long Bay: Not as majestic as Halong Bay but definitely cleaner and less populated. Stayed with a family where we learned how to make spring rolls at Quan Lan. The next day we took a bike ride to a deserted beach. My only gripe about the trip was that we were supposed to take Ethnic Travels own junk boat but had to take a smaller rented boat because the company boat was being repaired.Ninh Binh: We biked through beautiful limestone rock formations and stopped at Mua Cave and hiked to the top of Quan Am altar for a beautiful view. Then we stopped at the Trang An Grottoes for a boat ride through limestone caves and to several temples. We stayed with a very nice family in their lovely guesthouse.Mai Chau: Took a short hike up a mountain to the rice terraces and village where we stayed with a very nice family. The next day we did another hike and then a bike ride through the village. At night we stayed with another family: Mr. and Mrs Guong in their home along the Black River where we learned how to make more Vietnamese dishes. In the morning we kayaked along the river and headed back to Hanoi.Our tour guides and drivers were very friendly and professional especially Pilulu and Mr. Hieu who we were with the majority of the time. The families we stayed with were very hospitable and accommodating. One family even did our laundry (for a small fee).The families we stayed with and the food they made for us was the most memorable parts of our trip. We were so disappointed when we got back into Hanoi and found that the food didn't taste as good as the home cooked meals we had with our host families. But this tour is not for EVERYONE. If you are used to staying in 3 star hotels with air conditioning and flush toilets, this may not be for you. Most of the home stays we were in didn't have AC. We slept under mosquito nets with fans nearby and used toilets and showers detached from the homes. But if you really value learning about culture and being treated like family I would definitely recommend this tour group."

Upon taking the tour we express our concerns of some of the negative views we read about the company on trip advisor in which he express that it was only small percentage of people that wrote them and they have taken action and improved their service. We took the 2 days 1 night Bay ty long bay tour. Bay tu long bay is very far away compared to ha long bay. Ok not so bad as you are away from all tourists however for such a short trip, it was just too far. we spent most of the day travelling to get to bay tu long bay, something like 8 hours. the guides were friendly but didnt know anything about the knowledge of the area, the lakes, history etc when asked. The food on the boat was average, very greasy. The island itself was lovely and the bike ride to the home stay was really nice. but it was all very rushed. we only sp[ent 10 minutes or so on the beach, would have prefered longer. the food in the home stay was again very average and greasy. the breakfast consisted of brown, rubber like pancakes....however this didnt stop a french guy who gobbled up the rubber pancakes quicker than you can say oo la la.....i think this tour deserves longer, perhaps leaving at 6am rather than 8:30am so that you have more time on the island otherwise it just feels like one massive journey with no time to relax and chill. we paid 95% eachy for this which i think was too much to be honest."

            "review": "Ok, but disappointing. We got the 3 days, 2 nights tour to halong and bai tu long bay. Well, first what they told us: free food and drinks, double room on boat on halong; second trip on a sail junk boat, kayaking, bike, some beach, max 10 people and overnight at an old fishermans house With a guide tour for every step.What really happened: drinks were always by our own and very expensive, like 2.50USD for a tiger beer semi-cold; double rooms were limited on the boat and guesthouse and not enough for every couple on the trip; we were around 13 on the first night and 16 on the second. No junk boat. No explanation for that at all, only by request and vague answer. There was this sensation that the tour was being organized at it was goin on. On the second day we kayaked twice in different locations and we had to take turns because there werent enough kayaks. We also had counterclock beach time, like ten minutes on day 3. The guides were nice but mostly translators and didnt explained much unless you kept asking. Also, the oldman house turned out to be a cheap guesthouse with little interaction, bad rooms but good vibe between tourists.Overall the trip was nice, the boat avoided the main tourist areas on halong and the sleepover is worth for the sunrise on the bay. The bike tour was nice, bai tu long is a nice getaway from the tourist buzz. We think we paid extra for being \"ethnic\" And at the end the tour wasnt very well organized but was still worth it despite giving the impression that it was expensive.Oh, the meals were always good and fulfilling. But no free drinks!"

However, the experience with Ethnic Travel was largely disappointing. We chose this tour in a large part because it promised daily hikes. We confirmed this aspect via email and in person in Hanoi. But we only went on one hike in the 5 days. The guide was nice, but was more like a translator to order food than provide information and insights into the places and people we were visiting. The guide never got any of the information we gave to the staff in Hanoi about diet and preferences. We did really enjoy the family homestay near Ha Giang city. But for the price, i was expecting more from the tour company."

            "review": "Two Tours Two Views - First Review. We booked with Ethnic Travel for 2 tours. 5 days to Ninh Binh, Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay, Quan Lan Island and 8 days to the North West with a short break in Hanoi between the two. They turned out to be 2 different experiences (you would almost think we used 2 different tour companies).Our first tour started with our guide's arrival at our hotel (on time) to tell us that the company proposed to change the order of our tour because the weather forecast for Halong Bay was for windy/rainy change to arrive in a couple of days so we should go to Halong first. No argument from us. (Now wonder if we were just making up numbers for other tours - hmmm?) At a rest stop 2 hours down the road we were told that the group which we would join at Halong would not arrive until 1:00pm and that our ETA was 12:00pm so perhaps we should look at souvenirs a little longer. (Perhaps if we had been forewarned we could have had a more leisurely breakfast and a later departure from Hanoi.) We duly arrived at Halong at 12 even after the prolonged stop and then sat in a carpark until after 2:00pm when the other group arrived and we were told to follow them (no explanations, no apologies, and no introduction to the new guide who now seemed to be in charge of the combined group and who had no interest in us). Onto the boat (nice boat, well appointed, good cabins, most uncomfortable deck furniture in the world) where lunch was served and eaten while we sat at the wharf for a further hour. Needless to say that by the time we got under way the day was almost gone and the day's program (visit to a floating village and kayaking) was severely curtailed. Ah well, this is Vietnam and some hiccups can be expected, let's just relax with a nice cold beer - well not so cold, hmmm, $2.50, hmmm, you want a mixed drink? you'll have to buy the whole bottle for $40, hmmmmm, a glass of wine? sorry the bottle or nothing, hmmmm, water/tea/coffee?, $1, hmmmmmm. That's enough! When the start is disappointing it becomes easy to become picky. Suffice to say our Halong Bay experience wasn't quite what we had hoped. Oh and that first evening our guide (for 5 days we thought) informed us that she would take her leave of us back on shore and we would join another group to Bai Tu Long. Bai Tu Long Bay is lovely, the boat was good, lunch was good, with a bright young guide who included us, and the company was good. Things were looking up. We arrived at Quan Lan Island on dark and were transported to our Home-stay. More a guest house than a home-stay with very little interaction with the family whose house it was. A bit disappointing but we had a nice evening all the same.Back to the boat (our guide was staying on the island with the party she had brought from Hanoi) - don't worry there will be a guide at the other end to meet you,or maybe not. Someone will take you from the boat to your van which will take you to Ninh Binh. Wellll, that didn't happen either. Finally we found a van but no driver. After 10 minutes a driver appeared, a bit perplexed by these 4 people asking if he was their ride to Ninh Binh. But in we got and off we went. A phone call later and we are told we will change vans in Halong but still no word on our guide.Skip forward 5 hours and we arrive at our home-stay (well guest house - no interaction here either) in Ninh Binh to be met by four members of the Halong Bay group and their guide (but no guide for us). Not a comfortable re-union. Maybe tomorrow? Why not forget Ninh Binh and join this group who are heading off to somewhere else tomorrow? Pardon?Tomorrow, finally, a guide of our own and he is very good and we have a good day (but no van, it went with the other group, so perhaps we can walk?). The next day goes well also, then back to Hanoi.It reads worse than it was. We got round the annoyances and enjoyed the surroundings and sights. It just didn't live up to expectations. These expectations were built on some great reviews on trip advisor and unfortunately we didn't have the experience that some reviewers have had. The world hadn't ended."

It was chaotic and somewhat rude. They just paid attention to us regarding paymets but not about our questions. We were promised a tour with maximum 10 people and there were 14. When we questioned this they said the group would split. This didnt happen. The trip on tr boat and the food is very good but the homestay is not very authentic. Yes it is someones house but it is more of an Ethnic travel guesthouse than a homestay. With 14 people on the tour it is difficult to feel like you are on a homestay and the family didn't seem too interesting in interacting with us. Finally, one of the guides, Mimi, was extremely rude to one of the women on the trip, to the extent that the whole group had to intervene to calm her shouting and insults.Overall it wad extremely disappointing and not at all what Lonely Planet makes it out to be, an authentic way of seeing areas of Vietnam."

We just went on a 3 day 2 night trip with Ethnic Travel, and after reading the itinerary on the website we were really looking forward to this trip, unfortunately it did not live up to our expectations. Halong bay was amazing, and Bai Tu bay potentially even better because it is much more authentic, less crowded and cleaner. That said, this may not be the tour provider to go with - at several times throughout the trip we were left to stand out in the blazing sun with all our bags for half an hour or more while our guide went off to organize something, we were put on a boat that did not belong to the company because all thier boats were already being used, and the crew were extremely unpleasent, drinks on the boat were about twice as expensive as on the Ethnic Travel boats - and even though we booked the tour through ethnic travel we still had to pay the exorbitant prices of the boat company we were put on. The water was dirty where they had us swim in Halong bay, and several people were ill the next morning after swimming. We were on a Ethnic Travel boat in Bai Tu bay and this was much nicer, the crew was very friendly and the food excellent on this boat. We were supposed to stay in a 'fischerman's hut' on the second evening, however this turned out to be a family with just a regular house - there was only a little interaction between us and the family and it really felt like a very cheap hostel - on top of which the rooms were incredibly hot 40+ C and we were not allowed to open the windows.... It was a horrible night for everyone. In the morning we found out that for 5$ more there would have been hotel rooms around the corner with AC ... it was too late for that information as several people were sick with heat stroke. All in all I think this is an amazing experience but it is worth it to really precisely find out what you are getting advance, ethnic travel was OK but there is a lot of room for improvement, we definately did not feel that we got the extra special experience which we paid extra for..."

I am a little late on writing this review but thats how good this company is, still six months after traveling with them I still think about the trip they took me on and had to write a review to help any other travelers thinking about booking a guide around Vietnam. I booked a 3 day trip around Ha Long and Tu Long bay and it was amazing! Their guides speak a variety of languages so my french girlfriend was able to speak to them as well as my english friends I brought along. The good communication does not stop there while we were on the trip around the bay (in their absolutely AMAZING boat) they were constantly asking us which of the planned activities we would like to spend more time on, which ones we wanted to skip and they were more than happy to accommodate all of our requests. The best part of traveling with them was that they took all of the hassle out of traveling around the country. I have been all throughout southeast asia and traveling was never very hard to organize, but not in Vietnam. Even the simplest things such as catching a public bus were very hard to organize. So with ethnic they planned out everything such as transportation, food and activities which left us with nothing but time for FUN! We were so impressed with our first tour that upon arriving back in Hanoi we immediately booked another trip down to the Nihn Bin province. Another great choice because most people who travel will head to Tan Coc and when we asked they told about the pro's and con's and allowed us to make our own decision. We ultimately decided to travel with them to the destination they proposed which was great because they were right. The Tam Coc area is so overrun with tourist that most of the natural beauty is not able to be properly enjoyed because of the sheer amount of people there and the constant pestering by pushy vendors. Also they have these great \"home stays\" where you are able to stay overnight in these great houses owned by locals. They welcome you to their home, cook you dinner and do their best to converse with you and insure that you leave Vietnam with a great impression of the people of the country. Ethnic Travel pays these locals to fix up their house and rent them out which is a great way to give back to the local communities without taking away from their natural culture. Do yourself a favor and book with Ethnic Travel, you will not be disappointed!"

So contacted Ethnic and they helpt me to an hospital. One doctors visit later (in Vietnam this is a group activity had five people from the staff taking care of me...) resulted in five different medications. Antibioticts, anti histamin etc... The next problem was that we had booked the in depth tour of Sapa, where you are supposed to live in a homestay for several nights making it impossible to keep my skin clean.... Ethnic arranged an hotel room (nice and clean inside Sapa...) for us instead and supplied me and my girlfriend with our own guide and a car that would help us getting to the starting spots of the various daily hikes since we had to return to Sapa every night. Our guide \"Pi\" was really good.When we came back to Hanoi Ethnic also compensated me for the hospital bill. All in all, I'm very happy with how they fixed the situation. Usually you can judge a company by their behaviour when something goes wrong, and Ethnic passed with flying colors when it comes to taking care of their customers.Ohh... We prefered the Ba Be trip where the food was relly nice and the view was awesome. Not turisty at all. Sapa is full of tourists...Peter & Tammy"

Our guide was Zu. The food was plentiful and well prepared, the boat and homestay facilities were clean and nice, and the scenery was beautiful. The drive to Bai Tu Long took about 5 hours and it was slow going as the road has a lot of traffic. We had lunch on the boat as soon as we arrived, and it was delicious. The kayaking and cycling were both not too challenging and really fun. So overall it was an excellent tour.I recommend this tour.

From reading the guidebooks, I had originally intended to go to Sapa, but the owner convinced me that Mai Chau was less touristy and that the rice terraces would make a better backdrop for hiking at this time of year (versus Sapa.) EXCELLENT recommendation - the walking was great, the fields were a few weeks from harvest time and we saw exactly 4 western tourists during the entire 3 days. The trip was a great chance to get off the beaten path, enjoy some home cooked meals and the back country scenery. As advertised, the hikes (a couple of hours per day), sleeping accommodations (mats on the floor with mosquito nets) and the baths (running water but primitive) will mean that this trip is not for everyone. But, if you like some adventure and to be in nature with good spirited people - you will LOVE this trip. I learned a lot about the ethnic tribes and various aspects of agriculture, so there is plenty to keep you interested."

They promise to take you away from the crowds and they really do. First day was Bai Tu Long Bay. After 5 hr trip by minibus (good quality, with working seat belts) we boarded a junk boat and were served lunch while enjoying the scenery. Then we stopped for some kayaking, which was an absolute delight! We stayed the night with the local family on Bai Tu Long Bay island. Room was super hot (forget the ac, electricity is so outrageously expensive) but the experience was great nonetheless. We had a chance to cook the evening meal with the family, which was great. In the morning we set off to explore the island by bikes. Views were amazing. The whole Bai Tu Long Bay is definitely off the beaten path, beautiful and unspoiled by hoards of tourist boats. I don't think we have seen any other tourist. It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Vietnam. On the second day we transferred to Ha Long and I have to say this experience looks very pale in comparison to the first day. Boat is chartered, Ethnic Travel does not own it. Service was really quite bad- very little consideration for the passengers. They were consistently putting on loud music, even if we were asking to turn it off. Room on the boat was just OK, nothing to write home about. They had absolutely nothing to drink for kids (we were traveling with 3yo)- no juice for example. Prices for drinks (which are not included in the tour price) were totally ridiculous. Ethnic Travel could perhaps reconsider which boat they are using, as this just doesn't fit to what they offer otherwise. If we were to do it again, I would choose Bai Tu Long Bay trip only and forget Halong. In my opinion it's totally over-rated. It was like cruising on a highway. Probably if you are on a really nice boat with great service it's quite OK though.Our guide, Hien was really great and helpful."

For tours off the beaten track -- especially involving trips to minority areas -- this company would definitely be my first choice."

We booked a 3 day / 2 night Ha Long Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay cruise and a 4 night / 3 day Sapa trek with Ethnic travel at their Hanoi office. We picked this company because they specialise in small group tours that provide insight into the real Vietnam. They also give back to the local communities through homestays they arrange and by employing local people -- their intentions are genuine and not solely profit-driven like some other companies out there. The staff at the office were professional, helpful, friendly and answered all of our questions candidly.Being completely honest, our Ha Long Bay cruise got off to a rough start. Ethic Travel contracts out to a different company so this company initially sent an old, dilapidated boat to pick us up. Our tour guide Thuong arranged for a different boat to pick us up at our request, however we lost about 1.5 hours. We sailed out to Ha Long Bay and parked for the night. The next morning we sailed further out to a floating fishing village where we kayaked. The food was average but plentiful. We found Ha Long Bay itself to be overcrowded with other boats and the fishing village was no different. The water was brown and very dirty. It didn't help that the weather was rainy and misty which obscured the views.We sailed back to the harbour, then boarded a minivan for about one hour to a different harbour to start the Bai Tu Long Bay cruise. This time we boarded Ethnic Travel's own boat which was much more comfortable, clean and cozy. They served us a \"family style\" lunch on the boat which was abundant, varied and delicious -- some of the best food we had in Vietnam. We sailed for a bit then stopped to kayak. Our group was the only one kayaking which made it much more enjoyable compared to Ha Long Bay. We continued sailing to Quan Lan island where we stayed overnight with a hospitable local family. The next morning we biked through the island where our boat was waiting for us on the other side. We had another delicious lunch on the boat while we sailed back toward the harbour. We stopped at a small island on the way and hiked to the top of a mountain where we saw beautiful views overlooking the bay. We preferred Bai Tu Long over Ha Long Bay because you see the same beautiful scenery but there are no other tourist boats and the water is a beautiful blue. If we were to do this trip again we would have skipped Ha Long Bay entirely and just gone to Bai Tu Long Bay.Our Sapa experience was wonderful too. We paid a reasonable amount which included the trekking, guide, 2 nights homestay, meals (drinks not included), private train (soft sleeper, A/C) to/from Hanoi, taxi from the Ethnic Travel office to the Hanoi train station, minibus from Lao Cai to Sapa town and use of a hotel's faciliities in Sapa to shower after the train ride and trek. Our guide Su was very friendly, spoke excellent English and answered all of our questions about life in Sapa. The trek itself was difficult at times with steep terrain and hot weather but the views more than made up for it. We loved our first homestay as the family was especially warm and seemed genuinely happy to host us and the food was excellent. The only downside was we often felt pressured to buy handicrafts from the local ethnic people who would follow us on the trek or hang out for an hour at our homestay. However from speaking with other travellers this is very common in Sapa -- just be prepared for it!Bai Tu Long Bay and Sapa were definitely highlights of our trip and we felt we saw more of \"authentic\" Vietnam thanks to Ethnic Travel."

Our local guide was very good (her name is Nui =New) and we stayed at homestays. She did explain us about the region and the people. In the first homestay the food was great, the second a bit less but a very local experience. I would recommend this tour to everyone. Please pack good hiking shoes because it is 3 days of trekking. Level is medium. Furthermore we booked a trip to Halong Bay as well but after we arrived back from Sapa they forgot to pick us up at the station in Hanoi. And this was very annoying. We called the office, but the guy who runs the office just hang up a couple of times. He told us on the end that there was a lady with our names on a paper but we missed her. We did not see a lady and being the only Western faces waiting 1 hour after the train arrived she would have seen us standing at the station waiting and him not answering his phone. Halong bay is nice but it is better to go in the summer season. Now it was quite cold. Our guide was very rude (her name is Ha) and to much orientated on Western travellers (read Western guys). The food was great!!! The Room was okay, hot water. I would recommend SAPA but not Halong Bay."

Myself, my wife and two daughters (ages 12 and 16) traveled with Ethic Travel for 4 days last month as part of a month-long trip in Vietnam. The experience they provided was the highlight of our time in Vietnam.Mr. Khanh provided prompt and clear advice as we lined up our trip stateside via email. Once there, our trip was well organized and timely executed. His team of personable guides and drivers were great. In addition to clearly explaining the geography, customs and history of the areas we visited (Bai Tu Long Bay, Halong Bay and Ninh Binh) they all had a great sense of humor and enjoyed conversation. The home stays were wonderful, with the guides acting as translators we talked into the night with our hosts and ate some of the best meals our trip. The accommodations were clean comfortable and gave us invaluable insight to the day to day life of rural Vietnamese families.Ethnic Travel Vietnam is a wonderful experience and great value culturally and economically."

The first day (Bai Tu Long Bay) there were some problems with the boat and therefore we arrived quite late at Quan Lan island, when it was already completely dark and cold. Beside that, we really enjoyed the trip: we especially recommend to visit the fish market of the homestay village\u00a0around 6-6.30am for an insight into Vietnam far from the usual touristic experiences. We were there on Christmas day and it is probably our best memory of the whole trip in Vietnam. The second day (Halong Bay) everything ran pretty smoothly. The traditional junk was very comfortable and the food was delicious. We'd definitely recommend this trip: it's slightly more expensive than other similar tours, but the guides are cool and, let me say it again, the food is just great, both at the homestay on Quan Lam island and on the junk."

We totally agree with the comments of the first review about Sapa, but luckily we had a good tour to Halong Bay. We first did the tour to Sapa. We were accompanied by a woman who didn't speak a word English. Because of her we almost missed our train in Hanoi to Lao Cai. She left us at the station and disappeared and showed up 1 minute before the train left with our tickets. The pickup at Lao Cai station was good. A man was there and brought us to Sapa. There we arrived at this horrible hotel and got a dirty room to have a shower in. Someone had been sleeping in the room and the wet towels and garbage were still on the floor. (If you pay a little more for a Sapa tour you expect it to be a little better!) Our guide was a 20 year old girl that came from the area, but thought that this tour was all about running. She didn't tell us a lot and we arrived two times way to early at the homestay. The food at the homestays was excellent though and lots of fun with the family. The homestays even had showers!We thought the second hiking day was disappointing, because the views were not very nice because of a waterelectricitycompany and erosion. The third hiking day was even more disappointing, because we didn't saw anything. We walked through a village and walked back to the homestay without any explanation. In the taxi back to Lao Cai was some misunderstanding about our traintickets and about the restaurant where we were supposed to have dinner, but after some calls in broken english it was all arranged properly. When we arrived from Sapa at Hanoi station, Ethnic Travel was supposed to pick us up for our tour to Halong Bay. They were one hour late and we had to call them. After that it was all much better. The guide Thong explained us everything and likes to talk about Vietnam and the surroundings of Halong Bay. The boat we slept the first night was perfect. Nothing wrong with it. The food was excellent! We visited a floating fisherman's town and kayaked the next morning. That day we went to Bai Tu Long Bay with a new group and a new guide Hyen. That all worked out. We had a nice boattrip through the bay, had a bycicle-trip on the island, a good homestay and again great food! The next day we had another short kayaking trip, before we headed back to Hanoi. I recommend not to book a tour to Sapa with Ethnic Travel, but do recommend them for the Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay tour."

            "review": "Great sights and guides, but somewhat expensive and disorganized. We went on two tours with this tour company--a two day Sapa trip and a 3 day Mekong Delta trip, and had very disparate experiences.The Sapa trip was amazing. Our tour guide was very friendly and informative, and spoke very good English. We spent two days walking through the somewhat treacherous hills and valleys of the region, and saw some beautiful scenery on the way. We also stayed with a delightful family (note that the term \"home stay\" actually means that you'll be sleeping in a dorm-like room adjacent to the family's home), and had some delicious meals. My one complaint would be that the overnight train car that the company booked us on was one of the budget cars (which would have been fine except that the tour was sort of expensive).The Mekong Delta trip, on the other hand, was very hit or miss. The car that picked us up from HCMC was 30 minutes late, and then we got dropped off at a home stay for 2 hours without explanation while we waited for our tour guide to arrive with other guests who were on a trip that left the day before. We soon found out that our trip fit in between an overlap between two other groups led by our guide--one group started the day before us, and another group joined us on our second day. As a result of this Jimmy-rigged tour, we didn't get to go to one of the cities that was promised on the itinerary. The two other groups of people on the tour also said that their tour started several hours later than promised. Basically, we later figure out that the company only has one over-worked guide in the Mekong Delta, and is overbooking clients on overlapping tours. To its credit, the company did refund us some of our money when we complained, but we felt bad for the tour guide, who is obviously working very hard and trying to cope with no backup or support. The tour guide was very friendly, and the tour itself (once it started) was interesting and fun. Be sure to bring mosquito spray!!"

We normally don't book tours and decided to give it a go as this company was offering the sort of low-key, eco friendly visits that we like and we were not disappointed. We booked a one day trip to the Ninh Binh province (Red river delta). We were picked up at our hotel right on time and drove 2h30 to the area. The van was very clean and comfy and it was only the two of us booked that day! Upon arrival we took a walk around the charming country area and had lunch with a family, we helped them prepare spring rolls and had a fantastic meal. We cycled through the rice fields and limestone cliffs and went on a boat ride; our guide was good though hungover so she wasn't talking much however she was very friendly and we could see she was doing her best! The website says they take you to less touristy area and it is true, the landscape was amazing though not as dramatic as what it could have been just one km further where all the tourists go and I regretted that a part of this tour did not include this."

            "review": "Could have been great.... We took the 3 day, 2 night Bai Tu Long Bay and Halong Bay trip. The original price was $198, which was discounted down to $178 prior to booking. This tour could have been amazing, but was marred by insincere marketing on the website and in email correspondence and some issues that weren't handled quite right by the management. Pros:> Our two tour guides were AMAZING: If you take this trip, try to get either Mimi or Ma Pharm to guide you. They are very different, very sweet young ladies who will ensure you have a great trip Mimi is like a little sun that will make every moment brighter and more fun, while May Pham is so sweet and sincere and open that you'll feel like you've been her friend for years.> Bai Tu Long Bay: Ethnic travel is one of the few companies that brings tour groups here, so we had to share the bay only with fisherman! Despite what Lonely Planet says, this bay is not as spectacular as Halong bay. But it is quiet, peaceful, and still very beautiful. There are some nice beaches and impressive karst mountains, but mostly this is just a relaxing place to take in nature before tourist and Chinese Junk overload hits in Halong bay.> Halong Bay (of course): We were on a Chinese Junk for about 16 hours. Swimming in an otherwise empty cove and taking a Halong route less traveled by other ships were highlights. The great people on our tour and our excellent tour guides made the bay all the better!> The manager of Ethnic travel did take 15 minutes to discuss our entire group's concerns with us back at the office (see cons, below). In the end, his patience and understanding, and a $30 refund, helped make up for some discrepancies between the tour we were promised and the tour we received. Cons:> No Homestay: One reason we chose Ethnic Travel was because of the advertised home-stay in Bai Tu Long Bay. We stayed in a hotel in an off-season Vietnamese resort town. The tour information also talks about opportunities to connect with the people you stay with and help in cooking your dinner. We did help, but we were more in the way than anything and we got the feeling that they would have rather just cooked for us themselves. There were no opportunities to interact with the owners of the hotel.> Too Many People: The ET website claims that tour groups will be no larger than 8 people for the trip we took. When emailing with the manager that number jumped to 10. The morning of our tour that number went to 12 (with a negotiated $10 discount). They broke the group up in Bai Tu Long Bay, but in Halong we had 16 people on our boat that was originally supposed to be 10 (some people were promised 6). This is not a huge issue on it's own (we can live with more people and it wasn't cramped) but it is a symptom of a bigger problem: The manager's inability to say no in order to keep his company's marketing and tour promises. > A lot of driving and waiting: It was clear that ET didn't normally deal with such a large number of people on one tour. The website says 3 1/2 hours driving each way, but does not mention that there is another hour to and from Bai Tu Long Bay (we thought you went by boat). We ended up spending around 12 hours in cars or waiting for something to happen. Too much down time (probably a product of the scattered planning of our over-crowded trip).> Trying to Over-Deliver: We ended up paying $148 for our tour, which seems fair for what we got. The $178 version described to us by the manager and on the website was not received by most on our tour. Part of the problem was that the manager just said \"yes\" to everything anyone requested before the trip, including \"Is there room for me?\" when there was no way to deliver on all of the promises made. Ethnic Travel is on the verge of doing a very good job. They need to work on lining up the product they deliver with the product they promise. Halong and Bai Tu Long bays are amazing, yes. All in all, we really did have a good time, but that and great guides were not enough to make up for the disappointment of not getting what was promised."

We struggled to find the office (there are 2 roads with very similar names in Hanoi) & they insisted on cash payment, but were very helpful & flexible, allowing us to add some extras to their planned itinerary at no extra charge.Zu, our guide, met us at our hotel the following morning. I cannot speak highly enough of her - she was friendly, helpful, knowledgable & excellent company! As she was from the Black Hmong ethic group (from Sapa), but now lives in Hanoi she was able to give an insight into both cultures.The bus to Halong Bay was comfortable - we were only 5 in the mini bus. Our boat was not as flash as some, but the staff on board were friendly & the food was excellent (with particularly impressive vegetable carving!). What was great about our boat compared to some was that the seating area was outdoor on the rear deck, but undercover. The cabins were simple, but clean & functional. Halong Bay is incredible! We loved every minute, including our stop at the floating village, swimming in the bay & kayaking through the caves - amazing!After Halong Bay we did a bit of people swapping (which meant a bit of hanging around), as a couple from Halong Bay were joining us for the Red River Delta, still with Zu. Whilst our group departed back to Hanoi with others from Bai Tu Long. We had planned to do a Home Stay, but were given the option to eat in the home stay & stay in a hotel (which would mean better journey times on day 2 to fit in our amended itinerary to include the monkey sanctuary in the National Park), or to stick the home stay. As the couple we were with had already done one home stay & reported very little sleep due to lack of mattresses we all opted for the hotel option, but had went to a local farmers home for dinner. The cooking experience was fantastic - we made spring rolls & a variety of other dishes. The family makes fresh noodles, so we were able to see this whole process. And whilst they didn't eat with us they helped with the cooking & were around.The hotel was nice enough - nothing flash, but in a great location. The next day was just amazing (despite it being the worst weather of our whole trip! We hadn't really known what to expect from the area around Ninh Bing, but the scenery was spectacular. In the morning we went to Trang An where we were rowed through inland caves - we were literally the only people about which was very special. We did some walking to a local mountain beauty spot & cycling in the local area (where whole villages were smiling & waving!). Lunch was authentic with a local family - fabulous & they were so hospitable!In the afternoon we drove to the National Park & saw the turtle & monkey sanctuaries. The park was amazing & whilst we didn't have time it would have been lovely for hiking. On route back to Hanoi we had a puncture, but a new bus reached us within half an hour - impressive given our location!!I'd definitely recommend Ethnic Travel & especially Zu who made our trip! We also met like minded people which makes group travel much more special."

My boyfriend and I booked two tours with Ethnic Travel - Halong Bay 3 day/2 night and SaPa 3 day/4 night.Our first tour to Halong Bay was such a disappointment. We booked this trip because of the activities (kayaking, trekking, and biking) and what we were promised was not delivered. We were supposed to kayak on day 2 in Halong Bay, but instead the guide said we were going to take the junk boat to a very pretty area and stay on-board to watch the scenery. She said we would kayak the next day, however, that meant we were going to be kayaking in a different area as we left Halong Bay that afternoon. Anyway, the entire group kind of looked at each other helplessly and tried to make the best of it. When our time to kayak finally did arrive, it was awful. They let us off in the most ridiculous place with a fast moving current that was impossible to fight. Luckily, we have kayaked before, but for those who had not, they got nowhere and gave up. With all the quiet bays and calm water, why the hell would they put us in the water here???The next activity, trekking...wait, there was no trekking. I guess they forgot that we were supposed to go on a 10km trek on our final morning.Biking...well, of the 1 hour bike, 45 minutes of it was in complete darkness. I kid you not, we were forced to bike on a sandy road with no light. There were dogs and water buffalo, which was a bit scary, and the guide was way ahead of the rest of the group, so good luck out there. Oh, and no helmets.The itinerary fails to tell you that you're going to be on the junk boat for many hours and there are no chairs outside for you to sit on, except two old wooden ones that have no cushions. Every other boat had an incredible deck - this boat does not. The rooms were really, really nice though and the food was good.If the weather had been better and/or there were nice chairs on the deck to sit-in, it would have been more enjoyable. The homestay on the island was fine - nothing too exciting.Overall, save your money and go with another company. If you don't care about activities, then go with a company that has a nicer boat. If you want activities, then go with another company that will actually give you what you pay for.As for the guides, ours, Thong, was very nice and helpful.SAPA:We were told to arrive at 7pm. It was complete madness and confusion. Finally we were told to come back at 8:30pm. Apparently there were too many people for the train and 3 of us had to go on the later train. Okay, fine, not a big deal - just annoying.Train was fine - no problems.When we arrived in Sapa, the hotel where they dropped us gave us breakfast (an egg and bread) and the rooms where we could shower were less than pleasant. After sitting around for an hour, 2 guides showed-up and there was more confusion as not everyone was doing the 2-night homestay. After another 30 minutes of sitting around, one of the women says \"let's go\" without introducing herself or anything. The other guide was much more cheerful and friendly, so we had bad luck.Our guide walked so fast and never stopped to explain anything. She seemed so distant and disinterested in talking to us. We picked Ethnic travel in hopes of learning about the different groups, etc. I learned NOTHING. Even when we asked questions, she answered in as little words as possible.The trail was beautiful and we really enjoyed the hike. Lunch was bread and eggs (the other group told us they got chicken and rice...not sure why we got a repeat of breakfast). We arrived at the homestay at 3:30pm - 3 hours before the other group. We learned they got to meet people from the villages, go inside houses, hear about the farming, stop at stores, etc. Our guide just made us walk and never talked.When we arrived at the homestay, she left to go visit her family who lives in the same village. We sat around until the other group came.Dinner was fun and good. The accommodations were fine.I woke-up the next morning sick as a dog. I am pretty sure it was dinner as another girl on the tour got sick while trekking a few hours after me.We could not continue the tour. They put us in a van back to Sapa and we booked our own hotel and met the group on the final day for the train ride back to Hanoi. We definitely lost money on this and they were quite indifferent to the situation.We do NOT recommend this travel agency. It's a waste of money and a lie."

We made our own springrolls. Oh and we had pancakes for breakfast. Thanks very much for the great experience!"

During the one day trip we ate at a local family house(the food was great, one of the best in Vietnam and the best springrolls ever) and we went by bike through the countryside. It was a very quite and pleasant day with few or none tourists around. I strongly racommend the 3 days by boat , especially in Bai Tu Long. No tourists around, the boat you travel with is really cosy and cool and the food they give you is great! Ha Long is full of tourist, but we wanted to go there since it is the most famous. It is a really professional travel company, extremely honest and great value for money. If you like to travel with no tourist around having skilled guides just go for it."

So peaceful and beautiful, and relaxing while being fun. Spent a day in a local house and made lunch. pleasant bike ride thru gorgeous countryside. nice trips to the local town and watching local peoples. old temples and squares. checked out some eateries and one fish pond/restaurant in countryside. went to an old war-site hospital underground. checked local wet markets and coffees. Best part was Mr Long-- I dont know if he is still there, but he was the best guide I've had in years of travels. Smart and well informed about Vietnam, about the local area, about the difference between \"tourism\" and \"traveling\". I'm going back to him and/or this company as soon as possible-- totally worth it."

We booked a 3day 2night night trip to Halong Bay with Ethnic Travel, 35 Hang Giay Street, Hanoi. Excellent company - such a professional service and it was worth paying that little bit more. There was only 4 in our group, our guide was fun and told us so much about the area, Vietnam in general and the people. Everything was organised to a tee (from transport to Halong Bay and back to Hanoi) and on time. The food we got was excellent and we got plenty of it! The junk boat we stayed on was very nice and the ngith we stayed with a local family - they brought us off the beaten track, away from other tours and we could tell by the locals they didn't get to see tourists very often! The host family home was lovely and clean (electricity went at 11pm - 6am) and we were fed a feast and got to help prep the dinner. I would highly recommend this company for people who want a good tour, good service and genuine, local, friendly guides who are full of knowledge. Well worth the trip for us!!"

We spent the first night in a Junk on Halong Bay, and the second night was a \"home-stay\" on Quan Lan Island which was well off the beaten track. Halong Bay is magnificent and is a \"must see\", but the reality is also that tourism has taken over and despite restrictions, even overnight in the bay you cannot describe the experience as \"quiet\". Bai Tu Long Bay is markedly unadulterated however, and we were very pleased that our tour took us to this and other lesser travelled sights. If you want to avoid the \"party boats\", eat seafood to die for and see the Vietnam that other tour operators won't take you to see, I would recommend this tour."

There was not a single detail missing. We had zero hiccups. They also provide a good balance between authentic and convenience. They also are very accommodating as they adapted to our changing plans.

My husband and I went on the 4 day Bai Tu Long Bay and Red River Delta trip and highly recommend it. We are usually independent travellers, but Ethnic Travel was able to provide experiences that we could not organise ourselves. The itinerary was very different from the offerings of other tour companies. When dozens of other boats flood Halong Bay like ants, Ethnic Travel takes you to Bai Tu Long Bay - the extension of Halong Bay. This bay was just as beautiful as Halong Bay (at least from pictures that I have seen) but we saw a grand total of ONE other tourist boat and a small number of local ferries and fishing boats. When all the other western tourists visit Tam Coc in droves, we visited the newer alternative Trang An Grotto where the Vietnamese tourists go. The choice of homestays and local meals was excellent, and not something we could do ourselves.Our guide, Ms Pang was very knowledgeable, caring and patient with answering questions about anything we wanted to know about Vietnamese culture. She was a pleasure to travel with. And our mini-bus driver was a great Karaoke singer! Another highlight of the trip was the meticulous planning that goes into the trips. The trip ran extremely smoothly, transitioning easily between cycling, walking, boating, eating and sleeping. Despite the strong organisation of the trip, there was also a high level of flexibility. When I felt tired, the guide immediately offered to get the mini-bus back to pick us up, someone else to collect our bikes, took us back to the hotel and organised an alternative walk for the other travellers. When one of the travellers on our trip wanted to do an alternative activity, a visit to Cuc Phuong National Park, they were able to accommodate this request and we had the choice of also doing this activity or continuing with the set itinerary. The last highlight for us was the food - it was plentiful, variable and delicious. Even on the boat we were served a table full of different dishes. There was always more food than we could eat and they were able to accommodate vegetarians. Loved the fried taro."

My husband and I made a super last minute decision to go to Mu Cang Chai, and of all the tour companies we spoke to, it was clear that Custom Vietnam Travel Tours was the most experienced and thoughtful in proposing an itinerary. Though this tour usually is recommended for 3 days minimum, my husband and I were limited in time and could only do 2 days. The Custom Vietnam Travel team really went out of their way to make it work for us!THE PEOPLEWe booked the tour the day before we left - which seemed daunting at first given the 7-8 hour drive, but LIliana was so helpful in putting the itinerary together and even sending us photos of what Mu Cang Chai looked like (I had been worried that it wouldn't look as expected with most of the rice being harvested) that we couldn't pass up the opportunity! Liliana wasn't pushy at all, and went out of her way to be welcoming - calling after work hours both before the tour to explain the logistics and after the tour to welcome us back to Hoi An.Our tour guide Mr Dung reminded me of a kind history teacher, super nice not only with us but with all the vendors, H'mong school children, and village farmers we met along the way. He was clearly knowledgeable about the area and super excited to share the beauty of the area with us. Our driver was also such a pleasure to work with - he was not only a very safe driver (need to be on those mountain roads!), but also joined in on some of the hikes and picture-taking! THE TOURThe tour itself was really such a unique experience. Our itinerary included a stop at and hike at Xuan Son National Park, a stop at a H'mong village to visit the farmers (No pressure to buy anything as you may find in other village visits; we were really just dropping by to learn a little more about farm life and catch a glimpse of the villagers harvesting rice), and a visit to the biggest rice terraces at La Pan Tan. Even the little break stops for tea and sugarcane juice were charming - including some at small stalls alongside gorgeous tea fields, and fresh juice spots in little towns.The drive itself through Mu Cang Chai was breathtaking, and our driver and Mr. Dung humored me in stopping along the road at various places so I could take pictures of the beautiful terraces and golden rice fields. The landscape at Mu Cang Chai, hidden within the mountains is really unmatched in beauty - from the enormous golden rice terraces up and down the mountain, the water buffalo grazing alongside the river between the hills, and the little houses spotted amongst the terraces spouting wisps of smoke from their cooking fires - this glimpse of life in the mountains was really a unique experience worth 7-8 hour car ride. We caught the end of the rice harvesting season, and though there were only a few fields left that were still golden, it was still a sight to behold as villagers began to plan for tea and corn planting in the terraces following rice season.Thank you team at Custom Vietnam Travel for putting together the most unique experience we had in Vietnam!"

We went on a private tour arranged by Susan at Custom Vietnam Travel that included trekking in Mu Cang Chai, Bac Ha, Hoang Su Phi, and Dong Van Karst Geopark. Our tour also included visits to the Bac Ha and Can Cu markets and a boat tour of Ba Be National Park. About half of our lodging was in homestays and the rest in hotels. The trekking was amazing for the scenery and for the homestay meals and homestay lodging experience. We highly recommend the homestays. Being included in family meals, experiencing the homes of various ethnic peoples, and the kindness of the various hosts is a memorable experience not to be missed. During our two week tour, we did not see another foreigner on any trail, yet we saw absolutely stunning scenery, especially the rice terraces just as harvest was starting.It was such a pleasure working with Susan. We had many interactions in formulating our trip and she worked so diligently to put together a trip based on our interests. Shortly before our trip was to start, we had a family crisis and were close to needing to cancel but Susan was able to reschedule the trip on short notice and we ended up with an amazing experience.The roads thru most of this trip are narrow, windy, and often on very steep mountain sides. We traveled in a very nice Ford Everest SUV and our driver was unbelievable. I have never been with such a skilled driver and I can assure you we were grateful for his driving skills. Our guide, Hoan excelled in every way but in addition, he expressed such excitement for both the grandeur of the scenery and the ethnic people's and also the joy of little details like the beautiful butterflies that it added a lot to our trip. His enthusiasm was infectious and it was great fun to travel with Hoan. I highly recommend planning a trip in this area preferably scheduled when the rice terraces reach their prime. If I were to make any changes to our trip itinerary, I would suggest more homestays. They are a great experience."

Our guide Hung told us all about the crops grown in the area as we walked through the rice paddies on concrete roads. We then went for a pushbike ride around -saw a silk worm factory, they grow the mulberry shrubs -feed the silkworms & let them spin their cocoon. In about 2 months they boil the cocoons, spin the silk & eat the worms. Next we saw them making rice noodles -grind rice to flour add water & extrude it through a machine & dry it in the sun.Hung, was very interesting to talk with -he knew so much about the local village & Vietnamese life giving us a real insight into this beautiful country. We would recommend this trip as a day tour out of Hanoi, suitable for just about anyoneIf you don't want to ride a bike they will drive you around the tracks"

The guide and driver were at the hotel early, the guide (Phuoc/John) spoke really good English with a very clear pronunciation, and the driver drove calmly and respectfully- he was quite unflappable! We felt in good hands :)We had a walk / sampan / bike tour including countryside, a temple in a cave, and village life with a great deal of context and cultural and religious explanation from Phuoc. Lunch was outstanding.We were really pleased with our day. Do let them know your level of fitness - we would happily have bicycled further and faster.We also really enjoyed that we were allowed to experience every part of the tour with a sense of discovery and surprise- felt far more fun and memorable.Recommended!"

            "review": "Great Travel Service with Fantastic staff and guides. We recently traveled to Vietnam and booked several day tours and overnight trips through Custom Vietnam Travel (CVT). The entire experience with CVT was great, from our very first email, inquiring about their services, to our final trip to the airport for our return flight home. We have an 11 hour time difference with Hanoi. I sent my first email at 9pm and woke up the next morning to Susan Nguyen's response to my inquiry. That immediate attention set the tone for the rest of our correspondence. This was a first visit to Vietnam for our adopted 9 year old daughter and Susan worked with me to plan just the right amount of touring and relaxation time for all of us. She contacted the orphanage in the province where our daughter is from and made arrangements for us to visit. She was thoughtful enough to inquiry about the ages and number of children now living there so that we could bring age appropriate books, toys and treats. The trips Susan arranged were perfect. She let me know, when I suggested a specific Ha Long Bay cruise operator, that she wasn't familiar with that organization and was having trouble reaching them by phone. The cruise she ultimately arranged for us was perfect! Definitely one of the highlights of our trip. Susan didn't bat an eye when, the day before we were scheduled to take an overnight train from Danang to Hanoi, we called and said we wanted to save time and fly instead. Literally, within 15 minutes of our emailing her, she had made all the new arrangements, including the extra night in a hotel.When we first arrived in Vietnam, were met at the airport by a guide and driver, Chung and Kong (sorry about any misspelling of names :-)). Both were fantastic, friendly and knowledgeable and genuine nice guys. Chung's wife gave birth to his first child (a daughter!) while were were there so he handed us off to Kim Tran for the rest of our guided trips. Kim was amazing! He is a kind, gently soul and a truly beautiful person. He shared with us many thoughtful insights about the temples and pagodas we toured and also about his life and family. Kim and Kong were super with our daughter. She took a shine to them both and by the end of our days with them, we felt like they were both big brothers to her. We plan to travel back to Vietnam in a few years and we will definitely work with CVT again!"

In August 2016, my husband and I and another couple went on a 17-day tour of Vietnam and Cambodia arranged by Custom Vietnam Travel (Minh was our direct contact---a very capable and accommodating young lady). We had a van with driver and English-speaking tour guide accompanying us throughout. Custom Vietnam Travel provided a fabulous itinerary. We saw varied sights\u2014ancient, religious, fine arts (traditional dancing and singing, puppet show, modern dance) and diverse locations and landscapes\u2026from mountains to waterways\u2026to major cities. Vietnam Travel suggested fun activities like street food tours by walking to each spot in Hanoi and taking a Vespa in Saigon. Those experiences were fabulous! Not only that, they made sure that we tried varied modes of transport\u2014rickshaw, hiking, bicycling, boat, moped, tuk-tuk, etc. When a typhoon prevented us from going on our overnight cruise on Ha Long Bay, Viet Nam Tours rearranged our itinerary so that we could fly back after the typhoon and take our cruise then. (They even upgraded us!) In all, we traveled on 5 inland air flights and stayed in 7 hotels. Hotels were great and accommodated us perfectly, and the meals they arranged were excellent\u2026and filling! We had in total 5 different tour guides who each had a good command of English and quite knowledgeable. When our flights landed in Hanoi, Saigon, Da Nang, Phnom Penh, and Siem Reap, our tour guide was always on time and holding a sign indicating our group. Lam in Hanoi was especially an incredible guide! Our trip was unforgettable, and we all wholeheartedly agree, that Custom Vietnam Travel was a fantastic choice!"

I recommend Custom Vietnam Travel without reservation.Planning and booking our trip to Vietnam there are series of lotteries you have to enter to ensure you are going to get value for money from your venture. One of those lotteries is planning excursions. I can honestly say that we got lucky when I found Custom Vietnam Travel. Throughout the planning and booking process you were confident with the product you were purchasing and no matter how many emails you send you will always get a polite and professional reply back pretty quickly. The tours themselves were very good, our drivers were excellent and tour guide, Lam, exuded enthusiasm and knowledge, and he is a great asset to the company. The only grumble we could have was trying to find their office, in the end we gave up, sat in a caf\u00e9 and got Susan to come and find us.If we return to Vietnam Custom Vietnam Travel will be the first webpage I visit after booking the plane tickets."

Minh quickly responded with a quality programme which we have just completed; this covered Hanoi, Halong bay, Hue, Hoi An, Saigon and the Mekong Delta across several different hotels and three different guides for the North, Central and South respectively. We enjoyed the holiday of a lifetime without the hassle of big groups and will almost certainly be back some day with CVT. Nothing seems too much trouble for Minh, the guides were all good including Bien, and particularly Thuy in Saigon who was charming, energetic and knowledgeable.A very good customer focused operation who deserve their evident success..."

Together with our 15 year old daughter and 13 year old son, we had a very happy and memorable holiday, which exceeded our expectations in so many ways. We started planning our holiday with the help of Minh from the Hanoi office. She provided exceptional service via email answering all our questions and responding to all our requests. It was lovely to have the opportunity to meet Minh in person, while we were in Hanoi. Thank you once again for helping us with our planning and for the professional, seamless way our holiday came together. All the guides and drivers were professional, punctual, reliable and enhanced the experience of travelling, by making all the arrangements so easy so you could make the most of being in the moment.We started our trip in Ho Chi Minh, where we had Hoa, as our guide and Minh as our driver. We appreciated them orientating us to all the new experiences and assisting us to have a very comfortable start to the trip. Hoa was wonderful in explaining the war history and guiding us across the busy roads. She even came to the airport and to help us find the right check in counter for our flight to DaNang, which felt like we were saying goodbye to a friend. We were met in DaNang by our guide Phong and driver Lin for our short drive to Hoi An. We loved the relaxed atmosphere in this part of the country and had the best day visiting the Red Bridge Cooking School and going for a bike ride in the surrounding countryside. Thank you for the suggestions about places to eat - they were amazing!On arrival in Hanoi we were met at the airport by Smiley and given some wonderful information about Hanoi on the way to our hotel. All the accommodation recommended for our trip was well located and offered excellent rooms and wonderful service. Our guide for the remainder of our trip was Loi and our driver was Tuin. We were so grateful to them both for everything they did to make our time in Hanoi, Sapa and Halong Bay safe and fun! Loi was very generous in sharing his knowledge of the history, culture and optimism about the future of Vietnam. It was wonderful to visit all the sights in Hanoi and a memorable experience to go trekking in Sapa with Loi. Tuin was a considerate, careful and patient driver, who kept us safe while truck and bus drivers played chicken on the highway!! Custom Vietnam Travel is highly recommended for anyone planning a trip to Vietnam. Looking at our photos makes us want to come back!"

Unbelievable value!!!I recently was in Hanoi for business and spent one day with Custom Vietnam Travel Day Tours. My guide, Smiley, and our driver Trung picked me up at my hotel at 7:30 am in a nice air conditioned SUV and we drove to Ninh Binh for a day of awesome experiences, stopping at a local cafe on the way for coffee. Smiley shared volumes of Vietnamese history and local insights on the 2 hr drive. We first when on a riverboat tour to Tam Coc, then walked to a temple and through the village Karst, ate a phenomenal authentic lunch, and went for a bike ride through rice paddies and other parts of Karst before heading back to Hanoi. My favorite part of my trip to Vietnam is the day I spent with Smiley learning about Vietnamese culture and history, and seeing some of its beautiful countryside. I felt like I was having a fun day with an old friend. I have so many great memories of the day!! I hope I can return with my family in the future and see you again. How lucky am I!!"

We thoroughly enjoyed the tour to four traditional villages namely, Tho Pa, where they make rice papers, Dong Ho (painting village), Dong Ky (wood furniture village), and Bat trang (pottery village). Among the four, we enjoyed best Tho Pa because we met a local named Mr. Viet and his family who are so welcoming. They made us try to make rice paper, offered us rice wine they made, and had a singing session with Mr. Viet using traditional musical instruments. It was really a great experience. Because it was high noon, we really were not able to walk fully in the Dong Ky village . Mr. Lam, our guide, is very good and kind. He tells us a lot about the culture and history of Vietnam and Hanoi in particular. Mr. Tho, the driver, is also very kind and thoughtful. When we had lunch, he even wiped the utensils for us and he always thinks for the welfare of my baby. This tour is perhaps the highlight of our trip in Hanoi. For improvement, the guide and driver could have familiarized themselves with the road and local restaurants better to spend less time asking locals if we're taking the right road (we actually did take the right roads). No big hassle but the experience would be better. All in all, it is highly recommended."

After what seemed to be endless weeks of researching amongst the plethora of travel agencies available on Trip Advisor and recommendations from travel blogs, my husband and I decided to go with Custom Vietnam Day Travel Tours based on their reviews and comprehensive itineraries. Boy- did we get much more than that!It was a great pleasure to work with with our superb travel specialist, Minh Ninh. Despite the number of multiple email exchanges whereas I had many questions throughout the process of inquiring about possible tour visits and details, Ms. Minh was consistently quick and prompt with her responses (which I appreciate ever so much. In fact, we chose Custom Vietnam over another tour group because of her responsiveness. The other group was a bit too slow for me and didn't outrightly express a genuine interest to want our business). Minh was wonderful throughout our correspondences and made every effort to accommodate our tour preferences. We booked two tours (Mu Cang Chai & Ho Chi Minh Tunnels) with Custom Vietnam Travel, one of which was booked last minute and Minh made sure to take care of us despite the spur of the moment changes to our travel plans. This ensured that we had a pleasurable stay in Vietnam and for that we are extremely grateful for her! We even had the pleasure of meeting her in person at our hotel which added a delightful touch to our first day in Vietnam. She is as pleasant as a cup of freshly brewed egg coffee and we are ever so thankful to have the business of working with her on our first trip to Vietnam. Oh my. The Mu Cang Chai tour had to be the biggest highlight of our Vietnam trip. If you are debating between Sapa vs. Mu Cang Chai, please go with the latter for the rice terraces. On this trip, we had the very great pleasure and honor of meeting Nang Cong who is HANDS DOWN the best tour guide EVER. We've been on several tour groups before (private and group) and Nang continued to show his excellence of knowledge, scope, professionalism, timeliness and every single quality necessary for us to enjoy our trip as much as possible. Not to mention, his humor, amicability, sweetness and liking for food with us as foodies made it the perfect combination we could ever ask for in a tour guide turned friend :) Although the private tour was short (2 nights and 3 days), we learned a plethora of information about Mu Cang Chai and fell in love with the history, Hmong people and the essence of Vietnam. Nang was such a pleasure to be around day in and day out, whilst being extremely patient as we snapped thousands of photos, to making sure bathroom breaks were available for this small bladdered girl, educated us on the arduous process of maintaining and growing rice fields, to even ensuring that we tried all of the local delicious ethnic foods and fruits in the area after seeing how much we liked to eat. OH. And he introduced us to the amazing spicy, garlic sauce that which is known as CHIN SU. The best sauce in the world that has now become my replacement of Sriracha! You're missing out travel friends if you haven't tried this yet!!! I'm getting excited thinking of it. Nang is the most thoughtful and considerate person we've worked with and he definitely contributed to the wonderful experience we had overall in this beautiful country. We are so thankful to have worked with the perfect tour guide for this trip and were very much sad to conclude this portion of our journey. Because of Custom Vietnam Travel and their excellence in formulating perfect tour itineraries and their extreme professionalism, we will surely make another trip back to this wondrous country and will definitely keep this tour group in mind. There is just too much to see! Thank you so much Custom Vietnam Travel for making our trip so memorable!"

It has been few months since we went to Vietnam for our Honeymoon, and since we r from middle east, the normal process was to book our honeymoon through one of our local travel agencies, however i preferred to go through internet and try to find a local vietnamese travel agency that better knows the country and points of interest, i emailed so many companies in Vietnam and got many replies, however Custom Vietnam was the best in terms of cooperation, prices and simply making everything i wished possible to us specially that i wanted a tailor made itinerary, our agent was Susan Nguyen a very kind and collaborative lady, who never hesitated in helping, supporting and replying my requests even out of working hours. She was always ready to help, change itinerary and get best prices for me. And although you can read about many fraud companies around Vietnam, we didn't hesitate to transfer money overseas to this company which is well trusted by all means. All this was before traveling to our Honeymoon. As for the days we spent there during our 13 days Honeymoon, i would say that i could never ask for anything more, the itinerary was exactly as we agreed, yet they surprised us many times with extra nice things. and even during our stay, Susan was always ready for any changes or modifications.. She surely made our Honeymoon unforgettable.I would like to thank Custom Vietnam for their great efforts and specially Susan for all what she did. We really enjoyed each and every day we spent in Vietnam because of your high cooperation and high follow up and care. Thanks again from me and my husband for you and the whole team, and wish you a good life and success."

I have done several trips to the far North including Sa Pa, Lao Cai, Ha Giang, Cao Bang, Ha Long with Smiley as my personal tour guide. Those trips have been truly outstanding because of the opportunities to go 'off the beaten track' to visit remote mountainous communities of ethnic minority people, where we did not see another foreigner.The highlight being the way we stopped randomly along the way to talk with local people, or share a simple meal. The opportunity to learn more about the extraordinary history of the country from Smiley was very special. His knowledge and command of the English language is impressive and has given me insight and understanding about Vietnamese people that I will always value. Smiley also has a superb sense of humour that makes travelling in a car for sometimes 6-8 hours not difficult. In my experience it was such fun as the countryside and people were stunning to see and although I sometimes wanted to rest my eyes I was always reluctant just in case I missed something along the way - the sense of adventure just around the corner was always present.I have recommended Custom Vietnam Travel to my family, friends and acquaintances.

Her response to our emails whilst in the preparation of our itinerary was swift and concise. We added and changed our itinerary as we were researching places we wanted to visit and Susan put it all together as per our requests.Susan met us at the hotel in Hanoi and we had time to spend with her to confirm all the details. She gave us a local mobile phone so that if at any time we needed to contact her we could. (This was returned via our last driver before leaving Vietnam).Susan chose our hotels for us in the areas we asked to stay in and this included a pick up from airports and railway stations. The tour bus (small van seating 10) were all great with air con and adequate room for our private tour of 6 people. The tour guides who met us and took us around as per our itinerary were all great.Susan personally went with us to check in to the train at Hanoi station for our overnight train trip to Danang. She also organised all our requirement letters for our visa.We absolutely recommend Susan Nguyen from Custom Vietnam Travel for all travel requirements in Vietnam."

This agency worked with us to arrange for guides, lodging, restaurants and activities throughout Vietnam at the cities- areas of our choosing. We were met at the airport by an agent who helped us through the Visa process and then assisted by knowledgeable guides at each of our locations. Custom Vietnam Travel arranged for great hotels, restaurants, and activities at each stop and all internal flights and transfers. We toured Ho Chi Minh City, Siem Reap (Cambodia), Hoi An, Hue, Sapa,Hanoi, and took a 3 day boat trip in beautiful Halong Bay. The guides at each location were extremely knowledgeable and fun. Plus, the whole trip was very reasonably priced. I strongly recommend that you consider Custom Vietnam Travel when you make your pilgrimage to Vietnam-- where the people are hard-working and friendly and the food is to die for. Ask for Ms. Liliana to set up your trip. Ask for Lam as your Hanoi tour guide."

No detail was left to chance. Everything (hotel selections, tour guides, drivers, site seeing) was exceptional. Throughout the trip my group (who left the planning to myself and another person) kept saying, \"How did you find this company? They are superb. We are so lucky.\" I guarantee you will not be disappointed in hiring them to plan and execute your trip to Vietnam and Cambodia. Also, I wanted to thank Dung, Dinh, Hoang, Duc, Tai and Toi (guide, captain and crew) of the Prince 2 with Indochina Junk for 2 wonderful days and nights in Halong Bay. The special dinner, rose petals, and amazing carvings in commemoration of the honey mooners who happen to share the boat with us will never be forgotten. Thank you so much."

This gave us the possibility to visit remote, but even more impressive places and caves off the beaten trek.It was very easy to organize the general issues such as route, hotel, price, services etc. in advance from Austria just by E-Mail.

The guides were very friendly, which is key when you're using a tour agency service, and everything went very smoothly.I'm a solo traveler and booked their service a month ago as I traveled to Hanoi and Nha Trang. Even though I can be quite demanding when it comes to...well...everything, they checked off all the criteria. Examples of the excellent services:- Checked in at the hotel for me- Checked in at the airport- When the initial hotel room was loud and noisy (it was located on the 3rd floor), the tour operator (Susan) spoke with the hotel manager and we switched to a room in the 8th floor, which was a difference between hell and heaven- Flexible schedule. One day I had a problem with my contact lenses and had to buy some new ones. The guide knew exactly where the store was and took them 5 minutes to fix this annoying problem. If it was there alone, it would've been a lot of hassle.- Humble and friendly guides- Selected interesting sights and locations according to my needs, which you will give to them- Selected great 5 star hotels for me, especially the one in Nha Trang called Mia Resort, where you have access to a private beach right from your door room- Each meal consisted of 7-8 dishes. I seriously gained a bit of weight after the 9 day trip. It's like they're paranoid you'll starve to death. If I go to the countries they provide their service in the future, I'll surely use them again. It's not just Vietnam which they operate in, which is great!Having said that, here are just a few things they can improve in the future. No company is perfect. I want to present both side of the story to make it very clear. - They could improve the English skill of the guides. Now, don't get me wrong, they spoke ok English, but if it's better, our communication would be a breeze. - The Vietnam accent might be a bit hard to understand for non natives, so be prepared for that. These two improvements are not a big deal, but they would make the trip a 100% perfect. Overall, great experience, friendly staff who attend to your details, and worth the price!"

I was scouting for a suitable holiday destination where we could bring the kids to learn about another country's sights, history and culture, and I had a relatively short period of time to plan and book tickets etc (less than 2 weeks). I wasn't sure whether Hanoi would be a suitable place to visit with young children but after an online chat with Susan Nguyen whilst browsing Custom Vietnam website, I was quite convinced that the trip is doable and would be interesting for our kids aged 10, 8 & 5 years old. Susan proposed an itinerary for us based on what we wanted out of the trip. We ended up with a 3.5 days tour covering Ninh Binh, Hanoi city, Halong Bay and Bat Trang pottery village. They threw in a free airport pick up and drop off for us as well as we booked all our tours with them. Everything went smooth.We were met at the airport by our driver and I received a welcome call from Susan. She met up with us at the hotel when we arrived and was very kind to recommend some good eating places nearby.Our guide was Hung. Good English and very knowledgeable with regards to the history, culture and politics of Vietnam. He was eager to tell us about his country. The children liked him as he was very patient with the children's queries and very friendly. He was also always thinking about our safety and we highly appreciate it. For example, he remembered about our life jackets before we went on our Tam Coc sampan ride (I totally forgot about it though I had specifically requested Susan to include the life jackets when we were planning the trip). He also helped us with crossing the streets when my little girl had a little emergency and had to use the loo at one of the street vendor's 'home' in the city. We had a street food tour and the places he brought us to try local Vietnamese food were clean and tasty (try the glass noodles with eel and the local dessert). The kids enjoyed the cyclo ride around Hanoi. It's good for going around the old quarters and observing the locals' way of life without having to worry about crossing the streets. The boat ride at Halong Bay and visit to the cave was good too! I think the only thing the kids didn't quite enjoy was the car ride (are we there yet? How much longer?). I mentioned to Susan about the younger girls being a bit picky about food and what they might prefer whereas for us and my eldest, we would be more adventurous with food. I was very happy to note that all the restaurants/ food outlets we went to were in line with our requirements. The weather was nice and cool. We were there from 27-31 March. Susan and Hung mentioned it was coming to end of Spring. Susan also did mention that Halong Bay would be a bit foggy in this weather. It was indeed foggy most of the time I. Hanoi and other places we went. It was alright though as we much prefer travelling/walking/ climbing in cool weather than in hot weather.Overall, we throughly enjoyed our trip to Hanoi thanks to Hung and Susan. The children enjoyed it so much that they want to go back to Hanoi and request for Hung as their guide again."

The first day, we visited Perfume Pagoda and second day a Hanoi city tour. They arranged the guide, driver, site entry tickets and lunch for both days. We were picked up at our hotel ~7:30 both days and dropped off around 5 in time for dinner. The whole process went smoothly and was slightly better value than what my hotel was offering for similar trip.Tom was our guide for both days, and he did an excellent job. He was extremely knowledgeable about the sites we were visiting and Vietnamese history of all eras. I would recommend him highly for tours in and around Hanoi. He also gave us some great restaurant recommendations for dinner after the trips. We were a family of 4 with 2 small kids, and Tom really made us feel welcome and comfortable throughout the trip.Minh was the tour agent, and she was very responsive to my questions. We did have to switch the itinerary at the last minute as the Hanoi tour was scheduled for Monday when several sites were closed. This was handled without issue. I was provided a mobile phone, and Minh checked on me after the first day to make sure the trip was going smoothly. Lunches were arrange by Custom Vietnam, and the food was good. If I had to do it over again, I probably would have kept my option open for lunch to keep more flexibility on timing and meal location, but this is a minor issue. Overall we were very satisfied with the service and would recommend using them again."

The hotels were good and the Halong Bay cruise was great.I managed to lose my ATM card right at the beginning of the trip - Minh immediately helped as much as possible in making sure that i was able to get a replacement at a hotel later in the trip. Having the supplied phone to be able to call CVT was also very helpful (though i ended up getting a sim card for my own phone (very cheap). Throughout the whole process and trip CVT, and Minh especially, were great and very supportive. I was able to have private tours where wanted and free time where i wanted it. Very flexible.

I have to say, the company exceeded my expectations of what a tour company would do for us. From the early liaison re the 22 day itinerary, with options bouncing back and forth between Vietnam and Australia, to the trip itself, with a great guide for each stage of the trip, and a very personal focus from Lien in the Sales office before and during the tour, supporting us and the guide if we wanted to make changes or there was a hiccup (eg excessive wind on Ha Long Bay). I really didn't expect the level of interaction and support we got from the whole team through the tour. The tour itself was great. Really interesting, with lots of great experiences which we could all appreciate, which I thought might be a challenge with a 12yo, 18yo and us parents, but it worked well. Can't recommend this company highly enough."

Recently, my 18th year old daughter planned an extensive 2 week trip to northern Vietnam for the whole family. After researching thoroughly and developing a comprehensive itinerary, she picked Customer Vietnam Travel based on TripAdvisor to pull the whole trip bookings together. We were initially apprehensive as this was her first time organizing our holiday and we left it totally to her. But right from the start our worries were put to rest as we got the most responsive engagement from our contact Susan Nguyen, who then pulled together all the detailed planning, bookings, made great recommendations. We had the most enjoyable holiday with everything privately organised for the family, from Hanoi, to Nim Binh, to a private overnight junk in Halong Bay ending in Sapa. It was exactly to what we wanted - trekking, cycling through villages, kayaking through limestone caves, having lunch on a clam fishing hut on stilts at the mouth of the red river, friendly home stays etc etc.......many off the beaten track places away from maddening hoards of tourists you wouldn't normally find from other tour organisers. The two guides we had - Binh for Hanoi-Halong, and Mei Nee for Sapa spoke excellent english, were so well informed and educational, great fun to be with, flexible/adaptable to the family, and literally felt like part of our family by the end of the trip. Custom Vietnam Travel ranks as the BEST travel agent we have ever had - and we don't always use agents because they seldom do a good job for our very tailored and out-of-the-way itinerary. Well done Susan and team, we have since personally recommended you to many friends who followed our holiday with envy on Facebook. Stay the way you are even as we wish you all the best and success in your business."

We had booked 3 items with custom vietnam travel, namely a Ha Long Bay Cruise (3d2n), a mekong delta tour (2d1n) and a transfer from Hoi An to Hue. The Mekong delta tour was very well arranged from beginning to end and we had a friendly guide who was very accomodating. The delta tour by itself is very very touristy and you are herded from one spot to the next. I would personally recommend others to take a more relaxed/alternative way to visit the mekong region - I heard some great stories about biking past the villages. The Ha long bay tour was again very well arranged (With carina cruises) and we vThe transfer from hoi an to Hue was a bit of a dissapointment. Our driver spoke no english and was clearly keen to just get us from hoi an to hue as quickly as possible. He tried to drop us at a marble store instead of marble mountain. When we said we wanted marble mountain, not the store, he brought us there but afterwards raced to hue with only 2 quick stops for photos. All the great stops and sights that people using other agencies were raving about, like beaches and waterfalls, were lost on us. I'd have a look around for another more extensive daytrip, where you really get the time to get out of the car and with a guide who speak english. All in all, the service of susan/custom VN was very good - she's very responsive and quick to help. If you're willing to pay a bit more to let someone else make the arrangements, this company will give you a great peace of mind that everything is done well."

We were interested in travelling throughout Vietnam and visiting Angkor Wat in Cambodia for a 30 day period in December and January 2015-16.I looked at reviews on tripadvisor and found a guide - Smiley Nguyen - who was given an excellent review.I emailed him and quickly got a response. I explained that as a serious amateur photographer, I wanted to spend the majority of the vacation traveling through the countryside, getting to meet the people and to spend very little time in cities. Smiley is an experienced guide and the owner of Custom Vietnam Travel. Within 10 hours, we had the outline of an agenda. After reviewing it, he arranged all the flights, hotels, home stays, private drivers and private guides. We then spoke over Skype to clarify issues and concerns we had about travelling to Vietnam.We just returned from Vietnam. It was an amazing experience, getting to know the local people and learning so much about the country and especially photographing the people and landscapes.We chose to stay at 4 star hotels, when available, but also enjoyed the home stays, which gave us intimate knowledge of the local people, who are incredibly open, welcoming and in touch with the land.When we had a problem with one of the flights, due a mismatch between our passport and the ticket (our fault, since one had a middle name and the other didn't), I used the phone he gave me, called tthe office, and they cancelled and reissued the ticket while we waited for 5 minutes. Truly professional service and concer.As you can tell, we were highly pleased with Smiley and all the guides and drivers. I would recommend his agency to anyone travelling to Vietnam or Cambodia. I told him he can also give our names to anyone wanting a reference. We are Canadians from Montreal."

It was relatively easy to plan the trip After 6 emails, we have the itinery tied down, I sent out the 20% deposit feeling we are in good, capable hands. The experience was beyond our expectations. We arrived Hanoi with a lower expectation knowing the country is still an infant in its tourism. We spent 75% of the time travelling the countryside. The 2 homestay experience was superb. One of the home stay owner was a Vietnam Cong Commando, I learn the war history very quickly. Smilely, the business owner, was our guide. We had him by fate, all the guides are booked for the busy season. He normally has to do the office chores"

Excellent service.Our guide, Hung, was great at telling us all about life in Vietnam and ensuring we had plenty of photo stops and enjoyed good local food for lunch as he picked the restaurants carefully for us. Because of our itinerary, there was a lot of driving but they still suggested little detours for us to see more or more scenic routes, even though it meant longer days and more work for them.We saw and experienced so much that we never would have on a big tour or independently and will always be grateful to our driver and Hung for being such great people to do the trip with. We did the trip over a month ago and still regularly talk about our conversations with Hung over dinner- a truly memorable and fun part of our holiday."

You can read about the tour on the website.....Pros. Excellant communication (they even phoned to check we were okay in the heat, nice). Prompt pickup, friendly and knowledgable guide.Cons. Watch the heat, also check time of year as their are various religious celebrations where it can get quite busyTips. Sunhat, block, plenty of water....also the metal boat has metal seats so take a cushion or something to sit on, the boat trip is by rowing only and is very slow..................and quiet long. If reasonably hot take an umbrella as well....and of course sensible shoes....."

I recently returned from a 2.5 week trip to the northern part of Vietnam, visitng places that are quite remote and \"less-travelled\" as well as more popular destinations. The planning went on for three months prior to the trip. During that time, I must have exchanged at least 100 emails with Ms Susan (Hien) Nguyen at CVT. She is amazing!!! Throughout the pre-trip planning, and during the actual trip, she was extremely patient, and knowledgeable.Some of my numerous question must have made her think, \"Oh no! Not again!\" but she never was anything but generous and gracious in sharing her knowledge, even when it wasnt specifically about places on my itinerary. Spending time with her several times in Hanoi during the trip was a delight--like meeting a dear friend. She's kind, and sweet, and caring about her clients, as well as proud of and enthusiastic about her country! When she says she really wants you to have a great time in Vietnam, she means it!! In addition to helping me plan a somewhat unusual itinerary, she gave great practical help.For example, whnone place I'd chosen (against her advice) didnt work out, she was able to not only get a last minute refund, but also book me into another place at a much better rate than I'd have got myself. She was always a phone call away, via the cell phone she provides to clients for use during their trips.She promised me I'd have a great guide, and sure enough, she found one of the country's very best: Mr. Loi Tran Nam. He is awesome--a wonderful guide and person.The two drivers used by CVT on my trip, including on some very hair-raising mountainside roads, were excellent.With Ms Susan Nguyen, and a great guide, and safe drivers, I felt extremely well taken care of on my first ever trip to Vietnam.

We made boat tours both in the Van Longh and Tam Coc areas and cycled around Ninh Binh.Following this part of the trip we went back to Halong Bay where Smiley managed to book a cruise for us through the Bay (the initial cruise was cancelled due to the severe weather conditions in the Norther Vietnam region late July/early August).Other parts of Vietnam we visited without a guide but hotel accommodation was arranged through Smiley and his company. The hotels ranged from good to absolutely fantastic, especially Pilgrimage Village in Hue and Victoria in Can Tho stood out. If you ever go to Vietnam and you need a guide you will not be disappointed to engage with Smiley; he is very friendly, pleasant, very knowledgeable and dedicated to exceed the expectations. I would like to recommend Smiley and his team if you ever visit Vietnam. If we return to the region I do not need to spent time anymore for a good guide as I would immediately contact Smiley. I would like to thank Smiley, Fiona and our driver Tuan for the great time in Vietnam!"

Each detail was taken care of, even to the point that one of the restaurants we were taken to already knew that my husband doesn't eat celery. When plans needed to be changed in Ha Long Bay, when weather cancelled our cruise, Susan had an alternative plan ready. (We got a partial refund at the end of the trip since the cruise did not happen.) The hotels and restaurants she chose were fantastic. Our guide Duc was very knowledgeable, patient and fun to be around; it was great to know he was looking out for us. The driver was excellent. Thank you all!"

When looking for a company to help us in planning a trip to Vietnam a full year before we were about to travel, I sent inquiries to several companies who had all been recommended to me. I let them all know that I was making plans for a family trip to Vietnam, but our travel plans were still a year away. A few companies responded (yes, there were some who never replied to my request) but when I sent some follow-up questions, Custom Vietnam Travel was the only one to reply again and they were that responsive to my every question and concern during the entire year of planning the trip. Once we got to Vietnam, everything was flawless. We started by spending four days in Saigon. Our guide, Lee, was knowledgeable, dependable, and always willing to do more than what was originally planned at a moments notice. Custom Vietnam Travel even made arrangements for us to go to the orphanage where our daughter lived when we adopted her. Lee did a great deal to make this visit go well and he was understanding and responsive to everyone involved. The second part of our trip was four days in the northern part of the country and we had an equally knowledgeable and dependable guide during our time in the north. Lam was very fun-loving and took such good care of all of our needs. Our time in Hanoi and our trips to Ninh Binh and Halong Bay were amazing. I have nothing but the highest regard for everyone we dealt with connected to Custom Vietnam Travel. Susan was the main person who made all of our arrangements and monitored our trip from beginning to end. The amount of dedication, care, and professionalism she showed over the last year has been remarkable. I would whole-heartedly recommend Custom Vietnam Travel."

The drivers were also professional.

Always friendly, patient and quick to respond, this process was very easy. This company came highly recommended to us by my partner's parents. We were concerned as we are more budget travellers than they are. However, Susan custom made our fantastic itinerary for us and made it very affordable. For around 1800 USD for two people, it comprised of 2 days in Ho Chi Minh, 2 days in Can Tho and the Mekong, a 2 night/3 day boat trip in Ha Long and a 2 day experience in Sapa (including the night train trips). All of these were incredibly memorable and will remain with us for a long time.Without going into great detail, the tours provided us with great insight into Vietnam life and culture, made everything very convenient for us during the time. We didn't have to think of anything regarding transport and accommodation. We had our own tour guides and drivers. They really bend over backwards to make your time in Vietnam a memorable one. I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone travelling Vietnam."

By some fluke, going into my 4th cruise, I connected with Cruise Critic,and found a complete system for connecting with other would be passengers on an upcoming cruise. By shear luck, as we had booked last minute, the roll call system led us to individuals who had done some groundwork searching for excursions on the Vietnam portion of our cruise. These were like minded individuals who did not want to be captive of the overpriced excursions doled out by the cruise line The four excursions which we did with Custom Vietnam travel, Saigon, Hue, Duc Village and Halong Bay, were exceptional. As well, we found that the guides provided , overall were quite competent and knwoledgeable, as well with a fair command of English in order to communicate.As I have the names mixed up for the moment, i do not quite remember who was who for Saigon ,Hue or halong Bay. However the requirements were different for each, that is to say that , Halong bay was exceptional , with or without a guide.We had Nguyen Van Nghia, \"Rohan\" , Tony Hoa, and LoiA few things one should know.The transport was always on time and provided enough time to get a taste of each of the destinations, which is all one can do when visiting a major city for an 8 hour excursion.This is important particularly in Vietnam, unlike some Mediteranean or Caribean locations , as the ports here are not close to the destinations. This also provided ample time to get to know the 3 guides , and at the same time give them a chance to fill you in on the history, the current situation, the people, and the countryside.The timing was also very precise so that there is never any anxiety about not being a cruise authorized tour, therefore a fear of missing the ship. All the private companies are in business, and they know how the ships operate, and they are there to get you out and back on time. They are not fly by night drivers.The whole system with Custom Vietnam Travel was professional and well handled, from on line booking, ALWAYS next day (overnite ) responses to any questions , and politeness on all counts. I felt at all times that we were dealing just around the corner. Any concerns or accomadations which were required en route were handled expertly by communication of the driver to the dispatch office.My comments here are about the company , which is the point of Trip Advisor, to instill confidence in whom you are dealing with. The tours themselves cover all the important items that one may want to see in the short visit, and they are listed in the itinerary and speak for themselves.The drivers know when to make photo stops, nature calls, and foreign exchange stops for those in need.As in any touring operation, there are some places that through the grapevine become \"the place to shop and visit, eg the Pearl Factory, the Lacqueur factory , , the bamboo factory.the drivers will ask you if you want to go, however you have the choice (based on an agreement of the other 14-16 passengers on the bus , and it is left up to you.We realize that tour operators all over the world are solicited by companies to bring in bus loads for their busineses,but you now have a choice, so the message is opt out.In short, great tours, beautiful locations, great drivers, (they really know how to get through the traffic) great guides, and great smaller vehicles, so you do not have a delay with 45 -50 getting on and off for every picture.Great company.I wish they had soul mates or associates in every country I were to visit in the future"

But on a recommendation, I reached out to Fiona at Custom Vietnam Day Tours. She was incredibly responsive, as we traded emails for a few days, and I decided to use them. Wow, great decision!Fiona asked what I liked and wanted to accomplish -- meeting people, culture, photography, food, getting off-the-beaten path. She tailored an itinerary to just that.A driver picked me up at the airport and drove me to the Sheraton Hanoi, where Fiona met me to review the plan. There was still time for a 3+ hour culinary tour of the Old Quarter in Hanoi, as Lam, my excellent guide for the trip, walked us around his city. We stopped at his favoirte little places for everything from eel soup to spring rolls to pho, and finished the night by relaxing at \"beer corner.\" There were many photo ops in lantern street, bamboo street, etc. Great start.Day Two was spent around the villages at Ninh Binh. After a 2.5-hour drive we were in a different world. Our sampan boat lady took Lam and me for a river and cave cruise. In 2 hours we met one other boat. Then a delicious 9-course lunch overlooking the village. The afternoon featured a bicycle ride through the rice paddies out to a temple carved into the mountain. Unbelievable.Day Three was more of the same, starting with Tho Ha village, where we were welcomed into a local home. I got to try my hand at making the rice paper from spring rolls on a traditional device. The wife can make 1,000 a day. I struggled to make about four. The husband shared rice wine and we sang and played traditional string instruments. Lam, driver and I had a simple, delicious pho lunch. There was still time to visit Dau and But Thap pagoda in Bac Ninh province before returning to Hanoi.Days Four and Five were spent traveling to Halong Bay and sailing the Red Dragon junk overnight in the less crowded Bai Tu Long Bay. Great conversations with van-mates getting there and with my eight shipmates on the boat. The last day was a drive back to the airport. All and all, an extraordinary trip, thanks to Custom Vietnam. Lam was a wealth of information, as he answered hours of questions from me, and I became quite the expert in everything from rice growing to Vietnamese culture.I will definitely use these guys again when I explore other parts of Vietnam."

Out of the four days, three were spent touring with Custom Vietnam Travel Day Tours. We were greeted at the pier, and promptly transported to the various sites without delay. Our guides were very friendly and answered most of our questions regarding their local customs, history etc. We stuck to the schedule, for obvious reasons, but were never really rushed. We were given ample free time for browsing. Majority of the time were spent on historical sites, which was really really nice. Timing of our tours was also excellent, in that we arrived at Hue first thing in the morning with minimal number of tourists, making the visit very pleasant and comfortable. The boat ride from the pagoda on the Perfume River was okay, nothing exciting, but a nice break from the heat. The village walk at Yen Duc was also nice, up close and personal. We were right in the heart of a regular village, complete with dogs, cows, rice paddies, ducks and vendors selling veggies, seafood, brooms etc. It was a nice introduction to the way of life at Yen Duc. The full day Halong Bay boat trip was the highlight of my Vietnam trip. We enjoyed a leisurely cruise along the bay, admiring the limestone cliffs and mists floating around the rock formations. The visit to the cave was most impressive, albeit a challenge for older and mobility challenged visitors. Again, the caves were not crowded, making it a very relaxing and enjoyable visit. Lunch on board was very nice, consisting mostly of seafood, and of course, the traditional Vietnamese spring rolls. Prior to our arrival, our guide, Loi, contacted the boat's chef, and informed them of different lunch preferences, i.e. vegetarians, people allergic to seafood and those who can eat anything. In total, they had three different versions for our group. We were on the \"everything\" table, and the seafood was fresh and nicely prepared. My only gripe was that they did not include drinks with the meal, not even water. Although the cost of coffee is only US$1, it would have been nice if they included that. I can understand if they charged for beer or any type of alcohol, but tea and coffee? Not a big deal, just a nice touch, that's all. We had water on the bus, but the tour guide forgot to hand these out, and so when we were on board the boat, there was no other way but to either buy their bottled water, coffee or tea. After lunch, we were offered the option of kayaking which was quite enjoyable. Again, we were not rushed, but were provided with a guideline of where we should paddle to, and the guide paddled with us all the way. The vans were clean, but a bit cramped. For long journeys of 1.5 to 2 hours one way, it was a bit tight and not the most comfortable ride, but that too was not very important, since the drivers delivered us back to the cruise ship on time, and in one piece."

The tours we went on were Ho Chi Minh City, Hue and Halong Bay. We found the tours, and the guides, to be excellent and they did everything possible to provide history and background to all the tours.At one stage in the planning process, for our 2 day stop at Halong Bay, we had considered doing an afternoon tour on the bay with an evening transfer to Hanoi for an overnight there and full day tour the next day. Fiona very quickly provided this option to us, although we decided instead not to go to Hanoi and spend a full day junk tour on Halong Bay. This was the highlight of the Vietnam tours, and Fiona demonstrated her clear willingness to meet our preferences during the planning phase.Thank you to Fiona, and also to Ilana and Phil for organising the tours on our behalf."

His prices were reasonable compared to what some other private guides were quoting us. Smiley always smiles! He was smiling throughout the trip and was extremely nice to have around. We went to halong bay with Carina cruise and smiley came along with us. It was nice to have him there as he provided us information and brought us out on our own during the excursions from there(cave/kayaking). From there, we went on to Ninh binh where he brought us to the dragon stairs/ riding on the boat as well as cycling. The four of us had such a good time with him that when we were saying goodbye it felt as though we were saying goodbye to a friend! He is extremely approachable and honest. He will do his best to make sure that you don't get scammed during your trip and knows what to do when you faint(true story)!

Over the preceding six months Fiona was patient and helpful at answering innumerable questions from the organisers and those interested in the trips. The company offered competitive prices. We went in small groups on coaches of no more than sixteen.Speaking for the trips I went on. The drivers were excellent. Frankly the driving in Vietnam of moped riders etc was a bit scary. The horn is the most important bit of machinery on any vehicle.The guides were very good although their views on the Vietnam (American) war varied a lot. They were all knowledgeable and helpful. We had some very good meals included in our prices with the one at Hue particularly good. We went to places that the big tour groups visited plus places they did not. In small groups we could all hear and easily ask questions.These tours were great value for money and the company gets top marks from me."

When traveling in Vietnam, there are many tour companies from which to choose, but after much research we opted to go with Custom Vietnam travel.We just returned from a 15 days tour in Vietnam and we had a great time. The tour was wonderful and their service was above our expectations. CVT's attention to detail was incredible. Every part of our trip was flawless and smoothly. We couldn`t ask for anything more than that! Smiley (the owner) and Susan at the CVT put together a custom itinerary for us to see HCMC, Mekong Delta, Hoian, Hanoi, Sapa, Halong Bay and Ninh Bhin. The best way to explore a destination is with the locals who know not just the tourist spots, but also the off the beaten track places that really give you a real life experience - CVT does this. We received outstanding service from the time we landed at HCMC until we were dropped off at Hanoi airport at the end of our tour.In Northern Vietnam Smiley was our guide. Actually he was more than a guide - he became our friend. We really enjoyed his company and he made our trip a remarkable experience. He took us to out of the way places that we never would have seen on our own (per our request). Smiley also has a wealth of knowledge about Vietnamese culture and history.Smiley and Susan gave answers all our questions (and I had many) and arranged an interesting and varied itinerary. Not only were they enthusiastic about sharing this beautiful part of the world with us, but nothing was too much trouble for them. If you are planning a trip to Vietnam a looking for an unforgettable experience CVT is defiantly your best partner."

I had arranged a tour using Custom Vietnam Tours of both the Cu Chi Tunnels and Saigon really filling the short time that we had there. Our tour guide, Tri, was waiting as we debarked. We were escorted to a clean, new van for our journey to the tunnels. Along the way, ( a 1 1/2 hr drive passing many rice paddies) we were given information on the history and current conditions in Vietnam. We made a quick stop at a rubber tree plantation and Tri explained the rubber harvesting process. The tunnels were amazing and a must see. Tri made it so interesting. Even the claustrophobic person in our 12 person group went into the tunnels. I did not understand that this was an outdoor museum of sorts. So very interesting.We had a family style lunch(included) in a beautiful restaurant on a little river after our tunnel tour. Excellent food and a lot to eat.From there, we travelled back to Saigon, to visit the Notre Dame Catherdral, the outside of the Reunification Hall, and the former US embassy. We stopped at the end for tea and treats at a great shop. Tri was a great guide, and before travelling, my contact with Fiona was perfect. She answered all my many questions promptly. I would HIGHLY recommend this tour agency."

Let me tell you that in my 35 Countries visited Vietnam is one of the best, Custom Vietnam Travel was incredibly responsive it endless email questions (thanks to Liliana). They were kind enough to organize a custom trip for me as a solo traveller and keep me away from touristic areas per my request, in Vietnam I recommend this if you are experienced in travel however if you need something beyond grass routes let CVT organize with better hotels etc.in more frequently travelled areas. Some of my hotels were pretty rough around the edges but in the areas I requested travel in the North it soon occurred to me there were no other choices. CVT gets my vote for a return trip, and outstanding service. My driver was Mr Hung who is excellent. Mr Smiley the manager met me upon returning to insure the trip went well. These folks really care!! 5 stars is my vote. Overall your best bet for trip planning beyond the normal packages you might find online. Also great for seeing rural areas beyond the scope of a luxury or travel company based in the US who might steer you away from anything beyond the tourist spots. I ended up leaving Vietnam with many great memories"

Many months ago, it was necessary to make flight arrangements within a very short time frame. Phuong (Fiona) responded to instant messaging with startling speed and insight, working out how to wedge all of the experiences we hoped to have into proposed workable alternative itineraries, thus allowing us the confidence to book air travel. Over several months, we corresponded with many additional ideas and questions, all of which were promptly and patiently answered with great accuracy. (I am a bit stunned to realize this was a series of more than 40 emails!) Fiona was superb in choosing appropriate accommodations both in Vietnam and Cambodia, almost to the level of ESP about what level of comfort and adventure we desired and could reasonably accomplish. Our guide in Siem Reap, Vibol, was like a brother after two days, and his local knowledge allowed us to cover a great deal of ground, so that we saw MUCH more than we would have done on our own. Likewise, our Vietnam guide Thiep (Tim) really knew the territory, was cheery and enthusiastic, and through some kind of magic kept us on schedule while never seeming to hurry at all. Everyone involved gave more of themselves than reasonably we could have expected; the components of our itinerary all exceeded expectations. I am not a gushy reviewer, but I must say that every experience was better than hoped."

The reason for not giving terrible rating is because their owners were very apologetic of what had happened and promised not to use the services of Sinh again. They seemed genuine in their apology so we restrict this review to their guide Sinh."

(You can see I am a frequent traveller so I have worked with many agents and this company is the best!)I am so glad I chose this company from those I received quotes from. They were not the cheapest, nor the most expensive, but did provide me everything I wanted and more. From the beginning, the communications were prompt, professional and perceptive. My train tickets, private transfers and day tours, and general logistics were expertly arranged by Custom Vietnam Travel. All the transfers were on time, safe and comfortable. I met the owner, Smiley, and found him to be personable, honest and very knowledgeable. He kept in touch throughout my trip and competently and efficiently made last minute adjustments, even the day before his wife was due to have a baby! His offer to act as interpreter should I ever need one was very reassuring. He helped me with some shopping and introduced me to the restaurant near my hotel with the tastiest food. I was lucky enough to have him as a guide for one of my day tours and he competently answered all of my many questions and took me to places off the beaten track. I think what distinguishes this company is that they understand the \u201ccustom\u201d part and don\u2019t just give you the stock recommendations. If honesty, efficiency and flexible service are rewarded, this company will do well."

Then we agreed to go along with them, and Smiley, personal guide and also founder of the agency took care of us: he called us a taxi, he informed us what to do and what not to do in Vietnam and we were good to go. We had an itenrary with all the information we needed. They came to our hotel for further information, to give us a personal cellphone with their contact information... Everything was taken care of, if we wanted somthing different, they arranged it. The didn't make promises they couldn't realize. Smiley wanted to become a teacher, instead he became a traveler and based on his own experiences as a guide, he created an agency whos only purpose is to give everyone the trip of a lifetime!"

We have gone to south east Asia many times, but never have experienced anything like our trip with Custom Vietnam Travels. We were fortunate to have \"Smiley\" as our tour guide. He became more of a friend than a travel guide. Smiley brought us into his Vietnamese life - not just showing us sights. We met his family and friends, went to parties with him and his friends. For example, we were invited to a one year old child's party which is a very special celebration. We could have opted to stay in our hotel that night, but instead we chose to go to this party. Well, in Vietnam, they call the 1st birthday of baby \"TH\u00d4I N\u00d4I\". \"Th\u00f4i\" means a stop or leaving. \"N\u00f4i\" means baby cradle. In the literal sense, it's a time for \"Leaving Cradle\" and walk! In figurative sense, this opens a new page in child life when the baby passed her 1st hard year dramatically and be ready to step into a new period. We would not have experienced this from any other tour guide.Hanoi is chaos when it comes to traffic - motor scooters and motor cycles and cars going in every direction. I expressed a desire to ride a motor cycle in Hanoi and do our own tour with Smiley on motor bike. What ever we wanted to do, Smiley made it happen. The next thing I knew, my wife and I were on motor bike touring Hanoi and being part of the chaos. It was incredible.Smiley's attention to detail was incredible. Every part of our trip was flawless. The hotels, the restaurants were impecable. However, the things that we did were so amazing and far and beyond what the average tour guide would have arranged."

Our \"guide\" didn't know anything about the architechture or the sculptures or the history of the places we visited. he was either praying or waiting impatiently for us while incessantly performing obscure martial arts moves. If you like strange experiences then he's your man. If you like to hear very simplistic generalizations about buddhism and all the benefits of meditation then book this tour. If we had hired a martian, he could have told us more about vietnam than our \"guide\". At least he's smiling all the time, guess that's why he got positive reviews. On the way to the temple he told us that vietnamese mentality differs from our western in the way that they are more patient and try solve problems by discussion instead of fighting, for example if people have a traffic accident. Strangely enough, on the way back we witnessed an example of the eastern patience and harmony when we saw people involved in a fight after a traffic accident. Driving by we saw how one of the involved people was kicking another one in the face. When we told our \"guide\" that it would be better to call the police, he just smiled and said the police wouldn't come to such a faraway place anyway and he said it's ok. But in a way it was true, the people around this scene were continuing they daily life in a very harmonious manner... Just book another company."

If you want to experience a beautiful, culturally fascinating, and remote area of Vietnam, I highly recommend taking a tour with Smiley of Custom Vietnam Travel to North Vietnam\u2019s Lao Cai and Ha Giang Provinces, which my wife and I did in April, 2012. Smiley is a wonderful guide with his great sense of humor. He speaks excellent English and has a good grasp of what interests tourists who wish to learn about Vietnamese life, culture and history. Smiley\u2019s wife, Phuong, was also wonderful in making changes to our flights within Vietnam and to Cambodia. Smiley\u2019s jeep driver did a great job cautiously negotiating the curves of the mountain roads. The presence of bordering China is strong throughout this scenic and mountainous region but the H\u2019mong, Tay, Thai, Dao and many other \u201cHill Tribe\u201d ethnic groups who live in this predominantly agrarian area have their own distinctive cultures, dress and homes. Avoiding the best known Hill Tribe town of Sapa, we saw few tourists and during the four day stretch of our trip in Ha Giang Province, we saw a total of four other Westerners. After Smiley showed us around Hanoi and arranged a wonderful junk boat overnight trip around a less tourist filled route in Halong Bay, my wife and I began our journey from Hanoi to Lao Cai, taking the noisy and bumpy nine hour overnight train with Smiley. When we arrived at 6 am, Smiley's driver was waiting with a jeep. After arriving, we glanced across the river to the China, and then traveled to the small mountain town of Can Cau for the colorful Saturday market full of food, tapestries and buffalo. We spent the night in Bac Ha and woke up to that town's famous Sunday market full of a wide array of food and wares. Go to the Bac Ha market early, before the Korean tourist buses arrive,After the market, we took a hike through rice paddies observing the hard working, cone hated woman in the fields. We then a boat trip to a nearly village for lunch (as usual during our time in Vietnam, the food was extremely tasty, fresh and bountiful), where the jeep was waiting for a long drive the Panhou Lodge, located in a jungle area near Hoang Su Phi. The lodge is French owned and seemed to have mostly French tourists staying there. The following morning we left to Ha Giang province, again getting close to the Chinese border. After getting travel permits in the provincial capital of Ha Giang, we drove on mountain road switchbacks to the town of Yen Ming, where we stayed the night is the best hotel in town, which was passable but not particularly clean. Be aware that the beds in Ha Giang hotels have mattresses which are as hard as hardwood floors, a sign that the area has yet to change their accommodations to attract Western tourists. But why should they?From Yen Ming, we traveled to the vibrant town of Dong Van, stopping first at the Saphin to see the H\u2019mong King\u2019s palace. Then, before reaching Dong Van, we came across a small village in the mountains where many children came running up to us, as their mothers were washing clothes in the creek. We had brought pens and clothes to hand out for just this situation, and they were well-received. After spending a few hours in Dong Van we drove to Meo Vac, where we spent the night is a wonderful room in hotel overlooking the main town park, where boys where playing soccer and a competitive women\u2019s volleyball game was taking place. The drive between Dong Van and Meo Vac is has a reputation of being the most stunning scenic drive in the country and we were not disappointed. We loved our hotel in Meo Vac, with it\u2019s clean and spacious room overlooking the town park and market, I woke up the next morning early to take photos of the children walking to school, shopkeepers opening their businesses, and women pushing carts full of wares. After breakfast, we returned to the provincial capital, where we enjoyed walking around the town, eating dinner and coming across a Chinese ballet troupe performing in an amphitheater. The next day we returned to Hanoi. You may wish to skip the Panhou Lodge and going straight to Ha Giang, unless you extend the stay there to two nights. It was too much extra driving for one night. I think an extra night or even two in Meo Vac would also be worthwhile, giving you a chance to relax, get a better feel for this pleasant town and spend a full day trekking in the mountains. Smiley will gladly work with you to accommodate your preferences."

We would also like to wish Steven (our guide in Hoi An and Hue) and his beautiful bride to be good luck and happiness for many, many years.Thanks also must go to the captain and crew (especially our guide, Kim, who was so funny and entertaining and Chef Mr. David for the wonderful food, incredible fruit carvings and, especially, my awesome birthday cake) of the Dragon Pearl 3, who gave me the best birthday of my life on a Junk cruise around the famous and absolutely beautiful Halong Bay, where we enjoyed kayaking, swimming and meeting the locals on the floating fishing villages.Thanks also to your expert drivers who were always on time, polite and helpful, and kept us safe wherever we went.We also want to say thank you to the beautiful people of Vietnam who, no matter where we went, were always friendly and happy, and made us feel at home. And finally Lam, a great big thank you to you! Thank you so much for everything! Your service was amazing from the first contact in January to meeting you in person in Hanoi. I\u2019m sure we will be back to see you again."

Lam organised our tour, and it was just great to be met at each airport and have a private guide with good knowledge of the area at each of our destinations. The trip basically went without a hitch. If I were to do this again though I think I would probably allow more free time - as we were all pretty tired at the end of each day. So be sure to read your proposed itinerary carefully so it suits your individual needs."

We have done quite a few bus tours before, but get a bit sick and tired of having to wait for 30 people as everyone travels at there own pace, so was looking for a private tour to accommodate our group of 4. We booked a 17day Cambodia & Vietnam holiday through Mr Lam. What an excellent choice... With many emails back and forth to get the itinerary just the way we wanted and a phone call from Mr Lam to confirm that is exactly what we wanted to do and to answer any further questions...Highlights for me was having a romantic dinner in a cave (Dragon Pearl 1 junk boat) on Halong Bay. Thank you Mr Lam for recommending the 3 day 2 night cruise at the end of the tour for time to relax before heading home...Highlights for my husband Steve Angkor Wat Temples at Siem Reap.Mr Lam and his team of Tour Guides and Drivers are complete professionals and would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone..."

We traveled with Indochina Pioneer this past summer (July-August 2016) for our honeymoon.It was a 30 day private tour through Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. Kata, our travel agent from Indochina Pioneer, made our trip unforgettable. She was so easy to communicate with while we were initially planning the itinerary, and then was still so easy to communicate with during the trip. If we wanted to change our itinerary for the day, or maybe stay the night in a slightly different location from where our hotel was located, Kata would respond to our emails within an hour and not stop working with us until we were completely happy. As for the daily itineraries, you could tell that Kata had carefully hand-picked every single activity to our liking. We had let her know that we were foodies and she organized numerous cooking classes and market tours, as well as hand-picked fantastic restaurants for us to try in the different countries. Every single day we had a driver and a tour guide pick us up with cold water and frozen towels, and it made the tours so easy and relaxing even though we were out and about all day in the heat. Every tour guide spoke fluent English and was extremely knowledgable about their country. Kata also made sure to tell every single hotel that it was our honeymoon, and we were greeted with roses and balloons and cakes in many of the hotels during our trip. It was fantastic!! Kata and Indochina Pioneer made our honeymoon trip unforgettable and we could not have even imagined such a luxurious, relaxing, yet exciting and interesting month. As a side note, while we were in Hanoi, we got to meet Kata in person, as well as the whole crew at Indochina Pioneer, and they took the time to sit down with us and hear our feedback, and even sang happy birthday to me (as that day was my birthday)!!! :)We have already recommended Indochina Pioneer to all of our family and friends because we firmly believe that there is no better travel agency than Indochina Pioneer. Kata, thank you again for a truly awesome honeymoon!!!"

I don't usually book tours as I prefer to do my own thing but as I was going on a family holiday I decided it might be easier to have someone else organise for us. I was initially apprehensive as the deal seemed too good to be true & I was wary that it could be a scam. I asked lots of questions & I definitely didn't make it an easy process for Lam, but he was very professional at all times & it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made. At every new location we had a new tour guide and personal driver. Our guides spoke terrific English & were more than happy to accommodate us, even when we made some last minute changes to the itinerary. Nothing was ever any problem for them. They took us to some non-touristy areas which was great as we got to see how the locals really live & they showed us the best places to take photos so we have some awesome holiday snaps.My family & I had an amazing holiday & were really impressed with the level of service offered & the care given to us. A big thank you to Lam & his team, this is one holiday we will never forget."

Carefully picked hotels which made our stay wonderful, Friendly guides speaking good English, Clean vehicles with water and wet wipes. A well planned itinerary, we did make a few changes and Ruby was kind enough to make changes and come up with suggestions. It was nice to see Ruby when she came to the hotel in Hanoi and see us.

My dad, mum, sister and I were not disappointed! At every stage of our trip we had a tour guide and a driver in each new city we visited. All of the guides spoke very good English and they all had great knowledge of their city. We would never have got as much out of this trip if we did it by ourselves. Our guides knew all the best spots to get the best photo and recommended us great restaurants to eat out at. They took us shopping to places which they knew had the best quality of product and helped get us good prices! All of our accommodation was chosen for us and we were happy with every place we stayed in. All of our guides had a great sense of humour and were all very concerned when my dad fell ill. We even had calls from the head office to see how he was feeling! Nothing was ever too much trouble for them. We really loved our holiday and know it was that much more enjoyable thanks to the lovely guides and the service they provided. I can not recommend this company enough!"

All of the guides were amazingly knowledgeable about the history and culture of your amazing country. We often hear Vietnam described as a beautiful country over here in NZ. We would say that it is the people who are beautiful. The people seem at peace with themselves even though many appear to have little in the way of material goods and services. I would say that the people we came across had a gentleness and calmness about them. We also felt very safe wherever we went. We would also like more people in our country to know that Cambodia is a safe place to visit. - in Siem Reap at least. Like the rest of the world, we were shocked at what happened there under Pol Pot's regime.Once again thank you so much for giving us a wonderful experience that we will never forget. We have already recommended your company to friends. One couple even sounded sorry that they had already booked on a different type of tour!"

The needs of our family (2 adults, 2 children; 6 and 7years) were given the highest priority with room for flexibility and change during our stay which helped to make this a memorable family holiday. From it from as far South as the Mekong Delta through to Sapa in the north we feel we have seen The Authentic Vietnam.

My contact at Indochina was Ruby and she was excellent. From the first interaction by email she was prompt and answered all my questions...and I had many.I saw an itinerary online they offered and used it as a starting point. We then turned it into my dream vacation for my birthday trip. We started in Saigon, then went to Hoi An, Hue, Ninh Binh, Halong bay cruise and Hanoi. Ruby had awesome suggestions and we were very happy adding Ninh Binh. Which I would have never thought of on my own. I gave her a loose budget, our must sees in each area, what type of rooms we wanted (specialty boutique hotels, 4 star-hotels and cruise) in locations we prefer (in the middle of the action or beach resorts).Since I like to be involved I asked for several hotels and cruises to choose from. Ruby worked her magic and got me great options to choose from and an itinerary that was perfect for us. She then took care of all domestic flights. The tour guides in each region we stayed spoke English and were friendly and knowledgable. Our guides catered to any changes we wanted with daily pick up times, shopping & extra stops. The vans were newer, the drivers were safe & they always had bottled water and/or fresh towelettes waiting after seeing sights or shopping.Our tour guides were Larry in Saigon (super funny & knowledgable), Ben in central Nam (total sweet heart) and Tam in Hanoi (great guy) are all worth a mention. The staff at the La Siesta hotel in Hanoi were excellent too (shout out to Lukas and Tina). They even had balloons upon arrival for my bday. The boutique Hoi An was on a good part of the beach and was a 10 minute ride to town, loved the pool there. All our hotels were very good and had great breakfasts included. Reasonable mini bars, and clean rooms in awesome locations. One even had a killer claw foot tub (Eldora in Hue).The La Fairy cruise in Haling bay was really nice. It's a newer company and only 1 other offers a dinner inside a cave. It only has 10 rooms and two have a small balcony. If you can get a balcony room do it. It is almost all windows so it's amazing to watch the sunrise from bed and have coffee on your balcony. Lunch and dinner was very good however breakfast, not so much. Drink prices are reasonable but more since it's a cruise. I have already told friends about Ruby and Indochina. One of our friends family has already gone and returned and had glowing reviews as well. I would not hesitate recommending them to anyone as they customize your trip. So if you are a budget traveler or a 5 star traveler they can sort you out.If you are on the fence or worried about the company being legit don't hesitate, they are really good and honest company! Everything promised was delivered. Cheers! Angie & Dan Novigrod Miami, USA"

From pick up to drop off we had our own driver and guide at our disposal. Kata organized a trip that included a wide assortment of fun activities (cooking class, bicycle trips, lunch at a nunnery, homestay dinner, etc). Both of our guides Tong (Central) and Duc (North) were excellent. Being able to talk with them on our road trips to Sapa and Hoi An added a lot to our understanding of the country. Duc, in particular, was a great travel companion and took really good care of us. We stayed at great boutique hotels and went on a high end 2 night cruise of Halong Bay. The price was very, very reasonable and significantly less than a similar trip arranged by one of those big name (Why pay more?) international tour operators. Indochina Pioneer is a local company that provides exceptional service and all of your $ stays within Vietnam. We will use them again on our next trip to SE Asia."

I first found Indochina Pioneer when doing a web search online in the early stages of planning our vacation. I had contacted several agencies for quotes on a personalized trip, but Indochina Pioneer stood head and shoulders abover the rest. From my first contact with Kata, we were extremely pleased. She answered all our questions promptly and quickly put together a tour that was just right for us. I had explained to her that my husband was a Vietnam Vet, so she included sites that would be memorable to him. The tour she put together was just the right pace with a good mix of historic and cultural sights as well as some free time for us to relax. She made the planning process so easy and explained everything we would need upon arrival.....visas, etc. We had wonderful English speaking guides at every destination on our itinerary. Each guide was very well educated about the history of the area we were visiting as well as prompt and flexible with our daily schedules. We were provided with a local cell phone upon arrival for contact with our guides during our stay. Kata kept in constant contact with our guides during our trip and she even took the time to come meet with us while we were in Hanoi. In Vietnam, we visited Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hoi An, Hue and Ho Chi Minh City. The cruise of Halong Bay was one of my favorites as was the town of Hoi An..I would do more than one night next time. Our guides Kim, Tony and Lee were awesome and I would ask for each of them again. Siem Reap Cambodia was lovely...but warm this time of year as it was the dry season. Our guide Kia did an awesome job taking us through the Angkor temples and the sunrise temple visit is not one to be missed. Luang Prabang, Laos was another of my favorites. The Mahout Experience at Elephant Village was probably my most memorable day of our vacation. It was a wonderful relaxing day! Kata did an awesome job on our vacation and gave us some lifetime memories. Definitely ask for her when contacting Indochina Pioneer!"

We stayed only at 4-star hotels and visit the best out-of-hotel restaurants, food was excellent, price was very very reasonable and we had no intestinal problems whatsoever (despite common apprehensions). Hanoi, Hoi Ann, Hue, Saigon and Seam Reap were all interesting in their own way, well, difficult to describe.We have traveled through many places in the last 15 years.

We can't say enough good things about Indochina Pioneers and especially, Kata. We researched tour companies and decided on IP after reading positive reviews. Kata was so helpful. We told her where we wanted to go, some sights we wanted to see, and she put together an amazing itinerary for us for our 3 week travel through Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Kata was patient with us as we made adjustments and bombarded her with questions. She even caught up with us in Hanoi to meet us in person. Kata was so professional and represented the company to the highest level possible, in our opinion. IP employed a driver and an English speaking tour guide for our group of 4 each day of our trip. They were all very professional and very knowledgeable about the areas we were touring. We were treated like VIPs throughout our entire vacation. The hotels that they arranged for us were absolutely wonderful. Our guides directed us to the best local restaurants for dinner on our own. Without IP we do not feel that we would have enjoyed our trip half as much. Do bring your camera and good walking shoes. Our days were busy, and we would suggest that if you have a set itinerary that you set aside every 4 days or so as a day of \"do nothing\". We could have used a day off now and then to rest, but it was our choice to fill the itinerary with as much as possible and Kata helped us choose the best to see and do. Highly recommend IP and ask for Kata. By the way, plan on extra time in Hoi An, turned out to be our favorite place."

I thoroughly researched Indochina Pioneer & also messaged a few people through Trip Advisor to ask their advice.I sent an inquiry through their website and surprisingly within 20 minutes, I received a call from Mr Lam to discuss our options.From then on Kata Tran took over planning our trip. What a Super Star! With so many questions, there were many emails and all were answered promptly. Everything was handled to perfection and once we'd arrived in Vietnam, our tour guides & drivers were fantastic! We could change times or the itinerary to suit ourselves, the guides met us at the airports & helped us with check in too. Nothing was too much trouble. Everything Kata had booked was brilliant - a wonderful insight into a beautiful country with fantastic hotels too.When we arrived in Hanoi, we organised with our guide to meet Kata to thank her. We also visited the office to meet all the staff, including the Managing Director, Mr Quyen. This company, staff & guides go above & beyond in customer service. We've not experienced such VIP treatment before and we were blown away!In Hanoi, I needed a GP & the hotel didn't have one, so I emailed Kata to ask for a recommendation. Within 15 mins, our guide Tony rang & he was coming to get me to take me to a clinic in a hospital. All organised efficiently by Kata. Thank goodness too as Tony helped translate for me. At the hospital, I was stunned to see Kata come through the door, just to make sure I was alright. Now that's going above & beyond doing their jobs. It was after hours and neither were bothered by it.We also passed comment about a noisy hotel room & the pool not being available due to renovations (we'd specifically requested this hotel because it had a pool).Upon our return to the hotel, the Customer Service person approached us to discuss & try to resolve any issues. Once again Kata showed her amazing talent in her job by trying to help us again. We want to thank Kata for everything she did for us from the planning & going above and beyond to make our trip fantastic! She is exceptional at her job and we can't recommend Indochina Pioneer highly enough. Our next trip will be Cambodia, with a quick visit to Vietnam just to visit Kata. We will definitely be booking through Indochina Pioneer again.Thank you Kata, you are AWESOME! :)"

We could not find a tour to include all we wanted to see and do, so after reading the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor about Indochina Pioneer we made contact with Mr Lam. Mr Lam customised our tour and provided advice on how long to stay at various places, the best time to travel etc. I have to admit to being a little tentative, thinking it may be a scam but my fears were alleviated from the moment we met our first guide at Siem Reap airport. The guides and drivers were always on time to pick us up. The guides generally spoke good English (some better than others) and all were flexible with regard to slightly changing our itinerary on a particular day if we requested it. We chose to stay mostly in small boutique hotels and this worked well for us as they are usually close to restaurants and markets. With a customised tour such as this you can choose the type of accommodation (2,3,4 or 5 star)We would recommend Mr Lam and Indochina Pioneer to travellers who want to choose their own route and travel either on their own or with a small group of friends. In our opinion it represented good value for money."

The tour consisted of myself, my husband and twin sons which was perfect. The tour guides were knowledgeable and helpful, as were the drivers.Mr Lam suggested we get a speed boat from Chau Doc, Vietnam to Phnom Penh up the Mekong River which was a great way to travel. The crocodile farm on the way was well worth the lunch stop.I would recommend Indochina Pioneer as a great tour company for families. My in-laws are travelling with them later in the year.

Our visit to Halong Bay was unfortunately very cold, but was still made enjoyable, and guests still participated in canoeing and visiting the floating fishing village. Although there were many highlights with the sounds, smells and overall busy day to day life especially in the markets, my favourite highlight was in Ho Chi Minh City with a park becoming one enormous flower market and the boats on the river covered in flowers ready to sell, all for the Tet festival.

Hotels appreciated Indochina Pioneer business.- Halong Bay cruise was one of the highlights - small, comfortable boat with great food and most incredible landscapes. How did they get such a good chef for a 10 cabin boat? - Lam suggested many off the beaten track attractions that helped us to understand and appreciate the country.- Our tour guides in every place were knowledgeable about history and architecture, forthcoming with cultural and lifestyle information- They were very flexible both in planning, and trip changes when the weather did not cooperate. For example - we don't ride bicycles, so we ended up doing one day tour on the back of 2 scooters. Fun!!!- Street food tour with Luu in Hanoi was fun, delicious and educational. We kept eating on the street throughout the trip. No food poisoning, just delicious food.- Private cars were medium size SUVs immaculately maintained and drivers were safe.I infrequently gush - see my other reviews. But this was one of our best trips, and the private tour ended up costing less than a comparable group tour booked from US."

The frame size for my partner's bike was much too large for her and it was fitted with a male shaped saddle which caused her considerable discomfort on the first day. The saddle was changed on Day 2 after she refused to continue the holiday with that particular bike at the end of day 1. The guide did not appear to be completely clear of the route at times and we needed to complete an 'about turn' 3 times during the trek which may be why our route didn't appear to be as described in the brochure. Indo China guides are very knowledgeable and helpful and know many local secret gems to visit but their spoken english can be difficult to follow at times even for me as a native English speaker. Indo China Pioneer specialise in providing tailor made tours for small groups down to 2 in number and flexibility in preparing a holiday programe to suit individual customers requests including the selection of the most suitable hotel using their wealth of local knowledge. Moderately priced boutique hotels are typically chosen."

She organised a 12 day trip to Myanmar in January 2016 with a few days each in Yangon, Bagan, Mandalay and Inle. Great guides and drivers. Lovely hotels. Terrific boat trip from Mandalay to Bagan. Day trip to old colonial Maymyo. Highly recommended. Kata always listens carefully to what you want and is very flexible."

I liked Lam's suggestions at Indochina Pioneer. I told him what we wanted (my son, daughter-in-law, daughter, and myself) and he organized everything with my particular requests in mind. Four of us traveled for 1 month throughout all of Vietnam and Cambodia, with private guides and drivers, staying at boutique hotels and seeing all of the sights worth seeing. Out of 10 hotels, we had only one that was unacceptable, and the guide brought us to another, acceptable hotel right away. The whole trip really went like clock-work. We received great service and I will not hesitate to use Lam and Indochina Pioneer in the future."

We did not have too much time to plan out and the dates of group tours did not fit in with our schedules when we came across Indochina Pioneer's website. We contacted them, gave our schedule and budget and Kata Tran promptly sent us a detailed itinerary with cost. We really appreciated that there was a lot of flexibility in both budget as well as the itinerary and that we got a custom, personalized tour package which suited our needs and schedules perfectly. We had to change our dates and itinerary couple of times and Kata always sent us revisions promptly. Our 11 day trip started from Hanoi in North Vietnam and covered, Hanoi and Halong Bay in North VIetnam, to Central Vietnam covering Hoi Ann, Hue, DMZ, Phong Nha and Ke Bang National Park and surrounding attractions. And From there we went to South Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh City and surrounding attractions including Cu Chi Tunnels and Mekong Delta. Kata had given us detailed itinerary, what to expect weather-wise, and what sites will be covered. Her itinerary covered all of the important sites and UNESCO Heritage sites and made excellent use of our 11 days in Vietnam. The hotels and a Homestay chosen were all excellent and we were very pleased with the accommodations. The whole trip was executed like clockwork. During the 1 days we had three different cars with different drivers and English-speaking guides and all of them were excellent. We left with such good memories of Vietnam, the beautiful sites, the rich history, very friendly people, and delicious food."

We decided to request Indochina Pioneer to plan our travel since we looked up reviews that said getting around in Vietnam is not as easy as in other parts of the world, given the lack of fluent English speakers in the service industry and they were right! The two or three instances when we had to take cabs on our own, or order food, it never was what we expected and a few times, we were in for an unpleasant surprise.Having said that, go with Indochina, they are simply fabulous! Why did we decide to go with them instead of all the others? Well, we found them to be the most efficient, cost effective and service oriented. We were coordinating with Ruby for a few months before our travel and she was so efficient and professional, it was almost hard to believe! Her responses to emails were at lightening speed, and her attention to detail really gave us a sense of comfort. She customised the tour to Hanoi, Ninh Binh and Halong Bay according to our interests and food preferences and left absolutely nothing to chance.We were travelling with infants, elderly parents and couples, so we really needed every comfort in a foreign country as possible and Ruby ensured that, even while we were on the tour , checking on us everyday to make sure we were well taken care of.One suggestion is to ask the company to assure you a tour guide who will volunteer information on the history, food, places you are passing and living in, else you may get one who just accompanies you around."

We worked with Kata on our travel planning arrangements and Mr. Quyen was our guide. From the very beginning, this company put us at ease as Kata was extremely attentive to the details of our trip and responsive over email. When requesting multiple revisions to the itinerary, she was always careful to attend to all of the changes making the communications with her very efficient. She was flexible and allowed us to customize the itinerary in any way we desired. However, this company really set itself apart from others I have used once we arrived on the ground to Vietnam. Our driver was ready and waiting at the airport. Upon arrival (very late at night - after midnight i believe), our driver hands me his cell phone and I was welcomed to Vietnam by our guide. He immediately put any fears to rest about our tour for the next day. Also, his perfect English was evident through this communication. We really appreciated not only the very comfortable vehicle (which stayed with us for the remainder of our trip) but also the careful driving of our driver. He was always cautious on the road and we felt very safe throughout our journey with the company. The next morning we were picked up by the same driver and our guide for the trip (Mr. Quyen) and taken on a tour of Hanoi. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the city and culture. He went out of his way to share information with us and was extremely attentive for the entire day. The itinerary followed precisely what we had requested. We really enjoyed spending time with the guide and the experience he offered us in getting to know the city of Hanoi. During lunch, our travel planner, Kata, made a surprise visit to greet us and ensure that we were enjoying our tour. We really appreciated that she made the special effort to come and meet us. The next day the same guide and driver greeted us in the morning and we were off to visit Bai Tu Long bay (near Halong Bay). We really appreciated Kata's advice on the selection of the boat as we ended up with a private boat on Indochina Junk (Indochina Princess) which was both clean and beautiful. It was a long drive out to the harbor, but the very comfortable car, safe driver and excellent guide made it a pleasure. The boat ride was extremely relaxing and the scenery pristine. We also really enjoyed the food. The guide offered the perfect balance of spending time with us to provide context and information, while also giving us some private time to relax and enjoy our time on the boat. The next day we were met promptly again by the driver and returned to the airport. From start to finish..everything was so carefully executed.After dealing with many, many travel companies around the world, I can say without hesitation that this company is truly in a class of its own. Careful planning, outstanding tours, warm and wonderful staff. My only regret was not booking my our onward travels with this company. I fully intend to use them for our future travels in Southeast Asia. It was a pleasure having this company plan our travels! Highly, highly recommend. Thanks to your staff for a very special experience in Vietnam. We will forever remember your kind hospitality."

What we liked about her itinerary was that it did not just cover the main tourist sites but also included \u201cunique experiences\u201d such as bike riding in the Mekong Delta, lunch at nunnery in Hue, street food tour in Hanoi. We were very pleased with how well organised the tours were. All guides were punctual, knowledgeable and helpful. The drivers were all safe in their driving. We have no doubt that the knowledge of the guides about the sites we visited as well as the general information provided by them about the Vietnamese culture and people, enhanced our enjoyment of the trip. We were also very happy with the restaurant/meal choices which were not only a tasty meal but also often an education of the food of the region. Kata was easy to work with, updating details of our itinerary as required and answering my many questions. We thank Kata and the Indochina Pioneer team for a fabulous touring experience in Vietnam."

Nevertheless, we were really appreciative for the surprises. All stays throughout the trip were well picked and recommended by Mr Lam, no signs of dirty bedsheets/insects. Bathrooms were clean and spacious too.In summary, the places we had visited were absolutely breathtaking with stunning views, what more could we ask for with all the good food and great company!\u00a0Highly recommended to groups and families as Indochina Pioneer is flexible and have the ability to handle group requests!

I can't speak highly enough of this company - it was truly one of the best trips we have taken (Turkey and Africa - with other tour companies - being the other two). Four of us went on a 3-week private tour of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos all arranged by Kata, the representative who helped us. We had an excellent experience, including the sights, the guides (Rom in Siem Reap and Thuy in Saigon were fantastic), the hotels, and the restaurants (yep, that's the whole shebang!). We loved every other hotel and every meal with two exceptions. The Chateau Restaurant = Restaurant Chateau in Saigon wasn't good and the Moonlight hotel was nice but El Dorado in Hue might have been better - although others seem to love Moonlight). Kata answered a kajillion questions prior to the trip with patience and reassurance. The itinerary was very flexible; we could add and eliminate activities as we pleased - even when we were there. You won't realize certain things until you're there, so you may want this kind of flexibility. A couple of the guides suggested a few additional activities that were fantastic. A couple of side notes: Vietnam Airlines is the best of the worst, so if you're flying within the country or to Laos or Cambodia, be prepared for changed flight times. The planes themselves were fine. If you start playing with the itinerary, keep hotel check-out vs. flight/drive times in mind (unless you don't mind sitting around for a while with nothing to do). And do a street food tour with one of the guides - or two! Our street food tour with guide Duan in Hanoi was wonderful."

Lam, the proprietor, definitely did not disappoint! He worked with us to customize an itinerary for Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hoi An, Hue, and My Son, providing us with a well-organized PDF booklet of all our planned excursions. In addition, his pricing is very competitive - far less than the cost of similar tour companies based here in the U.S. The planning couldn't have been easier, and we felt very well taken care of throughout our one-week (too short) stay in north and central Vietnam. Friendly tour guides awaited us at the airports in Hanoi and Hoi An to take us to our hotels. Sure, many hotels offer this service for a fee, but it was nice to have it all arranged at once, rather than coordinating with multiple providers. WHEN (not if!) we come back to Vietnam, we will definitely work with Indochina Pioneer again. I only wish we had found them sooner! We would have been able to get better rates on our hotel stays than what we were able found on our own.

Kata rerouted us 9 times to satisfy our wishes and was very quick at answering questions and trying to find our best options. We had a few problems such as a delay in the arrival of 2 of the travelers & Kata made sure they would join the others very quickly, having to make new reservations on the spot. One traveler got sick and again Kata with the help of our guide Tin Tin in Saigon arranged to have someone stay at the hotel overnight while the others were on the Mekong river. Finally Kata helped us again to rebook a flight from Vietnam to Myanmar having missed our departing flight. We were amazed by the competency of Kata and Indochina Pioneer agency, their kindness and ease to work with. Way to go Kata.We had such an incredible trip, enjoyed every part of it. Our guides were very competent, friendly, knowledgeable and shared a lot of their experiences with us making it more personal.I would recommend this agency anytime"

We didn't just \"see\" the sights, we had a deep cultural exchange and experience. Most telling is the service provided when there was a problem. When we had a problem with one of our internal flights, they sent 4 people to the airport to help us! And 2 people at the next airport for our connecting flight! When I had \"traveler's tummy\" the guide found a lovely young woman from Vietnam who was so kind and nursed me back to health with the local Vietnamese remedies. I am so grateful for the wonderful trip and will savor the memories for many years to come! Thank you Kata, staff and all of our great guides!"

On our arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly and smiling face, our Guide, Mr. Lam ( Duong Dai) from Indochina Pioneer. Because of our short stay, Mr. Lam did not waste time but gave us a brief history of the city, how the rivers run in Vietnam, the formation of lakes in Hanoi and its tube buildings. With his briefing, we found it helpful when he showed us around Hanoi and its out skirt in the following days. Our one and a half day tour was very well planned and had catered to our needs. He gave us short but precise explanations on all scenic spots. No long story which might make us feel bored like in some tours. We loved the food in the restaurants he had planned for us. The hotel, Sofitel Legend Metropole which was highly recommended by Mr. Lam is excellent. If we go to Hanoi in the future, Indochina Pioneer (Day tours) would be our first choice to choose for tour planning."

Even though we found along the way sometimes flights were delayed someone was on the phone reorganizing things so we did not miss a beat on our trip .We were very happy with accommodation & meals which were included. Travelling from Cambodia, Ho Chi Minh City, Hoi An, Hue, Hanoi & Ha Long Bay, naturally we met a few guides & drivers along the way. All were very informative & went out of their way to help us & travelling in very comfortable cars gave us more opportunities to enjoy such amazing people's company.The knowledge we gained from our guides & the laughs along the way, we are so glad we chose to take our private tours through Indochina Pioneer & highly recommend if you are looking into a trip in these regions say hello to Lam, we know he will personally make your journey a memorable experience where people go out of their way to make everything right for you.We would like to take this opportunity to thank Lam & his team for helping make a dream of ours come true & for giving such a courteous personal touch ....."

We have never booked a holiday through a tour company before & were initially uneasy about booking through a foreign company. However right from the first contact with Indochina Pioneer, we felt total confidence.Lam phoned me within 10 minutes of my initial email in which I had explained a little about our interests & which areas we\u2019d like to visit. We received emails & phone calls regularly during the planning process. The final booking was made after we had the opportunity to review not only the itinerary but also the accommodation. Lam\u2019s organizational skills & follow up are exemplary. We chose to stay in 3 star accommodation & some homestays most of which exceeded our expectations. The hotels were well located, clean, comfortable, had wi-fi & offered a wide range of breakfasts. A welcome dinner with a local family was organized for our first night. This warm & friendly hospitality set the tone for the rest of the holiday.We had 3 sets of drivers & guides, one for each region; they were all absolutely wonderful. They are what MAKE the trip. We spent 20 days with Huynh ( driver) & Huan ( guide) in the north. They became like part of the family; we all got on so very well. The cars were driven very safely, were air-conditioned & comfortable. The drivers kept their cars tidy & always had bottles of water for us each morning. While the drivers didn\u2019t speak English, we were still able to have a laugh with them. The guides\u2019 English was easy to understand. They shared their vast knowledge of the history & culture in a way that was interesting & easy to absorb. They understood our interests & went out of their way to help us experience those extra little things that make the trip more personal & special. Thank-you Huan ( in north), Vu ( in centre) & Tam ( in south)! You all put in 110%.One highlight for us was our time in the north; especially the rural north where we tried to get away from the general tourist path. We felt privileged to meet families from several different ethnic groups, spend some time in their homes, share stories & sometimes join in with farming activities. To fit in with our love of the outdoors & nature, many days included walks or bike riding. On many of the days lunches & sometimes dinner were included. It meant that a vast array of dishes were served to us that we possibly would not have otherwise tried. Our only regret is that we didn\u2019t have more time to dedicate to the central & southern part of Vietnam.We would thoroughly recommend Indochina Pioneer, they are professional & thorough but still give a very personal touch."

Mr Lam was in communication with regularly in the months before our trip with lots of advice and what to see and where to stay. he was always patient and helpful. I doubt we would have found some of the amazing places and hotels without him. we chose the 3 star level of hotel and were amazed at some of the great places we stayed - highlights were La Siesta in Hanoi and Tam Coc Garden in Ninh Binh. Another feature of Indochina pioneer was the in country support. We stuck some minor issues with flights and Lam was always contactable to sort stuff out.Our trip included a lot of meals and almost without exception the quality of the restaurants and food was great!We met Lam for lunch in Hanoi and he was keen to receive feedback and is committed to continuous improvement of his service.another highlight was staying and a beachfront resort (Hoi An Boutique) in Hoi An which enables us to relax by the pool in the morning and then travel a few Ks to experience the world heritage delights of Hoi An.One of our learnings was we probably pack in to much and did not allow enough down time but again there was nothing I would want to leave out.I am happy to recommend Indochina Pioneer if you want a tailor made tour of Indochina. Lam is a wonderful organiser."

After much research we decided to use IndoChina Pioneer to help us achieve the best possible trip within our time frame. From the guides and drivers to the constant contact from Lam at IndoChina we were kept in the loop throughout the entire 3 weeks. Our journey took us up the Mekong River, to Anchor Wat temples and lunch at the local Nunnery and the list goes on. Very full itinerary (which was our choice), the only thing I would say is to make sure you have plenty of lay days in between. My favourite was Hoi An were we shopped and had shoes and clothes made but also enjoyed a private cooking class with Hanh from Gioan Cooking School. The hotels that were recommended to us did not disappoint, the landmarks were breath taking and the people truly lovely. We altered a couple of items on our itinerary as we were going and everything was handled for us without any dramas. If you are thinking of holidaying in Vietnam, I cannot recommend this company highly enough. We will be back and we will be using IndoChina Pioneer. Thanks Lam and team for a wonderful experience.

We were going on a caving expedition in Vietnam with a local British owned company and we wanted a recommendation for a tour company and they put us onto Indochina. After many daisy research we decided to go with them. I can honestly say they were outstanding. The tour operator contact Kata Tran was amazingly helpful. Always replied quickly and offered us a great holiday and very reasonably priced. We had a 9 day tour from Hanoi a drive to Halong Bay back to Hanoi flight to Hoi An then a train to Danang onto Hue and dropped us off in Phong Pha. From transport, drivers, guides and hotels the trip went smoothly. The guides were great, transport always on time and the hotels were 3 star and were just what we wanted and always located in great positions for exploring the area. We had a late entry to our itinerary for a one night stay in Hanoi and she placed us in an amazing hotel (Apricot Luxury Hotel) This was our only 5 star hotel but for one night after staying in a cave for 5 days it was a perfect end to a perfect holiday. Thank you Kata for a amazing experience."

Kata listened to our preferences, understood our interests, accommodated our quirks and added amenities and bonuses that we could not have imagined. Our trip took us to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. We wanted to include a river cruise of the Mekong Delta, a beach vacation somewhere in the middle, local culture, history, etc. We met with families, walked the river paths, lounged on a stunning beach, rode elephants and petted tigers, planted rice, toured tribal villages, visited museums, war fields, markets, temples and palaces, and enjoyed scenery that left us in quiet wonder. We were thrilled with a private sampan cruise of the Mekong with a crew of three and a private guide for three nights and four days. Kata Tran put it all together for us with guides and drivers that accommodated every whim we had. Her responses were immediate, her suggestions right on target. Planning the trip with Kata was fun.

It was our first trip to Vietnam, and we relied on Lam's first-hand knowledge and expertise to guide us in planning our itinerary. We travelled from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, visiting the Mekong delta (overnight cruise), Dalat, Hoi An, Hue, Sapa, Halong Bay (overnight cruise) and Ninh Binh. Lam was extremely friendly and helpful, responding promptly to all my emails, making changes and additional suggestions as requested, and carrying out my wishes with regard to accommodation, etc. The trip went off seamlessly as planned. We were met at each destination by a guide and a private car with a driver. The guides were reliable, knowledgeable, helpful and friendly and spoke good English. They were also flexible with the itinerary if the need arose. The drivers were punctual and courteous, and their expert local driving skills meant that we always felt safe, even in the most challenging traffic conditions.We were happy with all our hotels. They were clean, comfortable, included good breakfasts, and were well situated close to the main tourism areas, enabling us to walk to restaurants and places of interest during periods of free time. We only had occasion to complain once during our trip, when we were unhappy with the hotel room we had been allocated. As soon as Lam was told, he immediately contacted the hotel and we were moved to a more suitable room. I would unhesitatingly recommend Indochina Pioneer if you are considering a private tour in Vietnam or other neighbouring countries."

We usually prefer to do things ourselves, but after doing our research and talking to friends who had been, we decided to look into a tour company. We found Indochina Pioneer (and Mr. Lam) through TripAdvisor and we are so happy we did. We were there for 12 days and went from the top of the country to the bottom. Indochina Pioneer made sure everything went smoothly and were very flexible in the cases where we wanted to switch things up along the way. Mr. Lam was always available to quickly help with any questions or changes we had (but it was so well planned, we didn't have to reach out much!).Over the course of our trip, we had 4 different guides/drivers. Really, these were the stars of our trip. We spent a lot of time in the car, and it was such a pleasure to be able spend time with the guides and getting to know about them and Vietnam while driving through the country.Logistically, everything was well thought out - we had busy days, but still plenty of time to relax and unwind. The cars (SUVs actually) were great, with fresh waters always awaiting us. You are never on a group tour - just you and your guide/driver, which was important to us.We hope we are lucky enough to go back to Vietnam, and if we do, we'll definitely be signing up with Indochina Pioneer again."

We debated organizing everything on our own, but decided to go through them instead. We so glad we did! Mr. Lam had everything so well organized! We were never in any large groups, in fact, most of the time it was just us plus a guide so it felt like a very private experience. We were so glad we weren't part of a large tour group being herded from one place to the next. All of the guides and drivers were prompt, courteous, and very friendly. We even recommended that our friends, the Potters, travel through Indochina. They ended up having a very nice time and were just as impressed with the guides as we were. We cannot wait to book our next tour through Indochina Pioneer!"

Less than two weeks before heading to China for work, I decided to see if perhaps I could squeeze in a fun solo trip to neighboring countries while on that side of the world. I usually like to visit at my own pace but since I knew I would be short on time, I decided to give Indochina Pioneer a shot. After all, they did seem to have great reviews. The professionalism and speed by which all my questions were answered only solidified my decision to go ahead and book everything in advance with the help of Mr. Lam (who must be working around the clock considering the speed at which I would get replies; and that, regardless of the time at which I emailed him).Within 10 days, Mr. Lam had organized an awesome itinerary for me to visit both Vietnam and Cambodia. It was a very well organized and extremely detailed day by day itinerary. Included was: information on visa/forms, flights, hotels, meals, guide name and phone number, a brief summary of the day's itinerary along with some relevant history, currency exchange rate, gratuity customs, do's and don'ts, etc.Needless to stay I was more than ready when the time came for me to go. For every region I visited, I was greeted by wonderful tour guides who beside speaking remarkably well english and being knowledgeable about the region, were just so delightful to be with. They made me feel comfortable right away. It was almost like if I was traveling with an old buddy of mine. They were all ready to accommodate me and go beyond the scoop of the planned itinerary if I wanted to. They even did extra research at night if they didn't have the answer to one of my questions and would come back with an answer the very next morning (some even made drawings to help explain certain important points). The drivers were also very friendly, polite, helpful and punctual. Again, they opened doors for me, offered me waters and even asked me if I needed to make stops along the way. They all had nice air conditioned cars/jeeps which given the temperature in some regions, was a definite plus!Aside from having great tour guides and drivers, Mr. Lam also arranged for me to stay in beautiful accommodations with very friendly staff and nice restaurants. All in and all, I had a fantastic time and cannot wait to travel through Indochina Pioneers again! They really made me feel like a princess from beginning to the end!Thanks a million for the best trip ever!!! ;-)"

We had great flexibility in coordinating any late changes to suit. The tour guides were fantastic, punctual, friendly and had a great sense of humour. We had a nice balance of scheduled tours as well as free, down time for relaxation. Four star hotels were a great standard and not expensive. Our personalized tour took us to some smaller, off the track, places that immersed us in the \"soul\" of Vietnam. My personal highlight was the cooking class in Hoi An from the market to table at Gioan Cookery. I highly recommend Indochina Pioneer and in particular, Mr Lam, for anyone considering visiting Vietnam or the bordering countries. They are based in Vietnam, they know Vietnam and their cost is reflective. Thanks once again... :)"

It was lovely to meet her when we were in Hanoi and we have formed a lasting friendship with her and our other guides.Before our trip, I have to admit to being anxious about the authenticity of Indochina Pioneer and the reviews I read. I'm happy to say that all my worries proved to be wrong and we had our best ever holiday with a fantastic itinerary, well organised pick ups, accommodations and outings.I have already been recommending them to friends and family and we can't believe how affordable it was to receive such individual attention and care that we received on our trip. We chose budget/ boutique accommodation and found it not only more than satisfactory but also a more authentic experience of the places we visited. We learned so much more about the lives and cultures of where we visited by interacting with our guides, drivers and the wonderful staff of these smaller hotels.i cannot speak highly enough of everything to do with our trip. It was just a fantastic introduction for us to Asia and I am really looking forward to using Indochina Pioneer again to plan another trip and see places we missed on our first visit.

I was interested in engaging a local tour provider in Vietnam rather than in Australia because I figured they would have all the local knowledge. The booking process was very simple through their website - tell them what you want to see, what your interests are, what your budget range is where and when you arrive and depart - and they tailor a plan for your consideration. They encourage you to check out their recommendations by checking others experiences through tripadvisor and then revert to them with any changes. A couple of iterations of this and its all done. Lam Duong was our consultant and he emailed and phoned us in the lead up to the tour. We met with him for lunch in Hanoi and he made contact at the end of our tour to make sure everything went well. He was available 24/7 during our tour and they provide a mobile phone with sim card during your tour to make access easier. We had to contact Lam only once during the tour as my wife left her handbag on board an internal flight and we did not realize until after the plane had turned around and gone back. Lam very promptly dealt with this through his agent and the handbag was returned the next day - completely intact with credit cards and cash. This is a significant benefit of dealing with a local agent - they take away those anxious moments.  All in all, this was an excellent trip. The accommodation was of a very good standard - well beyond what we expected in our budget, the arrangements and tour guides worked perfectly and there were no nasty surprises. I certainly recommend IndoChina Pioneer without hesitation. Its a great way to see Vietnam from a Vietnamese perspective."

We were all eager to travel to Vietnam but with some hesitation since it still is an unknown. None of us spoke the language and we were unfamiliar with the customs. One of our concerns was traveling thru the country smoothly without wasting valuable time and energy. I contacted Indochina Pioneer about a year before our trip and briefly told them what we hoped to do and see. Lam, our travel agent helped us to plan a 14 day trip thru Vietnam. We visited HCMC, Mekong Delta, DANANG, Hoi An, Hue, Hanoi, Sapa, Halong Bay. It was an amazing trip. We went thru several trip itineraries before we came up with one that fit our needs. Thru this Lam was wonderful with all of our requests and changes. Our travel thru the country was smooth and easy. We were given city/area guides who picked us up from airports or train stations and we traveled in a private van when possible. Indochina Pioneer also booked reservations for our hotels, internal air flights, overnight train trips to Sapa, along with a 2 night cruise on Halong Bay. The hotels that we stayed at were all 4/5*- we were very pleased. Our trip also included many side trips such as Cu Chi Tunnels, Excursion to Mekong Delta, HCMC tour, tour of Hue, Hanoi, Sapa Villages, Halong Bay. The trip included a good mix of history and culture, and our city guides were wonderful. Our travel thru the country was easy and enjoyable. Sapa was one of our favorite areas and well worth the energy to get there. Halong Bay was lovely but the weather was unfavorable when we were there. Wished we had more time in Hoi An. Beautiful beaches in Danang, loved the old city of Hanoi. We all have lovely memories of our trip and always felt very safe where ever we went. Everyone was hospitable and charming - had the pleasure of meeting Lam while we were in Hanoi. Would definitely recommend Indochina Pioneer. Lam was helpful and easy to work with. "

This year in February we booked a guided tour with Indochina Pioneer again to see Laos (last year we were in Vietnam & Cambodia). As suggested by Kata (again my great contact at Indochina Pioneer's) we decided to do a 11 days \"Highlights of Laos\" tour. I didn't have much time for the planning so Kata organized our program. And again we were highly satisfied by it. We visited: Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Pakse and Xieng Khuang. Our program was great and we saw all major sights - I only wish we'd had a little more time to explore Laos even a little longer, but 11 days was great for a beginning. All the days we had a private guide and driver so we could stop whenever we wanted and even make a few changes in the program (about when to be picked up, what to see first, ...) All our tour guides did an excellent job - some even offered a little more than on our program because of their personal life (eg one showed us his temple as he had been a monch there for 9 years and he also took as to the alms giving in Luang Prabang to a place where you don't find 1000s of tourists) so we got a great impression about what life is like in Laos (and it's different from VIetnam and Cambodia) We also never had to wait for our tour guides usually they were even 10 minutes to early! ;) It's just a big difference if you try to explore a country by yourself or if you have local tour guides who can answer all the 100 questions you have! Also all the hotels Kata chose were good just be sure to bring some mosquito spray as there are billions of mosquitos around everywhere!I can only repeat myself again by saying that doing a tour with Inodchina Pioneer is one of the best choices you can make when visiting South East Asia!! The job everybody does there (from tour guides, drivers and of course Kata) is more than great and you can totally trust them and the companys they work with! I can only highly recommend them and me and my family we would definitly book a tour again for the third time! So thank you all very much for our great two vacations that will stay in our mind for a very long time!"

How lucky I was! Kata responded immediately to all e-mails and took into consideration all the things I had planned to visit and fitted them into a well-organised trip. I was apprehensive having never been to the Far East before let alone using a travel agent from a country I did not know. I needn't have worried. Our good friends came with us as we travelled from Laos to Vietnam, took in all the places we wanted and then on to Angkor Wat. Kata organised it perfectly. We had 25 days of varied activities from an Elephant sanctuary in Laos, then to Vietnam where we went hiking in Sapa, in the mountains, on to a 5* junk for Halong Bay, down through Vietnam to lovely Hoi An and Ho Chi Minh and then to the jewel which is Angkor Wat. We crawled through both Vinh Moc tunnels(which we thought were the best), Cu Chi tunnels, learnt loads about the war and each countries customs, history, fears and aspirations, it was truly an amazing trip.Every hotel was at least 4*, we could not fault the choice of any of them. The drivers were all very safe, and supplied water and fresh towels each time we entered the van. The guides were brilliant, their English was good and their knowledge superb. The highlight for all four of us was in fact a trip on the Mekong Delta, with a night on a sampan. We just loved it. We were looked after superbly, taken off the boat to a market and cycled round the town, the bikes being carried on the sampan. It was first class travel and such a lovely way to spend a day and a half, floating down the Mekong tributaries watching life go by....we did not want it to end. Also being an private tour you can adjust your timetable so if you decided you did not want to do something you just opted out or did something else. I cannot praise Kata enough. She was very attentive and came to see us at Hanoi, which was lovely. I can only highly recommend this company with no hesitation.

As a veteran solo traveler - what a treat to have someone take care of me and my husband. Biggest decision was where to eat! Hotels were great. The guides were all knowledgable - we became friends with each of them by the end of each city. I recommend Indochina Pioneer highly and we are starting to plan our next trip with them."

            "review": "Vietnam: North to South (If I could rate Indochina Pioneer higher I would). This was a once in a lifetime trip with my boyfriend and my Mum. I wanted everything to be perfect and with the help of Lam we had nothing to worry about. My Mum was travelling from the UK and my boyfriend and I from Australia. Lam helped to arrange transportation from the airport for the three of us, with our guide Huan meeting us at our different arrival times.We started off in Hanoi where Huan did a fantastic job of guiding us around. It was then time to head up to Sapa. The overnight train was the only part of the trip that was not the greatest - it was cold and there were no extra blankets, and a little daunting as wasn't quite sure where we were getting off. Thankfully on this trip, we got off at the end of the line. They are doing work on the tracks so the train was later in than expected, but we were met by the most wonderful guide, Maya. Maya made our trip to Sapa simply unforgettable. She had an incredibly warm personality and very quickly became a part of our family. We even met her Mother, Grandmother and Sister-in-law. She gave us a real opportunity to find out what it is like to live in Sapa - no question was ever too much. We had a trek into the villages whilst in Sapa - we weren't expecting it be 12km, across rivers - but we look back now and treasure that time with Maya and her family.We returned to Hanoi on the overnight train and jumped on the mini-bus to Halong Bay. (Each time we ended our train journey, there was a hotel arranged for us to have breakfast and a shower - they really had thought of everything). Halong Bay wasn't quite what we were expecting. Huan made sure we got onto the correct boat (there were plenty) and we could start relaxing on the calm waters. The attractions we visited were what everybody else was doing so you did feel a little bit herded but it is a minor detail. The food and staff on our boat were great.After Halong Bay it was back to Hanoi to catch the overnight train to Dong Hoi. This was a little nerve-racking as we were getting off mid-train journey - most people were going on to Hoi An. We awoke to ensure we got off at the right stop but once again there were works on the train line so it was delayed. We arrived in Dong Hoi and were very pleased to see our guide, Vu. Vu was a fountain of knowledge. We spent 6 days with him touring the caves at Dong Hoi, driving to Hue, Danang and then onto Hoi An. Hoi An is simply beautiful - not surprising that it is a 'cultural heritage' spot. I managed to have clothes made for me in Hue and Hoi An - I was told about this prior to arriving in Vietnam but wasn't quite sure - it was awesome. I had 3 items made for me in 22 hours - incredible!We had to say goodbye to Vu as we flew down to Saigon, where we were met by Tam. We were sad to say goodbye to all of our guides but each one was just as helpful and caring as the last - I am not sure how Indochina Pioneer have so many wonderful tour guides but they are an absolute credit to the company.Saigon was not quite what we expected - so busy. It was a little bit of a shock as we hadn't been in a city since Hanoi and this was even more hectic - scooters everywhere! And I'm not kidding.... Tam was wonderful in showing us around and then onto the Mekong Delta. I was really hoping to see the floating market but we didn't have enough time for that in our trip. The only bit I personally was not comfortable with was the small boat down the river - but I needn't have worried, we were perfectly looked after once again (it was just a bit rocky getting on and off with my camera!).So this was our 14 day trip in a little detail! It was incredible - what we thought was going to be a once in a lifetime trip has really made us think about visiting other areas around because we know we could do this with Indochina Pioneer.Our thanks go to Lam, Huan, Maya, Vu and Tam - without each one of these incredible people we would not have had the most amazing holiday.As you can probably tell - I would recommend this company to anyone wanting to visit Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos - in fact I have already...."

Lam , the manager and our contact at Indochina Pioneer did an absolutely first class job for us. From our initial emails (always quickly and fully answered) to some Skype calls and then to our experiences on the ground in Vietnam, they were superb. The guides they arranged for us were great (\u2018Linh\u2019 in Hanoi and \u2018Nam\u2019 in the Delta area). They were more than just \u2018guides\u2019, in fact, they were great company and that was a major factor in our enjoyment on this holiday.

It was wonderfully arranged by Mr Duong Dai Lam, who was most considerate and responsive to our suggestions. The thought and care put into our tour package was very impressive. Despite visiting 4 locations in 7 days, we never felt rushed; the sight-seeing was both well-paced and relaxing. We were quite pampered as we were shuttled from place to place in a private van (our family consists of 7 members). During our trip, we were also thoughtfully supplied with our own mobile device and sim card with which to contact our tour guide and operator.Much of our time was spent in the company of our invaluable tour guide, Mr Nguyen Giao Linh, who was very fluent in English. He was quite invaluable, providing knowledgeable narrative and cheerful help whenever needed. He was also extremely flexible about adjusting the tour schedule to our needs, for which we are truly grateful. Through Mr Linh, we were able to get a street view of Hanoi and a better picture of the quiet beauty in Vietnam. A brief overview of our tour package: Hanoi, day trip; Mai Chau, village home stay and excellent home-cooked Vietnamese cuisine; Ninh Binh, day trip to historic sites and the beautiful and peaceful Trang An Grottoes; Halong Bay, 3 days 2 nights. Sightseeing Halong Bay simply cannot be rushed! We were very glad that IP had arranged for more time spent cruising this majestic site. The views were truly breathtaking and the staff onboard took every care to ensure each meal a delicious experience.All in all, the service provided by the team at Indochina Pioneer was excellent. We have been strongly recommending their service to our other family members and friends. When (not if!) we return to Vietnam, we will definitely be calling again on the Indochina Pioneer team for their professional help and expertise."

I don't think Lam ever sleeps. Whenever I emailed him in the planning stages he always responded back almost immediately. He customized a most wonderful trip.It first started as a trip to Vietnam and then when I realized we ould add Cambodia he quickly added it to our plan. I really had no idea where to start my plan of this area and that is when I decided to get help and reached out to IP. The trip went perfectly. In fact when I saw the price I said we could upgrade things. so we stayed at beautiful deluxe hotels. Everything went perfectly. We were picked up at the airports, taken to the airports(including aided at the check in counters) and helped in every way. Every tour guide and driver was excellent. Now this is amazing when you see the drivers especially in Saigon and Hanoi. Hats off to the excellent drivers.The cars were very nice and the cold water and cold wipes were very appreciated. The meals they planned for us were all very good and we even had a private luncheon at a monastery just for us. I loved the fact that if we wanted to stay longer at a site it wasn't a problem. I do like to shop a bit and our wonderful drivers and guides were very patient with me when I found a few good places to shop.I think they did a great job being sure we saw the best parts of each location.I do think that was the beauty of using a Vietamese company...They certainly know their own country the best.I think this definitely made it more affordable too. We did get to spend the night on a deluxe boat on Halong Bay (Halong Jasmine). This is not to be missed. It was an amazing mystical 24 hours. As you can tell we had a great time, Lam gave us a phone so he could be reached at any moment (which we did not need).It was so much fun to finally get to meet Lam in person and had a wonderful lunch with him in Hanoi. I can't wait to plan another trip with Lam and Indochina Pioneer."

It was a truly wonderful experience and my wife and I were so impressed by Indochina and their staff. We just returned from a two week tour in South America arranged by another company and that made us realize how lucky we were to use Indochina for our trip to Cambodia and Vietnam. Indochina really set the bar high in comparison! We only wish other tour companies were as caring, detail oriented and professional as Indochina. Kata was our contact and she was superb, So responsive to all our emails and questions. She was a pleasure to deal with and is so committed to the customer . She also met us at our hotel in Hanoi - we so appreciated this personal touch. When one of our flights was delayed, Kata informed our guide so that they could make the changes to our schedule. Our experience in South America was so different - we were left waiting at airports for our pickups, when flights were delayed we found out at check in and were left waiting for hours with no information. Several guides were clearly unhappy with their jobs and had no interest in customer service. We joked that Indochina should open an office in South America and show them how to run a tour company! You are spending significant time and money on your vacation. Your choice of tour company can really make the difference. We would use Indochina Pioneer again with no hesitation"

I started off in Bangkok, up to Chiang Mai (my day with the elephants will stay with me always), Chiang Rai and into Laos where I spent a wonderful 9 days travelling with Sipone and 2 days trekking with BoSand. My homestay was amazing as I was the only western person there!! In Hanoi Kata called at my hotel to meet me which was a lovely surprise - what a lovely lady.I then travelled through Vietnam (Sapa homestay and a cruise on Halong bay plus more) and into Cambodia, ending up in Thailand to spend a much needed 4 days on Koh Chang.My guides and transport arrangements were wonderful, always on time to collect me from airports, train stations, hotels, etc. The drivers drove safely, had cold water in their vehicles and wet wipes to freshen up. Nothing was too much trouble. Travelling alone meant I could adjust my itinerary if I wanted, which I rarely did. My guides became friends and I was always sorry when I had to say goodbye. As they were always local, they had inside knowledge about their own areas. I requested 3* hotels as I felt I would be out all day and did not need to spend more money than I needed. Almost all were of a very high standard, some more like 4*. I also had a 24 hour emergency number to contact if there were any problems - IP thought of everything.Thank you, thank you all, Kata and my super guides, for making this trip so wonderful.

After discussing our wishes, he organised an itinerary to the Mekong Delta and on via fast boat to Phnom Penh.At all times email communications were very promptly responded to.Our guide Thai was superb, and our driver (also Thai) very competent. We felt very privileged to be travelling in style, watching tour groups herded in the Mekong river ferries, village visits, etc, while we always had our own transport and someone all to ourselves telling us all the stories, explaining everything, and answering our questions, etc.Lovely airconditioned late model SUV to get to first destination, Mekong Lodge (tip: river side bungalows cop a lot of the river traffic noise in the wee hours as the fishing boats head out; try to get the ones further in the garden).Second hotel was in Can Tho at the Van Phat Hotel 1. Big shiny hotel out of town (tip: the \"free shuttle bus to town\" advertised on their website is only available to groups). We didn't mind having a quiet afternoon, though. We rubbernecked at the new estate of super-wealthy people's mansions then had dinner at the hotel's pleasant riverside open air restaurant and watched the life of the river go by.The hotel in Chau Doc (Hai Chau Hotel) was ok, a bit grubby and basic. The breakfast tablecloths had spills and bits of old noodle on them, for example. Maybe it's the best of limited options in the price range.We said goodbye to our guide at Chau Doc, and all went well till Phnom Penh, where there was a bit of a glitch as the expected driver to our hotel didn't show and we had to catch a taxi. The accommodation (Willow Boutique Hotel) was very nice, but the hotel had got our booking wrong and had booked a queen room for 3 nights instead of a twin room for 2. Fortunately they had a twin room, but if you stay at this hotel, don't let them give you room G1. It's a repurposed building and G1 has a lovely bank of floor to ceiling windows - overlooking the terrace bar! And side windows overlooking the rubbish bin area. So it's nice for vampires and others who never open curtains, but a bit sad for those who like a bit of daylight.I emailed Lam and received a very prompt apology, and their Phnom Penh representative organised a complimentary dinner and tuk tuk to a restaurant to make up for it. Unexpected, but so nice of them to do that for what were really very minor inconveniences.All in all, we were very pleased to have entrusted Indochina Pioneer to organise this part of our trip for us."

I spent several months researching Vietnam and Cambodia and once I put together an itinerary I reached out to 8 tour companies for pricing. I narrowed down the list to three and asked each company to provide US references that I could contact either by email or phone. Only two companies complied with the request and only one company\u2019s (Indochina Pioneer-balance of review as IP) references were completely positive (actually, after speaking with one reference several times, I modified our itinerary), so I concentrated on working out the details of the hotels, tours, etc with Indochina Pioneer and we ultimately booked with them. I never looked back and was never disappointed from start to finish. After completing the trip would I change a few things? \u2026of course, but I think that would be true of any trip. We booked 3 star hotels with the thought that we were only in the rooms for sleeping, but next time I would price both the 3 and 4 star hotels and consider both. We did end up staying in 3 4* hotels and two were exceptional and one was not. In some locations, the choices were fairly limited and it was in those locations that the hotels were not as nice but we had expected this. We also had some excellent 3* hotels.We had a pretty aggressive schedule because we\u2019re not planning on returning to SE Asia anytime soon so I figured we could rest when we got home. The trip began in Bangkok where we spent a day and a half before going on to Hanoi (one change would have been to fly directly into Vietnam and out of Cambodia or vise versa to gain time, but when booked the flights we had planned on spending a few more days in Thailand). Our itinerary: Hanoi, Halong Bay (Indochina Junk-Dragon Pearl-separate review\u2014all hotels and sites have been reviewed), back to Hanoi, Phong Nha National Park (Phong Nha Farmstay\u2026if you have the time-GO HERE), Hue, Hoi An, Dalat, Ho Chi Minh City, the Mekong, Can Tho, Chau Doc to Phnom Penh via high (?) speed boat and finally to Siem Reap. It was a bucket list trip and thanks to Lam and IP we had a great time especially in light of having to change our schedule midway through the trip to avoid Typhoon Haiyan. As we watched the weather and the storm heading towards the Philippines, we made the decision to alter our schedule. We\u2019re from Florida and realize the potential problems of being stranded by a storm. Lam at IP worked with us as to shorten some of our stays on the itinerary and add Dalat moving us south into the highlands and away from the coast. This involved changing airline flights, hotels, tours, guides, etc. He did this all with a positive attitude while listening to our concerns, questions and decisions. He offered suggestions, we made the decisions and he implemented them, all while we continued to travel and enjoy our trip (IP provided us a cell phone while we were in Vietnam and this proved to be a true blessing\u2026although Lam had to have one of our guides purchase additional time on the phone due to all of the phone calls back and forth!!). What makes this more amazing is that he was doing the same thing, at the same time, for all of his other groups. We had a GREAT time. It was wonderful to be picked up at every airport, checked in at every hotel and as this was a private tour, be able to change our schedule as we wished (although we rarely did). We always had cold water, nice vehicles, good drivers and guides whose goal was to teach us about their country and customs. We questioned them continuously and they seemed to enjoy sharing their knowledge, experiences and thoughts.As far as Indochina Pioneer is concerned, we would recommend them without reservation."

My first trip with Indochina Pioneer was with my family of 4 last June to Cambodia and Vietnam and second trip was with my high school students (14 photography students) in March (also to Cambodia and Vietnam). All the trips have been fantastic, and I trust Lam to organize all the details!We spent 6 days in Myanmar beginning in Mandalay and then to Bagan, Inle Lake and Rangoon. Each place was unique and the short (20-40 minute) flights made it easy to get from one location to the next. Myanmar is changing very fast, so we felt lucky to visit now. There are many new cars on the road and lots of construction. Hotel prices are rising very quickly as well. Travel to Myanmar is not the same as other parts of Southeast Asia as the country does not have the same infrastructure. However, meeting people, learning about Buddhism and the country's complex history and culture, sampling Burmese food, and seeing the mix of old/new everywhere made it worthwhile. Our guides were very hospitable, and I especially recommend Mr. Aung Min in Mandalay and Mr. Moe Zaw around Inle Lake. Lam did an excellent job choosing hotels which were of the same standard as my other trips to Vietnam and Cambodia. If you are planning a trip to Myanmar, I do recommend booking through Indochina Pioneer because there is a shortage of hotels in Myanmar now that it has opened up to more tourism. In Inle Lake for example, hotels book up months in advance during the high season and festival times. Lam also booked all our internal flights (which were always on time.....never mind the size/condition of the airplanes and airports......you get used to it.......). Lastly, he is familiar with the hotels and can ensure quality which is not necessarily the same standards as other places that have seen more tourism."

Lam was absolutely amazing through months of planning travel through Vietnam for a numerically changing group. The number of changes that people made as they fine-tuned their plans got hair-raising at times but Lam was the soul of expedition, patience and pleasantry. And the service on the ground once in Vietnam was at the same impeccable standard. The drivers were excellent and we felt safe at all times. The guides were the best I've experienced. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they took their duties of care very seriously. When I left Vietnam I felt like I was saying goodbye to family. The guides we were with the longest had tears in their eyes when we said goodbye, as did I."

I've worked in and around the tourism and hospitality industry for 20 years as both an hotelier and journalist, and have had some amazing - and abysmal - experiences in terms of tour companies, but Indochina Pioneer raised the industry bar to an entirely new level. From my initial email enquiry back in January, through to farewells at Hanoi airport in May, the service, attention to detail and personalisation was exceptional. Quyen created a bespoke itinerary that took us on a whistle-stop 10-day journey to Ho Chi Minh City, the Mekong Delta, Siem Reap and Angkor Wat, Hanoi and Halong Bay, which pressed all the right buttons in terms of my holy grail of travel experiences - local culture, people interaction and exquisitely authentic food. I could wax lyrical about the trip for far longer than the allowed word count, but the highlight - apart from the scenery, history, people, cuisine - and meeting Quyen for lunch on our last day in Hanoi - was his passion for what he does and desire to showcase Indochina in the best possible light. Other tour operators would do well to take a leaf out of Indochina Pioneer's book. Outstanding in every respect - thank you Quyen; Laos and Myanmar next for sure!"

In May my wife,myself and another couple took a trip to Vietnam that was organized by Ms. Kata Trans of Indochina Pioneer travel of Hanoi. Our trip took us from the Mekong Delta to Hanoi with stops and side tours in NhaTrang, Dalat, Danang, Hoian, Hue, and Halong Bay. The trip lasted 17 days, with accommodation, tour guides, private car transport, train, and airplane travel involved.Pioneer Travel did an exceptional job coordinating the entire trip. To ensure everything was satisfactory, Pioneer Travel provided us with a Mobile phone, and kept in constant contact with us.The Tour Guides were English Speaking, very knowledgable of their areas. Nothing was to much trouble for the Guides. My wife had an unfortunate accident in the hotel, the 1st day we were in country, which necessitated a hospital visit in Ho Chi Minh City, and subsequent follow up visits to a hospital in Danang, and Hanoi. Kata at Pioneer Travel, organized those visits, provided transportation and an interpreter at no additional cost to us. We can not speak highly enough of this Companies attentions to detail, professionalism, and obsession with ensuring our satisfaction. The itinerary they organised for us, gave us the maximum exposure for the time we had, and feel it was excellent \"value for money\". The four of us would have no hesitation in recommending Indochina Pioneer to anyone J Montague Surfers Paradise Queensland Australia"

We were pleasantly surprised by Mr. Duong Dai Lam (\"LAM\")'s attentiveness to our needs via email for months before the trip. He was very professional, flexible, and accommodated all of our needs for our 4 day, 3 night (homestays) trekking tour of Sapa Valley.We were picked up at our hotel in Hanoi by one of the Indochina pioneer people. He escorted us to the train station and then made sure we got on the train in the exact cabin. (We splurged to buy out the whole 4-berth cabin for 2 of us...it was WORTH IT! No one to bother you and you can lock the door while you are sleeping, only $144 per person total).Mr. Lam had booked us with a local Sapa tour company called \"Trails of Mountains.\" Our guide picked us up with a driver at 5am in the morning to drive 1 hour through the mountains to a hotel where we could take a shower and rest before our first day of trekking. It was surprising easy.Mr. Nga was one of the most knowledgeable, fun, athletic, and kindest tour guides I have ever met. He absolutely made our trip. We had a private tour with Mr. Nga, which meant we did a lot of hiking (some strenuous parts, but worth it)....we went off the beaten path and really experienced Sapa. He seemed to know all of Sapa Valley like the back of his hand. It was amazing!Mr. Nga was a great translator during the homestays as well. The homestays were fascinating! I would caution that they are provincial in that there is no air conditioning, little running water, and/or plumbing in some places. However, that is what we expected and didnt mind at all.Hands down, the food in the Homestays were probably some of the best meals I have EVER eaten. Everything in the meal was fresh from the garden or farm (I mean everything, meat, fruits/vegetables, grains, herbs). DELICIOUS!All in all, the tour was amazing. I would highly recommend to everyone. Mr. Lam and Mr. Nga were absolutely fantastic. Ask for them :) The only thing I would caution about the booking with Indochina Pioneer: it is better to pay everything before you start the tour, we paid 50% before we arrived in Vietnam and had to pay the rest while waiting at the Hanoi station for the train to Sapa (it was sort of a hassle).Overall, a fantastic experience, we would definitely book with them again! Thanks Lam and Nga!"

Best choice ever! :) Got my first answer from Kata (our contact person for the whole time) within 24 hours and the first offer was very good. But until we could finally book the trip we had to do a lot of chances - no problem for Kata at all, she put in whatever I asked her to in our program. About the hotels we totally trusted her knowledge. We just wanted to have 3 to 4 star hotels. And I have to say every hotel that we stayed at was perfect for our needs, breakfast was always included. As were the entrance fees and meals if mentioned in our program. About our tour: we did a 3 1/2 weeks Vietnam and Cambodia tour - all organised by Kata. In total we had 3 (international) flights, two trainrides (Hanoi - Sa Pa retourn) , a night at a boat in Halong Bay and the rest in \"normal\" hotels. Everything worked out perfectly - we got a mobile phone at the beginning of our trip to call Kata at anytime if problems would occur. We had to do that once and within minutes our problem was solved, eventhough it was already 10 pm! Every tour guide we had made a perfect job and tried to fullfill every of our wishes. It was no problem to stop by somewhere, leave early or late, whatever we wanted too do. \u00cdf we wanted to buy typical stuff we got help negotiating the prices. In Sa Pa our tour guide cooked a meal in a homestay house for us - a thing we wouldn't have asked for as we wouldn't have know that this would be possible! And we loved it!All in all, I would not consider a second about booking my trip with Indochina Pinoeer again, I would just do it. We talked to people who did everything on their own, it was neither cheaper nor more relaxing or anything. It was just nice to have somebody taking care of us wherever we were. We met Kata once in Hanoi - she extra came to our breakfast restaurant in the mornging - and it was really nice to finally see the person, I've been writing to emails for about 5 months. It's hardly to say what we liked most: but Sa Pa should be a must on every Vietnam trip and I would definitly go to Cambodia too, if I'm there, as it's not a very long journey and absolutely worth it. Halong Bay was also beautiful too, of course. Vietnam in general is a very beautiful country with lots of different things to do and see, I wouldn't want to miss anything that we did on our trip! It was just perfect as it was! Thank you again, Kata and everybody else that made our trip unforgetable!"

Quyen arranged a wonderful itinerary that enabled us to start in HCMC, visit Hue and Hoi An and finish in Hanoi. A busy but great time was had by all 5 of us. Looking back Quyen was able to strike a balance of busy days and also time to meander and take our time which we greatly appreciated. It was a family celebration of a milestone birthday and a really nice touch was the amazing birthday cake that turned up on the day when we returned to our hotel! Everything was organised really well, with guides and drivers always on time- we felt so safe and cared for. All our guides were great and we enjoyed each one's own way of explaining their country and Vietnam's history. Our guides were able to give us ideas on where to head when we had time to ourselves and we appreciated both Thuy and Duy helping us when we needed to change our USD to VND. They both went out of their way to do this for us :-) Quyen took great care in following up with me when changes had to be made to the itinerary and hotels. Also his emails instilled me with confidence that things were in hand and we would not be let down. Thanks so much for a memorable time."

We are extremely HAPPY with the services provided by Indochina Pioneer! Partners Quyen and Lam proved that they have the knowledge and experience to plan a trip that we can now truly call a trip of a lifetime. Our group enjoyed a customized tour with TOP NOTCH buses, drivers, guides, activities and dining. Oh the food was just delicious. You have to try it all. We were overly pleased with their suggested accommodations, Intercontinental West Lake in Hanoi, The Rex Hotel in Saigon and the Tara Angkor Hotel in Siem Reap. Thanks to Quyen for insisting that we spend 2 nights sailing Halong Bay with Bhaya Classic Cruises. Here are just a few little things that made Indochina Pioneer stand out. 1) We were treated to having Quyen as our national guide 24/7. He became one of the family and even arranged a birthday cake for a celebration during the trip 2) It was warm and humid but they always had plenty of free bottled water chilled for us on the bus. 3) Hotel check in was all pre-arranged. They just handed us our keys and we were on our way. Same with the domestic flights. Quyen checked in our luggage and handed us our boarding passes. Couldn't be simpler.We have organized 20+ group trips over the years and this company stands out as one of the best we've ever had! THANKS for an unforgettable adventure. I highly recommend a visit to the beautiful people of Vietnam and Cambodia."

After 2 weeks in Cambodia and Vietnam last June, I planned a group trip with 14 high school students to Siem Reap, Cambodia, Hoi An, Mai Chau, Hanoi and Halong Bay in Vietnam in late March. Once again, Lam did an amazing job panning our itinerary. Our guides were excellent: friendly, punctual and always willing to be flexible with our schedule based on our group's needs. Many of our meals were selected by Indochina Pioneer and included in our group tour price, and they were great restaurants with multiple course meals. Lam was able to make some last minute changes to our hotels to bring our price down when our group numbers were lower than originally planned. I was very impressed with all the hotels we stayed in. Staff was friendly and helpful, hotels were spacious and clean, and all had swimming pools.As always, Lam was prompt in replying to emails and helping us prepare for our trip. Our students are photography students, and our guide in Hanoi, Tan, area was also a photographer which as a great help. The itinerary included many special early morning trips to photographic locations which was a treat for the students. Indochina Pioneer handled all aspects of our trip including flights from Cambodia to Vietnam, internal flights in Vietnam, transportation, guides, hotels and meals. All services were excellent!It is with the highest regard that I recommend Indochina Pioneer. I am planning another vacation to Myanmar in July and have already contacted Indochina Pioneer to help with our itinerary."

I am a sixty year old woman traveling alone in north west Vietnam. i had such excellent and professional service from start to finish. They organized the tour just as I had wanted it. The owner Mr Lam was there to offer all kinds of help . Everything was organized like clockwork . The guide showed up on time, the car was impeccably clean at all times. My driver was excellent on all counts. He always had cold water and a package of wet face wipes, a welcome way to beat the heat. They thought of everything. My driver was courteous, safe, and neat and clean when he arrived. I have to applaud the experience and knowledge of the guide.Often I had access to villages and people because of his professional relationship with them. Traveling alone I never felt unsafe or anxious. I stayed in many nice hotels on my tour. I was always escorted to my hotel, the guide took care of my checkin I literally had nothing to do except enjoy my room. Even at the airport and the train from Sapa everything was looked after exceptionally well. I was very happy with the service I received but more happy that I had hired a Vietnamese company that supported local guides and the local economy when I booked my trip I thought I would try two different companies just in case one was poor I would not be stuck. iI was wrong. I should have stuck to Indochina Pioneers. indochina Odessey presented as a Vietnamese company when indeed they are aChinese company. I did not receive as good or personable service from them. Next time, will again book with Indochina Pioneers this kind of professionalism is welcomed and greatly appreciated by everyone especially women traveling alone ."

We have recently concluded a 23 day tour of Cambodia and Vietnam, arranged by the wonderful Kata @ Indochina Pioneer, in Hanoi.First I should say that i started the whole process a year ago, when we had finalized our flights and nothing else. I emailed a few companies, some in Vietnam and some in N. America. Right from the start i was impressed with Kata, who responded promptly, and got back to me when she said she would get back to me. Between the two of us, this trip was revised so many times by tweaking the category of hotels, or the route! Nothing was too much trouble. I never felt I was a pain in the butt! Our tour actually started for us in Bangkok as that is where our stopover en route to Australia went. Kata arranged our pick up from the airport, a hotel, return to the airport the next day and flight to Cambodia for the 'real' start of our tour. We did 5 nights in Cambodia and 18 in Vietnam. Once the details had been ironed out prior to departure, we were totally at the mercy of Kata's scheduling, and she did not disappoint. We literally were guided along at every step of the way. The tour operators were very nice people, who were so eager to share their knowledge of their respective countries. On arrival in Vietnam we were handed a cell phone, with Kata's number in it, and also on our first day Lam phoned (the boss) asking if everything was OK. Nice touch! As we were travelling without a cell phone (Just an ipad for emails) it was reassuring to know in an emergency we had a phone at our disposal. Our tour ended in Hanoi, and Kata and her husband came to visit us at the hotel. It was so nice to meet the person i had sent (what felt like) hundreds of emails. She was just as charming in person too! So, in short, I would recommend this company anytime, and I would also book with them in the future."

We booked a 3 week tour of Vietnam/Cambodia/Laos with Indochina Pioneer and I can recommend them unreservedly. Very competitive prices for the attention and detail put into your trip - we just travelled as a couple so had individual attention. Superb. Great hotels and experiences and the guides/drivers were superb, it was like clockwork so time was really maximised. Great flexibility regards visits - Lam at Head Office in Hanoi was so friendly and helpful when we were booking the trip, he even came out to meet us at our hotel when we arrived. Hotel d' Opera in Hanoi was brilliant - well worth eating there too, superb food.The guides were really knowledgeable, spoke good English and knew exactly what times to visit places so that they were at their least busy. Exploring the temples round Angkor Wat was a real highlight and we were able to see most places with very few other tourists. Fascinating insight into the culture and diverse ethnic groups and you got the opportunity to see ordinary people in their homes/stilt houses etc which was so interesting. Such a pity that the US deliberately destroyed so much of Vietnam's cultural heritage alongside 2 million civilians! The Imperial Palace at Hue was awesome even though 90% was destroyed by American bombs. You really wonder at their mentality but the Vietnamese seem amazingly forgiving and only look to the future. Hanoi is a crazy city but we loved it once we had got over the initial culture shock. So many scooters/bikes/motor bikes and crossing the road by just stepping out and walking slowly across through the chaos takes some getting used to but we didn't see any accidents - the riders and drivers aren't at all aggressive and all give way easily. Halong Bay is well worth seeing unlike any place I've ever seen.We loved Hoi An in Central Vietnam - great place for having clothes made but also many excellent places to eat. We were there for Tet, the New Year and it was so colourful. The Mekon Delta was very interesting and we took a boat up to Phnom Penh - we only had one night there but very interesting city and totally different to anywhere in Vietnam. Siem Reap and the temples is an absolute must see - truly awesome. The Cambodians were such nice peole even though they have had such an awful recent history - the US killed 600,000 during the Vietnamese war and opened the way for Pol Pot who wiped out another 2 million! I just hadn't realised how much damage had been done across the whole region. Siem Reap isn't particularly attractive as a town but there are loads of places to eat and some great bargains to be had in the shops and markets but be prepared to haggle.We finished our trip at Luang Prabang in Laos, a very attractive French colonial town with some great restaurants and beautiful surroundings. Having guides and skilled drivers (and the drivers really were good, I wouldn't dream of driving in the region!) made such a difference. It was like being royalty and having everything arranged for you and all you have to do is turn up. Everyone was so friendly and you always felt safe wherever you went. If you're considering a trip to Indochina then I would look no further, these guys are local experts."

At each destination the guide and driver were ready and waiting which made us feel very safe and welcomed.All the accommodation was wonderful, even though most of the hotels we stayed at were 3 or 4 stars it didn\u2019t matter as the service and amenities had everything you ever needed.The food was great and my children have now discovered sticky rice from Laos which they love and now expect me to make at home, I just wish that I could find the rice in Australia. Our whole family had a wonderful time and the guides were brilliant. They all spoke wonderful English and were happy to adjust the tour according to our needs. They were also great with my 3 boys (aged 10, 11 & 16) who could sometimes be more than a handful, to put it mildly.We enjoyed each country and I do believe that it was a trip in a life time for myself and my family. The culture and sense of family was apparent everywhere and it is something that will stay in our memory for a very long time. The only thing that I was sad about was the fact that we had to return home.Thank you so much for an amazing and memorable holiday, we will be back and I would not dream about doing it any other way than through Indochina Pioneer.Karma, Chris, Jake, Van & Kobi"

They were always early at airports and our hotels, attentative and polite and saw us right through to check in at airports.We were concerned at booking directly with a Vietnamise agency from the UK but need not have been. They were responsive and helpful throughout the booking process and delivered exactly what they promised.A highlight of the holiday was the boat trip in Halong. The boat was brilliant but a word of advice - you need at least two nights to justify the road journey and to see the area properly by boat.Well done Indochina Pioneer"

            "review": "An outstanding private tour. We just returned from our three weeks in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and could not be happier with the arrangements Lam made for us. We were two couples, and wanted a five star tour. Based on the hotels, guides, cruises, etc, we got everything we asked for, at prices far more reasonable than other companies (like AK).We began and ended in HCM City, to facilitate our international travel through HKG. Using the detailed itinerary which Lam proposed to us, we were able to make modifications to suit our preferences. And wherever available, we flew business class between cities - private airport lounges and special transport to and from planes, makes the small extra cost well worth the expense. The cruise on HaLong Bay was a magical. Watching the monks receive alms, before dawn in Luang Prabang Laos, and the floating fishing village outside Siem Reap Cambodia, were my highlights. But so many memories. Given the US history in SE Asia, I wasn't sure how we would be received. So I was more than pleasantly surprised at how friendly virtually everyone was. If we had it to do over, we would hire Indochine Pioneer without hesitation. They have truly earned all their favorable reviews."

Our family was looked after really well by the guides, the drivers and at the places of our stay. The day meals, accommodation and travels were excellently organized and enjoyable. There is so much to do and so much to take in and our itinerary was non stop adventure time; some highlights in our tour included visiting the historic Angkor wat temple, cu chi tunnels, Meekong delta day trip and the 2 day cruise in mystical Ha Long bay - all are \"must see's\" We thank Indochina Pioneer for a fantastic time especially Mr. Quyen who made it flow so smoothly.

Normally, I like to organise my own itinerary but if my brother was happy with them then I knew I would too. From the moment, I contacted IP I received excellent service. Kata did an excellent job in terms of an itinerary at fantastic prices. Making changes to the itinerary was no problem and it was very much a personalised itinerary for me as I was travelling alone. My guide for the few days in Hanoi and Halong was Mr. Tam and he was excellent, so obliging, so knowledgeable, so accommodating, excellent English and a nice guy to travel around with.My trip involved travelling around for a month to VN, Australia and Malaysia but for me the highlight of the entire month was a 2 day overnight cruise in Halong Bay. It was indescribable, beautiful at night, mystic in the morning and heaven on earth during a sunny December day. It also helped that IP organised a free upgrade to a real luxury suite on board a cruise ship that was just commissioned a few days previously, so, all in all a wonderful experience. Unquestionably, I would recommend Indochina Pioneer to anyone visiting VN whether it be to the North, South or Central, they have great experience, great guides and they are amazingly good value."

I have travelled extensively all over the world- making my own arrangements or using a tour company but this amazing tour of Vietnam that was organised exclusively for us by Kata was the best I have ever done. We started in Hanoi, did a 2 night cruise in Halong Bay, then spent time in Central Vietnam and ended up in Saigon. It was 14 days of an extremely well organised fun trip. The hotels we stayed in were first class - especially the Sun Spa resort in Dong Hoi and every excursion we did was fabulous. Kata even came and met us at our hotel in Hanoi and gave us a mobile phone to use whilst in Vietnam,. We had 4 different guides and drivers and they were all excellent. It was so inexpensive that I came home with spending money ( first that has ever happened to me). Most of the food was supplied and again it was first class and we had most afternoons to ourselves as this was a tour just for the two of us so it was really relaxing. I have come home with a real appreciation of the Vietnamese culture and am attempting to cook Vietnamese food - we had a great cooking class in Hoi An.There were so many highlights - Ha Long Bay cruise, rickshaw ride in Hanoi, the visit to the Buddhist Pagoda with the nuns who prepared lunch for us and the Chi Chi tunnels and the War Remnants Museum in Saigon and thats leaving out all the other amazing things we did.We loved it so much that we are going back to Vietnam next year and of course will be using Indochina Pioneer.I would advise you to take running shoes/sneakers/ sandshoes ( depends on what you call them) as there are walks into caves where the ground can be slippery. My advice - go to Vietnam and use Indochina Pioneer - simply the best."

Lam (Mr) phoned me in Melbourne about 1 hour after my initial email enquiry. That level of prompt, efficient, and interested service typifies the whole operation that Lam enthusiastically runs. He offered suggestions and put together an itinerary within a day, including hotels, flights, trains, boats, and the best personalised guides and transport! I had to reverse the itinerary and no problem, a day or so later, all is done!! Wow. Emails and queries are answered within a day, usually within minutes. Our 3 personal guides were just so informative, so well-spoken, and so proud of their country, and well, just so nice. Nothing is too much trouble. As for value for money, well, this would be hard to beat. I can go on and on. The hotels were great, and our boat trip for 2 nights on Halong Bay on the 'Gulf of Tomkim' (Auco cruises) was a five star highlight. Arranging all this via email from Melbourne did make me a bit nervous that all would work out, and Lam (who in Hanoi came over to say hello personally,) made sure we had the most memorable holiday and experience. We are just so appreciative, so thanks to Lam and our fabulous guides, Truong, Luu and Song, we will surely be back! To anyone reading this .....don't hesitate, you won't be disappointed!!"

First of all I would like to thank Quyen and all his guides and drivers, they were all exceptional.After trying to book our once in a lifetime holiday via the local (Australian ) travel agencies and realising our budget did not extend as far as we would have liked, I searched the net and found Indochina Pioneer and how glad were we that we did. With no haggling or compromise we had a quote for the 5 star trip through Vietnam and Cambodia that we hoped for within our budget and covering everything.I have never dealt directly with an overseas agent so I was a little apprehensive, would we get to Hanoi there after handing over our cash to find nothing booked and no-one to meet us. So before booking I read through the reviews on here and thought it all sounded good. The booking was made and we had all our queries answered over the phone or promptly via email. Best service ever, Australian agents have a bit to learn here.We had a 28 day itinerary, from Hanoi (including Halong Bay) to Hue, Hoi An (Including the Mekong Delta) into Cambodia, Siem Reap, then Phnom Penh, then Ko Kong and the 4 rivers Floating Eco Lodge, finished off by relaxing on Ko Chang island Thai Land and the obligatory \u201cOne Night in Bangkok\u201d . It is extensive itinerary and way too involved to type her, if you would like a copy let me know and I can email, or contact Quyen to build your own.I will try to do more detailed reviews of each stop on our journey when I find the time but in general the trip was absolutely AWSEOME.Vietnam and Cambodia are amazing countries, each beautiful in their own right, both with such interesting, if sometimes very sad history. The people of both countries are so friendly and welcoming, of course we took all the usual precautions, but I can honestly say we never felt in any danger, well except crossing the road the first few times maybe.Due to work commitments we were forced to travel just out of the peak season, but we believe it was the best time to be there, mid May to mid June, although hot (when isn\u2019t it), we had very little rainy days, it did rain a few evenings, but nothing too extreme and never impacted on our itinerary or enjoyment. The only time we encountered any major queues into attractions was the Ho Chi Min mausoleum, but it was his birthday and the queue was full locals paying their respect, it actually made the visit more enjoyable.This is a review of Indochina Pioneer as a travel agent and all I really need to say in professional, well priced and you should at least give them a try if you are planning to travel to this region, we will use them again.The only thing we would like to have been included in our experience is, a little more time being absorbed into the local experience, eating what and where our guides ate etc, I would have like to try the guides favourite Pho stall and coffee shop for example. But in their defence we had booked a 5 star trip and the places we were eating were excellent.Thanks again Quyen and all your team."

I was a little worried about booking our Halong Bay Cruise online but decided to email Mr Lam after reading these reviews on Tripadvisor. Mr Lam got back to me straight away and booked us a 3 day 2 night cruise on the Paradise Cruise line. Mr Lam was so patient with all my questions and always responded very promptly to my emails. He was so enthusiatic and I honestly cannot recommend him highly enough.We booked the tour as part of a trip where we went to Thailand and Laos and one thing which worried when booking was the payment not being made securely but with Lam we used One Pay and it was very quick and secure without us having to email anyone our card details or having to give them any money.Our trip was actually cancelled in the end as there was a typhoon when we were in Hanoi, but Mr Lam came personally to tell us at our hotel. He offered to bring the money in cash in the afternoon but we asked him to refund the money through One Pay as we didn't want to carry the cash around on our travels. He advised us straight away that it would take a while to do but was in constant contact with us until we confirmed we had received the money which was about a month later.I think it is rare to find a company who provides such excellent customer service and would definitely recommend them to anyone in future. We will definitely be using them if we ever go back to Vietnam and would like to thank Lam for putting up with all of my questions and amusing us with his funny emails - he even sent us wishes for Mother's Day in Vietnam and a Vietnamese Happy Mother's Day song to send to our mums!

Also during the trip, we continue in contact with Lam, mainly by email because in Myanmar our mobile phones didn't work, but even in such situation, Lam called our tour guide to let us know that a problem with one of the hotels in our trip was solved. So thanks a lot for all your help!!Initially, we contacted different tour companies asking about our trip, but finally we decide to go on with Indochina Pioneer because Lam's quotation included all the locations and hotels I had requested at a reasonable cost. Also the Indochina Pioneer field team is great, all the tour guides we had in the different locations were very helpful, explaining all the details in every place we visited, always on time and taking care of us from the arriving till the departure, also the drivers, very professionals and safety, thanks to all of them!!We would highly recommend Indochina Pioneer for anyone interested in a trip to Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam or any other country where they operate.

Wendy Stapleton and Paul Norton Victoria Australia June 2012My husband and I had the most wonderful trip with Indochina Pioneers Tours. Lam Duong our first point of contact; was able to accomodate every request we made from day one in Australia via consistant emails, arranged everything that needed to be done before we left and when we arrived he even took us to Lunch in Hanoi and then met us again in Ho Chi Mihn City where we had dinner with his family. Wonderful and personal. We had our own car,( beautiful new 4WD ) drivers and tour guides for the 15 day tour. Yes , just the two of us. Each tour guide was very well equiped with knowledge and English ,consequently we learnt so much more about the people of that particular province, not just the historical facts but their day to day lives, and the way they feel about their country. They were also very well equiped with a great sense of humour ; so much so, that after a few hours we felt as though we were travelling with a couple of friends. We were picked up , dropped off , checked in, and made sure we were happy with everything at all times. Lihn even came onto the train to make sure we had our right carriage, whereas I spoke to a lot of other tourists who were basically dropped off at stations and airports and left to their own devices. Truong even came to the check in at Da Nang Airport and watched us leave. These are the little things that mean a lot when you are in a new country and don't quite know whats going on yet. Hotels were great. Restaurants and trips were excellent. Helped us at money exchange shops...nothing was too much trouble. At every stop we noticed our treatment and standard of ie; boat trips, lunches etc was just that little bit better than the norm and as I said earlier; after speaking to a lot of other tourists we realised we had picked a superior tour company for the same price and in some cases less than other companies.Of course we will go back and .....yes it will be with Indochina Pioneer Tours.We will catch up with Lam his family and our \" new friends\"Thanks for a wonderful experience\" Cheers Big Ears !!! \"Wendy and Paul"

            "review": "Indochina Pioneer-Amazing tour!!!. We just returned from a 16 day trip to Cambodia and Vietnam where I traveled with my son (age 13) and my parents. Lam at Indochina Pioneer Tours helped us plan our Vietnam trip (and all our internal flights including from Cambodia to Vietnam), and we had an amazing experience! I was impressed with Lam from the very beginning because he always replied to my emails promptly and was able to accomodate all my travel itinerary requests before our departure. Initially, I contacted several different tour companies about my itinerary. Lam's quote included all the activities, locations and hotels I had requested at a reasonable cost, and I felt better knowing I was supporting a locally owned and operated company. We traveled as a family with a private car/drive and guide in each location.Once we arrived in Vietnam, Lam contacted us via phone to make sure everything was going well. In fact, he contacted us a few times during the trip just to check in and see if we needed anything. Things were great because we had excellent local guides and very safe drivers in each of our locations. We started our Vietnam trip in Ho Chi Minh City with one day spent on the Mekong Delta in a boat tour. Then we traveled to Hoi An where we had a fantastic early morning bike ride to a local fishing village. We also enjoyed our cooking glass with Gioan Cooking company. Next we were off to Hue for a historical tour of the city. And we concluded our trip in Hanoi followed by a 3 day, 2 night boat tour of Halong Bay. This was a lovely way to end our trip because the bay is beautiful and so relaxing. We had a flight cancellation with our return trip back home to California, and Lam was able to extend our Halong Bay trip for an extra day which we appreciated. He even came by the hotel in Hanoi to settle everything with the changes. He was incredibly personable and helpful, and we really enjoyed meeting him and his family.I would highly recommend Indochina Pioneer for anyone interested in a trip to Vietnam or the other countries where they operate. The company offers top-notch service and they are super flexible and able to cater an itinerary to your needs/interests. All our guides were very friendly, always on time, knowledgable and helpful. Our hotels were clean, the food was amazing, and our overall experience was fantastic. Honestly, I don't know how Indochina Pioneer is able to provide such personal service to their clients, but it made us feel so comfortable and welcome in Vietnam!"

We could not be further from the truth.We emailed Indochina Pioneer, asked for prices, and immediately got responses that were competitive. We wanted a private tour, our own car, driver and guide, from the moment we arrived in Vietnam, with all connections including internal airfares to Laos and Cambodia.Well, all we can say is that from our own personal experience, Indochina Pioneer simply over delivered at all stages of our adventure. We asked for many changes to the itinerary, and they were met with a \"yes, we can do that\". Lam Duong, our point of contact with Indochina Pioneer was able to simply, and professionally, deliver the experience we wanted.We traveled in April/May of 2012, probably one of the hottest times of the year; and our guides in every city would adapt the tour to suit us. We would start earlier because it was hot,then take us back to the hotel to rest and refresh, and then come back and collect us when it was a little cooler to continue our tour. They were available 24/7 and we always felt comfortable. We were never harassed by touts, yet visited all the major attractions. We were met at every airport, on time, with a friendly guide with our names on a sign. From the moment we arrived, we felt connected with new friends.We wanted photographs without the hoards of tourists in the shot, and our guides adapted the tour expertly to suit our needs. They would recommend slight changes to the itinerary to suit what was happening on any particular day, and subsequently, our experience was enhanced. We chose hotels that were comfortable, and we could not have been happier, they have a multitude of choices at all price levels. I would do a check on TripAdvisor on their hotel recommendation, and if I asked for a change, it was never a problem, however talking to other travelers, they were always happy with the Indochina Pioneer selection, irrespective of the price.Would I go back.....in a heartbeatWould I book with Indochina Pioneer again?..........absolutely.For us, the experience, attention to detail, and the personal care we received was beyond our expectations.We can only ever share our experience with fellow travelers and tell them about our adventure. TripAdvisor was such a great resource for us, and we gained enormous value and information from the experienced travelers to these countries.I can only commend the services of Indochina Pioneer based upon our own personal experience, and as I said before, we would be back in a heartbeat, and re-book with Indochina Pioneer.

We spent 10 days in Vietnam (5 in Hanoi, 5 in Ho Chi Minh City) and had originally intended to book all of our tours through the hotel tour desk. However, upon arriving in Hanoi, we realized that we planned our trip over Reunification Weekend, and all of the hotel's options for Ha Long Bay tours were booked. We scrambled a bit, found Indochina Pioneer here on TripAdvisor, and shot off an email hoping for some help. Lam responded quickly and put us at ease: prompt, professional communication, full-service tour handling... he even had an associate meet us at the pick-up location to ensure that we found and boarded our transfer bus. They found the last available room on a luxury junk and basically saved our trip to Hanoi. We were so happy with the service and tour that we walked right past the hotel tour desk in Ho Chi Minh City and booked three more tours with Lam (a city tour, a Cu Chi tunnels tour, and a Mekong Delta tour). We received excellent recommendations, fantastic service, and I was completely comfortable knowing that Lam was just a phone call or text away if I had any problems. I can't recommend them enough... you won't be disappointed!"

We just spent 4 days in Cambodia and two weeks in Vietnam, and worked closely with Quyen at Indochina Pioneer to arrange an amazing itinerary, which they executed flawlessly. Quyen's flexibility, personality and value persuaded us to work with Indochina Pioneer over the other companies we were considering. We made a wonderful choice. You can see all the details at http://maketrax.blogspot.com The itinerary was busy, but outstanding and manageable: Siem Reap, Phnom Penh, Mekong Delta, HCMC, Hoi An, Hanoi, SaPa, Halong Bay. Our facilities were great, and we generally knew exactly what to expect with no surprises (or should have if we had paid attention to all of Quyen\u2019s e-mails). With the exception of Phnom Penh, our guides were remarkably good: from Ly in Angkor, to Thoa in southern Vietnam, to Thuong in Hoi An, and Phillip in the north. The drivers and vehicles were perfect, and everywhere we went people were waiting for us as expected. The restaurant selections were consistently good, though the volumes of food likely added a few pounds to our family. Indochina Pioneer was incredibly flexible with making adjustments to the precise itinerary, as we arrived in places, surveyed the situation, understood more clearly what was planned, and flexed based on the circumstances. We were the focus of every guide and every driver, and Quyen was available through the entire trip by phone to work through any issues. And any question or concern that did arise, and any changes to the itinerary that entailed additional costs, were handled efficiently and fairly. Quyen and his wife and son came to Hanoi Lucky Hotel to meet us, and it was a pleasure to meet him and his family in person. His son is cute and shy, and was very happy to play with the gift that we brought him of presidential cars and airplanes. He and his wife are as warm in person as Quyen has been on the phone.The service, the quality, and the content of this trip has been outstanding, and we are very grateful to Quyen and Indochina Pioneer and all of the guides for making it so. We have traveled to many parts of the world, and the tour planning, assistance, execution and value does not get any better than this."

Having looked extensively on the internet, I decided to book through Indochina Pioneer as they had great itineries and prices to match. From the start Mr Lam was extremely efficient. An email was never left unanswered and everything went like clockwork. Holidaying in Asia already, we had a problem getting a connecting flight to Siem Reap and so decided to fly to Phnom Penh and book tickets and take the express bus. Having mentioned this to Mr Lam he had tickets delivered to our hotel and we were picked up and taken to the bus station. We spent a very varied two weeks, all the hotels were of a good standard, with comfortable beds! The highlights were of course Ankor Wat at daybreak, an exhausting bycycle ride, a homestay with a very welcoming family in the country and after a hectic time in Phonm Phen the luxury and serenity of Four Rivers Floating Lodge. All in all a very enjoyable 14 days. I would definitely travel with this company again."

My Vietnam experience far exceeded expectations - and that was largely due to the skill of our trip organiser Lam Duong of Indochina Pioneer.I travelled with a group of eight who'd been involved in a Habitat for Humanity \"build\" programme in the Mekong Delta area. Our guide's ability to connect with people visiting to his country, sharing its character and traditions, craftsmanship and culinary skills along with its disturbing history created a tapestry of unforgettable experiences. Add fascinating excursions and you have a maelstrom to reflect on!There were laughs galore and lots of mutual sharing of family and traditions.Our guide was flexible and interested in everyone. His amazing capacity to assimilate information is an attribute he sharedPioneer Indochina: generously with us all.Our group had most fascinating experiences: - becoming acquainted with Vietnamese history, the influence of Confucius on society's attitudes (still clearly evident), of their royal lineage assisted by the astuteness of the mandarins, legacies from the French colonial era, Ho Chi Min and his extraordinary leadership and unique style of communism which profoundly altered Vietnam - and to the country's rapid progress since opening up to private enterprise in the last few decades.We travelled to amazing places - mostly by air conditioned coach, but distances were closed by flights. Then there were cyclo rides, boat and train trips and tramps among the mountain home of the hill-tribe people of the north, always interspersed with Pioneer Indochina: interesting stops - and for food!Vietnamese food is devine! We dined in delightful cafe's and restaurants, in temples and street cafes, also in the style of royalty!I absolutely loved their use of herbs, vegetables and sauces - exquisite subtle flavours, blended with seafood, chicken, pork and rice.Beautiful platters of fruit frequently complete a meal. I saw very little junk food here!Then there's the shopping! Whether for jewellery, tailor-made garments, shoes, glasses - you name it - they'll make it!The skill and craftsmanship of the Vietnamese people is amazing - and their efficiency and price structure is so very different from ours!Pioneer Indochina: Family members had asked me to do some buying for them. I was really thrilled with the results - and of the guidance and recommendations made.Vietnam is a fascinating country to experience.The people are delightful - courteous, intelligent, resourceful, generous and positive.As a holiday destination Vietnam simply blew my mind!I wholeheartedly recommend Indochina Pioneer as an excellent company to work through if considering a holiday to Vietnam - for an experience of a lifetime!"

After reading several reviews here on Trip Advisor, we decided to use Indochina Pioneer to book our hotels, arrange local transportation and provide a guide. The cost was substantially less than the quote from a US based International Tour operator. We are really glad we did, as we received excellent service from ICP and had a great time.Mr. Lam organized and managed our tour, giving good advice, checking in with us throughout the trip, and setting us up in great hotels in each location. Before launching ICP with his partner, Mr. Sy Quyen, he worked 10 years as a tour leader for an Australian company. His Aussie accented English is excellent, and he was both easy and fun to work with as we ironed out the details of our custom tour. The included meals were all in very good to excellent restaurants. Our guide \"Tommy\" was with us the entire trip to inform and orient, but gave us free time to explore on our own at our own pace. Tommy's English was also very good, and we really enjoyed our time with him. His love and enthusiasm for his country, especially the beautiful area of Sapa was infectious. Our car transportation was all in new, clean SUV's with safe and courteous drivers. Victoria Sapa Hotel Spa massage followed by hot spiced apple tea in front of the open fire was one of several high points. As was meeting the local ethnic minorities in the village homestay, where my wife, a textile artist, made good friends with a local weaver and indigo dye artist. Chancing upon a cultural exhibition and poetry festival (read in both Vietnamese and English) at the Temple of Literature was also very cool. We finished our tour by visiting the playful and touching Moon Bear Rescue Center.... for you animal lovers, check out Animals Asia website.... www.animalsasia.org. When I first began to work with Mr. Lam I felt he was very flexible and client satisfaction oriented. As our tour progressed, and I saw the attention to detail of our interests and special requests, I felt as though I was ICP's only client. As our tour ended, I felt that Lam and Tommy were treating my wife and I as friends, with primary concern for our health, safety, happiness, and the making of good memories.I recommend ICP highly, and hope to see them again, when I have the good fortune to visit this corner of the world again. You can also see our video review on the ICP website."

We are just back from a 2 week trip in Vietnam and Cambodia which was absolutely fantastic, thanks to the exceptional service and attention to detail by Lam and his tour guides.We were originally planning to do this trip on our own using LP but after researching a bit online, we stumbled upon Indochina Pioneer. I sent out an enquiry just to validate the feasibility of the itinerary we were planning and was blown away at the promptness in response and the willingness to accommodate our specific request rather than point us to a prefabricated package tour. As my interactions with Lam continued, I was more convinced of his professionalism and decided to let him handle the logistics for our trip. This turned to be the best decision we made. Every single day of the trip we were reminded of the level of attention to detail that was paid to every aspect of our trip (an example being making arrangements for a few hours in a hotel room near the train station to freshen up when we arrived back from Sapa - we didn't expect this and were pleasantly surprised). The pacing of the trip was great as well and met the specific things we had requested for. One of the best parts of the experience was the level of flexibility provided throughout the trip and how we were able to make last minute adjustments to the program without having to jump through hoops or to hear about additional costs. As a matter of fact we didn't have to pay a single additional dollar for anything beyond the initial fixed cost. This was great peace of mind and allowed us to enjoy the trip rather than worry about surprises.The few times that we did need help, Lam was always just a phone call away (using Indochina provided mobile phone for the duration of the trip) and was extremely helpful in resolving any confussion immediately. A big thanks to Lam and his team for making our trip truly enjoyable and memorable."

I had looked at brochures of different tours through out indochina but could not get excited or happy with the results.I found ICP on the web the tours were exactly what I was after I could change or tailor the tour to my needs.All the information regarding visas,medical, tips etc were very well covered and we had a very good idea before leaving Australia.Our tour was for 21days (vietnam, Cambodia,Laos) I was given a list of the Hotels with web sites before leaving so I look at all of these and the reviews on tripadviser and was very happy with the result.There were many highlights on our tour the homestay,at MaiChau,Farm visit at Hoian,Buddhist Nunnery for lunch were some of the memories.Hanoi,and Laos were quite special as were the people we meet along the way, so warm,kind and friendly.These are magical places to see and experience, we have come away with some beautiful memories of all these lovely countries and people.Indochina Pioneer has set a very high standard for others to follow. Thankyou Lam for the memories."

Having had a passion to travel to Vietnam for many years I finally decided that this year was the year i'd finally get there. Roping the partner along for the ride I researched and wrote down all the sights I wanted to see and places to visit and hoped to fit as many as possible into two weeks as that was all we were able to have off work. Having stumbled in Indochina Pioneer online I sent in a query (as I did with a few companies) to see what sort of itinerary and prices I could get for a bespoke private tour. Indochina were by far the friendliest, easiest to talk to and gave me a great service on a personal level, I felt I knew the country and the staff even before we arrived! At every stop there was a friendly face and the guides we had were all really passionate about their work and made us feel special and welcome in their country. They changed the timings of some tours to suit us and it was just fantastic to bypass loads of other tour groups with our own guide/transport to make a truly memorable holiday. We did everything we wanted to (which was a lot! 6 places in two weeks) and got lots of advice and help. I felt safe and comfortable at all times. One of the hotels we were due to stay at was under going refurbishment in the lobby so we got a free upgrade to another hotel! We were informed and asked our opinions before this was done and just felt so refreshing to be asked than than be told something was happening. We were given restaurant recommendations, help with finding shopping and checked on to make sure everything was going ok. Thank you so much for making such a great experience for us. Do not hesitate in the slightest to recommend these guys."

From the first email to the last everything was done to perfection. We were met from our cruise ship with wonderful friendly tour guides who knew and told us everything we needed to know about our tour. This was a second visit back to Vietnam for my husband who served there many years before so it was wonderful for him to see how things have changed. Nothing was too much trouble for our tour guides and they even took the time to show us the best place to shop . We could not fault anything about our tours and we would recommend this super friendly Tour Company to all with no hesitation. Thank you so much Tung for all your time and research. It was an absolute pleasure. Jan and John Australia"

This is a new Vietnamese company organised by a young Vietnamese family man who has spent time in Australia and is totally in tune with the demands and expectations of someone who has never visited Vietnam before.We corresponded extensively before booking the trip and were given lots of suggestions and alternatives to this tailor made holiday. We started in Hanoi where we were met at the airport and taken to our Hotel as a couple. The guides have a good grasp of English and extensive knowledge of their country. We went to Halong bay for an enchanting night on a boat, to Hue, Hoi An , Saigon and to Siam Reap. All the Hotels chosen were in the heart of every attraction. I could not have chosen better. We had many guides and drivers and and found that the whole experience flowed seamlessly and without any problem. We were phoned up at least for times to check up on our progress and how we felt about the trip. The manager is clearly very keen to make a success of his business and I can confirm that he has done this.We have experienced Vietanam on a very personal level and feel that we could not have had a bette experience. There were many meals provided for us and the restaurants and stops chosen were outstanding.I would recommend that you check out Indochina Pioneer as a very reasonably priced and safe company to deal with."

Organised a 7 day private independent tour through Laos on short notice and cannot commend them enough on their diligence for organising a faultless trip. Well, I would have to say that our trip to Laos was very memorable due to our fantastic driver 'Jai' who navigated those winding roads without incidence and \u2018Sunny\u2019 our guide, must also be commended on his terrific job. His knowledge and passion for his country, cheery nature and friendliness added to the overall experience.The flexibility of the private tour allowed us the opportunity to stop and immerse ourselves into the local culture visiting schools and villages. We travelled in April which can be the hottest month but found it relatively mild (maybe we were just lucky) although we didn't avoid the distant smoke haze from the countryside farmers burning off their fields.The trip organisation was superb!! Not once did we encounter any problems.  I would not hesitate to refer Indochina Pioneer Travel onto anyone wishing for an Asian experience."

It is not that Indochina Pioneer got us around to the \"must see\" and typical tourist sites so well - it was the consistent quality, across the board, of everything we did, including the \"off program\" items! Kids hot and sweaty in Saigon, they were there with a suggestion of a water park! Group getting too hot and tired to trek around the Hmoung village? Switch gears and visit the house of an individual family. Interested in watching a cart pulley sand up a hill? Let's stop the bus and hang out and do that. Would you like to visit an orphanage/do some social outreach on your trip? That can be planned too (in our case, our trip was two families providing a heritage trip for our adopted Vietnamese chiilldren to see their roots, hence the orphanage visits where our kids presented gifts and money - sort of a \"give back\" to their roots- by the way, the entire Indochina Pionner staff got behind that - the purpose and goal of the trip - so proud to show off our children's birth country to them, so happy that the children, given their challenging start in life, went on to live a good life in America). Our trip was the perfect combination of a more or less set agenda and adventure/serendipity. Viet Nam is a wonderful, colorful,confusing, exciting place to travel. With the right amount of input and free time, it is awesome."

We had some unique requests for our trip to Viet Nam, and Indochina Pioneer spent months communicating with us through prompt and efficient e-mails to get everything just right. The activities planned for us were of excellent quality, and the local tour guides were courteous, caring and extremely personable. The owners of the company communicated with us several times throughout the trip to be sure things were going well, and we still hear from them, now weeks after we are home. We felt as though we were the company's only clients! I would highly recommend Indochina Pioneer when considering Asian travel."

However cruise got cancelled and the man say definitely the next day we can go, so we waited around all day then checked again and the lady there said definitely not. So if we hadn't of checked we would have stayed another night for nothing. The bus however was horrific. They said 24 hours it would take however it took us 70. We got caught in many landslides in Lao, had to drive through lakes and muddy roads. If they and warned us that there had been a storm then we would not have gone. They didn't say anything and they must have known as it was a masons be typhoon in Laos.The bus company: I asked if the company was good, and comfortable if there was wifi and a toilet on board and they said yes. I arrived at the bus, no wifi, no toilet and very uncomfortable seats. Me and my two friends were the only westerners on the bus and we were with a load of Vietnamese men who didn't speak English. They kept stopping and loading packages so we were squished into the bus full of goods. We got to Laos, as previously mentioned the weather was terrible, and the drivers stopped for dinner drank a lot of vodka then decided to drive over the mountain as roads. We hit a land slide and came of the road and had to get pulled to the road again. One of the drivers was very pervy on me and my friend who were the only girls on the bus, at one moment 'accidently' poked my boob. We had to spend 3 days and 3 nights with these men as we had no choice to. We didn't have any food for 3 days. Then to top it off they crashed the bus so we had to end up hitch hiking to our destination in Luang Prabang. I will be writing a formal complaint on top of this review, But please if you want go to Laos fly! Even though it is expensive it is not worth the journey by land."

We arrived on our amazing cruise Silver Sea and the service was second to none exceptional food all the staff were warm and friendly the room we stayed in was amazing.

We book all our flights, buses and trips through her. She is a lovely lady and she is the most helpful, most organized lady you could ever meet. Rose does offer the best prices to book your trips with but not only that she only books the best trips, nothing is a scam here and if you ever have any problems if you call her she will help in any way. She has helped me stop being ripped off from a bus going from Lao Cai to Ha Giang, we called her and she spoke to the guy selling the bus tickets as he was trying to overcharge us. Rose had a swift word over the phone with him and suddenly our price was correct! She will make sure no bus will leave without you no matter what. We just booked Halong Bay on the Silversea Cruise with her and she told us it was the best boat to go on and she was right it was the most amazing cruise I have been on in my life. I can't imagine ever getting service or comfort like that ever again anywhere in the world. Our cabin had a Jacuzzi!! It was out of this world. All of the staff were amazing and couldn't have been more welcoming or helpful. Rose also made sure when we stayed on Nam Cat island for the 2nd night that we had an air conditioned bungalow as we were traveling with my boyfriends Mum. The bungalow again was amazing - ocean view and thank goodness we had air con as it was boiling. She always thinks of the little things you might forget. I would recommend her to everyone. Kim her assistant is also amazing she has so much knowledge too so if you go and Rose isn't there do not worry - Rose has trained her perfectly so she will look after you the same as Rose!! They are a lovely team and have became family to me and my boyfriend, they're always giving out bottles of water to everyone and feeding you delicious fruit. Do not book any anything anywhere else! Rose travel is the only place you need to go for your traveling needs no problem will ever be to big or small for Rose she will sort it out!!"

I passed by this travel agency last year, was looking for a trip to Ha\u0323 Long Bay and wanted a second opinion (at first travel agency everything sounded too good to be true). When I arrived Rose immediately offered cold water, couldn't say no with 32 degrees outside ;-) We talked about the trip, her offer was some 30 $ above the first one, having me already on my heels... But I was soon about to discover why taking the first offer would have been wasted money. Knowing the agencies around, Rose instantly knew which folder and tour had been presented to me and explained what it actually meant: it would have been a much smaller tour where you actually miss out on the most beautiful part. Taking her offer I was kind of shocked during the trip that this was not only confirmed, it was even worse: most tourists took the cheaper tour 2 days 1 night which is a very nice trip on itself. So with 90% of the people returning to the mainland the next day, I was stunned what we got to see and most people don't: breathtaking nature, beautiful litte islands and to make things 'worse' we ended up to spend the night on a tiny island, in a bungalow built right next to the plant-covered rocks with all the noises from the jungle behind you. Words can't describe this idyllic place, I couldn't believe we were this lucky and so many people miss out on it. So I'm really grateful to book with Rose who also offered to take care of my luggage during the trip and to arrange a taxi to the meeting point.No doubt I returned many more times during my holiday, in the beginning to get some information, for train tickets or taxis, later just to have a little chat. Lucky man I found a friend in Rose, a woman with a heart as big as it gets who's sincerely caring about her customers. Couldn't recommend it more and looking forward to get back to Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam this summer!Once Rose is busy with another client, don't you worry, her charming assistant Kim will welcome you with the same friendliness and attitude, listening to what's important to you, giving advice, getting in touch with taxi drivers, tour guides, hotels and taking care you got the best holiday possible.Hope to see the both of you all well and happy soon!"

Since the day my girlfriend and I arrived she was willing to help in any way possible and me having lived in and out off Asia for many years I was skeptical at first, but that water and offering of fruit was just her kindness. She helped us in so many ways and gave us her honest opinion on anything we asked and I wouldn't have a mates go with anyone else as she had never steered my girlfriend or I wrong.Oh btw although I've done no tours through Rose, I've done every visa and any last minute gift shopping with her help.

This is seriously the best travel agency in all of Hanoi and I'll tell you why. 1. Extremely reliable- you always feel like you have a person that you can rely on when travelling. You can call/email/message/messenger Rose whenever you have concerns and she will be on top of it. 2. Affordable prices- Rose is so adamant on getting the best price. You can easily see for yourself. Walk around to a few places in Hanoi- you will very quickly notice that there isn't a single place that won't be able to beat her price. 3. All encompassing- She has you covered with everything. Flights, tours, busses, airport transfers, hotels, you name it, she's got it covered 4. Options- there is never a single option. She will look up every company or tour to provide you with a variety of prices, advantages and disadvantages. So that you can pick what best suits you. There's nothing else that you can ask for in an agent. She is just the most kind and helpful person you will meet on your travels. I can honestly say she is like a mother figure. Would 110% recommend to anyone and everyone!"

We shopped around for at least 3-5 other places and by accident hit on this one. She showed us the reviews on her Tripadvisor, so we trusted her. We heard horror stories of shady booking agencies and Halong Bay tour boats. Our hotel would charge us 80 for the same tour, but Rose cut us a deal for 58 each for the Golden Bay tour. There was another girl on the bus who paid 140 for 3days1night tour, for the same company, and her hotel got her the worst sister boat . Rose made the call straight to the operator to make sure we got the better boat. Yes, the Golden Bay company---and plenty of tour companies have multiple boats under the same name. They are all not created equal. This explains why one person can have an outstanding experience while another will not. Luckily, ours actually look like the one in the catalogue. It was really clean and the staff on the boat was professional. I definitely would recommend booking with Rose since she will go that extra mile to get you the best experience she can. If she can't, she will be upfront about it."

As a Hanoi resident, I was a little reticent about booking through an agency right in the middle of one of Hanoi's most tourist filled streets, but I decided to pop in and ask Rose and Kim what they had on offer whilst I waited on the motorbike shop next door. I found them to be very open and good humoured and Rose even nipped off down the street to fetch me a coffee! We chatted about tour options for my parents' forthcoming trip to Vietnam and I never felt pressured to buy anything. After some further research into the myriad of Halong Bay tour options, I decided that the tour Rose offered was very competitively priced and booked on the strength of their communications. We chose the 2 days and 1 night option through the more remote Bai Tu Long Bay and from the minute we left Hanoi were very well catered for. It was a great experience overall and the company were first rate. Everything ran smoothly, the boat was very comfortable with excellent food and value for money was excellent. I really recommend booking through Rose. She's a great character and is professional and honest to deal with. Both thumbs up!"

Her brother took us to the train station and made sure everything was working for us.

Definitely the highlight of our travels as of yet. The tour guide's English was brilliant. Whilst we wanted to stay in a hotel, rose was adamant that we would love home stay. The best decision we made- had such a lovely home stay family, with tasty food. Never went hungry. I speak so highly of this tour, and anyone who visits Hanoi must book this tour with rose. We also booked a Halong bay tour, which was good value and a good escape from the backpacking world.The weather however was not in our favour, but did not spoil the trip. Good speaking English tour guide and well organised tour. The only let down was the other people on the tour were families, and old couples so night time activities were not happening- but such a small issue it didn't spoil the cruise. So thankful to have stumbled upon rose travel agency, such lovely people who want to help you have the best possible time in their country."

The street is filled with travel agency's so it was by chance that we found a good one. We cannot speak my highly of the services the two sisters offered us. We first visited Sapa on recommendation from the ladies who strongly suggested we do a home stay ( even though we wanted to hotel) , she insisted it was better and she was right! The home stay was an amazing experience where we got to eat with the home stay farmer and his wife and drank rice wine together. We got a very fun tour group too and it was a lovely experience that we were sad to leave. Afterwards, we went to Halong bay with the legacy cruise boat... Which rose organised also. Although the tour group was not as fun, the experience was still unbelievable. The boat was very nice and the option to visit at two bays instead of only Halong bay was a nice option that was filled with less tourists.Rose was also helpful enough to arrange a private car pickup for us to the airport for our departure. Thank you rose travel agency for making our time in Hanoi so seamless and special"

She got into us with a group of people very similar to us, I mean, similar ages and conditions, and she got right because we spent really well. Apart of it, she helped us from Hanoi to process several tickets while we were in Sapa, for example, to go from Sapa to Bac Ha market and to come back to Hanoi from Sapa and without any problem to pay it when we returned. Without any doubt I recommend to Rose 100%, she made easy part of my trip and she is a lovely person. Thank for everything Rose! your spanish friends Marta & Patricia"

But when visiting places like Halong Bay and if you're limited in time, you're going to have to book through one of the zillions of tour operators there are in Hanoi, in which case I would highly recommend Rose. I'm not sure her packages differ that greatly (pricewise or content-wise) from others, especially as she is linked to some of the other tour operators next door and across the street who all seem to offer exactly the same. But... what I really appreciated about Rose is that she took the time to listen to what we were looking for and came up with suggestions that matched our 'needs'. By asking the right questions, she was able to offer us tours which were not too organized and left room for improvisation.We booked 3 tours through Rose: a day-trip to the Perfume Pagoda, 3-nights Halong Bay and a simple travel option (without tour) to Mai Chau. All felt like good value for money.Very much appreciated the friendliness and the time and care taken for the booking process. Many thanks!"

On top of this Rose will make you feel very welcome and when asked can suggest unique places where to eat or drink in Hanoi."

It was so nice and easy to communicate with her no matter where we were even though we didn't have a Vietnamese SIM card for our phone. We could chat with her on whatsapp at anytime of the day!! She even helped us out when we had left Hanoi and we were back down in the south of Vietnam! I sent her a massage asking for some help and advice and she wrote back right away!! Amazing customer service. We also dealt with another employee of hers, Trang, and she was lovely as well. Rose thank you so much for making our time in Vietnam so memorable!!!"

The guides were all very good. With pretty fluent self-taught English and full of knowledge and many opinions and explanations. We were concerned about the mosquitos but not sure that was justified. Probably only in the most remote parts of the country. Dressing light is much more crucial. Even though there was some rain, the guide coordinated the schedule so we didn't miss much. Umbrellas are necessary. This is all dependent on where and when you go. Part of the meals were fixed menus covered in the travel package. Although the places make an effort with kids and vegetarians, more choices with the fixed menus would have been nice. Anyway, the kids had enough of the local food at the end. Tipping is something to take into account when planning the budget - a central issue to the guides and drivers and they will work hard to get the tip at the end. Throughout our visit we received messages and calls from the central office regarding our satisfaction. If there was any question or problem, they were there. Ms Thao came to the hotel the night before we left to get our input and comments. Really outstanding."

Mrs Ha Thao was excellent in making the initial contact and arrangements in a very professional way. Mr Khue was our guide and I cannot do justice trying to describe someone with so much enthusiasm, energy and laughter. They have made our first visit to Vietnam a memorable one. We are already missing them and the friendly people of Vietnam."

Both had superb, personalised service from Julia and I cannot fault her or her team.The first tour was the Hao Lu & Trang An Tour in Ninh Binh, Vietnam. The first half of this tour I was disappointed by:- The itinerary did not clearly mention there would be biking involved;- The itinerary mentioned a \"top Vietnamese restaurant\" when in fact it was a very average restaurant in the middle of nowhere;- Hao Lu itself is quite run down and not well looked after which is a shame considering its history;- The tour guide was very hard to understand and although lovely, lacked any sort of energy;+ The area however is stunning.The second half of the tour was amazing:+ We were given the chance to be rowed through the Sao Khe Lake and its five cave system which was utterly stunning with the rower who was incredibly skilled and experienced through the very low cave ceilings (had to actually lie down in places!);- Again, this wasn't clear on the itinerary but loved it!"

Our guide loves his town and his knowledge of Hanoi fantastic. He kept up his narrative with the same enthusiasm throughout the day. He had a terrific sense of humour answering all our questions fully. At the end of the day, he took the time to show us restaurants where we could sample good Vietnamese dishes at very reasonable prices. The accompanying driver was corteous and never more than a minute or so away to meet us. All in all we had one fantastic packed with history, culture and anecdotes."

Last week a group of us visited Tho Ha rice paper village with Asia Top Travel. Our friendly tour guide, Khue, entertained and enlightened us throughout the entire time. His personal relationships with the villagers made us all feel like family. The trip introduced us to the way of life of these hard-working, creative, warm-hearted people. Having used the services of Asia Top Travel on many occasions, over a period of years, I am always impressed by the promptness, consistency, kindness, knowledge, communication, and genuine caring of each of their agents and guides.

Arriving in and departing from Ho Chi Minh city was the given and Ms Boney then had put together a wonderful journey for the 12 days including Siem Reap and the world heritage site and all the interesting places in Vietnam from North to South. Including an overnight stay on the boat in Halong bay, an eco-tour on bicycles through rice fields, riding the buffalo and working the rice fields"

She would tell us the way to the shopping streets, coffee shops, & restaurants that are just near our hotel. It was such a very nice experience learning about Vietnam in just 2 days.

If there were any changes to be made on the spot, she was just a telephone call away and handled the changes efficiently. The hotels, guides and drivers that were made available to us during our trip were well chosen by this agency. We were met at each airport in air-conditioned and late model vehicles with cold water and cold towels which were welcomed in the hot temperatures. The guides were very knowledgeable and informative. My son and I have now made a lifelong friend in Luang Prabang, Laos with Kood, our guide, who was a monk and elephant Mahout, so we really enjoyed the temples and visiting the elephant sanctuary under his tutelage. Halong Bay was an absolute delight and Angkor Wat in Cambodia was spectacular. We will definitely work with Mrs. Ha Thao and her agency again and highly recommend her should your travels include Indochina.

Tunnel was not too bad but the floating market and garden visit we felt it is not something special as we live in village and had seen fruit trees.Would prefer if a tour guide included in the saigon river cruise and also a proper cruise ticket (not a written piece of paper)as well because it is just so inconvenient without a tour guide. The driver dropped us at the wrong place for the cruise and we were lost and no local number contact. Luckily we wrote down phone no of tour guide and borrowed a phone from a stranger to call him and asked him to contact the driver to pick us up. Or else we have no idea how things will end up. On arrival to the cruise, we handed the piece of written paper to the staff and they took a while to direct us to our seat. It would be faster if we are issued formal cruise tickets."

We wanted to go visit Halong Bay as recognized by UNESCO as historical heritage. Visited TripAdvisor website and its recommending Asia Top Travel. After reading tge reviews, I dropped a mail to Asia Top Travel about my intention. A lot of friends of mine were conned by some of the travel agencies there. Immediately the next day, I received a reply from Asia Top Agency, Ms Boney of Hanoi. She said she will provide a private 1 day tour to Halong Bay at USD55 each. Private tour means not mixing with other travellers, just 9 of us. Van from hotel and crusing boat as well. She really meant it. After some deposit payment, we were expecting the day to come. On 6th July, 8am, its tour guide, Ms Mai presented herself in our hotel and provided us a 16 seater Ford Transit for 9 of us. It took 3.5hrs to reach Halong Bay and boarded a boat just for 9 of us. The boat was so luxurious and spacious. Lunch provided on board was more than sifficient for us, eg tomato fish, steamed prawn, clams, vegetable, stuffed crab etc. And they were delicious. Ms Mai is very honest and speaks good English. She even told us not to purchase any pearl jewelry on the board(is fake). Her knowledge about Halong Bay is fantastic abd we had a wonderful journey. When sending us back, we stop at a Stopover Rest area, selling silk pyjamas and sewing arts. Those were made by disabled from Vietnam war and their descendants. I bought 2 pair of silk pyjamas and its quality is much better than Old Quarter stalls. We back to hotel by 8pm. This id a tour agency that worth every penny of your money. Asia Top Agency, we thank you for a memorable trip."

The tour guide did very best and all effort to ensure we enjoy very much in Cambodia. The whole trip was very safe with proper guidance, we have no worry for safety or transport issues. We can arrange our own time and have our favourite meals everyday. The hotel arranged are also very comfortable. The staff are friendly and helpful. Overall, we are truly satisfy with everything and believe that we will engaged the same travel agency for our next trip to Vietnam or Myanmar."

How they connect and communicate with the customer is exemplary. What I especially liked is that they listened very carefully and asked good questions in the beginning in order to get a precise understanding of what my requirements and expectations were. Their communication was always quick, if not immediate. This made it easy to clarify numerous details that needed to be taken care of in the preparation phase. After that I could basically lean back and just enjoy a perfectly organized and seamlessly performed program.  I was organizing a 3-day business event in Hanoi with them. 50 guests were travelling from Europe, Middle East and Asia to Hanoi for this meeting, so the expectation level was quite high. I had to organize everything from our headquarters in Germany, so Asia Top Travel was my eyes and ears in Hanoi during preparations. They went out of their way to make every wish fulfilled. We got extremely positive feedback on our event & the leisure program combined with it from the guests. Our guests also booked individual tours with Asia Top Travel in and around Hanoi during their free time. It was great to see them coming back from their tours with big smiles on the face and praising the good choice of places, and excellent service and fair prices.  I definitely recommend this agency for group and individual travels and events. Our guests came from many various companies and are business owners, executives and doctors who are normally used to best of best. Still, Asia Top amazingly made them all happy. I think the key is their getting a good understanding of what the customer wants and having access to a variety of quality alternatives."

Asia Top Travel (Ms Dzung )did a very good job to arrange our 14 day tour, I would recommend this travel company to anybody who is looking to arrange a tour of Vietnam. The only point that spoilt the whole trip was the Cruise on Halong Bay with Greyline Crusies that did not like us drinking our own drinks that we had taken onboard. The guide spoke to us who said this was not allowed but we had not been informed of this before hand. Seems that this is to force clients to buy drinks at extremely high prices from their Bar, even no complimentary water is given at meal times."

Right from the start the advice and service I received was nothing but professional. Also, very flexible with meeting our needs. We have around 60 delgates arriving and departing at different times, so I requested Asia Top travel to look after the airport transfers as it was more cost effective than going through the hotel. All delegates arrived at the hotel safely and on time. Mr Tom (Asia Tops MD) was always on call in case there was any issues or no arrivals. Asia Top also organised a Partners Program (for spouses of delegates) and I received nothing but positive feedback from all of those who participated. In addition, a Treasure Hunt/Amazing Race team building activity was organised. This was great fun and Mr Tom and his team did an amazing job of putting this together (and keeping everyone together).On a personal note, I asked Asia Top to assist with a trip to Ha Long Bay for my husband and I. We took a 5 star overnight cruise, which was fantastic and included pick up and drop off. I would hesitate to recommend Asia Top travel for both Corporate and Leisure needs. I will certianly be using them again when I next visit the region."

The set up was easy and non-stressful. We started in the North part of the country and ended in the South. We moved around quite a bit because we wanted to see so many things in our two weeks. We had driver on many occasions and had to take 3 domestic flights within Vietnam. To put it simply, there were many logistics that could have easily been messed up. Asia Top Travel was first class all the way, there were no hiccups throughout, and it was the best 'bang for the buck' i've ever spent. There is a guide or support staff helping you throughout the trip. My wife and I got surprise around every corner. The guides for Asia travel were so knowledgeable and open to discuss any topic about Vietnam. They also do a great job of customizing your experience. There were certain things we wanted to see and places we wanted to go. Asia Top Travel delivered on every little detail. The hotels were great and seemed to be a fantastic partner to Asia Top Travel. The service was above and beyond our expectations. The food was great. The country is so beautiful. But our experience would not have been as great without going through this company. We highly recommend them. And if we have a chance to go back to not only Vietnam, but Cambodia and Laos, we will definitely use Asia Top Travel again."

We contacted Ms Dzung from Asia Top Travel some months before our trip and engaged in many emails back and forth to come up with the perfect schedule for our trip. Initially we opted for a trip to Laos. Ms Dzung was very knowledgeable and well informed about what would and would not work and in the end we decided that for this trip we would go to Vietnam instead. In the end the program we agreed on was fantastic and well balanced. Once in country everything turned out to be well organized and all arrangements were exactly as expected and the entire experience was smooth.. We had nothing that didn't go as planned in our 2 week trip. All the tour guides were punctual, knowledgeable, funny and easy to get along with, which is important when you are essentially together for several days at a time. Furthermore the drivers were all responsible and safe, which is also a great asset, despite the sometimes crazy traffic. Lunches which were mostly included in the tour package were always of good quality and even better, always in clean places and we never had any stomach issues. On top of that, when one of our mobile phones from Europe stopped working, Ms Dzung arranged a local mobile for us so we could be in touch with her if needed. This is clearly above and beyond the call of duty and was much appreciated. All in all, we can thoroughly recommend any traveller to use Asia Top Travel for their South East Asia tour needs. We will use them again for sure."

            "review": "Excellent agent for organising bespoke tours in South East Asia. After reading the excellent reviews from Trip Advisor, we decided to put our trust with Asia Top Travel in arranging a bespoke tour of Vietnam and Cambodia.All correspondence was via emails and our agent, Mrs Ha Thao, was very quick in responding to questions and numerous itinerary changes. From the moment we landed in Hanoi until the end of our tour, we were accompanied by a friendly English speaking guide and a driver at each destination and we felt safe. Mrs Thao arranged all accommodation, admissions and local flights. We visited bustling Hanoi, overnight scenic Halong Bay cruise, pretty Hoi An, historic Ho Chi Minh, relaxing Phu Quoc for chilling, followed by Phnom Penh and Siem Reap in Cambodia. I was not aware that there is an overnight cruise from The Mekong Delta to Phnom Penh, which would have been more enjoyable than a long drive to and from Ho Chi Minh for a morning cruise in the lower part of the delta, followed by a flight to Phnom Penh.Three minor were resolved efficiently and quickly by Mrs Thao once she was contacted by emails. We should have acquired a local SIM card for ease of communication with hiccups or when flights gets changed, delayed and cancelled without prior notification (common in this region) as wifi is not always available or when the office in Hanoi is closed.Asia TT uses a third party local agent in Cambodia, which was not as efficient in problem solving, unless intervened by Mrs Thao. The standards of their cars used were not as good as in Vietnam.We highly recommend Asia Top Travel as a reliable agent for your travels. They do focus on customer satisfaction eg. Birthday wishes for my husband from Mrs Thao as well as the CEO and instructing the hotel to send a lovely bouquet of flowers. Mrs Ha also treated to a Cambodian dinner dance show as a gesture of goodwill, for the inconvenience caused by misinformation from our Siem Reap hotel receptionist."

Our trip was ably handled and arranged by Ms. Phuong Dzung of Asia Top Travel with office in Hanoi, Vietnam. I did the booking online and found this agency which offered the 14-day tour called Indochina Odyssey. Indeed it was an odyssey through the cultural as well as colorful highlights of both countries. We were provided top service from airport arrival, transfers to hotels, city and countryside tours, up to airport departure. The guides were knowledgeable and very cooperative and patient too. We learned a lot about each country\u2019s history and culture, saw very interesting places, and enjoyed the outings and tours to local villages and the river trips. Halong Bay in Vietnam was so beautiful and relaxing. Hoi-An ancient town took us back to an unbelievable era in the past. Internal flights were included in the package and everything went smoothly, guides and flights were on time. From Vietnam we flew to Cambodia, starting in Siem Reap. This was the highlight of the trip, having the chance to visit the famous Angkor Wat and other ruins. It was simply magical to be taken back in time, and to imagine how people lived during that age. Our very patient guide was Mr. Sophy, who took us around the historical ruins and related the history behind the numerous temples and pagodas. Next stop was Phnom Penh, a beautiful city with temples, Royal Palace, pagodas and the ubiquitous tuktuks, which we enjoyed riding in during our free times. Aside from all the excellent and very attentive personal service, we were treated to sumptuous meals in classy restaurants, and there always was a constant supply of cold bottles of water during our excursions. Overall, we felt like queens, especially since we had exclusive transportation services, a car with a helpful and friendly driver too. It is no wonder that this agency is called Asia Top, because they offer TOP services, from beginning to end! Our trip was not only fun, but very educational too. I would surely call them again whenever I go back someday to unforgettable Indochina!"

We, two senior citizen couples from India, used Asia Top Travel for a visit to Siem Reap from 13 to 17 January 2016 and couldn't have been more satisfied.Right from the planning stage, we had a single point contact in Mrs. Ha Thon who fine tuned the 5 day tour in Siem Reap into an absolutely delightful experience.The entire gamut of services was provided - right from pick up at the airport, check in to the hotel, a briefing of what was planned for the day and clearing of any other queries that we may have had right up to the airport drop. The itinerary agreed upon covered visits to all the temples, a visit to the silk farm and the Western Baray, the artisan village and the killing fields, the wat memorial mountain and finally by boat to the floating village of Kampong Kleang on the Tonle Sap lake.We had Mr. Dy as our guide for the period ably backed up by Mr. Chou, the driver. Extremely polite and considerate, both Mr. Dy and Mr. Chou took extra care of the 4 of us in our mid 60's, always around to open doors and assist us in and out of the vehicle. Extremely prompt, they were always at the hotel well before the departure time.Mr. Chou insisted we keep ourselves hydrated and kept plying us with cold bottled water from the cooler in the vehicle boot. Though his English was a little limited, we had absolutely no problem in communication with him.Mr. Dy on the other hand was very fluent in English and extremely knowledgeable. He regaled us with the mythology and stories surrounding these famed temples and the other places we visited. Guided us to excellent roadside eateries because we had expressed a desire to eat only local fare. He was always amenable to a slight deviation provided time and space permitted it and showed us areas where we could do a bit of shopping too.Overall an excellent trip to Siem Reap which was made possible only thanks to Mrs. Ha Thon and her team of Mr. Dy and Mr. Chou of the Asia Top Travel team.An extremely professional group which appears to have got all their boxes ticked when it comes to organisational skills and hospitality.Would definitely use them again when travelling in Indo China and recommend them to others too."

We just returned from 16 days in Vietnam and Cambodia.We have traveled a lot and do not enjoy most group tours and have been using local agents and guides recommended on Trip Advisor for several trip to exotic places like the Amazon and now Vietnam and Cambodia.. I got proposals from 3 agents in Vietnam and selected Asia Top Travel, a smaller agency in Hanoi with high recommendations. Ms. Ha Thao was excellent throughout, with good recommendations. We made a number of changes which she did without problem. We upgraded to luxury hotels, which were all well selected. One night we had a noisy room. The hotel changed us, but Ha actually responded at 9 PM that same night and followed through the next day. Her guides were all great, and I would like to give a special thanks to Nang Cong in Hanoi and Wibol (pronounced Vibol) in Siem Reap who were truly exceptional. All our guides spoke good English, were on time and took care of our every need including getting us through the airports and making last minute adjustments when one of us was not feeling well. We added a Gecko Eyes cruise on the Mekong booked through Asia Top Travel and that was perfect. I would highly recommend that cruise which was on one of their smaller boats for a couple. Ask for our guide Dave (De in Vietnamese) who was also exceptional and took care of everything for the cruise. I would add that some of the drives were over 3 1/2 hours like to the Mekong. Our first car was a little small by American standards for longer drives, and Ha upgraded us to an SUV at no charge.Very impressive to do a 16 day trip without a glitch. Thank you Ha."

We, a mid 60's couple from the USA, used Asia Top Travel for a 5 day/4 night tour of the Siem Reap, Cambodia area, with 3 FULL days of touring about. It went off without a hitch. They can arrange everything for you~ from airport pick up, to lodging, meals, sightseeing and airport drop off!! I compared their pricing to other tour companies in the area and they were the best around. Mr. Ny Danith, our tour guide, and Sopheap, our driver, were punctual, courteous, professional and very knowledgeable about the culture and history of the area. Their English was excellent. Pick up times were prompt and they always had a story to tell about where we were or were going to next. They helped us to modify our itinerary along the way to make the smoothest time of our days and we were able to fit in every temple that we had identified to Asia Top Travel! Ny's patience for us 'Old slow folks' moving through the temples was exceptional, and Soheap was always there to open the car door for us and have a cold water available. They also had great suggestions on the best markets for gift/souvenir shopping and restaurants. They went out of their way to help us have a pleasant Holiday and would drop us off at what ever area we wanted after the days tour was completed.A special thank you to Ngo Thanh Tam (Ms. Boney), from the ATT Hanoi Office. She was responsive and supportive from our very first e-Mail contact until the last day of the tour and our arrival back home. She was able to suggest ideas on what to see and do and was a wealth of information! ALL these folks made our Siem Reap visit an outstanding success.....We would recommend the Asia Top Tour Siem Reap Team to anyone, ATT to everyone, and we are already configuring a 12 day Viet Nam tour in 2017 with the aid of Ms Boney.THANK YOU so much!!! We could not have asked for a better experience.......Bill Gossett & Marcia Seewald"

We had a different guide in each city and each was excellent with good English language skills. We were a small group of 7 plus guide. They were very flexible and accommodating and quite willing to change the itinerary to meet our requests (fit in an elephant ride).

Was expecting a very jam packed experience but was disappointed with what we did on the day.stopped by a temple and learnt a bit about the place and then went to a restaurant for lunch which was very underwhelming and we had to pay extra for drinks. Then we went on the row boat ride. The old lady asked us to help paddle the boat which we did at first because we felt bad but then we ended up paddling for the whole time!... It was hot and we only went through 2 caves and the rest of the time was just rowing and rowing. We wanted to take photos on the way there because the scenery was nice but the car never offered to stop for us. We wanted a more of scenic drive included but nothing much more. It was a nice experience but for the price I think it could have been better."

Asia Top Travel has served me very well in the past so I decided to book their half-day tour of Tho Ha Rice Paper Village for our group of three older women. It was a delightful experience, a welcome respite from Hanoi's frenetic pace. We were met exactly on time and our tour guide, Khue, enthusiastically regaled us with fascinating information and insight into the culture, history, food, and daily life of the place and its people. The village is nearby yet far away, accessible only by a tiny ferry. The entire village is devoted to producing the rice paper that wraps spring rolls. Everywhere you look (yes, everywhere ~ in every direction) you see rice paper drying on woven bamboo. Everything is made by hand and dried in the sun. We had an opportunity to try our hand at making the round rice wrappers. A highlight of this tour was a visit to a traditional home where we were treated to a musical performance by the home owner, playing various traditional stringed instruments. We all enjoyed the opportunity to peek into rural life and learn more about the process of producing a ubiquitous staple food. We highly recommend this tour, and any of the services and tours offered by Asia Top Travel."

Of note, please make sure Mrs. Ha Thao of Asia Top Travel (headquartered in Hanoi) is not confused with another Mrs. Ha based in Danang.From the very initial planning stages, Asia Top Travel assisted me in every aspect of our trip. We were a group of 6 adults and the company arranged a fabulous 10 day private tour of Vietnam and Cambodia, which included an A/C minivan, 3 internal flights, 4 and 5* hotels with breakfast, most lunches, and the best guides that IndoChina has to offer.I had started my research almost a year ago and had corresponded with many local travel agents and finally decided to go with Asia Top Travel, not because they were the most competitive in pricing, but because I felt very comfortable with their organization. They are known to personally check out the hotels and restaurants they recommend and Mrs. Ha was always very prompt with her replies to what ever question or request I had. She was extremely resourceful and most of all patient with me. I felt we agreed on a very affordable price for the tour and she also agreed to my terms of payment which worked out great for our group. The minivans for our transport were new and had the best A/C (so needed in Vietnam and Cambodia), 3 rows of seats, (each couple had a row to themselves) and plenty of room for luggage storage.We were met at all the airports by our private guides who spoke good English and were always punctual and pleasant and very knowledgeable. I must though, single out Wibol in Siem Reap who catered to our every need and went out of his way to make sure we were happy. He was willing to extend his time with us and as an added bonus, he kept us entertained with song!!Included in our tour was a one night Halong Bay cruise on Bhaya Legend ~ a private 3 cabin luxury boat which I would highly recommend.The 4 and 5* hotels were exceptional except for the White Mansion in Phnom Penh. It is an old hotel badly needing some serious remodeling and a good interior designer. The Sofitel Metropole in Hanoi, Intercont in HCM City and the Victoria Angkor in Siem Reap were absolutely fabulous.Everything went off really really well except for a little hiccup at the airport in HCM City. One of our party did not have a single open page on her passport and the airline initially refused to put us on the flight from HCM City to Phnom Penh. A Visa to enter Cambodia can be obtained at the airport (photos can also be taken at the counter for $3.00) however, you MUST have an open page on your passport to paste the visa which comes as a one page sticker. Eventually, after checking with Cambodian authorities, they agreed to staple the visa sticker and we were permitted to board the flight. I have made note about this so that anyone reading my review will be educated about immigration protocols in some countries.We had a wonderful trip/reunion and I have to stress that it was certainly a memorable trip for us all, made possible by Asia Top Travel. Thank you Mrs. Ha Thao and your team of experts."

The itinerary was excellent and very well thought out, all arrangements ran very smoothly - travel, hotels, etc. All the staff were very professional, from the booking team to the tour guides and drivers in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap.

We made the trip with my wife's parents, so it was a group of four. We have been on tours in India, Asia, Europe, South America and Europe and this was by far the best overall experience. The driver and tour guide were extremely professional. They accommodated every request we could make, and even requests which we didn't think to make. Our three day tour included Halong bay, a city tour, a foot-pedaled guided boat ride and many more experiences. Every single thing that we did was wonderful. The guide never left our side, expect when requested for a bit more time in a location. He gave us plenty of time when needed, and kept us on schedule.He was a very friendly young man and discussed many things about the Vietnamese lifestyle, culture, importance of family and language. He was very proud of his country and enjoyed discussing these things. He did not talk constantly, and would let us sleep when we wanted to, as some of the drives were quite long.Of everything that we did, I would highly recommend the Halong Bay tour. We were very lucky on the day we went. The entire boat (which could have easily seated 50 people) was just for the four of us. It was an amazing experience which I can say was definitely once in a lifetime. I will always be grateful to Asia Top Travel for such a wonderful adventure. I will definitely use them again for any of my travel needs in the region."

Since making the initial booking there have been numerous emails back and forth as Vietnam Airlines frequently rescheduled our flights. On arriving at Hanoi airport for the flight to Da Nang we discovered our flight had a major delay and that the airline could put us on a flight which was about to close. Having checked in and with our mobile phone not working we quickly emailed Mrs Ha to advise the change of arrival time. Imagine our pleasure and relief on arriving at Da Nang to discover her driver, smartly dressed and waiting for us with his sign. The car was new and immaculate with bottles of water. We were most impressed with the professional service and have no hesitation in recommending Mrs Ha. While we did not have the time to do any other touring the attention to detail with our transfer indicates that Mrs Ha is a professional operator with high customer service standards."

The tour was well priced, private and took in all that these two wonderful countries have to offer. We can honestly recommend Ha Thao and the team and Asia TopTravel as excellent providers of quality tours at very reasonable prices."

Even though we contacted Asia Top Travel after 9pm we got a response right away and could organize the whole tour to our and our kids needs for the next morning and this even on Vietnamese New Year! I consider this a fantastic and flexible customer service! The tour was very well organized and everything incl the car, driver, guide, food and the selected stops were exactly as we wanted it! Many Thanks to Mr. Tom and his team for making Hanoi a great experience! Highly recommended!"

Our driver was prompt, polite and animated giving us history and stories on our drive which took us outside Hanoi past interesting shops and houses. The ride was comfortable and actually was as much a part of the day trip as anything. Once we reached the small river and crossed on a ferry to Tho Ha Village, we walked along a dirt path which was the main street. We were directed to a community house and were served tea by the village elder. Charming! Then we made our way through the village to our host home which was clean as a whistle. The lady of the house demonstrated how to make rice paper for spring rolls and gave us each a chance to make a few. Fun! We then went inside their lovely home and enjoyed a freshly cooked meal which consisted of so many different dishes that we could not possibly eat it all. Our guide had explained to us earlier that we should not try to eat everything because they prepare more food than necessary in order to feed the people who prepared it as well. We had been a little concerned about hygiene but no worries at all. The food was delicious and had been prepared in a clean and healthy environment.After the meal the host played a little music and ended by serving tea and dessert. It was a lovely day. So glad we took the opportunity to venture out into the country as we saw more of the French architecture that we had so wanted to see in Hanoi. Lovely day!"

As with my review respecting Wandee Tours in Bangkok, we were also skeptical in booking a private tour to Halong Bay with Asia Top Travel & putting down a deposit. Fortunately we found Asia Top Travel to be fair, honest & flexible. We (10 of us) were met by an Asia Top Travel's guide holding a signage with our group name, as we disembarked our cruise ship in the morning. Our transportation was a fairly new, comfortable, air conditioned bus, capable of holding 20. The guide spoke fairly good English. We were driven to Tuan Chau Int'l Marian Station, where we boarded a \"junk\" hired by Asia Top Travel. The junk was nothing to look at from the outside, but was comfortable & nicely furnished on the inside with hard wood flooring & walls. The furnishing included 8 - 10 hard wood booths, which seats 6 people comfortably. The kitchen & washroom area appeared fairly clean. There is also an opened upper deck with seating. Life vests for all were available. Our day tour (approximately 8 hrs.), included a very good seafood lunch. The cost for our day trip per person was about the same as the half day excursion offered by the ship which does not include lunch. By going with a private guide, we could control the amount of people per bus, per junk, where you want to stop, what you want to see & what you want to eat. For skeptics like me, I would recommend Asia Top Travel as your guide for Vietnam."

Ms. Hao Tao welcomed us in Hanoi and contacted us from the beginning of our trip requiring information about our impressions and if there was any problem. We visited Vietnam and Cambodia for a 15 day trip starting from the south to the north and everything was prearranged in each town with guides and drivers. The tour guides were always on time, friendly and attentive to our needs.Asia Top is a reliable travel agency and I would strongly recommend it.Panos - Lia"

The tour was made in a comfortable van for three pax plus tour guide and driver. The guide, Mr Tree, was all the time warm and very attend to our needs. We visited markets, temples, and expended a wonderful night in Mae Kamphong, living with a local family (thank you Mrs Ram for your hospitality) including a bath in a waterfall and a thai massage.

First of all well done on recruiting Phuong Vy (Ms.) in your business.I applied to several online sites in January 2014 and Asia Top Travel was first to respond with the other agencies only replying 1 week later. From the moment Vy made contact she made me feel like I am royalty.Vy helped me use One Pay and followed up with me every step of the way. She confirmed the driver picking us up the day we arrived in Ho Chi Minh City and when the wonderfully air conditioned van picked us up(it was 35deg outside).The tour guide was on time and took us on the first trip of Cu Chi tunnels and Saigon city. The guide refreshed us with cold water all the time to rehydrate us as the heat was crazy. The guide was well informed on Vietnam and answered all our questions with ease. He made us feel like we were part of the war as he made us relive the war memory.Halong Bay tripFirstly we use Agoda to book all our hotels when we travel and we always read reviews in order to make up our mind because we all know a picture on the internet does not speak a 1000 words. Phuong Vy (Ms.) recommended Gondola hotel and thanks to her what a remarkable experience we had in this hotel. Thanks again VyAll I can say is WOW WOW WOW. The original boat was not available at the time that we were to sail and Vy knowing that we had my uncle and aunty was with us and Vy originally booked interleading rooms for us which we thought was out of her way fantastic,she then let me know that the boat was being renovated but she still booked the only 2 rooms on the top deck next to each other.Asia Top Travel we will use your services wherever we can.Angelo BaileySouth AfricaCape Town"

He is knowledgable on Ho Chin Minh where abouts and places to visit besides those in iterinary. His driving skills are excellent. Most importantly, me and my family feels safe and secure putting our lives in his hands. Then there is Mr Tam, our know-it-all tour, and multi lingual tour guide. He speaks in the humblest but most interesting way. Also taking into concern on our family's needs and comfort.

I had a great time with Asia Top Travel, Tho and his team sorted a 3 day cruise in Halong Bay after i arrived unplanned and unannounced the previous day. He took the time to meet me at my hotel the night of my arrival and take me on a night time motorcycle tour of Ho Chi Minh city without any hesitation, even though i had only announced my arrival some 2 hours earlier. This was for him, a 2 hr round trip on a week night after arriving home from a working day, just to make sure I was sorted and was taking advantage of every oppertunity to see the sights, with only 2 hrs notice. At my request we went to a local bar district after the evening tour and had a couple of beers to finish the evening before heading home for the night.The following day the Asia Top Travel staff were accommodating and understanding of the unplanned nature of my trip and did whatever they could to make me feel welcome and get me on my way to Halong bay for a very relaxing and interisting few days on the bay. the guests on the boat were a great bunch of people, some travellers and some holiday makers, which made for a good mix of personalities and conversation. As a lone traveller/holiday maker, i had a great time and made a few friends with whom I still keep in touch with.I highly recommend Top Asia Travel to any traveller, wether planned or just finding themselves in Vietnam unannounced and looking for assistance to see and do those things that others talk of.Awesome people and personalities, one stop Vietnam Shop."

And the price of the whole trip was very good compared to other companies, especially if I booked from Europe.

We were a part of a group of six, four from U.K. and two from Australia on holiday in Vietnam & Cambodia stretching over a period of twenty days. The trip advisors Mrs Ha Thao & M/s Kim were absolutely flawless in arranging the whole trip covering Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Long, Ninh Binh, Hoi-an, Hue, Ho Chi Minh city, Can Tho in Mekong delta, Cu Chi in Vietnam followed by Angkor & Phnom Penh in Cambodia. There were no hiccups; Kim was in touch with us all the time right along the whole trip, listening and responding to our requests when the itinerary needed tweaking at odd occasions. The advisors and the tour guides took exceptional care of the group from the time we started till the very end of the tour. The first point of our contact was Mr. Phong who deserves special thanks as he even went out of his way to do favours for us, with a broad smile. In short he did make an impression in our hearts which would linger for a considerable time to come. The Vietnamese people are so friendly and hospitable; so much so Mrs. Ha Thao on our way to the hotel from the airport even hosted us for tea at her private residence along with her family. This gave a personal touch to the whole trip. We found this heart warming.Across the board the accommodation was good and some exceeding our expectations. A special mention about Gondola Hotel in Hanoi which is located conveniently not far away from the places of interest and the hustle and bustle. Even better were the welcoming friendly bunch of staff who made us feel very homely. This was a fantastic way to start the tour. The experience in Hanoi was so great, did not feel like proceeding with the tour.Every leg of the tour the guides were quite knowledgeable, friendly and obliging too. It was so full of ancient & recent History and about the diversity of heritage and cultures of the people. The enormous amount information the guides gave was at times too much to grasp and remember. How ever this was educational. It would not be fair if a special mention is not made to Tam ,Tony and Sam who were our respective guides in Ho Chi Min city, Hoi An and Phnom Penh. The were as good as Mr. Phong in their local knowledge, caring and obliging.Would like to sum up saying it was a fantastic & memorable tour the memories of which will remain with us for quit a while. The credit for this should go to Asia Top Travel and the whole team who made this possible. For all this, the prices were very competitive, well affordable without any compromise in quality of service. We would certainly recommend ATT to anyone who is planning to have a holiday in Indo China, with confidence.Again a big Thank You to everyone at Asia Top Travel.Mr. & Mrs. SivapalanBerkshie, U.K."

We traveled to Hanoi, HaLong Bay overnight cruise, Hoi An, DaNang, Hue and to Saigon. During my initial search for a tour company. I found Asia Top Travel prices to be very competitive, and very reasonable. From the first email, all my questions and inquiries were answered very promptly by Ms. Yang. Throughout the planning process she was very efficient, responsive and helpful, making any changes along the way to finally put together the perfect itinerary for us. From the time we arrived in Hanoi, being met at the airport, transferred and checked in to our hotel, to our departure when the tour ended in HCMC, Asia Top Travel was so well organized, and took care of every little detail. All the tour guides in each of the cities we visited were very professional, knowledgeable, extremely helpful and very friendly. They made our tours very interesting, and a lot of fun. We were very impressed by the level of service and attention. Even when I emailed over the weekend, the Director would reply informing I would get a response when the office opened on Monday. The hotels were all good, as were all the meals and food. The transportation and tours were handled very efficiently and on time.Thank you Asia Top Travel, and Ms. Yang, for being so wonderful to work with, and for making our first visit to Vietnam so very enjoyable and memorable."

I contacted Asia Top Travel and they were very easy to work with and were able to schedule the tours and activities that we wanted to do even though it was a short stay. They also took care of our Visitors Visa. Our tour guide, Mr Phong, was wonderful. He picked up on time at the airport and helped us get checked in at the Hotel and on the city tour he was very knowledgeable about the history of Hanoi and the sites we visited. And when he took us back to the airport, he helped us get checked in at the airlines and made sure we got to correct area to go through customs. They booked us at the Gondola Hotel. It was very nice and Hotel staff was excellent and very helpful. It's located in Old Hanoi just a block from Hoan Kiem Lake. There is also a Walking Street location just a block from the hotel for plenty of shopping. I would definitely stay there again when I make it back to Hanoi in the future. The Ha Long Bay cruise was amazing. The boat was clean and the food was excellent.And the off boat excursions were wonderful. We kayaked, went to a beach where we could swim and we took a tour of a big cave in one of the mountains in Ha Long Bay. It was awesome! We took a lot of great pictures. The tour guide. Happy, was also great. I would definitely recommend Asia Top Travel. Our vacation was very affordable and we really enjoyed our visit to Hanoi and Ha Long bay. We are planning another trip to Cambodia and we absolutely use Asia Top Travel."

We were in Hanoi from 14th of September until 18th of September and we chose Asia Top Travel to organize our travel due to the excellent references that we had and the interesting prices that they offered to us. The only thing I can say after been traveling during many years is that this trip is one of the best experiences that we have never had. My wife and I arrived from Hong Kong, where we are living although we are from Spain. Mr Hue, our guide was waiting for us in the airport, they transport us to the Hotel with Mr Tom as the car driver. The car was very comfortable and clean. The hotel was a 3 stars hotel in the mid of the old quarter. The room was interior one, but very comfortable, clean and quiet, wonderful bed (king size) with good mattress. The breakfast was really good, a eastern and western buffet and was included in the package as well. The staff were very kind all the time.Our guide picked up us on the Hotel the day after for a city tour including the visit to the most visited places, always by car and including a nice lunch in a French restaurant (included on the package with a yummy degustation menu) and a unforgettable trip in rikshaw through the old quarter.Second day included a very interesting visit to Hoa Lu temples and the amazing visit to Tam Coc, including again a nice lunch. Our guide and driver again were with us all the day. The third and fourth day was our cruise in Halong Bay. I can only speak well of our experience there, the boat itself, the meals and the warm and kind staff offered us one of the best experiences traveling around the world. The trip through Ha Long Bay doesn't need any comment, one of the beautiful scenaries in the world while you are having your dinner or relaxing in your room. The trip from Hanoi to Ha Long and come back was in a minibus and was not very comfortable due, principally, to the bad state of the road.From Hanoi our kind guide and his driver brought us to the airport for come back Hong Kong. I can only say thank you to Ms Kim, from Asia Top Travel agency, for her professional and kind attention to us all the time, including changes in the schedule with just few days. I would like to thank our guide Mr Hue and Mr Tom our driver for so beautiful experiences and explanations. Finally thank you very much to Phoenix Cruises staff and specially to Mr Hung and Ms Hoa for that unforgettable sailing in Ha Long Bay.I can only recommend this agency to everybody who wants to travel to Vietnam.Federico LopezMontserrat Cusc\u00f3Hong Kong"

In particular I would recommend Si Ha who guided us expertly around Pnom Phen and Battambang, and Fang who was our wonderful guide in Hanoi. The hotels we used were all fab except for the one in Saigon, although I did do quite a lot of work myself checking each hotel on Trip Advisor.

We thought this would most likely not occur due to only giving Tham 12 hours notice. To our delight she re-arranged our itinerary to our specifications and managed to book us a flight instead of the overnight train.We especially loved the small details; Tham told every restaurant, tour guide and hotel that it was our honeymoon so we felt that extra bit special.

Tham was very flexible, offered many good suggestions, and handled our visa arrangements. Our trip went from North to South and included urban areas, but also a fascinating visit to a Red Dao village in the far north and a really interesting day-trip to the Mekong Delta, where we visited a number of small businesses and traveled around via bicycles, canoe, and riverboat.During our 17 days in Vietnam we stayed in 7 different lodgings, had 6 guides, and 7 drivers. The guides were fun, quite helpful, and spoke excellent English. The drivers were reliable and safe. Everything ran on time and as planned, without any problems. We felt as though we had a network of people in Vietnam watching out for us. Tham called us several times while we were traveling to make sure everything was going well.

We only had time for nine days and eight nights in Vietnam and it made sense to use a tour company. We opted for the 'Tonkin Elegance Tour', which gave us four nights in Hanoi, one in Sapa and one on the 24-hour cruise at Halong Bay, plus two nights on an overnight train, which was an enjoyable adventure. Our contact, Ms Huyen Nguyen, was excellent. She answered all our questions very quickly, in a very friendly manner, and in faultless English. She offered us a choice of a three-star tour at $710 per person and 4-star at $875. We chose the latter, and this gave us two nights in Hanoi at each end of the trip in the superb La Siesta hotel in heart of the old district. A small supplement also got us onto the excellent (and apparently best) cruise ship on Halong Bay, the Dragon Legend.The tour was well thought-out and superbly managed. Guides and drivers showed up exactly as scheduled. We had a private car or minibus for all transfers, and a guide to ourselves, which meant we could have interesting and detailed conversations with them. The two overnight train trips from Hanoi to Lao Cai (the train station nearest to Sapa) were rattly but clean, and we enjoyed them. On our last full day we added an optional trip to Ninh Binh province, which made an interesting contrast to eh Vietnames highlands. Our Indochina Voyages contact, Huyen, was very clear about charges and conditions, what was included and what would be extra, and we were extremely happy with the service we received. If we are lucky enough to be able to visit Vietnam again, we won't hesitate to contact the company."

I only had 2 weeks and wanted to do my own trip but with the time limit didn't want to waste any time at all. I contacted Huyen who guided me where to go and once we had that sorted she organized all airport transfers, Halong Bay tour, city tours, train & air tickets, Mekong Delta tour. Arriving in the chaos of Hanoi and seeing our driver with our names was just the best, and within 1/2 hr we had arrived at our hotel and were out sightseeing. Everything went so smoothly, I was in constant contact with Huyen and if I wanted to change anything she would act immediately. I loved everything about my trip and without a doubt I would recommend Huyen to any fellow travellers. The cost wasn't much more than it would have cost me anyway but the convenience was SO SO worth it. Excellent, Excellent, Excellent."

It was a very personalised tour for our group that enabled us to meet the local people and immerse ourselves in the culture. From Hanoi to Ha Long Bay then up to Sapa, then back to Hanoi then on to Hue and Hoi An everything was organised by Nam from being picked up at the airport, to accommodation to day trips and even a cooking class. Nam made everything so easy it enabled us to just sit back and enjoy our holiday. I wouldn't know where to start on trying to chose the highlight of our trip, it was just one adventure after another, but Sapa and Hoi An exceeded my expectations and that is thanks to Nam. The guides were wonderful, all spoke English and were extremely informative so a very big thank you to them all. I would 100% recommend Nam and Indochina Voyages to help you organise your trip of a lifetime to Vietnam and South East Asia. What I really loved is that Nam came to meet us which was great after all the emails that went backwards and forwards organising our trip. I will certainly be using Indochina Voyages and Nam again. Thank you so much Nam you truly did make our holiday a trip of a lifetime."

Our main destination is Hanoi, including an overnight cruise package in Halong Bay. Ms. Huyen Nguyen was the contact person for the tour organizing. Having to organize a trip for 20 is pretty challenging as there would be different preferences, many plan changes, which require a lot of communication from both sides of the party. Ms. Huyen had been providing extraordinary amount of attention to the group, replying emails very quickly even on weekends. Although enormous changes has been made since the first day of planning, she managed to kept everything moving until the tour was finalized. Very great service! Thumbs up for her!Our tour guide for the whole trip was Mr. Sinh, and he was very kind, nice, knowledgeable, and also flexible on arranging the tour. He introduced a lot of things about Vietnam and the places we're visiting, while also being very patient with the whole group (yes it's a graduation trip for 20 students). I even felt bad for him because he's just being too nice to the group. He's totally someone you're gonna look for if you're going to walk around the streets of Hanoi. The whole group really enjoyed the trip. From enjoying a very adventurous journey on boats while seeing the breathtaking scenery and going through different caves in Trang An. Crusing through the with kayaks and sunbathing in the sandy beach in the infamous Halong Bay. And last but not least having the best Vietnamese food that can never be found even on any 5-star Vietnamese restaurants around the world. Anyone would never forget the amazing Bun Cha and Pho from the streets of Hanoi. Everything was excellent and great! It was very memorable for all of us, and definitely Indochina Voyages would be the choice for our next trip to Vietnam!"

A couple of my friends and I decided to take a 2 week trip to Vietnam/Cambodia, and as the designated organiser of the trip I spent a good month getting quotes from various travel agencies about guided tours that would allow us to see as much of the two countries as possible... Then I stumbled upon Indochiona Voyages! They were absolutely amazing, right from the beginning. Their quotes were the cheapest I had found, and communication with Quynh Anh was second to none. I literally emailed her 2-3 times a day with questions, and flight plans, etc. and she always answered within a few hours.I felt it was also very lovely that while we were in Hanoi, she made the effort to meet us in person. It was nice putting a face to the person I had been talking to via email for the previous 3-4 months!Our tour guides for the most part were great. We didn't have a problem understanding them, and they seemed to be very knowledgeable. We especially appreciated Tom (our tour guide in Ho Chi Minh) who was adamant that we experience the 'real' Vietnam, and so took us to places that we wouldn't necessarily have found on our own; as well as made us try various specialties. We had a slight problem with our tour guide in Cambodia, who wasn't as amenable to our preferences as those in Vietnam had been, but we communicated the issue to Anh, who did her best to sort it out.The highlight of our trip, at least for me, was definitely Halong Bay. We stayed overnight on a junk ship, which gave us absolutely amazing pictures of the island. We also enjoyed a spot of kayaking and visited the nearby fishing village.Our room on the ship was spacious considering how limited the space is on board and all the staff we're hospitable, seeing to our every need. It was sad leaving them after the 2 days.I would have absolutely no problem recommending Indochina Voyages to anyone thinking about travelling to Asia, and isn't keen to organise everything themselves. They are a definite must for me when I find the time to head to Thailand!"

We spent 7 days in Hanoi on the \"Tonkin Elegance\" private tour package, organised by Ms. Huyen Nguyen of Indochina Voyages. From the beginning of our correspondences to the actual trip, Ms. Huyen was extremely prompt in our communications, answering all my email queries responsively. I requested for accommodations with basic gym facilities, and Ms. Huyen managed to sort that out for me. Logistics were perfect, from the pick ups, hotel & train bookings, visits and transport etc. The drivers and tour guides were friendly, professional and informative. Sapa was an interesting place which we visited, trekking the several villages was an eye-opening experience, with the beautiful lush & green rice terraces. My tour guide in Sapa was Hai. He was a gentleman and took good care of me while we trekked up & down the uneven paths in Ma Tra and Ta Phin villages. The Ta Phin village is surrounded by mountains and beautiful landscapes. We also got to try the local cuisine (pho,banh mi, pillow cakes, viet salad dish) and egg coffee in Old Quarters, Hanoi. It was a pity we missed out on Halong Bay due to unforeseen weather conditions. However, it gives us a reason to visit lovely Hanoi in the near future, we definitely look forward to engage Indochina Voyages services again!"

Our guide for the whole day was Mr. Sinh, who took very good care of us for the duration of the whole trip (which included a boat ride to 8 caves). Mr. Sinh was very kind, patient, and incredibly knowledgeable and told us many interesting facts about Hanoi, Ninh Binh, Trang An, the Binh Dai temple, and Vietnam life in general. Lunch was included in our tour and it was a tasty feast of local Vietnamese food that we thoroughly enjoyed. We appreciate that we never felt rushed, and that Mr. Sinh even explained the food (and how to eat the roll) to us.

Anh was on hand to help when we made last minute plans, even booking train travel between Ninh Binh and Hue and personally delivering the train tickets to our hotel in Hanoi.

After telling Anh a rough idea for an itinerary she worked on a draft for us that ended up being very close to what we ended up doing - she really read our brief well and nailed it! Her email communication was fast and informative, giving us 100% confidence in our arrangements and choice of travel agent. We spent time in Siem Reap, Hoi An, Hanoi with 2-night side trip to Halong Bay on Dragon Legend, and ending in some beach time on Phu Quoc. All of the hotels suggested were excellent and the guides in each city were top notch. Special thanks to guides NaRong, Tri and Phuoc - all showed pride and passion for their respective cities and gave us a great insight into each place during our time with them. The private car transfers were all on time, drivers were safe and always waiting where they said they would be which was appreciated when arriving in a new city. The holiday really didn't cost much more than if we were to book all of the tours, hotels, internal flights and transfers ourselves, and it made it an easy and stress free process for us on our first trip to these 2 countries. If you are thinking about travelling to Cambodia and/or Vietnam but don't know where to start or don't fancy completely independent travel on your first trip, you won't be disappointed with Indochina Voyages and Anh's services. We will definitely use them again on our next trip."

We are an older couple from Scotland who booked an extended holiday to Vietnam and Cambodia through Indochina Voyages, specifically through Nam Lucas our highly competent and enthusiastic agent. Although every aspect of the holiday was excellent, I would make special mention of the wonderful day we spent visiting the Angkor Temples in Cambodia. We were picked up punctually by our friendly and highly knowledgeable guide Nrong and our extremely considerate driver (sorry, I forget his name) and thereafter we spent the most wonderful day you could imagine. It goes without saying that all the temples were magnificent but Angkor Wat, the seventh wonder of the world, was just that \u2013 wondrous! Nrong, ensured that we visited this temple at the right time of day when the light would be best for taking photographs \u2013 we were enthralled! We were then whisked away, late afternoon, we climbed up Phnom Bakheng Hill where we were able to drink in the sunset over the temples, a very spiritual event. By hitting the hill early, we did not have to wait in the extremely long queues as only 300 people at a time are allowed on the hill top. We then had time to freshen up before visiting the Phare Circus, a social project where young, talented street kids are trained in all aspects of the performing arts. OMG, it was excellent, thrilling and exciting \u2013 what a night, one to cherish and remember!From start to finish our day and evening were well organised. It was well paced, giving is time to explore the temples and to take as many photographs as we could. Nrong was always there advising on areas to take good photographs, taking photographs of us as a couple and even advising us on how to take exceptionally good \u2018selfies\u2019. We had a beautiful lunch in a quiet restaurant with plenty of time to recover from the morning\u2019s visits and to set us up for the highlight of the day ANGKOR WAT.I would like to make special mention of our driver in Siem Reap. He was so, so considerate, ensuring that we had ice cold water before we left the car and when we returned, not only water but cool wipes too, he was lovely.Finally, we would have no intention of recommending Indochina Voyages for both day trips and longer holidays. Nam Lucas inspired in us a great deal of confidence bearing in mind we were travelling from Scotland and had not visited Vietnam/Cambodia before. If you\u2019re thinking of visiting this part of the world, be sure to use Indochinavoyages!"

Since the very beginning, Nam helped us to find the perfect route that would fit our likings. We spent two weeks in Vietnam, and a few days in Cambodia and Thailand. Everything was perfect! All the tour guides and drivers were professional, carismatic and helpful. Nam kept contact with us from the office in Hanoi throughtout the entire journey, always making sure everything was running smoothly.For anyone interested in going to that part of the world, I'd highly recommend IndoChina Voyages!"

            "review": "More than day tours. Five week, three country tour.. Based on Trip Advisor, we contacted Indochina Tours from our Canadian home to inquire about a three country private (husband and wife) tour. Tham Tran was assigned to us and she did an excellent job. We went through 7-8 versions of the itinerary so that it matched ours needs and her knowledge. All expectations were met and she was in touch with us by phone and email throughout the entire trip. A couple of weaknesses. 1. The trip was subcontracted outside of Vietnam. Indochina works best in Vietnam where they have full control. 2. Several of the lunch meals were disappointing. We suggest that you allow the guide to take you to a restaurant on route but that you order and pay yourself. Otherwise you get the set menu which is way too much food and may not be of your liking. 3. The guides did not know the high quality restaurants because frankly they can not afford to eat in them. When we used Trip Advisor for advice, we eat some excellent food. Also Tram knew the best places to eat in Hanoi as this is her home city. 4. Suggest that you do as we did and work closely with Tham to select the exact type of hotel you desire. We stayed in very nice three star small hotels.I would recommend a private tour in Vietnam with Indochina Voyages. The problems listed can all be resolved with good planning."

Throughout the tour he was very patient and enthusiastic. Driver was very professional so the erratic driving of other road users was not an issue. Trip included all entry fees, & ample bottled water.Lunch at Y Thao restaurant was a wonderful experience, a highly rated restaurant with excellent service. Chung was more than happy to take us to places that we wished to visit that may not have been on his original itinerary. Our day was completed with a relaxing boat truip down the Perfume River before being returned to our hotel in the late afternoonThe next morning, having checked out of hotel we set off to Hoi An via Hai Van Pass. Chung arranged several stops to admire the stunning views & included a welcome stop for coffee.Arrived in Da Nang & we were then taken on city tour including the amazing tall white Lady Buddah. After a pleasant lunch we visited Marble Mountain & caves. We arrived at Hoi An Hotel mid afternoon. A pleasant aside is that we were not taken to any tourist traps were guide may have had an \u2018interest\u2019 in us making a purchase!The 2 day trip was excellent value & a very enjoyable experience. We have booked for 2 more Indochina Voyages private tours including Mekong River trip.Finally a big thank you to Tham at Indochina Voyages for great e-mail communication & a big thank you to Chung our most excellent guide."

The weather was not ideal- but we enjoyed the scenery, kayaking, visit to cave, and narratives by the crew. Lite fog and clouds gave the amazing 1969 mountains a mysterious appearance. Super photo ops. Food was outstanding and plentiful with a terrific selection of wines. While dinner in the cave was a draw, the cancellation due to weather couldn't be helped. Mr. Chung was a wonderful host/ guide as was the entire crew. My only disappointment was when I realized I'd left my eyeglasses in the returning bus-ugh- but wait- Indochina Voyages finds them and returns them to the hotel the next day.

We are experienced independent travelers, having visited a number of countries and frequently 'going well off the beaten path' to broaden our understanding of places and people.Indochina was a new regional destination for us and we wanted to include Vietnam (the northern areas), Laos, northern Thailand and Luang Prabang, Cambodia. We realized we needed help and we sought our Indochina Voyages after reading a variety of positive reviews on tripadvisor. We also exchanged some emails with former customers of Indochina Voyages to inquire about their specific experiences.As good fortune would have it, we were blessed to make contact with Tham Tran of Indochina Voyages. Over a period of several months, she communicated with us by emails and SKYPE and suggested and discussed an abundance of interesting possibilities, based upon our goals.She helped us focus on travel periods offering the highest probability for pleasant weather conditions as well time frames to experience a number of local festivals along the way.When we finalized our international flight reservations, Tham located and immediately locked in all of our domestic flights, using only the highest rated local airlines (cheap flights by low cost carriers often involve reduced maintenance and inexperienced pilots).Everything looked good on paper, but we would need to wait and see what happened when we actually traveled.We were preparing for the unexpected!When we arrived at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi (after more than 30 hours of transit time), we wondered if the documents Tham had provided us in advance would make our transition through immigrations go smoothly, because we were somewhat tired. While we watched some passengers in front of us experience confusion and delays, our documents were processed efficiently and we were promptly passed through without any delays or difficulties (thanks, Tham). As soon as we claimed our luggage and stepped outside the terminal, there was our airport transfer driver with our names conspicuously displayed (thanks, Tham).During the brief ride to the hotel the driver's cellular phone rang, he answered and handed it to us! What a surprise, it was Tham and she wanted to personally welcome us to Vietnam (thanks, Tham).As we observed many visitors being herded about in large groups aboard tour busses, we instead scurried through traffic on foot and used local taxis with Tham, discovering everyday life and encountering real people....learning a few basic terms in Vietnamese were so important: a feeble \"xin ch\u00e0o\" was always received with a broad smile and often a \"hello\" in return, while an attempt at \"c\u1ea3m \u01a1n b\u1ea1n\" never failed to be acknowledged!One important task was to buy a Ao Dai during our brief time in Hanoi. Tham located a local establishment, specializing in custom made Ao Dais for local residents (we saw no tourists or westerners during our three visits)....we were able to select hand-embroidered silk, and have the fittings completed within three days.In dealing with Tham and Indochina Voyages, the only surprise we received was the extraordinary high level of services and attention to details demonstrated during every phase of our month long Asian adventure.Communications proved to be the key factor leading to our success with Tham and Indochina Voyages. We are contemplating a return to Asia during the upcoming year there is no doubt with whom we will coordinate our travel."

We've used Tuan and his crew at Indochina Voyages in the past for extended tours and to fill in the gaps on self-planned trips, so it was only natural that we would turn to them again to plan some day drips.As usual, everything went off like clockwork. We were picked up from our hotel right on time, with the guides coming into the foyer to meet and greet us rather than us having to wait outside. Vehicles used were modern and immaculate inside and out, and from our experience seemed well maintained. Drivers were careful and focused on our safety: a far cry from the usual bus or taxi driver behavior that's only too noticeable in Hanoi.All the little extras were there: a constant supply of ice cold water, refresher towels whenever needed, useful advice on bargaining or where to get the best products. Guides all spoke excellent English and we never had to repeat ourselves or rephrase a sentence to be understood. And the guides knew their subject intimately, and had no trouble in communicating that knowledge. Without going into trip specifics, we learnt so much more from using this company than we could ever have gleamed from a DIY trip.And we didn't have to worry about any of the detail from the moment we were picked up to the time we were returned to our hotel. They just did all the legwork for you, and went out of their way to make the day memorable. On the fly changes to the itinerary were easily accommodated. All we had to do was express an interest in a particular sight or landmark, and it was done.Over the years we've used Indochina Voyages for longer trips. It was great to see that their simple philosophy of delivering excellent service and value for money was just as evident on their day trips. I guess its a sign of success in Vietnam when you have other companies try to imitate you or use an almost identical company name and webpage to confuse travelers. Indochina Voyages now has these imitators. Obviously none of them have the integrity displayed by the real Indochina Voyages.This is a company that I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending for all journeys, short or long. Just beware of the imitators."

We enjoyed this beautiful part of the world and its people, food and culture thanks to Indochina Voyages. Its hard to pick a single favourite part of the trip but if we had to - the villages and people in the villages outside of Sapa, Hoi An (on bicycles) and the Mekong Delta were amazing with the best guides. Thanks to all of you!"

All our day trips and accommodation was extremely well organised and professional.Probably our best day was on the Meekong. We were picked up by long boat from our accommodation and taken to the floating market and given fresh fruit and coconut. We then went for a walk, visiting family businesses making fish sauce, popping rice, and coconut toffee among many other products. We then visited a 100 year old house and made our own spring rolls, then had an amazing meal cooked before our eyes. Our guides, Hue in the south and Tang in the north were very informative and spoke very good English. Thanks to everyone at Indochina Voyages."

Among heaps of on-line and off-line tour operators I chose Indochina Voyages to organise most of the two-week vacation I and my partner have recently spent in Vietnam... and I was absolutely right as we were surprised by the high-quality standards of the service we received.All worked out very well, from the comfort of the suggested accomodations, to the absolute punctuality of each transfer. Little lack of spoken English among a couple of our assigned tour guides is the only note I can make, but nothing to worry about.Special thanks to Ms. Tham, our tour organiser at Indochina Voyages, who managed to assist us with a very flexible, kind and customer focused approach and found a perfect solution for any customisation request we made.We would certainly recommend Indochina Voyages and we will count on them for our next trips in Indochina."

Nam from Indochina Voyages arranged our visit to Angkor Wat. He arranged a wonderful guide by the name of Tholl (not sure if this spelling is correct?)This guide knew the inside and outside of almost everything at Angkor Wat. We visited the biggest wat first. Our guide explained everything to us. Any questions we had he was able to answer in a confident manner. We only had 1 day to view the wats at Angkor Wat and really wanted to see the Jungle Wat (this is the one you see most often in magazines and tv). It was stunning! The way the jungle has reclaimed this is breathtaking. There is so much to see we easily could have had 3 days here but we were on a time crunch trying to see as much as we could of Cambodia. If you are interested in visiting Angkor Wat please let Nam at Indochina Voyages arrange everything for you. We couldn't have asked for a better guide or a better day."

We chose IV as they got great reviews and our tailored tour seemed a decent price.Correspondence beforehand was fine and gave some good advice on our proposed route. Airport pickups were all efficient and easy to find the guide. The food included as part of the tour (lunch predominantly) was described in the itinerary as basic, and it was very average and obviously the safe option! In hindsight I\u2019d have preferred to just stop for a B\u00e1nh m\u00ec somewhere along the way! The \u2018Royal Dinner\u2019 was pretty disappointing, we assumed this was included because we had a long day out and about but we were back to the hotel well before dinner and as such could have just had a dinner at somewhere of our own choice.Our HCMC guide Tom was far and away our best guide, he was absolutely fantastic! Full of information and also lots about the culture and daily life. Other guides worth a mention were our guides for Mekong Delta and board our junk Boat in B\u00e1i T\u1eed Long Bay.The other guides were OK, but could improve by being more forthcoming with information about the areas/sights etc.Overall, we definitely had a better experience using IV than if we\u2019d tried to do our trip fully independently and would recommend for first-timers wanting to personalise their own itinerary."

We visited a family and tried our hands at making rice paper (wrappers for spring rolls.) There was an opportunity to ride bicycles between a couple of villages, and a very good lunch.

From my arrival in Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi in the north,just loved,saddened,amazed of every minute of it,the people,the food,the sadness,the getting on with it,the futility of a war and the stupidity of it also,the shock and horror of a people subjected to unimaginable cruelty and yet bounding back with what appears forgiveness and optimism. Indochina Voyages,how was I so lucky to find you,every detail,every email,every slight alteration,every tour,every hotel, done to perfection. I was so impressed that on my last two nights I insisted on meeting Minh to thank him for a job well done,you know how you conjure in your mind how a person looks when your dealing with them by correspondence only,Minh to me was an elderly gentleman,bespectacled,studious,you get my drift,well how wrong can you be,quite the opposite,we had a good laugh over that one. Thanks Minh,thanks Vietnam and most of all thanks Indochina Voyages,you were so good I had the confidence to tackle Cambodia and there you were the same,professional and never say die."

Huyen proved to be thorough and efficient, responding promptly to my many emails in the beginning stages and following up my requests. She managed to book all our flights (both international and domestic) at a much more reasonable cost than I could and then co ordinated our three week holiday in Vietnam, booking hotels, airport transfers and any tours I requested. Nothing was too much trouble for her and I have to say during our holiday everything went like clockwork! It was lovely to finally put a face to the name when the lovely Huyen managed to meet up with us briefly during our time in Hanoi.

Our advisor Tham was clear on our needs and built a great itinerary. The trip exceeded our expectations, the whole trip did involve travel across the country using trains, boats, 2 internal flights, tuk tuks and we had guides in most places. The whole process was very slick with people to meet us at the right time and all were very friendly. Our favourite guide was Long is Hoi Ann, very knowledgable and very funny. The hotels that were selected were all 4 star and were all great, particularly the Hanoi La Siesta Trendy, great service and Palm Garden Resort in Hoi Ann, a great beach resort. We also had restaurants for lunch and some dinners selected for us and they were all great, we would probably have not found them ourselves. One of our favourite trips was to the Mekong delta with Halong Bay just behind. Overall we cannot thank Tham and Indochina Voyages for putting together an amazing itinerary."

She not only provided the best customer service but for the first time in booking a holiday I felt completely at ease and not anxious about booking an average attraction or mediocre hotel. Halfway through the trip we needed to make a big change due to my partners illness (we wanted to skip an overnight train and one attraction and travel straight to Hue from Sapa). We thought this would most likely not occur due to only giving Tham 12 hours notice. To our delight she re-arranged our itinerary to our specifications and managed to book us a flight instead of the overnight train.We especially loved the small details; Tham told every restaurant, tour guide and hotel that it was our honeymoon so we felt that extra bit special. Tham also made time out of her busy schedule to meet us for coffee when we touring around Hanoi. Every local restaurant, every attraction, every tour guide was fantastic. Tham didn't let us down in any way. I could not have asked for a better honeymoon!"

Tam was our guide, and the experience was made all the more special because of him. HOT TIP: Our tour was on a Sunday, which meant the traffic in and out of Ho Chi Minh was so much easier.

Tham was very flexible, offered many good suggestions, and handled our visa arrangements. Our trip went from North to South and included urban areas, but also a fascinating visit to a Red Dao village in the far north and a really interesting day-trip to the Mekong Delta, where we visited a number of small businesses and traveled around via bicycles, canoe, and riverboat.During our 17 days in Vietnam we stayed in 7 different lodgings, had 6 guides, and 7 drivers. The guides were fun, quite helpful, and spoke excellent English. The drivers were reliable and safe. Everything ran on time and as planned, without any problems. We felt as though we had a network of people in Vietnam watching out for us. Tham called us several times while we were traveling to make sure everything was going well. We enjoyed our visit immensely, and gained an appreciation for a complex and beautiful country. We hope to return to Southeast Asia and will definitely use the services of Indochina Voyages again."

We only had time for nine days and eight nights in Vietnam and it made sense to use a tour company. We opted for the 'Tonkin Elegance Tour', which gave us four nights in Hanoi, one in Sapa and one on the 24-hour cruise at Halong Bay, plus two nights on an overnight train, which was an enjoyable adventure. Our contact, Ms Huyen Nguyen, was excellent. She answered all our questions very quickly, in a very friendly manner, and in faultless English. She offered us a choice of a three-star tour at $710 per person and 4-star at $875. We chose the latter, and this gave us two nights in Hanoi at each end of the trip in the superb La Siesta hotel in heart of the old district. A small supplement also got us onto the excellent (and apparently best) cruise ship on Halong Bay, the Dragon Legend.The tour was well thought-out and superbly managed. Guides and drivers showed up exactly as scheduled. We had a private car or minibus for all transfers, and a guide to ourselves, which meant we could have interesting and detailed conversations with them. The two overnight train trips from Hanoi to Lao Cai (the train station nearest to Sapa) were rattly but clean, and we enjoyed them. On our last full day we added an optional trip to Ninh Binh province, which made an interesting contrast to eh Vietnames highlands. Our Indochina Voyages contact, Huyen, was very clear about charges and conditions, what was included and what would be extra, and we were extremely happy with the service we received. If we are lucky enough to be able to visit Vietnam again, we won't hesitate to contact the company."

Thumbs up for her!Our tour guide for the whole trip was Mr. Sinh, and he was very kind, nice, knowledgeable, and also flexible on arranging the tour. He introduced a lot of things about Vietnam and the places we're visiting, while also being very patient with the whole group (yes it's a graduation trip for 20 students). I even felt bad for him because he's just being too nice to the group. He's totally someone you're gonna look for if you're going to walk around the streets of Hanoi. The whole group really enjoyed the trip. From enjoying a very adventurous journey on boats while seeing the breathtaking scenery and going through different caves in Trang An. Crusing through the with kayaks and sunbathing in the sandy beach in the infamous Halong Bay. And last but not least having the best Vietnamese food that can never be found even on any 5-star Vietnamese restaurants around the world. Anyone would never forget the amazing Bun Cha and Pho from the streets of Hanoi. Everything was excellent and great! It was very memorable for all of us, and definitely Indochina Voyages would be the choice for our next trip to Vietnam!"

A couple of my friends and I decided to take a 2 week trip to Vietnam/Cambodia, and as the designated organiser of the trip I spent a good month getting quotes from various travel agencies about guided tours that would allow us to see as much of the two countries as possible... Then I stumbled upon Indochiona Voyages! They were absolutely amazing, right from the beginning. Their quotes were the cheapest I had found, and communication with Quynh Anh was second to none. I literally emailed her 2-3 times a day with questions, and flight plans, etc. and she always answered within a few hours.I felt it was also very lovely that while we were in Hanoi, she made the effort to meet us in person. It was nice putting a face to the person I had been talking to via email for the previous 3-4 months!Our tour guides for the most part were great. We didn't have a problem understanding them, and they seemed to be very knowledgeable. We especially appreciated Tom (our tour guide in Ho Chi Minh) who was adamant that we experience the 'real' Vietnam, and so took us to places that we wouldn't necessarily have found on our own; as well as made us try various specialties. We had a slight problem with our tour guide in Cambodia, who wasn't as amenable to our preferences as those in Vietnam had been, but we communicated the issue to Anh, who did her best to sort it out.The highlight of our trip, at least for me, was definitely Halong Bay. We stayed overnight on a junk ship, which gave us absolutely amazing pictures of the island. We also enjoyed a spot of kayaking and visited the nearby fishing village.Our room on the ship was spacious considering how limited the space is on board and all the staff we're hospitable, seeing to our every need. It was sad leaving them after the 2 days.I would have absolutely no problem recommending Indochina Voyages to anyone thinking about travelling to Asia, and isn't keen to organise everything themselves. They are a definite must for me when I find the time to head to Thailand!"

After telling Anh a rough idea for an itinerary she worked on a draft for us that ended up being very close to what we ended up doing - she really read our brief well and nailed it! Her email communication was fast and informative, giving us 100% confidence in our arrangements and choice of travel agent. We spent time in Siem Reap, Hoi An, Hanoi with 2-night side trip to Halong Bay on Dragon Legend, and ending in some beach time on Phu Quoc. All of the hotels suggested were excellent and the guides in each city were top notch. Special thanks to guides NaRong, Tri and Phuoc - all showed pride and passion for their respective cities and gave us a great insight into each place during our time with them. The private car transfers were all on time, drivers were safe and always waiting where they said they would be which was appreciated when arriving in a new city. The holiday really didn't cost much more than if we were to book all of the tours, hotels, internal flights and transfers ourselves, and it made it an easy and stress free process for us on our first trip to these 2 countries. If you are thinking about travelling to Cambodia and/or Vietnam but don't know where to start or don't fancy completely independent travel on your first trip, you won't be disappointed with Indochina Voyages and Anh's services. We will definitely use them again on our next trip."

We are an older couple from Scotland who booked an extended holiday to Vietnam and Cambodia through Indochina Voyages, specifically through Nam Lucas our highly competent and enthusiastic agent. Although every aspect of the holiday was excellent, I would make special mention of the wonderful day we spent visiting the Angkor Temples in Cambodia. We were picked up punctually by our friendly and highly knowledgeable guide Nrong and our extremely considerate driver (sorry, I forget his name) and thereafter we spent the most wonderful day you could imagine. It goes without saying that all the temples were magnificent but Angkor Wat, the seventh wonder of the world, was just that \u2013 wondrous! Nrong, ensured that we visited this temple at the right time of day when the light would be best for taking photographs \u2013 we were enthralled! We were then whisked away, late afternoon, we climbed up Phnom Bakheng Hill where we were able to drink in the sunset over the temples, a very spiritual event. By hitting the hill early, we did not have to wait in the extremely long queues as only 300 people at a time are allowed on the hill top. We then had time to freshen up before visiting the Phare Circus, a social project where young, talented street kids are trained in all aspects of the performing arts. OMG, it was excellent, thrilling and exciting \u2013 what a night, one to cherish and remember!From start to finish our day and evening were well organised. It was well paced, giving is time to explore the temples and to take as many photographs as we could. Nrong was always there advising on areas to take good photographs, taking photographs of us as a couple and even advising us on how to take exceptionally good \u2018selfies\u2019. We had a beautiful lunch in a quiet restaurant with plenty of time to recover from the morning\u2019s visits and to set us up for the highlight of the day ANGKOR WAT.I would like to make special mention of our driver in Siem Reap. He was so, so considerate, ensuring that we had ice cold water before we left the car and when we returned, not only water but cool wipes too, he was lovely.Finally, we would have no intention of recommending Indochina Voyages for both day trips and longer holidays. Nam Lucas inspired in us a great deal of confidence bearing in mind we were travelling from Scotland and had not visited Vietnam/Cambodia before. If you\u2019re thinking of visiting this part of the world, be sure to use Indochinavoyages!"

Based on Trip Advisor, we contacted Indochina Tours from our Canadian home to inquire about a three country private (husband and wife) tour. Tham Tran was assigned to us and she did an excellent job. We went through 7-8 versions of the itinerary so that it matched ours needs and her knowledge. All expectations were met and she was in touch with us by phone and email throughout the entire trip. A couple of weaknesses. 1. The trip was subcontracted outside of Vietnam. Indochina works best in Vietnam where they have full control. 2. Several of the lunch meals were disappointing. We suggest that you allow the guide to take you to a restaurant on route but that you order and pay yourself. Otherwise you get the set menu which is way too much food and may not be of your liking. 3. The guides did not know the high quality restaurants because frankly they can not afford to eat in them. When we used Trip Advisor for advice, we eat some excellent food. Also Tram knew the best places to eat in Hanoi as this is her home city. 4. Suggest that you do as we did and work closely with Tham to select the exact type of hotel you desire. We stayed in very nice three star small hotels.I would recommend a private tour in Vietnam with Indochina Voyages. The problems listed can all be resolved with good planning."

Not only did it exceed our expectations, we made friends with our hosts, guides, drivers and the local people we were introduced to. Quyan Anh was our agent and I cannot explain how amazing she was. She adjusted some of the itinerary so it better fit our group and was always available via email before our trip to make sure we were well taken care of. I would HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone wanting a fantastic tour of Thailand!Thank you"

            "review": "Effective Communications Brought Total Success. We are experienced independent travelers, having visited a number of countries and frequently 'going well off the beaten path' to broaden our understanding of places and people.Indochina was a new regional destination for us and we wanted to include Vietnam (the northern areas), Laos, northern Thailand and Luang Prabang, Cambodia. We realized we needed help and we sought our Indochina Voyages after reading a variety of positive reviews on tripadvisor. We also exchanged some emails with former customers of Indochina Voyages to inquire about their specific experiences.As good fortune would have it, we were blessed to make contact with Tham Tran of Indochina Voyages. Over a period of several months, she communicated with us by emails and SKYPE and suggested and discussed an abundance of interesting possibilities, based upon our goals.She helped us focus on travel periods offering the highest probability for pleasant weather conditions as well time frames to experience a number of local festivals along the way.When we finalized our international flight reservations, Tham located and immediately locked in all of our domestic flights, using only the highest rated local airlines (cheap flights by low cost carriers often involve reduced maintenance and inexperienced pilots).Everything looked good on paper, but we would need to wait and see what happened when we actually traveled.We were preparing for the unexpected!When we arrived at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi (after more than 30 hours of transit time), we wondered if the documents Tham had provided us in advance would make our transition through immigrations go smoothly, because we were somewhat tired. While we watched some passengers in front of us experience confusion and delays, our documents were processed efficiently and we were promptly passed through without any delays or difficulties (thanks, Tham). As soon as we claimed our luggage and stepped outside the terminal, there was our airport transfer driver with our names conspicuously displayed (thanks, Tham).During the brief ride to the hotel the driver's cellular phone rang, he answered and handed it to us! What a surprise, it was Tham and she wanted to personally welcome us to Vietnam (thanks, Tham).As we observed many visitors being herded about in large groups aboard tour busses, we instead scurried through traffic on foot and used local taxis with Tham, discovering everyday life and encountering real people....learning a few basic terms in Vietnamese were so important: a feeble \"xin ch\u00e0o\" was always received with a broad smile and often a \"hello\" in return, while an attempt at \"c\u1ea3m \u01a1n b\u1ea1n\" never failed to be acknowledged!One important task was to buy a Ao Dai during our brief time in Hanoi. Tham located a local establishment, specializing in custom made Ao Dais for local residents (we saw no tourists or westerners during our three visits)....we were able to select hand-embroidered silk, and have the fittings completed within three days.In dealing with Tham and Indochina Voyages, the only surprise we received was the extraordinary high level of services and attention to details demonstrated during every phase of our month long Asian adventure.Communications proved to be the key factor leading to our success with Tham and Indochina Voyages. We are contemplating a return to Asia during the upcoming year there is no doubt with whom we will coordinate our travel."

We've used Tuan and his crew at Indochina Voyages in the past for extended tours and to fill in the gaps on self-planned trips, so it was only natural that we would turn to them again to plan some day drips.As usual, everything went off like clockwork. We were picked up from our hotel right on time, with the guides coming into the foyer to meet and greet us rather than us having to wait outside. Vehicles used were modern and immaculate inside and out, and from our experience seemed well maintained. Drivers were careful and focused on our safety: a far cry from the usual bus or taxi driver behavior that's only too noticeable in Hanoi.All the little extras were there: a constant supply of ice cold water, refresher towels whenever needed, useful advice on bargaining or where to get the best products. Guides all spoke excellent English and we never had to repeat ourselves or rephrase a sentence to be understood. And the guides knew their subject intimately, and had no trouble in communicating that knowledge. Without going into trip specifics, we learnt so much more from using this company than we could ever have gleamed from a DIY trip.And we didn't have to worry about any of the detail from the moment we were picked up to the time we were returned to our hotel. They just did all the legwork for you, and went out of their way to make the day memorable. On the fly changes to the itinerary were easily accommodated. All we had to do was express an interest in a particular sight or landmark, and it was done.Over the years we've used Indochina Voyages for longer trips. It was great to see that their simple philosophy of delivering excellent service and value for money was just as evident on their day trips. I guess its a sign of success in Vietnam when you have other companies try to imitate you or use an almost identical company name and webpage to confuse travelers. Indochina Voyages now has these imitators. Obviously none of them have the integrity displayed by the real Indochina Voyages.This is a company that I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending for all journeys, short or long. Just beware of the imitators."

Our guide explained everything to us. Any questions we had he was able to answer in a confident manner. We only had 1 day to view the wats at Angkor Wat and really wanted to see the Jungle Wat (this is the one you see most often in magazines and tv). It was stunning! The way the jungle has reclaimed this is breathtaking. There is so much to see we easily could have had 3 days here but we were on a time crunch trying to see as much as we could of Cambodia.

The \u2018Royal Dinner\u2019 was pretty disappointing, we assumed this was included because we had a long day out and about but we were back to the hotel well before dinner and as such could have just had a dinner at somewhere of our own choice.Our HCMC guide Tom was far and away our best guide, he was absolutely fantastic! Full of information and also lots about the culture and daily life. Other guides worth a mention were our guides for Mekong Delta and board our junk Boat in B\u00e1i T\u1eed Long Bay.The other guides were OK, but could improve by being more forthcoming with information about the areas/sights etc.Overall, we definitely had a better experience using IV than if we\u2019d tried to do our trip fully independently and would recommend for first-timers wanting to personalise their own itinerary."

After lunch we were taken to a bigger mountain village with amazing views of rice terraces, after a two hour walk down the mountain and along the track which was not to hard on unfit person in myself we were picked up and taken back to our hotel. was a great day out and many thanks to Tham Tran and there hard working team for making it one of the great days in Vietnam for us"

We decided to take another day trip to Trang An after a very pleasant city tour the previous day - this is an impromptu decision by the group of 6 of us after a good city tour experience. The female guide whom i cannot pronounce her name was a very cordial, friendly & knowledagble guide. We were happy with the suggestion of the trip to Trang An to filled up our day which we had no plan earlier. It was such an aw inspiring sight with the pleasant boat ride. Lunch was excellent as we had requested for a restaurant for the locals rather for the tourist. Driver was very responsible and we feel safe with his driving and happy that quite a new and clean car was provided. Our faith in Indochina Voyages is always justified, this is my 6 trips with them since 2010."

She communicated quickly and efficiently, and planned a beautiful day tour of Hanoi. Our guide, picked by Qunyh Anh, had a wonderful sense of humor and very good English. The cooking class Anh picked was amazing. She knew it was my birthday, and I was surprised and amazed to have a cake and candles at the end of the class! Her recommendation for a boutique hotel was just excellent. The next time I go to Southeast Asia, I'd call Qunyh Anh in a heartbeat!

They accommodated our changes without any problems, and remained professional and helpful throughout, offering advice when asked and never pushing their own ideas. We had to cancel our trip the day before we left, and wrote of our quite substantial deposit as just our bad luck. I did not contact Indochina at all about this but a few weeks after the cancellation we had a note from them saying that they were holding our deposit. And asking what we wanted to do with it. We got almost the entire deposit back. I cannot see where they deducted much, if anything, for the extensive services, including reservations and travel bookings, that they had undertaken. The unexpected return of our money was a pleasant surprise, but far more impressive was the grace, charm and efficiency with which they did everything. When we resume our plans to go to Vietnam, I would not dream of using anyone else."

This meant that we enjoyed a very high level of personalised service, and although in destinations such as Ho Chi Minh we were booked into group tours, in Hue and Hanoi we had our own dedicated guide. In Hanoi we also met the lovely Ms Loan in person, who despite it being a Sunday afternoon, took the time to come to our hotel to wish us a pleasant stay armed with mementos from Vietnam as gifts!During the tour, when we had a query Ms Loan responded quickly and when my husband left his reading glasses on a bus, she tracked them and ensured their return.With limited time to explore the country, Vietlongs careful planning and local knowledge meant that our stay was packed with highlights. In fact looking back at our photos, it doesn't seem possible to have seen and done so much in the time!Before we booked we compared the itinerary on offer with similar UK operators, and found Vietlong to be extremely competitive on price.We were so impressed that will be using Vietlong to arrange a trip to Camodia & Laos next year.So in summary, if you want to make the most of your precious holiday time and hard earnt money, then Vietlong is the 'go to' tour company."

In the humidity of a Vietnam summer riding a bike is the only way to avoid constant sweating due to the cool air in your face when you ride. We did two 1 day tours but we wish we'd done a lot more!We hired 3 automatic bikes. We'd never ridden any mopeds before but they were really easy to ride and lots of fun. No problems with bikes, good condition etc. So don't worry about that.For My Son Tour, the roads are mostly quiet and the scenery is good. The temples are good too. Putting bikes on a rickety wooden river boat crossing was pretty cool. Would recommend.For Hanoi to Hue via Da Nang, the views are epic as you climb the mountain pass. There's a bit more main road riding on this tour than My Son but it's not scary and still get good views along the way. There's a stopping point at an outdoor swimming park, it's like a river flowing down a cliff that's been converted. A bit touristy but food great, swimming nice and would have been a natural wonder before it got touristy.Lots of good stopping points on both routes with good food/drinks and views. Our guide was cool too, ex Lieutenant in the army.All three of us enjoyed it a lot and came away wishing we'd put more biking in to our itinerary."

This tour was a custom tour as we wanted a few days rest here and there throughout the adventure. We had 2 days in Sapa and 2 Days in Ba Be Park.The tour guides were amazing. They were helpful and polite and made us feel comfortable, they even picked up on some Aussie humor and starting to give it back to us, which was good to see. The route chosen by the company was perfect, with a good mix of everything from highways, dirt roads, home stays, beautiful scenery, off road trails, stops at villages and even the odd waterfall swim.The booking process by emails was fairly smooth and seemed to work ok.The whole tour was really good and would recommend anyone wanting to ride and experience the real Vietnam to jump on board with Vietlong. However, as a seasoned traveler there are a couple of things that need to be said bearing in mind that the whole experience is fantastic, and we have traveled to Vietnam 2 years ago and rode with a different company which was also good, but one needs to be honest with other potential travelers:1) The XR250 bikes that we paid a higher price for (even though 2 of the 7 were 175cc) were pretty flogged out and needed some immediate work. Shocks, clutch and tyres were all in need of replacement as a minimum. That said, we did not expect new bikes, but we did expect better considering the price per person paid.2) As mentioned above, the guides were fantastic, but the 2 we had were not trained in any type of first aid (Vietlongs responsibility not the individaul). And as it happened there was a medical emergency along the way that could have been disastrous had the other members of our group had not had training and own medication (including the \"green whistle for pain relief). Even though the 2 guides did everything they could to help, but really could only be used as translators in that situation. And because we were off the tourist route, hospitals and doctors are very limited and when found, very basic.Other then the 2 points mentioned above (which is why they are \"very good\" and not \"excellent\"), I would recommend this tour company. Would I use these guys again? Yes of course it was a fantastic trip."

Floating villages were also good as was the cruise - very relaxing and with only 20 passengers on board it felt very intimate and personal. The chef who only looked in his early 20ies coped marvellously with 5 vegetarians, 3 of whom did eat egg either, first class food.

We upgraded both flights (to Deluxe Economy) and hotels from the basic package. The tour guides were excellent, both knowledgeable on the area and helpful in general.They take customer satisfaction very seriously. Expect a visit on the last evening from a VietLong representative to ask for impressions and any suggestions for improving the experience. FlightsThis was a first time experience with Vietnam Airlines and there are some pretty awful reviews of them. This may have been the situation in the past but this experience was of a friendly and efficient cabin crew that made both going and returning a pleasure. Internal flights are all basic economy class but then they only last an hour or so. The flights from/to LHR (in Deluxe Economy), were some of the best ever taken, easily outclassing Virgin.One gripe only, it\u2019s impossible to make the VN Airlines online check in system work. It crashes both in the UK and Vietnam. Turn up early to get the right seats.MoneyCambodia primarily uses the American dollar. Everything is priced in dollars and the only time local currency (Real) is seen is when change is less than one dollar.Vietnam still uses the Dong but there are plenty of places where the dollar is happily accepted (Hotel bills are quoted in either).The days of a three course meals with a bottle of wine for \u00a35 are gone. Granted it\u2019s still cheaper than the UK but inflation has hit the area. Although it\u2019s still possible to have a cheap meal in a backpacker restaurant a really good steak dinner, for two, in Saigon can cost VND1.60m, about \u00a350/$71. Good old credit card.Don\u2019t however assume that dollars are accepted everywhere. At least one restaurant didn\u2019t accept them and paying with a credit card was a nightmare. Best to check before ordering.Credit cards are accepted fairly widely but again don\u2019t assume it. ATMs are also fairly widely available but will always deliver the largest denomination notes possible. Request VND50,000 and you\u2019ll get a VND50,000 note, which you then have to get changed.GeneralMarch is one of the hottest times in Cambodia/South Vietnam with temperatures around 38c + humidity. Only Hanoi was cooler at around 21c. The main form of transport in Hanoi and Saigon (Ho Chi Minh) is the moped/scooter and crossing the road is truly frightening. Try and find a crossing, then, when the traffic eases off walk slowly and carefully across the road. Don\u2019t run or make any sudden moves. The traffic will flow around you but watch out in both directions and look out for the occasional speed king."

From the moment we arrived at HCMC airport until our departure from Hanoi everything ran smoothly and the whole trip was well organised and administered. We started off with 2 nights in HCMC (incl a city tour and Cu Chi tunnels), 4 nights in Hoi An (we travelled to My Son and Am Bang beach independently), 1 night on the the train (spectacular views), and 3 nights in Hanoi (incl a city tour, water puppet show and Ha Long bay trip). If we ever return to Vietnam which we hope to do then we won't hesitate to make arrangements via Viet Long. Brilliant!"

Arrival at airports was so smooth. There was always a driver and guide waiting for you. Every hotel was 5* staff , room & food. The guide would explain exactly what was going to happen at each city and give times and agency's. Nothing was too much trouble. We had a 12 day tour which was hectic but have us an insight into Cambodia & Vietnam. We would of liked more time in Saigon as we didn't have time to visit the Killing Fields or The Royal Palace & Silver Pagoda. There would be a very long list of everything we did do but it was all fantastic. 10/10. Would highly recommend Vietlong Travel."

Completed a 7day 1200km loop from Hanoi and can not say enough about the trip and Vietlong travel.Firstly the online service was excellent and Mr Minh answered all of my questions about tour options and pricing. It was this prompt service which made me choose them over other companies. Everything was well organised and ran to plan.Guide. Quynh my guide was fantastic and can't praise him enough for showing me around his country and sharing his knowledge. It was a perfect blend of being looked after but also being challenged on some of the lesser known roads that he showed me. It was these little side roads and adventures that were the highlight of my trip. BTW, do not take this trip with any company if you are new to riding as you really need a medium to above average skill level to keep yourself and others safe while still enjoying yourself.Accomodation was first rate and really enjoyed the homestays and meeting the families and other travellers, didn't mind a bit of the ole rice wine either. The hotels were good and I was always comfortable.The equipment. The XR 250 I hired was great, she had a few kays but I went over everything before we left Hanoi and everything had obviouly been greased and serviced, brakes, tyres and lights all top condition. Old Red never cave me a lick of trouble and performed faultlessly. Quynh gave me a helmet but the rest of the gear I took myself. Should say that you should pack for everything as temps ranged from 2 deg to 27 deg and had sunshine, rain, fog, cloud. Quynh even took me to a local market on the 3rd day to buy rubber washing up gloves and we taped plastic bags to our feet to keep dry. Kept us comfortable in the saddle.Food was great on tour and had everything from street food to home cooked meals. You won't go hungry.So in summary the trip was excellent but the star of the show is Vietnam itself. The scenery between Ha Giang, Dong Van and Ba Be lake is amonst the best in the world and I have seen some pretty amazing places after 20 years of overseas travel. If you love motorcycles and riding the roads here are exceptional and their are more hairpins, crests, sweepers, climbs and descents than you can handle.So stop thinking about it and just do it!"

When in Saigon we visited the ChiChi tunnels, and was good to be in the shade and we paid an extra amount to return to Saigon on the riverboat which was quicker and more interesting than the coach back. Very impressed with all the staff at Vietlong Travel. We cancelled the last days walking tour because we just wanted to chill . Enjoyed the foot massage arranged by Citrus.

Everything, and I mean everything, ran like clockwork. We were met after our flight in Siem Reap by a driver and guide who had patiently waited for us. We were delayed with having to arrange and pay for a visa at the airport. They were both extremely pleasant and not put out at all by the delay. They took us to our hotel in Siem Reap and spent time with us at the hotel making sure we understood all the arrangements that they were making for us. The hotel was very comfortable and clean with very attentive staff. It was the Villa Medamrei Hotel. The following days we were met by the guide and taken by private limousine to the Angkor Wat temples. That evening the guide arranged for us to attend a Chinese buffet and folk dancing dropping us off and picking us up when the show ended. We then went on a boat trip on the Tonle Sap Lake the following morning. Everything was well arranged and we had a boat to ourselves. After lunch at a nice restaurant we were taken on a tour of the city. The following morning we were again picked up by the guide and taken to the bus station where we boarded a bus for the journey to Phnom Penn. We were met by a different guide who advised us of various options of things to do in Phnom Penh. The hotel we stayed in was the Silver River Hotel which was very comfortable. We hired a tuk-tuk and were taken to the killing fields, a Cambodian prison camp and temples and palaces. On day six we were picked up by the guide and car and taken to the bus station where we were driven aboard a luxury coach to Saigon. On arrival we were met by a driver and guide and taken to the Signature Saigon Hotel. The staff were very nice and nothing was too much trouble. The guide and driver picked us up the following day and took us to the cu chi tunnels and then a tour of Saigon. The guide was very knowledgeable and very entertaining. Day 8 we were driven to the airport and flew to Hanoi where we were met by a guide and driver. That evening we went to a water puppet show. The following day the guide arrived at the hotel and we went on a walking tour of Hanoi visiting nearly all the places of interest. We were booked into the Essence d'Orient Hotel in the heart of the old town. Day 9 we were picked up at the hotel and driven to Halong Bay where we boarded the Flamingo, a very comfortable wooden ship. The weather was not very good but we still had a fabulous time and very good food on board. We stayed overnight and after a leisurely morning were again transferred to Hanoi and the essence d'orient Hotel. This hotel was superb with fantastic staff and excellent food. We then spent two days at leisure in Hanoi. On the last day we were collected by the guide and driver and taken to the airport. The guide accompanied us to the check in and stayed with us until we went through to the departure gates. He made sure everything went well and we were happy before he left us. This was the best organised holiday we have ever been on and everybody we met was extremely friendly and accommodating. The guides all spoke excellent English and gave us lots of tips of what to do and where to go in our free time. Highly recommended throughout."

Thanks for an amazing two day Mekong Motorbike tour.The arrangement of the tour by VietLong Travel (Minh Hoang) was seamless in every way. You knew it was going to be perfect with the ease of booking, loads of confirmations and answers to any and every question.Our fantastic guide KC (Thanh Cong) worked us out really quickly and customised the tour along the way. He caught on pretty quickly that our interest was in getting off the beaten track a little, eating food (and having a few beers), and getting in amongst it rather than do some of the more tourist things.Lots of random stops along the way at some pretty cool places.KC kept us safe at all times and made sure we were immersed in all the local stuff as well as some of the more touristy things! His knowledge and narrative kept us informed.We rode down some amazing little tracks & pathways, had random stops for food at peoples houses (fresh caught Mekong prawns and fish was a highlight), experienced some unforgettable scenery and had many laughs along the way!We started at 8:00am on day 1 and arrived at the home stay around 5:30pm.Hong Thai Homestay was just awesome. The dinner was incredible (too much food to describe here, but lot's of it and some sensational fresh fruit that you couldn't resist!!), the beer was ice cold and the hammocks a welcome relief to our bums after a day in the saddle! Mr Thai even procured some of the local banana wine for a nightcap (or two).OK, the bed isn't a 5 star hotel bed, but if that is ALL you are looking for, then perhaps this tour isn't for you! Breakfast was Pho (amazing), Baguette with egg and heaps of fresh fruits. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g737085-d5884762-Reviews-Hong_Thai_Homestay-Ben_Tre_Ben_Tre_Province_Mekong_Delta.htmlDay 2 of the trip started at around 8:00am and was just as leisurely, informative and fun as day 1 but all too soon we found ourselves back in Ho Chi Minh at around 5:00pm.I would do it again tomorrow if I could. An incredible two days travelling on Highways to dirt tracks....next time it will be longer!There were three of us on the trip plus our awesome guide, KC!Perfect - there is nothing negative that I could say about the trip!!"

The guide was funny, very attentive to us, and overall he would have 5 stars. The lunches were ok, not very expensive. The lodging was a home stay, kind of rustic, no AC, but a fan. The meals at home stay were great. The views in country side were the best. Little streets and many paths. The hardest part of trip is riding in Siagon.

Travelled to Phnom Penh by bus (took 6 hours) visited National Museum, Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda, Genocide Museum and the Killing Field of Choeung Ek. Travelled to Ho Chi Minh City by bus (took 8 hours) visited Cu Chi Tunnels, Reunification Palace, War Remnant Museum, etc. Ben Thanh Market is amazing - only issue is most of the stalls are very similar.Flew to Hanoi - travelled to Halong Bay by bus (4 hour trip). One night Cruise was really nice and we were lucky to have great weather. On our return did a walking tour visiting the Ho Chi Minh Complex, One Pillar Pagoda, Temple of Literature, Water Puppet show, etc.We felt the trip was really well organised to fit as much as possible in to the time we were in each city. The price of the tour was really good compared to other tours we looked at doing, with the bonus of a private tour guide at each stop. The only thing we would suggest is look at paying the extra for a flight to avoid the long bus trips. All questions asked by us in emails prior to the trip were met with a very punctual reply.Vietlong Travel organised a fantastic holiday for us and we would recommend them to anyone travelling to this area of the world. All accommodation was centrally located so we walked everywhere and although we stayed at 3 Star Hotels we couldn't fault the standard of service we received. All our guides were excellent."

In all cases they were local guides with excellent local knowledge and all of the days were very interesting and varied. In all cases the driver was careful and the transport very comfortable. We would highly recommend this way of travelling."

VietLong Travel was very helpful in organising and setting up a 7 day motorbike tour for me. They were extremely quick to respond and were very friendly and willing to go above and beyond to make sure my tour was exactly what I wanted. The guide they set me up with, Quang, was professional and someone I now consider a friend for life. Thank you VietLong Travel for all the help. Would recommend for anyone wanting to experience the real Vietnam!"

We had selected a two day tour from Hue to Hoi An with a small company but found that insurance companies would only provide cover if we had a written contract (not offered by the first company). After a bit more research we found that Vietlong Travel and their Vietnam-motorbike Tours offered the very same tour and would provide not only the necessary safety equipment but also the paperwork required by our insurance company.Mr Minh at Vietlong was excellent to deal with and extremely responsive to our questions while we were making arrangements. he was also very flexible in arranging to come to our hotel in Hanoi to receive our final payment. Three of us rode ourselves and my wife went pillion. Our guide, Quang, was excellent, taking us to a variety of 'non-touristy' places from hot springs, to bee farms, homes where rice wine was being made, and local eateries. We only met one other English-speaking tourist in the whole two days, and that was someone working their way through Vietnam.Quang knew a lot about the Ho Chi Minh Trail and the entire region we rode through, and spoke really good English. Best of all he, rode at a really safe speed wherever we went (which was great, given two of us were not overly experienced.All food and drink, including the occasional local bia, was all covered in the cost.The experience was definitely five star. Just be prepared - you get on the bike and 20 seconds later you are riding in traffic Vietnam style!!"

We needed to get to Huay Xai for the Gibbon Experience in Laos, and straight down to Luang Prabang for the Kuang Si waterfalls after due to time constrictions. I emailed Vietlong travel after a recommendation from a friend, and they were amazing. Speedy responses, reasonable prices for a private driver (especially when we actually did the journey! It was horrendous and our driver drove for 11hours on roads that were barely roads driving around the side of mountain after mountain in the dark for most of the way, poor guy! He only stopped for us to go to the loo and buy food! And kept checking we were ok despite not speaking any English!) and easy payment. We also used a driver in Cambodia for the 3 hour drive to the airport. Really, really would recommend them!"

I and my family did take a 2 day trip that is being run by Viet Long Travel \u2013 owner of the cruise. Actually we were confused amongst tens of cruises in Halong, then I searched budget cruise and I found Royal Heritage Cruise. We booked this trip through its website and we enjoyed it.The cruise\u2019s pictures are quite the same as shown on site and right after getting on the boat we had lunch. Amazingly, the food was fantastic with almost fresh seafood! My mother doesn\u2019t eat meat but she was arranged vegetarian dishes instead and of course, she was so happy with that flexible offer. We had 2 rooms next door that were around 14m2. The bathroom was clean and quite nice, the rooms were comfortable with a big enough window so that I was really excited with looking out the scenery from bed.One more thing I would like to share that our guide on cruise was so cool, Quyet, he told us useful infos about Halong and many funny stories that now we do remember, so coolll!!In short, it was my good experience. I do recommend this cruise and wish come back to Vietnam soon and enjoy Halong Bay again with Vietlong Company."

            "review": "Amazing Service - Highly Recommended. This review is supposedly for Vietlong private day tours but I am actually reviewing a total holiday arranged by Vietlong travel.I applied directly to Vietlong Travel for their best Vietnam and Cambodia two week tour and then arranged my international flights myself. I would highly recommend this to anybody travelling to Vietnam as involving a UK travel agent just incurs far more cost which is totally unnecessary as Vietlong Travel are quite capable of dealing with absolutely everything as long as you can book your own flights to Vietnam (so easy - we went Thai airways).I cannot praise this company too much as for us they planned and arranged a superb trip to Vietnam and Cambodia. They dealt with absolutely everything including providing the necessary documentation to get your visas on arrival in Vietnam rather than the pain of having to apply first to the embassy in the UK.Our trip was complex and involved many locations, hotels, tours and internal flights yet everything went like clockwork.We flew to Ho Chi Minh city (still Saigon to the locals) and were met at the airport by our friendly Vietlong guide who accompanied us to our hotel and took care of the checkin. The next day we were picked up at the hotel for private guided tours of the city and to the Chu Chi Tunnels (used by vietcong in the war - very interesting).We were then picked up and taken to the airport to fly to Cambodia. On arrival in Siem Reap we were again met at the airport by a friendly guide who took us to our great hotel and again handled the checkin. Next day we were picked up in the morning and taken on a private day tour of the amazing Angkor Wat complex by our very helpful guide.From Cambodia we flew back to Da Nang and were again met and transported to the wonderful Hoi An Riverside Resort where we spent a few amazing days.We were then picked up again and transported to the airport to fly to Hanoi. Again picked up and taken to a great hotel to stay one night. We were then picked up to transfer to an overnight cruise to Ha Long bay on Heritage Cruises (a partner of Vietlong) - absolutely stunning!Then back to Hanoi in the same hotel and had a guided tour if the city, a massage in the spa and an evening at the water puppet theatre - all included!I cannot describe all of these experiences here and will do so individually on separate reviews. What I want to say here is that I have to recommend VietLong tours for an incredibly well planned holiday, where they chose excellent hotels, arranged interesting tours and made it all run so smoothly that we never had any worries at all.On our very last day the Vietlong representative in Hanoi even came to visit us in our hotel to get feedback and give us some nice gifts - this was a very nice touch which along with everything else just goes to show that this is a company that really cares that their clients have a good time.From day one when I booked and could converse with the Vietlong staff on skype to the very end I felt like we were really being looked after.I would very highly recommend this company to anybody visiting Vietnam. They have many other tour plans to offer as well as the one we took. Just look at their website (vietlongtravel.com) and feel secure in the fact that whatever you choose they will do their very best to ensure that you enjoy every minute without any snags.Most highly recommended."

Our friends used outstanding services from this agent in Mar and that is why we trusted. At the very start, Loan performed to be a very experienced travel expert advising us so many worthy things about the trip and she was also very patient to email back & forth so many questions from us. She got all services confirmed very quickly and guided us to deposit to secure the trip to professioonally. We began the trip from Hanoi & our first tour guide welcoming us at the airport is Mr. Tien who is guide young but speaking English so well and highly educated. He knows so many things about the politics, ongoing world issues, history... shared with us about the war in Vietnam, the relations between Vietnam and US... etc. We are also fond of the overnight trip to Bhaya cruise in Halong Bay which is really a 4-star luxury hotel floating on water, our kids got a real surprise with all kinds of foods and loved kayaking around the islands. We then flew to Da Nang - Hoi An for a truly beach vacation. We stayed at Hoi An Boutique hotel right on the beach side & it looks so fantastic. During the time here, we joined with some other tourists to hand on a cooking class at Tra Que village and learned to be farmers. And through this cooking class, we had a chance to know more about the culinary culture of Vietnam and taste very delicious local foods. thanks to the instructions from our tour guide, We all were especially so moved when coming to visit the disable children in the suburb of Hoi An who are mostly victims of Agent Orange left behind the war. We wished there would not be any war on earth.We said good-bye to Hoi An after 4 nights to go to Saigon and Mekong Delta where is the South of Vietnam. We all do love visiting orchards in Vinh Long on small sampans and tried local fruits here. There are too many special things awaiting for your explorations in Vietnam and for sure, we'll return this land one day"

Honestly we sent our tour inquiries to some different travel agents but surprisingly Mr. Dong from Viet Long is the first person responding to our email. He answered some our questions very clearly and informatively then built up a very interesting trip covering almost highlights of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia for 18 days. Comparing the price with other agents, factually Mr. Dong's price is just a bit higher than other's but all hotels suggested by him is much more reliable & highly guaranteed because they all are in the top 20 of highest ranking hotels and here is also the reason we chose him to book with. Our tour was taken place in the end of May and amazingly he often called us to cross-check the services to ensure that we were enjoying the trip. We especially loved the resort and the cruise in Halong Bay because of the location and outstanding in-door facilities and the attitudes of staffs and we also do like cooking classes in Hoi An where we joined with other tourists to learn cooking traditional Vietnamese cuisines and enjoyed together. We can not speak out all our sweet memories about this trip and we personally respect and appreciate all the team of Vietlong did for us because we perceived that you put your heart in work. We'll surely return South East to explore Myanmar & Philippine next time and use Vietlong again."

First for all, let me say \"thank you\" Mr. Dong for your professional & efficient working manners as well as your cares for our trip from the start till the end. Everything is truly amazing & exactly what we planned. We're not used to posting up comments on such a tripadvisor but this time we break our traditional practices. We heard about Viet Long Travel through our friend's recommendations who did buy a tour from this company in 2014. We emailed to Mr. Dong to customize a tour which might fit our personal desires and incredibly he responded to us so quickly with some travel plans and ideal consultations. We started up our tour from Saigon then flew over Siemreap for Angkor Wat and flew to Da Nang - Hoi An for 5 nights of beach relaxation before going to Hanoi and Halong Bay. All hotels chosen by Mr. Dong have a very high ranking on Tripadvisor and centrally located. When we were on tour, sometimes Mr. Dong called us to cross-check the services as well as tour, satisfactions and he really got mark 10 from us for the night on cruise in Halong Bay. He secretly arranged a birthday party for my wife on cruise with candles, roses, cakes and big bottle of wine even though we did not tell him previously. My wife was so moved with the kind arrangements from Mr. Dong and all his team. By the end of the tour in Hanoi, he bought us a very delicious dinner at a very nice Quan Ngon restaurant under the French styles and dedicated a very precious lacquer painting about the countrysides of Vietnam. By the way, his tour guides in both Vietnam & Cambodia are also professional and speaking English well and knowledgable.Here is really our dream tour and once again thanks Mr. Dong for treating us like a King and Queen and surely we'll use this company again and tell my friends about Viet Long."

The advertised trip was 12 nights but we stayed an extra night in Siem Reap and another in Hanoi. We were slightly concerned before we booked as to whether we would be with a group of people (which we didn't want) but everything was arranged so we were on our own. Everything worked like clockwork with pick ups and hotels and all the guides were great. None of the hotels could be described as luxury but they were all safe, clean and well located. Some tips for you:Siem Reap - hire a car and driver rather than a guide to explore the Angkor complex. The tuks tuks looked fun but we really benefitted from an air conditioned car. My favourite temple was Banteay Srei which is around 35KM from Siem Reap; very small but beautiful and different to the other temples we visited.The bus journeys between Siem Reap and Phnom Pehn, and Phnom Pehn and Ho Chi Mihn City are long and uncomfortable. The roads are rough and its like spending 7 hours in a washing machine on spin cycle! although you just have to grin and bear it.Phnom Pehn - the sunset cruise on the river was fun (this was not part of the itinerary but we just picked up a leaflet in the hotel). The killing fields and S21 are harrowing but we felt that we had to visit them. Our guide was great. Ho Chi Mihn City - The Bitexco tower is well worth a visit. We went to the bar and had a beer whilst admiring the view of the city at night. The tour of the C\u1ee7 Chi tunnels was good, again, with a great guide.Halong City - not much to do here but it is just an overnight stay before the Halong Bay cruise. There was a swimming pool at the hotel which was good.Halong Bay Cruise - Brilliant!! So much packed into 24 hours, one of the highlights of the trip.Hanoi - Really enjoyed Hanoi, crazy but very atmospheric. Glad we spent an extra night here. I recommend visiting the Citadel and the underground bunkers which played a part during the American war.Overall a fantastic trip: great guides, hotels and well organised."

They were very flexible when we wanted to change details from the original package offered which was flying with Qatar Airways via Doha and just a day trip to Halong Bay. We wanted to fly direct with Vietnam Airlines and change the Halong Bay trip to an overnight cruise (highly recommended) and Citrus were happy to change this. Once in Vietnam we were looked after very well by Vietlong Travel and all of our transfers were well organised by the very helpful and friendly reps. If you are thinking of travelling to Vietnam then I would not hesitate to recommend Citrus and Vietlong Travel"

This was the first time we had traveled with Citrus Holidays/Vietlong Travel.The organisation of the travel and trips was excellent.We had a bit of a hiccup when about to leave Hoi An,the evening before we were notified by our guide,Oanh,that we would be flying to Hanoi instead of taking the train,as it would be mayhem on it owing to the Lunar New Year.We were a bit surprised at this,but however it meant we were staying an extra night in the city at no expense to us.All the trips were well organised,with any extra tickets being paid for in advance by Vietlong Travel.Even on the Halong Bay trip we were given a bottle of decent red wine with our meal,others had to pay for their drink.The only minor complaint we would have is,a bit more information from the guides when traveling to the destinations wouldn't go amiss,after all everything in this extremely interesting country was new to us.It was good to feel in safe hands when visiting Vietnam,and Citrus/Vietlong certainly made it a marvelous experience for us.Thank you!"

Had a great tour booked through Citrus and using VietLong Travel for guiding services - I think just in Vietnam as I`m not sure who did the Cambodian end. The guides were generally where they were meant to be to pick us up and showed us the sights giving local knowledge and stories to keep it interesting. The only negative was that we were initially told that we did not have a walking tour in Hanoi when it was clearly stated in our itinerary - even though not in the excursion list. I emailed Citrus and then we got a call later giving us a time for the tour as if it was never in doubt! What spoiled that tour was that it was on the 2nd day rather than the first as we`d expected then and it was quite a hike of a walking tour that would have been better as bus drop offs. That apart the guides were very good and we had a great time and I would recommend VietLong highly."

We had quite a complicated 14-night tour through Cambodia and Vietnam arranged by VietLong through Citrus Holidays - five flights, two buses, five hotels and a Halong Bay cruise. At every pick-up, we were met on time by helpful guides and drivers, even when one of our flights was delayed and both of the buses broke down en-route(!). Halong Bay was just wonderful - fantastic scenery, great food, and a captain and crew who made us feel really welcome. The captain was seen to help swab the decks, serve the food, and even took a great tai chi early-morning session. No class divisions on his boat! The hotels exceeded expectations - we particularly liked the Amaricus Hotel in Hanoi, where we felt truly cherished in a wonderful central location. All the arrangements within VietLong's control worked like clockwork, and overall we had a really memorable trip. Many thanks to all concerned."

It starts in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, includes a 1 hour flight to Luang Nam Tha, has an overnight stay in the Ban Khon Tan village (my favorite part), go to Udom Xai, Muang Khua, take a cruise down river to Nong Kiau, and eventually end in Luang Prabang. There are so many great photo opportunities and adventures to be had along the way. After the biking is done for the day, you will check into your hotel and the guide will recommend attractions for you to visit. The overnight stay in the Ban Khon Tan village is truly amazing. After lunch you will take a long wooden boat an hour down a river to the village. When you arrive the boatman will take you up to the family you stay with for the night. Everyone is very friendly and hospitable. Depending on the weather, you will either get a tour of the village or get better acquainted with the family hosting you. During your overnight stay, you will have opportunities to talk with the community (via the multi-lingual guide usually), eat home cooked meals, and tour the immediate area. Now this is the way to see the real Laos. It is important to stay open minded during this part of the tour especially. You will learn a lot. The tour guides during this trip are locals, so they are skilled in the multiple languages used along the way. Being that there are 49 main ethnic groups ethnic groups recognized by the Lao Government, being multi-lingual is essential for the guides. Have no fear though, as a tourist it is ok to just learn a few key words and phrases. Just showing that you will try will earn you respect among the locals. This is a biking tour, so I recommend trying to work out before your tour. I learned this the hard way. However, the guide will be understanding and will work in rest breaks along the way. The further you go South from Luang Nam Tha, the less mountainous the routes become. All that being said, it is a gorgeous area of the country and I highly recommend this trip."

We have just returned from the above tour and i have to say after being initially wary of all the logistics it turned out to be great.We landed and were picked up by private car at the airport and told that our guide and driver would be with us for the next three days with all tours being private. We spent a fantastic three days in Cambodia the people the food the shopping the tour was all fantastic, we even went on an extra tour to the Koulen Mountain Waterfall, in the hills and swam in a pool below the waterfall( ask your guide its worth it).TheTemples at Angkor Wat are amazing.( dont worry about visas it takes 10 mins at the airport)We stayed in the Wooden Angkor Wat Hotel, the staff were charming and could not do enough for you, get your clothes washed and ironed here 2 dollars a kilo. Just use dollars whilst here it is accepted everywhere. I would also advise to buy gifts here as well.We the moved on to Phnom Penh , try to get a flight from Siem Reap as the roads on the bus journey are awful its not a great journey.The Palace was amazing you will get some amazing photos. The killing Fields were a real history lesson, and the prison were Pol pot tortured his victims is haunting. We stayed at the Silver River hotel( ask for a room at the front)We then took the bus across the border to Hoi Chi Min again all transfers went smooth (fly if you can). Once in Hoi Chi Min visited the Cu Chi tunnels which were amazing i even fired an ak47. We then visited the war museum again a real history lesson. We stayed at the Signature Saigon Hotel again ask for a room with a window, or a front facing room. we then flew to Hanoi, picked up at airport and taken straight to the Siagon Halong Hotel which was a great hotel, ask for a sea facing room and get up at 6.30am for the sunrise..Two days cruising Halong Bay worth the trip in itself.Coached back to Hanoi stayed at the Hanoi Meracus 1 hoteln very good hotel staff could not do enough for you ,just relaxed and enjoyed Hanoi shopping and markets very good. A Fantastic holiday worth every penny with amazing organisation ( Samarth at Citrus is excellent when booking) Thank you Citrus / Vietlong"

We booked with Citrus / Vietlong Travel and although initially wary (we prefer to make our arrangements, book own means of transport and just bumble about with a copy of the Lonely Planet) - we were overwhelmingly happy with how things went - especially as this was a trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary.From the moment we arrived we knew we were in good hands. Our arrival was not the smoothest as our flight from London was Cancelled - so delayed by a day - we even had to end up in the wrong city in Vietnam (no one's fault but the airline) - managed to get a connection- and eventually got to our start in Siem Reap. The emergency phone numbers worked perfectly. Both UK, Vietnam and Cambodian Agents were all kept informed as best as we could make them of the issues while dashing from airline desks to connecting flights. As we missed day one - our guide was kind enough to combine 2 days worth of tours into what would have been day 2... confused yet? Our 2 week tour covered Siem Reap - Phnom Penh - HCMC - Halong Bay - Hanoi.All hotels we stayed in were suitable for the 2 or 3 night stays. Our private cars were clean, and our drivers courteous and polite. The tours were good - and the advice given in between - places to see and eat when not with our guides was very welcome. Transfers all smooth - and it was nice for the guides and drivers to wait with us before we boarded local busses and flights - to check all was ok - and were on our way to the next destination. This was a great touch and made us feel looked after and secure.... even at 2:30am in the morning when our boat was caught in a huge storm in Halong Bay with the loudest thunder and the brightest lightning - everyone was calm - and everything continued as planned. All entry tickets for tours and transport were looked after by or provided by the guides just as our emails and itinerary from Citrus said they would be.Now the thing that made this tour and holiday the experience it was - is simply our guides in each place. Sol - Siem ReapKos - Phnom Penh Nick - HCMCQuinn - Hanoi - Halong Lech - Halong Bay Cruise Tran Loan - Hanoi (apologies if names spelt wrong) Each with their own style and personality. They knew what we wanted to know - and what we already knew - so no need for them to repeat themselves or bog us down with information overload. We had fun, laughed, chatted and discussed our lives in brief - but this is when you get to start to know a place - it's culture through it's people- over a coffee in a local coffee shop, or from hearing the experiences of our guide's parents during the Khmer Rouge - to the freedoms and restraints in today's society in both countries. These are the bits we will cherish - these fleeting but worthy encounters with those intrusted to make our visit a good one. English spoken, Smart both in appearance and intelligence - and able to deal with all of our ridiculous questions and my constant photographing or anything and everything.To echo others - Thank you for a wonderful holiday and experience from start to finish and will happily recommend you to friends and family that wish to travel to Cambodia or Vietnam. Thank you Vietlong Travel - Thank you :-)"

Like a few other reviewers, my wife and I recently enjoyed a fantastic whistle-stop tour of Cambodia and Vietnam organised by Vietlong Travel and Citrus Holidays. The organisation was faultless, all our guides excellent - extremely knowledgeable, friendly and helpful - and the hotels were great (even the Wooden Angkor in Siem Reap, which someone else criticised; while I agree it was definitely a bit 'rustic' by comparison with the other 4 hotels we stayed in, it was still charming, the food was good, the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful, and the rooftop restaurant was a great place to gently begin each day).Siem Reap was a fascinating introduction to Cambodia and its temples were literally breathtaking - that day involved a lot of walking and clambering over ruins, but was probably my favourite part of the whole trip. The following day we also took an optional trip to a waterfall and temple in the mountains - again fascinating and the last 5 miles of the journey are definitely an experience - 'off-road' springs to mind as an apt description.The trip to the floating village was fascinating, but probably would have been even better if taken not right at the end of the dry-season!We tried a variety of great food in Siem Reap, from a street corner caf\u00e9 to one of the best meals of my life at Haven Training Restaurant (book in advance by email).Pub Street was somewhat seedy unless you are 30-something or younger, but don't miss out on the night markets nearby.Next came the journey on the Mekong Express coach to Phnom Penh - another experience not to be missed, very quirky and fun, great to watch the countryside unfold as you travel along for 7 hours, and I am assured they will finish the roadworks some time soon - maybe in five years. Watch out for the pit-stop with fried crickets and dried snails on sale!While we were in Phnom Penh there were royal birthday celebrations with a fantastic firework display. The tour of the royal palace and museums were fascinating, while the trip to the Security Prison 21 and the 'killing fields' memorial were incredibly moving.Next came another long coach journey to the Vietnamese border then on to Ho Chi Minh City, including the rather bemusing and long-winded process of actually crossing the border.HCMC is a hectic and bustling surprisingly (to me) modern city - with apparently 6 million motorcycles and I think we saw most of them. Plenty to see and do with of course lots of interesting history to soak up. We took a trip Cu Chi Tunnels used by the Viet Cong - unmissable and enthralling, including a chance to fire off a few rounds from an AK47 - definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience!We flew from HCMC to Hanoi, where we were picked up and whisked-off to Halong Bay for 2 days, including an excellent overnight boat cruise (reviewed elsewhere) which was well worth it.Back in Hanoi for our final few days, we stayed in a fantastic hotel (the Meracus) in the middle of the Old Quarter - on the street of shoe shops (every street in Hanoi seems to specialise in selling one product). The Old Quarter is buzzing, with a fantastic choice of bars and restaurants. Very easy to get around, but also easy to get slightly lost. An optional guided group tour of the city was fascinating and definitely worth doing- even the slightly nerve-wracking cyclo-tour in the middle of all the frantic traffic!We also took a day excursion out to the '3 caves' river trip - fantastic scenery, but a rather hot and long day.On the last day we toured the city on foot, including the French Quarter, then we were picked-up and driven to the airport for our flight home.Overall an absolutely fascinating trip, a tremendous variety of experiences, somewhat hectic but very well organised. The tour guides absolutely made the experience, with all the extra bits of information they were able to add. Not a trip for those expecting absolute luxury, but certainly one of the most interesting and enjoyable holidays we have had.the only reason I haven't given 5 stars is that some of the excursions should definitely be included as standard - even though this would increase the base price of the holiday, it would have been much less of an experience with those 'extras'."

He was very accommodating with all questions, answering emails promptly. Our tour was comprised of a Mekong Delta tour followed by an 8 day motorbike ride north from Ho Chi Minh City up to Hue. We then took an overnight train from Hue to Hanoi - which I would not recommend to anyone. The train was filthy and had many cockroaches in our first class sleeper cabin (if I was to do it again, I'd fly). We then had a tour of Hanoi, then our vacation ended with a two day Halong Bay cruise. Our guide for this journey was Mr Chung who was excellent, spoke good English and fit in well with our group. He allowed us to amend out tour on the fly and gave us great recommendations on sight seeing and restaurants. He was also able to procure a new scooter when one of ours died on the second day of the trip. On the down side, some of the 3 star hotels we chose were a bit tired, though still clean. If we did it again, we may have chosen 4 star properties. Also, we were told all the motorbikes (we had 5 motorcycles and 1 scooter) would be somewhat new. Unfortunately, only one out of six were new - the others were quite old and as stated above it died on day two. Luckily in addition to the guide, we hired a support truck and mechanic. In addition to ferrying our luggage for the motorbike portion of the trip, they tossed the dead scooter in the back of the truck! Overall, was a fantastic adventure and would do it again in a heartbeat."

Just returned from doing the 2 week tour of Cambodia and Vietnam thru Citrus holidays organised by Vietlong travel - seen on Travelzoo who are excellent. The holiday went like clockwork, guides and cars turned up on time, buses were efficient. Guides were knowledgable and spoke good english. Hotel apart from one were very good standard with hearty breakfasts. Managed to get a good feel for both countries and saw some delightful things and others harrowing. I felt the Angkor wooden hotel let down the stay in Siem Reap. Perhaps we were just unlucky? our room was dirty,towels threadbare and the rooftop where we ate breakfast was sparse and up 4 flights of stairs. After trekking round temples in 35 degrees of heat and dust a hotel with a pool would have been great. I know Vietlong travel have spoken to the hotel and sent our photos of the room as evidence so maybe it will improve? Our boat on the Halong Bay trip was not of the Royal Heritage line but it was okay when we got aboard and the staff and food were great. Very foggy on the trip to monkey island but on our return the sun came out and everyone sat on the deck. Good all round holiday and Vietlong will cater to individual needs if you want to organise your own trip."

Vietlong ensured all airport meetings and transfers were seamless; private travel arrangements and guides were of a high standard. We began our trip in Siem Reap, and travelled also to Phnom Penh, Ho Chi Minh, Halong and Hanoi. All guides were knowledgeable and personable people who were easy to get along with and made our experience on each excursion a bespoke one.There are two things which puts this tour company above any that I have used in any part of the world; firstly, having met Mr Dong at the end of our travels, the company certainly use Tripadvisor and listen to travellers' needs and wishes expressed through that medium. For example, every hotel was in a great location and many of them within the top 10 of their respective Tripadvisor rankings. Two of the hotels had won recent Travellers' Choice Awards.The second aspect which should be praised is that the customer experience is absolutely paramount. It is fair to say we had to change some of our arrangements at the last minute, resulting in the cancellation of a couple of excursions/transfers. Instead of pocketing the remuneration the company received from this, and without even making a request, Vietlong used the extra money to upgrade our Halong Bay cruise, add a further excursion on, and also inform many hotels of my upcoming birthday without me informing them of this!I cannot recommend Vietlong highly enough, we were impressed with our itinerary and all aspects of the service. Now that I have read other reviews on here, it is very clear that they listen carefully and respond immediately."

VietLong Travel Day Tours was suggested to me by my local friend The Anh, who highly recommended this tour as one of the best, and he was right! The Travel bus picked me up promptly at the designated time, right at the front door of my hotel. I was greeted with Good Morning and a smile and we were on our way. We picked up a few other passengers from other hotels, the whole process was quick and efficient. The Travel bus is air conditioned with comfortable seating, making the 4 hour+ trip to Halong Bay a comfortable one. The Bus also has huge unobstructed windows so you have great views, allowing for perfect picture taking opportunities. About half way you stop for a 30 minute rest, at a place where they carve statues, and food and refreshments are offered for a small fee. Very interesting rest stop, and a pleasant place to sit in the shade and stretch your legs while admiring the beauty of the statues, hundreds of them are spread out over the entire grounds. Along the way to Halong Bay you drive through some very remote areas, small towns, and plenty of scenic grandiosity abounds all around you, have your camera ready. Arriving in Halong Bay you aare escorted from your bus to the docks where all the Halong Bay boats are located. The VietLong boat is impressive, very large, well maintained and employing a friendly staff who see to your every need. The upper deck has lounge chairs to allow you to bask in the sunshine while cruising the islands. Belowe is the dining area, tables \"booth\" style with comfortable seating. You are served a very tasty seafood lunch, and beverages are available for purchase. Cruising the Bay is beautiful aboard this boat, solowly through the massive channels where cliffs loom all around.  Then you head to through one particular alcove which leads you to The Caves, the boat docks at the pier and you are led up a somewhat steep stairway, mountainside where you finally enter the Caves...get your cameras out for this..it is simply spectacular. After about 45 minutes in the Caves you are led out again, down to your boat, and set off once again through the glorious mazes of islands and eventually leading you back to your original starting point.  An incredible experience from start to finish, I highly recommend VietLong Travel Day Tours as your choice for top-notch enjoyment, safety, good food, and fabulous times, you can't go wrong with VietLong!"

It's a good thing we had the guide's contact number so we called him up and someone picked us up from the airport and brought us to the hotel. And since it was a midnite arrival, we were not advised to book a room that's exclusive from the package as our tour started the next day. Luckily, we were able to book a room at a discount. The guide and travel agent were very apologetic although a discount would have been preferred as compensation :) From thereon, the tour went smoothly. From our transfer to hanoi-halong bay up to cambodia - everything was good. Our tour guides, Minh from Hue and Narin from Cambodia were very informative and very nice. Always arriving on time and knows their job well. It was a fun trip as we had the chance to ride a cyclo (vietnamese tricycle), a junk, a motorbike, boats, night train and go kayaking all in one trip. In summary, it was a good trip. I would recommend this for travellers who want an \"almost hassle-free\" trip...check out their itinerary... the tour includes around 4 world heritage sites - i love phong nha caves and hoi an and siem reap! You can probably arrange for a cheaper package if you plan it yourself, but i think it's a good buy if you just want to enjoy a relaxing trip without the hassles of planning."

It was suggested by friends that we should book any tours we wanted to do when we arrived in Vietnam. So whilst staying in our Hotel in Hanoi,(Golden Wings 2), with the help of one of the friendly staff (Steven) we organized a trip to Halong bay and one to Sapa. (Steven is originally from Sapa, so had local knowledge). After looking thru a couple of book/brochures, we chose which boat we wanted to stay on. Steven organised all the rest. We were picked up from our Hotel for both tours and all the connections were smooth easy and friendly. On both our tours we met and made friends with other travellers, and it sounded like our \"organisation\" was alot more thorough than some others. Some of our new found friends were left at the train station to fend for themselves at the end of their trip, whilst we were met by a member of our hotel staff, even tho' it was 6:30am and still dark. The trips were both reasonably priced and at the end of them both we were so glad we had chosen to go both to Sapa and to Halong Bay. On our cruise the staff were all great and our guide 'TAM' was so nice and they made the night fun, joining in on the karaoke evening and cooking class. Our local guide in Sapa 'Lala' was really sweet and lots of fun also. All the meals were delicious and plentiful. The train ride was a hoot!! All in all I have No hesitations in recommending this firm to everyone. Do it, you'll have a blast!! Oh and of course the scenery and local people of Sapa and Halong Bay were AMAZING!!"

The reasons I still choose Heritage Cruise are because the price suits my budget and I had experienced no big trouble during my first trip with Heritage. You will see some users reviewing how excellent, while others reviewing how worst the cruise or the crew were. I can only say that, it depends on the person him/herself. Personally, I can say that I enjoyed my trip, and I'd only give neutral opinions about the trip.Since I have no high expectation of how luxurious the cruise would be (please do remember the price you pay for the tour), I was satisfied using Heritage Cruise and Vietlong travel as the agent. Trouble might happened on the cruise, or you met some passengers who didn't want to mingle with others, but it's not a big deal at all and the main point is I still had the fun enjoying the beauty of Halong bay and Catba island. Again my thank you to Ms. Thai Ha as the marketing of Vietlong and to all the guides in Halong and Sapa. It's a pleasure for me to use their service."

Everything about this trip was top notch from the guide, the visits, the transfers from minibus to boat, to Tut-Tut, to the Cruiser. It wasn't cheap but worth every US dollar (or Dong equivalent!).

Each time we received prompt response with changes requested. Normally we organize trips ourselves on the fly, but the simplicity of having everything planned ahead was great. Our driver and guide were always prompt and even took us all the way to checkin to ensure safe passage.

The tour guides (Tinh who was the senior guide and Giang) were just brilliant. They got the balance right of doing their jobs to the best standard but also being friendly and part of the group. The homestays were great and the food outstanding. The weather on the trek was challenging and we encountered broken shoes, leeches, knee deep water, slippery hills and giant beehives.

In my opinion, they try to make you spend too much time on the boat doing dumb things like cooking classes or playing board games instead of admiring the surroundings and relaxing. Moreover, the food was super average, not bad but nothing representative of real vietnamese cuisine. When it comes to the cabins and the staff i have to give them a point...te cabins were perfect and everybody was friendly and helpful to us. As i said, depends on what you are looking for.

Hang prepared our to Tam Coc and Ninh Binh day tour , and also our trip to Ha Long bay and to Sapa , offering lots of options according to our budgets and advising us well informed. The Train to Sapa for example , was a highlight for us. We enjoyed a private room in an old beautiful train and we must thank Hang for that , as we had different plan in mind. The option she gave us for HaLong bay was perfect for us!!!!! This people understand the mood you are looking for (it doesn't matter if you travel with your couple, your family and kids or your firends, they know after 2 minutes what you are looking for in terms of mood )The Tam Coc tour was one of our best days in Vietnam!!!We were picked up at our hotel by Dien and Minh (the best driver we found in Vietnam during our 14 days, and this is very important to emphasize). Our guide , Dien (which i deeply recommend to all of you for this tour) of course speaks great English, but most important showed a deep knowledge of Vietnamese history at Ninh Binh Temples and an great common sense when it comes to explain historical facts , so different and so similar as well in some cases to European facts (by the way, we liked so much the history about 2 kings in particular , that we ended up buying a book in amazon back home!). We really loved our day tour and we loved friend Dien !!Our trip to Vietnam was awsome , we were surprised about how warm people was to us, in the streets, in the bars, in the hmong's villages, in the street food small places, in hotels.....we found so natural, hard work, caring, easy going and happy people at the north of Vietnam !!!! we got back to our home in Madrid with a nostalgic feeling.

From start to finish the service Carol and her team provide is seamless. Everything is handled with efficiency and a lot of care is taken with attention to detail. The vehicles and drivers they use are smart and professional. It was very reassuring to have such a competent supplier, especially when dealing with VIP guests. I feel the cost is very reasonable as well. I highly recommend the services Buffalo Tours offer - special thanks to Carol, Shilah and Roland for all the help."

They were always up for a laugh, muck around and a bit of banter but were always looking out and making sure of that all of our squad were safe at all times. They made sure with my allergies to iodine I never ate any prawns or crayfish and even went out of Thier way to get a good aussie lunch with chips and chicken. All in all if I could rate them they would be 11 out of 10 and definitely want to go for another trip with Vuttha, Ty and Vet all amazing people. I would recommend them for anyone wanting to safely, humorously and have a good time viewing temples and city's of Cambodia."

Our first trip was to the Cu Chi tunnels for half a day. Our guide, Wang, was an absolute wealth of knowledge and passionate about what he does. He also had a very good sense of humour. Wang made the trip interesting, informative and intimate. It was almost like spending the morning with an old friend. Whilst on this tour, we decided to book the Nui Dat one for the following day. To do this we had to go to the office in Saigon where we were greeted by Chau who does the bookings. Her warmth, knowledge and fantastic customer customer service are second to none. Other tour operators could learn a lot from Chau. The following day we left our hotel early heading for Nui Dat. We were lucky enough to have Wang as our guide again, so by now we really did feel like old friends. Stopping in Baria, we picked up our local guide, Tuan, whose knowledge of the Australian involvement in the War astounded all of us. First stop was Long Phouc where we paid respect at the pagoda and entered the tunnels. It must be added that these tunnels are bigger than the ones at Cu Chi and very close to the former base at Nui Dat. Arriving at Nui Dat was somewhat emotional as my father is a Vietnam Veteran and \"lived' at \"the Dat\" for 12 months. There was not one spec of earth that Tuan did not know anything about. He even led us to \"the Back Gate\", which is the area my Father was based. Standing in the humidity among the rubber trees was very humbling. At Long Tan we had a small service, with Tuan giving the ANZAC Ode. Very moving. This man's warmth and humour shone. He even knew the lyrics to Ocdaloi Cheap Charlie and sang us Advance Australia Fair. Obviously he has met a lot of Australians! We bid him goodbye back at Baria where we had a delicious lunch. Then it was back in the vehicle for the ride to Saigon. An amazing day and I can honestly say that it is something I shall never forget, not only because I have always wanted to go to Nui Dat, but also because of our wonderful guides Wang and Tuan. If you are considering booking any sort of tour in Saigon and the surrounding areas, Buffalo Tours are definitely the ones to go through. Do not even contemplate going to anybody else. This tour operator is a professional organisation that really does care about their client's experiences. Thanks for making our stay in Saigon even better than we thought it would be!!"

They arranged train tickets from Hanoi to Sapa, as we specifically wanted to see the weekend markets in Can Cau and Bac Ha. They also arranged the train trip back to Hanoi and a cruise in Halong Bay, followed by a train trip to Hue. We also had a fabulous guide and private driver. All this planning, train ticketing, getting to the markets, etc. were far beyond my feeble capabilities. Hooray for Buffalo Tours! The local guides and drivers met us at all the train stations and made sure we were settled in our hotels. The guides and drivers were safe, knowledgeable and kind, and they accommodated special requests with grace. If not for this help, I don't think we would have been comfortable in the relatively small towns and rural areas around Sapa. As a bonus, the guides and drivers took us to several ethnic villages that we would not have even known to ask about!There was one last-minute change in hotels (instead of staying in Sapa after the Can Cau market, we stayed in Bac Ha, which is much closer to the market in Can Cau). Buffalo Tours was able to arrange the change in only a few minutes. There was also an issue with our visas to enter Vietnam. Buffalo tours took total responsibility for a mistake that was partly theirs, but we had failed to carefully check our visa letter. Even though we arrived in Hanoi on a national holiday, Buffalo Tours read my urgent e-mail (sent from LAX), and they sent a woman to meet us as we stepped off the plane! She navigated all the airport visa bureaucracy, and Buffalo Tours paid all the extra charges for an \"urgent visa.\"I cannot say enough good things about Buffalo Tours. These are just a few details among the many that resulted in a rating of Excellent."

Its a good idea to have some basic background knowledge as the summary from the guide didnt do justice to the Aussie diggers and the Long Tan battle but part of that could be a language thing even though he is better than most. Nice touch was supplying flowers and short commemorative service. Really enjoyed visiting the kindergarten and handicapped markets too. Tour was about 7.5 hours rather than the 10 advertised which was a bonus. The Kfc style lunch was disappointing in that local cusine would have added to the experience however Dingo was very concerned about making sure the food was something we would eat. All in all a good experience with lots of laughs but probably something only for those really interested in Aussie involvement in Vietnam."

We worked with Marianne from the US and Loan from Vietnam. They answered all of our questions and put together a wonderful itinerary with a great balance of activity, culture and history, which is exactly what we wanted!I would highly recommend Buffalo tours!"

Well after speaking with a few I realised doing it myself will be super tough and when I found Thu in Hanoi, she was my answer. Thu was excellent, wasn't too controlling like others, was flexible and at all times let me drive the decisions and she managed the options. I must admit I was a bit of a headache but she was very patient with me. She even made time to meet with us on the day we arrived to say hello in person (in the poring rain too). Throughout our 13 day visit she stayed in touch and I always knew she was around to help if We needed her. We had many guides throughout the trip as we visited many destinations but there were 2 stand outs for usHoa and driver (sorry forgot his name) in Hanoi. Hoa was attentive, full of knowledge and couldn't do enough for you , we even laughed at most of his jokes :-))) driver was again very flexible when we asked slight off plan trips he helped us out. Then it was Vuttah and Den in Cambodia, again both were super focused on ensuring at every minute of the time we spent together our needs were attended, it was light hearted but informative and also humbling when we heard how much they love their jobs and what it actually meant to them. Both sets of driver and guides made a good experience .... GREAT !!!We could learn much about work attitude from people such as these !!All other guides were good also but these stood out for us. A trip of a lifetime managed in a professional, secure and fun way. Thank you Buffalo Tours we will def use you again when we return to AsiaTam Biet"

She helped us plan a wonderful Meking Tour, with an amazing guide and driver, and a never to be forgotten nighttime Vespa tour. We were pleased to see, that this company, was also at the Victoria Hotel in Sapa, where we also booked terrific tours.This is a first rate company, thank you, thank you"

Our trip included all transfers so we were met at Siem Reap airport by our guide Phun Yann who accompanied us everywhere whilst we were in the Angkor Wat area along with our driver Denn who was ready with cold water and refreshing wipes at every turn. They were wonderful. Yann was a fountain of knowledge and made it all so interesting that I need not have worried that our three (early twenties through to late teens) kids would be bored - they weren't. Our request was not too many temples!! So our trip included the expected tour of Angkor Wat and other temples but we did them on mountain bikes. We had a sunset tour of the countryside around Siem Reap on quad bikes, we had a dip in a waterfall at the Phnom Kulen mountains, we visited the stilt village of Kampong Kheng on the Tonle Sap Lake and learnt how to make traditional brooms and mill rice in a village that Buffalo Tours works with training their residents to become tour guides.Buffalo tours organised lunch every day and we were really well fed - a great way to be introduced to Cambodian cuisine.We then had a few days in Phnom Pehn, where our guide was Sokha again a fountain of knowledge. He escorted us to the Killing Fields and the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and gave us the information we wanted but the space to reflect whilst in these locations. When we had a problem with our hotel in Phnom Pehn again Buffalo tours came up trumps and interceded with the hotel on our behalf.I cannot recommend Buffalo Tours highly enough. They were excellent. Thank you Buffalo Tours for an unforgettable holiday."

We had a wonderful two days with Buffalo Tours exploring the major temples, a Cambodian village, and Tonle Sap Lake.Our guide Thy (or Mr T) was extremely knowledgeable, professional, thoughtful, and generous. The service was impeccable. Thy provided interesting insights into Cambodia today in addition to teaching us about significant Cambodian history. We learnt many things from him we would otherwise not have come to know.We traveled in a comfortable air conditioned car, with frequent offers of icy cold bottled water. Our driver was also very courteous and professional.On the first day we watched the beautiful sunrise over Angkor Wat, then visited Angkor Thom, Ta Prohm, and after a delcicious lunch and a rest, went back to explore Angkor Wat and watch the sunset from Pre Rup. Thy explained the significance of each temple, with engaging and educational stories.On the second day we visited a village in the Siem Reap area. Here we also met Suy Vet from the ETA project and learnt about the wonderful work they do in providing education facilities to their community. We had a go at refining rice and making brooms with the locals, and had the very unique and special opportunity to see the Cambodian rural way of life. After lunch we went to a Buddhist temple to receive a blessing, and then visited Tonle Sap lake and the floating village.Altogether it was an extremely educational, fun and inspiring tour. Thank you very much to Thy and the Buffalo Tours team for the wonderful experience."

In that time I travelled through Hanoi, Hoi An, Saigon, the Mekong Delta, Phnom Penh and Siem Reap.What a wonderful itinerary, packed with a diverse range of cultural experiences, I had 5 tour guides, I give top marks to 4 of the 5 guides, but the Phnom Penh guide let the company down and that's why I couldn't give an excellent rating (I've sent Buffalo a direct email about this though). The other 4 guides were wonderful. With good English and a thorough knowledge of both historic and contemporary issues, I learnt so much, saw so much and experienced so much. It didn't matter what I asked, they always were able to respond in a considered and informed way.Special thanks Tang in Hanoi, I so enjoyed my time learning about the history of Hanoi, Confucianism and the heroic women. Also special thanks to Tin my guide in Saigon and the Mekong Delta, exceptionally good English and such a depth of knowledge, he is a real asset to your company. Also special thanks to Vuttha Dam and Sok Chea my guide and driver in Siem Reap, they were wonderful as well.The tour guides and drivers were considerate, obliging and very knowledgeable, great ambassadors for Vietnam and Cambodia. I would have no hesitation recommending Buffalo Tours as a great way to tour Vietnam and Cambodia and if others are as fortunate as I was to get one of the above guides you'll have an amazing experience!"

Our guide met us at the hotel and we took a taxi to the old quarter for a quick cyclo ride, which we had not yet tried. Cyclo is strictly for tourists, so it was nice to have some one negotiate the route and cost for us. The cyclo drivers were very nice. One especially tried to make it as fun as possible for my son by racing with the rest of us. We were dropped of at the citadel and we walked. Our guide asked us how comfortable we were walking, and as we are from a walking city, we said very comfortable, so he took us on the longest route. We saw Ho Chi Min's memorial and watched the changing of the guard. Then the one pillar pagoda, the botanical gardens, the Chua Tran Quoc temple, the site of John Mcain's crash, and the site of his landing........We stopped for a little snack of fresh rice paper wrapped beef which was delicious and we walked around west lake and the west lake neighborhoods. After about 8 km we were tired and took a taxi back to our hotel, full of history and a great appreciation for the beauty of Hanoi."

It was fascinating to see village life, the river its High Street. A school performance for parents and a billiard hall were 2 of the things that made me smile. On then to the Land Mine museum - it tells of the tradgedy of the mines and the work of one great Cambodian determined to remove the danger. Our last day was much easier than I had feared as we cycled through the Jungle and roads of Angkor visiting temples. Vuttah paced us perfectly and produced fresh fruit at just the right time.

Chet was excellent - very informative with his vast history knowledge and extremely courteous and thoughtful. He did not hurry us as it was a very hot and exhausting day - with so much to see. My friend and I were in our late 60s and Chet was considerate of our needs. Even though it did not look like rain when we set off he carried umbrellas - which were very good at keeping the hot sun off us and also the rain when it did arrive, as he anticipated - due to the habit of the low flying wasps! He also carried my large handbag when it became too heavy for me to manage - saying he was 'used to carrying his baby around!' There was plenty of cold water and cold hand and face wipes provided - which were very welcomed in the heat. Chet also knew that we needed to be at Angkor Wat before the long queues began to form to get up to the top viewing level - so when we saw how long it was after we had completed our tour - we were extremely grateful that he had gotten us there just ahead of the afternoon crowds! Chet kept offering to take photos for us, advised us where the best places to stand to get the best shots and also knew of some positions for 'special effects' photos. I would have no hesitation in highly recommending Buffalo Tours and our guide, Chet. His smiling face and very caring and pleasant manner made this day tour very enjoyable. Thankyou to Chet and Buffalo Tours for a most professional, enjoyable and informative experience."

Over the 5 days we stayed in Cambodia, Vuttha felt like a member of our team. My grandmother is 77 and she came on a very grueling hot trip with us and Vuttha spoiled her so much. I was so pleased that whenever I looked back to check on Grandma, Vuttha was always there making sure she was okay. We always had cold water and Vuttha insists on opening the bottle for you ;) I feel like I really got a glimpse of The deep and sad history of Cambodia at the Killing Fields and Prison, but the people of Cambodia are so optimistic and kind you begin to wonder how can people who have gone through so much hurt and sadness be so positive and caring. I truly got the Cambodian experience I was after. The night market was totally fun we ate fried tarantulas and got real silly.Bike riding to the temples was an amazing experience I will never forget. It was a difficult ride for me since it was 90 degrees and I don't typically ride bikes far distances but Vuttha kept checking in and made sure we were all comfortable. He provided us with bananas and water to make sure we could get through this amazing journey and we ended with an amazing air conditioned lunch! I would take this trip again, and I would bring as many friends as I could, it was a truly eye opening experience for me.When we arrived in Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam we were greeted by Tinh. I quickly noticed that Tinh was a jokester like me. He has a very Vietnamese sense of humor which I totally appreciated. I think we got lucky twice because both of our guides feel like life long friends, maybe they treat all their clients that way? I think its awesome that I felt totally safe with both of our guides. I imagine without guides I would have had a totally different experience. They took the time to explain things to me, and the differences between their culture vs american culture. They both seem very familiar with America and history in general I was very impressed. I have a better understanding of what it would be like to grow up in both Vietnam and Cambodia. MUST SEE in Vietnam is Hoi An, Halong Bay !!!"

Vuttah Dam was not only extremely knowledgeable about the sights we visited, but also on the history and challenges the Cambodian people have lived through in recent past. I left with a much better understanding of the culture, the people and the country. Thank you Vuttah and Buffalo tours for a wonderful experience! We are sure to be back and will definitely use your services again."

We booked a private tour through Buffalo Tours to Angkor Wat for just my husband and I with a driver and a tour guide. We had the absolute pleasure of being guided by Mr Sdkuichet (Chet) Chin who was absolutely fantastic. Chet greeted us at our hotel and throughout the day Chet was friendly and flexible and was willing to leave when we wanted to, or to stay longer looking at particular things. We visited some temples in the morning and it was extremely hot. Chet made sure we had plenty of water and each time we got back into the car we were given ice cold water and a refreshing chilled hand/face wipe. We were driven back into Siem Reap for an absolutely delicious lunch at a lovely local restaurant. While we were there it poured with rain and when we were ready to leave, Chet and the driver were there with umbrellas to keep us dry. As it was still raining hard we asked Chet if we could go to the National Museum to stay out of the rain and Chet happily accommodated our request. When we finished at the Museum, the rain had stopped so we went back to Angkor Wat to finish our visit. We cannot praise Chet enough - his knowledge of the temples, palaces and history of Angkor Wat and Seam Reap is outstanding! His English is good and he is polite and so helpful. He took photos of us at different spots and he even carried our umbrellas. He was mindful of us walking and climbing the many steps and gave us sit down breaks throughout the day as we are both in our middle 60's. Overall, we had a fantastic day with lots of memorable experiences - all due to Chet! We would recommend Chet to anyone who is coming to Siem Reap and would like a guided tour."

The tour was much more expensive than what you would pay for at other vendors (40USD VS. 15 USD), however, it did not matter to us. The tour to Cu Chi tunnels was good, the tunnels are interesting and we were happy with that. However, what we were completely shocked by is that after the tunnels we were taken to a disabled people's camp where the disabled people live and make art. This was not part of the agenda provided to us on the day and it was crystal clear that it was organised by the tour guide and van driver as their side business: they take tourists to the camp, tourists feel sorry for the disabled people and buy some art and the management and the tour guide split the money. I asked multiple times what is the benefit of this to the disabled people and did not get an answer. It is absolutely disgusting to exploit disabled people for money making purposes and 'show them' as museum exhibitions. The whole experience felt like being at a human zoo. We later explained the situation to the management who confirmed that we were not supposed to be taken there, however, they failed to understand the severity of the issue claiming that they have no control over the establishment we visited. They did not understand that there is nothing wrong with such an establishment (if they provide work for disabled people), however, it is wrong for Buffalo Tours to take tourists there and demonstrate disabled people as museum exhibits, get money from tourists and not pass the money onto the disabled people. Disabled people should be treated as anyone else and such abuse of their basic human rights if disgusting. Very disappointed that Buffalo Tours does not understand basic human dignity, neither on the tour guides nor on the management level."

A nice welcome after lots of stressful travelling! The rep in Cambodia, Saroun, was particularly helpful and friendly and was happy to tell us lots about a country we had never visited before. While in Cambodia we visited Angkor Wat with buffalo tours and the trip was faultless. Saroun was there again to drive us, so it was nice having a familiar face in the morning. We also met our guide for the temples, Vuttha Dam, who I must say is one of the best guides I've ever experienced whilst being abroad! His English was excellent and he was very knowledgeable about the temples we were visiting. He also taught us so much about his country which was so fascinating. A real asset to buffalo tours!As a whole buffalo have been great and I'm glad we booked with them.

We did a number of tours and they were very informative with very good guides - no concern there. Where it all turns a little odd (upon reflection now) is that each one of these tours took us to different places and recommended different retailers (i.e. Specific clothes making, specific dining, through what we now think we're premeditated visits). Today we visited marble mountain which was not planned or asked for on the way to Da Nang airport and Buffalo Tours parked nicely in the shade of a family marble stone carving business. We were escorted through this family business and pressured (more than any other time we have experienced) to buy from them. Even in Australia standards they were expensive, very expensive! Anyway one of their family members then escorted us across the road, through the old demolition sites - avoiding all other marble retailers to get to the base of marble mountain. Upon our return we ventured back alone through the many other vendors of different sizes and quality. All far cheaper than the family business that Buffalo Tours sent us through. No big gripe here as everyone is making a living here and taking some advantages of tourists when you can just happens and is to be expected. However upon reflection I think there were too many occurrences between buffalo tours and very specific businesses having what looks from the outside to be more a commercial relationship rather than more like a \"guide\" company should be.Just beware. I would like to think that Buffalo Tours are more independent than this.Sorry Buffalo Tours - you're service was great, but unfortunately rightly or wrongly, this was the last impression you left with us. I hope this is not how you do business."

They reminded me of Abercrombie and Kent guides in knowledge, personality, predicting our needs, and shifting itinerary due to weather etc. Vattha Dam is incredibly well informed, speaks excellent English, and goes out of his way to make his guests feel welcomed. As the son of a teacher, you can tell learning is important to him, but also in how he shares his country's history with you. He had answers for all our questions. He also always pointed out bathrooms and lent a hand when going up and down the shallow temple steps. Mr Dam explained Hindi myths in his cheerful deep voice that makes it sound as if you're listening to an audiobook by Morgan Freeman. He even shared his personal family history that gave us a deeper understanding of Cambidian people plight. He is a star. Det, the driver, somehow managed to always have a cool car waiting for us by the time we returned from each temple. I felt safe with him behind the wheel. While we thought about doing this portion on our own with a combination of taxis and guidebooks, we could not have seen or learned as much without this team from Buffalo tours. Book Vattha Dam and Vet for an informative, seamless, and inspiring tour at Angkor!"

Great experience with Buffalo tours- booking process - exceptional- communication - exceptional- all our needs were accommodated, we were well informed on everything- guides were great- organisation - greatWe did a 6 day tour with them including Hanoi, Sapa and Halong bay. Our guide was excellent and we really felt taken care off. We don't often rely on tour operators but this time we simply didn't have the time to plan the trip and decided to get some help. It was a blissful experience, We didn't have to worry about anything. Everything was simply taken care of. Thank you Tran Hai Ngoc and Nguyen Hai Phuong for making our trip so easy and memorable!"

Vichet was a wealth of knowledge on the area as well as detailed information on the temples and the stories behind the making of the temples. My daughter and I were very impressed with his knowledge and professionalism. He then took us to a wonderful lunch and my daughter was tired from the heat so he took her back to the hotel and we improvised a tour of the area to see how the locals lived. Overall, I would highly recommend Vichet Chin if anyone is in the Siem Riep area and wants to do a day tour of the temples or other attractions."

Her attention to every travel detail resulted in our absolute enjoyment of each awesome, adventurous day of our truly fascinating & spectacular month of February when we visited Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand & Vietnam. Our itinerary included Hanoi, Sapa, Luang Prabang, Nong Khiew, Muang Ngoi, Chiang Mai, Inle Lake, Loikaw, Kalaw, Heho, Bagan, Mt. Popa, Yangon, Kawthaung, Macleod Island, Bangkok, Siem Reap, Phnom Penh, Chau Doc, & Ho Chi Minh City. Often we were in rural, agricultural farm areas with indigenous villagers, or on the scenic Ou river, the busy Mekong Delta, the pristine Inle lake or the serene Macleod Island with great snorkeling where the only inhabitants live at one eco-lodge. We rode majestic elephants in a sanctuary near Luang Prabang, visited the long neck ladies at their homes where we chatted & drank rice wine, & ate lunch with over 300 young girls & Buddhist nuns at their orphanage where we donated their lunches that day. Our guides and drivers were professional, especially our guides Khan Keo Indavong in Luang Prabang, Ussada Napaporn in Chiang Mai, Than Zaw Htay in Inle Lake, Win Naing Htwe & Nay Myo Htet in Yangon, Htet Aung in Bagan, Hla Myint Ooster in Bangkok & nice lady in Chau Doc where we rode bicycles through villages along lush green paddy fields. Each of our luxurious hotels were exceptional, especially all the Victoria Hotels which are affiliated with Buffalo Tours: Victoria Sapa Resort & Spa, Victoria Express overnight sleeper train between Hanoi & Sapa, Victoria Xieng Thong Palace in Luang Prabang, particularly the Victoria Angkor with a gourmet french cuisine restaurant in Siem Reap, Victoria Nui Sam Lodge in Chou Doc, & other hotels such as Tamarind Village in Chiang Mai, Aureum Palace in Bagan & especially in Inle Lake, Myanmar Andaman Eco-Lodge Resort on Macleod Island in the Merqui Archipelago, and Emm Hotel, with a Buffalo Tours office located within, in Ho Chi Minh City. Each Victoria Hotel offers excellent accommodations & service! Since Buffalo Tours has offices in most Southeast Asian capitals, each office had the capability to attend to our every last minute request & to immediately organize our additional half-day guided tours. Buffalo Tours has the resources & contacts abroad to organize every detail of an extraordinary itinerary at a competitive price. Planning our trip with Ms. Hao & Buffalo Tours was an absolute pleasure. We will always remember our memorable & fabulous journey!"

We have recently enjoyed an amazing 14 day tour of Cambodia, taking in not only Phnom Penh and Siem Reap (and Angkor Wat, of course) but also southern places such as Kep and Sihanoukville, Battambang and Kampot which provided a variety of experiences to balance out the temple visits. We gained a deep insight into the history of the Cambodian people and an appreciation of their history which has shaped their lives today. We are left in awe of their optimism and resilience.Highlights for my husband and I included the adventurous boat rides to Rabbit Island and Lake Tonle Sap, the ancient temples and the cuisine. We dined at a variety of restaurants some of which were very classy. We enjoyed some free time which allowed for shopping, massages, swims, or simply having 'time out'. The itinerary was great but it took our amazing guide, Sokhoeun Bout, to bring it all to life for us. The knowledge he shared was only matched by his passion and enthusiasm not only for his homeland but also for his job. While thetr were long bus trips, necessary for us to see so many different locations and their features, these were made pleasurable because of Sok's informative discourses, his personal stories, jokes and even singing. He was an incredibly happy, engaging, warm and friendly guide who knew his 'stuff' and at all times showed care and concern for each and every member of the tour. He went out of his way to meet individual needs and constantly checked to ensure he had dietary requirements (and, in some instances, preferences) met by the menus provided at the restaurants. Time and time again he went out of his way to serve the needs of particular people who experienced illness, an injury, a lost or damaged device and even met the request of one tour member for an 'experience' which was not on the itinerary. As a teacher, I found Sok's English to be very good. He made sure he was understood by speaking loudly, clearly and at a good pace as well as repeating when necessary.Touring a country like Cambodia, so very different from our own, would not have been the wonderful experience it was without our fantastic guide. At all times we felt safe and confident in his capable hands. Buffalo Tours and Wendy Wu need to make sure future tour groups benefit from his skills, expertise, dedication and warm personality.Jenny and Shane (Tasmania)"

Sok was also exceedingly informative about his native country and was able to juggle the difficulties associated with the Khmer New Year, arranging alternative activities and visits for sites that were closed. I have serious seafood/fish allergies and Sokhouren made sure that I was given other dishes of equally delicious food that would not make me sick. The food that he arranged for the group was unbelievable, and world class. I especially liked the Khmer cuisine and didn't miss Western food at all - after all we can eat this any time we like on returning to Australia. I am an English teacher and found that his English was fine, no problem at all to understand IF one was listening to him and not talking. Sok also had a wonderful sense of humour which brightened every day for all but the most negative of people. I would have to agree that the group was way too large but Sok managed the size very well. As some of the older people on this tour, my husband and I were well aware that there could be long hours travelling, and our fitness levels had to be good - this was very clear in the itinerary and Wendy Wu brochure. We would not have gone if we felt we were unfit to do the activities. We managed everything very well and enjoyed ourselves immensely. What a great guide you have in Sokoeun Buffalo Tours - thanks very much for giving him to us to be our national guide. Couldn't think of anyone better to lead this tour. Well done!!! Thanks to Wendy Wu too but please make the group smaller next time."

Sok went over and above to make sure everyone was happy and enjoying themselves...he had many challenges that were not expected from minor injury,sickness and hospitalisation, which he handled very professionally and still managed to make sure the others didn't miss out on any of the itinery..He was always smiling and made the trip very memorable..I have been on many trips and had many guides and Sok is right up there in the ratings The only disappointing aspect of the trip was the size of the group,the too long days on the bus and the drought.

It wasn't a very great tour...extremely long hours on a bus, but the country is in a 2 year drought so knowing that yet still taking us to a waterfall that had no water wasn't very good, however our tour guide Sokhouen was a gods send, and amazing tour guide, he catered for the drought and offered us different alternatives despite the fact the company didn't do that, he catered for restaurants for myself being vegetarian, the group was way too big though but Sok did his upmost best to be heard unfortunately a few clients would talk over him so he kept having to repeat himself, good English I was able to understand him well. He told jokes and even sang in Khmer on the bus I wouldn't recommend this tour to older people as a lot needs to be fixed and a few accidents occurred.but I would gladly do another tour ONLY IF Sokhouen was running it .my boyfriend ended up in hospital with a bacterial infection and kept vigil all night who else would do that??Wendy Wu is lucky to have such a hard worker.Keep the guide change the tour!!"

Our recent experience in Hanoi/Halong Bay, Vietnam was made so much better by having a wonderful tour guide to look after us.As part of our holiday we arranged a 3 day/2 night cruise in Halong Bay with Indochina Junk Tours on their impressive Dragon Legend 2. This was awesome!As part of the service, Buffalo Tours arranged for us to be met at our hotel in Hanoi and driven four hours in a private car to the port in Halong Bay. The return trip to Hanoi was also arranged.\u0110i\u1ec1n Nguy\u1ec5n was booked as our tour guide and he was wonderful! He was prompt meeting us at every stage of our trip and his kind, warm, funny, friendly, professional and helpful nature made us feel looked after, secure and at ease. He completely embodies our idea of how the perfect tour guide should be.During the four hour drive to Halong Bay, \u0110i\u1ec1n was conversational and informative, providing us with historical facts and interesting information about Hanoi, Halong Bay and Vietnam. His english was excellent, which allowed us to have very detailed and succinct conversations. This was that most enjoyable way to pass the time and made the four hour trip seem like only half an hour. On our return drive to Hanoi after our cruise, \u0110i\u1ec1n was very helpful, booking a cooking class for us, recommending a restaurant and reserving a table for us and giving us extra information on places to see and things to do during our last few days in Hanoi. In my opinion, he went above and beyond what we expected from him and this was greatly appreciated.If you are travelling somewhere like Vietnam, where you don't speak the language or are familiar with the customs, we highly recommend engaging a tour guide. Your trip will be so much smoother and more pleasurable for it!"

Highly recommend this tour as you will learn more with a guide than by yourself. Recommend booking not on a weekend if you can as the lines at the mausoleum are really long to see ho chi minh. It's also closed on Monday and friday. Tip .. you need to have your knees and shoulders covered for mausoleum and no photos inside."

His knowledge of both local and National history, culture and customs was endless. Added to that he was entertaining, spoke very well and we 'always' felt we were being looked after, even individually you felt he was watching out for you.

We also drove from Hue to Hoi An with her where she pointed out places of interest, things to do and places to eat, helpful tips and hints. With Duongs extensive knowledge and infectious personality she was an absolute delight to have as a guide.

As the saying goes first impressions are lasting impressions.Buffalo tours were only commissioned to do our airport transfer to our hotel by our local travel agency (Flight Centre). This simple task was so professionally executed, the meet and greet, the mode of transport, wifi en route, water, friendly driver and strategically a welcome pack that out lined all their services, a contact in Hanoi and confirmation of our return transfer. This single task made us feel extremely comfortable in a country we were visiting for the first time.To our horror when we arrived at our hotel we realised sadly that our local travel agent had completely stuffed up our booking, wrong city, wrong tour, gaps in accommodation.In desperation we visited the Buffalo Tours desk in a near by hotel, Ms Pham Thu Hang, the lady on duty, was our hero. She immediately stepped up to the challenge at hand, organised 5 tours for us, arranged all our transfers, constantly kept us informed on each tour where there was no confirmation. She professionally gave us various options to chose from, using her knowledge of the products on offer gave us the best possible choices at our disposal.She also checked in after every tour. The most comforting thing was after coming into our hotel on the evening prior to a tour, we would be advised by hotel staff of our pick up times the next day!!Each of the suggested tours were awesome, guides were professional, and very well executed.In conclusion, an all round fabulous experience leaving us wanting more.Well done Buffalo Tours"

She put in an immense effort and really put together an exquisite itinerary for us. She was very knowledgable about all the tour and accommodation options. We had a full range of experiences, exactly as we had originally wanted, and the value for money we got was exceptional. In addition she was constantly available for queries and checked in during our vacation to ensure that we were getting on well. We were really highly impressed by Hang.The tour guides and drivers we met over the course of the week were all also highly professional, knowledgable and a pleasure to spend time with.All the tours ran like clockwork. The included meals were all of a really high standard, and were always great value for money.Because of Buffalo tours and Ms Pham Thu Hang in particular, we had a fantastic Vietnam experience.

The highlights of our tours were our wonderful guides, who accommodated the trip to our interests and abilities, were consistently knowledgeable and good-humoured, and provided insights into local culture and history and daily life which we would not have otherwise had. I would particularly site our guide in Hanoi, Dang Minh Duc, and our guide in Hue & Hoi An, Huynh Tran Thuy Duong.

Uncle Driver (a name I invented in my head) was very considerate everytime I sat at the very front because of my motion sickness. In Cambodia we had Bon Bun, Bon Yann, Bon Vet, Bon Prohn, Bon Heng and Bu Tol. It was like having an extended family of brothers who would always fix my bike and help me get back on my bike. I cannot adequately put pen to paper to describe how gracious, helpful and friendly all these tour guides were. They have been humble and open to our thoughts and opinions. They have delivered more than what was expected. From the smallest thing such as deviating from the set menu to accommodate my daily whims of not wanting to eat meat or seafood, through to buying bigger water bottles for us because we didn't like the harmful use of plastics, taking us to night markets when it was off the itinerary, offering assistance when we've fallen off our bicycles, and accepting our Facebook friend requests. I am so glad I was able to compete my cycle challenge with such competent tour guides. I never saw them drink during our hour long rides under the sun! Without a moments hesitation, I would choose Buffalo Tours again if I was cycling in South East Asia again."

I could not imagine a better group of guides to do this ride with and it is something I will never forget for all the right reasons.The Cambodian people welcome you so easily into their homes, and our guides were absolutely a bunch of the best men I have ever met with their caring personalities and always wanting to ensure everyone was enjoying themselves and was well informed about the country we were in and its history.I will recommend these people and this group forever and to everyone! Had the best time ever and will miss them a lot!!"

Cannot speak highly enough of our experience with Buffalo Tours during a 10 day cycling trip from Ho Chi Minh to Siem Reap at one of the hottest times of the year in Cambodia. Suy Vet, Yann Phun and Bunvath Tes were constantly encouraging and fixing any problems that arose along the way, and their support got us through some pretty challenging conditions. They also shared their knowledge and passion for their nation, and are examples of tourism making a positive impact on a developing country. Most of our pit-stops for meals were at places where training is being given to street kids, and we were also given a glimpse into life for the people who reside in the villages in the provinces. Thank you hardly seems to convey my appreciation for these fantastic guides."

The group of 16 mainly Australian were escorted by guide, Vuttha Dam who was very knowledgeable and went to great lengths to ensure everyone's comfort. The tour went south to Kep and Sihaoukvile before returning to PP. We then headed north to Battambang and Siem Reap for Angkor Wat. Accommodation was of a good quality and most days we had set meals of local dishes(several courses) lunch and dinner. March is dry season and the previous wet season had seen little rain so the countryside is very parched. Angkor Wat and the surrounding remains are an amazing sight."

They ensured that we were safe and comfortable during our cycling days by providing an abundance of cooled water, soft drinks, fresh fruit (including peeled mangos ready to eat!) and a variety of snacks throughout our breaks.Part of our team included Suy Vet, Yann Phun and Bunvath Tes who were always ready to ensure that our bikes were in excellent working condition whereby any bike mechanical issues were quickly sorted. Part of the tour included visiting the Angkor Temples, and a particularly memorable moment was when Suy showed us a school and library supported by Buffalo tours. It was evident that they cared greatly towards making a positive impact amongst their local community. Our tour guides were able to share lots of information surrounding the history and culture of Vietnam and Cambodia and were always willing and able to answer our many questions.The highest quality of care, hospitality and generousity shown by our tour guides made for a wonderful experience, and I could not recommend Buffalo Tours highly enough!"

With only such a short time, in such a big place, we decided to fill our days and nights with tours so we could see as much as we could. We booked 3 tours with Buffalo, Le Jarai Mekong Delta Cruise, Saigon Street Eats and The Half Day City Tour. All 3 tours were a wonderful experience. The guides were lovely, friendly and very knowledgeable. We were very happy to discover these tours were small group. No large tourist buses in sight. Small vans, personalised service. We could chat freely with the tour guides and ask them anything. Our city tour was a private tour, just for us! The drivers weave in and out of the traffic with such ease that we always felt safe, even in the chaos that is the Ho Chi Minh roads.Our trip on the Mekong had 6 people. When we met up with the other groups for the lunch part of the day there was still only about 15 people. I think the maximum they will take is about 20. The lunch was fabulous. We made the most delicious spring rolls I have ever eaten and learnt how to make beautiful garnishes out of carrots, tomatoes and cucumber. I have wowed my guests back at home with my new skills. We saw a brick making factory and a coconut farm. We went inside a home and learnt to weave and spent some time on the canals off the large river which was really lovely. You really felt like you were in another world on those canals. Much quieter and away from all the hustle and bustle. The Street Eats tour was wonderful. Not only did we eat the most delicious and different food, we saw an insight into the real city life in the back streets during our walk. Parts we would never have ventured into without a guide. The rolls at the oldest bakery in town were to die for and so was the \"Vietnamese pizza\".Would highly recommend this company to anyone wanting to get a real taste of the local life."

We had a great day with Thuy looking at the Cu Chi Tunnels (and got to fire an M16).The day starts with a hotel pick up, which isnt offered by all tour companies as some of our friends needed to get a taxi to the post office to be picked up.Upon pick up Thuy lead us to a very comfortable new car and a couple of bottles of water. On the 1.5 hour trip we discussed vietnam and Thuy shared a run down on some of the history and details of the tunnels from printouts that she had prepared, which turned out to be very valuable as it saved us from having to hang around the busy tourist boards to get the same info.From there we watched a short film and Thuy lead us around explaining all of the exhibits in detail and made us feel comfortable to participate in the various events. I wont spoil the exhibits with details but Thuy had a strong knowledge which she shared.On the ride back Thuy conversed about her history and many of the sites that we drove past, happy to answer any questions we had whilst being very knowledgeable. Her english was extremely good and she was very easy to talk with. Finally she was kind enough to write down some details for local events and great food near our accomodation which was highly appreciated and felt above and beyond what was required. Overall it was a great day trip that i would recommend and definitely ask for Thuy as your guide!"

Our tour company, Great Holiday Collection, booked all our trips for our holiday in Cambodia & Vietnam through Buffalo Tours, and I can't recommend them highly enough. We started in Siem Reap - our guide, the very dignified Sokkhoeun, and our driver, Rath, met us at the airport & transferred us to our hotel, Pavillon D'Orient, Sokkhoern giving us a brief background of Cambodia's history. They arranged to pick us up the next morning at 8am & asked us to bring our itinerery set by GHC with us. They discussed the itinerery & worked out the best way to incorporate it all. We spent Day 1 seeing the Anghor Temples except Angkor Wat, then Day 2 went to Tonie Sap Lake in the morning & onto Angkor Wat in the afternoon. Sokkhoeun's descriptions of both temples & the community living on the lake made our experience so much more rewarding & we felt very safe on the mental roads with Rath!Next stop Hanoi - Loc met us at the airport, transferred us to the hotel & arranged to meet us at 5.30 the next evening for a streets eats tour. This was brilliant & we're so glad we had a private tour, so as we could try everything without being dictated to by faddy eaters. Loc also accompanied us into the airport & got us fast-tracked through check-in.Then onto Hoi An - Phi met us & took us en route to the hotel to a marble factory - not altogether sure why, other than we would probably have been too early to check-in at Ancient House resort. He then arranged to meet us the next morning for a tour of the old town. He was very passionate about central Vietnam& very informative - the only thing was, some of the attractions he took us into - one making silk, which whilst very interesting, they tried to get us to buy their products, which we didn't want, and the same at one of the oldest houses, which has been in the same family for generations. When he transferred us the next day to Danang airport for our flight to Saigon, he had already checked us in.Finally, our guide from Saigon to the Mekong delta & onto Can Tho - so sorry, we can't recall his name, but again, very informative, good sense of humour - only thing was, our flight by Vietnam airlines should have been 9.30am & cancelled as they wanted to combine 2 flights!! to 7pm - because the guide & chauffeur also stranded in CanTho, we felt we were taken to the airport earlier than necessary, possibly to allow them to get back to Saigon earlier!"

It was a group tour of 8 people including ourselves.We were collected from our hotel by our tour guide Lam, and then proceeded to collect the other passengers. The ride out to the mushroom farm was 2 hours. This part of the trip was the worst part. Our driver got lost and had to stop and ask for directions. We did say to Lam as a group we were not worried about the farm and she could miss it and take us straight to the tunnels. (The farm was close to the tunnels). However, a couple of minutes later we arrived. I have to say, it was not worth it. We were only at the farm 10 minutes. We then jumped back in the mini bus and proceeded to the tunnels with no problem. Once at the tunnels Lam guided us around and was very knowledgeable. Having a personal interest she could draw on her own experiences and tales from her father who lived through the war.After that we boarded a speedboat for a trip down the river back towards town. The ride took 1 \u00bd hours, and took us to a riverside restaurant at a local resort. The food was a selection of local dishes and of good quality. You just had to pay for your drinks.Back on the speedboat for another 10 minutes where the mini bus picked us up and dropped us back at our hotel.It was a good trip and as expected. However I do think the mushroom farm should be reconsidered as a destination."

He ensured that the itinerary was such that we visited sites at the best time to miss the crowds of tourist and allowed for the best photo opportunities. This magical journey covered the main circuit consisting of Angkor Ton, Angkor Wat and the infamous Ta Prohm (tomb raiders). We also had a 45 min break for a delicious lunch about half way through which gave us time to relax, cool down and reflect on what Chet had covered which was an extraordinary amount of history and culture as well as countries current situation, all very relevant to the tour.Overall a great experience which was made even more memorable with our fantastic guide Chet.We would recommend that travellers use an experienced guid like Chet (one on one) as it's difficult to navigate to and around the sites which are very large in size and complex culturally and historically, it's really worth the extra cost."

I would recommend them all highly for any visit you have to Cambodia. You won't leave thinking you missed anything except them when you leave. Can not recommend Buffelo and especially these men highly enough. Thank you. Jess x"

The tour was absolutely perfect - it was exciting and we packed loads of different activities in: we saw a puppet show, we saw Wat Arun, we went to the Royal Barge Museum and more! But as we were on a longtail boat, we weren't exhausted by the end of the day which is great! We highly recommend this tour and our tour guide (his name was Dum)."

Vuttha Dam and Ryean Meak welcomed us with friendly smiles at the airport and stayed with us for a further 5 days. Nothing was too much trouble. They ensured we stayed well hydrated, comfortable and well fed. Bronh our bike mechanic joined us on the first day and made sure we were always safe and comfortable on our bikes. Ryean and Bronh made sure we could safely pass through any busy intersections which was much appreciated as traffic was sometimes a little overwhelming! Vuttha was a wonderful tour guide, and provided historical facts and dates, plus personal experiences from his own families journey. Vuttha also ensured that all our meals and hotels met expectations. It was a wonderful experience and I would recommend our three support crew to anyone. Go cycle Cambodia. It is a great way to see the country."

They were amazing and better than I could have taken. He and our driver were always on time, which we really appreciated. We saw some really amazing things and had such a wonderful time and having such a fantastic guide really made the trip. Can't say enough wonderful things. Our driver, Sakhorn, was great - always had bottles of water for us and cold, wet towels as it was so hot when we were there.

We enjoyed every minute of the Cycling Through Mekong tour, which included a pleasant 1 hour nus ride to a shopping center, where we got on bikes (in good condition) to ride 2 hours through various regions of Vietnam on the way to the Mekong Delta. Many people skip the bike ride and just take the bus, but cycling is encouraged for better sight-seeing and to prepare for all the food you get to eat later. Bring sumscreen amd bug spray. We didnt use the bug spray, but we went in a February, so not many bugs were out. When we arrived at Mekong, we got on wood boats to venture through the four islands of the delta, stopping at each one to eat local foods and buy native products. Everyone is very friendly, so make sure to smile and wave to the locals. Overall, our service from guide John and the driver were terrific amd professional throughout our trip. We'd highly recommend Buffalo Tours amd the Cycling Through Mekong excursion to anyone looking for an adventure."

The staff at Buffalo who arranged the tour (first Alex, thenThu and finally Hao) were all very easy to deal with, responding quickly to all of my numerous questions and providing all the information we needed to set up what turned out to be an excellent tour. The 4 tour guides we had during the trip were very friendly, informative, responsive and enthusiastic. They were a key ingredient to the success of our trip. The drivers were also very friendly and motored us around without any problems or stress, which, given the chaotic, congested traffic, particularly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, was quite a feat. We visited Hanoi, Halong Bay (2 nights on a small junk), Hue, Hoi An and Ho Chi Minh City with day trips to sites outside of those cities. We had 2 flights included in the tour via Vietnam Airlines. The hotels were excellent (Intercontinetal Westlake Hanoi, La Residence Hue, Victoria Hoi An Resort and Rennaissance Saigon) with abundant breakfasts in spacious, attractive restaurants and with large well apponted and comfortable rooms and friendly staff. The only disappointment in accommodation was the Prince II junk for our Halong Bay segment but this is not Buffalo Tours fault. The boat was smaller and in a bit rougher condition than we expected and there were some issues with bad odours coming from below decks. While the Prince ii may be considered Deluxe for Halong Bay it fell well short of that quality based on our experience with other cruises in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. However, the staff and food more than made up for the accommodations and we had a very good tour of Halong Bay.If you are considering touring Vietnam and want a stress free, informative, well guided trip then I gladly recommend using Buffalo Tours."

We paid $278 (256 Euro) for both of us (including transfers to and from our hotel in Hanoi, all meals while on board, and all activities from the boat, including kayaking, a cave tour, and of course, swimming). Drinks while on board are extra.The positives start with the prompt emails prior to the trip to explain all of the cruise options. From there, the pick-up at our hotel, the professional attitude of the driver, and wi-fi in the van on the way back (unfortunately not working on the way there) were also all very positive. The van, office at the dock, and cruise ship were all new and clean [boat operated by \"L'Azalee Cruises\" - we're not sure how they're connected to Buffalo Tours, but liked them - read on]. The office staff spoke great English, as did our host on board [all L'Azalee staff] . Our room was comfortable and clean. The room and bathroom were smallish by American standards, but comparable to what one might find at a hotel in Europe. The staff were absolutely great with our bags (hotel to van to ship and back again). And of course, the scenery in Halong Bay was spectacular.The negatives are fairly minor. As I mentioned, there was no wi-fi in the van on the way out to Halong Bay (but we weren't really expecting it anyway). When the cruise was over and the boat docked, we had to wait about 30 minutes before the van arrived to drive us back. However, one of the particularly entertaining, outgoing staff members entertained us with card tricks while we were waiting.Overall, we were very impressed with Buffalo Tours and would strongly recommend them."

Whilst I booked this tour with Travelsphere it was Buffalo Tours that saw us the whole way. There were buses, river trips, hotels and sightseeing, etc all to organise and it was done to perfection. The coach in Cambodia organised by our guide Sokkhoeun Bout was exceptionally comfortable and excellently, promptly and courteously driven by Mr Thoeun.Joey (Bangkok), Sokkhoeun (Cambodia) and Luki (HCMC) were all exceptional guides. Friendly, helpful, patient and informative.A great part of the world to visit and Buffalo Tours ensured and it was done hassle free for maximum enjoyment.The only suggestion I would make is that more time should have been given for Angor Wat in the itinerary on our particular trip. I'm pleased to say however Sokkhoeun took 3 of us back the following afternoon in his free time so that we could experience more. I thank him for this. I was travelling as a solo in a group of 13.Angie"

We were picked up by bus and bikes were provided. We rode a total of 420km along some of the nicest countryside in Vietnam and Cambodia. The organisation was excellent, good route, safe, fun, good food and drinks along the way. Good hotels each night, good restaurants for lunches and dinner. Informative guides Phuc and Vuttha. Riding around Angkor Wat was a treat, with expert commentary from Vuttha. In all such a great way to experience another culture at the ground level."

His name is Vuttha Dam. He is the best tour guide that I ever met. He is very knowledgeable about Cambodia (you ask any questions and you'll get the answers), professional and took great care of us. He made this trip smoother, easier and more exciting for us. Overall, I had a such great experience in Cambodia and couldn't ask any better.

Since everything was planned well and carried out smoothly. Zero stress meant I could enjoy my time here and experience what Cambodia had to offer. What prompted me to rate excellent was my phenomenal tour guide mr. Vuttha Dam. He was knowledgeable, extremely hard working, and one of the friendliest and most genuine human beings I have had the privilege to meet. He answered any questions I had, made everything flow that much smoother, maintained accountability of everyone in the group while also letting us wander around and do our own things. Another thing that I appreciated was how Vuttha was always on time with meet ups and appointments and would get down and dirty with us when we helped villagers farm and construct buildings. Because of Vuttha's outstanding initiative, customer service, and conduct, I would recommend going through buffalo tours and requesting him if you are planning a trip to cambodia. Our two bus drivers were also very hardworking and despite the chaotic traffic and rugged roads, I felt safe and in good hands throughout the trip and while commuting. The bus drivers would always assist the group with luggage, provide waters, and help Vuttha out if he needed. Our bus driver in Phnom Penh would dress up stylishly but was not afraid to get sweaty. He even help us deliver a three day supply of fruit to a hundred twenty kids at two different orphanages. Excellent job buffalo tours in hiring and assigning Vuttha and his support staff to make my time and experience in Cambodia awesome."

We booked our tour through Buffalo Tours, and I have to say that this company and our tour guide, Vuttha Dam, have been the best thing to happen to Cambodia tourism since it began! Vuttha is so genuinely caring, knowledgable and a wonderful person to be around. We toured all of the major tourist areas with Vuttha who gave us so much information about the history of the land as well as his own recounts growing up here as a young boy. He is prompt, honest, hardworking, genuine, and so positive about life. He had a wealth of knowledge and should be your guide of choice when you come to Cambodia! I would have never felt as safe or gained as much as I have, had we of had another tour guide. He is truly the best tour guide and person ever!! He is always looking out for us, our safety, our experience and our well being. He enriched our lives so much!! Buffalo tours does a fantastic job supporting him while he is with us. I hope they know what an incredible man they have working for them, he is the best representative of the country of Cambodia and the company. Thank you Vuttha!! #ieatsleepfood"

The driver seemed safe and generally smooth.The drive to the tunnels from our hotel was about 1\u00bd hours, with lots of traffic at the beginning. It was nice to see some peaceful countryside after breaking out of bustling Saigon. Chung knew a lot about the tunnels, and the pace of our visit to them was just about right. We left knowing more about the historic location and with respect for the creativity and perseverance of the Vietnamese who used it as their operations base.We would rather the tour not have included a stop at a \u201chandicapped\u201d craft factory. It was well out-of-the-way and added time to the tour that we would have preferred to put to another use. Worse was that the factory had the inevitable attached retail store.

HAI QUANG NGUYEN was our guide in Hue and Hoi An. As a former Monk he brought a different perspective and understanding of the ways of the Vietnamese people. This, combined with his historical knowledge, made for a wonderful experience. In Cambodia, VUTTHA DAM was our guide in Siem Reap and Angkor Wat. We were fortunate that he shared with us his personal experiences that brought home to us the suffering of the people throughout the years. In addition, his knowledge of the history of Cambodia was extensive and thorough. All of the above, served to fully enhance our trip beyond all expectations.

The experience was made truly wonderful by our exceptional Cambodian tour guide, Vutta. Knowledgeable, warm and completely delightful; he made the holiday great! A mention must also be given to our driver Nat who also provided a first class service. Cambodia is a stunning country and Cambodian people are truly beautiful. I will remember Angkor Wat forever."

After, this experience, I will not use any other travel agent to plan my trips. I have experienced the best. She made our entire experience a wonderful one and made us feel safe and secure and reassured over the entire process. Not only, did she do that, but she made the extra effort to personally greet us at our hotel even though that is not where her office is. Her planned tours worked to perfection throughout our stay. Fantastic job!!!!!!! Each place we visited that she planned turned out amazing and the planning was perfect. There was not a misstep the entire 2 weeks we were there. I would highly recommend using not only Buffalo Tours services, but I would not hesitate to ask for Trinh Thi Nhung as a personal trip planner. John B."

Vanessa in the Sydney office was great, she put an itinerary together, flights, hotels etc. We were met by smiling guides and received great service. We had 5 internal flights, a sprinkling of tours and time to relax. We also had perfect weather in November/December 2015. The Two night Ha Long Bay cruise was top quality a luxurious boat \"La Zalea\" , I think it was called, fantastic! Going to Vietnam? Talk to Buffalo!"

My wife and I just finished a nineteen day tour ( we were the only tour members) of Vietnam and Cambodia, arranged for us by Buffaloe Tours. If you are after an unique experience tailored for your specific preferences, and one in which all the logistics were taken care of, down to geeting you and seeing you off at the airports, I recommend this company. We had our own tour gudes, driver and car, and did not have to stand in lines to get into anything. The accommodations were four and five star rated, and quite luxurious. All of this was not cheap of course, but we feel well worth the price.When we travel abroad we enjoy seeing most of the standard tourist attractions, but are also interested in meeting people and learning all about their daily lives. Our tour guides ( there were five main ones, each in a different locale) were not only personable, knowledgeable, courtous, and responsible, but when asked, were very open about their own experiences and views. We came home with what we feel is a acccurate perspective on the state of affairs (both the good and bad) in each country. We also enjoy hiking and seeing the countryside, and were able to do this in the mountainous regions in northern Vietnam. We especailly recommend the day hikes among the H'mong villages - somewhat challenging ( on one day it rained most of the time) but rewarding. Concerning the countries themselves, we were surprised at how friendly and courteous the people were, and the degree of western influence. ( Christmas decorations were all up in the large cities.) The best parts were the rural areas in northern Vietnam near Sapa, Hue the old Imperial Capitol City, Halong Bay ( for an overnight cruise), Siagon ( more like a well-off western City than a poor Asian one), the countryside of the Mekong Delta, and the reconstructed Angkor complex in Cambodia. I would only briefly stay in Hanoi (which aside from the governmant complex did not offer much) and Hoi An - which was overcrowded and just one shop after another selling the same tourist stuff."

Tom the leader was friendly, funny, professional and very knowledgeable and helpful, with great English making my first trip to Vietnam most memorable.We crossed over into Cambodia and were met by Vuttha Dam with the big smiling face and respectful customary Cambodian greeting. Vuttha quickly informed us of what to expect, where we were going and lots of great insightful information about Cambodia, his home, which we soon found out he is very passionate about. With his team he quickly set us up on our new bikes and had us pedalling down the road.For the next week Vuttha assisted wonderfully by his team guided us south to north through Cambodia. Day after day and was wonderful information about Cambodia. Nothing was ever too much trouble for him, in fact, he was always doing extra and offering us stuff before we would even ask.Everything was organised beautifully with always too much food, may have put on a kilo even with all that cycling, oh well.The friendliness professionalism and enthusiastic personal knowledge Vuttha provided us over the week was definitely a highlight of this trip.Cannot recommend Vuttha his team and buffalo tours highly enough and certainly hope he will be leading the next trip I make to Cambodia. Thanks Vuttha, So (top guide, mechanic and person) and both drivers for a great time."

We visited 3 temples on a sweltering hot day in Siem Reap and by 2, and as spectacular as they are I'd had my fill of temples.

Great unplanned afternoon in the garden bar by the river watching the races having a beer or two. Would not hesitate using Buffalo tours again.

Vuttha was equally able to put down a challenge for the faster riders, as well as always caring for the slower ones. In fact, he and his team were very considerate, polite and always looking to assist. But he wasn't overly pushy as a guide, just the right amount of information at the appropriate time and that was very much appreciated. I always got the sense that I could ask Vuttha anything and everything and he would have the correct answer (to an historical question for example) or the most appropriate/useful suggestion (for shopping or a restaurant for example).

If you decide to make this trip, you will find it a privilege to have him as your guide."

            "review": "An Indochina tour of excellence, exhilaration, and magical moments. We wish to thank Buffalo Tours for all the arrangements associated with our 17 day \u2018one-to-one\u2019 tour in November 2015, covering Vietnam and, all-too-briefly, in Cambodia and Laos too. Everything was superbly delivered, from being greeted or sent on our way at airports, to the personal transportation and the quality accommodation provided. Above all, the holiday was greatly enhanced by each of our tour centre guides and their wealth of information given to us covering the broad range of sights visited, and not forgetting our courteous and skilled drivers too. Each day provided highlights, from the hustle and bustle of energetic city life in Hanoi and Saigon, to a water puppet show and the magical experience that was the cruise in Halong Bay; seeing the magnificent Angkor Wat monuments at Siem Reap; the sights and life along the Tonie Sap Lake and the Mekong delta boat trips; and the relaxing city of Luang Prabang. The Cu Chi tunnels, and the war remnants museum in Saigon were a sober reminder of the past. With visits to many museums, and temples and palaces such as that offered by the imperial city in Hue the memories will remain long into the future. Equally, the coastal and countryside beauty such as on the journey to Hoi An and much more were not to be missed. While everything went smoothly throughout we use the example of our Cambodia sector guide Mr Vottha and our driver Mr Det as examples of the quality services provided by all our guides and drivers throughout the trip, including guides Bruce Hoa (Hanoi) Johnny (Luang Prabang) and two others (apologies for not recording names) at centres in Vietnam. Mr Vottha greeted us, as if old friends, at the airport and over the next two days gave us detailed information on the country, its history and culture and of course a thorough explanation during our tour of the Angkor Wat complex. Our stay at the superb Navutu Dreams Resort near Siem Reap gave us time to relax at the pool side. Mr Vottha assisted us at every opportunity to ensure our stay was memorable, such as advising on getting to and from Siem Reap centre in the evenings. At all times, as elsewhere, our driver took great care to ensure a smooth journey from place to place, offering ample water supplies to counteract the heat. Our trip to the lake and villages along the shoreline and a small boat trip into the mangrove forest were memorable excursions, with Mr Vottha only too willing to assist us when getting on/off the boats \u2013 a delicate manoeuvre! The courteous and generous care for us given by our guides and drivers was an integral component of enjoyment of the holiday. Our one (small) regret, and all of our own doing, was that after the event we wished we had asked for and arranged more time, especially in Cambodia and Laos, especially to see a little more of the countryside or another centre. When accounting for time needed for packing/unpacking associated with each of the four international and two internal flights, coupled with the time taken to get to/from airports/hotels, and the airport waiting and flight durations, the time remaining within the 17 days for the itinerary trips in each centre, and for relaxing too, was significantly reduced!

A group of 7 Australian women used Buffalo Tours to arrange our entire trip excepting for a couple of hotel bookings.

We mostly arranged the hotels ourselves however Buffalo tours booked the 2 main city hotels for us. We also arranged just a driver and car for our time in Hoi Ann and this was perfect as we had someone at our beck and call the entire 3 days we were there. Our drivers and guides took us to good local places for meals when necessary and always made sure we were happy with the places they chose. We dealt with Hao in the office to arrange our trip and she was always very professional and very quick to reply to all our emails. This was truly an inexpensive way to arrange a great holiday - to be met and driven everywhere along the way and have our train tickets bought for us and be taken to the train etc was so much easier than trying to arrange all of this ourselves for 7 of us!Thank you Buffalo tours for providing us with excellent service for the 10 day trip."

Thank you to Sam. Thanks must also go to the two guides, I cannot remember their names, and also to the drivers of the tour bus, in our case, on all occasions, an eight person van. We were the only customers on the day of the tour to the tunnels, so we were pleased to receive a private and expert tour. Generally, even if you are the only customer requesting a tour on a specific day, you do not get asked to change the day, the tour will go ahead anyway and you have the pleasure of a private tour.The day tour to the Mekong was outstanding, cruising along the river in a small cane boat, to then transferring to the beautiful timber boat for a three course lunch. This country makes us feel, as Westerners, very humble indeed seeing how hard it is for the Vietnamese people to make a dollar, but always with a smile for you.Thank you so much to Buffalo Tours and to our guides and drivers, for making our stay very enjoyable."

            "review": "Amazing Charity Cycle Tour. I was part of a group of Australians and New Zealanders cycling Cambodia to raise money for charity. I had come to Cambodia expecting to be taken out of my comfort zone, having never travelled to Asia before. What I did not expect was to feel so completely at home, safe and cared for. We were accompanied by a local guide, Vuttha, and were also supported by a truck driver, coach driver and cycle mechanic. Nothing was too much trouble, and our every need was anticipated and met. When we were cycling the team rushed to provide us with snacks and water and to take care of our cycles at every break. Broken English was no barrier. We were given so much. Vuttha deserves a special mention. Obviously his English is excellent, which is necessary for a guide, however he is something truly special - a step above the other guides I observed during our travels. He is a one-man encyclopaedia - his knowledge of Cambodia astounding. Whether it be history, geography, politics, culture, food .... Vuttha was able to provide us with insight on it all. He did this with an amazing sense of humour and honesty. He led us to believe we were singularly important to him, and he even gave up his free day to accompany us in Phnom Penh. It was this step beyond his obligations as a guide that made us all appreciate and respect him so much.I would highly recommend touring Cambodia with Buffalo Tours, and with our Cambodian team."

He has a way of telling stories that engage you.. My first oversees trip in 30 years and Cycling in Cambodia has been the most rewarding, amazing adventure. Vuttah and his team, Sol, the bike mechanic, and En the patient, careful bus driver, and Mr Tohl, filled our water bottles and kept a wet scarf in the ice chest on the back of the truck enabling me cool down quickly in our rest breaks. They attended to our every need, and often seemed to know what we needed before we did!! From the frenetic streets of Siem Reap, to the meandering roads through the villages and to ancient temples we observed Cambodian life, not only from the seat of our bicycle, but hands on, in a rural community classroom, preparing food in a cooking school and participating in some farm activities. Thank You, Buffalo Tours for providing the most incredible Tour Guide, Vuttah, and his team. Highly recommend the trip and the team."

Mostly on good sealed roads we travelled through villages to observe what life is like for many Cambodians. Highlights of visits to the temple ruins, the cooking lunch class, the silk worm farm and community school were made even more special by the wonderful attention Vuttah and his team gave all of our group members. Vuttahs knowledge and hospitality he showed us all and every day was truly amazing, what a great guide! So ensured our bikes were adjusted the way we wanted and En was a very competent and patient bus driver negotiating the roads and highways we travelled along. Mr Tohl ensured our water supplies were always cold and topped up, we truly needed for nothing else the entire 10 days! Highly recommend a trip such as this and ensure you request Vuttah and his team as your guide and support crew!"

Incredibly knowledgable, great english, genuine, and humble. He went out of his way time and time again to make sure we were looked after.The team included a bus driver, truck driver and a cyclist/mechanic to support us. Although language (broken english) may have been a barrier, it was quickly broken thanks to the kind gestures of all three (and help interpretting from Vuttha).As a group they were fantastic, Vuttha even gave up his day off to guide us round Phnom Penh during our 'free day'. I would insist on asking for Vuttha and his team if you are ever booking tours or trips around Cambodia and I can't wait to go back to see them all again one day."

Our guides, Nicky and Net, we're amazing and worked incredibly well with our group of 28 year eight students from Australia. We did a tuk tuk tour of the temples of Chiang Mai, explored night markets, went to a great, ethical elephant camp, and made early morning alms offerings to monks. Our accommodation was well above what we expected for both quality and location, and Buffalo organised it all for incredibly competitive prices. We look forward to utilising their services for our schools next trip in 2016."

We had one free day in our recent trip to Hanoi, so my wife booked us and two of her colleagues on a Buffalo Tours day trip to Ninh Binh Province, which included visiting the ancient capital city at Hoa Lu and the temples at Tam Coc. What a great day! Our guide picked us up at our hotel and we were escorted via a very comfortable van to our destination. Be warned they are going to stop at predetermined roadside tourist shops where you are encouraged to but something - art, clothes, trinkets, jewelry, etc - from the locals. The pressure isn't too bad so just go with it and enjoy the experience. Our guide Son was really informative and pleasant to talk to during the trip and incredibly helpful in navigating the more high pressure sales pitches that came later at Tam Coc and during our boat ride on the Boi River. Our boat driver was particularly pushy so I was glad Son had prepped us on how to handle the tips, etc. As it is I gave her twice the amount he suggested - and she still seemed miffed at me. Oh well, the stunning beauty of the river was worth it. Getting there also included a long bike ride down some back roads and through villages most tourists would never see any other way. All in all, it was a great day trip and I would recommend it to anyone."

We booked this day tour with Buffalo Tours through our hotel in Ho Chi Minh City because we wanted to do a bit of exploring by bike outside the city. It was a full day with a great guide, Phuc Le, who was very informative about all aspects of Vietnamese history, language and customs. There were 3 of us - myself, my wife and our grandson, aged 11. We started off at 8am and drove for about an hour down towards the delta and then rode on mountain bikes provided by Buffalo Tours from Tan An through paddy fields and villages for about 30km. It was mainly flat so not challenging cycling but it was great to be out in the Vietnamese countryside. Our guide knew a lot about rice production and the other crops that we passed as his family were farmers. It was a very hot day so 30km was about right for the cycling and we then visited a pagoda and had a boat trip before an excellent lunch with local specialities. We then went on to visit a place where they were producing honey and another producing coconut sweets, had a ride in a horse and cart and a trip in a canoe. A really full day of activities where you get a taste of the area as well as cycling around areas that you won't reach by car. A very enjoyable day out."

It was like being with a friend after a long time.

Anan guided us through the market advising where and where not to purchase items.

Our first guide was Vira in Phenon Pen.Exceptional, I have never had anyone who delivered top service on a tour I have been on. Nothing was too much trouble.Then in Siem Reap we had Den as driver and Sokkhoeun as our guide.Another exceptional experience from both of them.I am humbled to receive service that was beyond my expectations.I have travelled extensively and can say no one has ever come to the standard I experienced.Highly recommend."

We had our own tour guide and he made the day so much better as he assissted with anything he could from local knowledge...making sure our kids did slip as it was rainy.... and helping the grandparents up the steaper areas. Nothing was to much trouble and he was always watching. Vuttha Dam was one of the best guides we have experienced and we travel a lot. Thank you!"

After a delay due to the weather the flight departing HCMC was delayed but over 2 hours. When we got to Da Nang they weren't there. Rang and the lady (who was very polite) said she would ring and call back. Excuse was they didn't know what flight we had changed to - sorry! No flight change. She asked us to get a taxi. At least one other family standing there waiting for Buffalo Tours and no show to their resort either. Whilst not a complete disaster after long flights, long delays and bad weather this was not what we were expecting. Hope that they lift their game as this is really bad. Would avoid next time."

Fantastic country, made special for us by excellent guides and faultless transfers. Special shout to Karen in the London office for arranging the schedule taking into account everything we wanted to do.We went from Hanoi to Ha Long bay, onward to Hue and Hoi An and finally to Ho Chi Mihn city. We had warned the kids the hotels were likely to be 'rustic' but every one superseded our expectations. The guides (a different one in each city) were punctual, friendly and reliable and spoke excellent English. There was no guided visits to hard sell factories. That is not to say we were not taken to craft/art places but always on our terms and when offered. We bought lots. Excellent quality and good prices with shipping home offered.The country is wonderful and I could fill chapters with that. Food was amazing. All I can offer is that we preferred the north, though Hoi An at night is heart-achingly beautiful.For far East I would thoroughly recommend this company."

            "review": "Buffalo Tours Cambodia. We spent 3 fabulous days in Siem Reap this August with our amazing Buffalo Tour guide Sokhoeun Bout. From the minute he collected us at airport in a country we have never been before, his friendly manner and good sense of humour immediately put us at ease and we knew we would have a great time. Over the 3 days we visited the temples (Angkor Tom, Bayon, Ta Prohm, Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei and Banteay Sambre) and his in-depth knowledge of each site, their history and their importance that extends to today were second to none. His passion and enthusiasm for his country, its history and its future development were inspiring and we learnt an incredible amount from him in our short trip. His excellent photography skills and his avoidance of other tourists meant we had the best holiday pics ever; so many perfect shots that did not have a single tourist in despite being main tourist attractions (this would never have happened without a guide). Prior to our own visit to the market, he advised us on the best way to barter and ensure we were not ripped off which proved to be very sound advice and we came home with lots of lovely souvenirs! On the last day when I was not feeling well (stomach ache) he was very kind and offered me health advice and when I was feeling better and ready to go, Sokhoeun had kindly re-arranged our itinerary to account for lost time so we did not miss out on anything. What we liked most about Sokhoeun was that he was tuned in to our interests and focussed on the type of holiday we wanted. Also throughout our tour, Sokhoeun and our lovely smiley driver ensured that whatever the weather we were always prepared with sun cream, insect repellent, water, wipes and even umbrellas! I\u2019m sure that Buffalo Tour Guides are all excellent but if you are going to Siem Reap definitely ask for Sokhoeun as I am sure this will enhance your experience of Cambodia-a massive thank you Sokhoeun!"

We booked our tailor-made 22 day tour of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos on-line through the Hanoi Head Office and were most impressed with the efficiency and helpfulness of the staff there (two ladies both called Thu). Buffalo Tours organised all our transportation, by both air and road, accommodation, and a driver and personal guide at each stop. Without exception the guides were first class, the vehicles comfortable and the drivers charming and courteous (the ice cold water and cold wipes most welcome in the heat). All the hotels were excellent. What made this holiday so special was the warmth, friendliness and genuine desire of all the guides to enlighten us in an incredibly informative and interesting way about each place we visited. Cambodia was my personal highlight - with Sokhoeun Bout guiding us through the amazing temples of Angkor, in Siem Reap. His extensive knowledge was quite outstanding. If you are going to Siem Reap, try and ask for him personally. In Pnom Penh, Khuon was the expert guide to the Killing Fields and the Genocide Museum. In Laos, the guides were Seng (Vientiane) and Phet (Luang Prabang). Again first class. In Vietnam, Trang (Hanoi), Thach (Hoi-An and Hue) and Tin (Ho Chi Minh City) were excellent. I have no hesitation in recommending Buffalo Tours to anyone travelling to this area and would most certainly use them again."

The Buffalo Tour Company were excellent!We began by using their suggested tour of the two countries and then through a series of e-mails tailor made it to meet our own requirements. The company even managed to ensure that we had a good deal on the flight to and from HK at the beginning and end of the tour to Vietnam and Cambodia.We visited Hanoi, including a one night cruise on Halong Bay, Hue, Hoi An, Ho Chi Minh City, Phnom Pen and Siem Reap. Apart from the transfer by car between Hue and Hoi An, we flew between the other cities. The organisation was excellent. Hotels were all of a pleasing standard, comfortable, clean , well located. All the hotel staff were friendly , welcoming and helpful. The hotel staff and the guides recommended some excellent restaurants wherever we stayed. All very different but equally good.Breakfast was of a good if not excellent standard in all the hotels we chose. We didn't experience any stomach upsets or illness the whole time we were away.We were met from each airport by a guide from Buffalo, the cars were air conditioned,well maintained and clean.Water and handwipes available at all times. The drivers everywhere were confident and courteous. The guides all spoke english well. They were friendly and welcoming, always mindful of our well being. They were extremely informative and we learnt a great deal from them not only about the places we visited but about the local culture. All admission fees to the places of interest were included in the total price which made for queue free days, The guides were also knowledgeable about the best times to visit and the best photo opportunities! The guides were all very different characters but good company.We enjoyed all aspects of our tour but especially the cruise on the Red Dragon Junk on Halong Bay, the street food in Hanoi, the Imperial City in Hue and the pretty port of Hoi An. A tour of the Vietcong tunnels was a disturbing experience as was the visit to the Genocide museum and the Killing Fields in Phnom Penh but not to be missed. Angkor Wat was a fitting way to end the tour, the beauty of the temples, contrasting with the natural beauty of the bay that we began with.Favourite hotels were the boutique hotels: Ancient House Resort in Hoi An; White Mansion Hotel in Phnom Penh and the Sokkah Boutique Resort in Siem Reap.Restaurants that were recommended and particularly good were: Malis and Sugar Palm in Phnom Penh; Cargo Club in Hoi An and the \"sister\" restaurant to the Sokkah Boutique hotel in Siem Reap.A memorable trip made so by the fantastic organisation and the people that we met."

She was excellent to work with and was most helpful in designing a memorable trip. We started in Saigon and moved north through Vietnam before travelling to Luang Prabang. The guides and drivers in all of our destinations were first rate and they made sure that we truly enjoyed our time. We had a good mix of time with experienced guides as well as free time to experience places on our own at our own pace. Our time at a home stay in the Mekong Delta as well as the Halong Bay cruise were particularly memorable. Luang Prabang was magical and was perfect in every way as well. I should note that the guides did an excellent job tailoring their work to interest my son as well. Yao in HCMC in particular went above and beyond to engage and develop a relationship with my son.Overall, Buffalo Tours is an excellent operator and I would highly recommend their services.

Buffalo Tours did a fantastic job arranging my three day trip. They assigned me a guide, Vuttha Dam, and driver, Sarith, who picked me up from the airport and shuttled me all over the province. Vuttha was very professional and timely and pleasant. He was informative about the country and sites we visited as well as a good conversationalist. And although Sarith did not speak English very well, he made every effort to make sure I was comfortable throughout my trip. These guys are the best and made my trip very memorable! I am so grateful!"

Vuttha Dam our guide in Cambodia is a joy to work with, his knowledge is excellent and his passion and enthusiasm for his country is infectious. Teamed up with Si Phat, a great driver, I couldn't have asked for more from them and they always went the 'extra mile' for the group. As we moved to the south of Vietnam, our guide was Laki, another super guide, full of information, great rapport and an absolute pleasure to work with. They will all rate alongside my other favourites, Sokkhoeun Bout and Hoang Ngoc Loc. Thanks Buffalo and I look forward to the next time"

Their pricing is a little high compared to other companies but I feel you get what you pay for.

My family and I have just returned from my second journey through Buffalo Tours and on both counts I could not be more pleased or grateful for the wonderfully meaningful experiences and excellent care.I am 31+ weeks pregnant and traveled, along with my husband and 3-year old daughter, to Siem Reap, Cambodia as both my husband and I have always wanted to visit the temples in the area. It was a very special family vacation undertaken prior to the birth of our second child. Buffalo Tours was exceptional every step of the way and we all had an incredible time. Our guide for the 4-day visit was Mr. Thy Soeun and from the moment he greeted us at the airport with a big smile, we knew we were in excellent care. We felt very safe and well-cared for in each excursion and in each vehicle (tuk tuk, van, and boat). Mr. Thy was very accommodating and adjusted our daily schedules with graceful ease depending on the needs of our daughter and myself to ensure that we each and all had our needs and travel wishes met. We visited six temples over the course of our stay and he was incredibly knowledgeable about teaching us about each one ~ and we never felt rushed in our experiences. He also offered us opportunities to experience other aspects of the city and area. It was the perfect blend of relaxed enjoyment and well-organized guidance. We stayed at the Victoria Hotel, which was also ideal for us. My daughter has severe food allergies and the staff were understanding and accommodating in meeting our needs, with the chef prepared safe foods for her as we requested. Our room was very clean and comfortable and we all slept and ate very well and enjoyed the pool and ambiance very much. I am not exaggerating when I say that this was the best family vacation we have experienced. My first trip through Buffalo Tours was a 10-day, highly customized, tour of Central and South Vietnam with my mother, who was visiting from the United States and not very comfortable with international travel. Not only did our guides and drivers take us to every place that we requested (and sometimes only had photos and notes regarding), but we felt safe and comfortable the entire time as well. Our main guide was Thong Nguyen Cong, who was an absolute treasure in personality and in all of the effort and information that he shared with us. He was tireless in ensuring a deeply fulfilling and comfortable trip for us both. Each of the hotels that we stayed in were clean and comfortable and the restaurants that we ate at were also clean and had wonderful fresh food. It was an ideal blend of meeting our very specific personal requests, as well as introducing us to countless other fascinating aspects of the areas that we traveled through. It was a journey that both my mother and I will remember with gratitude always and one that continues to stand out among my very best travel experiences."

If, like me, you have only one day to visit Cambodia, then I strongly urge you to find the fantastic Mr Sokvichet Chin of Buffalo Tours, known simply as \"Chet\" - a truly exceptional tour guide, He knows his subject inside out and I spent a fascinating and unforgettable day in his friendly and knowledgable company looking around some of the most spectacular sights on earth: the amazing \"Tomb Raider\" Ta Prohm temple huge trees supporting the crumbling stones, peaceful and beautiful Bayon with rows and rows of smiling Buddha faces on towers and exquisite bas reliefs, the incredible palace complex with the famous Elephant Terrace, and world heritage site Angkor Wat itself. An unmissable experience. The temple complex is vast and extremely beautiful, surrounded by lush jungle guarded by monkeys and thousands of exotic butterflies. There is a palpable sense of holiness in these ancient places. Chet gave me many insights into contemporary Cambodian life through its long and often troubled history, and his expertise as a photographer came in very handy for finding the best places for shots. He also knew how to avoid the crowds - so I got to see the highest temple in the centre without having to queue- and could recommend all the best places in town to eat and relax after sight seeing in the heat. Cool water and shade was always to hand and I felt beautifully looked after. For a single woman travelling alone in Asia this was a fantastic experience in every way. Highly recommended."

Keoun, my driver, was very attentive without being overbearing which is a very difficult skill to master. His driving always felt safe and he was always focused. Another area to note was that he was ready with a cold water whenever you needed one, which is all you want in the heat and humidity of tropical Cambodia.The major key to the success of this tour was my tour guide, Vuttha Dam. He has the perfect balance of knowledge, personality, humor and customer service that there was no part of the tour that was less than exceptional thanks to him. Unlike many tour guides who come across as reciting a script, Vuttha was so personable in relaying information with ease that I felt it was as if it were more conversational in tone; he was never talking at me but always to me. He was very generous in allowing me to go at the pace that suited me and it was very evident that he wanted this to be the best experience for me as possible. I would highly recommend anyone who wants more than the standard tour to take this Temple Tour and, if at all possible, ask for Vuttha as a guide."

We were shown to our private car and introductions were made on the 10 minute drive to the Angkor Wat sunrise viewing point. Our guide settled us at a prime location and we watched the dark images take the shape of the famous temples as the sun rose. We chose to take a breakfast basket from the hotel so we did not need to leave the temples and instead picnicked on the remnents of one of Angkor Wat's libraries - so amazing.Mr Bunvath then walked us through Angkor Wat temples before moving onto Angkor Thom. At no point did we feel rushed or hurried as our patient guide allowed us frequent photo opportunities and regaled us with detailed stories of the temples, their history and their cultural significance.Lunch was provided at a local restaurant and the traditional Khmer food did not dissapoint.From here we drove to a third temple complex, Ta Prohm, or the jungle temple (made famous by Angelina Jolie in the movie Tomb Raider). This was truly stunning, the green jungle enveloping the remnents of the ancient temple, and trees growing in and around the foundations, made for a visually spectacular sight.To round out the day, we finished with a gentle gondola ride up the moat surrounding Angkor Thom.I cannot recommend Buffalo Tours highly enough, nor the courteous, informative and patient guides. Had we chosen not to do the private tour I am sure we would have missed out on so much of the minute detail hidden in the temples and been poorer for not learning about the amazing history of Cambodia first hand."

Amy took us to local markets and helped us find souvenirs outside the touristy spots in local markets etc. She was also well prepared to take us to nice Thai Vegetarian restaurants to keep us satiated through out. Particularly good were the Vegetarian Slow Restaurant inside a monastry and a chef owned restaurant that serves only vegetarian food (blanking out on the name now).Our last stop Bangkok was equally memorable even though we felt it was a bit too much city-ish for our tastes. Nevertheless, we got to enjoy the local delicacies (vegetarian ones ofcourse) like the grilled coconut and coconut palm sugar etc. Our tour guide Wanna, just like the other guides from Buffalo Tours, was very accommodative of our requests and helped us find local items that we could use back in our home - like a coconut scraper, garland making needle etc.. :-)..Over all, our experience with Buffalo Tours and the Guides Sokhoeun in Cambodia, Amy and Wanna in Thailand was very memorable and very personable. I'd recommend Buffalo Tours for your South Asian vacation needs for a neatly laid out and well planned and worry free vacation."

An air conditioned car and a most informative guide Sokhoeun Bout. This made our day an amazing experience. We were well looked after and well informed as we explored the ancient temples. After our exploration of the temples we were taken to a great restaurant where we enjoyed a very tasty lunch, it was all laid on. We would highly recommend buffalo tours and to ask for Sokhoeun as your guide."

Initially I thought the tour guide was adequate because I did not have anything to compare it to, until I went on another half day city tour for $30. Not only am I highly disappointed, I feel duped . Firstly, the guide kept answering her phone and explained by telling me her brother has cancer and she is the only who know how to care for him , not what you want to hear while on vacation. This set the mood for the entire day and I kept hearing more about how difficult it is for her brother and her family. I was sympathetic but again not something I wanted to hear since it was this same time last year a very close friend of mine died of cancer. While at the ethology museum she told me to explore on my own in one of the rooms and I heard her on her phone outside again. I also found her very bias towards the other ethnic group because she kept comparing them to the Viet group, which is her ethnicity. She kept referring to them as \"simple, not like the Viet.\" She also took me to some very expensive gifts shops instead of the regular gift shops because she said the products are \"low quality\", I wish she would let me decide that for myself. My tour also did not last the 7hrs and 30mins as advertised, left the hotel at 8 and was dropped off around 2, without the Cyclo ride. What was even more disappointing not to mention demoralizing was that she cut short the visit to the temple of literature. I was able to find this out because I went on another private tour and was able to see and be better informed about the entire place not just the 1st section. Yes, she only took me to the first half of the temple. She also was not very informative at Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake and Ngoc Son Temple which again I found out on my 2nd tour. If I never took the 2nd tour I would have missed out on a lot of Vietnamese history and culture and that defeats the purpose of a guide. This also made me question what else was cut short and was not informed of. She also had me take a survey while sitting next to me which did not allow for complete honesty."

It was worth doing but I concur with others' feedback that paying extra for photos is not very good value for money.What made this tour exceptional for me was the outstanding service of \"twan\" (not sure of spelling). The purpose of my trip to Vietnam was to go to my brother's wedding (he is marrying a Vietnamese girl). I had mentioned to twan about getting a dress made so after the puppet show, he took me to a dress maker to get a traditional long dress made for the occasion. He did all of the translating to make it all happen smoothly.If that wasn't enough, because I wasn't sure where to go or what to order, he then took me to a pho place and helped order food for me before returning me to the hotel. Absolutely outstanding service. His English was fantastic and a fabulous sense of humour. Having had a rough day after a very long and tiring flight, Twan's fantastic service was exactly what I needed to get my Vietnam holiday off to a brilliant start."

We did a two week trip visiting Bangkok, Chang Mai, Phuket, and Ko Samui. We loved Thaialnd and the people were so welcoming and friendly it really added to our trip.To start with all of the buffalo tours staff was extremely polite, professional and informative. All the transfers were on time and easy to find and all the excursion except for 1 we really enjoyed (I will get to the one we didn't like in a bit). I want to give a special shout out to our Chiang Mai tour guide Kitty. He was amazing and was by far the best buffalo tour employee we dealt with. He went above and beyond to really add to our honeymoon experience and he deserves special acknowledgement for that. As mentioned previously we really enjoyed all but 1 of our tours/excursions. Our favorites being the full day trip to Chiang Mai village, eating with the local walking through the forest all that was amazing. We also loved our phi phi island day excursion. The company used for that was great and really made sure everyone onboard enjoyed themselves. However, we did not enjoy our angthong marine park join in tour. I was really disappointed by this because we heard such great things but based on the itinerary we were provided we felt cheated we didn't get what we paid for. To start the tour guides for this trip got very frustrated with some of the people on the boat and that but a damper on everything about the day. They only allowed us to snorkel for 10-15 minutes on our first stop. After calling us on the boat we stopped at the marine park view point again only being about 20 minutes which was just enough time to get to top viewpoint get a couple pictures before we were rushed to the boat again. Also the itinerary we were provided said we would ride a long tail boat which never happened. Kayaking was a joke as we were given only 20 minutes to kayak and were never even told about the other viewpoint near the kayaking area which was also mentioned in our buffalo tour itinerary. This was a waste of our time and money which really is a shame because the location were beautiful but we weren't allowed to enjoy them.Back to the positives. The hotels that were chosen for us were great. The rooms, staff and locations were simply amazing. Each room we had received had a honeymoon note or gift for us something my wife really enjoyed. Bottom line buffalo tours did a great job organizing everything for us. We were sad to leave Thailand. It is an amazing country and buffalo tours did a professional job for us."

Yann was very knowledgable and having him taking us around really made the visits to the temples very special indeed, I would definitely recommend booking a tour through Buffalo Tours it was fantastic. Having a private tour was brilliant as we could talk to Yann and Det to tailor what we saw and how long we spent at each temple, this is definitely the way to go to get the most of your visit to the Angkor temples do yourselves a favour and book Buffalo Tours if you are visiting Siem Reap."

He was very knowledgeable about everything and we both felt we learned more from Quang about Vietnam (including the war) than we ever had prior. The tour was about $50US a person for half day but we definitely felt like we got our money's worth! Would definitely use buffalo tours for future visits! Thanks Quang!"

I highly recommend Laki in HCMC (Saigon). He is wonderful! So personable, helpful, and intelligent, plus his English was some of the best I heard in Vietnam. He warned us if something was unsafe and he seemed to genuinely care. In Hanoi we had Rosie who was also a wonderful English speaker and a great guide. In Cambodia we had Nak - very patient, intelligent, and good English. When we arrived in Cambodia someone with the visa agency took care of all of our paperwork and made the visa process flow smoothly, and then he delivered us to Nak. I know we probably paid a premium for Buffalo Tours' service, but definitely worth it. It was nice knowing that a reliable company would meet us at the airport/hotel each time we needed transportation. Plus they provided a van with good air and cold water (much needed in the heat in May). They also recommended a certain hotel to us that we loved (Victoria Angkor Wat in Cambodia). 5 stars all around!"

He has a wealth of knowledge that he shared with all of us about the Angkor Wat temples, the Buddhist religion in Cambodia, social life of Cambodians, and history of the country and its development. Vuttha was more than just our tour guide, he became a good friend to all of us on the trip, and we all had so much fun hanging out with him when we had free time.

She carefully planned our entire trip to meet our personalized needs. She answered our multitude of pre-trip questions promptly and cheerfully. Every question was answered within a day! All her answers were correct and her suggestions were extemely useful. We couldn't have had a better person to arrange our trip! Lastly, her knowledge of written and spoken English was excellent.The trip itself exceeded all our expectations. Each tour guide and driver met all our needs. Every event we planned went off without a hitch. Their knowledge of the sites we visited and the country culture and social structure was very informative.Lastly, Ms. Huong personally met us near the end of our trip in Hanoi and presented us with some beautiful Vietnamese made gifts.We highly recommend Buffalo Tours and Ms. Huong in particular if you plan to visit any of the ten countries in Asia that Buffalo services."

Thanks to our Buffalo Tours tour guide, Vuttha Dam, myself and 7 seven students were able to learn firsthand how Cambodians live on a daily basis, how their current lives have been impacted by their recent and distant history, and how their customs and values determine the interactions we\u2019ve enjoyed with the Khmer people.Vuttha has served as far more than a tour guide. Not only does he have a scholarly understanding of Khmer history and culture, but he is able to place it into a Southeast Asian and international context. His appreciation for classical Khmer history, art, and culture is also matched by his knowledge of popular and modern Khmer society. Students gained a rich and profound appreciation for the country and its past, present, and future. Vuttha\u2019s ability to communicate this knowledge should not be underestimated. He is very sensitive to the fact that Westerners may not be familiar with the culture and demonstrates a cross-cultural competence that is rare in the service industry. Vuttha is a professional and consistently goes beyond\u2014way beyond\u2014what is necessary to provide clients with the best possible experience; and he does so with grace and skill. Above all, Vuttha has demonstrated what it means to be an ambassador for his country and culture. Everything the students and I have learned and experienced has been enhanced many times as a result of Vuttha\u2019s friendship, skills, and professionalism. We will never be able to separate our Cambodian experience from Vuttha\u2019s outstanding performance. Aw koon cheran, Vuttha!"

The itinerary was fine - liked the boat cruise from Cai Be. The first day lunch was amazing at an old colonial house surrounded by beautiful gardens. The food was excellent (if too much for one person). Stopping by the \"home factories\" was very interesting too. The second day activities were also good but would note that if you go in May, it may not be worthwhile to go to Tra Su Forest as the water level is very low & there's not much wildlife. If you do book this be warned that the two lunches included are both set menus which is way too much food & the second day lunch spot repeated dishes from the first day but not to the same level of quality so it was a bit disappointing. The other issue is that the guide seemed to be very concerned as to why I was traveling alone & t bringing up why I was traveling alone & telling me I would have more fun if I traveled with other people. It was really annoying & put me off, particularly as I'm a single female traveling alone! Would recommend Buffalo Tours but only if you're traveling in a group. The driver was very good & never once caused me any concern."

This is a warning about the guide who took my husband and I on this tour in April while we were guests at the Victoria Sapa Resort. I decided to use Buffalo Tours as they seemed to be endorsed by the resort with a desk in the hotel lobby.The booking process was very smooth and helpful and I commend Ms Trang for her efficiency and friendliness.However on the morning of the tour the guide, Vung, arrived 15 minutes late and worse was either very hungover or drunk still from his birthday party the night before which he gleefully told us about. He smelled very badly of alcohol and we were immediately concerned about his fitness for the days tour.As the driver (who was very professional and efficient) seemed to be ok we set off with some reservation but hopeful that the state of the guide's sobriety would be quickly amended. However this was not to be. I have listed below the things he said and did throughout the day which left us feeling extremely vulnerable and upset by his extremely inappropriate behaviour.1. Before leaving Sapa town he asked what the itinerary was as he 'had no idea'. As we did not have it written down he made several phone calls to find out where he was supposed to be taking us.2. He made crude comments, swore, made rude hand gestures and acted very strangely all day3. He cancelled the river trip as the water was too low but also cancelled the local restaurant lunch - he took us on a boat on the lake instead & gave us fruit; he casually asked if we wanted to visit a local village but never made any attempt to arrange this; however by that time we were very concerned about our personal safety and had quietly asked the driver to make sure we went straight back to Sapa as soon as possible with no side trips4. He repeatedly touched my nose, face & hair, put his arm around me, dragged me away from my husband by the arm several times and was seen by my husband leering at me5. He made repeated personal comments about our appearance - hair & faces6. He repeatedly asked us to drink beer & \"happy water\"7. He berated us for not going trekking the day before & told us we wouldn't see the real Sapa if we didn't walk out of the hotel 8. He wanted us to go to his home for a meal that night & when we said no thanks he berated us for \"wanting 5 star meals & not getting to know the locals\"9. He lectured us about Viet politics, corruption, the government & his personal political beliefs10. He wanted to take us trekking along the riverbank for no obvious reason11. He spent lots of time buying a fish for his personal consumption and to take in the car to Sapa then he got a live rooster which he intended taking back to Sapa untethered and in an open box in the car with us - I told him I was scared of live, large birds so he made other arrangements12. He spend ages on his phone taking calls & texts organising other business & then telling us about how much he was charging, how amazing he was, how important clients were willing to pay anythingAll in all it was an extremely unpleasant, uncomfortable experience which we would never wish to have happen to anyone else. To make the situation even more uncomfortable we learnt his wife is the lovely lady who works at the tour desk in the hotel. I cannot express seriously enough our concern and extreme disappointment that we paid for a tour which we anticipated being very enjoyable but which was so unpleasant."

There was a mix up with pick up - wrong hotel, so we got off to a delayed start.Our guide 'Tony' was most apologetic and off we set.our driver for the day was also Tony, so that made it easy.First stop was Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum - most impressive.Uncle Ho still resting peacefully under heavy guard. Greatly revered by the Vietnamese people. Queues snake for probably - 1 km! We thankfully went on a quiet day. Queuing in the heat and humidity would be almost prohibitive. The tour only operates daily from 7:30-11:30 so you need to plan around that. It is a highlight. It's closed from Sept - Nov when Uncle Ho gets a makeover - 'somewhere'. Our guide said it was I quite a highly kept secret - where he goes during those 3 months! The gardens & residences including the Pagoda are well worth wandering around. We spent around 75 mins there in all.Next stop was the Museum of Ethnicity - interesting but overwhelmingly HOT. We needed to get through quickly and moved on to the Temple of Literature. Very pretty and interesting. Home of Confucius. Beautifully pretty at night - full of lanterns and twinkling lights.Next stop - lunch in the old quarter. Set menu 4 courses in a fairly commercially tourist Resturant. Nice to sit in an air conditioned building . Food was ok and the beer cold.( drinks at our cost). The Tonys ate separately - somewhere. After lunch was a 1 hour rickshaw ride! Scary but fun. 2 lovely drivers who happily pointed out buildings of interest and happily prompted my husband and I at every photo opportunity. We met up again with Tony and proceeded to the Temple on the lake. By now we were really overheated and keen to return to our hotel. We skipped the water puppets because we were due to be collected again for an evening tour and certainly needed a shower.Great day - tipped the Tonys and paid the rickshaw drivers - everything else ( all entries) covered in the day tour cost.Overall - worth doing."

Her knowledge of the city and it's history was amazing. It was just the 2 of us on this tour and nothing was too much trouble for her. Seeing the city and having a local explain it's history was amazing. It was a brilliant day. I would highly recommend Buffalo Tours and if you are looking to do the Saigon City Full Day tour ask for Miss Lam to be your guide. You won't be disappointed."

The team there did a great job, special thanks should go to Rhea for her patience and expertise as we had many questions and concerns. The team were always friendly, very prompt with their replies and their advice was brilliant.At every location we were met by very experienced tour guides, everyone spoke excellent English and the vehicles were all of a high standard with 'air conditioning'. We took Buffalo's advice with hotels and were blown away, the quality of each was exceptional and we received a free upgrade in Saigon to a full suite.We did have one problem , where a river cruise could not take place due to the water level falling too low. To be fair Buffalo warned us that this may happen before we departed, but they were prompt to call us in advance and ready with a number of alternative options, including a full refund for that trip. In the end we asked for a meal at the best restaurant in town and they came back in 30 minutes and had booked the top table.All round the best holiday we have had in years.Very happy to recommend Buffalo to anyone.The highlight was Siem Reap in Cambodia"

            "review": "Great reliable service. My husband & I made our own itinerary around Vietnam during the 12 days we were here. But we used the Buffalo guides & cars several times within this.They were a pick up & drop off cars for all our airport/hotel connections. They never kept us waiting & all the cars were very clean & modern. Our greeters were friendly & helpful and all the drivers were safe and considerate. On reflection we could have made our own way to & from the airports more cheaply by local taxis but the ease & convenience of pre-booking & paying was worth it. I'm sure the extra money made by Buffalo tours this way goes to paying their staff well & maintaining their fleet of vehicles at a high standard.We also used Buffalo tours for a half day trip in Saigon to visit Cu Chi Tunnels. It was great to have a private guide to take us around here instead of being part of one of the bigger groups being herded through this very touristy site.In Hanoi, we again used Buffalo tours to visit Halong Bay. Their sister company is the L'Azalee cruises - a fleet of about 5 boats - a 12 berth, a couple of 2 berths, a private one berth boat and a brand new day boat. We decided to do a 3 day/2 night cruise after reading various reviews on TripAdvisor. We're so glad we did as the middle day of the trip on the day boat is the one that really makes the whole thing magical.The staff were fabulous the entire trip. And the food was mostly amazing (I was a little disappointed at some of the western dishes provided. All the Vietnamese meals were delicious, but I would have preferred pho or something similar instead of pumpkin soup. And I do not need or want chips at the best of times! Part of the reason I chose to visit Vietnam was to eat the local food - by the by the spring rolls were amazing, the mango salad delicious & the spicy beef skewers yummy.) The tour was very well organised, very efficient, but allowing for oodles of lovely relaxing time to take in the view, peace & quiet.Although I understand the need for the fairly tight schedule, activities like the morning trip to the Hang Sung Sot become a rushed, herded rather surreal experience as the 30 or so boats moored in the bay overnight race out their tenders full of passengers between 7:30-8:00 am to visit the cave. We all get crushed at the gate, wait in lines & walk very slowly through each cavern with a mass of others...& by 8:30 there is no-one at the entrance...we're all at the other end being herded back onto our tenders through hordes of others being herded onto their tenders.Obviously Halong Bay, like Cu Chi Tunnels have become very touristy. However Halong Bay still has a magical, mystical charm if you have the time to spend a few days there to get away from the crowded areas. Thank you Buffalo Tours & L'Azalee for helping to make our time in Vietnam so memorable."

Both of our Buffalo tour guides, Loc in Vietnam and Vuttha in Cambodia, were absolutely fantastic. They both possessed an exuberance and enthusiasm for their respective countries which they were keen to share with all of us. Their passion to impart their knowledge contributed greatly in making my trip the most amazing holiday I've ever been on. Rob our tour guide, who looked after us for the whole 3 weeks, was efficient, organised and entertaining and deserved a medal for remaining so calm whenever things didn't go quite according to plan. What was most impressive was the ability for all three of them to be flexible on the itinerary which was required in both countries due to extremes of weather. Altogether a fantastic experience and if I knew anyone was going to Vietnam or Cambodia I would most definitely recommend they contact Buffalo Tours and ask for Loc and Vuttha."

From Hanoi to Hue and Hoi An to Saigon and overnight on the Mekong - a kaleidoscope of sensory experiences embracing sights, smells, tastes and noise! Particular credit goes to our Buffalo guides - Ngo Tien Thanh in Hanoi, Hoang in Hue and Hoi An - both attentive, considerate and informative. Then 6 nights at La Veranda Beach Resort on Pho Quoc - wonderful opportunity to get our breath back! In Cambodia It was Siem Reap with Angkor Wat and our guide was Sokhoeun Bout - absolutely first class! He was invariably able to arrange our visits to avoid the main crowds (except at sunrise!) and his knowledge and his ability to communicate helped to 'bring history alive' to us. Our visit to the floating villages on Tonle Sap was absolutely 'mind blowing'. A sincere and heartfelt vote of thanks to Sokhoeun, as a guide and as a friend, and our best wishes to him and his family. We know that our views of him were shared by other English travellers we met on our travels."

He was able to answer any and all questions about the places we were visiting as well as about the rest of Cambodia, and was always happy to do so. He was also able to give us unique insight into the non-tourist visited areas ofCambodia.We found his willingness to go above and beyond quite extraordinary: always allowing us to quickly modify our daily schedule to visit a new area, grab a local roadside snack, or recommend and then offer to drop us off at local restaurants even after we were \"done for the day.\"I can very honestly say our amazing perception of this city, and the potential beauty Cambodia has to offer was greatly helped by Vuttha's personable demeanor and friendly, humble attitude. His knowledge on the monuments as also very in depth, frequently being stopped by other eaves dropping tourists to ask questions after listening in and realizing what they were missing out on! If I return to Cambodia, I will be asking for him by name.Thanks Vuttha!"

            "review": "Inconsistent, Unreliable, Disappointing. This is long but hopefully useful and fair. We booked a 24 day holiday through their London office: Bangkok, Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hue, Hoi An, Saigon / HCMC, Mekong sampan cruise, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Luang Prabang. Buffalo Tour\u2019s task was to advise us on the best itinerary to suit our priorities and organise good quality guides, vehicles and hotels efficiently and thus cut hassle to the minimum. Regrettably they failed in many respects \u2013 not disastrously but to the extent that there were numerous irritations and great inconsistency caused by sloppy organisation and poor choice of contracted suppliers.Planning and booking were straightforward but we were surprised that we had to chase for answers to some queries and indeed for our final invoice 10 days after the company\u2019s own deadline. We were also amazed that we were sent absolutely no information or tips on the countries to be visited: nothing except an e-mailed itinerary and advice on visas for a \u00a36,400 (US $9,600) holiday excluding flights.Buffalo\u2019s knowledge and our own considerable research meant that the itinerary was fine. However there was absolutely no consistency in the standards of service provided throughout the holiday. Hotel choice is quite a personal matter and we generally got it right, but the Hotel de L\u2019Opera in Hanoi and the Ancient House Resort in Hoi An (both recommended by Buffalo) were very disappointing, albeit for different reasons.Inconsistency prevailed. Some vehicles provided were fine (Saigon, Phom Penh and Siem Reap) and some \u2013 the old, basic, hard-seated minibuses for the long journeys (Hanoi- Halong Bay - Hanoi, and Hue - Hoi An \u2013 Da Nang) were very noisy and uncomfortable indeed. Similarly our guides varied enormously: Tanz in Hanoi, Thomas in Saigon and Bee in Luang Prabang were good / excellent; but San in Hue was reticent, dull and minimalistic, Sam in Phnom Penh slow and half-hearted, whereas Sowan in Siem Reap was a total disaster: late, lazy, superficial, disinterested and borderline mute (save when on one or both of his mobile \u2018phones) such that we really wasted most of our time there.The unpredictability extended to other arrangements. In Bangkok they didn\u2019t know our next-day\u2019s pick-up time for the airport and never told us until we rang from the hotel: they had forgotten. There were no promised changing facilities in Hanoi when we had several hours between the junk cruise and an overnight train journey: we were offered space to re-pack in a corridor and a shower in the swimming pool or to pay $120 to use a room. There was no car or driver to meet us at 9pm in Luang Prebang: it had not been ordered; we got a taxi. We arrived at Siem Reap at night to find that a basic room had been booked instead of the top suite we had paid for and had to wait for 40 minutes whilst the room was prepared. And so on ..There was some good service: a late change of flight when illness decreed; a room upgrade at Hue; an unsolicited personal apology and a free dinner in lieu of the forgotten vehicle at Luang Prebang. But perhaps the most telling point is that all the guides are out-sourced and although they have a Buffalo comments form for us to fill in, they are canny enough to always produce it as late as possible and then watch you fill it in as you stand at airport check-in: no time for a considered, detailed report or honest, critical comments, just a few ticks in boxes. This, coupled with no post-trip contact at all from the company (no: \u201d How did it go\u201d? or \u201cHave you any comments\u201d) confirms our view that Buffalo is simply a booking agent that cannot provide truly personal service nor bothers to really monitor the standards of its suppliers. The lack of any request for feedback therefore prompts this more public review.We are experienced and relaxed travellers and have used many travel firms to help us get our costly holidays right. Regrettably, based on this experience, we could not recommend Buffalo Tours for a trip such as ours. Revealingly the general view amongst our guides was that they were nowhere near the best that Indochina had to offer, and they should know."

Whilst it was very busy at most venues, Vuttha knew the better trails and entrances around each and so we avoided most of the tourist crush, whilst Phal the driver was very obliging, ever smiling and polite and ever offering cool waters in what was a very hot day. We really enjoyed spending time with them and what they were able to offer to make the day very memorable. thanks Vuttha and Phal, I would recommend you guys to anyone travelling locally."

I recently completed an amazing cycling tour in Vietnam & Cambodia run by Buffalo Tours.My favourite part was the Cambodian leg of the tour led by our fantastic guide, Bunvath Tes and his team, especially Pronh, our bike mechanic & truck driver. They were very organized and considerate of our needs and abilities. From the roadside snack stops through to suggesting additional places to visit (such as Phare, Cambodian Circus in Siem Reap), they took such good care of us along the way & certainly helped make our trip so much fun. Our guide Bunvath is a lovely guy. He has a kind and gentle nature & is very passionate and knowledgable about his country. Cycling through Cambodia was the perfect way to see the countryside & temples, the people & how they live all while learning about the history and culture, as well as sampling the delicious cuisine!!Overall, we had an incredible time & I would definitely recommend Buffalo Tours and our guide Bunvath Tes to anyone who is considering a trip to this remarkable country."

I just returned from an incredibly exciting trip through Cambodia, completing over 400km cycling tour for a Charity organisation called Good Return. The cycling tour was conducted by Buffalo tours, and our group was looked after by our amazing tour guide Vuttha Dam. Vuttha, along with the rest of his team including our drivers and of course our trusty bike mechanic Bol - made the entire experience enriching, entertaining, memorable and most importantly, FUN! Vuttha was very well organised and extremely flexible and responsive to the needs of the group. He kept us engaged with stories, anecdotes and interesting facts about the Cambodian way of life. Vuttha consistently went beyond the call of duty in every way possible....whenever we wanted to try some of the roadside treats such as coconut water straight from the coconut...he always took the time to stop and make sure we all got it. He even made arrangements for a late hotel checkout since my flight out of Siam Reap was not until later in the evening. Overall, Vuttha and his team were extremely pleasant to deal with, polite, flexible, knowledgeable and provided excellent customer service. He is indeed a great asset to Buffalo tours and I would highly recommend Vuttha and his team to anyone considering visiting Cambodia. Thank you Vuttha!"

We all greatly appreciated the professionalism, fun, education, guidance and care of Buffalo and Loc and highly recommend them as being able to balance time of visits, down time, logistics and food. We would, without a doubt use them again when we return and will recomend to friends and family.

We have just visited Ho Chi Minh City and when we arrived we looked for some day trip at the agency at the hotel lobby (as we usually do everywhere we go in Asia) and we booked a day trip to Mekong Delta including lunch with Buffalo Tours. After a couple of days we found out that the same trip costed 6 times less on the street agencies around the city. We were so frustrated and felt as if we were robbed. The only difference between the the agencies was that at Buffalo Tours day trip the local lunch was served on a boat at Mekong and that they picked us from the hotel. The other agencies you have to meet them in front of the agency and lunch is served on a local restaurant. Seriously, I could understand double price for the exclusivity but 6 times more is unacceptable. We learned our lesson. Buffalo tours never ever again."

We were picked up from our hotel in Siem reap in a aircondition van and supplied with cold cloths and bottled water throughout the day. Our guide, Sokhoeun Bout, was amazing! He was friendly and funny and took us to each temple (Angkor wat, Angkor thom city, Bayon temple and Ta Prohm) in great timing to adviod maximum tourists but still get good lighting. His knowledge of the history was impressive and he answered all my tideous tourist questions flawlessly. He also let our group do as little or much walking as we wanted on the hot day. Lunch was included in an airconditioned restaurant also. The day really went above and beyond my expectataions and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Cambodia. -Bonnie Wake"

            "review": "Very Good Service. My friend and I booked our whole trip to Thailand through Buffalo Tours which included a guided two day tour of Bangkok a visit to Elephant Hills and a weeks rest on the coast. We were met at Bangkok airport ( took an hour and a half to get through the airport ) and taken to our hotel in Bangkok, we had fortunately included 2 days rest and acclimatisation on arrival as it is a long journey and the heat can be debilitating initially. Our guide Kim was a pleasant well informed lady and we enjoyed a wonderful visit to the kings palace and temples of Bangkok as well as a visit to a pot making lady in a side street. We also visited the Kings summer palace and more temples ( too many temples ) and a couple of markets. Because my friend and I are in our sixties and my friend is unable to walk too much in the heat we did cut short the first days tour. On the second the guide or the company altered our tour so we did less walking. We then flew to Phuket and were met and transferred to the Elephant Hills camp site where we had a very enjoyable time ( see separate review ) for 4 days. we were then transferred to our hotel in Patong. Patong was extremely disappointing as it is very noisy and pretty second rate, not at all the relaxing week of sea and sand we had been expecting. Perhaps we relied too much on the hotel and resort recommended by Buffalo Tours and should have done our own research on the area. The hotel did not put us in the superior room with pool access that was booked by Buffalo Tours as they couldn't or wouldn't comply with our sleeping requirements ( separate beds as we are just friends ) we were given a standard room with no view, just the roof of the hotel restaurant.The accommodation was booked in June 2014 so we should have been informed that the hotel would not be able to accommodate us as requested. I cannot fault this company's organisational skills but do think they could possibly have taken our ages in to consideration when organising the Bangkok tour and the coastal resort they sent us to. However I would use them again along with doing my own research."

My husband and I are in Vietnam and wanted to get to know the city and its history, so we decided to take three tours with Buffalo Tours, which has a convenient office in our hotel, the Marriott Renaissance in HCMC. We took the nighttime street eats, the city tour, and an all-day Mekong Delta tour. All were wonderful. The street eats tour took us to back streets where local people cook delicious food for the locals--this is real Vietnam. Our guide, Brian, also taught us how to cross the streets safely, which can be a real challenge, with all of the motorbikes--you have to see it to believe it! The city tour took us to several city highlights, like the War Remnants Museum, the Reunification Palace, the Central Post Ofice, and Notre Dame Cathedral, and then we went to a factory where they make beautiful decorative lacquer items, my favorite of which were designs made from egg shells. What was really good was that our guide, Ban, let us spend as much or as little time as we wanted in each place, and afterwards, the tour ended with a long and relaxing boat ride down the Saigon River, where we could see both ends of living conditions, from total poverty to the higher end. The Mekong Delta tour was wonderful. It was mostly by boat and included, not only lunch, but a bit of a cooking class where we made spring rolls and learned how to make decorative flowers out of tomatoes, carrots, and cucumber. The chef and his staff were wonderful, very professional, and lovely. Our guide, Tin, was great! He was funny but also very informative about the Vietnam culture. During the two hour bus ride to and from the Mekong, he talked about Vietnam's history and was very entertaining. I would definitely use this company for tours."

            "review": "Very interesting experience. My husband and I took the street eats tour with Brian from Buffalo Tours, which was right in our Marriott Renaissance Hotel. He met us in the lobby and we all took a taxi to the first place, and as we walked, he showed us how to cross the extremely busy streets. We walked from place to place, on many narrow back streets filled with motorbikes. At the first stop, we had what Brian said was a typical sandwich with meats and veggies. Then we stopped at an outdoor grill and had delicious grilled chicken parts that we chose from at another place. I had the chicken feet, my husband had the wings--it was delicious, crispy, and came with a lime dipping sauce. Then we went to a place on a different street where they cooked right on the sidewalk on small portable stoves. They made what Brian called Vietnamese pizza, which was a rice paper crepe with your choice of filling. We chose egg and chives with fish flakes. Very good. All this food was very fresh. Then we went to another place for beef pho, which is a big bowl of delicious broth with lots of noodles and pieces of beef, to which you can add fresh basil, coriander, and spicy sauces and was also very good. Then walked some more and had some sweet soup with fruits as our dessert--really good and refreshing. When we were done, we all took a taxi back to the hotel. Make sure to bring your appetite. It was a lot of food. In fact, I couldn't finish it all. It was a great experience, especially when we met a local family of an 85 yr old woman, her 95 yr old sister in law, her daughter, and her 5-month old granddaughter at the soup place and we shared some photos of our family and the snow in our backyard (it never snows in Saigon--the climate is too warm). It was a lot of fun making that kind of connection, and we learned how to cross the streets without getting run over by the zillions of motorbikes! And Brian was very well organized and had an exact plan of where to go, and it took the allotted two hours as planned. He also talked a lot about Vietnamese society and culture, which was quite educational. It also gave us a feel for real local life, sitting on little plastic stools and walking through not-so-clean streets. It was a fun experience, with true Vietnamese flavor."

He accompanied us each day, provided really useful advice on all of the sites we visited, including history, architecture and the Buddhist religion as well as Cambodian culture. All of the restaurants we visited had good food, and Sokhoeun was very helpful in making sure lunches were available even if we were delayed.He didn't overdo the visits to the shopping places for tourists and concentrated on the temples and other sights. He made sure that we visited busy places at the best time of day if possible. Buffalo Tours also organised a day tour through the company Osmose which involved a trip on Ton Le Sap Lake, a visit to the floating villages and the Bird Sanctuary including the viewing post. A must for bird lovers! The guide Ko was also very informative on that day. I would really recommend Sokhoeun and Ko to other tourists. Just one thing - think twice about taking the public ferry from Siem Reap to Battambang. It is very long and the ferry broke down and took four hours longer than it should have. Better to go by road!"

Our hotel rooms were excellent (we consistently had some of the best rooms in the house) and the BT vehicles were clean and well-maintained. All in all, the professionalism of Buffalo Tours was very impressive and I certainly recommend them. The main suggestion I have for improvement is to hold off on the surveys until the end of the trip. Each of our guides in each city pressured us to complete a detailed survey in the car and give it back to them. This is different from the way most American surveys are conducted and it was uncomfortable giving any feedback for improvement. I appreciate the BT desire to be better and better - but the surveys were too \"in our face.\" All in all, an excellent tour company."

The booking desk girl was a little hard to understand and there was a little bit of confusion but she gave us a printout of everything we booked so that gave us all the information about the tour. We booked the Hidden Hanoi Walking Tour that then went into a food walking tour. A total of around 5 hours. Thuan meet us at a specified restaurant. We started out on a Cyclo tour - which is a slow ride for about an hour just taking in the sights. Then we meet Thuan again at the temple and we started walking from there. Our guide was very informative with all the history and dates of Old Hanoi. He would answer all our question even if it was not related to the tour. Our teenage boys were a little bored with all the history but still listened and took in the information. We then went straight into our food walking tour which was good timing as it was dinner time. This was the most fun and our guide would ask us if we wanted to try something and buy it for us on the street. This was a really fun experience for everyone. Again he would divert if we asked question and tailor to our desires. The boys really enjoyed this part of the tour. We ate and ate and walked and walked (our guide was a quick walker) We had the best Pho beef soup of our holiday on this tour. Thuan knew the best street places in town! He was a little disappointed that we couldn't eat anymore more we just couldn't fit it all in and we finished with a street beer and a chatted about our different lives and I think this was really good for the boys to hear from a local about living as a young, married, adult with a family and customs in Vietnam.

The first was the transfers to/from the airport in Bangkok and then the Hill Tribe Trekking in Chaing Mai.The transfers were ok and the only reason they are only getting 4*. The transfer to the Bangkok hotel was fine - but for some reason the driver was determined to try and get us to book up our sightseeing with him. I didn't really mind this terribly - but having just arrived on a long haul flight from London it was moderately annoying. Still not the reason for the mark down. The reason for the mark down was that they forgot about us for the return and were about an hour late. They hustled to get there when they realised their mistake - but it was difficult to reach them and we did spend about 40 min contemplating how to get to the airport... In the end they turned up and it was fine. But could have been less stressful.The Hill Tribe Trekking with Luke in Chaing Mai was lovely. Luke looked after us well, cooked some outstanding meals for us and showed us the beautiful countryside. We rode elephants, hitched a ride down the river on home-made rafts, had some fabulous thai massages and watched some very interesting river fishing - of which we ate the results. A great time was had by all over 3 days and we loved it. Was a good pace for our family - if possibly a bit slow - but we range in ages and didn't want to overdo it with our younger crew. Loved it. Luke also took us to the snake farm at our request & was only to happy to oblige our strange requests."

Knowledgeable, friendly, are just a few things that made him so amazing; he really knows a lot of great places to visit and made sure no one took advantage of us while we where there. Vuttha took us to several major tourist destinations such as Angkor Wat, Sihanoukville, and various temples. But what truly made Vuttha and my time in Cambodia extra special was the village trip and staying at Samrong Children's Farm.

Mr. Vinh was very professional and made us feel very safe as we carefully weaved through the local traffic! Giang was friendly, enthusiastic and very informative as a guide - his local knowledge paid off and it led to us having a great night that we otherwise wouldn't of had! My wife and I have now travelled through a good number of countries and we agreed that Giang was the best guide we have come across. We HIGHLY recommend that you ask for Giang if you visit Hanoi. You won't be disappointed. Oh, and the rest of the process with Buffalo was smooth and easy... even when we needed to change itinerary on the run."

We had a fantastic guide, Sokly Phok, take us through Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, the pole villages near Tonle Sap Lake and several other excursions that fascinated our children as well as the three adults in our group. Sokly was both highly knowledgeable and entertaining in explaining Cambodian culture. You should ask him to show you how to eat red ants as a snack! I highly recommend Sokly if you are interested in visiting the sacred ruins of Cambodia's Siem Reap region. If you are interested in photography, Sokly is especially helpful. He seemed to know all the great vantage points and best times of day to shoot each location on our itinerary."

Of particular note has been our guide in Siem Reap, Vuttha Dam. He is interesting not only about the history of the country but also about the situation today. His gentle manner is a pleasure and nothing is too much trouble for him. My family and I (both young and old) think you would be delighted if he were to be the guide to show you around the amazing splendours of Angkor. I would also recommend to others a tour of Kompong Phluk on Tonie Sap lake, about an hour from Siem Reap - a fascinating look at a very different community."

We used them to help plan and shape our trip without doing any inclusive, stuck with a group of people kind of thing. I customized a plan to go to the areas in Thailand I wanted the most and they helped me make plans that fit my budget. We were assigned one of their guides, Toto, in Bangkok and he was the kindest, more accommodating host. Our flight was 4 hours delayed getting in (like 4 am we arrived) yet they still had both a guide and driver to take us to our hotel and changed our plans for the next day so we could start in the afternoon. They had a 24 hour emergency number which we had to use once to update our info- and despite it being a national holiday they answered promptly and rectified issues quickly. We had a phenomenal time in Bangkok, Koh Sok (Elephant Hills) and Patong/Phuket- Phi Phi Islands."

For those who have travelled that road you'll know what I mean. Thahn was just delightful. He was very professional but was also great fun and very knowledgable. If you book a tour ask for Thahn ...he's worth every dong. He even took us to the airport counter to get our boarding passes. Nothing was too much trouble for him. In Ho Chi Minh our guide Eric was not as good, but he was still very nice and was also quite knowledgable. I just felt that he was in a hurry and had to be somewhere else. We had a late start which was ok, but we still finished at the original time that was scheduled. What did annoy me about his service was that his pick up time to go to the airport differed greatly from our itinerary. He picked us up at 11:45am for a 12:55 flight. We arrived at the airport 12:15 to board at 12:25. Eric did not come to the counter with us as Thahn had done, instead he dropped us at the front and took off. We had problems getting boarding passes and they gave me an emergency seat. We literally walked to the gate and boarded. However, it must be said that Eric did ring us at our resort to see if we arrived. I just don't think this was good enough...like I said I felt he was just focused on getting to other places. Overall I would use buffalo again... Great company."

We ranged from pork baguette to duck tongue with some silk worms on the way.The highlight was end of evening when you are taken to secret rooftop cafe, climb isnt advisable if you suffer from vertigo!It's not just food tour it's great opportunity to see street of Han oi and find out more about city"

The guides from Buffalo Tours, Loc in Vietnam and Sokhoeun in Cambodia made the experience all the more perfect. Both Guides Knowledge and enthusiasm for their country's history and welfare is admirable. Nothing was too much trouble for them and both went the extra distance in ensuring there was never a dull moment during our tour. The cross section of sites during the day and evening entertainment led to a very busy and fulfilling holiday. Nothing was too much trouble for Loc and Sokhoeun and any questions from the group that were not immediately answerable were looked into during there own time and answered next time we met up.

The local guides made it more interesting and answered all questions thrown at them. We had four knowledgeable and likeable guides from Buffalo Tours. We were shown some fantastic sights including of course the temples in Cambodia. Our guide there was Sokhoeun, great sense of humour and looked after us very well. He took us to some wonderful restaurants and made sure that everyone's dietary needs were catered for. The driver of the coach was excellent and drove very safely and had a little step that he put down to help people on and off. What a nice touch. In Hanoi our guide was called Hoi. He too was very funny and cheeky. While there we went to Halong Bay and cruised on a traditional wooden junk, staying overnight on the boat. Very lovely. Hoi came with the group and on the way back on the coach was very accommodating to our various demands to stop to see particular things of interest or buy souvenirs. I would thoroughly recommend this tour, the people and their culture,the sights, sounds and wonderful food is not an experience to be missed."

We had plenty of time to relax in between tour days and trips out. Fabulous. Only slight niggle was that our guide in Cambodia did not seem to have lots of knowledge about history of Angkor temples, he was great with the baby though often carrying him and helping with our bags etc."

We took a few tours with Buffalo in Vietnam and found that they took what are standard tour destination and added luxury and extra flair.We tried Buffalo tours first in SaiGon simply because they were the tour agent in our hotel lobby (Renaissance). The trip we signed up for was Cu Chi Tunnels. There were certainly some cheaper options available in town but I think the extra we paid for the Buffalo Tours version was worth the extra. Instead of a bus to get to the tunnels we were taken on a speed boat! That was a real treat early in the morning as the rush hour traffic would have been a heck of a wake up call.Our guide was both funny and knowledgable, english was better than average. The tunnels themselves were interesting, more on that in a separate review.The return trip was by bus but it was a small and personal bus that took a planned detour thru some small villages and we stopped at a cricket farm to learn about this new food being produced in the area. We met the farmer who was a war hero. We snacked on some hand rolled cricket spring rolls, yes, really and enjoyed tea. They tell us that it is a future protein source for the country but we didn't meet many people to confirm that. :)Once we returned to SaiGon we were treated to a fabulous lunch.Based on this experience we booked a trip to Ha Long Bay with Buffalo. Our Vietnam tour itinerary was quickly running out of time but Buffalo was able to secure us a return flight from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay on a seaplane! They took care of all of the logistics from car pickup, flight to Hanoi, flight to Ha Long, over night cruise (more on that in another review) and return back to Hanoi. It all went without a hick up. We would not have been able to spend that night in the bay without the logistical planning of Buffalo.To keep everything balance we took a night train from Nha Trang to Da Nang, also in a seperate review. Buffalo took care of those tickets for a very small surcharge ($6) and hand delivered the tickets to us. We are so happy we are planning a 2015 trip to Laos and Cambodia and will be sure to use Buffalo for some of the side tours. Highly recommended."

As ever, we were finding it difficult to make our minds up - especially as there are a number of variations and prices can vary.At $89 for the Buffalo Tours trip going by car and returning by boat, looked pricey - it is possible to get cheaper trips if you want to, but my advice is don't bother, go with these guys.Our guide Dominic turned up at our hotel on time with a smart newish mini-bus and after introductions off we went. It turned out that we were the only 2 on the trip, but as we had booked it the day before, they still ran it (they couldn't have made any money on it)The journey was about 1.5 hrs during which Dominic told us (in v good English) about the war, the tunnels and Vietnamese life in general which was really interesting without being over the top.On the way we stopped at a small roadside shop and saw how rice paper is made by hand (no pressure to buy, but we did anyway!) Dominic also took the opportunity to cross with us into a rubber plantation and showed us how they drew and collected latex from rubber trees.At the tunnels, it was just beginning to get busy, but because we had left so early we stayed ahead of the rush. After a fascinating tour narrated by Dominic, we climbed into the speed boat for our return Again it was immaculate, virtually new and well driven. The ride is great and it is interesting to see the countryside from the river.We stopped at a very nice riverside hotel and had an excellent lunch, then back in the boat for 10 mins to the dock and our hotel.A few commentsWe picked Buffalo after seeing the reviews, and thoroughly recommend them, you get your $89 worth, and more. It is worth paying that bit extra for the quality of the tour. It is a trip we will remember for yearsWe liked the go by bus and back by river as you get to see the countryside from two perspectives.Leave early, beat the crowds.Brilliant."

Not only this but in Siem Reap i knew of a particular shop that sold masks used in particular performances, which i thought would be a good souvenir, but as it turned out the shop was not as easy to find as i first thought it might be. Sokhoeun went out of his way to find this shop for me, and I am happy to say that I purchased one.

Fortunately Buffalo Tours had a great itinerary set up and truly delivered. Perfect for couples or a group. Might be a little boring for kids or if you\u2019re looking for something very active. This is a relaxing tour with a little adventure. OUR FAVORITE PARTS- During our tour we saw no other tour groups around. We got to see so much beautiful countryside, without having to wait in annoying lines or deal with hoards of other tourists. - Pick up at our hotel in an AC van (we only had 3 other people with us - very private!)- We got to visit a coconut farm and see how they make coconut oil, candy and other trinkets- Sightseeing along the Mekong in a small private boat, where we go to go through the coconut grooves and see how people live along the river- Riding on the back of a tuk tuk!- The last part of the trip was lunch aboard the Le Jarai which was delicious Vietnamese cuisine- We had a mini cooking class, were we learned how to properly make Vietnamese Rolls and carve veggies. As a rule, we tend to stay away from tours while traveling. We find that they are over-crowded and you\u2019re often moved around like herded cows. Thankfully our tour was the complete opposite!

So many highlights and memorable moments!On Tuesday September 9, 2014, our Cambodian guide, Sokkhoeun Bout, took us on a full day tour of Angor Thom - Angkor Wat. Sokkhoeun is to be commended on his English, knowledge, pace of tour, friendliness and care. I found some of the steps quite challenging but Sokkhoeun was considerate and gave me a helping hand when I needed it.Our driver, Mr Geurm, was friendly, courteous and drove in a safe manner.Cheers, Wendy"

On my own in HCMC with little time, so decided to utilise the tour desk in the hotel (excellent young woman on the desk sorted everything out for me very easily). Did the city and Cu Chi tunnels tours. For both trips I was the only customer, so had the advantage of a guide to myself, but would also have been nice to have other visitors alongside me. The city tour is really good to get to see the war museum and reunification palace and a bit of orientation as to the city layout, as well as an interesting boat trip on the Saigon river. I've reviewed the tunnels elsewhere, but in terms of the trip, again it was very good, with a drive there and a boat trip back, via a classy riverside restaurant. Both guides were excellent and the drivers of both boats and vans are high quality ensuring I felt safe at all times."

They picked us up and dropped us at our HCMC hotel (Liberty Central Riverside has a Buffalo tour desk in the lobby). Our guide, Kuok, was very knowledgable. He gave us an excellent run down of Vietnam's complex history on the 1.5 hour drive out to the tunnels, and was happy to answer all our questions, including about modern day life in Vietnam. It worked out at about US$30 per person or so for our group of 4, which we felt was well worth it."

All the guides were excellent, always smartly and appropriately dressed, knowledgeable considerate of our needs. The drivers were excellent and we felt safe and well looked after. All the transport was of good quality, well maintained. Two guides stood out for me - and we felt as if we had left friends behind when we returned. Phnom Penh to Battambang and Siem Reap our guide was Vuttha Dam who was fantastic. His knowledge of his country and his passion for Cambodia was clearly evident. He could not have been more helpful or considerate of our needs. In Thailand our guide was Toto, he again was so knowledgeable and considerate and was a great deal of fun to be with. I thoroughly recommend this company for your visit to Asia."

We returned from a trip to Cambodia and Thailand last week. we booked through the Great Holiday Collection who use Buffalo Tours (as we did last year for Vietnam). I cannot praise Buffalo Tours enough for the excellent guides and drivers they use. In Phnom Penh our guide Mekara was really knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and was patience answering our endless questions. Departing there going on to Battambang and Siem Reap our guide was Vuttha Dam, who I see has been mentioned already. Again, Vuttha was an excellent guide, his knowledge, his enthusiasm for his country shone through and we had an excellent time. He could not have been more thoughtful or attentive, takes a great photo and had endless bottles of cold water for us! On to Bangkok where we met Toto - a very knowledgeable, interesting and considerate guide whose company we enjoyed greatly. All the drivers were also very good, and we felt safe and comfortable with them - my apologies that I cannot recall all their names. All the staff were always immaculately dressed and highly professional. Reading the brochure we found in the mini bus, we read some of the history of the company. Amazing! Well done Buffalo Tours - would definitely use again if we head to Asia! We are family of four - two twenty something daughters so I'm going to tick the 'friends' profile!"

My expectations were well and truly exceeded at every step, good accommodation, wonderful food, a thorough and genuine look at Cambodian life all through lovely, attentive and knowledgable guides. From first being picked up from the airport, I knew I was in very capable hands, with both my city guides who were helpful, personable, knowledgeable and great fun. Spending the most time in Siem Reap, I got to know my guide Sokhoeun better and found him to be professional, extremely helpful and exceptionally well informed - not to mention all the laughs we had together along the way!

And as good as they were in Hanoi the last 3 days in Saigon have been even better.In Hanoi we stayed in the Silk Path Hotel and our guide Phuong was attentive, knowledgeable and gracious in his flexibility when both my husband and I were unwell on separate days. We were able to make changes to our tour itinerary on the spot and nothing was a bother. We also did a 2d, 1n cruise of HaLong Bay with Paradise Cruises organised by Buffalo Tours which was faultless.On arrival into Ho Chi Minh City the vivacious and personable Tin was waiting for us. We were immediately impressed by Tin and our driver Mot for being so flexible as to do our tour, which had been scheduled for the afternoon, in the morning as our hotel room was not yet available. Tins' candour and knowledge was truly impressive, and is such a personality that if he isn't available to be our guide next time we are in town, I truly hope we can get together for coffee or a meal. We also appreciated both Tin and Mot, our driver extrordinaire (and that is saying something driving in VietNam) making themselves available to take us to the Cu Chi Tunnels on a Saturday morning which we only requested the day before.Seriously if you are looking for a tour company look no further and please request Phuong in Hanoi and Tin in Ho Chi Minh."

We all learned so much, from ancient through modern history, to stopping to talk to an old lady and her buffalo in a field to really understand what her buffalo means to her and her family. I don't know whether you ever award prizes or commendations to your guides, but if so we would like to nominate him please.Our driver, Van Anh, was also very good and helpful.We have never travelled with Buffalo Tours before, but based on this experience we will in the future certainly book with you again if we are fortunate enough to return to this part of the world."

This visit was supposed to be in Spanish and it was supposed to last 3.5h. They charged us 51$. We were supposed to be picked up at the hotel at 8am. We were asked, by email, if we could be picked up at 7.30am, which we agreed to. So, we started our visit at 7.30 with a tourguide that spoke Spanish. He left at 9:00 am, saying that he had another businesses to attend. He left us in the middle of the War Remnants museum and told us to explore it by ourselves. The van, however, remained in the museum and was to take us wherever we wanted after our visit to the museum. Of course, we went back to Buffalo Tours and complained. We had paid for a 3.5h long guided tour and received a 1.5h long guided tour. We claimed a refund for the service we never got (half the visit). In the beginning, they only wanted to refund me with 20$ (they said that we had paid 40$ instead of 51$, that the extra 11$ was to pay their management activities). I complained again. I had to negotiate really hard to get back the corresponding 20$ for each person that had participated in the visit. However, the story does not end here. The tourguide contacted us, on the phone, and complained about our complaint, demanding why we had dared to told the agency that he left early, that he had already warned us (a filthy lie). If he had warned us, we would have gone to the agency right away to request another guide. As I did not want to waste my time arguing I hang up the phone, but I found that tourguide rather unprofessional and unreliable. If I ever happen to go to Southern Asia, I will truly avoid Buffalo Tours. Bad, unprofessional service, with even worst guides."

My wife noticed this young lady at her desk with a Buffalo Tours sign on her desk. We approached her and thought our tour was booked with them. This young ladies name was Chau and after some phone calls and discussing with our cruise company and Flight Centre she discovered that we weren't booked with Buffalo Tours for the cruise. Flight centre had booked it direct with the cruise company. Now I wouldn't have blamed this young lady at all if she said \"too bad its not my problem\". But to our delight she perserved and made these phone calls (at her expense) to find out what time we were being picked up. She must have pursued this issue for 20-25 minutes and finally got the answer we needed. I can't recommend this young lady enough. She really made us feel so relieved and it was so nice to meet her. Chau was in Hanoi that week but I think she was moving back to Ho Chi Minh City the next day.

Vuttha was our guide in cambodia and was so knowledgable and really brought to life the interesting past of his country. He was also great company and made some of the long journeys fly by. Vuttha if you are reading this good luck with your wedding!! From Ally and Lawrence"

The organisation was excellent, I was escorted and met throughout by knowledgable guides with excellent english. Whether rtravelling by rail plane or private car everything went smoothly and to plan. I was the only person in the party but was made to feel welcome safe and special. The hotels were supurb (I chose the Luxury option) and the itinerary wonderful. All five of my guides were just so friendly and helpful and knew all the best places to go to. I would recommend this firm to anyone. I have not compared the prices but as I booked a package via Tropical sky including Business class travel I fewlt I certtainly had value for money."

We went to Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hue, Hoi An, HCMC, Phu Quoc, and Siem Reap. It truly exceeded our expectations. In the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and at Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, we were taken to areas that were off the beaten path, and not full of other tourists. We felt we had a real inside look at some of the culture here. In Halong Bay, our ship \"Aphrodite\" was spectacular. La Veranda Resort in Phu Quoc was the perfect escape from the busy city. All of the suggestions Linh made were spot on. Our guides were what really made our trip special! Donny (Hanoi) picked us up at the airport and gave us very useful advice. Son, (Hue/Hoi An guide) was friendly and informative, and constantly made us feel at ease. He truly knew a lot about all of the areas he took us to and answered our many questions. He was very kind. Thomas (HCMC guide) was very fun and knowledgeable, and had us constantly laughing. At the CuChi Tunnels, he provided us with a truly special experience. We left with a much better understanding of the war and culture. From the moment we met him, we felt like old friends. Both Son and Thomas paid special attention to what our needs and interests were, and we learned a great deal while enjoying the sights. Our drivers were also safe and friendly, which was important in these hectic cities.In Cambodia, our guide Vuttha Dam was caring, attentive, and provided us with much cultural background. We could have talked with him for hours. His passion for his job is obvious and inspiring. He constantly made sure we had enough water and often offered to carry our bags as well! He truly was extraordinary and we felt lucky that we had him as our guide. Our driver, Sakhorn, was extremely safe, and always had a smile for us as he opened our doors or handed us a cooled refreshing towel after returning to the the car! He kept the car very clean and his attention to detail was impressive.Overall, we felt very confident using Buffalo Tours. Any concerns we had were immediately addressed. This company takes pride in its service. We would highly recommend using them, especially the guides mentioned above!"

            "review": "Vietnam & Cambodia. From start to finish, every moment of this trip was the experience of a lifetime. A friend and I heard about Buffalo through a guide book and the Internet, and coordinated via email to plan this trip with Linh. She was very patient and helpful in making sure we had planned the perfect itinerary, and it truly was special. We went from Hanoi to Halong Bay to Hue to Hoi An to Ho Chi Minh to Mekong Delta to Phu Quoc and finally Cambodia over the course of two weeks. Along every stop, the guides (who all spoke excellent English), transfers, drivers, hotels, and experiences were top notch. Buffalo succeeds in providing one of a kind experiences, and exceeds all expectations. In Hanoi, Donny provided excellent advice that helped us navigate the city, and in Halong Bay, the overnight boat recommended by Buffalo, The Aphrodite, was just spectacularly beautiful and served amazing food. In Hue, our guide, Son, was engaging and informative. We had a great time learning about the history of Hue and Hoi An, the drive over the Hai Van pass was great fun, and also very safe with our driver. In Ho Chi Minh, we toured the Cu Chi Tunnels with Thomas, our guide. From the moment he collected us at the airport, he felt like an old friend, and his knowledge about the history and perspectives of the Vietnam War really taught us a lot. Thomas also brought us to the Mekong Delta, were it absolutely poured, but with Thomas we laughed and learned and had the time of our lives visiting a coconut facility and brick making kiln. We also learned how to make straw mats, rode a fabulously fun \"taxi\", and had a terrific lunch and cooking class on a boat. In Phu Quoc, we stayed at La Veranda to recharge for a day, and it was absolutley beautiful. Then it was off to Siem Reap, Cambodia, where we had the good fortune to have Vuttha Dam as our private guide. Wow, is he spectaular! His knowledge and passion for the history and culture of Cambodia just left us speechless. He along with our amazing driver, SaKhorn, were so attentive to our every need. They constantly opened doors for us and offered us water and cold wipes (it was very hot!). At the temples, Vuttha gave us so much interesting information, and answered our every question (and we had a lot!). He was always making sure we safely navigated the temple steps, and even offered to carry all of our things! Our visit to a Cambodian village was made even more interesting because Vuttha had grown up in that area, so his stories and knowledge of the area made the experience all the more special. Vuttha and SaKhorn are truly assets in the Buffalo company! All of our drivers were outstanding and made us feel very safe and were especially friendly, but I would like to particularly thank SaKhorn for his careful driving in Cambodia. As can be expected when travelling, we had one hiccup when we arrived at the hotel in Siem Reap, because they did not have available the room with twin beds Buffalo booked for us. When we called the office, Vuttha came running back within 5 minutes, spoke on the phone with Buffalo, and he and SaKhorn whisked us off to an upgraded hotel. Within 30 minutes the problem was completely solved way beyond our satisfaction. Vuttha would not even leave the hotel until he confirmed that our new room did indeed have two beds! It was truly amazing how quickly Buffalo resolved this problem, which really was the hotel's fault. Also, all of the breakfasts at the hotels were delicious and plentiful. I would absolutely recommend booking a tour through Buffalo. You will not be disappointed, and can feel confident that they will help you plan amazing, original experiences and will pay attention to every detail! In fact, I plan on using them again for a future trip to Thailand!"

One guide Tin met us at Siagon, transferred us to our Sampan and then 3 days later met us at Chau Doc to make sure we departed smoothly on the fast ferry to Phnom Penh. Great service by Buffalo Tours. Phnom Penh guide, transfers and hotels were excellent and then the service moved up to another level when we arrived in Siem Reap. Our guide Vuttha Dan in Siem Reap was excellent. He was most friendly and considerate, and has a very good knowledge of Cambodia, its people, ways of life, and culture. He was always reliably on time, and his English is good. Our day trip to the countryside to see the local people was particularly interesting. Vuttha went well beyond the call of duty helping my wife up and down the steep steps at the temples, always seeing we had cold water and helping with any change we wanted throughout the tour. He is a excellent ambassador for Buffalo Tours and Cambodia.The driver So was very capable, and always drove safely even when in difficult traffic and road conditions. We would highly recommend Buffalo Tours and your guides to other visitors to your country."

They said it was not too late and now say this is a significant reason for our problems. They also said I did not mention my health issues , these were again stated clearly in the first telephone call with my wife from them in response to my email to their Vietnamese website. They say I said I would be happy to use them again in reality I said I may use them as long as I could avoid involvement of UK office. etc..etc IF THEY CAN DENY SUCH CLEAR SIMPLE FACTS I MUST SUGGEST YOU AVOID UK OFFICE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!

In Phnom Penh Ms. 'Smey was an excellent host, especially given the difficult job of taking me to Tuol Sleng prison and explaining in great detail the atrocities that took place there. In Siem Reap and beyond Mr. Sokvichet (Chet) Chin also was a font of information regarding temples, history, Buddhism, Hinduism, good restaurants, and plenty of other information. He made every effort to make sure my stay was excellent.Perhaps the best surprise was that, although I loved visiting many temples, I especially was affected by visiting the Chansar Village and Kampong Khleang, both of which provided me with an experience of real life in Cambodia, which for me was equal parts beautiful and poignantly sad in parts. But I wanted the real thing, insofar as an American can get it."

We used Buffalo on a guide/driver basis whilst travelling in Vietnam in December 2013.The original review I posted got 'bumped' for some reason so I re-submit it as hopefully it will give some useful tips when deciding whether to use them.We booked Buffalo from the UK and enjoyed having our own driver and English speaking guide in Hanoi, Hue and HCMC as well pick up drop offs from Airport. WE had city tours, lunches and dinners included as well as visiting Cu Chi tunnels.The guides we had were Tan, Vi and Tin who all had great senses of humour and were knowledgeable about their country, the history and customs whilst being attentive to our needs at all times. We also visited the Mekong delta for the day and below is the overnight trip to Hailong Bay we did with them. When we had a problem with a hotel in HCMC Buffalo resolved it quickly and moved us to a great place. See my other reviews of Vietnam.Our trip to Hailong Bay from Hanoi was a 4 hour journey on a road which is being upgraded for much of the route. All I can say is that it will be a much more comfortable journey when the road is upgraded to dual carriageway.It was an interesting journey with comfort stops in both directions at Silk works which employ disabled and disadvantaged youngsters. We bought some items which turned out to be good quality and value (and not seconds or inferior material).On arrival at the ferry/boat terminal we were met by Buffalo staff and transferred to the L\u2019Azalee by its own tender, a five minute trip.The L\u2019Azalee is a splendid wooden clad Junk with immaculate fixtures and fittings.We were lucky enough to have our spacious berth at the rear of the boat with our own balcony and reclining chairs. Simply lovely.The room/cabin was clean, functional and comfortable. It had everything we needed, certainly for a 24 hour stay. We slept really well at our moorings in the middle of the Bay.Our one night trip consisted of 12 crew tending 5 guests! Boy, were we well looked after!We had a 6 course (at least) lunch on arrival together with a briefing as to what we might be doing. The weather in December was beautiful and we were able to sunbathe after lunch as we sailed (under power) to an area where we were to spend the night (along with many other junks). Great scenery and photo opportunities.We moored late after noon and went kayaking for an hour on a millpond bay whilst then swimming around the boat in lovely warm if not clear water before visiting a cultured pearl factory and seeing the process first hand. After sunset photos en route we had a wonderful sea food banquet over about 90 minutes with courses constantly arriving. Being only five guests we dined together and shared many stories of our travel experiences. We were pleased this happened as we enjoyed the interaction with other guests that we might not otherwise done had the boat been full with up to 50 guests. It was a marvellous spread with cheery and smiling crew always on hand.After dinner we enjoyed a 'hands on' demonstration on \u2018a hundred different ways to make a carrot, tomato etc. look like a swan, chicken, dragon etc. Can still remember a few but a little tip here; take lots of close up photos if you want to do this at home.After dinner, squid fishing by light off the tender. One hour\u2026no joy.The following morning we joined the crew on the top deck for 0630 tai chi before breakfast. A great wait to see the sun come up and before a delicious breakfast. Straight after breakfast we were off the caves with our Buffalo guide and spent the next 90 minutes wandering through the caves.After this, a leisurely cruise back to the terminal arriving at about 12 noon. A whirlwind 24 hours but so much fun and despite all we packed in, a relaxing time. Wished we had had an extra night on board. We are planning to use Buffalo when we travel to Myanmar shortly such was the good impression they left!"

He answered any questions or concerns in a speedy and professional manner.Upon arriving in Siem Reap after over 24hrs of travel, our lovely guide Sokkhoeun Bout and driver Jin were waiting for us with a smile. He explained a short history of Cambodia with true passion on our ride to our home for the week, Steung Siem Reap Hotel (in the heart of the city just walking distance to the night market and pub street). You could tell he loves his country and is very knowledgeable. The hotel is 4 star and more than we expected.During the week Sokkhoeun gave us a thorough explanation of all the temples we visited with great enthusiasm and of course took us to the highlight of our trip, sunrise at Ankgor Wat. He was even kind enough to take us to the local war museum in Siem Reap on our way back from Ankgor Wat and briefly explained the history of why the war was started and how his family was affected. It was heartbreaking to hear about his family and how he survived. On our last day, our itinerary included a day visiting a local village, visiting with the local children and lunch cooked for us by a local family. Our guide in the village, was a young English teacher (whose name slips my mind at the moment). We took a tour of the rice fields and even got a ride on a local \"Hummer\" (Ox). At the end of the village tour we were lucky enough to receive a blessing by a local monk.I would highly recommended booking a trip with Buffalo Tours if you plan on visiting Siem Reap. The tour prices are reasonable and include hotel, breakfast, tour passes, professional tour guide (Sokkhoeun is amazing!) and air conditioned rides with cold water/towels waiting for us after each tour stop (thank you Jin!)."

Overall we had a good trip taking in Luang Prabang, Vientiane, a few days cruising the Mekong, Angkor Wat/Siem Reap, Phnom Penh and a few days on the Cambodian coast at Kep.Buffalo people in the UK were friendly and helpful in setting it up and we don't have major complaints. But we did hit some significant and avoidable snags:  - Su's passport is in her maiden name. Buffalo knew that, but booked the internal flights in her married name (we booked our own long haul). We only realised that after we arrived and Su had to make 2 domestic flights on tickets that did not match her passport - really she should not have been allowed on the plane. Quite a serious mistake.- A flight had been booked for very early in the morning to take us from Vientiane to Pakse in order to board the Mekong boat the following day. Pakse and it's \"best\" hotel are both miserable, and definitely not worth any tourist time. So why get us up at 4.30am and maximise the time there? We realised and got it changed to a later flight. - We only realised when we met other people that there were two far better hotels in Champasak that were just as suitable for the Mekong cruise so we could have avoided Pakse altogether, but Buffalo didn't point that out to us.- The longish road journey from Kep to Phnom Penh at the end was in a car with no seatbelts for passengers: important, basic stuff that any international tour company should get right as a priority. Buffalo had changed the hotel we'd chosen in Phnom Penh without telling us, and the one they changed it to wasn't that well-rated. We only realised what had happened as we were leaving home and asked them to change to a better hotel - the White Mansion (which is terrific). They responded well and gave us an upgrade to compensate. One of the attractions of Buffalo was that they directly employ guides everywhere. That was helpful as we could get them to make the changes we needed. On the other hand, the quality of the guides was - as far as we could see - no better (or worse) than those used by others, and varied quite a bit. On the other hand, the time we spent with the guides was very valuable in getting an insight into the countries. In particular, the guide in Phnom Penh, who was born just after the Khymer Rouge took power and whose family had a terrible time, was a privilege to talk to.Overall therefore, they did a reasonable job, their prices seemed ok, but we were not too impressed by their attention to detail."

All in all the level of service and communication re transfers etc was excellent with no hiccups at all. All staff were very professional, courteous and spoke good English The information given during tours was relevant, interesting and certainly helped our understanding of this fascinating country, its society, history and cultures. Using Buffalo Tours certainly instilled confidence during our visit with no unforeseen hassles. Rather BT's expertise added value and gave a good insight that would have been missed without their narrative. Particular highlights were overnight trip to Sapa inc visiting the villages and homes of some indigenous tribes; the Citadel & Perfume River cruise in Hue. Trip to Halong Bay was fabulous for obvious reasons, but came away feeling that we visited too late and that our 24 hour stay was just part of a commercial process. Halong Bay is on most bucket lists, but if you can try and select one that is off the beaten track... though I appeciate tourists like us ard the cause of the problem! My main point is the you can have confidence in Buffalo Tour's ability to put together itineraries thar will meet if not exceed expectations and enhance your Vietnam experience....Thanks Mr Vung, Ms Lan & others"

We toured various historic temples, took a great bike ride through the villages and a memorable canoe ride through the rice paddies and took dozens of pictures of the beautiful rock formations in the preserve. Khoa also took us to lunch where we had delicious Vietnamese food; we ate so much that I was too full for dinner later! Finally, the tour began and ended in a comfortable and air conditioned tour van. We also stopped multiple times for bathroom breaks which was very convenient. Khoa was fantastic and gave us some interesting history of Hanoi as well. I would recommend this tour for anyone interested in Hanoi or nearby areas."

Big mistake. A lot of things went wrong and a manager called Mattie Scholts finally came to talk to us on the final day of our holiday promising to address the issues and get back to us. He never did, despite several emails.This is what happened to us:1. When we arrived at Bangkok airport on 19 November there was nobody to meet us. My husband had to phone the office to sort things out and we had to wait an hour before our guide eventually turned up. 2. On 21st November there was confusion. The guide was not sure whether the summer palace at Ayuttaya was open or not so we drove all the way there only to find out that it was closed. The guide should have known this beforehand. As a result we had a three and a half hour road trip back to Bangkok because our cruise back had been cancelled. We were only told this when we were at Ayuttaya. Had we been told this before, we would probably have chosen not to make the trip. Although we were offered an evening trip instead, there was no point is doing this since the aim of the trip was to a) take photographs and it would have been dark; b) see an area we had not already covered. 3. On 28th November there was nobody to meet us when we arrived at Phuket airport. Again my husband had to contact the office to find out what was happening. Eventually an airport official put us in contact with a Phuket Venture representative who had no knowledge of our existence but who was supposed to be meeting other Buffalo Tours passengers. Our names were not on her list. Eventually we were put in a taxi. We had no guide and no opportunity to find out about Phuket on our trip towards our hotel. Also, the driver did not know where our hotel was and it took much longer to get there than in should have, had our arrival been properly managed. Eventually we were contacted via the driver by Nawin from Venture Phuket who claimed that Buffalo Tours had only just contacted him with our details and that before then he had no knowledge of our existence and therefore that no trips were booked. He said he had managed to book the trips we had requested (and Buffalo Tours had confirmed) but that the days would have to be reversed since there was no space at this late date. He told us to be ready on 29th November for a 05.45 pick up. We had to phone on several occasions the following morning because, again, there was nobody there at the agreed time. The bus eventually turned up at 06.55 and again the driver had got lost because he did not know where the hotel was. On the night of 29th, we received a fax from Phuket Venture confirming pick up for 07.30 on 30th. Again, transport was late and did not arrive until 07.55. The driver had got lost looking for the hotel. To make things worse, neither of the two days snorkelling trips were really snorkelling trips. The trip to the Similan islands had two 40 minute opportunities and the trip to the Phi Phi islands contained two 30 minute sessions, and the second session was only made available because we complained. 4. The Rawai hotel was not finished. We were not told this. There is no gym, no spa and not even a bar in the pool. The jacuzzis do not work and there was noise from drills all day."

You see a lot of the main tourist points in Hanoi. The day ended with a cyclo ride I was glad this was included as it is something I really wanted to do, but have heard so many horror stories about scams. Having it set up by a reputable company made it much more enjoyable. It was a great way to see some of the old quarter, and then the cyclo dropped me off at the hotel when we were done. My tour guide even called me at the hotel afterwards to make sure it was enjoyable and that there were no problems."

The guide spoke good English and did a great job of making sure we were all in the right place at the right time. Our boat (azalee), we were told, was new and it certainly felt looked much newer than most of the other boats in the bay. Rooms were excellent with big bathrooms - we were particularly lucky to get a room with its wn balcony. Special mention to the chef on the boat who produced great meals each time. Kayaking experience was well organised and fun for those like us who aren't natural sailors. Trip to cave also good though you share the stalactites etc with thousands of others. All in all a highligh of the trip - we'll certainly try to use Buffalo again."

The boat for the cruise of Ha Long Bay seemed very nice - private bathrooms and a great staff. However, a few of our friends saw a lot of cockroaches in their room. Also, after the cruise, about 5 of us ended up getting pretty terrible food poisoning, which we're almost entirely sure we got on the boat. I wouldn't eat the raw fruits, vegetables, or seafood in the future. Stick to things that are cooked and you'll be fine.Also, I would say this tour was slightly overpriced, given where we stayed. The price per person was about $400 for a 4 day, 3 night tour. Given how cheap Vietnam is, I think one could find a better deal."

The logic behind the guide's explanations was difficult to follow and confusing.

My husband and I were picked up from the HCMC airport by our personal guide and driver and driven to our hotel, \"Duxton Hotel Saigon\". We do like to wander around cities on our own, so we did not book any local tours (per se) with Buffalo in HCMC. The same guide and driver arrived on time (late morning) the next day to drive us to our embarkation point (approx. 70 kms to My Tho) for our wonderful Mekong River cruise aboard the Heritage Line's, \"MV Jayavarman\". Information along the way to My Tho, about life in general in Vietnam and Cambodia were answered and new infrastructures pointed out.After a wonderful cruise on the river and transfer by ferry to Siem Reap Port, the passengers were all taken in a coach to our different hotels in Siem Reap, in our case, the beautiful \"Victoria Angkor Resort & Spa\". Our guides both in HCMC and Siem Reap were very courteous and their English was quite good. Bottles of chilled water were always available. Our three days in Siem Reap went like clockwork. Our guide was very patient with us taking zillions of photos, and walking us to great advantage points for taking photos, and very informative about the construction of the famous temple complexes and the ongoing restoration of the temples. The pickup to go the airport was on time and once again flawless. For fellow Australian travellers, Buffalo Tours do have an office in Sydney, agent.oz.@buffalotours.com and the staff were more than helpful in quickly answering our emails with questions about different parts of the cruise, hotels and land tours. I think in the short time we were in Siem Reap we saw as many landmarks and visiting villages and a school as we could, without being urged to get back in the vehicle type of mentality that you sometimes get with group tours. The Buffalo Tour packaging of HCMC, Heritage Cruise and our stay in Siem Reap went perfectly. In the time that we had, we did and saw everything that we wanted to see and do. I would certainly recommend people to book a tour with them."

She was always prompt, incorporated things we wanted to do and worked really hard to make this trip come together. Thanks to her! Then, in country, we had the pleasure of very, very good guides that really made the trip. Especially Dam Vuttha in Cambodia was extremely knowledgeable and fun! And Bee, in Luang Prabang, Loas was very sweet and knowledgeable. Thank you Bee! The tours they set us up were fantastic enjoyed by all of us. Airport transfers and pickups were always prompt.

We were picked up on time and then drove downtown Siem Reap further and further into small streets, barely lit up. We stopped and we were wondering if the driver and the guide were lost as there was nothing except a small square surrounded by low buildings, the vague outline of a temple, a few trees... All was dark and we were asked to wait inside the car...We were a bit worried if truth be told. After a few minutes, the guide asked us to step outside of the car, we turned around and gasped: there was an alley of candles in paper bags on the floor leading us to some low reclining cushions in front of a very large white fabric screen. The puppet troupe explained a little bit about what we would see and hear, then they gave thanks in front of an altar and a big flame jumped behind the screen, colouring the evening orange. Young men carrying giant puppets made of cut out cow hide started to dance and sway and jump and kick: the stories are from the Ramayana and well known by the locals; for us it was not so easy but the puppets are magnificent. The fire built up higher and stronger; the swirl of different puppets was dizzying; there were chants accompanying everything, even some acrobatics. In the end, we were able to speak to the enthusiastic young men -who speak good English and travel a lot with their puppets- and also we were able to hold the puppets and see them from close as the fire died down. We came back to the hotel completely elated. A great memory to last forever."

He duly delivered as all day we seemed to just miss the tour groups and gained brilliant photographs! He gave us all the facts and information and was an excellent guide.The next day we went to the floating villages, again the itinerary changed. He took us to a village market first and then to a different floating market that was further away and less touristy. It was all very interesting though sad to see the conditions they were living in. Again we had a fascinating insight into their life. Two very interesting and informative days thanks to Sukkhoeun who not only gave us the facts and figures but helped us understand the culture of Cambodia, both past and present. "

Prior to us going to Cambodia many people around me had concerns including myself. However, when we arrived to Cambodia via the Mekong River because we were in Chau Doc, Viet Nam we were taken cared of extremely well. Vuttha Dam, Suy Vet and his team very always accommodating to our groups request and needs. We had the privilege to tour Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Angkor Wat and a village Chansar. It was by far a great experience with educated tour guides Vuttah and Suy Vet who made the experience very meaningful to our educational growth and personal desires fulfilled. Our itinerary was very intense because it was for educational purposes, but it was balanced well with allowing us to do community service along with touring the historical sites and taking advantage of the beauty of village life in Cambodia during our home stay. I highly recommend Vuttah Dam, Suy Vet and their team on all of your personal, business or educational tours because their priority is your safety along with allowing you to experience Cambodia in a pleasant way. Our bus driver was excellent as well he impressed me on how he was able to get our bus in what looked like narrow areas but he managed to get us everywhere in a safely manner and on time. Overall, I am well please with the Buffalo Tours tour guides Vuttha Dam and Suy Vet, the bus driver and the rest of the team they are great assets and very valuable to the company.Thank you for making my experience in Cambodia a memorable one where I want to come back to visit. I highly recommend Buffalo Tours because of the people I mentioned."

However, the agent was my first contact, and it wasn't a good experience. We ended up paying almost double for a one-day tour of Tam Coc because the agent apparently heard me ask for Saturday but entered the date for Friday, and so when we returned from a 2-day tour of HaLong Bay (through a different agency) on Friday evening, we were told by the agent that we had missed our tour and forfeited our money. Since I had told her at the time of booking that I would be in HaLong Bay on Friday and wanted to book Tam Coc for Saturday, I was shocked at the mistake. Unfortunately, I didn't look at the printed confirmation carefully because we didn't receive it until late at night due to a problem with the agent's printer at the time of booking. In any case, we rebooked, paid again but were given a small discount, and went to Tam Coc through Buffalo Tours. If I were doing this again, I would not trust the Buffalo agent to do her job, and I would definitely not give in and pay a second time for the single tour, because we ended up grumbling about it most of the day during the tour and didn't enjoy the sites."

We booked the tour from Australia and we were very impressed with the excellent communication. They replied to emails promptly and we're very helpful. We were collected from our hotel at 8am and driven out of the busy city to begin our cycling tour. It was an awesome experience cycling through local villages and rubber plantations. Our guide cycled in front of us and a van followed us so we were well looked after. The only gripe was we felt continuously rushed throughout the tour. This may have been because it was so busy at the tunnels but we dashed around them and felt that we missed out on info and the whole experience, We also would have like to have taken a few photos on the bike tour as we had our cameras on us but did not get the opportunity to stop or any information on the area, the lunch was great and we were taken back to our hotel before 3pm. For over $450 aus dollars did not feel it was worth it."

We are a family of 5 and used Buffalo tours after comparing them to the likes of Intrepid and the Imaginative traveller etc. We thought they were fantastic. A tailor made tour to Laos and Vietnam using their and our own ideas via email with their web team with no request unable to be accommodated. Cheap airfares and connections to Singapore which was our entry.exit point. And a cost about 60pc what we think an equivalent offshore company would have charged. There were 3 highlights. We chose 3 star accommodation to save money. Well it was great for 3 star, much better than we anticipated. Secondly the included lunches were almost all absolute banquets of local cuisine which was again a bonus. lastly the actual guides themselves. We were met off every plane and at the end of each section delivered to the departure gates by these lovely smiling people. We especially enjoyed Tinh in Hanoi, Hai in Hue and Ruby in HCMC. Well done Buffalo Tours, we are well travelled, sometimes independently and sometimes on tours and will always look to use a local company like you in the future.

We booked Buffalo Tours' Sapa to the Sea tour. The price was more than I expected, but we enjoyed the entire experience. We saw other guides in Sapa and felt quite happy that we went with Buffalo as the other guides' English and tours left much to be desired. The best part for us was that all the details (train tickets, transfers, mini bus to Halong Bay) we're all taken care of, and all we had to do was show up. Two things to know if you do the Sapa to the Sea tour: 1. Sapa is treking non-stop. If you have any mobility problems or a fear of heights, this is not the trip for you. Also, on the boat on Halong Bay, the menu is ENTIRELY seafood. Overall, we enjoyed our experience and would book with Buffalo Tours if we came back to SE Asia."

He was incredibly knowledgeable about his country, extremely friendly and kind to the whole group (38 in total), and he went out of his way to ensure that everyone had the best time possible. We were in the centre of Vietnam when Typhoon Haiyan hit, and he worked tirelessly to ensure that everyone was well informed and safe. Then when the typhoon had passed, he altered the itinerary to ensure that we made up for the things that had to be cancelled.  Above all, we appreciated the fact that Loc was so proud of his country and his people, and was grateful to us for taking the trouble to visit Vietnam. The pleasure was ours, Loc, I promise you! We were sorry to say goodbye to him, and our wonderful memories of his amazing country have been, in a large part, made by his stewardship."

The cabins were spacious and the food was good (although more style than substance and not worthy of the glowing reports that others have left on tripadvisor). The main problem was that the boat was infested with cockroaches. We saw three: one walking by our table during dinner, one in our shower and one got inside my luggage(!!). Although this is of no fault of the operator, Ha Long Bay itself is quite dirty and needs to be cleaned up."

He was also skilled in the use of my bulky DSLR and took magnificent shots of me swinging/jumping into the pools.

I used Buffalo Tours' experienced staff to book a 5 week trip covering travel from Hong Kong to Vietnam and Cambodia and back, then after Taiwan we also toured Thailand - a fairly new Buffalo tours area.I was confident from the start that we had a tour operator that knew the local tours market and destinations well. Their choice of hotels was very good and excellent value for money, selected according to our preferences. The guides were all really helpful and knowledgeable - with good quality vehicles and safe drivers. Faced with the inevitable culture shock of travelling to Asia - it was a real comfort to realise that you were in safe hands.I look back on the trip from HCMC through the Mekong delta to Cambodia and Siam Reap/Angkor as a first rate experience with a great exposure to all the region has to offer. I found the advice accurate and the itinerary fully met our desire to see as much as we could in a relatively short time we had there. The guides were courteous and spoke good English, as well as having a sense of humour.The Thailand leg was and excellent introduction involving a really well led guided bird watch of the Doi Ithanon reserve in the mountains of the North, trekking into the forest and a home stay, elephant rides and bamboo rafting, then travelling South for a relaxing stop at Koh Samui in a lovely hotel in the Gulf of Thailand. The staff at London did a great job coping with my requests for unusual trips such as the bird watching on Tongle Sap lake in Cambodia and the extra effort made the trip really individual and valuable - this \"client led \" planning was really good value for money.During the tours we had timely advice of issues that affected us and the London staff were really on the ball about any changes, offering alternatives in Phonm Penh when the state funeral closed part of the city down.I feel we were lucky to find such a good operator on our first trip and would highly recommend them."

Since our return I have sung the the praises of the staff,for providing \"that extra\" dimension to service,their planning and customer provision was outstanding.This was evidenced by our first contact here in Australia for a personalized incountry tour,including internal flights x 3,2 nights on the Mekong ,as well as a private venture into the Baria and Vung Tau region, with all attendant transfers.We were impressed the moment we were greeted in Hanoi by the conduct ,courtesy and professionalism of our guides and drivers which became the standard of all our encounters throughout our trip.I have no hesitation in recommending Buffalo Tours to anyone who wants a service of the highest caliber of customer care and service."

What a wonderful experience, top notch service. They did everything to ensure a smooth trip: confirming our flights (we did not book with them), private car, knowledgeable tour guides, esp Thanh in Ha Noi. Quynh, our main contact, is great. She helped with all our last minute changes and even get us the tickets for water puppet show on the same day. Knowing that my husband and I were on our honeymoon, Quynh arranges a complimentary dinner for us and free-upgrade in all hotels. Thank you for a wonderful trip, will use them again in the future. They are truly the only choice in South Asia."

I worked online with one of their agents- Pham Ly. She helped me design itineraries for Northern Thailand, Bangkok area, Angkor Wat and the surrounding area as well as Hanoi and a two night boat tour on Halong Bay. She was more then patient in responding to my requests for the types of hotels I wanted and the types of things we wanted to do. She had lots of suggestions but always came up with new ideas and modifications in response to our goals and needs for the trip. The company has offices all over SE Asia so that when my wife had a medical emergency the Buffalo Tours office in Chiang Mai, Thailand helped with modifiying our trip and Ly must have been notified and she e-mailed us right away as well. They helped with what we needed for documentation for our trip insurance.All the guides they arranged were fantastic and they were always there at hotels, for tours and at the airport as promised. The company is perfect if you want to design your own trip and yet have the help of their expertise. They worked with our budget and at times found us upgrades which we would have not known about. Ly even came to visit us at our hotel in Hanoi which was near the end of our five weeks of touring. I have never written a review before but it is the least I could do for such good, reliable and caring service."

We cycled through the country side, saw some fishermen, some cricket harvesting, someone making spring roll wraps. At the tunnels, we saw weapons, traps, and tunnels from the wars. We had a great time, and our driver and tour guide were excellent. The tour guide gave us tips on other things about our stay in Ho Chi Minh, not just about our booked tour. He told us about which taxis are legitimate to take. That was really helpful as there were so many \"fake\" taxis that wouldn't take us all the way to our hotel and charged us 5 times the usual rate. And he suggested things we could do on our own after the tour ended. We felt very safe and comfortable with the guide and driver. They were flexible with the tour, so we only rode the bikes as much as we wanted to , then we rode in the van. The bikes were appropriate for us, and everything was on time. Emailing back and forth before the tour and booking it was easy. I can't think of anything negative to say. Honestly!"

We enjoyed it, we thought the water and scenery to be not as polluted as we expected, and yes there were other boats around but nothing to complain about, we were hesitant to book due to the bad reviews, but this boat has recently been upgraded and we would reccomed it.

We read that the company - Buffalo Tours - was priced higher than other options available, but we were glad for the convenience of booking through the hotel, and didn't find the prices unreasonable. (I believe we paid $30US per adult.) We were picked up in a private van and our tour guide provided some great context on the drive out to the tunnels. He spoke English very well and was able to answer all of our questions. He was very comfortable sharing his family's experiences with the war, and made us feel like we could ask anything. The site itself is definitely made for tourists, with some shops/tourist traps interspersed along the way. Our guide rushed us through these sections of the trip, and didn't try to pressure us in to buying anything. We all found the experience very interesting, even more so because of the information that our excellent guide shared along the way. I definitely recommend a guided trip to the tunnels to anyone visiting HCMC."

All of these boats are pretty much the same and buffalo was a pretty good operator. We were served a decent lunch and accommodations were fine. We then had a tour of a beach, kayaking and dinner. All the boats pretty much go to the same places. Our boat had a good size, about 12 passengers so at least we could avoid the crowds. The next morning we woke to go to the caves but very other boat went at the same time so tons of people. After we returned to the boat at 9am and from 10am onward were just waiting for our return van, that came at 12:30. A lot of just sitting and waiting.

My husband and I usually don't use a tour service, instead prefering to plan things ourselves. But this was our first trip to Asia and we decided to go with a tour. We found Buffalo Tours online and after a couple emails we knew they were perfect for what we wanted. We didn't want a group tour hopping on/off buses with little time at each site. Buffalo Tours planned our itinerary around what our interests were and made several recommendations on places to visit that we ended up loving.We were pleased with all our accomodations they arranged (and we were even suprised by several upgrades at the hotels). The restaurants we ate at all seemed authentic Thai or Cambodian places which was perfect. All the drivers were punctual and the guides all spoke very good English and were very informative. We really enjoyed our time in Thailand and Cambodia with a big thanks to Buffalo Tours. We would definitely recommend them and when we plan a future trip to Vietnam we would definitely plan on using them again."

Really marvelous personal service from our Vietnamese tour agent, who we worked with over Skype and email (we are in the U.S.) to plan the trip. We asked for top of the line hotels and personal guides. We received flawless service in every location with great rooms, several unexpected upgrades, and perfectly reliable transfers to and from each airport, with highly attentive local guides and drivers to make the experience highly comfortable and efficient. Friends of ours have taken nearly identical itineraries from boutique U.S. travel agencies at substantially higher prices than we paid. We also compared with several for quotes, and found that Buffalo Tours provided much better value, bypassing the middleman."

Someone met us at each stop and accompanied us except during our free time. We saw and experienced so much more than we ever would have, had we planned the trip on our own. They included a broad array of venues, types of attractions and experiences. All parts of the travel met or exceeded our expectations, and when the inevitable small problems emerged, the Buffalo Tours staff was very responsive and active in resolving them. We had wonderful hotels, excellent food, an unusually wide variety of transportation modes and interesting guides native to each region. At all times we were encouraged to adjust the plans to suit our interests. It was an unforgettable experience.The top two guides we had were Dam Vuttha in Siem Reap, Cambodia, and Tin in Saigon and the Mekong Delta. Both were completely fluent in English and very easy to communicate with and understand. They were completely knowledgeable about the complicated history of their respective countries, yet also well versed in daily culture. Each one shared with us personal stories about his family that brought to life what the experience of living in their respective countries was like. Both were also uncommonly gracious, compassionate, kind and thoughtful, and always ready to help us navigate treacherous terrain. In addition, as they got to know us better, they were able to help us fine tune our activities so we made the most of our limited time. When we left them, it was hard to say goodbye. If you are traveling in Cambodia and southern Vietnam, Vuttha and Tin will give you a truly unique experience.Patricia and Larry J, Taia E, and Gary K"

He was very responsive, and we had booked a tour in less than a week despite traveling the following week! We were happy with this.We were happy with both guides (Beer in Chiang Mai, and Ikipong in Bangkok). Ikipong was very caring, and funny. He always had a smile on his face.I have no gripes about what we did, but we did visit too many temples. I would recommend you ask for a good combination of excursions and temples/museums. You won't appreciate the temples if you visit too many. I would/should have also requested a food tour or cooking class in retrospect.The car the your company uses are too big/lavish. I would have rather paid less for a smaller car. The car and the choice of hotels would be my two complaints. For the price we paid, I think they could have still made plenty of profit while giving us a little bit nicer accommodation.That being said, overall it was a good experience and I would recommend this company to friends. We plan on using this company again when we travel to Vietnam and Cambodia later this year, although we will probably be more specific about price points.Ask for Ikipong as your tour guide when in Bangkok."

The trip was planned on the internet using an agent in Hanoi. She was very helpful and efficient, quick to respond and it only took about a week to craft the itinerary. On the ground, everything was very well organized. The guides always showed up on time (usually early) and were always willing to accommodate our schedule during the tours, spending more or less time at various locations depending on our interest. They were all very knowledgeable and outgoing, and while some had strong accents that made understanding difficult sometimes, all were very fluent in English. We learned so much about Vietnam just by talking with the guides and we got lots of good advice from them. We chose to stay in 3-star hotels, and all hotels were clean, friendly and more than adequate, and some were even quite charming. Credit card processing went fine (like others we were a bit nervous handing over credit card info to a company in Vietnam). In fact, we added on a train trip at the end when we were in Vientnam and after we had agreed to the price, they contacted us and told us it was actually going to be a bit cheaper than the quote. We would have no hesitation about recommending Buffalo tours for either day trips or for longer tours."

Most were in their 30s or 40s and were friendly, engaging and mature with a level of English that ranged from good to excellent. All were knowledgeable both about the people and places we visited.

Lunch is five star service aboard a larger boat includes cooking class and the most delicious meal.

There were no hidden fees and everything was exactly as described in the brochure. What I appreciated most was the services given to me by the booking agent, Tran Thi Thuy Nga. I showed up at their offices around 7:15pm and wanted the tour the next day. She was very patient, non pushy and generally tried to get me exactly what I was asking for. It took her a little bit of time to confirm a driver and a guide and she stayed way past the official closing time. She also gave me a card with her cell phone just in case I had any issues. The tour itself visited mostly same things as the cheaper group tours but I did get a chance to follow a local festival procession as I was alone. The only minor criticism I have is that of the tour guide who just wasn't exceptionally informative and was perhaps a bit more insistent on tips for everyone involved that necessary. The driver and the guide also said they liked working for Buffalo as they treated them well."

We ate lunch in a chain restaurant (Buffalo paid for the pho but the non-alcoholic drinks were on us!) and our guide did not take us for a beer at the end of the day as described in the itinerary. Because the locations we visited were basically museums, there was really no role for our guide. He did not add anything to the material provided by the museums, rather he left us to wander and told us he'd meet us at the exit. We also visited the market in the old quarter, one place where you'd think a guide would be value-added. He ran through the market and we practically had to beg him to stop and explain what we were seeing. At the end I asked for a recommendation on some local street food and he told me to go to a restaurant. The one stall he finally directed me to had the worst banh mi I've had during my two week stay in Vietnam! $30 is a little steep for a taxi ride to 3 locations and a bowl of pho.

We booked our trip with Buffalo tours well in advance & were delighted with the service of the guys in the office in Hanoi - Mr. Minh in particular. On arrival everything went very well & we were greeted at the airport by a 'guide' & driver. It turns out that Buffalo tours use freelance guides everywhere so these people are being paid a v. small fraction of what you have already paid to Buffalo. They are constantly looking for tips for themselves & the drivers that take you around - so much so that they will try & come into your hotel room & stand there until you either give them a tip or blatantly don't & ask them to leave. This was something that we were not ready for - by the end of the 17 trip I never wanted to see another tour guide again! We had a bad experience with the weather which obviously is not Buffalo tours fault - we were scheduled for an overnight trip to Halong bay staying on a boat. The weather was freakishly cold, we got on the bus for our 3 hour drive & there was no heat on the bus, we were all quite cheery really I suppose. It turned out that there were 2 guides on the bus - 1 would only talk to one couple 'his couple' & the other was for another group of people - it seemed we didn't have one !?! Buffalo tours then called me to see if I wanted to take the trip to Halong Bay due to the weather - hold on, I'm on the bus to Halong bay??? Then the lady in the office asked to speak to the tour guide on the bus as she didn't have his number ...... it's all a bit disorganised & strange to say the least. So we got to Halong Bay (not before stopping in another side of the road place where the guides get free coffees for bringing us mugs in to buy souvenirs & people follow you around the shop asking you to buy things) - we got out to our boat (which is not like the pictures on the website - it is much older) and once aboard we were told - there's no heat on this boat!!! We all laughed, but it was true - we have never been so cold in all our lives & we're from Ireland. The wind actually whistles through the windows as they don't shut properly - we were frozen stiff. In saying that Halong bay is so beautiful I can only imagine how gorgeous it would be on a warm summers evening with the sun setting. Other than all that we didn't really have a hitch with our plans - we met lots more guides & the further south you go, the more they look/work for tips. We did have one incident of them not picking us up for a trip and then calling about an hour & a half late which meant we missed part of our itinery - my husband was annoyed but the guide kept saying that it was our fault as the tour company gave her the wrong hotel name. She was extremely persistant in her maintaining it was our fault so much so that my husband had to ask her to stop talking about it - i think she was just worried about the tip! I think that if you could pre pay to include tips for all your guides & then be able to give out discretionary tips to the excellant guides that would be brilliant. Or even guidance from Buffalo on how the tipping system should work/ how much to give. There are a lot of stops at factories etc where people want you to buy their goods (marble statues!!) - I think that if they could cut out that also it would make for a more enjoyable trip. This was the only bad thing about the Buffalo tours experience - they tailor made our trip to suit what we wanted to see. We really saw a lot of beautiful Vietnam & would got back in a heart beat. They organised our 'Visa on arrival' which worked out brilliantly and the hotels etc were lovely. My favourite spot was Hoi An - where you can get clothes made, they make such beautiful clothes - I brought a skirt with me from home & got 3 copies made for about USD 90. I wear them all the time, such good quality & value. The Vietnamese people are lovely & we met lots of happy travellers along the way from Australia and the UK. The only negative for us was not understanding the way Buffalo sub contract the tour guide work, the tipping and the stops at these factories etc along the way - it just got tiresome. Of course everyone has to make money & these people survive on tourism so I understand it from their point of view but if I could have paid an extra USD 300 to tips everyone beforehand I would have to curb the entering our room/ telling us we were gorgeous etc it was just a bit uncomfortable. Buffalo have a house in North Vietnam in a town called Mai Chau - it was so wonderful, you should definately include this in your trip if you can. Would I use Buffalo again .....hhhmmm probably not since i have been to this part of the world & think I could do it myself for a better price but I would recommend them once you know what you're getting!"

            "review": "Great local knowledge, superb execution on a custom trip.. Most of the reviews of Buffalo Tours on TripAdvisor seem to refer to their group tours \u2013 this review is a little different as we used Buffalo to set up a custom itinerary for us, touring Hanoi, Sapa, and Halong Bay.They did a great job and we were delighted by the trip. We dealt with Hanh, and she suggested a great itinerary incorporating the main sights in Hanoi, overnight train to Sapa with treks to some of the local villages, and a private junk cruise on Halong Bay. She did a great job of understanding the type of trip we were seeking and made some great suggestions that we\u2019d never have discovered on our own.Once we arrived in Vietnam, the attention to detail was really superb. We received a detailed itinerary a few days ahead of our trip outlining everything that had been planned for us. We arrived at Hanoi airport to meet our guide, and after that, everything worked like clockwork. All of our reservations were exactly as we\u2019d expected; entry tickets and paperwork had been arranged ahead of time for everything we visited; and car transfers were efficient and the driver was always on time. Our guide was great \u2013 he spoke perfect English and knew a great deal about the entire county of Vietnam. No matter what we saw or what we wanted to talk about, he seemed to be well-informed and able to convey a lot of information.The only drawback of our trip was the included meals \u2013 while the standard was high, the restaurants chosen quite clearly cater to tourists. Set menus were prearranged, but judging from the dishes selected the food is designed to please Western palates rather than really exploring the local cuisine. The best food we had on the trip was on the boat \u2013 locally sourced seafood, expertly prepared and much more creative cooking than what we\u2019d eaten in Hanoi or Sapa. We also did a cooking course (arranged by Buffalo) at the Hanoi Cooking Centre \u2013 highly recommended and great fun.I was surprised (and pleased) to get a phone call from the booking office in the middle of my trip -- they'd managed to track us down on our junk trip in the middle of Halong Bay -- to check in with us and make sure that everything was going to plan and that we were enjoying our trip. It showed a real attention to good customer service, and this was evident throughout our trip.Scheduling a detailed itinerary in a country like Vietnam is tough. I don\u2019t usually like to use tour companies, but I was very pleasantly surprised with Buffalo \u2013 our personalised itinerary really covered exactly what we wanted to see, with none of the hassles that you might expect if you were doing-it-yourself (eg, haggling with taxis, getting lost, dealing with touts, etc) and with some conveniences that we would have overlooked (day rooms near the train station to freshen up before/after the overnight train, for example). It\u2019s a little more expensive than planning everything yourself, but for us it was money well spent. I would use Buffalo Tours again if I returned to Vietnam, and we were so impressed with them that we\u2019re now investigating what they have to offer elsewhere in Asia. Highly recommended!"

Here are some reasons why.* We were never picked up and after several phone calls a car was arranged to meet up with the bus. This meant we missed a stop in a local workshop, which we paid for.* It was as if the driver was in practice for raceday at Silverstone as he weaved around traffic, almost forgetting that the traffic goes two ways. 2 very near misses.* On the trip home we had extra stops, whIch the tour company arranged with one couple, to compensate for a previous error. This added an extra 2 hours to our already late arrival time. Was nice of the tour company to notify us that they were putting us in a random village, which wasn't in the itinerary.Thankfully the scenery of Halong Bay made this trip worthwhile."

On the way home we had to locate our driver, he dis not cone to us and we were meant to be back at 3pm, many of us had other tours to meet, he did 2 additional unplanned 2 hour stops, needless to stay everyone was very annoyed!

We do not usually use tours but as we planned to travel in January with a mixed group of family (with two of our group aged under ten years and two over seventy years) we tried out a couple of tour groups in North Vietnam. Buffalo was excellent. Mr. Minh was helpful, responsive and reliable in setting up the tours. Their staff in Hanoi were prompt and then patient when we weren't. The guide was exceptionally well informed (my apologies that I can not remember his name). His only flaw being that he was not sensitive to the kids having limits to how much info they could take in. When we squeezed in the art museum on a whim he arranged it very quickly AND new the collection and was a good guide. Shared a bus to the hills for four hours. Wish we had a private transfer. Other passengers hogged the best seats for the whole trip! small bus has small suspension, sitting down the back for four hours when you have back problems can be tough! I wish people would be considerate enough to rotate seats. The only problems we had on this trip were not connected with Buffalo but were with other operators. Except for one thing and that was being taken to touristic lacquer/gift shops. We did not arrange them but somehow were taken to them anyway! Easy enough to just leave though! We used Buffalo for Mai Chau, Hanoi and partially for Halong Bay."

My wife & myself joined a Full Day Ho Chi Minh City Private Tour on 25 Dec 2009, and the next day, the Cai Be Princess Group Tour (Mekong River Cruise), both by Buffalo Tours. The Cai Be Princess Group Tour is above average experience, while the Full Day Ho Chi Minh City Private Tour is just okay with some problems. The problem is Bruce (obviously, an alias), the guide. No. 1, Bruce did not bring us to see the Giac Lam Pagoda. He told us there was heavy traffic going there due to some construction going-on. He offered another temple in the city, I said okay because I don't really know the city. Later I found out from other local people that the traffic was just normal, and it could be that Bruce doesn't want to bring us there because it is some distance from downtown. All the other places we visited were in downtown. No wonder we finished our itinerary by 02:30 pm (the itinerary says the tour finishes at approx. 06:00 pm when we will be transferred back to our hotel), and back to our hotel at 3:10 pm after I requested to stop-by a supermarket to buy something. No.2, Bruce brought us to a souvenir shop which is actually a \"tourist trap\" and not in the itinerary of Buffalo Tours. The shop is near the War Remnants Museum, it is a one-door 2-level shop selling souvenirs, bags, foods, etc. Bruce told us to have a free cup of coffee there, and maybe buy something. Fortunately, we did not accept the free cup of coffee. But the sales lady kept on pestering us to buy something, so we just bought a small figurine at a cost of US$14. Days later at Hanoi airport (inside the departure lounge), we saw the exact figurine and the price is US$4 (yes, four not fourteen)."

When we asked the tour guide what was going on, he blamed the booking office and said he had told them many times not to promise this event as it was inconsistent. No effort to compensate us for the absence of that evening of entertainment, just an excuse. The guide was strangely unwilling to give information about the tour area unless solicited by us, and at times, he was just unpleasant.

We managed six great stops, working our way through an array of classic morning dishes, snacks, lunch/dinner meals and desserts. The tour had little extras (while you are digesting) like riding across Long Bi\u00ean Bridge, (a historic cantilever bridge across the Red River), wandering into the backparts of shops and into Old Quarter living areas) that you wouldn't usually get to see). Fantastic 3 hours, highly recommended. Nga also wrote down all our dishes so I could blog later, gave us her egg-coffee recipe and recommended a few other places for dinner (once we can eat again). One tip - the office is on a corner at 74 Hang Bac in the heart of the Old Quarter (the sign above says Kim's Tours). Easy to just book there, they speak English."

Nga was very knowledgeable and knew of all the great spots to take us. If you are looking for a something fun to do I recommend booking this!!"

We were picked up directly from our hotel at 5:45 PM and enjoyed trying lots of new dishes across the city. The drivers were so sweet, safe and fun! We felt it was a great way to see the city and try restaurants we ordinarily wouldn't have known about. We were VERY full at the end of the evening. Nga was especially wonderful and educated us on lots of history as well as the current culture. We didn't want to leave her at the end of the tour! Can't recommend this tour enough! Such a great time in a great city!"

Her English is among the best I have encountered in Vietnam, which is especially impressive since she has never traveled to an English speaking country before. She took us to many different places and we were so stuffed towards the end of it that we had to ask to not eat anymore. She also knows a lot about history and was able to explain a lot of it while taking us sightseeing. She is very witty and also an excellent driver.Her friend that drove the other scooter (didn't catch her name) was very sweet. Her English was limited so we didn't get to communicate as much, but she was still an excellent co-pilot and safe driver. We did the 4 hour night tour, which I highly recommend as Hanoi livens up in a different way at night and many sight-seeing places light up. Come very hungry because you will be doing a lot of eating! PS - Don't be worried if you're scared of riding in the scooter at first. I love that type of stuff so I thought it was fun, but riding in Hanoi traffic can be overwhelming at first. Not to fret - Nga and her friend were completely in control of the scooter and I didn't once feel unsafe. Hold onto the bar at the underneath your seat if you want to feel more secure."

Our family of four was very keen to do a motorbike street food tour in Hanoi after being rained out on a similar tour for two nights in Saigon. We chose Hanoi Motorbike Street Foods based on positive reviews on this site and their reasonable pricing. We took the 3hr tour starting at 6pm and had a very memorable evening. Annie and the team were fantastic guides and hosts from the moment we set off from the tour office. Their scooter driving skills in the chaotic Hanoi traffic was amazing and our teenage children loved every minute of being on the back of the bikes. We visited 6 or 7 different food stops, all unique, delicious and covering a wide spectrum of local dishes. Annie was a great guide, explaining the background of each dish, how it should be eaten and adding some extra amusing stories. Thoroughly recommend this tour to anyone wanting to get a taste of real Hanoi street food combined with the excitement of acting like a local on the back of a scooter!! Definitely a highlight of our Vietnam trip."

We were brought to 6 different food stalls specialising different dishes from bun cha to egg coffee. Our guide was very knowledgeable and shared insiders information about the food dishes. Very enjoyable experience. She even list all the dishes we tried ( see photo).

They have very kind guides and scooter drivers, and you know, they are really friendly. Phoenix (the guide driver) and her friend (sorry i forgot her name) took us to the very delicious street foods in Hanoi.What i can't forget is, rather than clients, they look like best friends who hang out together in the night.We talked a lot about funny things while enjoying the food just like we are be friend from so many times ago. That's what make your foods become tastier and tastier, right?In the end of tour, we then drunk together at the very popular bar area in Hanoi, near to their office. We are very happy for that. Really.There is something make me sad even this time, i promised to Phoenix to drink wine together in our last stay in Honey but unfortunately, me and my boyfriend got accident. We couldn't go anywhere after that. So pity..Anyways, thanks a lot to this new friend. I really hope we can hang out again someday, Phoenix!And you guys who read this, I recommend you to try this tour and feel it on your own!Love,Hana and Kihoon"

I was picked up from My hotel by Sam and given my first invigorating experience on the back of a scooter through the streets of Hanoi and the Old Quarter, to the main office for payment. Then it was straight into the tour. Our tour, which was a small group, myself and a family of 3, was hosted by Money. I cannot recommend her enough. Considerate, thoughtful and extremely organised, and with one of our tour guests having a nut allergy, was on the ball with all the places we visited. All the food was FANTASTIC!!!!!! I cannot fault any of the dishes. Fresh, colorful and extremely tasty. Money explained all the food at each venue, it's cultural significance and how it may vary from the same dish in southern Vietnam. I won't go into detail of the food at each stop; it's nice to be surprised, but there is a great variety. The option for seconds is there, by all means take advantage, but I can guarantee it most likely won't be needed. Money will make sure you do not go home with an empty bellyMoney, Sam and the rest of the girls will keep you safe on the busy Hanoi roads and ensure you have a great experience of Hanoi. This tour is a great way to experience a part of Hanoi at night, and on the back of a scooter it's quite a bit cooler.

The tour takes in some of the less touristy sites like the West Lake and the metal bridges, but we also spent quite a bit of time at the HCM mausoleum without the crowds. This is a great tour which gives you a unique insight in daily life for Hanoi residents....and is such fun."

Needless to say, every place we stopped at served great Vietnamese food and most of the people sitting next to us were locals so everything felt pretty authentic. I truly believe there is no better way to experience the real hustle and bustle of this exhilarating city than this option.

But for us, we had been saving ourselves during the day and we definitely felt full after the tour.The only downside that I can think of, is that we were subjected to Hanoi's crazy traffic. There were many instances where I felt a bit uneasy riding on the back of a moped through the madness of Hanoi's roads; but that is something that applies to any city tour in Vietnam, and if anything, Phoenix and our other guide were both very experienced drivers and did the best to make us feel safe.All in all, it was a great experience and the food was amazing.

She did such a great job in showing us around and told us a bit about Vietnam history. It was a real eye opener! However, we thought $45 USD for 3 hrs (or $59 USD for 4hrs) was way too expensive especially for Vietnam standards. Even in Europe we get free walking tours and only tip the guide however much we like. In my opinion the tour worths about $20 USD. With the price in mind I'd only recommend it to people who have short amount of time in Hanoi and who doesn't mind spending."

All 4 bike drivers were university students or recent graduates, very polite and safe drivers. The drive across Long Bi\u00ean bridge to eat fresh clams by the river was a highlight for us, washed down with a home brew rice spirit. The egg coffee stop is really worth it. Pop out the back to see how they whip it up. Very typical of the ingenious can-do Vietnamese people! Loved everything we ate and went back to the bun cha restaurant for breakfast next day. Which is why you should do this tour early in your trip as you may want to revisit some places. "

Rocked up to the office planning to do the walking tour, but changed to the scooter at the last minute, despite missing the evening group they hastily organised a guide for the 3 hour gastronomic and visual tour of Hanoi. My guide Hien/Cherry was great, friendly and knowledgeable and most importantly an excellent and safe scooter driver. If you're larger than the average bear, ask for Cherry as her Honda Lead has a very comfy and large rear seat - which is far more comfy than the smaller bikes. Despite it being only the second time in my life on a motorbike, I felt completely safe and thoroughly enjoyed the ride through the city, the traffic wasnt that bad on a friday night and it was an awesome way to see the lights and sights with the cool evening breeze around you. Ditch the taxi or limo and dont hesitate to hop on the back of a scooter (but not from the dodgy looking touts that are all over the city offering rides), there is no better way to see and experience the sights at night. Havent done the walking tour but I would think the scooter is the far better option as you cover a lot more ground and get to see the sights. Do it on your first night in Hanoi as you will gain an excellent orientation of the city and it will help you get your bearings when you explore the city on your own later. The food was fantastic, some dishes you can find at your neighborhood vietnamese restaurant back home and others which are a little more exotic (like the egg coffee), but all delicious. Its always interesting to see the differences in taste and presentation etc between local and foreign versions of the same dishes - the bahn my, bo bia and modern pho were the highlights. The desert, a simple fruit, yogurt and rice combo was a refreshingly way to end the tour. Highly recommended, its an awesome way to see the night lights of the city, get your bearings around town, and have a monumental feed at the same time. Cherry was proactive and wrote down a list of all the food /stalls we went to and added a few more recommendations. Strangely, if you pay in USD it works out a little cheaper than the VND option (45 vs 1.035m), and credit cards incur a 3% surcharge which they should absorb really."

This was the second best part of our Hanoi trip (#1 was Halong Bay, of course...). Quite an adventure riding the bikes through town and stopping at great local (and clean) places to eat. We were a little worried about getting sick but that lucky did not happen thanks to our guides taking us to good places. Highly recommend this tour! Make you have have the traditional hot coffee while there too!"

Our guide, \"Money\" (Nga) was excellent; she was smart, attentive and very knowledgable about the food having grown up in a restaurant. Her English was impeccable and she made our evening fun and informative, with lots of history and cultural points of interest. The most fun was getting ferried through the traffic by the girls and experiencing scootering Hanoi style. Thank you so much Money, and good luck with your restaurant. Highly recommended."

I had reserved our places on the tour before we arrived, and to my surprise the office was the next road up to the hotel. We choose the 11am tour as I wanted to see the sights in the daytime. My husband and I had 2 young university students taking us around. We have never seen so many scooters in our entire life travelling those street. I explained to our guide that I was unfamiliar to bike riding as she took it very steady. It was great fun. We visited 7 street food locations and ate a variety of foods. To Europeans eating soup with noodles and spices is a bit strange for breakfast but hey we just went with it. Egg coffee is a little odd as well, very rich. We saw all the main sights and returned after 4 hours. By Vietnam standards, it is quite expensive, but we thought it was entertaining and fun so worth the money."

I have spent 4 weeks in Vietnam eating all from the fanciest to farmer food in the villages. Still, this was new and a learnt a lot, not only about food but we also discussed culture and history, as well as some of the life outside Hanoi. Ms Nga speaks english very well and are happy to discuss all kinds of matters. She's a fun and positive person. Traffic in Hanoi is slow and not as chaotic as it may seem when standing on the side. A great way to start a Vietnamese journey. I will do this again if I return. Do come hungry, there are lot of stops and much good food :-)"

We were ferried from shop to shop, in a variable Hanoi drizzle.The selection of food was indeed above average on the taste scale and it didn't stop! We were whisked from one place to another in quick succession.The food that we consumed cost very little, but what we are paying is the local knowledge. Would've liked a little more information about the sights along the way though. Maybe the rain made it difficult.Riding a scooter is fun. Exploring a city is fun.

I love sampling local foods so I booked street food tours with three different tour companies, and based on the comparison that I've been able to make, I would highly recommend the Hanoi Motorbike Street Foods tour. I had Nga as my tour guide and motorbike driver. She also led the group and did a fantastic job explaining the foods, providing stories about how dishes came to be, the history of the street vendor and even pointing out local and historical attractions. I had such a great experience that as soon as the tour was over, I immediately booked another one for the following night. I requested Nga and she/tour operator was very kind to accommodate me. On the second night, we went to different street vendors all across Hanoi and the food was just as terrific. Nga chose a series of foods/a menu that was varied, interesting and balanced. I savoured each bite, wanting to have more and knowing I won't be back in Hanoi for quite some time. Try to ask for Nga as your guide, they will try to accommodate, but I'm sure all of the guides are fantastic."

We all had a great time - Our tour guide, Money (Ha) was extremely informative, personable and fluent. She and her scooter crew took us around to 5 places to eat - which I had initially thought was going to be too much food, but it ended up to be the perfect amount. I especially LOVED the coconut+fermented sugar wraps that we got off of a street vendor. I have some dietary restrictions which normally can be worrying but in this case, Money made adjustments at every stop, just for me. And she was always thorough in explaining what was in the food so that I didn't need to worry. Not only did we check out street food, Money took us around to show us the city which was a nice break.

First and foremost, the selection of food was absolutely fantastic, covering all the popular street foods, some that are localized to Hanoi only. Money was incredibly knowledgeable (I don't really think there's a question about Hanoi that she doesn't know the answer to, haha!) and she was able to give us the nitty gritty details of the political history, myths and legends, all interlaced with charming humor and intelligent articulation. She provided us with information and recommendations about food and places to visit for our trips to other cities as well which we were greatly appreciative of - its always better when a local makes recommendations in a country where the language and culture is completely foreign to you. Given the sheer overwhelming amount of options in Hanoi for food, I'd definitely recommend getting started with this tour to get a head start on this wonderful city :)"

We were not disappointed, as the locations we travelled were actually some distance away!We went with a group of 5 friends and as soon as we were introduced to Nga, we knew we were in for a good night.We then hopped onto a scooter driven by a friendly local, most of them students or doing this on top of studying/working other jobs and were taken to several locations to experience street food all around Hanoi. We also stopped off at several locations and learnt about the history and culture of each part.Getting to each destination was half the fun and not even the rain could quell our excitement, in fact it just added to the whole experience. In addition, they do offer pickup and drop off to your hotel, so travel isn't an issue. All in all, one of the best experiences we've had during our time in Vietnam!"

My tour only lasted about 3.5 hours probably due to it being a Monday when the actual mausoleum is closed so the tourist doesn't have to stand in line for a half hour in order to get a few second glimpse of a mummy.Others have complimented Money, the guide, I won't repeat what's already (truthfully) been said, but will point out that she is a fantastic driver. I won't give my credentials here as the review is not about me, but about a tour I took. Money's skill derives from her having a good understanding of the road as well as a well developed sense of anticipation. She is both safety conscious and very considerate. I could tell this by the fact that many scooters passed us. She drove slowly for my benefit.Recommended"

She was also very flexible and made a switch from one temple to a prison tour to match my interests. This was done within the time range given for all venues.  Special mention needs to be given to the walking tour to access Hanoi's popular street food and best dining spots. I recommend that you take this on your first day in Hanoi so that you could make a return visit to one or 7 of the top venues listed. It was all very well arranged as each item complemented the palate. It ended with beer and coffee, like a 7 course dinner on the go! We were all full by the time it ended. What a night!Many of the guides are from high school or work part-time as college students and their youthful exuberance was infectious. This is one reason why the tours were so successful and enjoyable. It wasn't transactional at all."

Seeing around a house in the old quarter was really amazing and the egg coffee was a very tasty treat at the end of the evening. I even left my scarf behind at one of the restaurants and they kindly took a detour so that we could retrieve it! Nothing was too much trouble for the guides and drivers who were all fantastic young women. It felt like we were part of a local group on a night out and it was a fantastic experience. We would never have been able to try these foods or eat in these places if we had been travelling alone.

The highest scooter density I've ever witnessed which even turns crossing the street into an adventure anytime as you just have to start walking, keeping your fingers crossed and hoping for the best. Miraculously, it works - at least so far it has... So what else would be more suitable than hopping on such a 2-wheeled device and become part of the traffic-craziness?! And thus, we booked a tour on a scooter with these friendly guys. We actually booked the 4 hours sightseeing + food tour, but we seemed to have gotten something else in the end since the tour lasted only 3 hours and also was cheaper than announced. In hindsight that was a pity since we could have easily spent more time with our 2 lovely tour guides: Money and Alice. And that brings me to the best part of the tour. Money and Alice were doing the driving while we sat on the back which - to be honest - was probably the smarter way to go, than vice versa. Especially Money is amazingly knowledgeable. She seems to know everyone by person and knows the streets like the back of her hand. It's also really fun chatting with both guides as their English is superb. Thus, you can easily chat the time away, while on the bikes or while eating. Money turned out to be a little fan of Lionel Messi ;-). So, while I was mostly busy wondering how there are so few accidents given their way of driving, Money magically navigates to all those nice spots to try the street food. And that brings me to the second best part of the tour. Hanoi is something else, also when it comes to street food. Finding it is the tricky part though. But in that department, Money is an expert. I won't go into details here but rest assured that you can trust those guides and just try everything they offer you. They'll ask for allergies etc in the beginning so that's taken care of right at the start. Last but not least, there was some sightseeing as well, which I really appreciated. Honestly, without those breaks in between I would have simply bursted due to all that good food. Money and Alice gave nice background information about everything we wanted to know. All in all, we'd do it again and time. I highly recommend doing any of those tours. Ask for Money and Alice as guides."

I was strangely comfortable on the back of the scooter racing through narrow alleys and crossing crazy intersections. The food part of the tour was also excellent. We eat a lot of Vietnamese food at home in Seattle, but we are rarely adventurous. We went to 9 different places and tried 15 different things. We were stuffed by the end. Everything we tasted was good, although we had our favorites. Lily was very funny with her mix of practiced jokes as well as many good ones on the fly. The other thing I really liked about this type of tour is that we got out of the Old Quarter and into areas that tourists don't normally go. She also mixed in sightseeing in between the food stops. We saw where John McCain crashed, the oldest pagoda in town, the government buildings, Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum, and the West Lake. Due to the thrill of the motorbike ride, the excellence of the food, the charming guides this was probably the best tour I have been on. Good job Lily, I hope you get your \"Miss\" title :)."

Upon receiving confirmation (I booked two weeks in advance), I was supposed to be all set with a pick up from my hostel at 6pm. When no one showed up, I called to check in, and was hung up on. I didn't know if the tour was happening - if someone was coming for me or not - which was very upsetting and frustrating. But Money was so sweet when she came to pick me up (the mix up was not her fault; it was the office/scheduling) that I couldn't possibly stay upset and quickly forgot about the hiccup. I would have given fewer stars because of the poor scheduling and awful customer service on the part of the office, but Money was so wonderful and the tour itself such a fantastic experience, that I had to give Money the five stars she deserves!

On top of that, riding on a motorbike through Hanoi is such an exhilarating experience. At the end of the tour, Money wrote down a list of all of the places we visited and what we are so that I could go back to those places the next time I was in town.

Hopping on the back of a scooter driven by a local is the best way to go. It's not a generic food tour either, it'll begin by your guide asking you about what you've had so far and/or what you like or would like to try. We had a magnificent 3-hours with Lily, Mia, and Jane. You needn't finish your food, you will undoubtedly be beyond capacity by the end of the tour. Biggest tip is to do the evening food tour.. it's too hot during the day, plus evening food is more savory. They wrote us a transcript of all the places we visited, with the dishes we got, at the end of the evening, but I would definitely consider doing this every single time I visit Hanoi. Also you'll get a little bit of local history during your ride if you're alert and paying attention.My absolute favorite was Bun cha for kebab rice noodles.Thank you, LIly Mia & Jane"

Same story with the foods. However, I don't know how to do either safely. Moni and Annie can take care of you on both accounts. Riding with an experienced Hanoi rider is a kick. Seeing what is going on from that side is so much fun and a totally different view. Even as a control freak who has never been a passenger on a bike as an adult, I felt comfortable and relaxed. I had no sense that they didn't know what was going on. Annie was cool, calm and collected when she wasn't mentioning that it was cold. Poor girl. It was down to 60 degrees or so and raining. Coming from Seattle it felt like a beautiful June day to me so it became a good source or harassing her which is perfect because they have a great sense of humor.The food was great. A huge variety was had. Instead of guessing at what was there, Moni had a great breakdown for each. And the volume... at the last stop I couldn't finish my Bahn Mi. Visiting Vietnam has been like visiting my wife's aunt who doesn't speak English except to tell me to eat more. These folks want you to enjoy their food and it's pretty darn good in terms of quality and taste. Take this tour and have an adventure in Vietnam that you'll otherwise miss. Seriously, you'd walk right by these places and their tiny fancy plastic chairs and have no idea what you would be missing. Just make sure you start this tour hungry. Like preparing for Thanksgiving hungry. You won't believe the volume of food these 90 lb girls expect you to eat."

There are three things you need to do in Hanoi: Try the food (and lots of it), ride on a motorbike (and as much as you can) and see Ho Chi Minh (once). We combined those things on our 4-hour morning tour with Money and Annie. Of all the great tour guides that we met in Vietnam, Money was the most outspoken, interesting and fun to be around with. The food is obviously amazing. If you want to try something, speak up and they will absolutley individualize the tour for you. A must do, in my opinion, and a great way to start of your Hanoi experience."

The scooter & traffic scene in Hanoi (and HoChiMinh) is not for the faint-of-heart! Even seasoned motorcyclists from the West would be nervous to ride here. Me and my buddy signed up and soon thereafter two girls and two scooters showed up to pick us up for the start of 3 hours of incredible fun! Helmet was provided and jumped on the back with the girls weaving in and out of the insanity to the first of many street food destinations ranging from pho to various crispy pancakes, duck egg (with a baby duck in it), zooming thru tiny narrow alley ways and onto broad boulevards to HoChiMinh tomb and gorgeous WestLake. The guides Lilly & Mia were masters of the scooter and nothing fazed them staring down trucks & buses who would dare challenge us. More than once we mounted the side walk to make progress; it felt like a James Bond chase at times! Not only that our guides were extremely witty and cracked jokes about the food, the traffic, the cops throughout. I have rarely been entertained so much in my live. The food, the traffic, the side streets of Hanoi, the amazing food, talking to wonderful people, the stunning scenery of Old Hanoi. You will NOT forget this tour and it was the best $40 I have ever spent!Just do this, when you get to Hanoi and have ~ 3 hours to spare and if you are hungry.

There was a little rain and the girls kindly nipped off to get us plastic ponchos. Nothing was too much trouble. The girls spoke good English and were really fun to be with making jokes and adding something very special to the tour.We couldn't have had a better start to trip. Thank you so much Lily, Mia, Jane and Kat!!Mark, Rebecca, Molly and Hughie"

Before we booked the scooter food tour, we weren't sure if it would be worth the $45 US but Lily and Jane proved to be fantastic, informative, and cheery hosts.

I am so pleased with the tour\u2014now I have an arsenal of new foods and drinks as my go-to in Vietnam. Lily and Jane were great drivers, helping us blend in with the locals in the bustling Hanoi streets. Thanks a lot! We had a great time with you, girls!CheersJ"

We are completely stuffed and very satisfied. In addition our guides showed us the major sights in the city as well as shared a lot about what its like living in Vietnam.We were initially skeptical because the price seemed high for Vietnam but we are very glad we did it."

One of the reasons we went to Vietnam was to try as much street food as possible, so we booked a number of street food tours across the country. The tour we received from Money and Hannah was definitely the best.While we we're indulging ourselves on all the cuisines, we received background knowledge on not only the food but Vietnamese culture in general. It was just fun hanging out, talking and laughing. It was also heaps of fun riding around on the back of scooter!In 3.5 hours we managed to fit in a real diverse range of dishes (the most out of all the tours We did), Money also left us with further suggestions of places to try in our remaining days in Hanoi. Based on the information provided we are keen to give these dishes a try when we get home!Would recommend!"

My boyfriend and I had just returned from a very long car ride 6 hours north of Hanoi, and were absolutely exhausted by the time it was time for the food tour. We were a bit skeptical of the safety initially due to the crazy traffic, but the second we each hopped on to the backs of our respective tour guide's motorbikes, it was just FUN FUN FUN from there. Both Lily and Mia are exceptionally knowledgable and brought us to some of the best places! There is no way we would've been able to find these gems without these girls. They take you to authentic Vietnamese places that locals go to. My only other piece of advice is, if you're doing the night tour (which I think is best), eat a light lunch! You will be stuffed by the end of this trip! Thanks again Lily and Mia!"

First of all make sure you show up with an empty stomach because theres a lot of food and you need room for all of it.

What happens is 2 girls come and pick you up on their bikes from your hotel. Then they take you around the Old Quarter to various local eateries... and I do mean LOCAL. They don't take you to the boring westernized restaurants specifically catering for tourists. The things you will try are the sort of things you probably never would have tried if you don't do this tour. They give you plenty of info on the history of the city along the way. A very rich cultural experience. Our main tour guide was Pixie. She was very caring and attended to our all needs. Both Pixie and the other guide (sorry don't remember her name) were very safe drivers/riders maneuvering through the busy streets of Hanoi. I think this tour is a must when in Hanoi. You know the saying \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\". Well this is your best opportunity to immerse yourself in the life of the locals and go to places where you won't see many tourists.Thanks PixieAlex & Marina"

I can't lie, I was a bit scared as the wind howled and the rain poured down but Money's bike handling skills were outstanding. I didn't feel unsafe for a minute, it just added to the adventure and gave me yet another funny story to tell on my return to normal world.... We went to various fab street food places, each time Money explained the origin, ingredients, got me cooking and making my own, got me drinks (defo needed a beer after the thunder storm), plus took me on a grand sightseeing tour of the city, explaining various historic monuments and stories. She taught me more than a guide I had in a city walk :) Anyway, overall amazing and highly recommended! Ask for Money, she is awesome."

We would recommend this tour to be done your first day in Hanoi so that you can revisit some food places or ask our lovely guides for recommendations on certain type of food you'd like to try! It was a little hard ordering street food on or own prior to the tour as it is not easy to spot certain foods when you dont understand vietnamese or speak vietnamese, as we notice most street food vendors don't really speak english (at least for the few we attempted). We rode on the back of our guide's scooter and that alone was so much fun cruising around the whole city with a combination of sightseeing and food with the wind in your face! Our guides were very patient, professional, fun and speaks very good english. We learnt a lot on that day with them about Hanoi and food. Would definitely recommend this tour, and on your first day! We were deciding between walking tour vs scooter tour as the scooter costs quite a bit more, but never regretted it - the scooter ride itself was fun and the whole tour was effortless as it was quite hot and humid if we were to do it on foot. Thanks a lot Lily & Mia! Thumbs up for our wonderful guides! Thank you for the great experience :)"

Everybody knows the best way to experience other cultures is to eat the local cuisine, and Lily and Jane did such an amazing job sharing this with us. We got to try a good range of food and drinks (so much food!) and saw parts of the city that we certainly would not have seen without a guide. Cutting through narrow back alleys on the bikes was super cool!We did the night tour which I would strongly recommend, it's more active on the streets and all the lights in the city make it an extra special experience. Lily and Jane were awesome guides!"

On the backs of motorbikes with the breeze and lights in our faces we made our way through a small world of street eating. Warning - be really hungry. Just to mention a few dishes - first time I've had vegetarian pho, egg coffee, and a fusion bowl of creme caramel and Asia sweets such as black sticky rice. Yum for the three of them - but all the food was great. Lily and Mia explained the ingredients in every dish we tried; we laughed a lot; their enthusiasm for their job was infectious.

It will be wise to let them know that you want to stop in certain attractions so that they can plan for it."

Motorbikes are in abundance in Hanoi and crossing the street can be described as a nerve racking experience. However, we never felt unsafe riding behind Cheryl and Lily in our food tour. They took us around the Old Quarter and explained some landmarks and some history. They catered the tour to our liking and it was great fun to just talk to them and learn about each other. Memorable dishes were the bun bo nam bo, rolled pho, and of course the egg coffee. It was also interesting to see the restaurant workers calling for the motorbike drivers to stop at their restaurant - some would even go in front of our guides and try and corral you into the restaurant. But this doesn't phase Cheryl and Lily as they continue forward to take us to where they think the best eats are. We definitely recommend this tour to everyone.

The girls we had as riders are delightful and really make the tour, their knowledge, their humour and their openness. The only negative for us was thinking afterwards that the tour is overpriced for what it is and I am certain the girls doing the work and using their own bikes don't get to reap the benefit. The girls are all smile and laugh all the same and if you have the money then I would recommend for this reason alone. Steve and Gayle"

On the recommendation of a very good friend, I booked the Hanoi Street Foods Tour for myself and three friends on our last day in Hanoi. My only mistake was not booking it on the first day.For 20 USD per person, we spent three hours eating like KINGS and getting a tour of Hanoi, to boot! I could not believe the amount of food were expected to eat! Our tour guide, Ms. Moon, had just graduated from University with a degree in English Tourism. She was fabulous. Though her accent is pronounced, her English is good. She is exceptionally knowledgeable about all things Hanoian, and she is funny. An excellent guide.Now, make no mistake. This is street food. You will be eating in (or in front of) establishments that you would normally pass by because with your western sensibility, you would be sure these places will give you dysentery or at the very least, Uncle Ho\u2019s Revenge. I am pleased to report that you would be wrong and Uncle Ho is laying revenge-free in his giant mausoleum.We met Ms. Moon at her office, which was just down the street from our hotel, The Oriental Central Hotel on Hang Bac street, in Hanoi\u2019s Old Town. She asked if we had any dietary restrictions and smiled when we said we had none.We must have eaten in at least 10 places, all of which are famous in Hanoi and were established between 25 and 70 years ago. We were the only westerners in each establishment, that\u2019s how good the food was. We ate:Bun Rieu Cua - Grilled mini-crab cakes in tamarind broth and rice vermicelliCha ca - Turmeric Fish with Dill SoupSpring rolls and fried Pillow Cakes - filled with pork and mushrooms and wonderfulnessFresh Water Chestnuts - Ever have one of those mealy, disgusting starchy things from a can? Be prepared to have your socks blown off. This little gem tastes exactly like fresh young coconut.Banh Xeo (Rice crepes filled with pork and mushrooms or with eggs) - you get to sit there and watch a woman spoon thin rice batter onto a silk screen and steam each crepe individually. Served hot with fish sauce.Bun Cha - Grilled Pork and Noodle SoupFried Banana in Rice PastrySpicy or Sweet Donut CakeEgg Coffee - Don\u2019t worry, just try it.Cold beerPho Ga - Sliced chicken in an anise and dill broth.My advice? Skip breakfast and book a 10 or 11 AM tour with Ms. Moon on your first full day in Hanoi. You won\u2019t be disappointed. And you won\u2019t need to eat again until the next day."

A bonus of the tour was finding out the \"real\" prices of these dishes at each establishment! One thing we might suggest...although we were given some instruction on how to eat most of the dishes, we would have benefited greatly from actual demonstrations by the guide(s)! There was more than enough food at each stop for the guide to use for a demo. It was really nice having the assistant Blue along to help herd and protect us at the back of the line and chat with us when Lucky wasn't accessible. Overall we thought the 3 hour tour was decent value for the $20 US (840.000 VND) and beneficial for identifying and ordering Vietnamese street food...we were stuffed!!"

It was also slightly too many to get close to our guide and hear what he was saying over the street noise. Our guide Phuoc was kind and quite informative but didn't ask if there was anything we particularly wanted to try and although we asked about some dishes he didn't stop to buy us any - unlike other reviewers have noted.

We had very little interaction with Lucky to start. He introduced himself to us but did not ask the group where anyone was from to try to encourage group interaction. Although a portion - seven of the eleven - were a grouchy family, which made it tougher on Lucky, he did not try much to engage any of us.We headed out in a straight line to our first stop for pho ga (chicken pho). This was bland and boring but a good way to start, by easing us into street food. Lucky did not eat with us. He explained the dish a little and then just let us eat. He never asked if anyone liked it. He just said, \"are you done? Let's go.\" So we headed to the next stop for b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n (rolled cake with mushrooms and pork). This dish was delicious and the stand out of the night for us. We then went to two other places and ended at the egg coffee which was very unique.My issues were the following:*Our group size was just too big to even try to stay together on the streets or sit together in the dining places / blue stools.*We ended our tour after only five places and just at 715pm...so we did not get three hours and we did not get the 6-8 places that all the other reviewers claim they had*Lucky gave us some cursory info on what we were eating but very little. *Lucky did not seem to want to interact with us at all. He stood away on his phone or just stood somewhere away from us while we were eating*Lucky did not even tell us anything about street food. We had hoped to learn what to look for and how to determine places you should try. We went on this tour to learn about street food but instead we just were led around to eat. We do not need a guide to do that for us and we certainly do not need to spend $20/pp for someone to lead us around.I know we had a difficult group but as a tour guide you have to at least try and make the experience pleasant for everyone.With all the great reviews, we expected so much more and we hoped to learn something about street food and Hanoi. However, we learned very little and it felt like it was a chore for Lucky to be taking us around. Perhaps this was just an off night but we still felt that we had to write an honest review. *If you are at all an adventurous person, you could create your own street food tour on your own for free! We did for the first week we were here.* Concentrate on the old quarter and L\u00fd Qu\u1ed1c S\u01b0 Street* Go to Pho 10 and where the crowds are."

What a brilliant way to spend a Saturday evening - I highly recommend you do the tour.The old quarter was buzzing with activity and to be led around and have the opportunity to sit amongst locals and eat with them was amazing. There were about 7 or 8 different foods sampled, each at a different location, with each food fully explained (in terms of its ingredients and how you combine/eat the food). (NB: I'm a picky eater and tried & loved everything!)It was so relaxing to have the pressure off as to choosing where and what to eat. We just wandered and chatted (as we followed/walked with) our guide and enjoyed the atmosphere of what feels like street theatre - i.e. just watching the locals going about their day to day business.Our guide ( Phuoc) who is just 23 & works 7 days per week, was great. He explained everything about the food; gave us explanations about key historical facts; and also answered every possibly question we could think of about Vietnamese culture and his own personal routine & circumstances. I.e. he hopes to marry his girlfriend next year.Do go on this tour and after you've enjoyed it as much as we did, dont forget to tip generously. After all there is a wedding that needs to be saved for :)"

We did a lunchtime tour our first day in Hanoi (and Vietnam) which was a wonderful way to get introduced to the crazy Old Town and the local food. We tried SO much food (come hungry!), including noodles, a soft rice/egg pancake, a tofu drink, sugarcane juice, spring rolls, fried 'pillow cakes' (which were a personal favorite), egg coffee, and fresh beer - bia hoi - which was delicious. All consumed on smaller-than-life, teeny tiny stools! Quite a workout for my 6 ft husband. This is the real deal experience, very local places that each serve pretty much just 1 thing. The food and drinks were delicious and we felt it was definitely worth the $15 cost. It would have been hard (especially on day 1) to track down all these places on our own. One highlight was that Ms. Moon is from the local area so she had actually grown up going to some of the vendors (eg, the noodle shop for special occasions with her family, or the tofu drink stand on schoolday afternoons)."

The three hour tour was too long for us, so they offered a two hour tour followed by an hour on cyclos back to our hotel. The three hour has 12 stops but we had 6. Unfortunately we were given a guide who hadn't read the website about the stroll and wander through the streets of Hanoi. He put on a cracking pace with the rest of us struggling to keep up with him in the crazy Hanoi traffic. At that pace you are just looking at where you are putting you foot down and who is about to run over you. Not much opportunity to look around.The guide spent much time on his mobile phone and occasionally gathered us together to tick the box of pointing out a local feature before taking off down the street with us struggling to keep up. Repeated requests from us to slow down had little effect.The street food was actually in little indoor eateries - off the street. None of the advertised outdoor barbeque stalls. Everything was very rushed as our guide waited for us to finish each course. The food was good and there was plenty of it. We were served up more than we could comfortably consume. The advertised egg coffee was one attraction we were keen to try but we wouldn't have had that if we didn't insist and he took us back to our first stop for that. On the website the coffee was to be served at a secret cafe where we would take in a spectacular night view of Hoan Kiem lake. We could see the four walls around us and that was about it which was probably the result of not taking the three hour tour.The cyclos were very comfortable and relaxing but the ride only lasted about 45 to 50 minutes which was enough because we were exhausted and were keen to get back to our hotel. Cyclos normally cost around $5 for an hour's ride. This part was actually Grandma's highlight because she could actually relax and take in the scenery without worrying where she was stepping.The tour price was too high, although the food was good, the experience was not enjoyable and we regret our decision to go on it."

Our favourite was the egg coffee, imagine a meringue on top on coffee - it was so good!! Most of the places we went to were down alleyways that you'd never find or didn't have English signs so you'd have no idea what it sells so it was good to have a guide take us to the places renowned locally.

Once you have settled into the crazy traffic and speed of life in Vietnam, then wandering around amongst the motorbikes and tooting cars all night will not be quite so daunting. The tour only takes about 10, so I suggest you email the company ahead of time to make sure you fit on. We started at 5pm had a friendly helpful guide called Ngam, (which means Money in English). Like others on TA, we found her great fun and she encouraged our group of 10 to try around15 to 20 different taste experiences from the street vendors. These little humble cafes were all places we would never have dreamed of sitting had we not been with her ( we often squatted down on little stools the street amongst the locals) Ngam explained lots about the foods we ate,Vietnamese customs and history as we walked around for 3 hours or so. We also met fun like-minded people on the tour.If you have an adventurous spirit and like seeing how the locals live and eat, then this tour is for you!

My friend and I did a day tour with Mr Them, who was a great english speaking guide and he was able to explain to us traditions and what we were eating! It was absolutely incredible walking through the markets, sampling traditional snacks and fruits. The tour started at one of the largest covered markets in the city. It was a really popular place and had such a lively feel to it! Loved it. On top of general information about what we were snacking on, Mr Them was able to offer historical facts about the market and the city, which were really interesting to hear! All of the locals and sellers were very friendly, too. One of my favorite parts had to be when we walked through the Old Quarter and were able to see how a popular dish is made, and then went on to see the residential local life. It was really neat being able to see how the locals lived! We visited many different food stalls, all of which were very good. Mr Them was very informative and he was able to answer any questions we had on the food, location, locals, etc. I think a big part of why the tour was so enjoyable is because we had such a great guide! The views we saw on this tour were spectacular and at the end of the tour, Mr Them was very helpful with directions back to our hotel and help locating taxis. Overall, we had a great experience and I would say this tour is not to be missed if you are planning a trip here! Definitely one of the top cherished memories of this trip.

Beside Pho, I reaaly enjoy Bun Cha.Vietnamese cuisine has many different dishes to sample and some of these dishes originated in Hanoi. When you travel to Vietnam and visit Hanoi, you can enjoy traditional food in restaurants or road side stalls. Hanoi and its environment are the birthplace of many quintessential Vietnamese dishes, such as Pho and Bun cha. No less than Pho, bun cha is a typical dish which is preferred by both many tourists and the local people, from the usual days to holidays in Vietnam.How to make bun cha is simple, but to do a delicious bowl of bun cha - it depends heavily on the experience and traditional know-how, especially mixing sauces. Perhaps, thanks to such amazing sauce, it has made the essence of bun cha dish in Hanoi that is difficult for some where can get. Bun Cha is a combination of several ingredients: lemongrass grilled pork meatballs, lemongrass grilled pork, rice vermicelli and sometimes eggroll. The meat should be fresh and contain both lean and fat portions so that the grilled meat is not too dry. Meat must be soaked carefully and grilled on the charcoal until getting the special aroma.The soul of a Bun Cha dish is the sauce. A bowl of a good sauce includes chili, vinegar, salty and sugar tastes. When you enjoy the dish, you should add a little lemonade and some slices of papaya or carrot to the bowl of sauce. To make a good bowl of sauce requires skillful hands of the chief. Vietnam is one of the countries having a unique and multi traditional of cuisine. The unique is combined from traditional best Vietnamese food with cooking secrets, processing technologies. It brings not only delicious food, but also good for health. And Bun Cha Ha Noi is one of the most delicious foods which make many tourists to choose Hanoi as the next destination for their tours in Vietnam."

From her I saw energy, passion, devotion of a young person to her job. I really appreciated the opportunity to get to know her and Vietnam! I gave her a five plus for the job she has done!The tour itself was good too. I would never be able to find and try these food within a few hours. So it was well worth it in my opinion!"

We ate so much that towards the end we requested half portions! She was also very open to requests, if there was something we were curious to try she was happy to get us a taste. My only complaint is that we did a lot of walking and exploring in the beginning and compressed many food stops together towards the end, would be better to spread them out so we have a chance to get hungry for more!"

I highly recommend it!Miss Ngan was the ideal guide as she made us sample a wide variety of food, each more delicious than the other. She adapted to our tastes and requests. And on top of everything, she also gave us lots of info and fun facts about the city itself...thus I would say this was a lot more than a food tour.Thank you miss Ngan for being so professional but also so much fun to spend the evening with!"

We tried to book on the day we arrived but they were unavailable, so we booked for the second day (moral of the story book: ahead of time if you can).We met them at their shop in the Old Quarter and were greeted by our lovely tour guide (I believe her name was Ngan). She had so much local knowledge and took us to so many little hole in the wall shops that most westerners would just walk by and not notice.The food was absolutely amazing and she even introduced us to some local streetside treats. You could tell that she genuinely felt like the places she were taking us to were among the best in Hanoi, and my partner and I both agreed. I can't say enough good things about our tour guide. She even stood up for us when one of the girls in our group was harassed by a local on the streets. Ngan got fiesty and put him in his place.The night finished with a couple beers outside at a local bar and everyone left very satisfied and full! This tour was $15 well spent!"

This street food tour completely made our trip to Hanoi. 3 hours of non stop eating and walking whilst taking in some culture and history of the city. Our first night we just wandered around trying different things but this tour totally made our visit there. We had a gorgeous little Vietnamese guide who spoke very good English and guided us through the craziness of the city, constantly stopping at little eateries and street food stands and shops. Places you wouldn't even know were there or think to go into, little stalls on the street, caf\u00e9s, beer hoi, food stands - everything. This is an authentic tour, non stop eating, hanging with the locals, everything paid for (including all the little bits and pieces she purchased along the way for us to try), all for $15pp. I've done some tours in Asia where the operator is clearly getting kickbacks from the establishments they take you to (think Thailand tuk tuks and gem stores), this is nothing like that. You ask about a food or something you see, she would just buy it for the group to taste and if she walked by something she thought we should try, we would go in.Awesome tour, so happy we came across it and booked it."

Ms Ngan took us to more 5 places, helped us sample all ingredients that make up each dish, explained the history or the trivia behind the dishes and took very good care of us. She even shared small bits of history of the place with us. She helped us experience the city, up-close-and personal. I also enjoyed her good humor and friendly approach. From icecream to donuts to noodles to porridge to spring rolls, every single stop was delicious. With a $15 USD rate, this tour is highly recommended. Do an evening tour. It starts from 5 PM and goes on till 8.30 PM. Thank you guys at Hanoi Street Food tour for such an amazing time :)!"

The company rep replied to my email requests diligently and set up a time for today. However that's where the customer service ended. Waited in our hotel lobby for 20 min waiting for the tour rep to show up this morning. No one appeared. Mailed the company. Called the number on the website and no answer. Got our concierge to call, still no answer. Didn't get an answer to our mail yet. Our entire first half of the day was ruined due to this. Precious time on a short holiday. We finally made it to the Old Quarter on our own and walked around and sampled some of the treats in our own but that was an incomplete trip given our lack of knowledge. I am still awaiting an explanation from the tour company."

We walked round the narrow streets of the old city, admiring the unspoiled architecture, and stopping every 20 minutes for another taste sensation. It's a great way to give tourists confidence in street food!Tastes include soup with noodles, ginger and chicken; crispy pork rolls; egg-coffee (to die for!), and vegetarian options are available. It's a tour as well as a food exploration. Miss Hang was a wonderful guide, full of laughs and stories, and she lives locally in Hang Bac Street.You watch the food being made or assembled before your eyes, with the almost transparent rice pancake filled with egg the highlight. We took the 6 am option, when the streets were fresh and mercifully free of motorbikes, but other times are available.$US50 for 2 people, coming down to $15 each for groups of 6.Warning to the knee-challenged: street food does involve sitting on low plastic stools which are very close to the ground!"

Phouc catered to our requests and found unique foods at places we would've never discovered on our own. If you can handle the lack of sanitation of street food, then I highly suggest taking this tour. So far, it was the best $30 my husband and I spent- well worth the money and time!"

We live in Bali, Indonesia, travel to Asian cities often, and always sample the street food. We found Hanoi to be one of the best street food cities and after a couple of days of trying dishes on our own we felt we needed some direction. So we booked with this tour company and were lucky to have Miss Ngan as our guide on a cold, damp night. She had us sample some wonderful tasty dishes and we left with a comfortable knowledge of the street scene. I heartily recommend this tour to any and all who visit Hanoi."

In the midst of the heat and bustling roads, the wonders of Vietnamese culinary lie in between. From thirst quenching drinks to mouth-watering foods, this is the place to be. The choices of the food and drinks served are significantly abundant and mostly unique to foreigners giving their taste buds a satisfying adventure. The vendors sell their food and drinks at very moderate prices to attract more customers. It has been a very astounding experience to have tried many exciting dishes from this retreat. Truly a great experience and hope to visit again next time."

My family and I did a day tour with Mr Them, who was a great english speaking guide and he was able to explain to us traditions and what we were eating! It was absolutely incredible walking through the markets, sampling traditional snacks and fruits. The tour started at one of the largest covered markets in the city. It was a really popular place and had such a lively feel to it! Loved it. On top of general information about what we were snacking on, Mr Them was able to offer historical facts about the market and the city, which were really interesting to hear! All of the locals and sellers were very friendly, too. One of my favorite parts had to be when we walked through the Old Quarter and were able to see how a popular dish is made, and then went on to see the residential local life. It was really neat being able to see how the locals lived! We visited many different food stalls, all of which were very good. Mr Them was very informative and he was able to answer any questions we had on the food, location, locals, etc. I think a big part of why the tour was so enjoyable is because we had such a great guide! The views we saw on this tour were spectacular and at the end of the tour, Mr Them was very helpful with directions back to our hotel and help locating taxis. Overall, we had a great experience and I would say this tour is not to be missed if you are planning a trip here! Definitely one of the top cherished memories of this trip. Hope to go again at some point with friends :)"

If you're looking for a way to experience the real Hanoi and not just the usual tourist spots then definitely make some time in your schedule to do this. We met up with our tour guide Miss Hang at 5pm. From there started at Dong Xuam, which we were told was the city's biggest covered market. The place was amazing, buzzing with sellers promoting their produce. The smells certainly made me hungry. It was so hard to decide what to try! Our guide spoke great English and had expert knowledge about all of the different local foods on offer. She also gave us interesting historical information about the market and food, something we never would have learned without a local guide. My favourite was a fruit dessert that is a local tradition. When we wandering through the Old Quarter we got to see a mixture of street stalls and homes. It was a great way to experience a little of how the local people live. We finished the tour at a little gem of a caf\u00e9 with amazing views of Hoan Kiern Lake. Here we got to try a now hard to find local speciality of egg coffee while we got to sit and take in the atmosphere. We thoroughly enjoyed our tour. Everyone was so friendly and happy to tell us about their food and willing to share some great stories. I'm glad we took the evening tour, the lights and views were made even more amazing after the sun set."
