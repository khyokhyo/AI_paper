I greatly appreciated how people took care of their cats (and dogs). Also suits for Lovers of Sun and Sea! It is a pity that many tourists have avoided Turkey, I would encourage you to visit and enjoy life of Istanbul despite of all incertainty made by news. There will be so much more to experience!"

Friendly people. Plenty to see and do. Get an Istanbulcard which operates as a pre-pay ticket for metro, trams, buses and ferries. Explore the upper reaches of the Bosporus, beyond Besiktas and Ortakoy, and eat on the waterside on the Asia side. A great city for walking but very hilly and many historic areas cobbled.

Mosques and museums are so beautiful and well-kept. (Just be aware that some knucklehead tour guides will have their \"laser light\" pointing at ceilings & such, when you're trying to take photos and get a green streak in your shots). The food is amazing, from their typical cuisine, to the wonderful Turkish Delight (which is addicting!). It's really easy to get around the city on their little tram, or a taxi. (Make sure the taxi driver uses a meter so you don't get stiffed). There have been some horrific things going on in Istanbul recently, and I hope we have the chance to return again."

The historic area which basically is Sultanahmet district is a compact area containing the major attractions Istanbul is famous for. Historical monuments spanning milleniums like the Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the little Hagia Sophia, so on and so forth are located in this area. Book a room at one of the many hotels in this area and you dont need to leave this district. My stay of 4 nights wasn't enough to cover all of the attractions here to be honest. And I estimate I would need another 4 nights for Galata area which is a mix of history and fun."

Topkapi palace a must, especially the pavillions and princes circumcision room (best tiles in the entire palace in my opinion) and do visit the kitchen and watch and armoury displays. We were fortunate that there were small crowds due to the fear factor. Must visit the Harram, although I prefer the lighter palaces of Europe."

Unfortunately, as I was leaving one of my bags was lost. About 6 months later I received a phone call from Ozden Basak in San Francisco who was there doing lectures across America on Persian/Oriental rugs. He was in possession of my lost luggage and offered to bring it to me in Chicago on his way back to Istanbul. Needless I was thrilled when he stopped by my home to deliver my bag. We had just had our floors re-finished and I told Ozden I was in the market for a rug. Next think I knew, he ask his men to bring about 15 rugs up to my apt. and I wound up buying two gorgeous rugs! When he was leaving, Ozden told me that in addition to dealing in rugs, if I ever came back to Turkey to look him up because he owned Turkland Travel Agency in Istanbul and he would love to show off his city. Seven years later I was planning once again to visit this magical city and found his business card. I wrote him and he immediately responded. Over the course of about 4 or 5 weeks we conversed back and forth and Ozden planned an amazing itinerary for me while there. We were met at the airport and were transported via a Mercedes to our hotel room. The next day Ozden assigned the best guide in Turkey, Mr. Istanbul himself, Metin Yilmaz to show us around from 9:00 a.m. til 5:00 p.m. for the next two days. Everything was taken care of with precision detail.....the guide, the transportation, and the meals. Ozden even took time out of his busy day to joiin us for lunch one day. He could not have been more attentive, knowledgeable, and kind. Ozden even remarked that he no longer considered us clients but friends....and it certainly showed. If ever you have the opportunity to visit Turkey, I hope you will contact Ozden Basak at Turkland Travel. You will not be disappointed. I think he's the best travel agent in all of Turkey. Highly recommended!!!"

The sights are amazing and, if one is a student of history, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire come alive. The other thing is the voices and smells. Obviously, this isn't western Europe; but, it's still fun to walk around where you hear very little English, French, German, etc. but you do hear a lot of Turkish, Slavic languages including Russian, and Arabic. It's also enlightening to see the contrast between most Turks (who are 95% Muslim) and the Arab visitors. While Turkish men and women dress the same as in Rome or Barcelona, the Arab men feel no compunctions about wearing casual pants and light shirts while the women with them are dressed head-to-toe in black, drapey clothes and only thing visible on the women from Saudi (I asked) is their eyes."

The city and its mix of modern life and ancient history was both enchanting and captivating. The food was absolutely delicious. The people were oh so friendly and greeted you with a smile wherever you went. It's best to stick within a group and not to head off on your own. Transportation was easy. We loved using the very efficient train. Be sure to first confirm costs of taxis before getting in. Of course with being a tourist, tips are always welcomed.We had the privilege of being lead by a very knowledgeable and professional tour guide. He took the time to interact with everyone in our group and made us feel welcome. He was always available to answer any questions. When we felt like venturing out on our own he provided us with great recommendations.What made him stand out from other tour guides is the fact that he spent all his time with our group. He had all meals with us and spent any free time telling us about life in Istanbul. We were fascinated and captivated by his stories.The tour was hassle-free and we were on time for all our planned trips. Just make sure that you are on time too.If you're looking for a great English speaking tour guide with a great sense of humor, please contact Murat Ozkan at Murattouristguide@gmail.com.Enjoy your trip!"

The store owners are extremely congenial and non-threatening - but your time could be better spent amongst the antiquities. From day 2 on, sadly, we were forced to be somewhat rude and simply ignore anyone who spoke to us in English so that we could get to our museum destinations."

The most historic treasurers are to be found in the area named after one of the Ottoman Sultans called Ahmed. Ahmet as a Sultan doesn't appear to be a significant ruler but where he lived has a great deal of historical values, thus brings in many thousands of tourists into Istanbul. You could find a restaurant with see thru floors under which historical Roman artifacts can be viewed while you are enjoying a Turkish Kabab Dinner !!! A fascinating experience. A must place to visit is Aya Sofia Museum right across from the 4 Seasons Hotel. Get there early in the morning 'cause there are long lines of tourists just like you. If you are a big spender get reservations at the 4 Seasons for about a $1K a night. Otherwise, try Biz Cevahir Hotel a few blocks down at about $300./night. However, we discovered that \"The Berks Hotel/Guest House\", right next to the 4 Seasons, is the most desirable location for their most friendly service and a very reasonable financial cost(under $200.) which includes breakfast with smiles. Some times you even get a free glass of red wine from Ahmet, spouse of owner/manager Yesim. Hope you enjoy your next trip to Istanbul. May the Force be with you !! U. B.

Many low cost cruise tours will take you through the Bosporus, Golden Horn and Sea of Marmara all the way to the Black Sea. There are drop off tours of beautiful mansions and view points like Pierre Loti Hill. Wander through the bazaar - it will take you a while - and listen to the competitive nature of the barkers. Try a local hole in the wall for lunch and watch your choice grilled in front of you. The chef will come sit as you enjoy his creation. Stay in the historic area of town to get the feel of the city."

If you are in a hotel in the Sultanahmet area there is no need for a guided tour for the Blue Mosque, Sophia Haggia, Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar and Spice Market. It is pretty safe as of May 2016. You need the same street smarts as in any large city. However you can pick up a guide at the entrance and negotiate a fee. They should have an visible id on them. The only catch would be to determine that the id is genuine. If you must choose, go to the first three which are very close to one another, less than 10 minites. Grand Bazaar is about a 15 minute walk from Topkapi Palace on a pretty safe street or you can take a tram for 4 TL one stop from Sultanahmet. The Spice Market would be two stops on the Tram from the Sultanahmet stop or about at 20 minute walk. After the Spice Market take a boat across from the tram stop for a Bosphorus cruise 12TL. On a rainy day it can be done though not ideal as most of it is indoors."

There are historic sights at every corner and in every square. There are numerous Roman era sights but of course given the Byzantine beginnings of this city there are tell tale signs of the origin of this city including the famous Blue Mosque. Wandering around the Spice market, the Grand Bazaar as well as just the narrow streets of the city. The Topkapi palace is a sight to behold but be careful as in any tourist orientated city there can be many a scam. The mighty Bosphorous divides the city into the \"historic\" Asian part and the \"more modern\" European part but the city still retains its historic heart."

Visit Top Kapi Place, Grand Bazar, Blue Mosque with six minarets,Sultan Ahmet, Lallelli ( where you can find hotels ans interesting shops...)Galata Tower is a good place from which you can contemplate the city from the top, it's on Istiklal Avenue, near Taksim square( 30 minutes on foot).There are so many places worth visiting in Istanbul, it's my favourite destination!"

The airport is disorganised especially the rude security staff. That way it shows itself as more middle-east than European as people in general are impolite and usually their spoken English is poor. From the airport if your hotel organises it there is a supershuttle service which is great and costs 5 Euros. Otherwise a taxi would cost 15-20 Euros. Public transport is good and they have Tramways and trains running to midnight. You could buy a travelcard for 10 liras and the card price is 6 liras and you can top it up at any station (4 liras=\u00a31) better exchange rates in the market than in banks. Food is a bit bland so I missed my hot food!. I visited without a tour guide and the information here is simply great. I visited the Blue or Sultanmehmet Mosque, its amazingly beautiful; Hagia Sophia which was a Byzantine church built by Constantine then underwent damage, was rebuilt and the converted to a mosque defacing the Christian paintings everywhere to fit in with Islam! Right in the city are two obelisks one belonging to a Pharoah; nearby is the German Fountain given by the Kaiser, The Topkapi Palace is great but if you little time then the most important aspects are the antiquities room housing the bowl used by Abraham, the stick used by Moses, the clothes and flag of the Prophet.....no doubt the queues here are slow moving. The other area is the Harem. Hagia Sophia is getting renovated so! One can take a cruise and I chpose Seth Hatlari for 12 liras that I felt was enough.There is an archaelogical museum, a tile museum. The Bazaar is great and I went to the Spice Bazaar ....the roads parallel to the spice bazaar have a lot of deals and prices better. A museum card for 85 liras is worth it."

The first is that shop and restaurant owners can be quite pushy and may try to force you into their establishment before you have even had the chance to look at the menu. I would research restaurants before going out and do not stop anywhere else or make eye contact with the restaurant employees outside. The second is not to trust any local who approaches you to help you outside of any major attraction. We had someone help us outside the Blue Mosque, and we ignorantly accepted his help. He was waiting for us when we exited the mosque, and ushered us into his rug store and tried to pressure us into buying. We were able to get away after a few minutes, but it was still and uncomfortable expereince."

The fish meals in these restaurants is very good and tasty. The hold city is a place not to miss. However, be careful with the taxi drivers who can con you out of a lot of money."

There is a very good tram network within the city, so if you feel tired you can hop on to a tram. Istanbul is a very lively city, very vibrant with lots of tourists around. The public transport system is very good as well. The city is full of rich history & heritage which is very well preserved. Istanbul to me has a blend of San Francisco, Paris & Jaipur.

Dont get caught by the shoe shine guys dropping a brush, accidently on purpose ! Dont pick it up ! My son got ripped off for 32 lira, they wanted 70 lira, ( he was exploring on his own with GF), but 32 was all he had on him! Food is boring and pricey, not typical turkish food. Use the little run down places selling food, its cheap and good, ( these are typical across Turkey) but if prices arent written up somewhere, ask the price BEFORE you order ! Theres a little portacabin in the main square, does good snacks and drinks at normal Turkish prices.use it , its there for all tourists not just the Turks ! Big bus tour if you want to use it for 2 days haggle over the price, it a great way to see some of the more obscure things in Istanbul. Grand bazzar, well its a tourist trap, but its worth a visit, buy outside of the bazzar, you'll normally get a much better price. Blue Mosque, its a mosque, much better things to see in Istanbul. Get a MUZE CART, it'll save you money. Stay central hotel, easy to find the main points of interest as they are all in the same area. Fab city ! Easy to get around."

From my experience I can say that walking from place to place is a wonderful way to experience Istanbul, even (and especially) the Historic areas. So many wonders lie behind the great Mosques and Bazaars. Getting \"lost\" in the tiny, hilly streets around the Egyptian Market, the Grand Bazaar, and in Sultanahmet adds a different perspective to the historical buildings. If you start early, you'll be walking the streets with the vendors, market workers and (probably) polis. Of course, just walking around without a tour guide gives you more time to take pictures, interact with locals, and quietly observe. I was fortunate enough to have alone time in many Mosques, be the first tourist in Hagia Sophia in the morning, and have candid conversation with Grand Bazaar vendors before the crowds arrive. I started my days at a leisurely 7:30am, using Istanbul\u2019s fantastic public transit to take me to a starting point. You can read all the other reviews for what to look at and why to visit, of course. How you experience Istanbul will color your impression of it. If you are guided everywhere, or only go out and about in the crowded afternoons and early evenings, you might find the Historic Area to be more like a European Mall than a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But with a little patience (and a lot of walking up and down steep hills) you can find awe. I did!"

This area is brimming with mosques, palaces, museums, monuments, bazaars, hamams, cobbled streets and kebab shops. No wonder it is called the World Capital as this is the center from where two great civilizations were ruled."

Starting with Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet Mosque), Basilica Cistern, Aya Sofya, then Topkapi Palace, all within the same area. Basically you can cover those places in a day (one whole day from 8 am to 6pm for instance). But if you're so much in love with history, one day is certainly not enough (for me, Topkapi took half of my day to visit ; it's huge!) The famous Grand Bazaar, Spice bazaar, Eminonu & Suleymaniye Mosque are also in the Fatih area but it's on the other side (walking about 20 minutes). With this, I would recommend you to stay around Sultanahmet area so it will be easier for you to move around without the need to take public transport (saves some pennies). Don't worry about food, restaurants are just plenty & easily available all the time."

Lots of beautiful, old architecture, not only this world renown. All historical places marked with obelisque-shape, lit in the dark posts with relevant description in few languages including English. It is very easy to get around, the best on foot as most attractions are walking distance from one another within a district. Between districts is good to take metro, tram or funicular. Lots of nice restaurants, I specially liked the ones with the buffet at the window, where one can choose whatever appeals the most. The meal is usually followed by free baclava! Loved shopping but as much as I recommend spending time in the Grand Bazaar which is beautiful and must be seen, I decided to spend my money elsewhere as the prices were much more acceptable. I recommend to make a trip by a cable car over the cemetery to the lovely historical cafe on the top of the hill- the views are amazing! Bosphorus trip is a must and area around Galata Tower is great for views, shopping- lots of small boutiques with very unusual clothes and accessories. Allow at least 3 hours for Topkapi Seray- we underestimated its size! Archeological Museum is amazing and needs at least 2 hours. Don't miss Basilica Cistern- very special experience! Don't hesitate to buy Museum Pass- it is really worth it, only 85 tl for 5 days allows free, skip the line entry to most attractions!"

We arrived in Istanbul on a Sunday afternoon.Having looked at the map to find out the best way to get to our hotel, we plumped for the M1 train, changing at Zeytinburnu, transferring to the T1 tram to the stop nearest our hotel which was Beyazit.The plan was to buy a Istanbulkart at the train terminal\u2026first mistake, they were not available there?We were standing at the top-up machine when this very nice young woman asked if she could help. We explained our problem and she then found out from the guard that they were not available, she then topped up her own card and proceeded to swipe us through the barriers, we offered to repay her, but she was having none of it, what a lovely gesture and much appreciated.At the cross over station, still no cards available, so we purchased a couple of tokens.When we tried to put them in the barrier, one of them didn't work!This time a nice young man stopped to help us and spoke to the guard to get us on the tram.The train & tram were packed and just when you thought the were bursting, more people get on at each of the following stations. You really do have to fight your way off when it is your stop. No one waits for you to get off before they try to get on\u2026be prepared to push On another day, we were at Kabatas and boarded the T1 at the beginning, therefore getting a seat. Next to us were an Indian family. As the train went on, it got fuller and fuller. At one point, the Indian family (husband, wife, son & daughter) were all taken off their seats to make way for \u201clocals\u201d and not just elderly women!!! We were horrified!! One of the seats was taken by a middle aged local. At a further stop, a middle aged woman got on, ignored him, but expected me to give up my seat\u2026against my natural instinct, I remained seated\u2026he didn't move either!! What we found when travelling on a train/tram\u2026if you are a foreigner, it is safer if you just stand from the start as the locals can be quite forceful, ignorant & rude if you are seated.We like to walk around on our city breaks, do a bit of window shopping and then doubling back when we decide what to buy.The shopping experience in Istanbul was an eye-opener!!It is impossible to stop and look in a window without someone trying to usher you inside. At first it was amusing but after a very short time it became waring and actually put us off even looking in a window\u2026so much so, that we ended up buying next to nothing By the end of the holiday, we weren't even taking on the people trying to get us in their shop. What I did find was that they bothered you less if you wear sunglasses, I guess because they can't see your eyes?Having recently been to Budapest, where the people/transport/shopping/general feel of the place was EXCELLENT, Istanbul has been a bit of a wake up call and not for the faint hearted.My tip would be to buy an Istanbulkart when you can and take some of the ferries to the different ports, have a quick walk around (wearing sunglasses) and back on the ferry.Plan your sightseeing and stick to it, avoid the guys walking about who try and hustle you back to their families shop\u2026after a few encounters, I just said to the guy I don't want what he is selling\u2026he said \u201cbut you don't know what my family shop sells\u201d\u2026I said I don't care, I don't want it\u2026\u201dbut we sell Viagra\u201d was his reply\u2026I shook his hand as that was a cracker There are some amazing sights, but make a plan and stick to it.If you do want to buy something, have an idea of the price you want to pay as nothing is priced.For me, this holiday was long enough in Istanbul, we arrived Sunday afternoon and left Wednesday morning!!!

The Spice Market was closed due to a holiday. We saw a number of Mosques, the railway station where the Orient Express used to stop, the Old Wall on Kennedy Road (named after John F Kennedy after his assasination). From 395 - 453, this city was capital of the Byzantine Empire. It was a most interesting trip and particularly good if you only have a short time in this fascinating city. Later in the week, we did a further two bus trips, but independently, with taped information through headphones. We caught these two buses from Sultanahmet Square and both these trips were excellent too. One is the blue bus and the other the red bus. Cheaper if you buy the two at the one time, the evening before you want to use them."

The tour would stay at a different 5 star hotel each night. travelling ever westwards and southwards towards Gallipoli, then crossing the dardanelles strait to cannakale for the visit to Troy. Then down south to Ephesus ; Hierapolis/pammukale travertines and south over the snowcapped taurus mountains to antalya.Our guide Miss Renan Saylag (Reni) was extremely knowledgeable of the sites on the tour and she had an encyclopaedic knowledge of Turkey in general.Our driver Ahmed was good. Both were with us throughout the week and the customer service from them was first class.The coach was comprised of 25 passengers ; over 60s ; a couple who required assistance.. Brill guide and driver- cant praise them enough.The Istanbul Hotel ; I only got to see after midnight and in the early hours but that was because turkish airlines had cancelled my early flight but this was not the fault of -- a secret turkey/Hays--Indeed this meant that our guide and driver were also put out and could not get to their beds before 0100 am either.My first bad impression was changed when we visited the sultanahmet square, the blue mosque..beautiful. the historic hagia sofia...magnificent and the beautiful topkapi palace..a boat trip aalong the bosphorus towards the black sea ended the day, then off to our hotel incorlu, tekirdag. an excellent 5 star hotel with good food and acceptable wifi. Room standards in all the hotels were excellent but the hotels further south had poor wi-fi and food was not good.Lunch on the road however was really good every day.We visited the thought provoking battlefield of Gallipoli and then crossed the Dardanelles straits to Troy. There were some sceptics in the group but their input on Troy was well out of date.There isnt a lot there but I appreciated every aspect.I was disappointed.in that the wooden horse donated by the film company for the Brad Pitt movie was not to be seen as I expected from the company's pictures.Instead the unrealistic horse /shed was there on its own.As it was winter , Ephesus, that I had visited before was less crowded. So I got many photos and saw things I did not see on my first visit.Forgot to mention..winter in Istanbul.five layers of clothing , hat , gloves . scarves required... - 9 degrees c , extremely cold. so dont be fooled by previous summer visits.North of the south coastal taurus mountains, you might as well be in scandinavia, weatherwise.My third visit to Hierapolis and Pammukale. Still a worthwhile visit. I missed out the theatre that I'd previously seen; unlike my travelling companions who did not see it as well. it is up a steep hill ,having said that; and on very rough ground.The travertines of Pammukale on the slopes below the town are still a wonder.There followed the compulsory ; turkish government dictated tours to ljewellery leather and carpet shops and wine tasting.We then continued south through the taurus mountains to touristic Antalya for our last afternoon. All in all , a worth while and excellent value trip. A good guide can make all the difference. I once travelled to Israel on a russian tour bus and understood nothing. so I know.Thanks again Reni."

We started off with a visit at the basilikum cicterns which was an marvelous experience. Next door you have the blue mosk and hagia Sofia. Behind Hagia Sofia you'll find the Topcapi palace with a lot of landmarks. We also had dome time left at our stop over to vidit the grand Basar ( if you like shopping snd barging). A great stop over snd all in 8 hours."

You can use tram T1 to get there or metro ( Aksaray station, but you will need to walk a little bit). Also you can buy special card for visiting museums. Such card will costs 85 tl and it gives you a possibility to enter different museums (except Galata tower and Basilica cistern) for free during 72 hours. It is very profitably."

            "review": "\"...Romantic City...\". Hi there,Istanbul is a city the straddles 2 continents. It is here that the charms of the Europes meet the mysteries of the Asias. If you listen carefully, you may actually hear the cries of the Roman Soldiers manning the City Walls against the constant attacks of the Ottomans. If you lucky enough, you may even \u201csee Caesar travel with his procession back to Rome on the King\u2019s Road.\u201dHaving returned from a 5 night trip to Istanbul, i present my account below.- We initially booked hotel transfers from airport. It was R 2,200.- I researched the net and found the tram a convenient way to travel from the Ataturk Intl Airport to the hotel (hotel reviewed) in Aksaray.- This cost me R 140 return for 2 adults. We only bought 1 Istanbulkart.- The train station at the airport is very easy to find.- Maps are easy to follow and boards are well marked.- Further the people are extremely friendly and will assist if you ask for directions.- It helps to learn very basic Turkish as well.- We got off at the train station and walked for about a kilometre to our hotel.- I highly recommend using the metro as it is reasonably priced, convenient and very easy to follow.- In my time there, we visited the following:1. Landed and checked in (17:00) - Day 12. Blue Mosque - Day 23. Topkapi Palace - Day 24. Sofia Hagya - Day 25. Hippodrome - Day 2 (came back as there was a marathon and could not enjoy the beauty of the obelisks.6. Grand Bazaar - Day 37. Spice Bazaar - Day 38. Eminonu (enjoying the views and snacks - Day 39. Bhosphorous Cruise - Day 310. Dolmabache\u2019 Palace - Day 411. Galata Tower views - Day 412. Walked around Kadikoy and across Galata Bridge \u2013 Day 413. Theodosian Walls - Day 414. Basillica Cistern - Day 415. Turkish Hamman - Day 5(Went to Sofular Hamman, it cost TL 50 pp and we gave a tip as well. Truly authentic Turkish Bath experience. We don\u2019t speak Turkish (except basic) and the staff do-not speak English. This added to the surreal experience of the trip. I highly recommend this as opposed to the Baths in the tourist places. Wife ensured that we found the \u201ckesse\u201d in the local markets, used in the bath to take back home)16. Grand Bazaar \u2013 last minute shopping17. Hippodrome - Day 5Prices of a Doner Kepab in Sultanahmet is +- TL 10. In Aksaray it was TL 3 for the same meal Same logic applicable to Turkish Delight.One would appreciate Istanbul more if they understand the History behind Constantinople, Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire. It took us about 3 hours in Topkapi Palace and 3 hours in Sofia Hagia each due to the rich history attached to each building. The Hippodrome took about an hour, purely because I generally try to go back in time and imagine what it felt like to have been one of 100,000 spectators watching the chariots race passed. It is almost nostalgic to be looking at an Obelisk that was most likely gifted by Cleopatra (Pharaoh of Egypt) to the Roman Empire. Some much history, so much time had passed\u2026..and yet I am only a metre away from it!Further, be adventurous. Try the simit, try the grilled figs, try the mealies, try the fish and bread etc. these are great wholesome and filling snacks at reasonable pricing. Istanbul is an excellent tourist destination.I planned this trip without use of a tour company or GPS to find my way. All I carried was a map book \u2013 sensing an adventure.In summary, special thanks to Enigma \u2013 my friend. Your information posted in assisting other travellers, assisted my wife and i as well. I felt almost as if you were with us on the trip!!!"

With all the latest incidents in Turkey lately it was portrayed that it would not be a safe choice at the moment. But we decided to go along with our original plan and include Istanbul as our first stop of our European tour. After my visiting this great city, I have nothing but warm feelings for this place and the people! To begin with we felt safe at all times and there was no trace of what we heard about on the news. Extraordinary architecture influenced by the east and the west! Extraordinary cultural heritage as seen through the monuments and sights. We were fascinated by the simple living of the people of Istanbul. We collected memorable images such as the men who were fishing from Galata Bridge. Another aspect of our visit was the quality of food which was top-notch. The area where we found the many places to eat was Beyoglu. We enjoyed kebabs at local restaurants like Zubeyir Ocakbasi, but the best part was the deserts. Also do not miss out on the fresh stuffed clams which you can buy from a street vendor. Istanbul is a beautiful and culturally rich city I would definitely recommend visiting again."

The city is so welcoming and hospitable to tourists. The only downside at some of the places was the locals not knowing English, which made it a little difficult to converse.Its one of those countries, which I would love to travel again with my spouse.

There were visits to jewellery, leather and carpet factories as well as the more cultural visits.The guide and bus driver were friendly, knowledgable and helpful. All in all I can say that it was, without doubt, he best deal I've ever had.A Secret Turkey also offers a 'sister' tour which takes in other sites, such as Cappadocia.So, if you want something more from Turkey than a beach holiday....this is the one!I must add that, as we stayed in a different hotel each night, he accommodation and the food was top notch. We ate lunch in a different traditional Turkish restaurant each day too. We didn't have to pay for anything except drinks! Unbelievable value."

Be mindful of rip-off taxi drivers - whatever you are quoted for a fare, offer a quarter and then you might have around the right figure! From Hafiz Mustafa Turkish Delight shop at the Taksim end of Istiklal to the incessant hawkers at the Grand Bazaar, Istanbul offers a great experience. Go to the side streets to find cafes and bars, and look for the almost invisible 'Pasaj's' on Istiklal to really get the flavour of the place. The traders in the passage arcades are a lot more friendly than in the Bazaar and you'll find exactly the same products without the hassle.

I would suggest that you start with the main part of the palace where you will have a palace guide to escort you from room to room. There are more than 300 rooms in this palace and the guide will show you around 20 of them. This is a very informative tour and you should pay attention to these very well informed guides as they bring the past to life. Very highly decorated in gold and crystal the palace is beautifully preserved.Your next stop will be a different guide in the harem, where all the wives were housed and indeed the kings mother. A very different story as far as the d\u00e9cor is far far more basis but the stories are quite intriguing.

You Will love this place, if you like to walk around easily not rushing yourself.I might take a full day walking,Don't worry there are many places were you can enjoy a cup of Turkish coffee,sweets,light snack,or even good meal.Most Masjids has next to them clean restrooms and they charge one lira to use it.The ancient and historical buildings will make you feel and live the old times of the ISLAMIC OTTOMAN EMPIRE .Even if you do not know the history,you will feel the glory of that time.There are many shops with offering huge variety of items an souvenirs.(( You must be a very good bargainer to get a good selling price)).I can write much more but I think this is enough Good luck."

Perhaps it's the thousands years of history to soak up or the beauty and grandeur of the architecture and design innovation - but there is something peaceful about the busy area. Must sees are the Underground Cistern, Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia. However, take some time to wander down the surrounding laneways and you'll find beautiful trinket stores, lovely homewares, Turkish fashions and most importantly delicious restaurants and cafes!"

And the people of Istanbul are the happiest and most gregarious I have encountered in the world. They are not just selling you stuff - they are interested in a conversation. Boy can they talk...buy a cup of Turkish coffee and enjoy! The spice markets are a right of passage. Ataturk's castle tells the story of a people. The history of Roman engineering is clear in the aqueducts and great cisterns. The mosques at dusk are more beautiful than can be conveyed by the English language.

Istanbul itself is very, very busy with long queues for most of the popular attractions and we unfortunately ran out of time to visit the underground cisterns. The tram is very easy to use and costs 4 Turkish Lira for one journey, irrespective how far you are travelling. If you make a mistake, as we did, you simply get off at the next stop and change to the correct tram as long as you do not leave through the turnstiles. The Grand Bazaar is massive but we managed to find our way out by following our noses and with help of a local trader close to where we wanted to be anyway."

On another trip we went to the Ayasofia Museum, the Blue Mosque and the Basilica Cistern. The Basilica Cistern was the only one where entry isn't covered by our Museumkart but at only 20TL entry, was a delightful addition to our day out.A drink and snack at a nearby bar then a walk back to the Grand Bazaar and back over to Beyoglu where we were staying.

Lol, so if you plan on shopping for the women in your life you'll get a great bargain on the handbags, pashminas and home decor. Of course, you can gorge on the turkish delights and Baklava. Make sure you get a Hamam (turkish bath). No matter what you do- shop or eat always and always bargain because they increase prices by 50-70% than the actual cost.We also did a cruise to Prince Island which is 1.5 hours away from Istanbul on the bosphorous river. Its an island where no cars are allowed so you can ride a cycle all around or even take a horse cart. Obviously make sure to visit the historical and architectural marvels of Istanbul. They are all concentrated around the same area so getting there shouldn't be an issue. Weather in Istanbul is unpredictable because 2 days before we visited it was pouring heavily. And the day we landed it was pleasant during the day and cold in the nights. DO NOT visit during the summer- you won't enjoy the sightseeing."

The main sites are all within walking distance to each other. We started at the bottom end of the Main Street and went to see the Roman cisterns first. This amazing underwater storage system is kept in good condition and tickets are 20EU per adult. The visit takes about an hour.We then walked further up the street to see the Hagia Sophia, one of the best examples of a Byzantine church. Fortunately the ticket line was not as long as when we came out. Tickets being 30EU per person. Walk up the ramp on the left hand side of the entrance to go to the second floor which has the most beautiful wall mosaics.While we waited for the Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmet Mosque) to open after the afternoon prayers we enjoyed a typical Turkish lunch at one of the small restaurants. Non Muslim visitors must enter from the separate entrance around the corner on the right hand side. There is no entry fee but if you are not appropriately dressed you can borrow coverings from near the entry door. We also needed to remove and carry our shoes. The building was a disappointment as the outside appeared dirty and drab. The inside beautiful ceiling was totally ruined by a vast array of wires hanging from the ceiling to support the many lights.A must to complete our day in Istanbul was buying some of the most delicious Turkish sweets from a nearby sweet shop to eat after our evening meal."

I approached our visit to Istanbull with an eliment of apprehension in view of the current uncertainties and difficulties in this part of the world. Those fears were soon overcome by the warmth of the local people and the delight of finding we could walk very safely and freely around the Historic areas. It is a place of magical sites and wonderful things to see, and they are all so close to each other and within easy walking distance. Take time to sit and enjoy a Turkish coffee. Initially I thought we had arrived during a carpet sellers convention!! But once you relax into this world of carpet sellers and let the humour flow it can be fun. I told a few at my time of life I was down sizing and had a house full of carpets they could have at a knock down price if they paid the shipping and tax!My advice is if you get the chance visit, it is a wonderful part of the world.If you have a sweet youth and love \"Turkish delights\" you will have arrived in your. heaven!"

This bazaar is really world famous, and I had heard a lot about it so I had to go just to see what is was all about It really is an interesting place for those who love shopping or just savoring the atmosphere of an old enclosed market place. I took the tram from my hotel to the correct stop with no problem. Just don't show an interest in any item, or the storekeeper will be all over you! I looked at a single scarf, and in an instant it was tied around my neck, and I was shown three others that I also might like! The good part was that I learned 3 different ways of wearing it in about 2 minutes. Don't accept the first price you hear. Start to walk away and the price will go down. Same if you want to buy more than one. Also, with so many places selling the same items, you can compare prices. I wanted some of those Turkish charms that you see everywhere with the blue stones for cheap souvenirs for friends. They are supposed to be for good luck. On a key chain, the prices varied between 3 and 4 TL apiece. Buying 10 of them, I got them from one vendor for 15 TL total, and I'm sure he still made a profit, although he claimed otherwise. It was fun walking around for an afternoon, but I can see that many would not appreciate the hard selling from the merchants. Keep saying \"no thanks\" and walk on. Also, remember the number on the gate where you entered, as it very easy to get lost strolling down the myriad aisles. Although many places take credit cards, the price will always be less if you pay cash, so take Turkish lira preferably."

( some may well be). The grand bazaar is so established that I do not think you can get a genuine bargain. Example. Iznik jug in a shop with no bartering by blue mosque 180 tl. Shop in bazaar 425tl. If you offer half price you still pay more than you should. Highlights were wandering around the streets and seeing the different mosques , the Galata bridge with the fishermen selling their freshly cooked mackerel in bread. The spice market is a sensory revelation. The station is the end of the old orient express and has a lively cafe. Right next to the station is the oldest baklava house on the corner which is well worth a visit. Sunset and nighttime is great to go back to The Hagia Sophia and blue mosque to take pictures"

Walking is such a great way to get to know a place.As we crossed over to the old city we noticed the Spice Bazaar straight ahead so we explored it and then headed to the Hagia Sophia Museum. This was the only place we visited that had an entrance fee (30 TL pp). They are currently renovating this so we didn't get to see as much as I suspect we would have otherwise. We stopped for a fresh juice there which was lovely but definitely pricey compared to what you can buy on the street.Next stop was the Blue Mosque which was beautiful and then on to the Grand Bazaar which is amazing. We only walked part of it on this day as we were both tired with all the walking. I am sure it would be easy to spend at least half a day here.I loved that there is very little hassling from people to buy their goods. The Turkish people are so friendly and helpful.I would recommend having a map but then just wandering around the Spice and Grand Bazaars and when you are tired of them asking someone to show you where you are on the map rather than stressing about where you are all the time. We spent most of the day wandering and occasionally checking the map to make sure we knew approx. where we were. Definitely make this part of your trip to Istanbul."

The historic areas of Istanbul has a lot to offer, and a couple of day tours with a good guide will have you covered. There are many interesting things to see, and a lot of them involve walking from one place to another. The city is very hilly, and if you plan to walk a lot, be sure to wear really comfortable shoes. It has a lot to offer in terms of its vibrant history and culture. My suggestion is that you go around and see some of the less visited places too. For example, although Blue Mosque is lovely, Rustam Pasha Mosque makes for a really nice visit too, because it has something different to offer. Spice Bazaar and Grand Bazaar are the places to visit, but I found some really nice items at smaller, less touristy bazaars at significantly lesser prices.A couple of bad experiences with taxi drivers in Istanbul over the first two days of my visit (they claimed they had no change, or something was wrong with the meter and took more money, or dropped us about a 7 min walk away from the Taksim square when we asked to be dropped off at the square) made us stick to Uber, which we were extremely happy with. Be sure to visit a public hammam while in the City; its one of those Turkish experiences you don't want to miss. Loved the city ! will be back"

Day 1: We arrived in Istanbul around 4pm from London and managed to get to our hotel around 5pm (Muyan Suites \u2013 a fantastic place to stay \u2013 ranked 21 out of 11,000 places in Istanbul. They were ranked 3rd when we booked it at the time. The owner Aslan and Taner are fantastic people who made our stay a very pleasant one. I promised them that I\u2019d recommend them to everyone \u2013 so here\u2019s my recommendation!). We freshen up after having an excellent relaxing late afternoon at Muyan and decided to go out for an evening meal. We managed to find an excellent restaurant called \u2018Rami\u2019 where we were taken to a rooftop table with a very close view of the Blue Mosque. We had our meal there and we had a wonderful time listening to the prayers/music throughout. After the meal, we had a late night stroll around the shops and having a great time talking to the Turkish people. They are very friendly and respectful \u2013 they didn\u2019t pressure us to buy things \u2013 it was just friendly persuasion to purchase things! After an hour we went back to the hotel to get some well earned sleep!Day 2: Our first full day, after an excellent breakfast at Muyan, we headed for the ferry to take a 2hr trip around the Bosphorus. When we purchased the tickets we were told we leave in 10 minutes and that there will only be 20 tourists maximum on the boat. Instead we found ourselves waiting on the boat for an hour before it departed as the boatowner was trying to squeeze in many tourists as he could which ended up around 40+! We forgave him quickly as it was a lovely sunny day and we had a great 2 hours going along the Golden Horn first before heading back to Ataturk bridge to venture the other end where we saw all the landmarks (Dol palace, Princes Island, Istanbul University, Modern Museum etc). After the ferry trip we decided to cross the bridge to go over to the other side where we found Galata Tower, we then found a nice place for lunch (meze) further up the hill. After lunch we then found Cukurcuma street where we found a lovely quaint museum called Museum of Innocence (past TomTom street). It was an excellent museum which lasted an hour. The Museum was based on the Novel (same title as museum) by the legendary Orhan Pamuk who wrote the book about Kemal and his love for a poor woman and they apparently met at the building (where the museum is situated). My wife got free entrance to the museum because she had read the book and took the book along with her to prove she had read it. The book get stamped and you enter the museum free \u2013 there is apparently a ticket on the back page of the book and it get stamped. I recommend people to visit this museum, not just because the museum is brilliant, but the location around it is quieter and the ambience is soothing. Afterwards we headed back to the other side and decided to visit the Spice Market. We bought Turkish Delights, Jasmine Tea and Saffron from Stall 51 (yes a specific stall \u2013 because stall 51 was filmed by the BBC last year for Rick Stein\u2019s programme \u2018From Venice to istanbul\u2019 and we managed to find the lady who owns the stall \u2013 think her name is Bilic. She has great knowledge of the spices and we managed to have a chat with her while buying the ingredients there). Thereafter we then accidently bumped into the Grand Bazaar which we managed to get ourselves lost within it for 2 hours before finding our hotel again! After freshening up we then had our next evening meal and an excellent place (the name escapes me) where we had the best figs and cloves ever for pudding! Then we had an late evening stroll before heading back to Muyan.Day 3: We decided to do the old town and visit all the landmarks. We started off with the Blue Mosque which was a lovely place, the interior designs is amazing. Then we headed for the Basilica Cistern which is a real treat \u2013 I really recommend this place. It is an underground cistern that was built around 550AD by Justinian I and the place is amazing! It was very dark inside, but was lighten up with yellow lamps alongside the pillars of the cistern. We saw fishes swimming along the water which was breathtaking. We finally found the legendary Medusa head which is upside down and her \u2018sister\u2019 whose head is tilted sideways. After this, we then visited the Hagia Sophia which was a very interesting 2 hours \u2013 the mosaics was great to see after it was originally plastered away during the Ottoman period. We then had streetfood lunch \u2013 Simic and corn on the cob for a pricey 4 LIRA \u2013 just one pound! Great simple food. Then we decided to walk to Topkapi Palace and visit the park. After that we had Turkish coffee and baklavas at a caf\u00e9 as a treat and to rest our legs. We then decided that no trip is completed without a Turkish Massage \u2013 so for 115Lira each, my wife and I had a traditional massage. It was a fantastic experience, a little painful but well worth the pain! I tipped the man 20 Lira and he seemed very happy with that tip especially after I had no idea what the going rate was for a tip. Feeling very refreshed we headed back to the hotel for a little rest before freshening up to go for the last evening meal. As expected \u2013 it was another great evening and we made sure we tried all the traditionals \u2013 sumac, suvec etc. Turkey do simple food, yet the experience is much better than these complicated fancy international cusine.Day 4: We had to go back to Ataturk Airport around 11am as it was the start of Eid festival and we didn\u2019t want to be held up in traffic/delays. We were worried for nothing as there was no major traffic or delays and we managed to have a safe journey back to London which is 10 degrees colder than Istanbul. We both agreed we had a fantastic time in Istanbul as it was a magical experience and will recommend all friends to visit there and that they should have no concerns with the safety issues and the current political climate. The children loved our presents that we bought for them (evil eyes, bath robes, Turkish delights, bracelets etc).Lastly I want to thank the legenday Enigma2007 who I have secretly been following his comments on this forum for the past 9 months so that I could have a taste of what to expect in Istanbul. I recommend people to follow him \u2013 he has been very thorough and I hope that he enjoys my views of Istanbul. Happy Eid to everyone \u2013 Istanbul is a real treasure and we will visit again no doubt.To anyone who has any concerns about Istanbul in terms of safety \u2013 don\u2019t \u2013 it is very safe and no more dangerous than London, Paris and new York. EVERYONE is friendly."

Three empires that left major imprints, many cultures, mercantile spirit and Mediterranean sea that opens mental vistas and expands views - that is Istanbul in a nutshell and it is unforgettable! We spent 5 wonderful days in this crazy city and already want to come back since there is so much more to see and experience. The heart of old town, Sultanahmet offers the best cultural and historical attractions as well as many options for great dining and entertainment. Just walking around we came across friendly, courteous, gregarious people, some of them merchants, politely but unwaveringly trying to lure us into their carpet or other shops that were hard to ignore and townspeople happy to socialize. The museums were fantastic, layers and layers of civilizations leaving their mark - Hagia Sophia's amazing architecture and mosaics was awe-inspiring and left us speechless, Topkapi Palace's gorgeous tiles from Iznik adorning it's walls with the genius of the architect Mimar Sinan's structures within the palace and little gems like the Haseki Hurrem Sultan Hammami just outside Aya Sophia also designed by Mimar Sinan brought joy to the beholder. The Grand Bazaar was an incomparable experience itself with trying to dodge merchants everywhere vying for your business. One thing is for sure - do not buy anything at first sight, there are no price tags so bargaining is implied. It is almost a battle of wits who will outsmart who: the merchant the shopper or vice-versa! This is a socializing event, too, it wouldn't be interesting if you just paid and walked away! Such fun! The experience of entering a mosque for the first time was unique, it was in the Blue Mosque-the Sultan Ahmed Mosque-lovely blue tiles adorn the walls thus the name, it is also an active mosque with strict attire rules of removing shoes and wearing clothes that cover knees and shoulders as well as head cover for women. You are given plastic bags in which you place your shoes while touring the interior. Be sure to wear socks!!! The carpet that lines the interior is definitely in need of replacing, the odor was bad. We stayed at the inimitable Four Seasons on the Bosphorus, an unforgettable experience in itself, so we had to take a taxi every time to get to the old town that was c. 7km away but it was well worth it, taxi fares are more than reasonable and function smoothly. We were told to always find a legal taxi, there are \"wild\" taxis that charge much more and to go to the Four Seasons in Sultanahmet where we were to ask the doorman to call a taxi. It is true because when we hailed a taxi on the street he wanted double the amount that we normally paid! All in all our visit to Byzantium/Constantinople/Istanbul is carved in our memory and hearts forever and left us with fond memories."

Other points of interest would be the Basilica Cistern, an underground cavernous area where you'll find a large stone upside down head of Medusa, and the Topkapi Palace with its many ornate rooms and gardens. You will have an amazing time!"

Despite the lateness of the season, there were still blossoms to be smelled in the gardens and spices to be savored in the markets. Everywhere you look there is history and this history is being preserved and incorporated into the tourist life blood of this wonderful city. Ataturk created this modern and secular nation-state and his wisdom is paying handsome dividends. Here the past is acknowledged and preserved for future generations to study and enjoy, in a safe and welcoming country. Visiting all of the attractions -- the Mosques & Topkapi and strolling the hippodrome are a \"must do.\" So are the evening adventures. You have to visit the Grand Bazaar and just enjoy the sights and listen to the languages and see the rhythm of their lives. Get some Turkish coffee and smoke some nargilia (water pipe). Watch a football match in a cafe or play backgammon with some old guys. This is a great place to hang out and Americans need to hang out more. We were strolling across a plaza near the Obelisk and a street vendor called out \"hello!\" and I smiled and waved him off and he said \"Are you from Canada?\" I was curious so I said \"Yes, how did you know?\" He said \"The Americans don't smile. They are always looking down.\" I told my friends and they'd agreed. They all started looking up (still watching for missing stones) but smiling more and relaxing. This is a safe city where the people are genuinely warm. Don't worry about the restaurant you pick -- they have over 11,000 so if you only go to the top 10% you still have over 1,000 choices that will be excellent. The food in this area is excellent - you're hardest choice is ambiance."

Google for Turyol or another company (sorry can't remember the name) that also provides service for water taxi connecting Eminonu ( the main ferry hub situated besides Galata Bridge) to Besiktas or Uskudar. Those two are the cheapest option as they didn't come with foods or drinks but you can still purchase on your own right? Also do try the famous fish sandwich called \"Balik ekmek\" which are sold by few stalls at Galata Bridge for 8 Turkish Lira.

If you are not that in to tourist shopping their is plenty of time to see the Grand Bazaar on the same day. If you want tourist knock off crap you may need more time at the Bazaar. On the second day see the Mosque of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Spice Bazaar, and the public ferry of the Golden Horn all on the same day. For hand rolled Turkish Delights go to Gozde in the Spice Bazzar.It helps greatly to read about these sights before you go or use Tours By Locals."

Important ones are so badly maintained. People walk on the grass areas which should be kept off limits to preserve the aesthetic beauty of the place. Security is quite lapse. The traffic around the city is horrendous. Local restaurants cheat you with offering you extremely extremely expensive fish. They try this trick with showing you fresh fish in a basket and when you fall for it, they charge you an absolute bomb. Sweets I bought from a tour operator recommended family run business in the spice market was full of maggots. Complete cheats and very untrustworthy."

You Must agree with them in advance to use meter..... be careful they may flip the meter to show FM frequency as a trip cost !!! Don't go in tourists groups to these areas, it will waste your time waiting the groups, discover it yourself!Everything is overpriced in these places when it is for tourists.... be careful and smart to buy souvenirs from proper places.

Food is bland they don\u2019t know what salt means and chilly hardly used some restaurant rip you off so go for take-away near Blue Mosque where spice market is their donner is very tasty do not travel from Gatwick in Turkish Airline as they use DC10 and you will end up with a bumpy ride all the way including landing and take-off so use Heathrow Terminals Air Line service is not up to requested standard if you watch their documentary it shows all is well nothing like it take electric tea kettle at least you can make tea/coffee in your own time. Use bigger ferry as it is value for money six hours journey is worth it you will enjoy it plan before you set off and stick to it.

We took a cabin on a 36 cabin boat from Athens through the Greek Isles to Istanbul \u2013 great cruise on the Variety Voyager. So Istanbul \u2013 we stayed near the water on the street full of old elegant bank buildings most of which are now hotels or galleries. It is the area between the Galata Tower and the water below it and sometimes is referred to as Karakoy. Tip #1 - Don\u2019t get a guide . The quality of guides in Istanbul was so much lower than in the historical sites on the Turkish coast we visited as we came up from Athens. Two issues \u2013 they are just not well qualified \u2013 saying no more than in your guide book and next, a lot of your money goes on the lunch at a restaurant run by the bus company. Tip # 2 \u2013 get a tram pass \u2013 there is an excellent tram which runs from the Dolmabache Palace in the CBD end of the city, through to the area we stayed at and through to all the key sites in the old city. Clean, fast , efficient \u2013 it snakes right up to all the tourist spots you are likely to fit in. Alternatively there is the big open top bus \u2013 we did not but we saw it at every place we went so it would have been quite good. Tip # 3 \u2013 Museum pass \u2013 we didn\u2019t because we unwisely booked a group tour, but it is a queue saver if noting else. Several locations though do not recognise it. Most sites you wish to see are only 10 to 15 mins slow walk apart and close to the tram stops."

The part of Istanbul where you will enjoy historical and cultural treasure from Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman era represents the huge Sultanahmet square. If you have limited time, make your priorities and make every minut of your visit worthy.HOW TO GET TO SULTANAHMET SQUAREIt is easy accesible by tram line T1 or metro line Zeytinburn-Kabata\u0161 /get off at Sultanahmet sq. stop/. A more beautiful option is drive by tourist buses get on&get off. They have stop in front of Blue mosque.WHAT TO VISITThe major attractions represent: Blue mosque (Sultanahmet mosque), Haghia Sophia, Topkapi palace and Basilica Cistern. These sights are located within walking distance. Only problem are long lines in front of these sights. For example, only visit to Topkapi palace involves four hours at least. Also, long lines plus visit to each of other mentioned attractions involve a half day.Walking along the narrow and winding streets of this area is really beautiful experience. I came across the charming traditional Turkish houses beautifully painted in blue, green, red color. Also, walk along Soqukcesme street, that runs parallel to the walls of Topkapi palace and you will find the wooden houses, typical examples of Ottoman architecture.I would like to mention two beautifully decorated fountains worth your admiration. The first one is the Fountain of Ahmet III in rococo style with adorable tiles and valuable inscription in front of Topkapi palace. The second one is the Fountain of Emperor Wilhelm II with polished granite columns and gold mosaic dome in front of Blue mosque. TAKE A BREAKWhen you get tired, and feel thirst and hunger, it is time for break. There are stands with refresments at Sultanahmet square. They offer traditional Turkish ice-cream, different kinds of fruit, freshly made natural juices.If you are in mood to have a break at table, don't miss cafes/restaurants located on the top of the buildings in this area. You will be rewarded with an amazing view.PAY ATTENTION TO:Be ready to wait in long lines in front of the attractions. Because, Istanbul is pretty warm and sunny city in September and October, don't forget to bring with yourself a bottle of water and the essential items as like a hat, a sun protection creme, a sun glasses and the city map.Enjoyable time quaranteed!"

The world's only transcontinental city - the truest meeting of east and west. While we both looked forward to our trip eagerly and counted down the days to get there, we could have never anticipated our reaction to this breathtaking city. Long story short - we fell head over heels in love. Whether it was the innumerable shades of blue that colored the cityscape, or the lavish and delectable breakfast spreads, the hills that made our calves burn or the 14th century buildings that just seemed to pop out of every street corner, we do not know what made us lose our hearts to Istanbul. All we know is it has forever melded to our souls.The historic areas were an absolute delight. Couple of quick tips, make sure you pace yourself and don't try to do all of Sultanahmet at once, come back for a few hours every day - Istanbul is very easy to get around and its only when you do a few trips that you'll understand the layers to the city. Also, the monuments ( Aya Sofya, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace) can be completely overwhelming if you try to cram them into short periods, and being so majestic, they deserve dedicated time of their own. And finally, make sure you visit some of the lesser known monuments - they are treasures in their own right."

Istanbul has thousands of years of history and you can get some of the sense of that impressiveness by just walking around the old streets.Up front I will make a note of security concerns. (I never felt unsafe at any time while walking in daylight - but I'm a man and I'm quite a veteran traveller.) During just 2 day I witnessed people selling drugs, police chasing illegal street traders, and gangs of children (presumably syrian refugees) bursting into the restaurant and snatching food from tables. Quite impressive for 4 hours.There is a clear need to be aware of the security situation if you are travelling to Istanbul. I doubt that I would let my daughter roam around freely in this city.Having said that - there are some amazing spectacles and the old town in particular is very easy to get about. Just walk!It's hot in the sun - so cover up and keep hydrated - but if you are an explorer like me then you can't help but be enchanted by the old and busy streets. This city is no relic - it's a living, breathing entity."

Our guide showed us how to use public transportation as she introduced us to the city's beautiful mosques and palaces. We were able to wander on our own after that first day. Istanbul is an easy city to negotiate since nearly everyone speaks English. They are a friendly, proud of their country people. We stopped to eat Turkish food at restaurants with outdoor seating at tiny alleyways throughout this part of Istanbul. The only complaint we had is that the Turkish people smoke like crazy. We had to get used to eating with smokers nearby. Cruise along the Bosphoros for 3Euro is such a deal!"

He is very grateful and offers a free shine, and will not take no for an answer. Having insisted on you removing your shoes to get a better job done he will then refuse to return them until you have paid a serious sum (in my case the equivalent of \u00a320) IF A SHOE SHINE GUY DROPS HIS BRUSH IN FRONT OF YOU - IGNORE IT!! As a bit of fun I started to count how many times it happened : in 3 weeks, about 35 times!! They have some kind of trigger mechanism on their kit to release the brush which on one occasion I attempted to get an an explanation of - the guy was not to pleased, and by then 3 shoe shiners made it clear that my enquiry was very unwelcome.

It was later rebuilt using stone masonry and Tower was refered to as Christea Turris or Christ Tower by the Genoese in 1348. The straights of Bhosporous is a busy lane for ships plying to trade.The Tower was then captured by the Turks when Istanbul was conquered in 1453 and the city Constantinople was renamed as Istanbul and some historians refered the original name of Istanbul after 'Islambol' or City of Islam.The Tower itself is 66.90 meters high from the ground level and 140 meters from the sea level. It has a measurement in diameter of 8,95 meters and thickness of the wall 3.75 meters. It is a must visit place of interest in Istanbul.It is best to visit in the early morning at 9.30 am when there is less visitors and a clear sky to have a 360 degrees view of Istanbul. There is platform to walk and view the city and marvelous view of the Bosphorus. They have opened up a cafe on top for visitors to have the taste of Turkish cuisine while enjoying the magnificient view of the city and the Bosphorus. There is also a photo studio to take photos well dressed like a Sultan and the Queen which is highly recommended and of course a souvinir shop at the base of the Tower. All round the Tower is full of cafes and dining establishments as well as souvenir shops selling made in Turkey products and popular for hang outs and those taking pictures.Galata Tower is a little down hill if you come from the direction of Taksim Square using the Istiklal where the oldest tram still running in the city from Galata Tower to Taksim Square and vice versa. Well get to Galata Tower when you are in Istanbul and you will never be dissapointed. We simly love it.Saharudin & MariamVisiting 22-26 August 2015Reporting 02 September 2014."

A crash course starting from Constantinople and Eastern Roman Empire, through the Byzantine Era and then the Ottoman dynasty with its colourful characters, and finally the revolution and the birth of a 90% Muslim majority, secular republic in the 30s by Kemal Attaturk ; it is a city that has stood and watched time pass by. It is probably the only place where a 6th century gold mosaic of Madonna and the Child is next to the Name of Allah inscribed in gold on a 18th century plate - reflecting a high level of tolerance of faith."

The Topkapi Palace was huge and although parts were interesting, it became an overwhelming flood of different tiles after awhile. We got burn out during the harem walk through. More of a commentary on frustrated artists who can't do anything but flowers than an artistic triumph.  You run into Constantines City Wall all over the place and can see the level of thought and work it took to make it."

DO NOT accept the invitation of many guides trying to tell you they can get you in without waiting in line, the Museum Card will do that. The bargain they offer is not a bargain.

We spent 3 days in Istanbul.Here are a few suggestions if it helps anyone planning a visit.Chose your preferences: Are you the traveler who A. likes to tick off all \"places of interest\"B. likes to be lazy and self indulgent and curious about the local lifeC. likes cuisine and pub toursIf A. - definitely stay in the old part near the main mosque, plan the iterinary well since there are MANY places to see and there are queues and tickets everywhere. Chose early morning or evening times, buy the multi-ticket which allows many places to be covered. Buy audio guides for each museum etc since it definitely adds to the experience and knowledge. Rest during the day - it does get tiring. There are enough places to see - tripadvisor is the best place to know which they areIf B. prioritise 1-2 monuments to see based on reviews and a bit of google so you can be picky and choosy - no point in planning to see ALL worth-seeing places. Make a list of good local foods and desserts (YES this is a big set to chose from) - right from local street foods, to specific cuisines etc. Fit it into the schedule. Walk around and take local trams without any specific agenda and spend atleast 4-5 hours just walking. It gives a wonderful feel of the city. People going to work, children going to school, local shoppers, restaurant owners, street side vendors, etc. I would highly recommend a good 4-5 hours on local boats which go from one town to another on the Bosphorus - getting on and off wherever you fancy - eating street foods and sitting and watching people. Fit in local fruit juices, ice creams and desserts (from proper shops). Laze, read, walk, sit, watch, eat, drink.If C. focus on building up an apetite 3 times a day to truly enjoy the vast cuisine and restaurant options. I did enjoy the local fish sandwiches, the baked stuffed potato in jackets, the grilled fish, the meat roasted in the clay pots.... the kekab dishes seemed bland. There just is so much to eat and experiment - the trick is to be hungry enough!An observation I would like to share:I did not find the local people in hotels and restaurants very customer service and hospitality oriented. My explanation is that Istanbul gets so many tourists that there is a complacency and local people do not try too hard to be hospitable. If the tourism industry gets more competitive maybe they would try harder. Even average hotels get a lot of tourists without trying hard to be very nice to people.Also, the local Turks identify themselves with the Americans or at best the Europeans.. and feel superior as compared to some races. I noticed rude behaviour towards a Chinese group of ladies, a black gentleman, and sometimes towards brown skin people. Its subtle, but its there. That's strange because people thriving on tourism would normally be more practical about being benefits of being hospitable. Only in the small restaurants where is stiff competition to pull in tourists did I find the hospitality levels to match those in Asia.. in other places, it was very dependent on the specific personality of the individual you would be interacting with. All in all - the sheer beauty of the ancient architecture, clubbed with the scenic bosphorus, and the vast amount of foods and drinks to be sampled.. its a holiday to remember!"

Within the historic areas of Istanbul you can find remnants of the Roman (Hippodrome), Byzantine (Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern) and Ottoman (Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace) empires. Hagia Sophia, one of the world's most amazing buildings is just 5-6 mins' walk away from the Blue Mosque (a masterpiece of Islamic architecture that gives Hagia Sophia a run for its money) and Topkapi Palace (where the sultans ruled one of the largest empires on Earth for over 400 years) is another 3 mins' walk from Hagia Sophia. You can also enjoy a very nice view of the Bosphorus from the Topkapi Palace grounds. While usually safe, just be careful of carpet scammers and because it is always crowded keep your wits about you. If you go in winter (went in February 2013) the crowds for the biggest tourist draws, in particular Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque are much smaller and you can enjoy taking in the sights a little better."

I highly recommend the Topkapi Palace but was not able to do the Harem Tour, ran out of time and it was separate to the general admission. I was disappointed we could not take photos of the incredible rubies, diamonds and emeralds in the Sultans palace, adorning everything from swords and weaponry to wedding garments and ceremonial gear. Make sure you look out over the harbour through the picturesque arches, wonderfully dramatic light and shadows there. I love the amazing skyline and the way the mosques and architecture cut such an impressive silhouette and will be including it in my upcoming paintings, very inspiring. I really enjoyed the Grand Bazaar and Spice Markets but would suggest you don't go on a weekend or when there are cruise ships in the harbour to avoid the crush of people. I really enjoyed the Aya Sophia and the Blue Mosque but it was too crowded the day i went. i really enjoyed the Pasha Rustem smaller chapel just as much and not crowded at all, beautiful array of blue, green and red tiles! Walking is a great way to see down all the little alleyways and really experience the local people going about their day."

We had a day trip booked Which was fine but didn't even scratch the surface. Luckily our agent had persuaded us to fly back to Istanbul from Venice at the end of the cruise and spend more time there as well as Cappadocia. Just as well we had done the Blue Mosque and other places of worship we didn't have to spend more time looking at churches. By that time of our trip, we were all churched out. If you go to the Grand Bazaar, venture right into the middle and you will find some fair dinkum wares. The stuff on the outside that is all aimed is stuff that is mostly made in China. Your guide will tell you that. There is so much stuff underground and you have to realize that it is around a couple of thousand years old. When the city got wiped out and covered by natural disasters, earthquakes etc, the next mob just built on top of what was buried. The underground is amazing with the Cistern being the highlight in my opinion. On the surface is the old Hippodrome, a la Ben Hur. Which you can walk around and imagine all sorts of wonderful things. The hotel we stayed in, the Erisen Crown Hotel is part made up with the Roman Wall that surrounded the whole city. In a small room on the ground floor, there is a hale in the floor, maybe one meter that has a glass panel covering it. At the bottom is a beautiful Roman Mosaic. History is every where. Across the road from the hotel there is a small restaurant. I forget but it is called the black something. The food is great and the beer is spot on. Driving around the city, there is always something to ooh aah at. The people are very good and will never fail to help if they can. Don't think about it, do it."

Trips booked on ship or be cruise lines tend to be expensive and we therefore considered this to be an excellent and less expensive alternative.We used the Big Bus Tours buses. The first circuit lasts about 2 hours and the second about 90 minutes. Your ticket covers both.Picked up bus just outside the cruise terminal. This is stop number 2A.Istanbul is always very busy so it is best to travel around early. Traffic and pollution increases by afternoon and everyone we spoke to had found it oppressive.It was a nice ride up to the The Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia which lie opposite each other across Sultanahmet square. This is a very nice and lively area with fountains plus food stalls. Most people got off here as the Grand Bazaar market is a short walk uphill. There is a tram which would get you there in 3 stops if you prefer.The Grand Bazaar is a colourful market is always very busy, hot and you are most likely to be called into every shop to \u201cjust look\u201d and buy. Stall holders however are very polite and a friendly \u201cno\u201d is acceptable.Crossing the Bosphorus Bridge was nerve racking as it was very windy when we crossed in both directions. Bridge is very high and a few people on the top deck looked quite concerned and worried. This experience was worthwhile as you cross over from Europe into Asia.Our bus was not too busy and no one had any problems getting on at any stop which was good as many stops had beggars, either some children or a mother and child.Would recommend this as a means to quickly see the city and note where next to go if you have time."

The people are very friendly and there are some wonderful sights. We had a two hour cruise down the Bosphorous where we got a better understanding of the size of Istanbul and appreciated the beauty of it. All for 12 euros each. You have to visit the spice market and Grand bazaar where you can easily spend another hour - or two if you want to shop. Try the Turkish Delight - it's awesome! And have a proper kebab. Nothing like the rubbish they serve in the UK! There were so many things we didn't have time to do but I'm glad we chose to wander round the city rather than go on a tour."

The history and sights of Istanbul are outstanding, Hagia Sofia being the highlight, haven't seen the inside of building that wowed me as much since. The bosphorus tour by boat was great, dolmance palace another outstanding tour, food fine in most places the only downside was the feeling of being the only westerners in most parts of the old city, felt very uncomfortable as 2 lone females walking around getting stared at. Glad of the experience though."

Therefore, there are many mosques, churches, synagogues and worth visiting historic palaces in the city. Among the main sites are the Hagia Sophia also called Church of the Divine Wisdom and Hagia Sophia (Ayasofya Camii). Today it is a museum and the Blue Mosque Sultanahmet Camii. The area is well kept. Very clean, and very well protected. You can go around without any worries. There are many shops, restaurants and tourist service all around the town. There are internal passages, full of restaurants and bars, but I speak of streets and allies that once inside you get lost and do not know where you're going to leave. The area is full of tourist and young people especially, the atmosphere is great, no \"weird\" things nothing dangerous, I assure you that is fascinating. Be prepared for long walks and drinking lots of water if visiting during summer. Dont forget sun screen lotion."

Rather than visiting this in morning, it is better to reach there around 3 pm, as the major rush is is in the morning. This way you will save on the waiting time. The Blue Mosque can be visited anytime you wish. Hagia Sofia also is a must visit. This is the old church turned to a mosque. This closes at 6.00 pm so select your time accordingly. The fourth key place to visit is the Basilica cistern. This will give you an idea how the water was distributed in the city. All these attractions can be covered in one day and they can all be covered by foot. Two other major attractions are the Dolmabahce Palace, which is situated near Kabatas, and the Galata Tower, which is in Beyoglu district. Keep around 2 hours for the Palace and around 30 minutes for the tower. All of these attractions have an entrance fee."

My wife and I visited for five days in June as part of a self-devised itinerary of four locations in Turkey and this is a place where we can\u2019t wait to return. five days was just not enough as there is always so much more to do and see than first anticipated plus you don\u2019t want to rush around Istanbul and found ourselves spending more than than usual just sitting, people watching and taking in the ambience of this great city. We stayed at Cheers hostel in the middle of Sultanahmet, the heart of Old Constantinople. Cheers is perfect for students and single travellers, in dorms, or couples, in the annexe a few streets away (see my separate article).Based on our experience, here is a list of things to do and see and some helps and tips based on our experience and wishing we had known before what we know now. Bear in mind that attractions in Sultanahmet are close together but allow time to sit, relax and enjoy the ambience. Some places mean you will need to either walk or use public transport and sometimes wait in queues for major attractions so allow extra time.ISTANBUL IN ONE DAYIf you only have one day, which is a shame, here is what I recommend.Sultanahmet SquareAya SofiaBasilica CisternBlue MosqueWalk around Sultanahmet backstreetsISTANBUL IN TWO DAYSAdd:Eminonu docksGalata TowerNew MosqueSpice Bazaar/Egyptian BazaarSuleymaniye MosqueIstanbul UniversityBeyazit ParkGrand BazaarHere is a full day sightseeing walk that we did using a local map and Lonely Planet book:Take the tram from Sultanahmet to Eminonu and walk up the pretty cobbled street to the tower which you can visit for a small fee and take the lift to the top to look over the Golden Horn and get a panorama over Istanbul. Walk back over Galata Bridge to Eminonu docks, watching the line of fisherman on the side of the bridge. Take in the views over the Golden Horn and the bustling crowds around the docks and the New Mosque. Down here you will also find the Spice Bazaar/Egyptian Bazaar plus the oldest Turkish Delight shop in the world. Walk up the hill behind the Spice Bazaar to the Suleymaniye Mosque where you can get fine views of the Golden Horn towards Galata and Beyoglu. This mosque is also much quieter than Sultanahmet\u2019s Blue mosque. Walk over the road into the grounds of the 15th century Istanbul University, have a look round the campus and onwards through Beyazit Park with its magnificent tower that you can see from everywhere in Istanbul. Head towards the Grand Bazaar passing through the no-knock flea market. get completely lost in the Grand Bazaar for a few hours, try your hand at bargaining and take loads of photos of the colourful displays of spices and Turkish Delight. Don\u2019t forget to take the view from the outside and the grand entrances. Walk to Beyazit tram stop and take the tram back to Sultanahmet.ISTANBUL IN THREE DAYSAdd:Big Bus Blue TourHop on and off around the Golden HornBosporus Cruise (2 hours is enough)Big Bus Red TourISTANBUL IN FOUR OR MORE DAYSAdd:Theodosian city wallsWalk around the backstreets of Sultanahmet to see the Ottoman Houses and Kucuk Aya Sofia (Little Aya Sofia)Princes IslandsFerry across to Asian IstanbulBus or tram to the districts of Beyoglu, Taksim, Galatasaray, Kadikoy.Dolmabahce PalaceHINTS AND TIPSGet an Istanbulkart at one of the various kiosks and put 10 lira on it. The Istanbulkart gets you almost half fare on the tram and can be used on all public transport. Whether you are a single traveller, couple or family, you will only need one card - just pass it back between you and each fare will be deducted. Top it up at any tram stop.Don\u2019t just stay in Sultanahmet Square - wander around the backstreets and further afield. If you get tired, take the tram or bus back.Don\u2019t just eat at night - walk into Sultanahmet Square and people watch. It is usually full of locals and tourists taking pictures of the illuminated buildings and having picnics.Getting around - Sultanahmet Square has the big attractions and is all pedestrianised and walkable. Disabled access in this area is also good but just ask about access for wherever you visit. to go further afield, use the tram, bus, ferry or simply walk. Eating - Istanbul is full of restaurants, cafes, locates and take aways so you won\u2019t go hungry. Sultanahmet has an abundance of nice eateries in the little backstreets opposite the tram stop. Anatolia is particularly nice for an evening meal (see separate review). Best done opposite the tram stop is great for take away kebabs and you can either eat them outside the kebab shop or walk across the road to the park. Prices are on a par with other popular tourist destinations in Turkey (although Cappadocia is much cheaper) and main meals seemed to be between 22 and 35 lira with fish usually cheaper than meat.Drinking - Most restaurants serve beer and alcohol but if you are in Sultanahmet and want a couple of cans to take back to your hotel, there is a little off licence on Yurdu Sokak, again in the mix of backstreets behind the tram stop.Money - There are various ATMs on Divanyolu Caddesi that give the proper official rate of the day. There are also many exchange bureaus that give almost the same official rate for many currencies and if we had known this, we would have taken a wad of sterling. Many shops and restaurants are priced in euros but lira is still the best.Information - Tourist information is thin on the ground so pick up leaflets from your hotel. Better still, brush up your knowledge with the Rough Guide and lonely planet who publish great guides on both Turkey and just Istanbul. also, take note of what myself and others are writing in reviews and visit the Turkish Travel planner website at www.turkeytravelplanner.com. Maps are available at some places but again, get one before you leave home and brush up on your knowledge.To recap, just enjoy Istanbul, absorb it, do what you can in the time you have there\u2026 and return another day to do more."

We decided to stay a week in the city instead of going to other places to get a full taste of what this great place had to offer. I do not regret that. A week was perfect for us.These are a few tips on places to eat, what to see, where to stay, etc.Stay: We stayed at Corinne Hotel over at Beyoglu (this is a neighborhood in the new part of the city in the European side). This hotel was AMAZING!. I have only the best things to say about the cleanness, location, restaurant (OMG the breakfast is to die for), staff, customer service, etc. This was the best choice we could have made at a very reasonable price.To do: Spice Bazar: I liked the bazar. For us it was better to visit this one, before the grand Bazar. You will see a lot of spices, teas, perfumes, etc. It is a treat to the senses. However- we ended up spending more than what we would have paid for things outside. We made the mistake of stopping at the second stand, and although they were very nice, and it was quite an experience, we really ended up paying up almost double as what we would if we would have waited and shopped more. Mosques: Blue Mosque,Rustem Pasha and Suleymanie. This last one was by far the one that I liked the most, although is was not advertised and promoted as much as the others- not sure why. It was not crowded, it has a nice park to just sit and let everything sink in. There are visitor info guides that will explain about the history of the Mosque and Islam. They were very nice and the information was very helpful for our upcoming days. We visited this Mosque first.Grand Bazzar: Great place to go, to understand a bit the history and significance of trade in the city. In terms of buying\u2026 I wouldn't buy anything there. These are the same items that are sold everywhere in the city, at much higher prices. So go, spend some time looking, taking pics, talking to locals, maybe drink a chai, and leave empty handed if you can ;)Palaces: Topkapi and Dolmabache. Both gorgeous and very different. For Topkapi, we took a \"tour\". In hindsight, this was not a great idea. The palace is so big and full of history that I would try to hire an individual guide. Sometimes they are in the front to the palace, or you could check with your hotel, or online. The tour took longer picking up passengers, and only briefly talked about the actual palace (about 1 hr). Perhaps it was our guide, but I would recommend you do this another way. You can also look online for apps that explain something about the palace, that is a great idea.Dolmabache palace includes a guide which was very very helpful. The palace is gorgeous and in my opinion, a MUST in your visit to Istanbul. Plan for 3 hrs or so.Museums: We only went to Hagia Sophia (mosque/cathedral turned museum). This was obviously one of the highlights of the trip. We hired a local private guide on the entrance of the museum for only $25USD approx for 2 people. Amazing guide, answered all of my questions, and then some. Best thing we did to really get the ins and outs of this amazing place.Shopping: A great place and neighborhood for shopping is Galata/Beyoglu. There is a little street in front of the Galata tower. It has everything that you need and want at more affordable prices than the bazaars. It is near the street of Istiklal- the big street and great for getting a flavor of the locals, a lot of shopping, and great restaurants around.Bosphorus trip: We did the hour and a half trip for the Bosphorus. We didn't want to wait for the whole day, and for us, it was just enough to get a feel of the city from the ocean, but not spend the entire day. Prices are very affordable (I believe around 6 USD per person), and great for a privately owned ferry.Relax- We decided to spend some hours relaxing and doing a picnic on the park near to Topkapi palace\u2026. great idea and views of the Bosphorus.I will post about eating places on another post, but hope these tips will help you in your travel! Istanbul is a great city to visit!"

I believe that Istanbul is the city that deserves the title \"the city that never sleeps\" in that there is always something going on. We hit the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, and the Basilica Cistern the day we arrived (we got in around 10ish in the morning). Blue Mosque and Aya Sofya definitely are worth doing, you could probably skip Basilica Cisterna as it is not all that impressive after you have been there a couple of minutes, but it is a nice escape from the heat. We ate at Khorasani that night, which was great. The next day we went to Topkapi Palace, the Archaeology Museum, and the Grand Bazaar. Topkapi was awesome, the Archaeology Museum was ok and if you are really into history will be especially interesting, and the Grand Bazaar should definitely not be missed. (Do not buy anything there, though, as the prices are insanely high.) We ate dinner at a little caf\u00e9 in Sultanahmet that night that I cannot remember the name of sadly, but that was very cheap and tasty, with a cool atmosphere of locals hanging out. We had a glass of wine as a night cap at The Sunrise Caf\u00e9 down the street from our hotel (Eresin Crown, which was awesome).The third day we hit Dolmabahce Palace, the most beautiful palace my husband and I have ever seen, then went to Kariye Museum. Skip Kariye unless you just love mosaics as this is extremely out of the way and not as impressive as you might think. We also went to the Heritage Nomadic Arts Center/ Museum right by Aya Sofya for a demonstration of the ancient Turkish art of marbling by Josh and then to see all the beautiful wares in the associated shop. This was a highlight and we are so glad we did it. This is actually where we ended up buying all of our souvenirs from the trip because they were so cheap and so beautiful. We had dinner at the Sunrise Caf\u00e9 that night with our new found friends Hakan and Ercan (the owner). Staying in Sultanahmet is a must, as nearly everything you'd want to see and do is well within walking distance and easily accessible."

Wandering in Istanbul through the obvious jewels of the city and the less obvious residential and small scale commercial areas is something everyone should do at some point in his or her life for there is much to learn about current day life and the ongoing force of history. No matter the challenges thrown at us by man and nature, Istanbul reminds us that time layers itself upon what has been and as Faulkner observes, the past is not past, it is all around us. Orhan Pamuk talks about the Turkish idea of Uz\u00fcn, a kind of melancholy that pervades Istanbul especially at certain times. He says this melancholy is particularly poignant in the decaying structures and reminders of an earlier, greater Istanbul. Economic and cultural cycles aside, what is remarkable is that Istanbul never stops, it has a force all its own that will keep it changing and going and it is this force that gives certainly the visitor a sense that we may, despite our destructive angels, make it through!"

We followed Rick Steves's audio tour that we had downloaded prior to our trip onto our phones and an iPod, and that helped us enjoy the ruins even more. There are audio tours available for rent there, too, so if you don't download anything in advance, you can still be guided through this ancient city where St. Paul wrote his first letter to the Corinthians.This is an ongoing archeological dig so in the years to come, more and more will be revealed. We took a quick flight from Istanbul, leaving there about 7 AM and arriving in Izmir about 8 AM. We then took a a train to Sel\u00e7uk, the hour-long ride taking us through areas that reminded me of Tuscany, only with mosques. In Sel\u00e7uk, we walked about 200 yards from the train station and hopped on one of the dolmus for the 3-minute ride to Ephesis, dropping us off at the lower entrance. Rick Steves's tour starts at the upper entrance so we hiked up the hill (about 15-minute walk) and began our tour. We spent about four hours at Ephesis and then retraced our steps with the dolmus, the train, and the plane, arriving back in Istanbul about 8 PM. This day-long side trip was totally worth it, and cost about US$200 total for us two. (Flight was US$75 pp rt, train was US$3 pp rt, dolmus was US$2 pp rt, tickets to Ephesis was US$12 each...see how inexpensive it all was?) BTW, we arranged our flight before we left the US as we were told that it would be cheaper to do that. That turned out to be true. The train tickets we bought on the spot, though, not in advance.Be sure to bring your camera, water, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen as you're out in the open sun for most of the time. A small snack would be great, too, eaten halfway through your time in Ephesus. There's a clean bathroom at the lower entrance which you should use before you begin--it'd be a long walk back if you had to go in the middle of your tour.Final thoughts: Go. Just go to Ephesus. You won't be sorry."

Firstly public transport in Istanbul is the cheapest and safest, it very modern and is supported by a network of helpers fond at barriers, you are saving a lot of money and time using the road network, the train goes directly from the airpot, if you arrive at the airpot you can get to taksim square in 40 minutes for \u00a32 per person (or \u00a31 with Istanbul card) You take the red m1a line and change at Yenikapi (to a different level take green line) then you arrive at taksim, no fuss no traffic, an easy journey , we managed easy with a large case, as did many others I saw on the train, we stopped in this area so we did this, I have included a map of the train system but their are trams and boats, all linked vey easily. We took the public boat from Eminonu to Kadikoy the bus to the large Tuesday market Asia side, the boat journey lasted about 1/2 hour for \u00a31 with Istanbul card the bus (I think we took the 19 at the but Station but people will tell you ) this cost 50p , great trip out too. All of the historic sites can be reached by the public transport, there are helpers in many strategic places with ASK ME t shirts.Lastly by an ISTANBUL CARD. For travel, you can share between as many people as you like they cow 6 tl, then you top it up , this will give you have price travel vey where including the public boats, real good value , by at the shops that look like a betting office if you can find one or people will direct you to small sops that sell them EXCELLENT VALUE , you can use as engrave to some public toilets too for 1 tl .In my opinion the public transport is the safest mode of transport, the roads are manic, lots of accidents just watch you bags always be aware of the people around you as in any city. I did not feel unsafe I this city 2 female travellers, mother & daughter"

Him, so grateful for your caring nature, drops down on one knee and offers to shine your shoe, seemingly for free. After shining your shoes, however, you learn that it was not for free and that he wants 35 TL per shoe!!

Sadly however, sleazy touts, cab drivers, restaurant hosts and homeless people leave foreigners with a very bad taste in their mouth. Many Turks that I know both in and outside of Turkey are warm and hospitable, but for one reason or another, the touristy environment in the center of Istanbul draws some of the worst individuals the world over to prey on foreigners. I was there for three days, and by the end I just did not know which mode of transport to take anymore because they are all terrible. The metro/tram lines, while clean & efficient, are littered with gangs who act despicable towards woman and foreigners, and child beggars whose parents are within eyesight ready to take any money earned. After a couple annoying experiences with these types on public transit, we opted for a cab to Taksim Square. Bad idea. The driver informed us that there were riots and army activity in Taksim square and thus he could not take us. He proceeded to basically do circles around the city. We pleaded for him to stop and to just let us out but he declined because he claimed it was not safe for us (it was Istiklal street, one of the busiest and safest streets to be on). Finally after much pleading he dropped us off nowhere near the square. So me, anxious to see the riot, made my way towards Taksim square only to arrive at an empty square with zero signs of a protest or riot ever having taken place. It was only then that I realized the extent of the taxi drivers scam. I understand taxis are scammers all over the world, but this guy literally would not stop the cab to let us out essentially claiming that we'd be shot. This left us with only one other transport option, ferries, since car renting is out of the question. We were told Beyoglu wouldnt be as bad as Sulthamhet, that wasn't the case as Beyoglu was less crowded and thus offered a better opportunity for thieves. Istanbul really takes scamming to a new level"

The Grand Bazaar alone, is a neighborhood of stores comprising in its totality, one of the greatest stores on earth.The history of the Ottoman Empire is fascinating to say the least. This city has had at least four names including Constantinople. Another...Byzantium.Constantine has a history here. So does Alexander the Great. A bridge carries you from Asia to Europe in two minutes. It is without a doubt one of the greatest cities in the history of the world. Three thousandMosques.In one city!

I tried to withdraw some Turkish Lira by using one of the ATM outside the YAPI KREDI BANK, Divon Yolu Caddes (Street), Sultanahmet on 14 Jun 2015. I inserted my bank card into the teller machine but it some how got stuck half way in the slot. I withdrew it and tried to reinsert my bank card into the slot again. Suddendly one young man stand behind me and help me by holding on one side of the bank card and together with me holding on one side of the card and pushed the bank card into the slot again. I noticed the card have fully inserted and I then key in my pin number following the prompt on the screen. After I have key in the pin number, nothing seem to happen on the screen. I did not even key in the amount I wish to draw. I waited for about one minutes, nothing happened. I pressed the \"cancell\" button on the key pad in an attempt to retrieve the bank card. I waited for a while, but nothing happened. I waited beside the ATM machine for the bank card to come out from the slot. While waiting I received SMS from my mobile phone that someone have made withdrawal of 2,000.00 LIRA from my account. one minutes later, another withdrawal was made on my bank account for another 1400.00 LIRA. In total 4000.00 LIRA was withdrawn from my bank account within 4 minutes before I managed to call desparetely to my bank to terminate my bank account.Lesson learnt. 1. Try to carry enough cash in US $ or Euros and change to LIRA if you need some small notes in LIRA to use in Turkey. 2. Please do not use the ATM in Istanbul. I believed many of the machines in Istanbul have been tampered with. Scanner or pinhole camera installed to steal card information. 3. If you need to draw cash. Do it inside their Airport ATM. Safer because of the high human traffic and the ATM less likely to be tampered with. 4. Make sure no one stand beside you or behind you all the time while you are making the cash withdrawal. Cover the key pad with you palm while keying in your pin number. Walk away if suddenly there is someone standing behind you. 5. Never, Never let any one touch your bank card.I am in the state of shock and disbelieve. How the hell there are the criminals) are able to pull this off within minutes? Anyone have similar experience? Anyone can provide any logical explanation? All are welcome. Thanks. NT. I tried twice to make a Police Report at Istanbul.

Istanbul is a far East as my wife and I had ever been and but even after we had decided to go, based on the concentration of sites to see, we were a bit apprehensive about getting around and handling transactions in a city of 17 million where Islam was the state religion. However, none of these concerns posed any problem: Istanbul has a world class, fully integrated, easy to navigate transportation system. Everyone spoke English. Hospitality everywhere was striking. The city was very clean, seemed very safe everywhere we went. And, to be sure the call to prayer, starting loud and clear every day took some getting used to but Islam and Christianity seemed to coexist remarkably well."

As two women, we felt very safe but did use a car service to go to restaurants after dark. There are numerous outdoor restaurants. Don't be put off by the persistent hosts who stand outside calling you, encouraging you to come in their establishment. Almost everyone speaks some English and always offered assistance for directions, etc. We were never disappointed by the food in any restaurant but service is slow by U.S. Standards. They want you to enjoy a leisurely meal. There were a lot of tourists and of course lots of touristy shops. The Spice Bazar was amazing to look at but prices are cheaper in small shops on the side streets. The Blue Mosque was beautiful but remember to bring a head scarf and avoid sleeveless shirts, shorts or short skirts. If you are, they will provide you with a a drape but I heard people complain they were dirty. Beware of anyone offering to be a tour guide and take you through the line ahead of everyone. They will charge a lot after a very brief, worthless tour. Hagu Sophia is gorgeous but our favorite historic site was the Topaki palace. Go in the morning to avoid long lines. One can enjoy all of the sites without going on a tour. We navigated around this area without any difficulty."

We visited the usual places - Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, Grand Bazaar and the Spice Markets - all very worthwhile. We travellled across the Bosphorus and walked around a little on the Eastern side. We then travelled back to Taxim Square and meandered down the main shopping street full of well known clothing brands and more sophisticated clothing shops. Our very convenient Hotel Fehmibey was not far from the main attractions and we found some delightful shops and many excellent and reasonable restaurants within walking distance. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our time in Istanbul but would love to have had more time to explore 'greater Istanbul' with its population of 14+million."

Here's a simple way to picture the city and get some sence of where things are, Take your left hand, hold it in front of your eyes, palm facing you. Your forefinger is the Bosporus and your finger nail is at the entrance to the Black Sea. Your thumb is the Golden Horn, which is an inlet of the Bosporus which itself is a strait \u2013 not a river. Where the bottom of your hand joins your wrist is the Sea of Marmara which eventually joins with the Aegean and Mediterranean seas via the Dardanelles, another strait (which would be along the bottom of your wrist). Your other three fingers are the Asia side of Istanbul and the base of your thumb is Sultanahmet. Today, this is the \u201cold town\u201d where the Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace are located and is small and easily walkable between sights. Hundreds of years ago, this area was the whole walled city of Constantinople. The \u201cnew city\u201d is above the web of your thumb, forefinger. Getting around is easy. Taxis are everywhere (make sure it\u2019s a yellow cab) the fare is usually shown on the drivers rearview mirror and they are very reasonable; ferries run up, down and across the water; and buses, trams, subways all interconnect, you can get a special transit card (check out the Istanbulkart, if you plan to use public transit a lot). If you are close to the old town, walking is the best option, and if you arrive by cruise ship, its maybe a 20-30 minute walk into the center across the Galata Bridge which will bring you to the Spice market. There are also trams right by the cruise ship dock and the Big Bus hop on, off stops there as well. it is a truly amazing city, the people are very hospitable, great hstorical sites to visit and excellent food"

Unlike other Islamic countries, the mosques are open to the non-Islamic public (and usually supply \"suitable\" clothing), and, many of them having been converted from Greek Orthodox churches, have their own images. A grand grand city to walk in. savoring surprises on both sides of the Bosphorus. Hint: Read your history before arriving!!"

But regard to time limitation, the best and most excited palace is Dolmabache palace that is located in Asian part of Istanbul.your visit prolonged about 2 hours but your time is unforgettable time. in comparison to Topcapy palace , Dolmabache palace is more interesting palace. in the other hand, there are many old and beautiful Mosque in Istanbul, i believed Sultan Ahmad Mosque is most beautiful in comparison to others like Aya Sophia Mosque. but these two palaces are just near together."

At places like this, you feel the world is a small place indeed- no matter your caste, creed, religion or colour- you will utter the same aaaaah when you behold this spectacle the first time.

The Grand Bazaar was not my favorite because it was so crowded. I discovered smaller ones and did my shopping there. The smells draw you into the Spice Market, but I thought, the spices were overpriced. There are a lot of beggars, especially with all the refugees coming across the border now. Beware of the shoe brush trick. Do not pick it up when dropped. It is a scam. We were warned before our trip. All in all, the Historic City is a magical place not to be missed.

Although I tend to escape from very turistic areas in favour of more authentic, local experiences, the old Constantinople obviously cannot be missed while in Istanbul. I visited the usual suspects so I will only highlight my favourites. I particularly loved Topkapi Palace and the Basilica Cistern. The former because I love Turkish mosaics and there are loads of them at the palace. Try not to miss the Harem. The Basilica Cistern is a magical place, just opposite the Hagia Sophia, it is a short visit, it takes no more than 20 minutes but there is something about it, the damp atmosphere, the columns, very peaceful (was not crowed at all when I visited it). Having seen souks and old markets before (in Morocco and Turkey), I found the Grand Bazaar and the Spice market were somewhat disappointing, but I guess if it is your first time you will find it exotic enough. There are some lovely, quite streets if you forget the map and just wander around. The area around Galata tower is lovely in the evening, with small shops and cafes open till late. I was on my own and felt very safe."

Topkapi is also a must visit but i suggest you get there early.Must see places!"

It is very crowded and carrying water supplies was essential to us. The Blue Mosque is nice but not beautiful in my opinion.The Topakapi is about the same. Sofia has more appeal!BIG Tip--Expect to have long lines unless you can arrange a tour to get you to the front of the line. Our Celebrity cruise tour did not do this for us and this was a major disappointment. It is very hot in Istanbul and outside exposure waiting in a line is unpleasant. Carry ample supplies of water!"

One of the best parts of Topkapi Palace is the Harem but it is has a separate entrance fee. Definitely pay the extra to see it.We bought the 3 day pass for the Topkapi Palace and other museums and it made it much simpler not to stand in so many long lines. Unfortunately though, we made the mistake of thinking it was an unlimited pass and we left Topkapi mid day to go rest. We thought we could return in the afternoon to finish our sight seeing. Unfortunately, the pass is only good for one visit per museum so no matter how tired you are, you need to finish the tour. Also, there are lots of hawkers that pretend they are tourists or regular locals and just want to talk to you, but they will always eventually lead you somewhere to sell you something. This is on top of the regular hawkers standing in front of stores and restaurants. It gets very tiring being constantly badgered.Overall it was an amazing trip with so much to see. We stayed 4 days but really needed more time to see the rest of Istanbul."

The Historic Areas of Istanbul are strategically located on the Bosphorus peninsula between the Balkans and Anatolia, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, Istanbul was successively the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Ottoman Empire and has been associated with major events in political history, religious history and art history for more than 2,000 years. The city is situated on a peninsula which is surrounded by the Golden Horn (Hali\u00e7), a natural harbor on the north, the Bosphorus on the east and the Marmara Sea on the south. The Historic Peninsula, on which the former Byzantium and Constantinople developed, was surrounded by ancient walls, built initially by Theodosius in the early fifth century. Some of the building around are:Hagia Sophia ,Topkapi Palace the S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque complex and Sehzade Mosque complex, works of the chief architect Sinan, reflecting the climax of Ottoman architecture in the 16th century, the 17th century Blue Mosque and the slender minarets of the New Mosque near the port completed in 1664.The four areas of the property are the Archaeological Park, at the tip of the Historic peninsula; the Suleymaniye quarter with Suleymaniye Mosque complex, bazaars and vernacular settlement around it; the Zeyrek area of settlement around the Zeyrek Mosque (the former church of the Pantocrator), and the area along both sides of the Theodosian land walls including remains of the former Blachernae Palace. These areas display architectural achievements of successive imperial periods also including the 17th century Blue Mosque, the Sokollu Mehmet Pasha Mosque, the 16th century \u015eehzade Mosque complex, the 15th century Topkapi Palace, the hippodrome of Constantine, the aqueduct of Valens, the Justinian churches of Hagia Sophia, St. Irene, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Ayasofya Mosque (the former church of the Sts Sergius and Bacchus), the Pantocrator Monastery founded under John II Comnene by Empress Irene; the former Church of the Holy Saviour of Chora with its mosaics and paintings dating from the 14th and 15th centuries; and many other exceptional examples of various building types including baths, cisterns, and tombs.A must!!!"

            "review": "A wonderful experience. My wife and I (I am 73 and my wife is 68) spent two and one-half days in Istanbul starting May 17, 2015. I had hired a private guide, Mehmet Tetik (guideturk@gmail.com) for two days. I had hoped to see the basic sites in the old town, but with Mehmet's guidance, we saw so much more. We basically were able to spend as much time as we wanted in all of the sites in the Sultanahmet (old town) on the first day, including Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, lunch at the famous pudding ship, Byzantine Hippodrome, and the Basilica Cistern. On the second day we went to the Grand Bazaar, the western wall, the Chora Church, the spice market and the New Mosque with a ferry ride on the Bospherous where we had lunch in a very nice restaurant on the Asian side. Istanbul is becoming a very popular tourist location, but we never felt it was over crowded (except in the Spice Market because we were there late in the day) and most of the tourists are from Islamic countries. We never felt unsafe, even though we took the street car once and the subway under the Bospheous back to the European side after lunch. We stayed in a hotel I found here on Trip Advisor, the Black Tulip, which is just five minutes from the Topkai Palace in the Sultanahmet. The hotel has all the lastest electronics, including electronic door locks, that with a screen outside our room with the room number and whether you are occupying the room or not. The rooms were immaculate, with marble baths, a big shower (large enough for two), and very comfortable beds. The staff was more than helpful. The breakfasts are lavish with multiple items, including some western items. We ate the Turkish breakfasts, which consist mostly of fresh vegetables. We took a cab from the airport to the hotel, which took about an hour, partly because it was a Sunday and you travel along the Sea of Marma, and there is a park all along the shore, and everyone was out having picnics parking their cars in the street, etc. It only cost about $12 though. You will love Istanbul, and if you are thinking of going, think about hiring Mehmet as your guide, you will not regret doing so. He is empathetic, college educated, speaks excellent American English, and has a depth of knowledge you will not get any other way."

When just sitting at the square you will have amazing view of the Blue mosque (Sultanahmet mosque) on one side and Hagia Sophia on the other side. You definitely should visit both since those are symbols of Istanbul. Next to the Blue mosque is Arasta bazaar and although it is pricey, especially if you are on the budget it is nice to walk around. My favorite part there are drains that are decorated with Turkish design tiles. Really cute. If you continue walking from there to Hagia Sophia on a right side you will come across old wooden houses that are not well maintained but are still beautiful and worth seeing. I recommend visiting Topkapi palace and plan to spend up to 6 hours there. It is worth spending most of your day there. There is so much to see, you can sit and enjoy the view using outside benches, gorgeous view on the sea, several cafes to get coffee and snacks. Gulhane park is just outside of Topkapi palace and it is good place to walk around, sit and read book and just meditate for hours. You can buy also snacks there and drinks. Close to the tramp stop Sultanahmet are located Basilica Cisterns. Definitely visit them. It gives completely different feeling of historic part of Istanbul. If you walk further up the tram line you will run across Grand Bazaar (Kapali carsii) and you will be able to get trinkets or simply enjoy this place. From there you can walk directly to the Suleymania mosque which is gorgeous. There are so many things to see just in this part of Istanbul and to keep you busy at least for several days. My favorite was sitting in the Sultanahmet square and having Turkish tea. Try it :)"

The thing I love about it is that it's just that bit different from most European life, to feel as though you have discovered something specia and a little differentl. I love the old world feel of some parts of the town. The steep winding roads and paths and the markets.Food is very good and the city is so much cleaner now than it was when I first visited way back. There is plenty of history and architecture to discover here too. People are no longer permitted to nag you to death to buy their goods so it is comfortable to just browse in shops. Hagai Sophia is a must to visit. The scale of the ceilings etc.are hard to grasp. We stayed a week and ran out of time to do everything, which was a shame, but on the last day we managed to spend some time chatting with a young local lad about photography, as he had bought his first decent camera with is hard earned cash. He invited us to join him for coffee but we were all out of time. Those moments are precious and I regret that we couldn't chat about how life was for him In such an interesting city."

The shops are excellent, value wise and for choice, be prepared to spend spend. The grand bazaar is a whole days outing and again spend spend, deals are to be had and the people are very helpful, just make sure you know what you want and stick to it, even after many cups of tea/coffee. It is exhausting doing tours, lots of walking on uneven pavements and lots of hills but so worth it, make sure you have a central hotel for rest time.

All those books won't help when compared to what you can know by visiting these places. Our favorite was the Topkapi palace though. My two cents, don't buy anything from the museum shops. Instead go to the shops along the road from Blue Mosque to Eminonu, they're great value and with little eye for detail and bargain you can get good stuff."

Be careful of what you buy - everything looks wonderful, from jewelry to carpets but it is hard to know who you can trust and if certificates of authenticity are really true. Especially be careful of shops selling the Turkish mined semi-precious gem stone Sultanate. Most of it is artificial - especially the larger stones - if they were real the price would be in the thousands of dollars!!Despite this, Istanbul is wonderful - try to fit in a Bosphorus cruise to see the skyline at its best"

It is still standing for the last 1478 years to recieve throngs of visitors from every corner of the world. 2- Similarly, Sultanahmet (Blue Mosque), as the Imperial mosque from 1935 to onward received the worshiper until it was declared to be a Museum. Almost for over 400 years these two Monuments have enjoyed the highest attraction. There are very important Christian period frescos on the second floor, don't miss it.3-Topkapi Palace Palace, the Harem and Gulhane Gardens are also a great attractions in this area as well as a few other mosques and the Mueum of Islamic History around.4- Sultanahmet park is full of historical places to draw crowds and"

I learnt nothing about the history of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire at school, but as soon as I started reading about it as an adult I was fascinated, so I just had to go and see Istanbul for myself. I looked at organised trips to Turkey but found it impossible to choose between them, so I decided i should book a city break to Istanbul and see the things that were important to me. I spent 2 full days exploring Sultanahmet, the old city area of Istanbul and had a wonderful, unforgettable, time. I don't speak Turkish so I booked 3 guided tours. I have no regrets about this, my guides were all excellent, really knew their subjects and added to the experience, but it wasn't necessary; around Sultanahmet most people spoke fluent English, and all were friendly and patient, so language wasn't a problem.Having visited the sites that I was curious about I am really looking forward to a longer trip to see more of Turkey once I have learnt a bit of the language"

Due to a mistake on my part, my husband's arrival in Istanbul was delayed by 4 full days. I explained to Sibel that this was entirely my fault and we understood that we would simply have to begin our tour where it was scheduled to be upon his arrival. Sibel was adamant in coming to the hotel to see me and determine the best way forward- she worked with the tour company, Meander Tours, and managed to minimize my self-inflicted damage to a loss of 1 day. Unbelievable. She also was determined that my unexpected extra days in Istanbul while waiting for my husband were not wasted. I cannot say enough good things about her.

The national flower of Turkey. It is represented everywhere, in the carpets in the mosques, on the ceramic plates you might like to purchase, on stained glass windows. The access road into the city was a blaze of colour, the leaves on the trees were barely out but the flowers were gorgeous. We drove under the Roman Aqueduct and along by Roman walls into the heart of the old city to Sura Design Hotel. Perfect location for the walking tour of the old city. Typhoon Yalcin a well respected guide of over 20 years, with a degree in both ancient & modern history had us wishing we had learnt a lot more history at school !!. We began at the huge Eygptian Obelisk that Constantine shipped in to Constantinople, the then Eastern capital of the Roman Empire. The column was placed at one end of the Hippodrome where thousands of spectators would watch chariot races and events from the stands which we saw remains of in the newly upgraded museum off to one side of the Hippodrome. Hagia Sophia is quite outstanding. It is huge & spectacular, now a museum, after first being built as a Byzantine Cathedral & then the Ottoman Sultan converted it to an imperial mosque. One must absolutely see this while in Istanbul, but you need your guide. The Blue Mosque is beautiful with its wonderful blue tiles covering the walls, blue stained glass windows, blue painted ceilings & 6 minarets. It is a fully functioning mosque so take your head scarf & don't wear shorts. We then visited Topkapi Palace. You experience the opulence of the Ottoman Empire & the Sultans' way of life. Overlooking the Bosphorus, surrounded by lovely gardens. Make sure you see the huge Topkapi Emerald and the Topkapi dagger. The crowds are big so just pick out the must see bits. We then went to the Basilica Cistern the largest of many ancient cisterns beneath the streets of Istanbul.where the Romans gathered and stored water keeping it safe from possible sabotage.Typhoon help me out. Who was the marble goddess ?? Time for a break !! The next day we explored the Grand Bazaar, & the Spice Market, where merchants culminated after trekking the Silk Road to trade and do business. Getting lost is not a problem you will come out at some point with a stack of purchases, if your not careful. The Turkish Delight is fantastic. Also amazing is the Chora Church, the early Christian Frescos are just fantastic. The new mosque Suleymaniye was built to be bigger and better than the Blue Mosque. Is it ? Not so sure. Make sure you take the cruise on the Bosphorus. It makes you aware of how strategic the Marmaris Sea, the Bosphorus & the Black Sea are to the trade links through to Russia, the West and the East.We walked into Taksim Square the social and cultural hub, where the people of the city demonstrated against the building of another supermarket to replace their green space in 2013 There are very few green spaces in the inner city. One beautiful park is Camlica Hill. It was packed with young families the day we were there. Have a Turkish tea near the old teahouse.Along from Taksim Square we walked Istiklal Street. Am I right Typhoon?? 4 million people walk this street on a daily basis. It is so hard for us to comprehend when we have 4 million people in total in New Zealand. Our lunch was at the Karakoy Wharf Fish market. Wow the best fish. Dining at night.Try Ataturks favourite restaurant in Sisli and if you have not tried Raki then do, it is and acquired but great drink, just don't mix it with wine or to many beers. We had 4 days in Istanbul in total. We would have liked more."

In no other city the history is as livid as Istanbul; originally a Greek Colony to site of mighty Byzantine Empire giving way to the great Ottoman Dynasty and now major city of Turkish republic.Simply awed to see a 1500 BC obelisk at Hippodrome, transported from ancient Egypt. It was erected here by Byzantine emperor Constantinius I(337-361 AD). Close by is imposing Hagia Sophia. Not only structurally imposing, its history is equally mesmerizing- served as church for over 900 years and as mosque for nearly 500 years under Ottoman rule. Now a museum. Just at the opposite end is the mammoth Blue Mosque. Besides these , the city is replete with many other monuments,palaces depicting twists and turns of history the city witnessed.To cap it all the fun and frolic the city offers are class in itself - dinner cruise along Bosporus strait,accompanied by ethenic dances; diverse cuisines of city restaurants, stroll around Grand Bazaar and Spice markets are other unforgettable experience."

For those who don\u2019t know, Istanbul is a very eclectic city and a pure oriental megalopolis. One can see here a great modern architecture building, next to a very old historical building, or to an ancient wood American old house style, or a skyscraper there and just few meters faraway a poor family barrack next to it, all in a mixture of pure occidental cleanness in front of a 5* international brand hotel, followed by pure oriental dirt and bad smell on the same trotuary just few meters away.But this makes Istanbul so flavoring and special.Also, is good to know that when the ancestors of the nowadays Turkey, the Ottomans, who were nomads with roots on the Mongolian areal, came to the place where todays lays Istanbul, they found the byzantine civilization\u2019s capital \u2013 the Constantinopole, or Constantinopolis \u2013 which was so beautiful and so well laid down on the Bosporus shore as they immediately put in mind to conquer it. And they siege it and later they conquer it, finally.All so many beautiful architecture pieces the Ottomans kept it and they just turn it into their own view of Muslim changes, as it happened for instance with the Hagia Sofia orthodox cathedral which was turned into a mosque and later, nowadays into a museum.Many old byzantine are so valuable for the Turkish tourism, but in fact it has nothing to do with their own culture or is not their merit. Like the Cistern, like the city walls and old towers, like the very old citadels and so on and so forth.It makes great sense to visit the old Istanbul including the Bazaar, including the Topkapi, the sultanate palace, which in fact is not that fancy, thinking that it was for the sultans of the Ottoman Empire, but at least the Topkapi treasury museum worth the ticket, in my opinion.The Bazaar, seen from the constructional perspective it\u2019s pretty unique and the content makes it in fact quite attractive to see it, at least once in a life time.I advise not to choose a hotel in the old Istanbul. They are small, cheap and not good in what it means good in the rest of Europe. Better a good hotel in the new Istanbul and drive by taxi.I recommend a Bosporus boat trip too, and one can have the chance to see many of the historical places on the long shore just enjoying the boat trip under the famous bridges too.It worth to visit the Orthodox Ecumenical Church and residential palace too \u2013 they long as the Byzantine time too.

Dress code is enforced, you will need to be covered, they do provide scarfs at the entrance. Once inside will take you 10-15 tops to take photos and absorb the atmosphere. Worth visiting the area at night to take some nighttime snaps. This is adjacent to the Hagia Sophia."

The day I spent there I was accompanied by what seemed like a million other tourists as there were 3 large cruise ships in port, but somehow this added to the frenetic fun of just being there. I felt totally safe even though you might find yourself fending off a vendor of some sort. I only wish I had several days to spend in this area."

From the Hop On Hop Off Bus that we used to acclimate ourselves to the layout of Istanbul, to the sites we visited while there, one cannot express how vital these sites are to the history and culture of this window to the world in it's day! All the main sites are a must on your bucket list: Hagia Sophia, Topkaki Palace, Blue Mosque, the Bazzar,etc. but take the time to ride the tram that goes through the other areas of the city. Walk around Sultanahmet Square in the evening when the lights are on and experience the wonder of these sites with their beautiful architecture lit up to take your breath away. Experience a little store that is in a neighborhood right under a townhouse where it is so small you can't turn around but the proprietor is just so friendly and helpful (I had symptoms of bronchitis and it was a holiday where everything was closed; this little store was open and the owner gave me cinnamon in a bag to put in my tea to relieve symptoms and would not charge me! It was a lifesaver!!! The side streets held beautiful pashminas that were fairly priced and became treasures. The restaurants on the side streets were frequented by the natives and we LOVED the intimacy of the setting and friendliness of the patrons and wait staff.

We wanted to see the Hippodrome, the Blue Mosque, the Sarnici (cistern), the Topkapi Palace and the wonderful Aya Sofya Byzantine church/mosque, now a museum. We quickly saw that half the world wanted to be there too. Masses of coaches jammed the streets daily from early morning. Swarms of tourists in convoys meant seriously long queues to get in anywhere. Once in, you had keep your wits about you dodging the cameras waving in the air at the end of selfie sticks - the most annoying must-have accessory of the season. But if you don't want to spend your holiday standing for hours in queues, buy an Istanbulkart (excellent value with easy topping up at touch screen machines or kiosks) and take a tram or a bus or a ferry to the outskirts. There the crowds will be fewer, the restaurants cheaper and the air in cleaner. The 38 bus from central Eminonu will take you to the Kariye Museum in Chora where you can see the most magnificent frescos and mosaics, superbly preserved. Or take the 99a bus to Balat and wend your way uphill to the museum through narrow, cobbled streets lined with prettily painted wooden houses. Stay on the 99a bus to the Pierre Lotte cafe and take a ride on the new cable car, only 2.15TL (about 50p) with the Istanbulkart. From the top you'll have a breathtaking view of the city and the Golden Horn. Away from the multi-national tourists and their selfie-sticks, you'll be charmed by the real locals. And you wont be hassled to buy a carpet!"

If you don't have the time and want to see the major tourism sites in Istanbul, you can do it in two days, however, you will be tired, and you will have missed many, many sites of this amazing city. Although I am staying for several days, I decided today to visit the major tourism destinations in Istanbul on foot: the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the Blue Mosque), the Hagia Sophia Museum, the Basilica Cistern, and the Topkapi Palace Museum. After reviewing my day, I would have to conclude that although these sites are all within walking distances from each other, seeing all of them in one day was a bit much. In hindsight, the visits through the Blue Mosque and the Basilica Cistern where relatively short, and I realized that I should have done more research on the Blue Mosque (there is very little interpretation on this magnificent building), and gave myself more time at the Topkapi Palace Museum."

BTW, the actual race course is many meters below the current pavement. In fact, where else could a riot have led to 30,000 killed and half of Constantinople burned down? How are the so-called Nika Riots related to Nike, the Goddess of Victory? And now, more significantly to us tourists, how did this lead to the building of Haghia Sophia? terraencounters.blogspot.com"

In fact it is somewhat meaningless.Firstly there are three places basically every tourist is going to want to see and all three would rate five stars in their own right: The Blue Mosque, The Aya Sofia and the Topkapi Palace. Now they are all in very close proximity. The second tier of places to visit would probably comprise the Turkish & Islamic Museum, the Basilica Cistern and the Archaeological Museums. Probably with a stroll through Gulhane Park as an addenda to the latter. And you'd check out the Hippodrome as part of your walking about doing that lot.Third tier stuff might include checking out a nearby bazaar or even the Museum of Science & Technology in Islam which is at Gulhane Park.And that's before you strolled over (or walked to) the Grand Bazaar, thence to the Spice Bazaar and then on to New Mosque and the Eminono area. And if you have the energy for one more big ticket item head up to Suleymaniye Mosque (spelling?).All up without even crossing over the Galata Bridge and to the tower of the same name in the Golden Horn area you could easily spend three days checking out the 'Historic Areas of Istanbul' and that's before you head farther afield to the Chora Church or the Walls of Constantinople.Look.... seriously just go there.

Be prepared for narrow streets, busy thoroughfares, uneven footpaths/roads and very little lights for traffic control. We familiarised ourselves with the public transport system (trains, trams, ferries) and we used these to get between points. Place names are in Turkish and not Arabic, so they are easy to read and say (with a little practice). There is a travel card requiring up front payment which covers all public transport and can be used for 2 people (our hotel had one immediately available).. Most trips are 2TL but if you pay at the turnstile it will cost you 4 TL. So there is an immediate 50% saving there for each trip.. There is a hop on and hop off bus service but when roads become congested (noon to 3pm, or soccer events) travelling time can blow out significantly.Like most Cities, Istanbul has those who like to take advantage of the tourist. Briefly these are - taxi drivers taking longer routes to destinations ( take a GPS map and track your route)......local tap water isn't safe but don't buy bottled water from roadside sellers..... buy a museum pass, this will get you into a number of major sites without queuing (our hotel had them available)........always be prepared to negotiate a purchase from about 50% of starting price....there are beggars who'll follow you everywhere if you give anything...... don't be conned into a picture with dressed up locals who say there is a fee once the photo is take........ for major attractions get an entry ticket the day before and go at least 30 minutes before opening time."

We last visited in 1995 and the change is amazing. There is so much to see that I guess most people just go to the main places, Topkapi, Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque being the principle ones. But the Archealogical Museums , including the Tile Kiosk are wonderfull and worth a whole day to themselves. There are smaller museums like the Mosaics in the Bazaar near the Blue Mosque. And the shops are fascinating too.If you want a tour company for a guide, or a Bospheros tour by boat I recommend KARAVAN Tourizm Sey, especially Sekim who made us laugh as well as being informative.

The token machine are ALWAYS surrounded by gypsies and beggers wanting money making traveling on public transport relatively expensive and inconvenient without a metro card.You don't need to buy multiple cards either, if your travelling in a group you can just pass the card back over the turnstiles to your travelling companion(s) and the card can be swipped again for the next person.These cards can also be used to access council owned toilets (WC) all toilet access is charged at 1 TRY and This card was quite handy when I didn't have change."

Its a delightful small station with an original roof supported by three graceful rows of cast-iron columns that follow the curve of the platform. Our locomotive squeels to a halt, face to face with the man who created modern Turkey, whose gold painted head protrudes from a stone plinth inside the station, with his long straight nose and beetle-browed stare. He looks vaguely sinister, like magician. We leave the station down a flight of marble stairs and into Istanbul. The city doesn't immediately work its magic but one cannot fail to notice that nowhere do history and geography merge more spectacularly as they do here. Its an amazing location, at the end of Europe and the beginning of Asia, where the Mediterranean meets the Black Sea. Its really eye stopping to think, what city can heighten ordinary experiences, views, more dramatic departures and arrivals, more significant encounters, more promising awareness sharper?  Istanbul always makes us feel as a city with a foothold in two distinct worlds and i can't imagine it jumping completely onto one side or the other. We set out across the Galate Bridge, our backs to the great Ottoman and Byzantine monuments, heading up to Pera, once a colony of Genovese merchants. Fishermen line the bridge and flat-topped water-taxis slide beneath with only centimetres to spare.  Everywhere, huge posters quoting Ataturk with strident reiterations of Republican ideals. It seems to suggest that the populace needs reminding of them constantly. I wonder if they are under threat? Everyday we discover something new in Istanbul. We took the ferry into Asia and up into one of the many suburbs fanning out over the exposed hillsides on the eastern bank of the Bosphorus. I must say this is a new Istanbul without decay but also without character where everything is fresh out of the box. A boat up the European shore sharpens our senses while we scan the coast for the fast disappearing Yalis, the elaborately stylish timber houses built as water-front retreats for the city's prominant families. They reminded me of houseboats in Cashmire, delicately beautiful, made for pleasure not for permanence.  We dined on a plate full of kidney beans, ratatouille, red peppers, beetroot and a glass of aniseed-flavoured Raki. Salute Istanbul"

We also visited the Basilica Cisterns which were fantastic - all within short strolls of each other. By getting out from our apartment early, we could beat the tourist crush and see these magnificent sights peacefully.Over in Beyoglu, we stayed in flats not far away from the main drag, but amongst intriguing laneways and streets filled with local eateries and antique shops. So atmospheric. The Main Street was quiet in morning times, but filled with the masses from 12 pm onwards, thriving to street music, food and ice cream vendors and locals going about their daily business. Great stuff. Side lanes held eateries, rooftop and terrace bars, fish markets and traditional Turkish taverns with shishas and live music aplenty. Enough to keep even the most jaded traveller entertained.To top all of this, we also enjoyed a day long Bosphorous Cruise - standard non-private tour option. Was fantastic to get as far as the entrance to the Black Sea and lunch in tiny village, before returning. A great day out. Istanbul - you are an amazing, thriving city filled with lovely people.

Lots of street vendors trying to sell you just about anything. A polite brush off would usually get rid of them. Public restrooms often required 1 Tl so be prepared."

The highlights of the trip was exploring historic Istanbul, seeing the ancient city of Ephesus (optional tour), dipping my feet in the natural hot springs of Pamukkale, and visiting the underground city and rock formations of Cappadocia (optional tour). Some other highlights were leisurely spending part of the day in the resort town of Ku\u015fadasi along the Aegean Sea, visiting an elementary school, and going to a traditional Turkish bath. The hotels were all good to excellent and each had its own unique character. The meals included were also tasty and delicious. Overall, Gate 1 gave me terrific value for my trip to Turkey."

The people are very friendly, and although there are people who hassle you to buy things, it was no worse than many other parts of the world. We felt safe at all times here, just take normal precautions you would in any city in the world. If you are a museum buff then buying a pass is a good idea. They used to be for 72 hrs, but are now for 5 days, so you can see sights at your leisure.

The main part where the mosques and palaces are is wonderful, but very crowded (especially on a weekend). The Grand Bazaar is here as is the Cistern, the old city walls and the old aquaducts. The other section of the historic area is across the Galata Bridge and is home to historic areas, but a lot more modern things. Be wary of the crowds and the little urchin children begging for money. The other thing to be careful about are the trams that have to ring their bells in order to get down the street, but are conviniently located to most of the major sites."

We really enjoyed our time there and seeing the Eastern architecture and culture. We stayed in the old city at the Hotel Niles which was great as it was so easy to get to the main attractions & restaurants. To get around we either walked or took the Tram system. Here is our itinerary: Evening 1: stroll around the Sultanahmet area and dinner; Day 2: Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sophia, Emin\u00f6n\u00fc area, Spice Bazaar, Grand Bazaar; Day 3: Topkapi palace, Gulthane Park, boat ride (ferry) on Bosporus; Day 4: Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Taksim, Shopping. Overall a very good trip and great experience, Temperatures in early April were mid teens, although it was rainy (the hotel lent out umbrellas or you can buy them for 10TL from street vendors). Easter is quite crowded as many in northern Europe get holidays then, but lines for the sights were not too bad... the maximum we queued was 30 minutes."

Read a good guide book of your choice in advance, keep it with you and prepare to walk, uphill, down hill on historic cobblestones till your feet go numb. Stop for tea at a cafe, sit in any park, listen, watch, breathe it all in. Every corner you turn, every turn of the head fills your senses with this great city. You know all the sights to see...and dont forget to get off the main streets, be it in the old town or new. If you can do anything on your 1 st nite try for a rooftop restaurant in Sultanamet near the water with views of the Blue Mosque & Aya Sofia. We tried Teras, a little pricey but not bad and OK food but OOOH the romance and view. We were there for 6 full days & I suggest no less to do an unhurried ability to savor. A fun place that is easy to bypass with all that history out there is the Istanbul Modern. Great for a bad weather day but forget the highly touted Cafe..This review I realize was put under the wrong category originally. Just copied it over now.Visited October 2011"

            "review": "Of Spices, carpets, bazaars and taxi drivers... The good, the great and the ugly. Let me say that Istanbul is a lovely city where the old meets new. I would like to review my experience 1. The good: the spice market is really a sight to behold especially if you are a foodie who cooks. I did my research so as not to be overwhelmed and get conned. Here are a few tips:  a. The most reliable whole seller is ARIFOGLU. If u go to supermarkets, u will see their products on the spice racks. b. Do not buy pre packed stuff.  C. Buy per gram and they will vacuum seal it for you.  D. BUy from inside the shop and not from outside on display e. Iranian. Saffron... This is the real deal. It comes in 3 jars from the most fragrant to the least, priced at 60, 40 and 20 TL per gram ! They will weight it infront of you and put them in small jars and vacuum seal it. The ones sold by others for Vy cheap are actually safflower as turkey does not produce saffron F. Buy dried fruits that are not cut up G. But shelled nuts as they are fresher H. Taste the Turkish delights before u buy themSit down and enjoy tea as they are doing your purchase, it's free because it is their custom to offer tea.2. The grand bazaar is really not worth buying from except for maybe leather, unless you want to be cheated and chased until u buy something. But if you do go, I recommend this guy near gate 2 called POSH bag, Mr Seckin Atag. He is the only one who will not force u and honestly tell u the faults and good about his products...they are good leathers. He will calmly let you go if u say u will be back and see other stores. He is a whole seller and people even imitate his imitation ! You can tell the leather is good.Other that leather...there is nothing else worth buying there. Also don't be fooled by people holding a lighter to the bag to prove its leathe.You will be better off with the Arastar bazaar beside the blue mosque which is smaller, less people harassing you3. The great: carpets and jewelry. THIs was a really good recommendation by our concierge from park hyatt (which is great by the way) as his only concern is that we find genuine turkish carpets and real jewelry and u won't be cheated.The carpet place is called Eginci and the jewelry store is Divas. They are both owned by 3 generations who know their craft. You won't find the finest silk carpets that u certainly know is genuin except here. Most will be claiming that it's turkish carpets, but really they are not. REal turkish carpets are expensive and if they bargain too low, be wary.omar, one of the owners speaks very good English and very knowledgeable.He will even show u how they make the carpets and once u see that most take about 1-2 years by hand, u know why the price is not possible to be cheap. They are also very pleasant to deal with. They. Will offer you a ride back whether ubuy or not if you come recommended by your concierge.3. THE UGLY: definitely the crupulous cab drivers. We foolishly rode a cab by the spice market, noticed something wrong with the meter that it is below, and he kept circling around. Then he made up an excuse to drop us off the corner from our hotel and pulled the \"cash switch\" ... I gave him 50 TL, because the fare was 43 TL (too expensive to begin with) then I saw him switch it with a 5TL and said I gave him only 5TL. I told him I saw him switch it but he insisted. Rather than get in trouble, we just paid and got out. So to avoid this, a few tips':a. Pick only cabs from your hotel or restaurantsB. If u have to get from the road, get the ones with cab logos on the door, not just the phone number c. The meter is digital and can be found on the rear view mirrord. Get the plate number of the cab and report it to your conciergeThe hotel we stayed on is fantastic...park hyatt and I will write a separate review."

A small group of us recently visited Istanbul for a three night break and it was probably one of the best city breaks we have done together, but in hindsight we should have made it a four or five night break as there is so much to see and do and you don't want to rush it. One of the main advantages is that most of the main attractions are located in or around the main square area in the old city, and they are easily within walking distance of one another. In fact if you stand in the main square you can see most of them.All the food we had during our stay was good, and its very reasonably priced too.The general advice, which I tend to agree with is to avoid travelling by taxi unless you want to get ripped off, and why would you want to go by taxi anyway when the trams are new, clean, reliable and cheap.We didn't see and graffiti and saw very little litter during our stay, which made the whole city seem clean. All the Turkish people we encountered during our stay were friendly and helpful.I also recommend a boat trip along the Bosphorus while you are there too, as you get to see both sides of the city from a different perspective.We pre-booked our transfers to and from the airport and our city hotel online before we flew, which proved to be a great idea. As the company were there to greet us as we came out of the airport and picked us up promptly from our hotel as arranged. All for 25 Euros per trip for four people. (we used Efendi Travel)"

I don't recommend going to the topkapi palace on day 1, due to time crunchDay 2: Start early at 9:00AM and cover topkapi palace (5 hrs) and a nice walk or take train to Grand Bazaar. Don't buy stuff here. It is atleast twice of what you can get for elsewhere. Definitely don't buy baklava and turkish delight here. It is not good quality here.At night visit Galata tower and walk along istiklal street all the way to Taksim square (2 hrs)Day 3: Go for Bosphorous trip (3 Hrs). There are multiple options. Take the one that takes you to nice palaces around and into black sea (3-4 hrs). They start close to Galata bridge. Upon completing this, walk along Galata bridge to the awesome experience and view of seeing Topkapi Palace, Aya Sofia, Blue mosque in one view. Note: For buying soveniers pashabashe in istiklal street is the best place. You can buy turkish delight for under 30lira at Haci Bekir (170yrs old shop). Best baklava in town is in Karakoy Gulloglu and Hafiz Mustafa. Buy some boreks (1-2 lira) or Simits if you want to munch on something every now and then"

This is a government that carried out a sadistic genoicide and today says it never happened, so go, enjoy the sites, but don't believe the guides. If you ask questions, they won't answer.

This is not a guide, just an account of our experiences that may be useful on your visit to a truly amazing city.Prayer Times- Plan your visits to key places around prayer times, as this is when it can be quieter, however when prayer is over things can get very, very busy.Haggle- It\u2019s not something us Brits are used to doing, but haggle, at first it feels weird but once you get going its quite fun. I found that when you ask a price, if you say nothing and walk away it shows your not interested, but if you respond with an offer this shows you want the item so the vendor will try to keep the sale. Start with offering a third of their original offer and work from there. Keep things fun, don't get too up tight but have in mind how much you\u2019re willing to pay.Grand Bazar- Is very bazar, this is a place I can guarantee you will get lost and feel like you are walking around in circles. This is part of the charm and experience of the bazar. It's a bit like a Chinese finger trap, best thing to do is stay calm, have a cup of tea, breathe and then plan your escape route. You may get it right, if not stop for another tea and a kebab.Clumsy Shoe Shiners- This is a comical scam and funny to watch. There are quite a few shoeshine people walking about. As they walk past you with their little shoeshine box out falls one of their brushes. Oh no I hear you cry! So you pick the brush up and call after the guy, who is apparently oblivious to dropping the brush and now owes his living to you for returning it. He simply must repay you by polishing your shoes, trainers, flip-flops or toenails. However you end up paying him for this service. Everyone has got to earn a living and they are great actors but just look out for it.\u201cI know you from the hotel\u201d- as we walked about we were approached by someone saying they knew us from the hotel, this caught us of guard and being British and not waiting to be rude we would talk with them, this would then lead to questions about what we were doing for the day and amazingly who ever we were talking to they had a shop we should visit. Everyone has a shop you should visit. My advice: take it or leave it but the line about knowing you from the hotel felt like a conversation starter.Confusing Sweets- if you find all the different types of baklava, Turkish delight, puddings, teas and coffees mind blowing the best place to go is Edebiyat Kiraathanesi. Located off the tram at Sultanamet it\u2019s on the main road just down from the tram stop. It is an amazing little place where you can sit down and you are given a menu that is like a catalogue with glossy pictures and descriptions of all 149 items they sell. Take your time and select one of two. This will not be the only time you visit this shop on your visit I guarantee it. Explore Everything- its tempting to stick to the touristy things in a city but I highly recommend the Two Continents Tour with My Local Guide Istanbul\u2026. This took us around some parts of Istanbul that we had not been too, we tasted food we would never have been aware of or been brave enough to order in a restaurant or from a food market. We heard stories that you can\u2019t find in the tour books and also tired the Hubbly Bubbly pipe in an authentic environment but with an excellent friendly guide. Well worth the price and only the price of a good meal out.Museum Pass- if you\u2019re planning on going to a few museums then buying a pass works out much cheaper, this gives you 72 hours access to lots of places but there are some exclusions. You can buy these from dedicated placed located around the main areas off the Hippodrome."

Most Turks can tell Americans from other tourist they say we are the ones who smile which I found to be true. The attractions are wonderful I think my word would be exotic.

This was Day 1 of an RBK coach holiday, and included lunch at a restaurant opposite the lower entrance to Topkapi Palace. There's very little chance to sit down and rest under shelter, when the weather is this bad - you just have to keep going! The more sheltered rooms of Topkapi were very full of tourists, but it was still a fascinating place. The treasures are awesome! If you're visiting the Blue Mosque, or indeed any mosques, make sure you're wearing shoes that are easy to get off and on again. The room for taking off shoes is very small and gets crowded, and people of limited mobility can be jostled. Once in the side-entry of the Blue Mosque there is no way to get out without going through the whole mosque, so be sure you want to go through the shoes-off, shoes-on again! Older people with limited mobility may find this difficult.Hagia Sofia is utterly gorgeous, a masterpiece of Byzantine glory, and the work to uncover and restore the original mosaics is most impressive. It is no longer a mosque or a church but a museum, and has very good historical presentations in the front corridor. There's even somewhere to sit! The cats are friendly as well. From previous visits I know the Museum at Topkapi Palace is well worth a visit - it was built to rival the British Museum, and in terms of public exhibition rooms it is certainly close in size. From Egyptian mummies to Assyrian tiled walls of winged lions, to ancient Sumerian cuneiform tablets, to a section of the original medieval chain that once closed off the Golden Horn to hostile ships - the amount and variety of the exhibits is stunning.By the time we'd slogged around Topkapi, Hagia Sofia and Blue Mosque the weather had deteriorated and only a few decided to brave the Egyptian Bazaar - doing all this on two hours' sleep wasn't a clever idea really."

We met the tour in front of the Blue Mosque. There are 3 historical building pretty close together. Exciting to see. I was so busy trying to get just the right picture, and not listening to my ear buds for the guide, that I was left behind. I found the tour people and they had a young man walk me to the Palace where my tour group was now located. I was never afraid nor felt alone. I am a single woman and was not with anyone on the tour.

People are very kind but sometimes too pushy. Public transport is working well. If you ignore the occasional smells of some passengers it's the most efficient way to travel to some locations, but you can visit most of them on foot cause they are grouped in specific areas. While planning your trip be sure to check when different sights are open to visitors because you can miss to see some of them if you are not there for a couple of days.

Buy souvenirs like fridge magnets, key hobs, blown glass etc. Dont forget to buy squeezed fresh juice from the stalls and anchovy fish everywhere!You can take a train, or a boat or a bus anywhere on the route for 1 jeton(4TL). No where is far in this area.if you can take the Bosphorus cruise: straddle 2 continents at the same time. i have been on both the full cruise which took all day from the European side to the Asian side. Only one boat company does the full cruise ill put up the name when i recall it and they have limited seats. But you have to join a queue and stand for hours, the cruise starts at 10am and takes about 3hrs to get to the other side. The boat docks for about 2 hours then another 3 hours back. My advice, take the half cruise its equally as beautiful and you wont get so exhausted.Dont leave istanbul without drinking turkish tea, having some turkish delight and taking a turkish bath.visit as many historic sights and mosques as you can, beautifully preserved over the centuries."

The public transport is easy to use and reliable. We came in February, we had some warm days, no coat needed, some very cold days, hats, scarves and gloves needed, and some rain, but we loved every minute of it. If you are in the Hagia Sofia/Blue Mosque area it can be a bit off putting with people asking to 'help you' all the time, or to show you their rug stores nearby, but a firm 'no thank you', or to just ignore is all it takes. We always felt safe. At this time of year we had no queues, anywhere. We tried many of the food outlets nearby and were not disappointed, whether for something to eat or just a refreshing cup of Turkish chay (cay). We stayed for 7 nights and would love to come back again one day, one of the best cities we have ever been to.

Expect it to be busy. You aren't the only visitors that want to experience these areas. Get a bit of the beaten path. We did quit by accident one day and found a wonderful experience of shops and locals. Do be prepared to walk some hills if you do this. Istanbul is not flat. Without venturing into the historic areas you will miss all of the major sites you probably went to Istanbul to see. The mass transit can be your friend. It is very easy to use and is tailor made for tourists. If you happen to be staying outside the historic area the trains and tram can save you some walking. Buy a card that you can keep adding money amounts to. This is the cheapest way to go if you use the transit more than just a couple of rides. Have fun and don't let the \"old\" scare you away."

            "review": "Treasure Trove of Sites. Istanbul's long history means myriad sites from the past that attract tourists. Sultanahmet -- the city's historic core -- brims with fascinating places to see. These include the Blue Mosque with its six minarets; Hagia Sophia, a Byzantine wonder; the eerily beautiful 6th-century Basilica Cistern; the Topkapi Palace; and the list goes on. Though I'm a history buff, I don't think one has to be in order to appreciate what attractions offer today in terms of architecture, religious significance, etc.Sultanahmet's historic sites seem to be on everyone's \"must see\" list so the lines can get long for admission. On our recent visit during the off-season, we noted a huge line for Hagia Sophia but walked right in for a repeat visit to the Basilica Cistern. When we've been here in the summer, though, extremely long lines appear everywhere. During that time, I was able to enter Hagia Sophia immediately by going as soon as it opened in the morning and essentially had the place to myself for about half an hour. I've seen all the sites so enjoy simply wandering around the clean, safe area, sometimes ducking into shops or going to one of the many cafes or restaurants.Because Istanbul is an old city -- kind of a living museum -- other districts also offer attractions of historic interest. For example, one of my favorites is the stunning Dolmabahce Palace, built in the 19th century during the Ottoman Empire. The palace stands by the water in the Besiktas District. I'm also attracted to the mosaics and frescoes in the Edirnekapi neighborhood's Byzantine Chora Church.For first-time visitors, I recommend a guide book and a look at Trip Advisor's list of Istanbul attractions. These will help narrow down what historic sites to see, based on interest and time available."

            "review": "A remarkable experience. My partner and I visited most of the must-see attractions on the European side of Istanbul during our week-long visit there. The city is very old indeed and has a wonderful mix of Eastern and Western cultures, making it truly one of a kind. It's definitely one of my favourite holiday destinations thus far, although it might be wiser to visit during spring time (March / April) as our experience has taught us that winter in Turkey can be rather unpredictable (sunshine one day, snow shower the next). The top attraction ought to be the Topkapi Palace (30 TL for general entry & another 15 TL for the Harem, where the more interesting rooms are located). If you're really keen on learning about the history of the palace, sign up for a guided tour (approximately 40 - 50 TL/person) which lasts about 1 h and 15 min. The tour guides are everywhere, so choose wisely. If you don't mind paying for a guided tour, the trick is to sign up at the very last minute so you can \"bargain\" yourself a deal as they're typically interested to get as many people as possible to join the group. Alternatively, you can always pay for an audio guide which costs 20 TL.Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque and Basilica Cistern are all quite interesting. When you're done walking around the city, do take the official Bosphorus ferry tour run by Sehir Hatlari. It's the cheapest option and definitely the most reliable one. A short cruise will only run on the weekends during winter time (up to mid-March) whereas a long cruise (~ 1.5 hour one way from Eminonu to A.Kavagi) leaves the pier at 10:35 on a daily basis (15 TL one way or 25 TL return). The ferry will dock at A. Kavagi (there\u2019s a fort that you can visit) for approximately 3 hours and you\u2019re free to roam around the fishing village (which has been described by some as a tourist trap). The journey from A.Kavagi to Eminonu departs at 15:15.We got off the ferry at Sariyer instead (second last stop) and wandered around the little town before taking a bus (#25E to Kabatas or #25T to Taksim Square) to get back Istanbul city centre. The whole bus journey takes about an hour or so, as it cruises along the coastal road picking up and dropping off passengers along the way. Only choose this option if you\u2019re in no hurry to get back to the city centre. In term of food, expect to pay around an average of 15 TL per dish if you\u2019re eating in a restaurant, or even a local eatery. Most of our meals cost between 45 to 60 TL for two people. It\u2019s not cheap but it\u2019s also pretty standard throughout the city. We ate at a local restaurant that\u2019s quite far from the city centre and thus, can be considered as \u201cnon touristy\u201d but still paid the same amount as we did around the tourist epicentre.  On a slightly negative note, be extra mindful of the countless opportunistic crooks scattered around the city. On our first evening there, we were approached by someone who pretended to be a tourist looking for directions while we were out on a stroll. He was obviously trying to get us to follow him to a random place in town for a \u201cfriendly\u201d but ultimately over-priced drink. Run a quick search and you\u2019ll be amazed by the range of tactics used by the unscrupulous individuals there. We\u2019ve travelled quite extensively but the petty crooks in Istanbul are by far the most aggressive. Hence, be vigilant if you\u2019re visiting for the first time. Our advice is to decline unwanted offers politely but be firm. They\u2019ll usually leave you alone if they sense that they aren\u2019t going to get anything from you."

Definitely go to the blue mosque, its a long wait, but its worth it, a little difficult to get to the upper floor, but the design is worth it, very plush, took lots if pictures. don't bother with the museum too much, unless ur a history fanatic, it jus had personal belongings of the sultan mehmet. It wasn't worth the line and 30lira for me, but you can get a fast past for later. Don't miss the map by the side of the road. its was known as the center of europe, Its kinda conspisous. unless you are really hungry, don't eat at the restaurant down the road from the mosque and museum. Ask your guide to take you to the local market, just a train ride from the museum. U can get authentic turkish food. The restaurants are pricey and doesn't really taste \"homemade\". Take time to visit the park by the museum, ideal for lovers who want a quiet spot to relax ;) ;). There's a military museum up the hill from the park, it gives you a gud spot to view the \"asian side\" of turkey from the \"European side\". You\"ll be at the \"European side\". Visit the local market, also a train ride from the blue mosque( don't buy anything unless you have a guide who'll bargain for you). but they have authentic turkish scarves and carpets et al. I visited taxim square, nice place, the road that leads to the square is lined by malls, but mostly american stuff(victoria secret, Levi etc). all in all, nice place to visit, except for the language, it's easy to navigate, trains and buses are on time and the people are nice.

            "review": "Stunning & historic. Istanbul is a city for treasure hunters- it is filled with history from the time when it was capital of Byzantine Empire & subsequently Ottoman Empire. Blue Mosque leaves you speechless, it's architecture is stunning and it's so spiritual from inside. It's free to visit, but as it's an operational mosque please give respect as per local culture. Note on Fridays, the mosque is very busy in the afternoon (inside and courtyard is full) with Friday prayers taking place at about 1 pm. The mosque will be closed to tourists during this time.Hagia Sophia was a Church in Byzantine times, a mosque during Ottoman rule and is now a museum. It's full of history with artefacts from it's Christian & Muslim pasts. Topkapi Palace was in use for 400 years by Ottoman Sultans and you can observe the architecture, artefacts (e.g. Sultan's thrones, royal flasks etc), a section is also dedicated to holy personalities of Islam (as Ottoman Empire was the caliphate, it had many holy relics of Islam) and there are great views of Bosphorus from the Palace courtyard. The palace is huge and I will recommend at least half a day for your visit. Note you will need a separate ticket to visit the Harem area of the palace (15 TL) and it's a must see.I bought 3 days Istanbul Museum pass (costs 85 TL) which allows access to Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace including Harem and other Museums (Museum of Islamic Science & Technology, Archaeological Museum, Museum of Turkish & Islamic Art, Hagia Eirene, Great Palace Mosaic Museum). If you plan to visit these other museums then the pass is much more economical and most of these museums are walking distance from each other. I really liked the Museum of Islamic Science and Technology which included sections like, architecture, physics, chemistry, medicine, geography though would prefer a guide for this as some areas were a bit technical so would be good if someone can explain in layman's language. This museum is situated in Gulhane Park.Grand bazaar is not only historical (built in 15th century), it is full of traditional Turkish shops. If you like shopping, you will be spoilt for choice. Also, I thought Grand bazaar had the best currency exchange shops with very good FX rates (I was changing GBP to TL).Overall Istanbul is on the top of my list of best places to visit."

I was excited about seeing the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia as well as experiencing our first visit to a Muslim city. Our ship arrived at 1:00 pm and we scheduled the Bosporus Cruise for the afternoon. We were harassed by street vendors trying to sell us things the entire time we ventured from the ship. It really made any movement cumbersome. It was only when we were alone (free time on our tours) that we were less harassed. The street vendors in Istanbul were more aggressive than in any other European city we visited. They just don't take \"no\" for an answer and will follow you until you finally act mean. Being nice\\polite will only make it worse. I am not aggressive or mean by nature and forcing me to act this way ruined a good part of our visit. Please note that most people\\companies accept Euros, American dollars and Turkish lira. Ensure that you ask for change in the same denomination as you give them (before you make the purchase).It seemed that everyone we encountered wanted money. The Grand Bazaar was interesting but we could not pass a shop without the shop owners soliciting us. All we had to do was look at an item or stop at a shop window and they swarmed us. Nothing has a price tag in the tourist section of the Grand Bazaar and the initial price they quote is so high that bargaining is almost impossible (imagine something worth 5 euro on being quoted as 90 euro).If we ever revisit Istanbul, I will book tours with smaller Viator groups. Being in the large 50+ person groups made us targets for harassment. Also, you are less apt to find people who can speak English in Turkey."

As far as your eyes can see, the Bazaar is simply one shop or store after another of the most beautiful, interesting, gaudy, and exotic articles we could imagine. At some point all the stores selling the identical items all look alike and all the items appear to be the same: jewelry, leather goods, apparel, electronics, souvenirs, accessories and food. When you finish going up and down one avenue of stores there is another. This is a covered, indoor souk (middle eastern market) and what impressed us the most was how clean it was. The Grand Bazaar must host thousands upon thousands of people every day and yet it is orderly and, as I said, very clean. At some point, we stopped looking at individual shops and stalls and just took in the atmosphere. Plan on at least two hours to browse unless you want to do some serious shopping here. If you do, you will need a long time to go from store to store and from stall to stall to compare prices and quality."

A great resource in seeing all of the above is a web site: turkeytravelplanner.com Tom Brosnahan, author of many guide books, gives you a wealth of information on how to see this amazing city. He gives you background information on all the top sites, how and when to see them as well as restaurants and hotels. A top tip from him is to buy a \"museum pass\" before you visit the sites. This will save you a lot of money in entrance fees and time as you will not have to wait in line to purchase tickets. We purchased ours from our hotel....Dersaadet Hotel. Please see my review on Dersaadet. It is a perfect location to see all there is to see in Sultanahmet."

Also ask how much first before ordering at a restaurant .You can easily get around on the tram or by walking to your destination .There are bus routes for further places .Take time to see the grand bazar early as it gets very crowded and hard to walk around through all the people .Some shop owners will graciously offer you tea which is impolite to refuse. :-)At dinner time we found nice terrasses on quieter streets to enjoy great food and Baklava."

Istanbul has been an interesting city for many civilisations and for the most recents of 2, Byzantium and Ottomans, she has been the most valued of all. Ottomans tried to protect the sacred Christian buildings and kept them erect along the centuries. Now you can see few of the good samples of both civilisations on the same location; the old town square Sultan Ahmet Meydani. The best of all are the Hagia Sofia Cathedral and The Blue Mosque. The Cathedral is magnificent with its size and architectural beauty. Although it has been sort of converted into a mosque after the aottoman invasion in 1453, it has not been destroyed at all. So you can still see the frescoes and mosaics on the walls, beautiful, next to big wooden plates of Koran verbs. It is a museum that shall not be missed and it is a life time beauty to see. Next to it you can visit the infamous Blue Mosque which was built by a famous Ottoman architect, Mimar Sinan, as a show case of his competence in building the most beautiful mosque of the Ottoman Empire. It is as beautiful as the cathedral and a must see place. You will get shocked with all the ingenious details thought by that architect. Your spiritual side will have a shower with all the blue glass windows and the amazing architecture. Then probably the same day you can have a quick visit to the Basilica Cistern in the same square. It is the under ground water reservoir of the Byzantine which has been turned into a museum with a medieval lighting atmosphere. Famous Medusa head column is what you must see there amongst all the others. The next day you can visit Topkapi Palace, the long used Ottoman Palace.With all the buildings to see, gardens, churches, mosques, artefacts, etc you better reserve one full day for this palace. Don't miss the restaurant within the garden, that serves authentic Ottoman food. Can be a little expensive for a lunch but worth. You can also go there for dinner. Well, this would be my short 2 day trip to Istanbul's old town centre. Bear in mind, it is a massive city and it requires a good 4-5 day trip for a good coverage of all spectacular locations. Hope this short description gives you some tips for what to expect and see in Istanbul. So go there and get amazed..."

They do not bother anyone, so don't be wary of them.Not far from the historic sites is the Grand Bazaar. A must see. We enjoyed this place immensely and had a great time bartering for our purchases.

You could also check out the Grand Bazaar for a more hectic experience.Lots of places to buy a snack or coffee around the park between the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sofia. There's a coffee shop at the turkish baths across from the Hagia Sofia which sells Turkish coffee, which is worth trying too. Intense flavour. Sip slowly and enjoy.Like most major European tourist hubs, there are lots of locals wanting to befriend (and inevitably profit from) you or sell you things, although - in my experience - they were never unpleasant or threatening."

Istanbul is not like any other city, its the CITY, the capital of empires, the city where cultures have met, history has been re-written and the city where people from west and east meet, visit same places, eat in same restaurants and stay in the same hotels. My first visit was in 1993, but I did not enjoy as much as I did this time. Although the blue mosque is the same, hagia sophia is the same, sultan Suleiman is the same, but there are a lot more people, a lot more tourists and surely a lot more restaurants and hotels. This time I thought and felt that a week was enough, not too short, and not too long, so just enough to leave the city while feeling you have seen many things, but not everything so that you still want to visit again the future.The only thing I will do next time differently is to stay in a different hotel though!"

Attractions around Beyoglu include Galata Tower, Iskitlal Street, with its historic tram route, and the waterside edge. Cross Galata Bridge and experience the wealth of bazaars and mosques including the iconic Hagia Sophia. Take a taxi to the outlying attractions such as Pierre Lotti Cafe with amazing views across the Golden Horn towards the Bosphorous or the characterful residential districts, such as Balat with traditional painted houses. The Asian side offers many further attractions, all visible and accessible via the busy local ferry network, a day of mini boat trips in their right. The waterways provide views of the city and the activities along the edges, fishing mainly, combined with the array of boats and shipping within the channels are all well worth the trip. Nightlife is superb, lively and very civil. Reina, an open air club set below the Bosphorous Bridge and its waterfront views, is an amazing night out.I resolve to find an excuse to return!"

I can't explain it but there's something about this area that makes me feel so alive...it might be because I was struck with WANDERLUST during my first trip to Istanbul 2 1/2 years ago. The Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, just to name a few, all are right there. Of course, there's too many other sites to name here. This area is my favorite place in THE WORLD out of all the places I have traveled to. One WARNING, though: be aware of \"friendly\" Turks who are trying to lure you to buy things or lure you to other shops. At first they appear to be friendly. However, their ONLY intent is to direct you to their local shops. They can be SO rude, annoying, and somewhat hostile. My advice is just to say you're in a hurry and move on. DO NOT FALL FOR THEIR TRICKS! This is the only downside to this area as everywhere else in Istanbul is fine. Besides this minor inconvenience, Sultanahmet and its environs are absolutely amazing!"

This really is a an eye opener. The culture.. The history.. The traditions mixed with the modern day. It's a very bustling busy city.. A bit dusty. Be prepared to haggle and be ready for some unwelcome attention - if you are a woman. That said.. Enjoy the grande Bazaar .. The blue mosk.. And the hospitality.,try the apple tea.. The coffee.. The sweets.. And have a Turkish bath. It is a truly unique .. But enjoyable Turkish experience!"

Fish markets , outdoor restaurants ,Galati tower and the 2nd oldest underground tram after London, that take you up the Tunel.Just start I the Sultanahmet and work your way down to the Galata bridge. Check out the grand bizarre and the spice market. Plan to pay 1 TL To visit a toilet, pick up a bottle of drinking water for the walk, most people shouldn't drink tap water. Most street food is ok but I'd avoid those mussels with lemon"

It also sadly has horrid, hole in the ground toilets that you can queue for 30 minutes for and pay 2 euros for the privilege. After a week there we would recommend it to anybody but feel the turkish tourist board have a very long way to go to make it a better destination. We went in shoulder season, september, the weather was great but there were hoards of sight seers, especially at week ends. Language is a problem if you do t speak turkish. We do not recommend taking taxis on the street after several bad and pricey experiences. The Metro, which i would never normally take, unless kicking and screaming, was fast, efficient, easy and definitely a better transportation option."

Be sure to check when these sites are open and closed as both Topkapi Palace and the Hagia Sophia are closed on Mondays and certain holiday days, Blue Mosque has religious services during the day for which the mosque is closed to visitors, and the Roman Cistern is closed at certain times. Check opening times of the Harem inside Topkapi Palace as well, which is a separate exhibition with different opening and closing times, and very worth while seeing. Enjoying a nice leisurely walk to and through the various highlights, with a stop for lunch, is a great 6-8 hour day, topped with an end of the day visit to the Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar, which both close at 7:00pm, (again check when open and hours for both Bazaars). At the Grand Bazaar, be sure to work your way into the original old bazaar, for what I think are very interesting old shops."

Major must sees are The Topkapi Palace, The Hagia Sophia and The Blue Mosque. Also worth seeing are The Spice Market and the Grand Bazaar. Mosques are everywhere but some more important than others. I would recommend anyone to get a Istanbulkart (bit like an Oyster Card in London) You can use them on the trains, trams, buses and ferries. One card will cover up to 5 people and costs 10TL which includes 4TL of credit. Once you have purchased one just top up with increments of 10TL. I would suggest 20TL if two of you etc. The tram from Kabatas ferry terminal near the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace is a good place to start. Just travel to Eminonu for another ferry terminal, the Galata bridge, Spice Market and a walk uphill to the Grand Bazaar.. A couple of stops further at Sultanahmet gets you near to the Topkapi Palace Museum, The Hagia sophia and the Blue Mosque"

I bought a token (jeton) for 4 TL from a machine outside the Pier, embarked, disembarked and let myself wander and stop to try bites of specific dishes. I first started at Halil Lahmachun. A must! Crisp thin bread topped with beef, parsley and spices, helped by an Ayran. Then I saw the word Hamsi ( anchovies), a black sea speciality. I ended up trying marinated sea bass and Bluefish that was in season as noted by the restaurateur. I asked for very small plates as I knew I was not going to stop there. While mesmerized by the colorful sight of olives, dry vegetables and fish and just the mere energy, I kept falling on delicacies I wanted to try. Kokorec which is the tripes of the lamb was exquisite. I chose the plate as it was small and with no bread. I was starting to feel uncomfortable from all the food I ate but then I fell on Kumpir station, a baked potato, with the flesh removed, mashed and then an array of choices to top it including a type of bulgur, corn,pickles,... I asked the vendor to put it in to go container and I enjoyed its sight while I was satisfying all my senses with all random dances, chanting and music in the street. I had a smile for the whole time. Are you hungry yet?"

We had an incredible time, the whole area was like a museum. The restaurants around the area and the dancing shows all fit together to give us a unique memorable experience.We are devoted Catholics and fully respect other religions, we were thrilled to listen to the five times a day \"Ezan\" (Muslim call to prayer) throughout the entire city. Every time it happened we were mesmerized. It was an incredible experience to listen to the powerful, beautiful and peaceful sound of the Ezan. Later we found out that each mosque has a person called Muezzin appointed to lead and recite the Ezan during the different times of the day. In the old days, the Muezzin was on top of one of the Minarets (Towers at the mosque) so he could be heard around the mosque. Now, mosques have loudspeakers mounted on top of the minaret, the muezzin uses a microphone, allowing the Call to prayer to be heard at great distances without climbing the minaret. When calling to prayer, the Muezzin faces the Qiblah, the direction of the Ka'bah in Mecca, while he recites the Ezan.We strongly recommend that if you are going to visit Istanbul, plan to spend a few days walking around the Historic Areas which are the heart of the city."

Almost free ( take a Istanbul Card and ride for 1,5 Lira or 0,4 \u20ac). When you take a boat trip. Avoid the tourist boats. They cost you al lot of money and you'll be treated like cattle.

These historical Places are in the same area close to each other except for the grand Bazaar which may necessitate a short bus ride. 2 days: In addition to the above a sea cruise along the Bosphorus with a visit of the historical Rumelihisar\u0131 or Roumeli Hisar Castle and possibly Anadolu Hisar\u0131 or Anatolian Castle.3 days: In addition to the above a visit to the S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque, to Chora Church or Kariye Camii, the Galata Tower, the Taksim Square and \u0130stiklal Caddesi.Each one of these places deserves a review which will be coming in the future.

The Blue mosque and the Aya Sofia are simply magical and then there is the Tokapi Palace. And all the areas around. At night it is mystical wondering around, but be warned you are not alone as there are many many other tourists doing exactly the same as you. It is alive by day and night. I think that the outside of the main buildings are as impressive as when seen within. Not to be missed. I would recommend staying at a hotel nearby as you will want to spend a lot of time there."

Turkish men are very respectful of women, unlike Egyptian men. You won 't be ogled or harassed. The Hippodrome is the center of all the main attractions like the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia etc. The Big Bus tour starts here. You buy a 24 hour ticket and you can hop on and off wherever you want. The buses run every 20 minutes. So if you want to try the Taksim section and Dolmabache Palace, this is the way to do it.There are a mind boggling number of caf\u00e9s and restaurants all over Sultanahmet. Don't be afraid to explore on foot. We never felt unsafe or unwelcome. Stop anyone on the street and they will happily give you directions.Absolutely wear good sturdy walking shoes. The streets are brick and surfaces very uneven.Your best value for seeing the attractions is to buy a 3 or 5 day museum pass. You save money and you won't have to wait in incredibly long lines to get tickets at each venue."

Istanbul is in every aspect a city like no other on earth! One leg firmly planted in Europe and the other in Asia, divided by the sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn.Do not miss a visit to the Basilica Cistern. The mystical grandeur of this architectural wonder with it's impressive columns is absolutely breathtaking! The orientation of the two Medusa heads (one placed upside down and the other one sideways) has been a question of much discussion. The Basilica Cistern was built in the 6th century AD by Byzantine Emperor Justinian. The cistern provided water to various properties.Escape the heat and marvel this absolute gem in Sultanahmet!The Hagia Sofia museum/church (Ayasofya) whose name means \"Holy Wisdom\" in Greek was built in the 6th Century AD. The Hagia Sofia is extremely rich and diverse in history, culture and architecture - from Byzantine Basilica (Greek Orthodox) to Mosque and since 1935 a museum.The building with all it's grandeur both inside and outside is truly spectacular and not to be missed! The tombs at the back of the Hagia Sofia are also very interesting to see.It is lovely to sit in the park next to the Blue Mosque on the benches with magnificent views of the illuminated minarets of the Blue Mosque in the evening. Men are not allowed to wear shorts and women's head, shoulders and knees need to be covered before entering the Blue Mosque. Shoes must also be removed and bags are provided at the entrance to put them in. I can strongly advise all women travelling to Istanbul to keep a scarf (pashmina) in their handbags. Not only do you need it when entering Mosques but it can be handy if you want to feel a little more \"covered\" while travelling in Turkey.Do not miss the \"footbaths\" on the park side of the Mosque.The Grand Bazaar is one of the largest covered markets in the world with 60 streets and 400 shops that has been an important trading center since 1461.The Bazaar is within 15 minutes walk from the Hagia Sofia & Blue Mosque. Follow the tram line straight up and you will find the covered market on your right.Yes, it is crowded with tourists, pushy salesmen and thousands of shops but with the right attitude and a sense of humor a visit to the bazaar can be fun (haggle for prices) and a unique Turkish experience.Take a picture of the entrance (numbered) where you enter the bazaar to make sure you won't get lost!My husband and I did not stay far from the Arasta Bazaar (Eresin Crown Hotel - proven to be an excellent choice) which is well worth a visit. The Arasta Bazaar consists of one street with shops on both sides. The quality of the goods on display are a cut above the rest in comparison to many other overpriced shops in the Sultanahmet district.Do not miss the Topkapi Palace! The Topkapi Palace was once the primary residence of the Ottoman Sultans for approximately 400 years - fascinating and intriguing! The Palace is situated behind the Hagia Sofia, within a 5 minute's walk.I can strongly suggest to stay in the Sultanahmet area as it is within walking distance to all the historic sites and gems that Istanbul has to offer.Do try the Ottoman cuisine at one of the many restaurants in the area. Cooked with love and care and bursting with flavor!Buy bottled water at supermarkets/cafes for it is much cheaper than at the stands surrounding the popular attractions. Wine can also be bought in supermarkets/cafes at reasonable prices. For those of you that do not know - liquor is very expensive in Istanbul.Do your research thoroughly before you visit Istanbul. It will help to better understand the rich and diverse history and culture that lies in the historic areas of Istanbul.We fell in love with Istanbul during our visit in June 2013. Two and a half days were not nearly enough to explore all the gems this marvelous city has to offer! On the other hand, it is a very good excuse to visit Istanbul again as soon as possible!We cannot wait to go back!"

This is one of the most interesting places I have ever been and we could not get everything we wanted to do completed in a week. We're coming back!There is so much history here one is overwhelmed with the available options. Take advantage of things like the hop-on-hop-off buses, guides, the tram lines, ferries and Metro. It will help your experience, but be sure to walk and see the great little surprises (and cats) the city has to offer! Get an Istanbul card (kiosk in Metro stations allow you to purchase cards for 10 TL - 4 for the card itself - have 10 TL bills if possible) and put money on it. It works on all public transit and will make your life much easier. Everyone is courteous, the food is some of the best in the world, and the views from all directions are incredible. Be sure to see Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque and Topkapi by night. It's incredible. We got an added bonus of a big, full moon. One important key to enjoying some of the historical places is to start early. Lines can get long, especially if cruise ships are in port. We did not get a museum pass which is a good idea. We had a guide so that took care of a lot of line issues for us. Also, be sure to respect the mosque rules and the local culture. It is important. This is one of the most culturally and historically interesting cities in the world."

The area is inhabited since the stone age. What I like is that the tourist area was a capital of two of the most importants empires for about 1600 years. E.g. Hagia Sophia, built in 532 is not even very old compared to the city. What I dislike is the crown during summer. If you wish to visit Topkap\u0131 you should go there is November to February.

I am Turkish but lived in New Jersey with an American husband.My daughter asked me what I wanted for my 70th Birthday, I told her: \"to go to Istanbul with my closest and dearest Friends\".So it happened, 4 from the USA! Two from the UK, my three children and my four grandchildren and spouses. I made the plan to see the Old Town.First Day: Sultan Ahmet (Blue Mosque) - Binbir Direk (Water Cistern) - Aya Sofya (Santa Sophia).Day 2 - Relax and rest on a Turkish Gullet going up and down the Bosphorus.Day 3 - Misir Carsisi (Spice Market) - Rustem Pasa Mosque (my favorite mosque in Istanbul) - lunch at Havuzlu in Kapalicarsi (best restaurant of authentic Ottoman dishes in the Covered Bazar) Day 4 - Private Turkish Hammam experience at our fabulous Boutique Hotel, Sumahan on the Water - Visit of Beykerbeyi Palace.Day 5 - Yildiz Park - Dolmabahce - Suleymaniye - Tombs of Suleyman the Magnificent and Hurrem Sultan.Day 6 - Birthday Party at the fabulous Sumahan.Day 7 - We all left some to Greece, some back to UK, ourselves to Bodrum.What they didn't see and should be seen:Topkapi, somehow it didn't happen, it is closed on Tuesday and still being repaired. KARIYE Church for me almost more beautiful than Aya Sofya and lunch at Asitane.Eyup Sultan and visit of tomb of the Saint - walk up the hill among old tombs and tea or early dinner at Pierre Loti Cafe, best view in Istanbul - return by Ferry to see the Golden Horn.Buyuk Ada, the lovely and historic Princess Island.Ortakoy and it's great Fish Restaurants, also great shopping at lovely boutiques and galleries.The Koc Museum.Just to prove that one week in Istanbul is not enough!And I believe that seeing three sites is more than enough or you get what I call \"Museum Indigestion\"!I have been in 52 countries, Istanbul still is and remains for me the most beautiful, exotic and interesting city."

Can thoroughly recommend the Hotel Erboy for its location for these sites and the quality of the hotel and breakfast exceeded its 3 star rating. It was a mere 200 meters from the main square (Hippodrome) and a short further walk to the many sites that Istanbul's old quarter is renowned for.The words of warning are be prepared for long queues, some restricted opening hours, do not go near this area on any Turkish national holiday, the entry prices are steep and the walking and gazing in awe take a lot of time, so a number of days are required to do everything justice.You will, if visiting Istanbul for this experience, have planned for the main sites so do stagger your time and the days and plan the precise times to visit. You will take a thousand photos so new camera batteries (because many photos require flash photography) are essential, as is your water bottle and hat for shade. A suggestion is to initially take the Hop On Hop Off bus (2 hour circuit) between Taksim - Sultanahmet - over the Bosphorus and through fascinating neighbourhoods to orient yourself. Then you will appreciate the location of the sites / many mosques / palaces that you intend to visit. The local tram in Sultanahmet is a useful way to cover the area down to the Golden Horn ferries and further afield to the Grand Bazaar.This is a walking tour like no other. It will leave you spellbound by the sights, the architecture, the sheer expanse of the domes, the interiors and mosaics, the sheer colossal size of the structures, the extent of the Topkipi Palace (longest queues are here), and minarets are everywhere. Plan well and leave yourself time as rushing is not possible and will mean you miss so much if you perhaps only have the one trip to this huge city. The meeting of Europe - Asia is a reality in the historic area of Istanbul and this collection of sites and domes and mosaics is an equal of all that ancient Athens offers."

After reading 'The Tournament' by Matthew Reilly, the only place that was not on the our pre-booked small tour (with Istanbul Daily Tours - see my review) was the Basilica Cistern. After disembarking early we set off to exchange some Euros to Turkish Lira. Note to all travellers to Turkey's Karakoy port district. The only bank in a row of five that exchanges Euro is the Turkish Bank, and that is after you wait longer than time spent at any NSW RMS office. The good news the bank is across the road from the Ferry terminal and the light rail station of Kabatas Sea Bus Pier. When we arrived at the underground station, after missing the cars and buses on the busy road, there was an assistance ready to give locals and tourist a hand with the ticketing machines. She had to complete a questionnaire re: the quality of service of the light rail. This was a no brainer, as only Sydney builds a new Cruise Terminal without pubic transport link - you reading this Minister for Transport Gladys Berejiklian. For 2 TL each ($1) we were on the light rail to the Sultanahmet (the old area of Istanbul). On arrival there were met by high school students working as Tourism Ambassadors wearing T-shirts with the sigh 'Ask me'. Guess what I did, as we were free wheeling it - I asked for directions, they were very helpful and walked us to the entrance of the Cistern. Thankyou, Istanbul for a wonderful welcome to your country.Another bucket list location, Wow, what an experience, more columns, this time it was flood lit, underground, with a walkways over the water. The photos are from the iPad as Security Police Other Half did not want the pick pockets to take our camera. Low lux and no flash make dark and eerie photos.Please take the plunge and use local transport and all the attractions are in easy walking distance, The Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and Hippodrome."

We arrived late at night and my wife uses a wheelchair. When the reception man saw it he said, I put you in a room with a lovely view on the fifth floor. He immediately apologised, and said he would find us better. So we were put on the third floor. I must explain that the reception on street level is up nine steps and represents the second floor. So we were on the third floor, up a further flight of stairs. Breakfast is served in and adjacent to the garden area on the first floor. It was a bit inconvenient and I mention this as it is not suitable for someone very disabled who cannot manage stairs at all. Fortunately with help we could do so. The men/boys running the hotel could not be more helpful, they carried the wheelchair in and out every time we needed to. Plus help us also, this was without asking them, they were always there waiting. Absolutely brilliant. They also advised us about getting about in Istanbul, we were just ten minutes from Sultanahmet the main area for the sightseeing. The Blue Mosque, The Koptapi Palace, the city bus tours and Bosphorus boat trips, those these go from many areas. The historic Cistern, and the tram stops. They advised us to get tram passes, similar to London Oyster cards. 7 Lira per pass, then each use is half price. The trams are modern, superb, every few seconds apart. Very well used and we used them a lot, very easy with the wheelchair, though sometimes a little crowded. We were out at least eleven hours every day, and as it was Ramadan, families in their hundreds gathered each night in Sultanahmet a truly incredible sight. All sorts of traders, like barrow boys were out all the time and a great party atmosphere. The Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar were just short tram rides away and fantastic places to visit. The hop on hop off buses were great too, two serperate routes and you could buy a 24 hour or 48 hour pass for these. The staff on these were very friendly and excellent, recorded commentaries in many languages are available in the price. Well worth doing first to get all locations in your sights for visiting later. Also the Bosphorus boat tours are very good too. There is a fantastic transport museum, which was a 15 minute bus ride away from the tram stop for the spice market, Eminonu. The Koch transport museum. Every type of transport here, Planes, boats, trains, trams, cars, tractors, a London bus and much, much, more. We spent three hours in there absolutely brilliant. This review cannot do justice to the things to see and do. Then we went to the Asian side where we stayed with a Turkish friend. This side was also very interesting but more modern, not quite the same history, but many beautiful areas. Uskudar and Kadikoy, Fenerbahce were the main areas we visited. Including Maiden's Tower and Princes Islands by boat. All in all a wonderful vibrant city, very safe and very friendly helpful people everywhere. Highly recommended."

The location is central, with access to public transport and good caf\u00e9s. Day 1: Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia museum, Topkapi Palace with lunch at the Konak restaurant within the palace grounds. Tram to Grand Bazaar and then relax with the Bosphorous Cruise operated by Sehir Hatlari. Day 2: Princes' Islands by Sehir Hatlari local ferry. The smaller island of Kinaliada was more peaceful and less crowded than the biggest island. Took the Funicular from Beyoglu to Taksim. Shopping paradise with no traffic. Day 3: Galata Tower, lazy breakfast and beautiful view from the top of the tower. Has an elevator so a breather from walking. Lots of eateries and shops for picking up memories. Istanbul has good connectivity within the City and you can completely avoid cabs if you want for visiting the major tourist attractions."

Eating freshly caught barbecued mackerel in bread under the Galata bridge. the buzz of all this was wonderful but the trams travelling around the inner roads of istanbul were a bit scary.

I wrote reviews of the key sites we visited, Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, and Topkapi Palace. The surprise for the day was the Bosphorous lunch boat cruise and Grand Bazaar. We loved the boat cruise. We had a guided tour throughout the lunch and had wonderful picture taking opportunities. We sampled some typical Turkish food for lunch and appreciated the respite on the boat. We also thought the Grand Bazaar was very interesting. We expected it to be outside and little huts. Instead, it was indoors and huge. We didn't have much time there, and while I'm not sure there were any great buys there, I would have liked to spend more time walking around and checking out the vendors. Istanbut was one of the highlights of our entire Mediterranean cruise!"

We stayed in a quaint boutique hotel near the historic area and then wandered around the area for a day of our own relaxed sightseeing, with tips drawn from online reviews. Since we had visited Istanbul about 15 years previously, we went to some of the offbeat areas that most tourists don't go to.However, I had booked online a few small group and private tours weeks prior to our departure, so that we could bypass the long lines of ticket seekers at the main attractions and spend more time in the sights. It is well worth the money, as the tours include the entrance tickets, guide and lunch for the all day tours.I would highly recommend taking about 3 - 4 days to see the Basilica Cistern, Afa Sofya, Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, the archeology museums, Suleymaniye Mosque, Galata Tower, Dolmabahce Palace, Grand Bazaar, and Hagia Sophia. Of course, pace your self so that you have an enjoyable time, good Turkish coffee and \"delights,\" of course, and a wonderful lunch each day. If you are staying nearby, return at night to get some pics of the impressive buildings."

Frequent tram service - easy to use, think next time I might get a travel card, however if you are taking one journey and switching from tram to train, they might charge you for separate journeys, so not like taking the tube/overground in London. Cheap to travel though, 4 lire for one journey irrespective of distance on the same mode of transport. if you want to go to the Asian side on public transport you can take the train for ferry, depending on which ferry company you use, prices vary.major sites in the Sultanahmet all worth seeing, but Museum of Turkish and Islamic was closed, so i think in Fairness, Turkey should have reduced the price of the Museum pass, a three day pass is priced at 85 lire. some hotels in the sultanahment are situated on slopes, so be careful if you are using a wheelchair or buggies.recommend: rooftop dinner so you can enjoy meal/drink with blue mosque and hagia in the skylinetea on the far side of Gulhane Park, great ocean views (food is ok, like eating in a greasyspoon)"

The mosques, the bazaars, the palaces, the museums, the old back streets of Sultanahmet are all must do's. Istanbul is modern yet ancient and has so much for everyone. It is so easy to get around on public transport using an Istanbul card but be prepared for hills. They are everywhere.

The mixture of Byzantium, Constantinople & Ottoman is fascinating & many visitors never make it out of the historic area of Sultanahmet as there is so much to see there! It is probably worth hiring a guide or going on a day tour as this really brings it all 'alive'. Even after you have seen the major sites, there is so much to see by wandering the streets, going to restaurants & walking along the road with the Marmara Sea on one side & the Roman walls on the other. As 2 women on our own we always felt quite safe here, although we made sure to keep to the main roads at night!"

I had a bad experience on the cruise they charged me for 5 hours and were fooling us by bring us back within 1.5hours.I seriously didn't like the people of Turkey they are kind of rude, language is a major issue since they speak only Turkish.wear your backpack on the front, too many thieves around, you gotta be careful Shop from Sisli, Taksim and Blue Mosque area for better pricing.

You can't ask directions or glance at something you like without being pounced on by aggressive vendors. Even buying a tram token a little boy inserted himself to push the buttons and \"help\" us. When finished he wanted us to buy something from him. We saw a kid working the street for 12 hours selling stuff while his Father looked on from his own street purse sales area. Around the attractions were fake guides trying to take your money to get you in. We were at the Blue Mosque and were approached by many. The attraction is free and the wait time is short. While standing in line I observed some of them. They would take money from the tourists and walk them to the head of the line and they would simply push them to jump the line. I think it might be somewhat tolerated by the official staff, but not sure. I wanted to shop more there, but the aggressiveness was totally offensive. I personally would have bought something if they weren't so pushy. I travel with my Sister and this is one of the few cities I did not feel comfortable in. No matter where we went men would try to strike up phony conversations. Where are you from? Do you want to go to my shop to buy something? Like I said \"exhausting\", staying vigilant against the scammers and pickpockets. I'm not saying not to go. Just be aware!"

There is so much culture and the archeology is there in front of your face. I did all the usual sites such as Aya Sophia, Blue Mosque, underground cistern, Topkapi Palace in one day and the Dolma Bachi Palace is definately worth a visit. I really enjoyed the cruise on the Bospherous and the trip to Pierre Lotti and the short cable car ride back down the hillside. We hired a guide for the first day to visit the main four attractions and probably paid over the odds (100 British pounds). We were later told that we could have gotten a guide for about \u00a3 50 however we didn't need to wait in lengthy lines with over an hour wait for each attraction. The museum of archeology is undergoing some restoration work at the moment but is well worth a visit. You can see everything from Roman and Greek statues to Asyrian artifacts and tombs and Egyptian sarcofagi. Very impressive. There's simply so much to see and do here you can't possibly get bored."

Bosphorus boat ride was great! Yet, do not purchase it from your hotel. Go down to the Oblisque and look for a tour there. You should be able to find a two hour tour for $25 US. You do not need to pay more than this. Also, take the public ferry to Princess Islands...go to the last stop and enjoy the horses! Make sure you have dinner with all the Turks on the Island and do NOT MISS THE LAST BOAT. It is probably about 830pm in the summer. ENJOY, ENJOY!!! Plan your time as to how much time you are willing to listen about carpet. It is fun, yet there is a LOT to do. (Hagia Sohia, perhaps get in line before 10am to avoid some crowds.) HAVE FUN!"

The Greeks and Romans each in their time made it a Capital. The Ottoman Turks greatly expanded it. It's all there to see. Hagia Sophia, the architectural marvel of its age, the Basilica Cisterns and the remnants of the Roman Hippodrome, the beautiful Blue Mosque with its blue tile, the Chora church with its modest exterior and stunning mosaic filled interior, bejeweled Topkapi Palace and the 19th Century Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace all lie waiting for the visitor.

Topkapi Palace is right beside the Hagia Sophia but my advise is to keep a major part of the day for it and not to club it together with the rest. You can finish at the Grand Bazaar, the day you cover the mosques and the Cistern. The charm of Istanbul lies in Sultanahmet. When you are not doing the historical sites, you can enjoy its numerous cobble stoned paths and the cafes there in. We loved it........"

Afraid of getting lost? you most probably will! but don't panic, you'll probably find your way out as easily as you got lost.Try and get a bearing on the main drag as soon as you get in, and try your best to work the place in a grid fashion. It won't take you long to get the hang of it.The best deals are deeper in the bazzar where the faint hearted tend not venture into. Start off at 50% of the asking price and move up as quickly or slowly as the vendor does. Be prepared to walk away from the deal if it's not going your way. There's a good chance the shopkeeper will give in if he sees that you were interested in the article, but are not prepared to pay any more than your best offer.Once you have bought something, it's best not to comparison shop or you'll be disappointed! If you want to comparison shop then do it before you buy something.If you really like it, then buy it right away, cause trying to find the shop that offered the best deal may take you a lot of time.Probably best if you take a break part way and come back, and shop some more.If you go to the places that sell food outside the gates, just make sure that the menu they show you has prices on it. It's a scam! If you make the mistake of ordering from the menu that had no prices beside or below the menu item, you'll end up paying between 3-5 times the price.The Grand bazzar is a blast! and an experience not to be missed when in Istanbul.Happy shopping!"

Lots of people about, tourist and locals.I enjoyed the atmosphere in Sultanahmet also but it is almost all tourist of course. Beware the Carpet Store Salesman... be firm and walk away! Istiklal is a great festive atmosphere and certainly has as many locals as tourist if not more, long walk and very crowded at night. If you are into architecture, go during the day and enjoy the buildings as I did. My only trip to Fatih was to see the Valens Aqueduct, and it is definitely not a tourist spot, all locals and a long walk from the Tram, and toward the end you have to pass under the road down some steps."

Then head to Carsamba, you may think you are visiting somewhere in Middle East, one of the most conservative neighborhood in Istanbul. Chora Museum takes 10 minutes walk from Carsamba, mosaics and frescoes are well preserved, worth for a visit.

Topkapi palace in the morning then head out to the Galata tower in the afternoon to enjoy a view of the city from the highest point in Istanbul.Enjoy the restaurants by the Galata bridge including watching the ships and fishermen as well as the view of the city at night,don't worry Metro runs till midnight.4th day:Take the metro to the tunnel and walk Ishtikal street towards Takshim square where you can shop and enjoy the food for the last time."

The Blue mosque was lovely, The Palace was beautiful and the restaurant inside is breathtaking with amazing views. I enjoyed the Grand Bazaar also being a big shopper,but have to say the Princes Islands were by far my favorite attraction, we got off on the first island and did a bike trip and then a full island trek by horse and cart. There are no cars on the island and the views were spectacular. If you're going to Istanbul, definitely visit these."

Must sees: Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Topkapi Palace, Bosphorus cruise. We ate dinner on a rooftop to see the gorgeous view. Prepare for vendors everywhere. In the rain they sold umbrellas, at the mosque they sold scarves. Note: At the Blue Mosque it is free, they do have a donation area at the end if you choose. Clothing to cover arms, legs, and scarves for women is required, but they have those for you free when you enter if you come unprepared. Aya Sophia, Topkapi both require tickets - try to get at a booth outside instead of waiting in line. Or get the day before. I recommend trying some of the foods/drinks from the standing vendors. Nice to try something different! BEWARE: Some attractions are closed one day a week, may be different from another. I missed the Archaelogical Museum and Florence Nightingals Museum because of this. Check ahead. Also: Tourist areas have regular toilets (WC signs), but occasionally you will run into the \"hole-in-the-ground\" ones only. Be sure to \"go\" when you have a toilet convenient to you that you like."

Sultanhamet is where you want to be if you want to see Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque or the Basilica Cistern. It's a wonderful bustling part of town, filled with tourists and locals, who are mostly trying to sell some snacks or cheap goods. The tram that runs on the street is useful to take you to the Grand Bazaar as well as Eminonu where you can either catch a boat to the European side or go for a cruise along the Bosphorus. You can also catch the metro over to Taxim Square and go for a walk on the very modern Istiklal Cad. I love the place. So much history, so much to see, not too expensive if you shop around and barter. Easy to navigate, with reliable public transport (don't forget your city card). Top it you and use it on tram, metro, buses, and some of the ferry's. On the minus side, they hard sell you at the restaurants that line the street, the food may taste good but the portions are tiny and expensive. Also I'll never get over the little kids begging, but I suppose that happens in a lot of places."

Have some Grilled fish near the ferry terminals (fish is freshly fought from the see and grilled in front of you on a small boat). Then get back to the hotel have rest and go to the restaurant for a dinner!2nd Day: Bosphorus trip. Same Eminenu embankment. At 10.35 a ferry goes from there to the very top of Bosphorus, to the black sea. (You need to get there not past 9.30 or you risk not to get a place with a view on a ship). You go to the last stop Anadolu Cavagi, past Sariyer and go see the old castle overlooking the mouth of Boshorus there. Have lunch and at 15.00 the same ferry goes back to Istanbul to arrive there at 16.25. Get some rest and go to a good restaurant for some good local food.3d Day: Topkapi palace, Suleimanie mosque with the tombs of Suleiman and Roksolana and off to the Taksim square in the newer part of Istanbul to walk on the Istiklal street. In the evening find yourself a place to eat with a good view over the city to have some food and wine and complete your stay in this magnificent city!"

We had spent all the 5 days of our Istanbul stay in the Sultanahmet area which has the maximum concentration of the famous historic sites in Istanbul \u2013 Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and next door Archeological museum, Basilica Cistern and many more. You can also take the tram from there to Kabattas station to visit Dolmabahce palace \u2013 a truly \u2018don\u2019t miss\u2019 attraction. Few tips about Sultanahmet area if you are planning to take accommodation \u2013 the hotels behind Blue Mosque though are in quieter area but the Prayers from the Mosque will penetrate through the walls of the hotel rooms very easily and multiple times in the day, evening and night. We had spent the 1st four nights there and experienced it, we were on the other side of Sultanhamet square towards Grand Bazar on our last day ( for reference check this address - Rast Hotel - Binbirdirek Mah. Klodfarer Cad. No:4 Sultanahmet ) and that location is much better , every attraction of Sultanahmet is easy to reach from there besides you are steps away from the Tram lines, main street, local food options and the shopping options including the Mega hub of Grand Bazar. Loved the energy and people of Sultanahmet area. One more thing: the queue to the major sites such as Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace is always a very long one \u2013 you will save a lot of time if you buy a Museum pass (available right in front of Hagis Sophia or you can buy online and get it delivered to your hotel in Istanbul ahead of your arrival as I did) . Suleymaniye mosque is another attraction around that location that you should not miss if you are in Sultanhamet , plan to cover this mosque when you are visiting Grand Bazar because it is somewhere close \u2013 we asked people and found our way though we had to walk for about 20-25 minutes. Another historic site worth visiting is the Chora Church ( or Kariye Museum ) \u2013 the Church of the Holy Saviour \u2013 we took a cab to reach there for about 15 Lira \u2013 be careful about the Taxi drivers \u2013 they can really take you for a ride unless you negotiate a fixed price before you get it. That\u2019s it from now\u2026.. I just shared my experience from our very recent trip to Istanbul \u2013 hope you find it useful.Regards,Ujjwal MukherjeeBangalore, India"

Ask the concierge to order a taxi if you are leaving from the hotel.Every carpet store seems to have a tout outside. Don't show an interest.

Personally we didn't think the Museum Card (50TL) to jump the queues was worth it and the additional 85TL for entry to most of the main attractions is only really saving you money if you plan to do absolutely everything, or visit the same place more than once. Save your money and instead buy some souvenirs!"

There is never a dull day here with all the museums and other local attractions to visit. However, your visit can be spoiled by scamming taxis. If possible try to travel by bus or train which is cheaper and can be crowded during certain times of the day. If you must use a taxi, trust your gut instincts and follow my tips. Here are some tips: ask for cost of trip to destination before getting into taxi. If they can't give you a set price and claim they have to use the meter then find another taxi. If you know it will cost you an average amount to get to the destination it should be the same returning. If you are quoted a price twice that usual amount, find another taxi. Most taxis will give you a price like 30,35, 40, 45 TL and et cetera but if you get a number like 69 TL the taxi is trying to scam you. For example, you give him 50TL and two 10 TL he will do a switch and say you only gave him a 5 TL and two 10 TL to confuse you and hoping you will pay more money. I have been to Istanbul many times I knew the average cost of fare plus I didn't have any 5TL in my possession so I didn't fall for this scam. What you should do if you feel like you are being scammed, don't pay while you still sitting in taxi. Get out of the taxi and give him the usual fare you pay and quickly walk away. If you are at your hotel and there is a doorman nearby call him over if the taxi driver continues to argue with you. You can also pretend you are calling the police or Jandarma this will settle the \"argument\" real quick and he will leave.If the taxi claim he will need to drop you off few blocks from your destination because there is too much traffic.Tell him no or hayir and have him take you directly to your destination. Anyone who have been to Istanbul many times it doesn't matter what time of the day it is there is going to be traffic. Don't fall for that excuse that it is too much traffic to be drop off directly at your destination.If the taxi initially agree to a set price then change it upon arriving to your destination. Give him the agreed set price. There is also another way you could get scammed in stores at the mall where the business will say your card is not approved or was declined after swiping your credit card. If you know that is not possible, make sure you check your bank account to make sure there was no charges. If there are then dispute them immediately. Usually they want you to pay in cash that is why they say the card was not approved. Keep your receipts. Other than that, enjoy Istanbul and don't let the few scammers ruin your visit. Always trust your instincts."

You are always welcome but you must be respectful and follow strict dress codes (ladies should always carry a headscarf with them in Istanbul).Continue your walk up to the beautiful Eyup cemetery for wonderful views of the Golden Horn.

If you'd like a lovely Turkish Steambath Hamam experience the Ottoman Hamam right on the Hippodrome is well worth it.

There are many people offering the same guided cruise, which your guide might persuade you to take for a fortune, from as little as 8 Turkish Lira.In Istanbul,if you stay in the historical quarter on the Asian side,most of the tourist sights ,including the famous bazaar are within a walking distance.We enjoyed the food from the small cafes,as well as some of the street food. During winter the small fish served with a large flat bread and salad,which we bought from a street vendor was most enjoyable. Turkish food is not only Sheesh kebab,the fish served in a toasted flat bread with salad is absolutely delicious..Turkey has a wonderful array of food available.We bought fresh baklava and turkish delight which is far better than the prepacked ones, to take home.The Turkish people are very warm and hospitable people,despite not being fluent in English..Whilst in Istanbul dont forget to visit the Spice Bazaar where you can buy lemon tea,a cure recommended for coughs and colds ,by the Turkish people .I am definitely considering a visit to Turkey again."

You will walk through the street Istiklal Caddess which is the backbone of the Beyoglu area. Galata tower will also be on the same path & it's about half an hour walk with very slow pace.

Tram is the best way to get round the city because you will not be stuck in horrendous traffic; it's dam cheap costs around 65 pence per journey with Istanbul card.

It is all worth seeing, and the cost isn't too high. I enjoyed the Basilica Cistern and the Archeology museum with the Alexander sarcophagi. The museum is under renovation but still is a beautiful place to spend an afternoon. Be sure to try the simit, a sesame covered ring baked crisp on the outside and tender on the inside....addicting."

Yerebetan cistern well worth a visit. You'll need the best part of a day to get round the Topkapi palace. The displays of flowers everywhere we went were absolutely stunning - spring is definitely the best time to go.Worthwhile considering a museum pass (NB not valid for all museums - check the list.Walking from the Galata Bridge to the Galata Tower is quite a climb - you'll need a beer at the end! Tour of the Bosphorous/Golden Horn was a bit disappointing - very little historic detail from the guide so take a book with you. Our tour included a cable-car ride up to the Pierre Loti viewpoint, worthwhile, but we could have passed on the extensive lecture on the intricacies of Islamic headstones during the walk down through the cemetery."

However, in the main part of the day it is too crowded. Go at 9am or 4pm to enjoy it. The queues for the sites are very long from 11 till 3 so go either side or go with a walking tour.

Using Delightful Istanbul Tours ( www.delightist.com ) to visit the Sultanahmet and Hagia Sopia was clearly one of the best decisions we could have made. Their name is most appropriate. Emre was a \"delightful guide\". He picked us up at the airport and we went directly to the Blue Mosque. In our case we knew that during the evening hours it would be closed, but that should not stop anyone from going. Both the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque were spectacular and lit beautifully at night. Emre was profoundly knowledgeable and his English is terrific. After touring we went for dinner on Kumkapi Street: a fantastic street filled with restaurants and musicians. Very popular with locals. The fresh fish was AMAZING. The starters were also delicious. After dinner we returned to the airport all with enough time to catch our flight. We felt badly for all those people who spent the entire layover at the airport. We actually felt energized by the entire experience (even with having been on the first flight for almost 13 hours) We loved our mini excursion to Istanbul and know that we would be delighted to return. Emre created such a hospitable atmosphere, one where we never felt rushed but it was clear he kept his on the clock so we could be stress free."

Terrific local seafood restaurants along Bosphorus on Asian side.Ataturk airport clean, safe and welcoming to both, arriving and departing passengers. Food at the airport was amazing in selection and quality. Reassurance: Bathrooms, whether in hotels, airports, gas stations on the highway or public ( 1 TL per use) were exceptionally clean and well maintained in Istanbul and well beyond in Cappadocia and beyond.Tourism is a substantial contributor to Turkey's GDP, with an expected 30-million visitors this year.

I had two bad experiences with tax drivers. They charged my 20 TL from hotel to the ferry which was literally 4 minutes driving. They refused to turn on the billing monitor. Surprisingly, none of the drivers spoke English and most were ready to fight with you if you showed them your displeasure.If I asked a question, I generally found that people were misleading, pointing you in directions just to get you off their backs. Unless you speak Turkish, be prepared for a run around.Great history but the feeling that people are out for your money can take away the pleasure of such a beautiful place."

We were allowed to stay and drink it all in for as long as we liked - taking numerous photos.

Literally, buy a visa at the airport; get a metro card; take metro M1 Aksaray -Havalimani line (red) from IST (Havalimani) to Zeytinburnu metro stop. Jump on tramway T1 Zeytinburnu - Kabatas line (navy blue) to Sultanahment tram stop. (Since this second leg is a tram, bonus you get to see a good clip of the city. If return trip to airport is in evening you might get lucky as we did with a full moon. It was stunning.) Boom, you could see the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia & Topkapi Palace in one fell swoop.

Total cost for excursion (roughly): visa 20 TL, metro card with 4 transfers total 14 TL, 3 sites mentioned above 50 TL (65 TL if include Harem at Palace, highly recommended).

For me I got the Museum Pass @85 TL and valid for 72 hours from your first museum visit which saved time and money. here are my quick pointers on the main attractions:- the Basilica Cistern, the ticket is 10TL and is not covered in Museum pass, However, dont be afraid from the long queue as the line moves quickly. while at the basilica look for the wishing column and the Medusa heads. If the weather is hot, as it was when we visited, this will be a good escape from the heat.- Hagia Sophia: This is an amazing place! you can clearly see the footprints of Christianity and Islam in this Church/Mosque turned into Museum now. while there don't miss the mosaics on the upper level. it is closed Mondays, visiting hours are 09.00 and 19.00, final entry being at 18.00. ticket 25 TL but included in the Museum pass.- Blue Mosque: no shorts are allowed for men. Women need to be well dressed as well. No entrance fee.- Topkapi Palace: visit the Hareem, and the State Treasury (weaponry display). Enjoy the amazing views of the Bosphorus from the Fourth Court. Topkapi ticket 25TL, Harem ticket is 15TL. Open from 9am to 6pm. Closed Tuesday. Interesting parts were the Harem and Treasury Sections with the Spoon Makers Diamond and Topkap\u0131 Dagger."

You will be approached by people trying to tout for business, simply so no and most of them will leave you alone.

It is very easy to navigate to all the historic sites and will leave you money to spend on other things. Enjoy!"

Follow the crowd to Sultan Ahmed, Hagia Sofia, Topkapi Palace, Basilica Cistern and the Bazaar, do the usual touristic stuff. But do not forget to enjoy the city itself. There are great hangouts in Taksim, Ortakoy and Bebek. You can take a walk along Bosphorus and enjoy a nice cafe in Ortakoy or Bebek with a Bosphorus view. Taksim especially is amazing. We stayed really close to Taksim and the famous Istiklal street. With a little help from the locals at the hotel, we discovered couple of hidden rooftop bars in Taksim with a great view of the city. Although a bit expensive, Leb-i Derya Restaurant was amazing. Food was good, fusion bistro style, but the view beats it all. If you want to try local cousine, Zubeyir in Taksim is a good choice, 'Ocakbasi' style. Do not forget to try raki, may not be for everyone, but apparently goes good with the local mezes. If you want a more economical choice, you can always try the fast food places in Taksim Meydan. In general, the city is safe if you stick to the main roads. I would just watch my bags in crowded places, pickpocketing is common like in most of the touristic cities. I will definitely go back to Istanbul again. And I recommend it to everyone."

Sultanamet has all the important must of Istanbul, the Agia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi, Egyptian Column, German site, Hypodromme, Bazaar, ond so on, further down Sirkteci the historic railway station, a bit modifyed, then to Eminonou, the best \u00e1rea to see the ferries, and the typical caf\u00e9, the typical turkish boats, then to the Egyptian Bazaar, the New Mosque, back to Eminonou through the t\u00fanel to the galata Bridge and to Karakoy, the fish market...if not tired you can climb up going left to the Galata Tower, costs 6.50 euros or 19 YTL no credit card accepted. Beautiful view, better in the morning for good pictures. Evening at sunset lots of confusion, all triing to get pictures of sun set. Further above the typical Istalal street and Taksim.. for the night"

Buy an Istanbulcard (you pay 7 TL as a refundable deposit) and charge wit money. There are lots of 5star atractions (Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Yerebatan Sarani/Cistern, TopKapi palace, The grand Bazar, the Spice market, Galata Bridge wit fish restaurants, Kumkapi Fish Bazar"

            "review": "Istanbul. Recently while on my way to East Africa, I decided to stop off and to spend 5 days in Istanbul, and boy am I glad I did. As an avid traveler and history buff, I have often wondered about Istanbul, but had never had the opportunity to visit the city prior to this trip. I had however, been fortunate enough to visit some pretty remarkable places in my lifetime, but I must say, now that I have had the chance to explore Istanbul, it ranks pretty close towards the top of my favorites!I fell in love with this great city, the people and their culture. There is just no other place like it, where for millennia, East has met West and cultures and civilizations have collided. From the Roman times and Constantinople, to the Byzantine Empire and then the Ottoman, there is just no place on earth quite like Istanbul.Having done a bit of research ahead of time, I opted to stay at The Hotel Sultania. Located on the European side of Istanbul and in the Old Town, it was ideally located near many of the major sites. The Topkapi Palace was just around the corner, while The Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia were but short walks away. All three of these are must sees and do not disappoint. I highly recommend purchasing your tickets to any of these attractions well in advance however, so as to avoid extremely long lines (it will save you hours!). Also keep in mind that The Blue Mosque closes for daily prayers and you will not be able to enter during those times. Furthermore, the museums rotate which days they are closed, so be sure and check if you only have a few days so that you know how to plan accordingly. Only in Mosques are you asked to wear something to cover your head, otherwise it is not expected of you. I chose to purchase one before I left the States (from World Market/Pier One of all places), but you can easily purchase one around Istanbul (which I also did since I found them to be beautiful) or the Mosque can provide you with something. Although I am not a religious person, I found that I loved waking up in the morning to the low hum and singing of the call to prayer and did not mind covering my head in their mosques; rather I was honored they would allow us to share in some of their most sacred sites. The Blue Mosque is gorgeous inside and out and The Hagia Sophia (which is now a museum), is as well. The architecture and history of both are stunning and I will never forget how beautiful a backdrop they made against the sky. If I had had more time or better weather, I would loved to have taken a book and just spent all day there between these two giants.I would also highly recommend taking a cruise down The Bosphorus Straight. It is beautiful and will help you to better take in the incredible skyline of the city and all it's expansive bridges, buildings and homes. It also helps you to appreciate the size of Istanbul and the fact that it does expand over 2 continents.Other favorites included The Mosque of Suleyman, The Spice Market, The Grand Bizarre, The Galata Tower( for it's amazing view) and The Cistern (a 6th century underground reservoir built with Roman columns) - an absolute must. The Cistern is one of the coolest things I have ever seen and is perhaps one of my favorite places anywhere.Take the time to explore the local culture and look in all the shops. My second day there I came across this carpet and silk shop about a block away from my hotel. The second time I wandered in, the owner and his assistant invited me for some Turkish coffee and home made tea, and we sat and talked for hours on end. Halfway through we were joined by his sweet German Shepherd (who liked to be held as though he were baby), the owner's father and another customer. It was like something out of a novel and when it came time for me to go, they sent me on my way, with a lovely silk scarf - for free.Part of my favorite thing about going to any new city, is the chance to learn about a new culture and I have always found that a great way to do that is through the local neighborhood restaurants. Luckily, right outside the Hotel Sultania, the streets are littered with quaint and very authentic feeling restaurants, where carpets cover the outdoor tabletops, beautiful and colored candle holders hang from the ceiling, cats wander by to say hello and music and dancing fill the streets. I love the food while I was there and tried to eat things that were mostly indigenous to the area and I loved it all. The restaurant immediately across the alley from the Hotel Sultania was very good and another down the walkway on the left was great as well. I believe it was called The Hotel Salute Pub. While I'm not sure if that is correct, it is well worth trying to find. I stumbled in there on New Year's Eve and ended up spending a better part of the evening with the guys that worked there, who were nothing but friendly and kind. They brought New Year's things for me to wear and noise makers to use and even included me in their dancing, which would randomly break out on the cobbled streets/alleys around the restaurant. It was some of the most spontaneous fun that I have ever had. If you can find this place, please be sure and stop by. You won't regret it.Lastly, I cannot say enough my hotel. The location is unbeatable and the staff are as friendly and helpful as you could ever hope to find. Serap, who works in customer service, went out of her way to see to it that my father and I had a great trip. She booked a great Whirling Dervish show for us, showed us around the city on my map, helped with spa reservations, always checked in on us and even surprised me with a Birthday cake and gift, our last day there. Our room attendant was the sweetest man and was very attentive and thoughtful. On New Year's he left a gift for us across the beds. The hotel restaurant Olive was great on many levels, not only for the food, but on New Year's Eve, they squeezed me in, even though they were solidly booked, so that I could watch the fireworks from the roof, gave me a glass of champagne, a hat and something to wear around my waste (a la belly dancer?). The whole hotel staff was nothing short of wonderful. And the rooms were amazing to boot. While they aren't large on size, they are beautifully appointed and are luxurious enough that you feel as though you have stepped back in time and into a great Turkish retreat equipped with beautiful art work, great lighting, comfortable lounges and stunning archways.Everything about Istanbul was a delight and I cannot recommend it enough. I always felt extremely safe and the people are some of the kindest and most generous I have ever met. The culture is so rich and the city historic, and the buildings and vistas are like no other. I hadn't been gone from Istanbul a week, when I already felt as though I missed it, however odd that may sound. If you ever have the opportunity, I highly suggest getting lost in Istanbul..."

Antiquity, shopping, food attractions, warm friendly people and a sense of safety when getting around. Comparing the Turkish lire a with other currencies it is a very cheap place to visit and shop. It is a walking city so getting around is very easy but if walking is difficult the tram is convenient and easily available.Turkish people are aware of the value of tourism and the benefit if tourists. It is fun to haggle but thinking of the value of the goods in the home currency one sees the true value of the goods. Souvenirs are for tourists however look at what the country is famous for. Turkey is famous for its leather goods. The shoes and bags are very fashionable and stylish and very cheap compare to leather goods elsewhere. Looks for shoes, bags, leather gloves, men's clothing is also very cheap and very stylish.Don't forget to take the local ferry boat and go to the Asian side. Things are even cheaper and the quality is excellent. If you intend to,buy a carpet do your research and shop around for as long as time permits.Shopping in the grand bazaar is great fun but don't forget all the little arcades and lanes that are in this area. The spice market is a must and a real treat is a mackerel sandwich on the harbour . 6tl makes it a very cheap lunch.The best Turkish bath is the authentic one and not one advertised through hotels. In the old town there is one that has been operating since 1505. The old town has over 700 hotels so there are lots to choose from. They are all very competitive. The old town also has great restaurants, and some which as hidden away where the locals eat. They are the best ones and you will find them by walking around the area.One trip to turkey is not enough to enjoy all that it has to offer."

Most shops are tourists oriented.That means, over-price, not unique and great quality, souvenir loaded.Souvenirs are usually sold at higher price.Restaurants also provide more expensive food here.It is NOT an area to experience Istanbul life with real interaction with local people.My recommendation: Have your hotel outside this area. Do the shopping elsewhere. Just come here to immerse yourselves in those great heritage sites, instead of having all your Istanbul experience here."

One cure is to drive right othe fron of the Hotel and have the bellman argue with the driver. Do not put any packages in the drivers trunk for this will hinder your exit. Also, do not talk, bump into or deal with shoe shines. A favorite trick they have is they drop their brush while walking in front, so you good naturally tell them and they will not leave you alone.

Unfortunately, the guide on our day in Istanbul (via the same company) was not so pleasant and argued with several people (mainly re religion) and was downright rude to a couple who had mobility difficulties and when they could not keep up (as he did not modify his pace at all although he could certainly have done so) he told them they should not have been on the tour and should have arranged a private tour."

The ship was moored just North of the historic district so a short tram ride over the bridge got us there very fast and very cheap. (3 Lira). The historic district was packed with one attraction after the next. We arrived at the Blue Mosque just in time for prayer where we watched the men washing their feet before praying. When the Imam then called for prayer all mosques were involved. As soon as Blue Mosque stopped, Hagia Sophia started and then the next started as soon as Hagia stopped. It was like a rounder song, very eery but wonderful. People in Istanbul were very friendly and we never felt threatened once. The Grand Bazaar was so big (25.000 stalls) it could not be done in a day, especially not when you responded to the stall holders calling you in. Every time we got suckered in, we got a tea. We loved the Elma Cai, the apple tea, and I must have drunk gallons. I developed a joy in the haggling and I got two pair of leather boots for my daughter for $75.00. I was sad when the cruise ship sailed away as I would have liked to spend a lot more time in this wonderful city."

The big name hotels (Hyatt, Renaissance, Intercontinental, etc) are not near the main historic sites. They are either closer to the airport or to the business areas. If you are in Istanbul for tourism, do not stay in those hotels. They are too far away.2. The best areas to stay are near Sultanahmet or Sirkeci. You will find older or boutique hotels in those zones. Read the reviews and you will find one best suited for your needs. You do not need to spend much to have a great experience in Istanbul.3. There is so much competition (especially with all the internet reviewers) that the staff of a good hotel will do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable. If you can endure older buildings (with character!) you will have a wonderful time there."

It would be easy to discuss Istanbul in terms of the inventory of sites contained there. It is an impressive list. But to do so would neither draw an accurate picture nor do justice to the city. Istanbul, once the center of the world, bristles with mosque spires and minarets. While the inventory list would include vaunted and noteworthy sites such as the Blue Mosque, which sits next to the Hagia Sofia as though the two immense structures were locked in a stare down. They stand as two of the most beautiful buildings I've ever seen. Likewise, the Spice Bazaar, Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace, every place on our list, were stunningly impressive. But places of such historic import can burn out even the most intrepid traveller, bringing on what we called in Japan \"Temple Fatigue.\" Istanbul has a remedy for that as well; either head across the Bosphorous or to Taksim Square and Istikial Street. We did, and we saw a city that comes out to play at 10 PM and parties until 4 AM. Jammed streets, thriving restaurants, night markets, we were tempted to take on the night and dance in the sunrise. We thought better of it and took a cab home, but we know what we COULD have done; maybe next time. In another lifetime, Istanbul was a walled city. Those walls now stand as a reminder of the days when Constantinople was the center of the world. (While in the Old City, find the pillar from which all distances in the empire were measured.) We took our days offset, one neck-deep in history, the next very much in the present. Our history days were just what the guide books said and then some, so I am not detailing them here. It was the the balance of the two that made our trip as wonderful as it was."

Palaces require higher fees followed by museums & other attractions.Thus, if you are not interested in history you may skip palaces & museums. That will be a complete waste for you.

            "review": "Quick stop in. We were on our way to Germany for vacation and due to a lay-over at Ataturk decided to use the opportunity to visit Sultanahmet. Being that we were limited in time we decided to visit only a select few sights. We had our sights set on the Blue Mosque, Haga Sofia, the Basilica Cisterns and the Mosaic Museum. Unfortunately, Haga Sofia and the Museum are closed on Monday's so we were only able to visit the other two. The entrance to the Cistern is a very unassuming building and one could easily pass by it without realizing its location. We obtained a travel map from a nearby hotel desk and found it quite helpful. There will be plenty of peddlers shoving overpriced travel books in the face and we recommend avoiding those at all costs. Entrance into the Cisterns is rather inexpensive at 10 Lire ($5 US). Upon entrance to the cistern we were amazed at how large it was. We bristled a bit at the touristic atmosphere that permeated the historic cavern but we still enjoyed it very much.At the conclusion of our tour of the Cistern we headed for the Blue Mosque. Important to note, It may seem rude but the young gentlemen that are seemingly just trying to be friendly and engage in conversation are not. They are attempting to get you to visit their carpet shop. One can be either rude and nasty or just ignore. We recommend the later. This I know is difficult for many and trust me, they know this. The crowds entering the Mosque were immense, loud and pushy. Please keep in mind that even though thousands of tourists pass through the Mosque each and every day it is a place of worship and reverent prayer for many. With that in mind PLEASE be respectful of that as I am sure you would want them to be respectful of your beliefs. We were actually embarrassed some of the actions of others visitors. As day slipped into dusk we found a quiet and quaint table at the caf\u00e9 dervish which is located directly across from the Blue Mosque. Sipping Turkish Coffee and nibbling on fresh crepes while listening to the prayer callers from the Blue Mosque and Haga Sophia attempt to drown each other out is a must do. If one has a decent camera of respectable quality, waiting for a low light shot of the Mosque is well worth it as well.With our time quickly running out and with us not willing to wait another 90 minutes for the shuttle we attempted employ the services of a cab driver. IMPORTANT NOTE. When getting a cab attempt to acquire one as far away from the main square as possible. This may save you a significant amount of lire. Traffic during our return trip was at best, nightmarish. However our driver gave his very best to find the quickest route and cost ended up being 70 Turkish Lire ($35 US) that included a 10 TL tip. See you out on the trail and remember...don't be one of \"those\"John Eric"

We had a guide that we had hired over the internet for Ephesus, and arranged for him to come to Istanbul. He has been in the business for a long time, and is also a university history professor. Excellent English. We found that with a guide (there were two couples of us to share costs) we could avoid very long lines of tourists at most attractions. And, believe me, we got a lot more information. (asiltuncer@hotmail.com) Asil preferred to use public transporation - the tram - and a public tour boat for the Bosphorus to save on costs. Worked fine. l had expected the Grand Bazaar to be somewhat like the medinas in Casablanca and Marrakesh that I had visited years ago, but it was nothing of the kind. Wide lanes, permanently roofed, with rather modern shops. We had three days in Istanbul, though had also almost a full day earlier when we got on a cruise ship out of Istanbul and return. I think one can cram in everything to see in three days."

A must-see for any world traveler.This was the first time our family ages from 20's to 70's had visited Istanbul. We truly enjoyed everyday we spent in this vibrant city! As our trip was in September, there were no lines to deal with and the weather was perfect.We pre-arranged from the States a private walking tour of the Old City guided by a very knowledgeable and personable young lady from a local tourist agency. She clearly loves her city and the history that Istanbul is embodied in. She went above and beyond her responsibilities to us as her clients. She spent a great deal of time answering our many questions regarding the Aya Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Topkaki Palace, Covered Market, Spice Market, etc...We wanted to absorb the local culture as well and when our tour ended, she was able to help us see where the locals live their everyday lives. We gained a much greater understanding of the people and culture there as a result of her kindness.We had a family of six adults, one senior included. I think Topkaki Palace was worth our time, however, it might prove to be a bit long for those with young children or anyone who has a difficult time walking uphill or on inclines. To best prepare for walking in Istanbul, wear good walking shoes. If traveling with young children, older folks or those who have difficulty in walking, pre-arrange for a wheelchair, stroller, etc to make the trip easier and more enjoyable for everyone. Istanbul has many hills, inclines, cobblestone roads, etc that may prove to be a bit more challenging for some. However, these challenges can be accommodated for by planning ahead prior to arrival in the city.Each place we went, I would recommend to any person or family visiting Istanbul, as each venue is a window to peer through to gain a better understanding of what makes this city what it is today."

But, Haga Sophia is as beautiful as it is crowded. Tourists from all backgrounds, from all over the world, visited. They all understood the historic and cultural importance of this beautiful living museum/mosque. If you are traveling to Istanbul, this is arguably the most important site to visit, and it shares scenery with the equally beautiful Blue Mosque. Since it was Friday, the Mosque was closed to visitors until late afternoon, so we were unable to go inside, but that just gives us one more reason to go back!What a beautiful, crowded (over 14 million people) city!"

It is replete with history, and beautiful and amazing sites. For those who are better, more organized, travelers than I, reading up on Istanbul's history prior to the visit or concurrently with it would have, I am certain, added a dimension to my visit. I had initially decided to take it easy, and not visit too many sites in too short a period, and so I limited it to two sites a day which I would very highly recommend to readers (if any) of this review, although I know that many people's visits are limited in duration and many tourists would prefer to see everything possible in an unreasonably short amount of time. The choice of two sites/day gave me the option to extend or shorten a given visit to a site. The time left was used to walk around \"aimlessly\", seeing life as it is in Istanbul, not necessarily tourist oriented. Stopping off for cups of Turkish coffee, and sometimes glasses of beer gave the whole experience an aura of being totally unpressured. What I didn't see, I didn't see, and I don't regret it but hope to come back for another visit in the future to make up some of the things I missed. I chose a hotel in the Old City, and do not regret it. In my short visit to the New City, I realized that I was in the much better place."

At every attraction there are literally dozens of guidse willing to help you along, check the conditions first.The blue mosque plus one place in the Topkapi Palace demand decent attire so plan your trip and dress accordingly. They give out clothes for free in case the sun is too hot for you. A very good travel book will help you save a lot on audio guides and since there are many tours around it is hard not to hear what they are saying.Important: This place is of course crowded by tourist groups from all over the world. A few things are certain with them: They do not start too early, they do take a lunch break and they finish early. If you have the ability use this to your advantage.

            "review": "Cradle of Civilization. My wife and I spent about 6 days in Istanbul, staying in several different hotels, mostly in the Old City. I would say that 2/3 of what is worth seeing in Istanbul would be in the Old City. The Hagia Sofia, various mosques, cisterns, Grand Bazaar are all in a fairly compact area. Walking is a great way to get around, once you get used to very crowded sidewalks. It is a city area of small shopkeepers, no big box stores. Some streets have shops that sell nothing but wedding invitations, or streets that specialize in shoe making. Getting lost can lead to some fascinating places, and it always seemed safe. The tram that goes through the old city is a great means to get around, easy for tourists to navigate. It is also the best way to cross the Golden Horn to get to Beyoglu. This area has a different feel to it, more the jazz music store, coffee shop, high style clothing boutiques. It involves going up and down hilly streets but we are glad we spent a couple of days just exploring that area. Most Turkish speak some English so it is easy to get around.Due to the tremendous amount of history and culture in Istanbul (Turkey in general) it is really worthwhile to read up on the Byzantines and the Ottomans. One gets a lot more enjoyment from the sites if you appreciate the history behind it. Istanbul is a unique city, a little European but the Muslim influence makes it more livable I think."

The place will not be as charming if you do not understand the history behind it. Aya Sofiya has the best history and is super crowded in the morning, abt 10 - 11. Hence, you may choose to go a little later when the travel groups are leaving. For the Blue Mosque, please check the prayer times and then plan your visit. Dress appropriately - shoulders and legs covered and no tight fitting clothes. However, they do have wrap arounds to offer is you are not adhering to the dress code when you arrive - so worry not.

            "review": "Historic sites in Istanbul, Turkey quick guide and more. Just returned from a 2 week trip to Istanbul, where my son is living now, and here are some suggestions that might help visitors...even if they have a tour book.First, Istanbul is exciting, safe, with great sights to see and an amazing experience....but crowded and not without some hassles. We spent 6 days in the city, staying at a boutique hotel below the Blue Mosque and a 7 minute walk away. Need to remember that this is the most expensive area precisely because of the sights nearby and the number of tourists around here. After weeks of research we decided on the Tashkonak Hotel,a 14 room older place (they all are). Rooms in this are are all about half the size of a standard Hilton or Holiday Inn and bathrooms area are all tiny, as in most European cities. American are spoiled by these luxuries at home but here they are meant to be merely functional. However, this place was clean, comfortable and had a nice garden where tea was available. Cappucino and Turkish coffee could be made for a 2 euros. We often came back weary from walking and sat in the garden for an hour to relax, The best thing was the staff who were extremely helpful, even calling the airlines 10 times to inquire about our lost baggage. We took a taxi from the airport, about 40 TL ($20). The breakfasts were good, usual Turkish fare....fresh veggies, cheeses, bread, honey, jam, boiled eggs, fruit, olives, cooked eggplant that was wonderful etc.and the view of the Bosphorus from the terrace was nice. The best way to start a tour is to make your way to the Blue Mosque, the landmark visible from almost anywhere in this area and one needs to get one's bearings so as not to get lost, We entered the Blue Mosque form the Obelisk side and it is an amazing spectacle. Need to remove shoes and ladies need to cover their hair to enter and it is closed to visitors during prayer times (they will provide plastic bags and shawls). Outside, that entrance are some souvenir shops where we actually found some of the cheapest small gifts anywhere.Once out of the Mosque, the gate to the right is where you can see the Hagia Sophia across the square and as you make your way to it, before the fountain is the Dervis Cafe on the right. We sat here in the evening for a coffee and a chocolate crepe and listened to a musician playing that was wonderful. We saw the area at night the first time and it is one of the most memorable sights one will ever see. The Sophia can be seen during the day only and if on a tour, there is a long line for visitors. But if alone, there is al most no line at the entrance site at the front of the line and on the left where we walked in immediately to buy a ticket. It is being renovated now inside so part of it was not visible but amazing nonetheless....but full of tourists so going early is better. In the evening, recommend turning left on road past Dervis Cafe (in front of fountain), down the hill to Araasta Bazaar...the first place there is Mesale Cafe. Have something to eat or just a cup of tea or coffee and enjoy watching the locals enjoy a hookah and listen to the wonderful live Turkish music ....spent a few relaxing evenings here.Next, in the daytime, would recommend walking past the Sophia to the Basilica Cistern (turn right and then left on next street for entrance) but then go up the hill on the Cistern side where the tram runs and this is where the Turkish Delight shops, cafes and restaurants are in this area (also below the Cistern). A few doors up from the Puding Cafe is a lovely coffee shop with amazing Turkish Delight and Lokum (pomegranate/pistachio in wonderful)....there are stone steps leading down and there is a bookstore there). During the day it is the way to walk to the Burnt Column and turn right there and then left to enter the Grand Bazaar. This is a must see but also a zoo with your head spinning with all the stalls and goodies. We bought some jewelry and a small carpet after much haggling. Kilims are the geometric designed rugs and some are machine made and some hand made, and some of the rugs are beautiful. A small 3 ft X 2 ft good silk carpet will cost around ($700 -1200) but there are cheaper wool ones. Do not be pressured into seeing or buying and you have to say no politely and move on. We had an idea of what these things were worth and generally offered 50% of what they wanted, settling around 60-70% of asking price. But in the end, if you like it and want something. paying a little more than is OK...as long as it is cheaper than in the US. We bought semi precious necklaces, evil eye bracelets etc.....all costume jewelry and reasonable. Would not buy diamonds here or gold, unless an expert.The other bazaar that is a must is the Spice Bazaar near the New Mosque and the ferry at Eminonu. Get to it by walking in the opposite direction down the hill past Sophia to the end and turn left. The Mosque is beautiful and the courtyard behind leads to the Spice Bazaar. The shops have wonderful stuff and if you go left and out the streets around have interesting stalls and goods.We then walked to the Galata Bridge, opposite the Mosque. next to which are boats selling famous fish sandwiches. Fresh pomegranate and orange juice is available everywhere and we could not resist several glasses a day but there is a vendor across the bridge who had the best price. Turn left after the bridge and walk up towards the Tower....we did not go in, there was a long line, but after the square there turn right on Istiklal Ave that is the modern main street that is visited by 3 million people daily and leads to Taksim Square after a mile. We did not find this area of great interest and preferred to wander off on the small side streets, Returned taking the funicular and the tram (need to get a token at the machine at the station).The Topkapi is a must see and again, go early and avoid a Sunday, when locals congregate. The Treasury is on the right as one enters and opposite is the hall with the Sacred Relics (no tank tops and minis allowed)....with some beautiful objects. On the way to the washrooms (between the 2 halls) we stumbled on the Konyali restaurant (the other is a cafeteria adjacent) and had a wonderful rest and break for lunch watching the other side (Beyoglu) and the ships going in and out. Opposite the ticket office is the Harem (we did not visit and not a must see, I am told (of course not, if there are no ladies there!)) but the Privy Council and Clock Room next door are worth a visit. Best way to Topkapi is to face the Sophia and go all the way to the right where there is a wall and turn left to gate and entrance.A must is the roasted chestnuts the vendors sell everywhere (but the corn is not that great).Food: we are not great meat-eaters and this is pretty much the standard fare, in various forms. My son eats about a pound a day so we generally sampled his food. We really liked the lentil soup and lahmacun (thin crust pizza with meat or veg and cheese toppings and cheap), salads and Isme (a mixed veg appetizer). Pide is thicker crust pizza with the edges folded in and cheese inside.....too much bread for me. BUT, the fresh breads are lovely, from the Simit (donut shaped with sesame and a little hard like a bagel) to the french bread and other varieties. Most tourists will not venture here for lack of time but we went to the Asian side (Kadikoy) by ferry and spent 3 nights here and loved it. Less tourists and more locals. If you go for even a day, it is worth it....turn right after leaving the ferry and where the main street is with the train tracks, turn left and then right at the second street.....this whole area is filled with restaurants, sweet shops, fishmongers, etc and a great spot to have Turkish coffee and try a hookah. We walked through to the main street and all the way to fashionable Moda and had lunch at the Moda pier, a nice scenic spot. It was convenient for us to stay here as we were leaving for Cappadocia from SAW airport, 40 mins south by Havatas shuttle (next to ferry). Stayed at My Dora Hotel....clean, modern but very small rooms. Nice breakfast and opposite ferry.Any visit to Turkey would be incomplete without a visit to Cappadocia, a fairyland place with amazing sights and history. We landed in Kayseri and had arranged a shuttle through the Heybe Hotel (could have picked a cave hotel but were concerned with heat and claustrophobia) and this was a clean and modern place. We just loved the town of Goreme, full of fairy chimneys all around, a lovely main street and great restaurants. The Goreme restaurant is a must as a musician plays traditional music at night, you sit on pillows on the ground and we ordered a dish cooked in a clay pot.....opened by the owner breaking it with a flourish with a dagger. And the beef stew with veg was very tasty. We visited the Open Air Museum (long walk but the hotel shuttle took us), really incredible sight of churches and cave homes made by hermit monks by carving them out of the mountains. Visited Love Valley and Peshabag to see the fairy chimneys and worth seeing. We took the Green Tour the next day and this is well worth it....visited Derinkuyu, the underground city of 8 levels where early Christians carved a massive city underground to escape attacking armies...an incredible sight and experience. And then went to Ilhara Canyon for a lovely walk and lunch, ending with a visit to the Selime cliff monastery. Lovely view of the area and fairy chimneys on the way back. We did not take the recommended balloon ride over the area as did not fancy the ride but most say it is well worth it. The sights are so unique that this actually became the highlight of our whole trip.2 days minimum needed here.We then took a 4 hour bus trip to Konya, just to see the Rumi museum and it was on the way to Antalya so a good stopping point. Buses are clean and comfortable....and cheap. We stayed at the Hilton Garden, a 10 min walk for the museum. Crowded as it was a Friday, but the museum was very interesting. Nothing else much in Konya as I expected to see some of the old city....but now just shops and restaurants around the museum, so that was disappointing. Great hotel and breakfast there.Then took a bus to Antalya....really to see Kaleici. the old city and then on to Cirali on the beach for 2 days rest. Loved Kaleici....very touristy but the old narrow cobblestoned streets with shops and restaurants with views of the harbor were great. Stayed at Aspen Hotel.....convenient location. The rest of the city is like any other but should walk around this area and the Park along the harbor.We then rented a car and drove one hour to Cirali on the beach.....crowded in summer and very hot but weather in late Sept. was good....though water was cold. Driving was easy but gas prices are double what they are in the USA (rental was reasonable though (through economycarentals.com). Stayed at Anatolia Resort which was very nice, had dinner there two nights. We walked up to the Chimaera flames late one night (absolutely need a good flashlight and good shoes and be careful as can be treacherous, especially coming down) but an amazing sight to see these flames spouting out from the ground as they have been for thousands of years. On our return, stopped for lunch at Kemer, a nice town with a pleasing harbor and lunch spots.Then returned to IST for 2 nights to end our vacationThere are many other places to visit...Bodrum, Izmir, Kusadasi, Pammukale and one has to decide which is a priority. But would recommend not trying to do too much as the country is large and travelling takes time and a toll. Suggest spending a couple of days in each place and resting before moving on.ANd just a note....not all places in smaller towns or out of the way restaurants have western style toilets. Always keep some TP with youHope this is helpful."

Many of the main sites are free. Unbelievable amount of big tour buses which impacts the overall experience. Would recommend to visit outside of the summer season otherwise you will be queuing to get into the main attractions and even walking from one place to another can be frustrating due to the volume of people around. One tip, go to the rooftop terrace of the Blue Hotel late afternoon and listen to the call to prayer while watching the sun go down on the mosque - beautiful. There are a huge amount of cats and dogs that live on the streets which are in the most part tolerated and well looked after by the locals. The dogs are tagged and are medically clean and the cats are super friendly - great extra for animals lovers. Overall great atmospheric experience and felt very safe walking around both day and night."

Hot Tip:- Asian side of Istanbul ---- The Best!!!!Beyond Istanbul - Alexander the Great, Emperor Hadrian, St Paul, Mevlana. One of the great countries to visit for a big time history fix. I was gobsmacked by the antiquity that lies within the borders of Istanbul. Once you get over that, the people, the culture, the place and the food just make this wonderful place one of the best places to experience and ingest into your life experience something that is very unique. i.e.. not available elsewhere.Please don't take me too seriously, because we are going back next year and probably the year after to finish what we have started and don't want any more tourists making it even harder for us to get around. Except for the hardcore traveller like us, go for it, don't miss one moment of this fabulous place.We are going back, next year and hopefully the following year and then again! So, do go there until 2015. Much appreciated.Turkish west coast - magnificent. Kannakale - a wonderful stay. Gallipoli, an experience I'm kind of glad I've done. I found my time there tough going, only helped a little by the enormous number of Turkish people coming to mourn their loved ones. It was their country to defend after all, but I didn't realise how many Turkish soldiers were lost in defence of their homeland, particularly how young they were (some only 15) - How Wrong is That!Going there, the place does have an atmosphere. Even now writing this from my home in Melbourne, I can't help but be overcome by the emotion of the place. I didn't want to do it. Glad I did. I've digressed from the original intent here.If you can - go to Istanbul. If you can spend two weeks soaking up te vibe in this amazing city. In many ways still the hope to bring East & West together. If that doesn't happen, just go out and discover all the amazing things about this city before it changes. If you have the time to go beyond Istanbul, do not hesitate - explore - the enrichment you can experience is only a function of how much time you have to explore!! Mark my words - The richness of your experience will be unmatched by many countries.Sorry for the rambling commentary, but I only realised I may be adding to my contributions on Tripadvisor."

We did catch the tram, vernicular rail and a ferry to see Taksim Square and the harbour but again this was an easy task with a guide. One suggestion we would make is to obtain a decent travel book on Turkey before you go and prepare a must see and hope to see list. It's a city of some 15 million people and at times we thought most were at the same venue as us, but that's all part of the fun especially in the Grand Bazzar"

The positive review comments about the place are spot on. The history, the architecture, the sites and sounds, the landscape, the friendly people, not to mention, in my humble opinion, the best cuisine in the world all conspire to make this city a \"must see\" to anyone who calls themselves a traveller. Make sure you purchase the 72 hour valid museum pass to by-pass the long queues that form outside the main attractions. Sadly it does not cover every site you might want to visit but the main ones such as Tokapi, Hagia Sophia, St Saviour in Choro plus others are certainly included. Blue Mosque is free to enter,"

The fellas managing it mentioned to purchase tickets to the main attractions online to bypass the long queue at the entrance. This saved me alot of time at Ayya Sophia and Topkapi Palace. There is also a muzekart pass that is electronic and has unlimited entry over several days so this can be useful to some passionate ppl who enjoy taking their time at some of these sites.A good way to get a sneak preview of what the city has to offer is with the \\hop on hop off bus, once after that route you can plan where to visit and what my interest you better.On a personal note, i find Dolmabache Palace is alot more regal & significant compared to Topkapi Palace if you have to choose between these 2 palaces. If one has to get souvenirs there are some cheaper stalls on the way to the Grand bazaar from Ayya Sofiya via the basillica cistern, its easier to bargain { Indirim means discount; mention that and it will stun some turks & get them to lower their rates }.The grand bazaar is a unique place but rather stressful to deal with some store owners, most stalls sell similar items after awhile.In general, the local turks have mention that some Hamams in Istanbul are pretty dirty, so you might wanna try em out elsewhere."

This city is huge, but unlike most cities, it's pretty much 'low rise', with the city sprawled across hills and dales for miles and miles. Much of the historic areas are within a small (ish) area, which is handy, and there's plenty to see here, even if you do have to walk or take a tram as the traffic is so awful. Take time to walk the old quarter though as its amazing, mosque after mosque and palace after column are all there to see, and don't miss the Hippodrome either, or what's left of it. This is an amazing city and a must see, especiallly at sunset when everything looks twice as good. Also take a trip on the Bosphorous, the large body of water that runs between the Black sea and the mediteranean if you can, we ran out of time so book it when you get there. Hope this helps"

Istambul is one of those fascinating cities that are so completely distant from our western reality and way of life that it will leave a mark for the rest of your life. You must remember you are in a muslim country where certain rules (specially for foreigners), are a MUST.Women MUST be completely covered at all times. If not usually men pass by and rub you arms even give you a boot in your behind and some even go as far as rubbing breasts. If you respect this then you will have a great time.There are so many things to visit an see in this city that it's difficult to advise as to the order of things.ONE WORD OF ADVISE YOU HAVE TO TAKE. The Bazar and Egyptian (spice market) are an obligated visit JUST BE VERY VERY CAREFUL. To give you an idea as to the Bazar, the people selling you speak tens of languages and not only that they distinguish form where you are coming. For example if you speak spanish they know if you are from spain or central or south america. Many times they know exactly from what country you come even the region within the country (specially Spain), according to your \"accent\". Well this is crucial because depending where you come from is the price you get and they know you will pay. For example if you come from Spain you get a MUCH cheaper price than if you come from Mexico because spanish tourists in Turkey as seen as \"Cheap\" where as if you come from Mexico you have to have money just to get there. The same goes to almost every language in the planet. So be very, very careful they are the best negotiators on the planet. The Spice market is difficult because they will do just about anything to rip you off, Fore example I tried to purchase a Can of Beluga Caviar. I was offered a taste of an opened can every time I mentioned my intent. I was always given a can that loss EXACTLY like Iranian Beluga Caviar even with the government seal. I would opened the can that was given to me saying that if it was the same I tasted I would pay for it and IT WAS NOT. It was a cheap imitation. this happened over 35 times in 35 different vendors. In other word go as a tourist purchase very cheap touristy things and thank yourself for not falling for a trick that is as old as the country.Meuseums are incredible to visit. it was one of the greatest empires in human History. There is so much to see and so much to visit I would either pick hilights of everything or dedicate to one specific theme and stick to it.Awesome city, women MUST be aware of dress code EVERYWHERE, and INCREDIBLE culture."

The main tip is don't be afraid to say no and walk away - but be polite about it.The Bazaar sees stalls helpfully group in sections for silver, leather, pashminas etc. So you can compare prices. An Istanbul resident told me the starting price is usually 30-40% inflated - so that is a helpful guideline. In the spice market some stalls are clearly marked \"ticket price\" or \"fixed price\" - so you know they won't haggle.Go with a friend if possible if only for moral support!"

We ate at a seafood restaurant at the end of the public Bosphorous Ferry ride. This is where the Bosphorous enters into the Black Sea in Istanbul. Fantastic food way out of the city....on the water.

Time was just enough to see a lot, but not everything, so we want to come back and repeat experiance but also explore more. We were exploring city during the day, which was our aim, so we can not say a thing about nightlife. We booked hotel Agan in Sultahmet area, few minutes distance from Gulhane tram station (perfect location and choice).We used perfect Istanbul public transport. Right at the airport I bought Electronic card for public transport and refilled it with 40 TL. 6 metro stations and 17 tram station and we are at our hotel. I highly recommend Istanbul public transport which is very inexpensive, comfortable and best way for getting around.First day we bought Museum Card, 72 TL. We used it for Archeological Museum, Topkapi Palace and Harem, Haghia Sofia and Mosaic Museum. It is not valid for Basilica Cistern and Dolmabasce Palace, which are the \"must see\". Next time I wouldn't go for this card but for seperate tickets. It is hard to visit all cites that Museum Card is valid for in 72 hrs.Day 1 - arrival day. After settling in hotel, we walked around - Gulhane Park, Eminonu, bought Turkish Delight, had dinner at the restaurant.Day 2 - Archeological Musem, Topkapi Palace with Harem. Next time I would dedicate 1 day for Museum, 1 for Topkapi. To much to see, admire, enjoy...Day 3 - Haghia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Hipodrome, Basilica Cistern, Mosaic MuseumDay 4 - Bosphorus tour.We took ferry from Eminonu and went to Anatolu Kavagi (less than 2 hrs trip, last stop on Asian side). Round trip is 25 TL. Takes 30 min to climb to the fortress from Bizantine period. And there -breathtaking view. Nice restaurants on the way. upon return we went to Taxim by public transport ( I should mention that all before we did by foot). Galata Tower.Day 5 - Dolmabahce Palace, Spice market, Blue Mosque again, Suleyman MosqueDay 6 - checked out, went to airport, left laguage there and than went to Forum Istanbul Shopping Mall by metro and visitet aquarium.Every day was a new wonderfull experience. We will definitely going back.This trip was not expensive either: less than 500 Eur per person incl hotel, transport (public), entance fees, meals and refreshment, even some souvenirs.You must add air ticket.I love Istanbul."

Also you can find Bosphorous tour and Golden Horn tour ferries here.If you want to go to Prince Island, just use the Tramway and go to \"Kabatash\" (about 15 minutes), there will be several different ferries to Prince Islands and also other parts of the town (also you can reach \"Dolmabahche Palace\" from \"Kabatash\" by 10 minutes walking).Have fun."

If you stay in Sultanahmet area (I particularly recommend any hotel on the street Akbiyik Caddesi) then you are within 10-15 minutes walk of 75% of the major sights, plus you're close to the Sultanahmet Tram stop for if you want to go further afield. Trams are easy to use, very modern and very frequent. If you're only there for a few days don't bother with the Travel Card, just buy Tram tokens (they're currently 3 Lira for unlimited distance).We only experience queues when visiting Hagia Sofia (this was around noon because we'd already done Blue Mosque first). We had to queue for about 20 minutes to buy tickets, and then another 20 minutes to actually get in, but I didn't mind, because Hagia Sofia is truly amazing when you consider how old it is. The queue for Topkapi Palace wasn't bad, just a few minutes, but once inside there were 15-20 minute queues for each of the major attractions such as the Treasury, so we did give them a miss, and enjoyed the harem tour instead. BEFORE YOU GO : do search the Internet and print the latest public transport map for Tram and Metro. The ones in the guide books are 3-4 years out of date, and they have been doing some amazing building work. We got completely lost near Taksim Square entering the wrong metro station and needed a taxi to get back to Golden Horn. Even the maps at some of the tram stops etc aren't up to date, and there's more lines and stations opening in 2014-2015."

The mixture of traditional Islamic architecture with Byzantine elements is dazzling and spectacular. My husband and I had so much exploring all those side streets filled with cafes and shops in Sultanahmet, visiting the historical buildings and mosques, and we didn't have enough. We will go back to this lovely city."

Away from them there are small cafes, bazaars and markets in the side and backstreets that give you a true local flavour in every sense. Get walking but with a good, detailed map and explore.

Watch out for the carpet salesman that offers you a 'great view at sunset from the top floor.\" We got out of a stressful situation by dropping highly placed people. The second came from a taxi guy that operated outside the rules (he was not at the stand). He quietly turned on the radio to a frequency and then sadi that the station number was the fee. Instead of 25.00, it was 43.50. We handed him a 50 and he took it, turned away from us and then turned back to say I had given him a 5. He got extremely mad. We gave him the additional 50 and he had the nerve to ask for a tip. The third con was from a shoe shine guy that 'accidentally dropped his brush in front of us. When we picked it up to give it to him, he was so grateful that he offered to shine my shoes as a thank you. Afterwards he demanded 18 liras. Outside of these three incidents, the sites, the food, the climate was fantastic. A visit to the Nardis jazz club and the Sirevi restaurant were the icing on the cake for an enjoyable visit."

The matter is for visitors that are in Istanbul for few hours during a cruise stop and prefer to avoid shore excursions organised by the cruise ship.The harbour is not so far from city center but a taxi is highly recomended. Close to the pier only taxis for half day/day sightseeing are available...then you have to walk outside to get another one., Try to stop a taxi that runs along the main road... it's the only way. I've been in Istanbul several times but I never managed to find a cab driver who could speak english. If you are in Istanbul with plenty of time, you won't find a problem but if you are there for few hours only, you need to remember that things may not always be easy and/or fast. Not all taxi drivers get euros (10 euro to get to Haghia Sofia from Istanbul port) and won't stop for tourists and Most of them prefers tourists who pay for a tour and not for a drive. Sometimes it takes a lot of time because many of they won't let you get on their taxi. Traffic can be awful and in the busiest days you'll have to queue a lot for tickets for main sites. You can't pay with foreign currency, therefore go to a moneychanger or use yr cc but remember that not all counters accept cc and when you'll get to a wrong one you'll have to queue again ...The Bazaar is great but, if you are more than 2/3 people or travelling with children, remember that it's easy to get lost and even the turistic policemen usually can't speak english.In the morning get off the ship as soon as possible and give yourself plenty of time to visit the town because in Istanbul it's easy to waste time queuing or in a traffic jam or to find a cab.When we were there in April, the ship left with 30 min delay as they had to wait some buses (ship shore excursions) that were late due to the traffic..."

            "review": "Tips for travel in Istanbul. My tips while you travel in Istanbul:1. If you are booking an apartment, which is not through a reputed web-site, be very careful, the pictures are far from reality. The apartment we booked stank, the shower cabin leaked, the bed fell apart.2. Take the orange taxi from the Airport, or if yellow, look for the Government approved taxis (with the licence number on the door of the driver).3. If you want to exchange money, change just enough for the taxi and other immediate expenses at the airport. 4. Exchange rates are best in Aksaray, Laleli - Univeristy and Beyazit areas (Grand Bazaar).5. Trams are good for exploring Istanbul. Most sites are located on the T1 Tram route of Istanbul. You can buy the ticket by investing 7 TL for the Istanbul card and then topping up money on the card from time to time. That way, you spend only 1.95 TL per trip as opposed to 3.50 TL, without the card. Many people can use the same card.6. There are quite some restaurants and Cafes in the Beyazit area (in the street opposite the Grand bazaar). They are tasty and cheaper as compared to Sultanahmet.7. While ordering, the restaurants often charge you for bread, service charges per person, water,etc. Ask before they serve you. 8. Also, sometimes, they trick you by charging you for 2 portions, instead of 1, by later claiming that it was a bigger plate. They tried doing that to us in the 'Istanbul restaurant' in Beyazit. They also offered a 10% discount on the menu flyer, which they conveniently denied, later.9. Grand bazaar is overpriced. For small souvenirs, look for the row of shops behind the Sulaimaniye mosque. They are reasonably priced. Being the University area, cafes are also cheaper."

You need a plastic bag for your shoes and ladies need to cover arms, legs and heads. A scarf and makeshift skirt are provided if you don't have your own. You can wear long trousers.

Its worse on weekends when domestic tourists are also present. If you do take the tram because you are tired of walking, be aware that the trams are jam packed full most of the time and therefore not a good choice if you have claustrophobia. If you get pestered by salesmen and shopkeepers or restaurant owners/waiters, its best to ignore them and just to keep on walking. This may seem rude but it is the only way to deal with them.

An amazing city to visit with its rich history from Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Galata Tower, Grand Bizaar and the diversity of people that converge whereby the saying of East meets West was coined. You will be surprised, breathless and left wanting more. You can either; walk around (for the true die hard walkers) bus with the hop on tours, taxi or take the bright red tram down Istiklal street. There are plenty of coffee shops and eateries along the way. If you want to try a traditional Turkish coffee do visit their coffee and smoke houses. Definetly a city that has to be visited more than once."

Sadly, it is inhabited by residents whose only goal seems to be separating tourists from their money by any means necessary. Disappointing. Cabbies in Sultanahmet are the best (and most brazen) example of the thievery that is commonplace in the Istanbul tourist business. Solution: The Old City is a great area (and Istanbul is a great city) to see by one of the many tours that are offered. I usually hate those things, but Istanbul is not a place to see on your own (not much English, and Turkish is largely impenetrable). Don't worry about missing the \"real\" historic Istanbul. There is NOTHING in the Grand Bazaar that you won't find in every other souvenir shop in Istanbul. Staying across the Golden Horn in Pera, and just touring the Old City, will enable yo to see as much as you want, while avoiding the pressure sales and ripoff artistry that seems to have saturated the surrounding areas."

So many sights are within walking distance of each other that you can easily wander from place to place at your own pace. It is in competition for 2020 Olympics evidenced by the many banners and signs displayed. I didn't see many homeless which is typical in most large areas.Everything is very accessible. Most signs are translated in English also. Most everyone is very helpful and if they aren't fluent in English they know enough to be helpful.The written Turkish language at first looks impossible but after learning a few grammar lessons and pronunciation rules I was able to survive. The language is basically phonetic. For example taxi is taksi. Now is really a perfect time to travel to Turkey. The weather in Istanbul is moderate similar to Northern California. Took a trip southeast to Cappadochia and was enchanted by everything, it is truly a historical wonderment. A balloon ride is a must to enjoy the fairy chimney rock formations. I loved exploring the countryside and learning the ancient history of this area and traveling down 5 stories of a 15 story underground city! The food is very tasty while not being over hot spicy.I felt very safe as a middle aged single female traveler."

Some antiques but feeling there is you will be ripped off. Beware of the taxi scams, start the meter before you get in the tell you 55 lire and if you give 55 they switch the 50 for a 5 and tell you that you made a mistake, happens all the time. If you feel cheated, go to the hotel (they will try to drop you off early blaming traffic) and have them call the door man deal with it! I was here 3 days and tried to happen 3 times. Also, beware at Blue Mosque of carpet salesmens possing as free guides, just say no as they will give you a quick tour and then you end up in some carpet store with high pressure sales people making you feel bad! Again, do not take any quidance from these touts and they are good at convincing you!"

The historic district of Istanbul with Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, The Grand Bizzar and so much more is amazing. I travel a great deal and I tell my friends they really need to vacation in Turkey, starting with Istanbul. With great rates, especially off season, more Roman Empire ruins than anyplace of earth, including Rome, and with inexpensive airline tickets from major US airports, Turkey is hard to beat. I feel more safe on the streets of Istanbul, day and night, than I do in any large US city. Your purse can get snatched or pocket picked if you are not careful. I believe reliable data demonstrates more serious crime is very rate. Carpet and tour salesmen can be an annoyance in the historic district. The pitch is, in my experience usally the same and goes like this:\"where are you from?\" answer \"Oh, I have an uncle in ______\" ...\"is this your first time to Istanbul?\" answer \"My uncle has a carpet shop just down the street, come and look, you don't have to buy....\" I have found a polite \"not interested\" and walking away to be perfectly acceptable."

While the West was sorting through feudalism enroute to the enlightenment, Istanbul shone as the center of learning and culture in the world. The buildings they made were incredible, and all reachable on a two day walk - Haiga Sofia (for a milennia the largest religious place in the world); Topkanapi Palance, Blue Mosque, the Roman forum area with even older Egyptian monolith, and the Solomon mosque. I am not Muslim, but the beaty of these mosques is awe inspiring in the original sense of the word. Galata tower across the Bay, a key domestic and invader watchtower, is also worth a morning visit to miss the crowds (guides help with that local knowledge a lot). Don;t miss the Gran Bazaar just for the scale and scope; and the Spice Bazaar becuase after the Grand Bazaar it is easy to deal with.We used a guide through a travel service, and it was well worth it for not just the knowledge but also the logisitics.My family is older now - three \"children\" aged 18-26 plus my wife and I.

The salesmen try to get you to look at their wares but they were not as overly aggressive as I had been led to believe. There are too many people there for them to bother everyone.We also went to see the Whrling Dervishes. While it was somewhat interesting I would not go again.

Make sure you wear socks or tights for visits to mosques as you'll have to remove your shoes, as I found to my cost, it can be very disconcerting if you're barefoot! No short skirts and a headscarf is mandatory. Watch out for the carpet sellers. However, if you're looking for a beautiful, exotic and unusual carpet then this is this the place to be! You can, if willing to haggle, get them to reduce by up to 50%! The Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, Topkapi palace, Sulaymaniyah mosque, the Grand Bazaar, the Hippodrome, the Spice bazaar and Bascillica cistern are all amazing, but there are so many other places such as the Jewish District, the Florence Nightingale museum and the Mosaic Museum not to be missed, it needs a visit of at least 10 days. If you are taking children with you they'll enjoy a trip to the Miniaturk which is a wonderful museum which has a huge miniature village of Turkey's cultural landmarks, a children's park and, for the summer, a pool! People are friendly and the food a gastro delight. Try it!!"

Do your research and decide what you want to see and make the best use of your time. It's important to get to places where there are queues early. Watch out for preyer times as it is impossible to shop, or see some attractions at these times. Visitors need to be respectful of different religious and cultural influences and to cause offence due to not covering up. This is a city and not a beach resort so you need to dress appropriately. It's easy to get ripped off so keep your wits about you, check prices and barter. They do try and confuse you in many places by quoting euro, lira and dollars , so get a calculator if your maths is not good. I recommend you get a map as it is easy to get lost down the side streets. Alcohol, especially wine is expensive so beware if you are a drinker - you will need deep pockets. You can eat cheaply and safely on the street stalls and there are also some amazing upmarket restaurants."

I never once saw another tourist and didn't have to deal with traffic.And free Apple tea for the ride.I'd say you need minimum 1/2 day for Topkapi Palce in off-season, when I was there in December, half day was not enough to take in such opulence, which I have never even imagined! Bowls full of polished emeralds the size of your fist! Everything covered in presious stones, I mean everything! I had no crowds but had been told that in-season the wait to get into some parts of the palace can be hours. Same with Bluw Mosque, so I'm glad I was there off-season,,decent weather and lower prices, too!If someone approaches you on the street to but expensive perfumes, DONT. I promise you even though the packaging looks good, it is just colored water. Another scam to avoid in Sultanhamet are the \"authentic\" Turkish nights,very much hyped by the local travel agencies- super-expensive,very sad food and terrible, I mean TERRIBLE show. I've seen more talented and engaged performers at elementary school talent shows. The local travel agencies also sell the hell out of their Bosphorus cruises. I did both the travel agency cruise for about $50.USD and the local one you can buy at the docks at Eminounou for about $8.USD. I do have to say I met a lot of interesting people on the travel agency cruise.Just a GREAT adventure, also loved Cappadoccia, well worth the trip. If I had a choice between Cappadoccia and Ephesus, after trips to both, I'd go with Cappadoccia."

Most tourist attractions are located in the old town, which is surrounded on 3 sides by the sea. We chose a hotel that was in the old town, this enabled us to reach all the sights on foot."

Give yourself half a day just to go to the Topkapi - go into every nook and cranny and as all the guide books suggest to the very popular Harem first. (It's a big pity that the audio guide and the signage doesn't explain far more about living conditions, food, clothes, how you were chosen etc, etc.. for the harem because it is such an extraordinary place.One tip. Don't pay for their ridiculously expensive coffee in their coffee shop. It's simply a rip-off and with building works going on it doesn't even have a view.The Grand Bazaar is worth almost a day. It is endless. I loved it and had great fun with all the traders who will ask you to haggle but back off immediately when you politely tell them you're not interested. My favourite comment from one carpet seller was 'Come on (to his shop) - it's ALMOST free!'The Spice Bazaar can be visited in an hour but its worth hanging around for more because it's not LIKE the Middle Ages - it IS the Middle Ages. Frenetic activity as local people do their real shopping. Fabulous.The list of things to do is endless."

I am an Artist, a painter, so I guess the incredible and stunning visual beauty of the city in all it's sometimes disheveled glory is almost overpowering. The sense of human history is palpable as you walk it's streets, somehow more so than even in Rome!- perhaps the vitality of this place, twenty million people, 60% under thirty, is what does it. The economy is booming here, things change from week to week, yet the Ancient is everywhere at hand, the eternally changeable and beautiful Bosphorus infusing everything with its presence.  Another reviewer wrote something about all the \"homeless\" animals roaming the streets- I would argue that they are home, their home is Istanbul! I have been alot of places where \"feral\" animals are starving and malnourished, including my home, NYC, USA, but I have yet to see a starving or mistreated cat or dog on the streets of this city. I know that the Prophet Muhammed liked Cats, so that might be part of the reason, but whatever the reason, they all seem quite well taken care of. In any case, if you are thinking of coming to this amazing city, and you have a sense of history and an interest in the Human Story, don't think twice about it, just come."

Go, do not hurry, enjoy.Tip: check opening hours and days the main attractions are available. It is sometimes to get up early and go to entrance of the given place before they open - like in Topkapi - after 9 the queques are horrible both to main entrance as well as to Harem.Take a boat cruise on Bosphorus.

You will have to consider major cultural capitals such as Rome or Paris to find an equal number of attractions, good cuisine and lovely views. The historic area is perhaps a bit vague in definition but I take it to mean the area within the old city walls from the 5th century, maybe with the addition of Galata. Anyway this is where you find Top Kapi, the major mosques, Hagia Sofia, the great bazaars etc. It's easy to get around on foot or with tram no 1. It was not a noisy disorganised place as I thought it might be but very pleasant. Mind you I didn't see all parts of it. I can recommend choosing a hotel between Hagia Sofia and the Kennedy boulevard. This is a quiet and very central location."

Sultanahmet, which has its own listing, is just an incredible neighbourhood to walk around. You can feel the history, and the architecture is awe-inspiring. However, the area is very busy and touristy.The same thing can be said for Grand Bazaar, which I suggest you visit once. After this take a walk towards the Spice Bazaar. The area in-between these bazaars is great and much cheaper than each of the bazaars.Walking outside all of the above mentioned touristy areas is even nicer in my opinion. The streets are still alive and busy but with more locals, store owners don't bother you, and everything is much cheaper."

We're Americans and grew tired of well meaning people asking us \"Is it safe?\" \"Aren't you afraid?\" To be honest it was a wonderful experience to be in a country that does NOT force you to listen to Christmas music blaring from every corner. The history embraced within Istanbul is well worth seeing. The architecture is a refreshing change from other countries we have toured with its tall spiraled turrets and fascinating domes. The tile work and mosaics are extraordinary. Historic sites were reader friendly as all have English plaques beside the Turkish ones. December was a great time as the crowds were kept manageable. The merchants were very friendly and we enjoyed the fresh pomegranate juice stands and roasted chestnuts grilled on most corners. Go see Istanbul, enjoy her wonderful culture and connect with her most precious treasure of all ...her people. We felt very much welcomed and appreciated for choosing this as our holiday destination."

There are lines to buy tickets, which is to be expected, but the lines continued. Bummer however that no brochure or guide map us given w entrace fee of 25TL. Then after you buy ticket you get into another line that is even more crazy. There were 100's, if not 100's of people trying to get into the castle. There was no line formation or snaking of lines just a mob of prople trying to get into the palace. To make matters even worse there were just as many people trying to leave the castle through the same 10' entry way. People were pushing and shoving - it was mot at all enjoyable. Once we were in it was a little better but not much. There us still one mire major insanity line to get into the Third Palace. That was the worst. I cant imagine what it is like on a busy summer day with hest beating down on people. I could think if 5 quick ways to make the experience better fir all visitors. Being here left me depressed about fellow travelers as well. Many cut in lines or stoid in front of displsys, listening to thier interpertation devises (another 15TL) instead of moving along. If course in the end Im glad we went but it was frustrating."

We had a private van as there were six of us and it was a wonderful way to tour the city. Driving in Istanbul is not for the faint-hearted.

You can do most of these on one day, if the Q's aren't too long. Make sure you dress appropriately for the visits to the religious sites, no shorts, spaghetti straps, halter tops etc... And remember you have to remove your shoes when you enter the mosque. I appreciated that the sites are concentrated so closely together, you can easily walk between them. There are numerous restaurants, shops and hotels to suit every budget in the old city. What's there not to like? So rock up and enjoy one of the most exotic cities straddling Europe and Asia. "

Prices are a little higher in this area, but I guess it is normal in the touristic heart of a big city! Ali Pasa Medresesi, which is a little square hidden, just in front of the Grand Bazaar. You can find a couple Nargile (water pipe) bars where you can chill, smoke Nargile and have a Turkish tea or coffee for a normal price.The local market, next to the Egyptian Bazaar... you will find the same spices and products for way less money! F.e. bought 1 kg of meat spices for 18 lira, instead of 100 lira at the bazaar!The street food is extremely good... no matter where you go, you keep on eating all day around... prices are good.The Mosques are beautiful and worth a visit... so is the Topkapi Palace.Negative:In my experience, people in general are NOT friendly... they do not care of the tourists, the only thing they care of is how to get money from your pocket!! They appear to be friendlier when purchasing something... People hardly speak English, which makes it difficult to communicate... I find this stange for the most touristic area of town, this also tells me that they don't give a sh\u00a1t about tourists. "

Our cruise started in Istanbul but they didn't have any days set aside to see it so we went a couple of days early. We ended up staying an extra day since our cruise was delayed because of Hurricane Sandy.What got us interested in Istanbul was watching The Great Courses tape - \"The Great Tours: Greece and Turkey, from Athens to Istanbul\". It's available on DVD and I'd highly recommend it to anyone considering a trip to the Aegean Sea. Professor John Hale is great!He did an excellent job introducing Istanbul but it's really surreal to be there. It's so beautiful,very vibrant, and clean.We stayed at The Seven Hills Hotel. It's right in the heart of the old town within easy walking distance to all the main attractions. It has a roof top restaurant with unbelievable views of the Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, and the Bosporus. The service in the hotel was excellent and the room was very spacious. The restaurant has great seafood. If you're looking for gourmet food all you have to do is walk across the street to the Four Season Hotel. The food was great there but it seemed a little sterile to us as far as staying there - plus the Seven Hills' views are much better and it's probably half the cost.If you haven't visited Istanbul, your life is not complete! lol"

If you only have a short time there see the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, Topkapi, Basilica Cistern and take in an hamam. We visited the Arista Bazaar and the Spice Bazaar this time and missed the Grand Bazaar (which can be overwhelming). Watched the people fishing on the Galata Bridge and even stopped in the Pera Palace for a morning tea break. The public transportation system is easy and the trams are the best way to get around - for 3 lira per person (just over a dollar), you can get to the Sultanahmet area from the cruise ship dock. You just put coins (or notes) - must be Turkish lira - into the Jeton machines and get a token, insert it into the turnstyle before getting on the platform. The Turkish people are helpful and friendly, although you have to be prepared to fight off the many book, postcard, carpet, souvenir salespeople."

We also wandered thrugh the University area up to the Suleymaniye mosque and then over to the Prince's Mosque. We found the people to be friendly and we weren't pestered, a polite no thank you was accepted."

The seat of the Ottaman empire for many generations, Istanbul benefitted immensely from the dedication of its people to erect some of the most beautiful mosques in the world. Steeped in history, these historic monuments remain well preserved and have the added benefit for visitors that they are functioning mosques. Outside, the worshipers perform their ablution. It is ideal to visit during prayertimes - 5 times a day at various times depending on the time of year. At this time you can witness the prayer being perfomed in congregation - perhaps the greatest insight people of other faiths can gain into the practice of Islam - its sublime simplicity devoid of iconography which stands it in stark contrast to most faith systems. You don't have to take my word from it but I would recommend seeking out some of the smaller mosques - Rustum Pasah and the new mosque are easily accessible from Sultanahamet."

We ate most nights in tiny shops where we pointed to what we wanted and from street vendors...try the deep fried sardines....WOW."

I stayed here for 3 weeks with my teenage son on our 10,000-mile cycle expedition from Ireland to Japan (book: Long Road, Hard Lessons). We were waiting for Iran visas. It was a great place to wait. Istanbul is full of history with a vibrant atmosphere. There are several distinct areas. We loved the Taksim area, with the interesting, narrow back streets. The Asian side (by boat) is very traditional with interesting buildings everywhere. The Princes Islands are also reached by boat and very historic. The most visited historic area is probably Sultan Ahmet Square, with the Blue Mosque and St Sophia mosque. Nobody could fail to be impressed. Go early morning before the coaches arrive. It's popular."

Since hotel prices seem to be going up the closer one gets to the Blue Mosque and Topkapi museum I always make reservations at a place which is a little further away, say in the area of the Sultan Ahmet mosque (Fatih district) which is still close enough to all major attractions of the city. Plus the restaurants and cafes tend to be more reasonably priced.For those of you who are limited on time but still want to see the most famous attractions of the old town I suggest that your first stop should be the Hagia Sophia mosque, followed by the Blue Mosque, the Topkapi museum"

If your travel has been confined to 'western' destinations and/or you are disturbed by different cultures and ambiance, then you might not rank Istanbul so high = obvious Islam; scruffy; chaotic; crowds; language; Rome-style dirty. I found these to be part of the charm and the experience.I was fascination by the inner tension between traditional Islam and the push to modernise in a Western sense. Why do some woman use a scarf head cover, others not, and some wear burkas? In my view dining is overrated in quality but is still excellent value.

If you are on a cruise and don't want to go on a formal tour, the Tram is the way to go. It runs on the main street right in front of the Cruise Terminals and takes you near all the major attractions in Old Town You can buy your tickets at the stop, and they cost only about a dollar each. Most maps will have the tram route on it. Rick Steves' Istanbul info has details that are helpful."

You can also take a tram and go down to visit Egyptian (Spice) Bazaar (M\u0131s\u0131r \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131) which is worth seeing.

My recommendation for the Churches, Mosques, Palaces and Museums in this city is to use the Blue Guide and do not rush anything. The great Byzantine Churches and the Imperial Mosques are among the most beautiful and impressive buildings on earth. Topkapi and its Harem are evocative too. Make this city visit on your own. To do so will bring rewards few attractions anywhere on the planet can match. There are crowds at Hagia Sophia and Topkapi, even in May. Go off season if possible and do go early in the morning or late afternoon. The tour groups can lessen the experience, but they pay almost no attention to the Harem. The lesser Imperial Mosques are magnificent too. It is not useful to specify anything further. Just be sure to visit Constantinople."

As it is written in Wikipedia:The name of the place was driven from the armory known as Tophane-i Amire (English: Imperial armory), which was built in the reign (1451\u20131481) of Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. Its main purpose was the manufacturing cannons and cannon balls. Tophane, which could be seen in Melling's (1763\u20131831) engraving, has not been able to survive to this day. In 1823, during the Firuz Agha fire, the barracks were burned down only to be renewed soon later. Tophane building is currently used as the culture and arts center of Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts and it is housing many exhibitions.Moreover, at the moment there is an interactive exhibition about Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael, called 'The Great Masters' at Tophane-i Amire Culture and Arts Center. The curators of the exhibition are renowned art historians Dr. Francesco Buranelli, chairman of the Vatican Museum and Alessandro Vezzosi, the Director of Leonardo da Vinci Museum. The exhibition will be open until 31 July. For further details, please visit: http://www.thegreatmasters-ist.com/As Arter Tasarim (The designer and organizer of the exhibition project in Istanbul), we would like the place and the exhibition to be included in the art venues in Istanbul on tripadvisor. If required, the photos of the venue and the visuals of the exhibition could be sent.Regards,Sebla SahinArter TasarimMarketing and Communications Director"

Since my hotel is near Grand Bazaar, I usually took Metro back instead of walking after sight-seeing the whole day. I bought souvenirs along the way, and found it was slightly expensive than other shops. I guess a good bargain skill is needed! Moreover, don't refrain from drinking water, kept your self hydrated, there are plenty of clean restroom all around. And there are also many restaurants along they way,thus, the competition is strong. Normally the restaurants guy would linger around, saying \"hello, how are you\", trying to get you into their restaurants. There is a yellow wooden house, which is tourist police station just opposite the basilica cistern. The police is very helpful. I suggest if you have any questions, you ask them instead of asking other locals. Overall, I would say, there are new excavation going on, worth to pay a second visit next time."

I was in Istanbul in April for a 3 night break - the sun shone down on the first day, then the rest of the trip was milky-grey: misty & drizzly!But I still had a great time - there are lots of indoor monumental buildings & museums to see in the historic area as Istanbul is a unique fusion of history & scenery & is thick with atmosphere, there's something for everyone.The capital of not one but four fallen empires, Turkey's biggest city has long been a draw for visitors - the most easterly stop on the Orient Express, previously known as Constantinople & before that Byzantium, it is one of the oldest cities in the world & for nearly 500 years, it was the capital of the Ottoman Empire, a powerful regime that, at its height, stretched from Hungary to Iraq.Your day will start early & evocatively with the amplified strain of the muezzin calling the faithful to prayer. I found one of the best ways to explore the historic area is on foot - proceeding through the city at a leisurely pace, you have time to notice all the little things, but enlisting the services of a good local guide could be a real asset. You could zoom in on a specific aspect of the city with a walking tour or class. The only city spanning two continents, most of the historical sites are on the European side.PLACES TO SEE An enticing starting point for the historic area is shopping in the 550-year-old lively, colourful Grand Bazaar - it's a consumers' paradise.For more workaday souvenirs, try the scents & sights of the city's ancient Spice Market Bazaar, Rustem Pasa Mosque stands proud within easy walking distance of the Spice Bazaar - built during the Ottoman Empire, it showcases the best Ottoman architecture & exquisite Iznik tiles.One of Istanbul's most famous sights is the Blue Mosque - colossal and wondrous.The Yerebatan underground cisterns are worth a visit for the carved stone columns.Another example of Istanbul's magnificence - the sprawling Topkapi Palace was the glory of the Ottoman Empire, the crown jewel of Istanbul's history, & the centre of power from where the Ottoman sultans ruled an empire as big as the United States from 1465 to 1853. Home to many a colourful story, today it is a museum..The 6th-century glorious, mosaic-filled Ayasofya mosque, also known by its Greek name Hagia Sophia was once a Byzantine church only for Christians; then made into a mosque for just Muslims under the Ottomans. It is a not to be missed fascinating impressive museum for all.I would recommend the historic areas to all."

Finally I got a chance to see Istanbul and to be honest I was expecting more. I guess it is because everyone was telling me all the time how beautiful that city is. Blue mosque is beautiful and Hagia Sophia is something that is nice to see and knowing that it is a building more than 1500 years old is impressive. But other that, hm... And for every attraction there is a fee at least 10 euro except for the Blue mosque which is free... Another attraction that was not bad for me was Dolmabache palace and Harem where Sultan lived with his wifes... You can see all major historical attractions in two, and even one day.I was disappointed with the food a lot that at the end I was looking for Burger King, and I hate fast food... Entree is around 15 euros per person in some average restaurant and it is small... It would be ok if the size of the portion is fine but every time it was too small even for me and I am a skinny lady and not to mention the taste... So I would say prices are European but level of hygiene and service quite below... Bazaar, nothing special in every country they are selling same pashmina, same mostly Chinese made staff, same like any Arabic country, you visit one of them you' ve seen them all... And they are trying to rip you off on every corner, starting from taxi drivers. If they see you are a tourist suddenly 20 lira ride becomes 50 at least. Even in restaurant they write sometimes additional price by hand on the receipt... I went even to Princess island as everyone was saying how beautiful it is, but not my taste, dirty and crowdy... So I would ruther spend my money to visit some other destination and Istanbul probably as a one or max two days stop..."

Wandering among the side streets is well worth it, since the main streets (Divan Yolu and Alemdar Cadessi) are very commercial, geared to tourists. The side streets have stores, of course, but they're quieter and show more of what the Istanbul resident sees and lives. Of course you have to see Hagia Sophia (Ayasofya), the Blue Mosque, the Cistern, the Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace Museum, and the Archaeological Museum. There's also the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Art, the Egyptian Obelisk on the site of the old Hippodrome, and the Mosaics Museum (which was closed when I was there, but I was told it's magnificent). Everyone will want to sell you something -- guide service in Ayasofya, or a carpet, or something -- but you can smile and say no politely and keep walking. The rule of thumb on bargaining is DO IT. Start at 50% of what was asked, and be prepared to walk away. This applies in stores (even those that seem upscale) and with street vendors. If they're really want to sell you something, they'll offer a lesser price. Keep at it, since it's part of the experience of being in Istanbul."

Pedlars everywhere - mainly kids; pestering you as walk and when you sit down to eat near Grand Bazaar - tissues, socks, fake perfume, jackets, toys, etc As you try to walk passed bars & restaurants they will invite you in.

Unfortunately, much of the architecture from the 2600 years of history in Istanbul has been destroyed (thanks to Septimus Severus). However, what remains is absolutely beautiful. You can see the Blue Mosque (formally known as Sultanahmet Mosque), Haghia Sophia (built as a church, rebuilt a few times, then converted into a mosque after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and now a museum), Topkapi Palace (built in 1453 by Mehmet the Conqueror as the home of the Sultan and the Basilica Cistern (underground water silo). You can also see the remains of the Hippodrome and Constantine\u2019s Column. You can then cross the inlet of water known as the Golden Horn. Here you can see the Galata Tower (great 360 degree view of the city) and Dolmobahce palace, which replaced Topkapi as the home of the Sultans after the middle of the 19th century. Even with all the destruction that Istanbul has been home to, much of the history still remains. It\u2019s great to see Byzantine era structures, Roman edifices and churches, and Muslim mosques and palaces all in the same city."

Both sides offer much. If looking at the old city side then you will be happy to see everything from ancient structure to a world wonder. That in itself is rare but to have so much in such a small area is just great. There are few cities in the world that can match the amount of history and physical evidence of that city in such great condition. Plus the prices for these are great. Grand Bazaar is free, blue mosque is free and many things that are on display outdoors is obviously free. The other attractions will cost but not much and well worth seeing. I cant see anyone saying that they wouldn't pay 20 euro or so to see the inside of the hagia. I mean common. You have to go in if you are there right!"

To be honest, the blue mosque is not very special on the inside and if the lines stretch around the block\u015f don't waste your time standing in line for hours. Topkap\u0131 and Hagia Sophia are more interesting to see and visit. See the basilica cisterns before they collapse. A recent UNESCO Heritage report criticized Turkey and Istanbul for their lack of care for the cisterns. The biggest concern is all the tour buses parking above them and that they may crack and eventually collapse. So se them while you can and find the medusa heads!"

Get a guide for the Palace and Blue Mosque or do your research before you get there to truly appreciate the history of this remarkable ancient yet functional city.

Some major improvements around the main square(Topkapi, Ayasofya, Blue Mosque) hampered walking a little but suspect they may be finished by summer 2012. Walking from Galata Bridge to Egyptian Bazaar (cheaper and more manageable than Grande Bazaar) takes you by the New Mosque (faces the sea and several hundred years old- and very beautiful inside). After the Egyptian Bazaar you can walk up to the Grand Bazaar and its adjacent Mosque ( and bookstalls) stopping at a big white tent in the square for a very cheap cup of soup etc."

The cobbled streets.. the wooden houses lining the area, the people and the shops: all are from a different era!The place is littered with places of historic importance, like the Hagia Sophia, The Blue Mosque, The Sultan's tomb, the Bascilia Cistern, The Topkapi Palace, The Grand Bazaar and many more. Inorder to ensure you do not miss out on any attractions, suggest you carry a guide and if possible plan your route in advance. Check if the hotel lobbyist can help you with it.It is strongly recommended that you stay within this area so you can stroll around at leisure. Another piece of advise is that you build your trip around the Bosphorous tour and the Princess Island tour (incase you wish to take those) as they are not operating on certain days, and on spare days do the walk-around this area for the tour of the many historical places it has to offer."

One last tip: when visiting the major sites (Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace), be aware that cruise ship days will be much more crowded.

Although the architecture is incredulous, the carpet salesmen are obnoxious and pushy. They really wear on my enjoyment of the area. These salesmen can turn a nice vacation into a place I personally am ready to leave from. Just for fun, I engaged in conversation with one of the aforementioned carpet salesmen and had him show me some carpets. WOW!! my gosh, these men really value their carpets. These prices are some of the highest priced pieces I have ever been quoted. I have purchased Turkish carpets, Persian carpets, etc. here in the states for years and I get far better prices from local salesmen than I was being quoted in Sultanahmet.

The nights and the restaurants with the turkish music are very romanyic. Another advantage is that u can explore all the sites in the day time then relax in thr evening. Don't miss restaurants on the roofs. Enjoy!"

            "review": "Argues Travel good travel operators. We took a private tour with Argues Travel.Shukru who does part time work with Argues was a really good guide, specially good with small children (we had 2). He has a degree in archaelogy and guiding which is useful as he knows something about everything....he is also honest (for example, he mentioned he hadnt been to the top of the Galata Tower till date!!)....Edip who planned our itinerary was really good and despite our making multiple changes he was always willing to allow for changes. Except 1 day where we felt he should have got us a hired car (we used taxis instead), we were generally ok on transportation. In terms of pricing, I compared pricing against one other agent and their pricing was more competitive, but not sure if they are the most value for money. One important thing to note is that if you are living in the Sultanamet area, you don't spend much on travel as you walk to all the sites. Also, entry fees is really low in most places (in some cases its free) so don't think such things cost a lot."

However, if you want to do anything after dinner, old town only offer hooka cafes (not to be confused with bars). You'll be back in your hotel by 11 pm at the latest."

My wife and I recently returned from a long holiday in Turkey, and it was Argeus Tourism & Travel representative Mehmet, who helped us to book our trip and put together an excellent itinerary, which made us have a dream vacation. Mehmet was most helpful and a thorough professional, from the initial enquiry right through to the final booking. We explained to him what it was we wanted out of our trip and he took the time to go the extra mile to help us and he was easy to communicate with, clear and precise. He was also very efficient in sending the train tickets directly to our hotel upon our arrival in Istanbul for our overnight trip to Ankara.All in all, our trip went very smoothly and we would definitely recommend this travel agency to anybody because of the flawless service and arrangements as well as superb personal service from Mehmet of Argeus Tourism and Travel. We would not hesitate to use them again. Everything they arranged was as promised, and we highly recommend Argeus to anybody that might be thinking about travelling within Turkey. Almost every aspect of the trip ran flawlessly and if we did encounter a problem, which one is bound to, when one travels for such a long period, it was handled in very professional manner and promptly, with a positive outcome.We had a great time in a beautiful country, with everything organised very well by Argeus Tourism and Travel - this travel agent comes highly recommended."

There are also various uniformed officials who can help if you ask. I'm talking about an ordinary looking unidentified man who offers to provide something for nothing as in free, on-the-house or \"traditional hospitality\" He may say he can show you the sights and tell you some history. He will then suggest you come and use his WC and refreshment facilities for nothing or visit his shop but under no obligation. There is no such thing as something for nothing. If you find yourself being taken towards a carpet shop, get away while you can. You won't get out until each of you has spent a lot of money. If one of you has no credit card on you, a man will later accompany you to your hotel to get it or some other form of money. I sat outside one such place while my friends were being fleeced inside. I watched as tourists were brought in and taken to different rooms in the building to be \"worked on\". I was brought tea (which I refused) and the man got quite cross and said it was a turkish tradition. Then one of my friends came out and told me it was safe to go inside now! (I didn't) My friends not only bought expensive things they didn't need but then agreed to go back the following day to pick up a driver (everywhere is within walking distance) and accepted the offer of a meal for all of us \"on the house\" ! I managed to talk them out of these activities, but they had left their goods at the shop for \"safe keeping\" so they had to go back to fetch them which provided the opportunity for more persuasion. These men are like stoats with a rabbit. Don't let them catch you."

I booked my hotel at the Sultan Ahmet area in The Aya Sofia Best Western which share the wall with St Sophiya. The area is truly historic and admin of Istanbul maintained its historical value alive by not allowing mindless new construction.My hotel was tremendously accessible to be traveled to the all parts of the Istanbul. In front of the hotel metro (surface and underground train) equivalent to Underground of London and Metro of Milan and the station was on five minutes walk. I can clearly see the giant and mystic Sultan Ahmet Masjid (Blue Mosque) from the window of my hotel. Grand Bazar (Kapali carsi) is about 20 minutes walk whereas Masjid Bayazid was not far away as well. On the right turn from my hotel you could easily walk along the Metro line and entered into the Grand Park which is attached to the famous and most historical Top Kapi Palace and after passing through the park it would not be distantly far to reach to the Golden Horn.As I said my hotel wall was next to the St Sophiya, and if I walk down to the left from my hotel I can see first the underground ancient water supply ponds, which I missed to visit despite my hotel nearness to that place, and further to left, walking along the St Sophiya wall you can turn towards Top Kapi Palace. Top Kapi palace is unbelievably grand and mystic. After entering into the palace if turn your eyes towards you will see deep blue water of Strait of Bosporus which connects Black Sea to Sea of Marmara. I can not forget the beauty of the waters shades and the colorful sails of the boats floating over the waves of the sea.I would strongly suggest who like to visit Istanbul that they should stay in Sulatnahmet which is indeed a heart of Istanbul."

My friends and I visited around Christmasand the lights and festivities were a welcoming surprise. We especially enjoyed Sofia Masque. This is spectacular in the daytime or nighttime when it is lit with blue lights. We sipped tea by the sea and watch as the busy ferry activity took place around us. We visited some outer areas by ferry which was so much fun. The people were welcoming everywhere we went. There is no food like the food in Istanbul fresh, hot and delicious. I would go back just for that. This is a very active nightlife there and so much shopping. We had a great time and plan to return again next year. We did not take a tour we did it on our own."
