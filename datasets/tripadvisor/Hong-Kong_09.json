I'm sure at some point you will cross over from TST to Central and vice Versa so instead of taking the couple of stops on the MTR why not go across by boat, it's a little longer but the breeze and views are excellent and it is a great way to get some great skyline photos. You can also take it in the day or night time to get a different view of the iconic skyline Hong Kong has to offer. If you already have an octupus card then like most things in Hong Kong you can use this to get across and it won't cost you much either. Boats go to central and wan chai so make sure you get the correct one."

I didn't actually join the first ferry to arrive after I'd gone through the barrier, I waited for the crowd to get on then waited at the front of the queue for the next one, only a few minutes later, so I could then sit close to the edge. It only took about five minutes but you get great views of the harbour, especially all the lights in the evening. Well worth it."

The ferries were old but they maintained it clean and safe. I don't suggest this mode of transportation though if you are in a hurry as MTR is obviously quicker. It is highly recommended for people who want a different taste of Hong Kong where one could appreciate the sea and the buildings that grow taller as the ferry moves closer to land. We took the ferry in the afternoon and there were only a few passengers. I wasn't sure though how crowded it could get. So the cruise was chill and relaxing. Taking the ferry in the evening is also highly suggested as the view gives a colorful skyline from the lit buildings."

You couple that with a tuneless MIDI instrumental soundtrack that sounds like it was composed by a sadistic robot in 1993. Over. And over. And . . . well, you get the idea."

It is dingy, dark and dirty, a far cry from what one usually associates with stars.It has been like that for many years. The pier on Hong Kong side is fairly new due to the relocation. We do not need chrome and glass to upgrade the Kowloon pier but if they wish to retain the third-world charm they can still make it more pleasant by giving it a new coat of paint, improving the lighting, or as a minimum, getting rid of the grime and cleaning up the place.The Star Ferry is almost a 'must-go' for all tourists and I wonder how the parent company, The Wharf (Holdings) Limited who is not without money, can bear to see the pier in such a poor condition. After all, how much does it cost to paint and install better lighting in a small pier like that?"

There are wonderful views of Hong Kong Island from the Star Ferry terminal. The price is not that expensive. Be wary of the shifting gangplanks and sometimes the ride is not very smooth due to the choppy sea. The ferry is not really that modern, it is pretty old. But, it adds to the charm. On the short ride you can enjoys views on both sides of the harbor. Many times, fog obscures the view. A late afternoon ride may be better compared to early morning."

I'd been on the Star Ferry as a tourist but I wasn't familiar with travelling back and forth between Central (IFC) and TST. The Star Ferry is the cheapest and easiest way to travel between these two destinations. The view in the daytime well and truly beats the austere MTR but in the evening, the view is a magical kaleidoscope of colourful buildings and skylines, a must for everyone. The Star Ferry is a much more pleasant option to the crowded MTR. Getting there is relatively simple, if you're in IFC, just head towards the Apple Store and then exit and follow the signs (or ferris wheel) ... the ferry terminal is a 5 minute walk once you exit the IFC Mall. You can select either the lower or upper deck. Ferries come approximately every 5 minutes so you never have to wait long. The Star Ferry is a relaxing and delightful way to commute between Central and TST."

This is by far the best way to cross the harbour, the cost is extremely cheap (HKD$2), it is not that busy, and if you time it right, it is pretty quick. The best part of the journey are the views, you get million dollar views for a couple dollars. I took this from Kowloon to Central and back, the only drawback is that the ferry stops running between 10-11PM, so if you miss it, then you'll need to take the MTR.

Make sure you either go upstairs to ride on the upper deck or just go straight ahead as you enter the pier, if you want to be on the lower deck, as you cannot change decks once on board, or at least we didn't see a way.

All of the above, and my only regret is only using the Star Ferry once in my three day visit. It reminds me of the Washington State Ferries, on a much smaller scale and equally amazing experience. Have an Octopus card? You have everything you need to enjoy the Star Ferry.Unfortunately the upper deck was closed off during my transit from Kowloon to Central, but the views were just as amazing. On a Monday afternoon, there was maybe 1/3 occupancy aboard giving visitors ample room to move about and take in the skyline. I would highly recommend, while the MTR is a fast people mover....it's nice to step back in time and soak in Hong Kong from the water."

Star Ferry is one of those things that you just need to do when in HK- you can buy tickets before boarding, but put some cash on an Octopus card (available from railway stations) and you don't even need to take the card out of your wallet (just hold your wallet/purse over the octopus sign beside the entry barrier). Saves time and that annoyance when you just missed the ferry because you waited in a queue for the ticket machine! If you miss one don't panic- another will be there in a few mins."

There is an elevated that will directly connect you to Hong Kong station (for connections to the Airport), which also has underground walking connectors to Central MTR station, for transfer to other MTR lines. Unfortunately, the Kowloon side is not as well-integrated, a bit far from Kowloon station or other stops when its hot out. Also, due to the old nature of the ships, the top deck feels fairly closed-in. I was hoping to get some open photo ops of the skyline and got a few, but would be nice to have a more open deck.

The construction going on in Wan Chai may make transport back from the ferry a bit inconvenient. MTR, buses and taxis are still available with a short walk but if that's too much, go towards Central instead."

It was a short ferry ride-- the distance between the two coasts has become drastically closer with the past half decade due to land reclamation in development. It is beautiful in the sunset and the well-lit lights of the high-rise, some topped by neon signs. The breeze was welcoming after a hot day.We took many photos of the skyline and the harbour during the ride---a nostalgic capture of the \"Beautiful Pearl of the Orient\" ( a name well-known globally as we grew up in this place). $2+ for the ride--- surely worth the money and the time spent. Just watch your steps while you disembark. "

If you finished shopping at Ocean Terminal/TST, hop on the star ferry to go across the water n enjoy an afternoon tea/drink in Central (mandarin oriental or IFC)..the ferry is cheap and relaxing...is my favourite thing to do in HK. Just make sure is not during rush hour or a very windy/rainy day. And if u see the ferry is leaving...no need to run for it..relax as the next one comes within 5 min...just enjoy the view"

If you are riding this at summer, an air conditioning cab is available (free entry with ticket and only for some ferries)!You can choose the upper and lower deck of it while the upper deck is more enjoyable with the views and the lower deck for sea winds.

Apparently this ferry has been in service for over 100 years, so it is a piece of Hong Kong history that you are experiencing when getting on board. The ferry had the classic design with engines at both end, so it doesn't turn. It just goes in one direction with one engine, and goes back with the other. The seats are also designed to be able to face both directions by simply moving the back to the other side. If you travel at night, you can enjoy the night view which includes HK big wheel - something the underground MTR won't have."

Apart from the historical aspect, the Star Ferry will also give you a prime vantage point for snapping amazing pictures. It can become a bit funny when the maritime traffic gets busy. Between barges, ferries, dinghies and other tugboats, there is a lot of floating devices in there.Last, the Star Ferry remains a cheap and efficient mode of transport to go back and forth between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central.

You buy a token, go through the turnstile, wait in the holding area, when the gate opens and the light goes on, time to go down the ramp and board the boat for the 10 or so minute crossing. Fun to see the harbor from the water. We even bought a token as a souvenir."

It doesn't really give a feeling of a historic berth. Hong Kong is always re-configuring the shoreline by adding and adding more land. 25 years ago the harbour was wider. The Central Post Office and Exchange Square was the border of the harbour. It was even wider back in the good ole days. The Mandarin Oriental sat at the water's edge. None-the-less to view both skylines, nothing like ground zero view from the harbour. It's spectacular. The ferry has still retained it's wooden decks and dual position bench backs. The bench back swings forward and backwards to orient the direction of the seating to the direction of the ferry. The ferry sides are open so you can get the battering of salt laden winds. The ferry's fore and aft are protected from the elements. The deck hands appear gruff, but are very polite. The Central and Tsim Sha Tsui terminals have various types of concessions. There are historic Star Ferry photos at the Tsim Sha Tsui terminal. There are ferry terminals in Wanchai and Hong Hom too. However the most popular is Central - Tsim Sha Tsui terminals. The cost is nominal. It's a good way to experience Hong Kong."

Try upper deck one way and lower deck on return. Star Ferry trip has to be on your HK to do list. Would not recommend if raining, as a plastic sheet is used to keep the rain out of the ferry (and you can't really see thru it)."

Well, this is better, mostly because of the view! As an added bonus, traveling across Hong Kong harbor is VERY inexpensive when you travel by ferry. Loved all the rides we took this way. The best views of all were at night, with the city, on both sides of the harbor, all lit up. As a hint, use an Octopus card and pay to ride on the upper deck, the view is better and the trip through the turnstiles is even quicker when all you have to do is hold the card to the reader. In short, this is THEY way to cross the harbor. Try it!"

There is nothing new to say about the Star Ferry except that it is living in its own past now that it no longer serves as primary transport for almost anyone--including me, as it once did, years ago. The ferry company struggles unnecessarily with the Hong Kong Government to raise fares by the equivalent of a few US cents, or UK p, and collectively, we here have never seen so much angst over what should be a simple problem to solve.They have already cut routes to the bone and have nothing left to do about that. It is impossible for them to make money without a huge subsidy or some change to the business model. So, since this is primarily a tourist thing now and since it links two significant tourist areas (Tsim Sha Tsui and Central District), here is my suggestion:stop trying to be a mass-transit system, apply to raise the fares to something like HK$50 per trip, reduce the frequency and let the ferries go in a circular direction around what's left of the inner harbour. Tourists could still say they \"took the Star Ferry,\" it would be affordable, it need not be a full-fledged harbour tour, and some of the staff reduction could be managed through attrition.Considering that HK$50 barely buys a beer in most night clubs, what's to lose? But I suppose they have done the homework on this, and decided it wouldn't work, but it's clearly not working financially now either.End of lecture!"

If you are visiting Hong Kong, you must go on it at least once. It runs every few minutes from Central to Tsim Sha Tsui and a bit less frequently from Wan Chai to TST. The boats are old but comfortable and it has to be one of the best views of the famous HK skyline - both Island side and Kowloon side - available at any price. And the price for the Star Ferry is dirt cheap - about the equivalent of 30p sterling for what is one of the top attraction in the Territory. And that's the price for first class! It's not just a tourist ride - locals use it all the time to travel between the island and Kowloon. The ferry terminal in Central moved a few years ago and is now a bit less convenient to get to. But it's well worth the effort and still not far to walk from the IFC Mall or Central MTR. Don't miss it!"

Like the Trams the Star Ferry is steeped in history, even down to riots in the 1960's when they attempted to raise the fair.Up until the early 2000's the Hong Kong side terminus was right in the heart of the Central business district and it was a two minute walk from the Tram to the Ferry. Unfortunately in the mid 2000's , as part of the reclamations that are slowly filling in Victoria Harbour, a new terminal was built around a kilometre from Central, so the Ferry lost its convenience factor . However its still a must travel experience even if only a one way trip. There are still two classes, upper deck, favoured by tourists and lower deck where you mingle with local traders and their goods. This is open to the weather. The upper deck has air conditioned compartments front and rear with the middle section open to the weather except when it rains and plastic curtains are rolled downThe upper deck seats have hinged backs so can be arranged depending on the direction of travel."

There are various ways to get around Hong Kong, however if you're not in a hurry; concerned about being claustrophobic, or perhaps want a view; then absolutely nothing beat this. Although the ferries themselves are very old but still sea worthy; but if you suffer from sea sickness then I'd highly avoid this as there is a great deal of rocking motion. In trains for MTR/KCR, you're shoved and squished into a can with lots of other people but at least its air conditioned unlike a star ferry which is not.If you have small children with you, I'd recommend taking a good pram with brakes and situated close by so you can keep an eye on it. Or a baby carrier. As i said it does get rocky a fair bit."

It can be splitted into 3 parts at the upper deck. The seats are the same at 3 parts. At the middle part, there is no window. In case of rain, the sailor will come and pull down the plastic curtains at the top, You can find windows at both ends. In summer time, one of the ends is air-conditioned. Please don't open the window.The lower deck cost you lower (only a few cents less). It is very near to the engine room. So, you can imagine that it is a bit noisy and hot. No worry about it. Many travellers sit there. It is a very good experience for you to get close to the sea and see the ferry surfing fast.One thing I have to tell you. Please pay attention on the platform between the ferry and the pier. Victoria Harbour is not a quite sea. Sometimes the sea is a bit rough and the platform will go up or down according to the sea waves. Most of the time, you can easily come across. But at the time of rough sea, the sailor will stop you until the waves got calm for a moment.Another thing I have to tell you is the chair back. All of them can be changed direction by simply pull to the other side.It is a very good experience that just pay $2 something and can enjoy a 5 minutes journey. Also you can enjoy the ups and downs in a windy day."

Star Ferry is probably the most famous way to cross the Victoria Harbour and operates two commuter routes from Tsim Tsa Tsui in Kowloon to Central and Wan Chai in Hong Kong respectively.

The ferries offer great views of the Hong Kong Skyline and Victoria Harbour especially from the upper deck.The ferries operate from early morning to late night and are cheap, fast and convenient with an adult ticket on the upper deck costing less than 35 cents (US) on weekdays rising to 50 cents (US) on weekends and holidays. Lower deck tickets are even cheaper. In addition to the regular services, Star Ferry also operates day and night Harbour Cruises each lasting about an hour and a Symphony of Lights cruise covering the famous sound and light show of Hong Kong. Being tourist oriented, these services are unfortunately much more expensive.Not to be missed if you are in Hong Kong."

I though it strange how highly rated the Star Ferry was before I used it, as it was rated high as an attraction in its own right over just transportation, but there is something about it which makes it such an awesome experience! It is just very satisfying to use due to how efficient they run, how convenient they are, and how ridiculously cheap!! Only drawback is that it is a bit of walk from the docks to the busy part of the island, but is an enjoyable walk as it is all through raised walkways."

We paid for our ticket via a vending machine but you can also use an octopus card to pay. For upper deck, on Monday to Friday, adult fare costs around HKD 2.50 and child fare HKD 1.50 while on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, adult fare costs around HKD 3.40 and child fare HKD 2.10. For lower deck, on Monday to Friday, adult fare costs around HKD 2.00 and child fare HKD 1.40 while on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, adult fare costs around HKD 2.80 and child fare HKD 2.00. For Hong Kong residents who are over 65 years old, lower deck is free Monday to Sunday. The view is amazing and thankfully the water was calm that day. We rode the ferry during the day but I have yet to experience it at night. I bet the view is more spectacular though. Highly recommended for visitors."

We don't have rivers in such a small city of Hong Kong but we do have a internationally renowned harbour. Star Ferry is probably the oldest official public transport to connect people across the harbour. But it is not a very popular public transport nowadays. There are only from routes left, two start from Tsim Sha Tsui and one from Hung Hom. All three routes travels to either Wanchai or Central. Star Ferry may not be an efficient transport comparing to MTR (subway or metro) but is is the best way to appreciate the harbour view of Hong Kong. It costs around HK$2-3 per trip. I would recommend the Tsim Sha Tsui to Central route and the best time to take it is a little bit before 8 pm as you can enjoy the Hong Kong Symphony Lighting Show.

Can sit either side. Do not confuse with the harbour tour. There are food shops at both pier. Central pier is near HK or central pier, via the bridge. HK is nearer, in my opinion. About 10 mins walk to the central pier from HK mtr."

Add to that there's a vintage element to the boats that adds some whimsy to the ride. Even though it was a long weekend in China, the ferry wasn't full.

The terminals are a bit of a walk from the MTR stations and it's not the most efficient way to travel (the MTR takes you directly to and from Hong kong island anyway). However, riding it at least once gives you a short experience of ferry travel and a cheap sight-seeing view of the HK coastlines. For the price of the ride, it's well worth it. But if you're not into the history and experience, it's not something you'll miss."

I also wanted to be able to experience what lay across the water. These ferries were the best way of doing this - cheap and full of character!. The fare across is only about \u00a30.25 each way and a token to get through the entry turnstile is bought from a nearby machine. The journey across the water only takes about 10 mins, but you do get great views of the harbour traffic and of both Hong Kong Island - and of the other side. I did get off at the other side - you almost immediately walk into a large shopping centre (But only after being approached by loads of guys trying to whisk you off to secret shops to sell you fake watches.. or suits).Did I enjoy the trip over - YesWould I recommend it to friends ? - Come on.. how else would you want to cross the water?Would I do it again - Yes"

They also offer cruises around the harbor to see the city. I suggest going at night to see the \"symphony of lights\" which is the world's largest light show.

Now, it has become a must-go tourist itinerary. From TST to Central, the trip takes only a few minutes, but you will see all the iconic buildings by the both sides of Victoria Harbour, not to mention the ferry fare is only a few HK dollars. You don't have to join expensive harbour tours. Isn't it a good news for budget travellers? If you want to go to one of the outlying islands, most of the piers to those islands are just an arm length to Star Ferry in Central. Pop in one to see the beautiful authentic countryside of Hong Kong."

To this day, it never ceases to impress me what a great way it is to view the harbour. It is worth doing several times a day, not least for the fact of its cheapness. By day you get excellent vista of the city scape, and by night there is the sparkling forest of lights from the illuminated buildings. The leisurely nature of the trip also adds value to the experience. Watching how the crews and the staff on the shore skillfully dock the ferries is another plus."

The Star Ferry crossing provides a means to grasp the inclusive Hong Kong core, from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island central (the government and long-time commercial hub). Travel during the day is a mix of a variety of boats in transit -- and above all provides a moment of tranquility away from Hong Kong's busy streets and density. Night travel has become something special, as as dusk there are light shows that include lighting up buildings and a variety of spotlights -- that reach a peak in a roughly 15 minute musical display that is spectacular. Seeing the show from the deck of the Star Ferry is well-worth the minimal transit fee -- as an alternative to the more expensive boats that provide harbor access to the light show. The Star Ferries have two decks that offer their own variety. There is ample seating as also opportunity to walk the more-or-less open decks. The ride takes roughly 15 minutes one way. You must leave the ferry at either end, and reembark with another ticket. There are two destination points in the Central district; a single on the Kowloon side. ."

The train is entirely underground, always incredibly crowded, and costs upwards of $90 one way. The ferry, on the other hand, costs more like $20-30 depending on the day.They run about every ten minutes until 23:30, and the journey across takes a similar time. During this journey, you are treated to great views of the approaching part of the city, the harbour, and some of the islands in the bay. If you sit in the middle section there is a nice breeze on a hot day compared to the sticky end compartments. You can even buy your ticket via Octopus, for those using public transport regularly in the city.Given the clear advantages of the ferry, including the price as well as the experience, why anyone would go via MTR is beyond me."

Inexpensive, relaxing, fun, historical and convenient. We also took an hour long Star Ferry ride around the harbor (it was included in the hop-on / hop-off Big Red Bus tours) and enjoy the beautiful sights on Hong Kong & Kowloon. We also gained historical perspective of this gem of a boat. I suggest the hour long ride - it is relaxing, spacious, In-door air conditioned and outdoor seating, provides amazing views of the active and bustling harbor, is narrated with facts and landmarks during the tour and they serve snacks, beverages (including beer and wine) and souvenirs. To us, after a day of chasing down the various sights, sounds and must see things in and around the city - this was a great way to unwind and unplug. We grabbed a beer and a snack and drank in the sights of the city around us with a non-over burdening narrative about the historical sites of the city and the landscape that makes up this beautiful city. After bouncing from sight to sight all day - this was a relaxing way to soak in the city from a different view point & perspective. Beautiful tour during the day, around sunset and or in the evening. All provided a beautiful view of the surrounding sky lines with an informative historical perspective. Great for family, couples, friends and or solo. Great way to catch your breath and see this beautiful city. Enjoy & CHEERS!"

Further, as the time was around 8 in the evening, I got to see the sound and light show \"Symphony of Lights\" from the ferry.Instead of taking the MTR to Tung Chung, I took the Ferry from Central to Mui Wo.

It makes it so much easier to travel to the dark side of Hong Kong compare to taking bus or the metro.The view you can see on the ferry by day and by night are completely different and they are both wonderful in their own ways; romantic, nostalgic and almost surreal. I have lived in HK my whole life, and I love it dearly. It never gets boring and it makes me feel so much feels every time."

The rest of the time it's really handy to get from one side to another. After a nice walk down the Avenue of Stars it's a nice way to see the city from the water. Some ideas: Go on the service to Central because you can get on to the upper deck for 50c more, less crowded, better views. When you get to the Tsim Sha Tsui terminal just follow the signs, there's a ticket office on the way. At the other side you can just turn round and go back, or explore the shopping, or walk along to Wan Chai terminal - it's over a kilometre but lots to see.Access to the metro and bus routes is easy, there's also a taxi rank if you are so inclined.It's really a must do for a visitor, evenv a fairly regular visitor like me."

With a stunning Habour scenery, every trip to Hong KongI always find an excuse to cross the habour with the Star Ferry. To view the Hong Kong skylines from the TSTpromenade is another story which we usually do. For me,it is always a one way trip from TST to Central as I rather use an MRT back to Kowloon after a long day in Hong KongIsland. I would suggest anyway that you find some timetaking one more ride in the evening too as it is a fantastic view while crossing the habour at nighttime even though you watch the Symphony of lights on the TST promenade. But to cross the Habour via the Star Ferry at night, this is something different . Daytime and nighttime crossings make perfect."

I think the most interesting way is ferry for all ages. The fares are cheaper compare to subway. The Star Ferry connects the two important business districts: TST(Tsim Sha Tsui) and Central. There are two stories, the upper level is a bit more money than the lower level. In the upper level, the two ends are enclosed with air conditioning, which is a great relieve from the steamy hot weather! The lower level has no air conditioning, but you will be closer to the water and have good feel of the ocean breeze. It may be cold in winter time, and more noisier. On the boat, you have another view to see either sides of the island and Kowloon. "

Many of the ferries still in service were built nearly 60 years ago. The lacquered wooden seats, brown with age and use, provide a bargain-priced perch from which to take in the sights on both sides of the harbour. The gentle pulsing of the old marine diesel engine offers a rather oddly unhurried soundtrack, in stark contrast to the frenetic pace of Hong Kong, on land and water. The cost of the trip is still less than one tenth of a cup of Starbucks coffee, but the views from the middle of the harbour will linger in your memory much longer than the coffee. For comparison, do a return trip, one leg on the upper deck and one leg on the lower deck. This is an experience in Hong Kong not to be missed!"

You get to see HK Island's Skyscrapers and TST's buildings. BTW, I used my Octopus card for the fare in Star Ferry. I think in about less than 15 minutes, we were already at TST from Central Pier. This is a must-try, really!"

Quick and efficient way to get from the Island to Kowloon side using one of the most iconic transport methods in the world. To experience the real chaos which this ultra dense population creates, take the ferry to the island during morning rush hour. Huge mix of passengers from every walk of life, heading to the city offices. The same route in the evening provides the perfect view of the Islands breathtaking waterfront."

It offers a more scenic route across (compared to the train) and a cheaper way to get across (around 2-4 HKD compared to 6 - 10 HKD via the MTR). Not tough to integrate this into your travel itinerary and use it as a form of transportation in your day to day activities in Hong Kong, I urge you to consider doing so."

The other way is to use the MTR which puts you underground with nothing to see.

A cheap ride to feel the sea breeze, wind that relaxes your soul. It is a journey that stills you mind as you set aside your meeting, activities of the day. Well recommended. On the way back, you can also opt to taking the MTR. A fast but crowded trip that always remind you of New York."

After the ferry tour, I'd give you 2 visit options: 1)check out the night of HK at another angle at the Peak. 2) Or you can go to enjoy the night life of HK in Lan Kwai Fong. Both are great experiences to take in HK."

The Terminal as many shops if you can think it you can find it there. You are also near one of Main Land Chinese shopping centers. Once you get on the Ferry it is a short trip on some of Hong Kongs oldest Ferries. The ferries never turn around they can run both frontwards and backwards. The seat back flip so you are always facing in the forward direction. When you arrive on the Hong Kong island side you are in the heart of some of the most exciting shopping Hong Kong has to offer.It is enjoyable for families and anyone who likes riding on Ferries. The price is excellent also."

Even though Hong Kong Central has a car tunnel and the MTR serves Central from Kowloon, somehow the Star Ferry continues to operate. Service to Hung Hom was dropped a few years ago, but you can still travel to Central and Wan Chai from the Kowloon terminal.It is not at all luxurious; the upper deck fetches a fare of $2.50HK, which is about 35 cents US, and the lower deck, with the engine, is $2.00HK. There is generally an air conditioned portion of the upper deck, but lower deck is open to the elements. All of the seating is wooden benches. There is no dining salon or luxury bar... Nonetheless, I could spend the day riding the Star Ferry, if only as a photographic platform, trying to capture the vitality of Victoria Harbour. Nowadays you need to have an Octopus Card to ride the Star Ferry, but the Octopus Card is now a must have for easily riding the buses and historic trams in Central. You can get or recharge an Octopus Card at 7-11 stores, and there is one near the Kowloon Ferry Terminal."

Still, it has an old school feel to it. It's something I look forward to every time I go to Hong Kong.

Star ferry has been running back and forth across the harbour of Hong Kong for many years transporting millions of tourists and residents during that time. Now it has been shortened in its journey, and its quicker on the MTR, but you cant beat the romance and history of the trip on the Star Ferry. Its a very cheap way to travel and the sights from the ferry as it chugs its way across are priceless. Two classes, with downstairs being ordinary and upper deck first class. Better views fro upper deck, and not as noisy from the engines. Is you're in Hong Kong, you have to go on the Star ferry at least once, and who knows, you may be hooked and use it all the time if you've got time to do so. Highly recommended and is my preferred way of travel, as I can revel in the views rather that the sterile underground environment of the MTR."

Similarly, if you are travelling from TST to Central, sit on the left. Sit on the Eastside. From TST you can also go to Wan Chai and this is a great trip at sunset and breaks the Eastside rule.

The MTR has taken away a lot of the patronage but it is still a must for tourists to cross the harbour. It is cheap and you get your harbour views as you cross. The ferries are old and not air conditioned. On a rainy , windy day the weather sheets may be down to block your view. Pay the extra few cents and travel on the top level! Handy also if you are staying in Kowloon near the harbour. On arrival on Hong Kong Island side it is only a short walk to other ferry terminals if you are planning to visit other islands ( eg Lamma)"

You can feel the breeze of the harbor and see the highrises on both sides.The hour long tour cost 200 HKD, which is alot, but you get a can of soda and a pack of cookies. You also can listen to recorded narration about Hong Kong and the Light Spectacular. It was a good way to spend a rainy evening on my own. The evening tour leaves TST at 6.55 pm and 7.55 pm. They make you line up, but I sat and waited for the line to clear, since it was not busy. There were enough seats on the boat when I went. Service staff are bilingual, so that was also a plus.

In this instance we used ours for the Star Ferries, which proved a brilliant way to get across the bay from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island. Quick and efficient and a good way to cool down at the same time as you gather in the scenery. As they bob across at regular intervals you wont have long to wait. Also it proved a pittance of a fare which in this day and age was most welcomed. Fun way to travel."

In those days it was the only way to cross the harbour apart from a car ferry which ran seperately. This evokes memories of traditional Hong Kong,I can't say more . Wonderful !!"

Though it is fractionally more expensive now, it is the least expensive and best experience in Hong Kong. Take the lower level and cheaper regular class and be with the locals and the food they are carrying and people of all ages from all walks of life. Plus you can stand at the gates right at the water's level on the short ride across the harbor. Enjoy the simple things in Hong Kong along with the more upscale things available in the ever more expensive city."

Not to mention the fun of doing this ride from Kowloon to Central across the H.K. harbour with great views and real smells (acceptable), it is a bargain when compared to MTR. Your Octopus card can be used as well as HKD cashDon't waste your money paying for first class. The view is the same and the ride is fairly short (about 10 mins.) so no need for it.

The efficient deck-hands resplendent in their Daffy Duck style blue uniforms add to the colour. If you have a bit more time their is a one hour harbour cruise available that leaves the Tsim Sha Tsui terminal at five minutes to the hour.

Hong Kong offers countless diverse tourist attractions from getting immersed culturally by visiting its numerous colonial and religious sites like temples and nunneries to modern places of interest like the Hong Kong Disneyland, the many skyscrapers and the abundant modern and chic malls as well as the various unique transportation modes like the Peak Tram, the Ngong Ping Cable Car, the Hong Kong Tramway and the Star Ferry. In my every visit to Hong Kong, I see to it that I take a cruise across the famous and scenic Victoria Harbour via the Star Ferry. Anytime of the day is a nice time to ride the Star Ferry but a night time cruise is the best as you are filled with wonder by the lighted ultramodern architectural marvels of Hong Kong. At the start of the Star Ferry in the Tsim Sha Tsui is the Former Kowloon-Canton Railway Clock Tower or the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower or simply the \"Clock Tower\" which another remnant of Hong Kong's history when it was still a British settlement in Asia. Although, the Star Ferry has a couple of routes, for me the is still the one from the Star Ferry Pier at Tsim Sha Tsui which is adjacent to the Clock Tower across to the Star Ferry at Central, the location of the principal business and economic district of Hong Hong that houses the international headquarters of companies and financial institutions. Before I end my review, it is the most inexpensive and most picturesque way to cross the Victoria Harbour that splits the two main areas of Hong Kong which are the Kowloon Peninsula and the Hong Kong Island. A one way fare is less than HKD $3. Enjoy your stay in Hong Kong as much as I am delighted with my stay there and be sure not to forget to do a Star Ferry cruise."

We relied on little motor boats to take us across if we \"missed the boat\" literally. We called those motor junks Wah La Wah La. Having said that, the Star Ferry is not much different from its early days, at least not outwardly. It is comfortable, cheap and convenient.

It's a short ferry ride but one that is filled with so much color, sounds, splendor. I love riding the Star Ferry. Every time I am in Hong Kong, it is a must-do for me. The Star Ferry has been featured in many movies - probably none as prominently featured as in The World of Suzie Wong (William Holden, Nancy Kwan).

Every time if I am going to Central or Wanchai from Ocean Terminal or Star House or the Culture Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, I will take the Star Ferry. But, recently, Star Ferry has been killing by the greedy Hong Kong Government because the city is keeping on reclamation. This pushes the ferry further away the centre from Central and Wan Chai and makes it not convenient. Although there is a pedestrian bridge leading the passenger from the Central to the pier, however, there is 10 minutes walk required. Whereas Star ferry is still a romantic place to visit especially during the sunset where you can watch the sunset in the middle of the sea. This is still the cheapest cruise we can enjoy the both sides of view of the harbour in Hong Kong. So, I still think that this is a must go places in Hong Kong if you have been there before."

The view of the HK harbor as well as soothing sea breeze make this a really enjoyable diversion. Shopping on the other side of the terminal is full of shopping opportunities; as is the whole of HK. Some claim specialty restaurants are better than others etc but to me everything taste fantastic and every shop has their own attraction. Tsim Sha Tsui is particularly popular because many like myself likes to linger in those little shops and walk around in Nathan road to see the shops and eat Steam Boat or visit the Mosque. There are many Arabic people on Nathan road. The cheapest ie best exchange rate for money is in Chung King Mansion. Cheap hostels are available for ultra cheap accommodation but you have to be careful because some of them have unwelcomed guests like roaches coming into your room and luggage. Most if not all are quite safe. Money changers downstairs are usually pretty honest but still be on the lookout for pick pockets and some unsavory characters around. Police patrol this area regularly. Holiday Inn and other hotels with stars surround the area so if you are tired of roaches then just move next door and pay about 3x more in price. I love this part of HK because everything seems to be cheaper especially breakfast dim sum---- fantastic. My favorite hobby is EATING so my past time is to go into all the tiny little restaurants to taste their dumplings and noodles and and and Please dont forget to try their tropical fruit ---- durian. A bit like blue cheese but taste FABULOUSLY fantastic. Star fruits, jack fruit, dragon fruit etc etc etc. Fruits and veg you never dreamed existed can be found here. In life, try everything the earth has to offer. Dont stick only onto MacDonalds or cheese burger. Going to Asia, esp HK is for the purpose of widening your horizons and experience everything. This place offers simply ANYTHING that you desire and also EVERYTHING you dont even know about."

It is really cheap and it is also cheerful.Visiting Hong Kong and not travelling, at least one way, on the Star Ferry is like going to New York and not taking the Manhattan-Staten Island ferry. It is best to travel on the upper deck - note that the upper and lower decks each have their own access and exits routes at the terminals. Once you are on-board, I don't think it is possible to change. Especially in good weather, the crossing offers excellent photo-opportunities."

For those who do not mind the change, there are a couple of token ticket vending machines in the pier itself.Do not miss the fruit yoghurt stall on the Tsim Sha Tsui side (last stall on the right side during arrival, as you exit from the pier).

Part of the boat is enclosed with air conditioning, which is very good during the hot summer. Most of the time it does not matter. The ferry takes about 10 minutes to make the crossing. The boats are old but in good condition. The complete service is covered so you are out of the rain. It is not very wheelchair compatible. Even with a walker it is challenging."

Two level boat - rather neat as the seats are reversible meaning the back rest can be alternated for the direction.Leaves every 6 to 8 minutes and takes approximately 10 minutes to cross.If you don't have an Octopus (transit) card you can purchase tokens at the station. Adult is approx 2.60 concession (senior) is a little cheaper. Price for upper deck is slightly more ie .50 but it is more comfortable, you can get a lot of spray from the water on the lower deck.You decide which deck you want to ride on before you buy your token but if you mess up as we did on the return trip you can just pay the difference to the attendant.The token machines take coins or $10 or $20 notes and THEY DO give change back."

The iconic little ferries are a must, not just for tourists but also the many residents and workers who use them to travel the short journey between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. Two routes, both starting at Tsim Sha Tsui cross to Central and Wan Chai. The upper deck is more protected from the weather and sea spray whilst the lower deck (slightly cheaper fare) gives uninterrupted views for those using cameras. This really is a great way to cross, not just for the convenience but the views of Kowloon, HK Island and the boats and shipping that use the waterway night and day."

The TST pier is right in front of the Ocean Terminal shopping Mall and within minutes of the museums. Only thing to beware of are the many touts (watches, tailors and bus tours).

If you have the time (and money) to spare while in Hong Kong, and if you find the regular Star Ferry rides too short, I recommend the Star Ferry Harbour Tour, which makes a 1 hour detour around Victoria Harbour. The ticket counters at the respective piers only open around 30 mins before each departure. You can choose to board from Tsim Sha Tsui, Central or Wan Chai. To maximise your time on board, alight where you boarded the ferry. Each ticket entitles you to a small packet of biscuits and a drink, you can pay extra for alcohol. You may choose to have a full picnic but really the main point of this is the views you get as the ferry traverses Victoria Harbour. Passengers are confined to the upper deck, where there is a central air-conditioned area with the snack kiosk and plenty of seating. The stern and bow are open air, and the ferry does not reverse direction during its journey. There is a running commentary of various landmarks, but it is often not in sync (or the landmarks are obscured by newer buildings). Focus on taking photos instead."

Though I suppose if you like that kind of murky ambiance, that could be a plus :). The air is a little fresher on the water than it is onshore and the water looks clean.Tips: 1.Use your Octopus card. The alternative is to line up at the machine to buy a token. You then slip the token into the turnstile to board. 2 Don't rush. If you miss a boat, there's one coming in minutes.3. I didn't see anything for wheelchair accessibility.4. In one case, there were some mild waves and the boarding ramp jiggled up and down a bit, when we were disembarking. Not a problem for me, but might be for those with mobility issues.5. The benches can be rearranged easily to face the other direction (You'll see what I mean when you get there) so you won't have to face backwards on the trip."

The Star ferries criss-cross the bustling Hong Kong harbour from their two piers where Salisbury Road meets Canton Road in Kowloon, adjacent to the iconic Clock Tower and near the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, the HK Space Museum and the HK Museum of Art. The ferries run continuously throughout the day, and for much of the night, about every eight minutes either to Wan Chai (and the Expo Promenade) or to Central for the Peak, Stanley Market and other tourist attractions like Lantau Island. Believe it or not, there are two fare structures depending on whether you opt for the upstairs or the downstairs parts of the ferry. The boarding and disembarking procedures are down to a fine art and with a minimum of fuss. A benefit is also offerred to students and seniors in the form of even lower fares. For three Seniors we paid a grand total of HK$7.50 for a one-way fare to Victoria Island, upstairs. The seats are in serried rows with back rests that can be swivelled in the direction of your travel. The actual crossing of the Harbour takes less than 10 minutes. It's an unbeatable way to appreciate both the beauty and the history of this fascinating relic of Britain's far-flung Empire."

It may \"just\" be a 10 minute trip across Victoria Harbour from Hong Kong to Kowloon (or vide versa) but this must be one of the world's classic \"been there and done that\" rides. These days, there isn't quite the bustle of heavy commercial shipping sharing the same harbour as there was 30 years ago, but it's still a busy area, with all sorts of ships criss-crossing with the ferries. Stunning views of the HK & Kowloon skylines, and if you want a special treat, do the ferry run in the evening, between 8 & 8:30 and take in the free light show, when some of the most iconic buildings in the world put on some amazing animated illuminations.

It only cost around 4HKD one way for the upper deck which I highly recommend for the view. The lower deck cost 3HKD. You can pay woth your Octopus card. It only takes 10-15 mins to cross the sea from Tsim Tsa Tsui to Central.They also offers harbour tour which cost around 100HKD. They have this tour even for the Symphony of light!The ferry station is very accesible via MTR Tsim tsa Tsui station."

From the first time I rode it in 1972 until today, the Star Ferry has got to be the most efficient, reasonable and scenic ferry boat ride in Asia if not the world (OK, the Staten Island Ferry is free and has some pretty good sights, and the Swiss lake boats are superb, but you'll seldom wait more than a minute or two for the Star Ferry). The cost is next to nothing compared to everything else these days, and the scenery (especially at night) is gorgeous. And, it seems the clean, well-maintained ferry boats haven't changed in nearly 45 years (probably 75 years). On this visit to Hong Kong, our first since 1988, it was Chinese New Year. I don't know if the crowds were related to that or if it's always that busy these days. But, if you're buying tokens, get them for the round trip (or all future expected trips) at one time. The lines to the token machines can be quite long. If you're staying for a while and are a senior, look into the Octopus Card for this and other transportation discounts. Forget the subway. Go the old way."

Especially considering that a normal ride costs $2 HKD, it's a pretty big price jump for very similar experiences. I did it both ways, and the special boat ride is a nicer boat and they stop in the middle to see the show, but the normal boat has basically the same view. I'm not convinced a boat is the best way to see the lights anyway, so my suggestion would be to spend the money on a nice dinner on the harbor instead to get the most of the beautiful skyline"

I quickly made my way to the open area in the middle of the ship allowing for a clearer view of the bay and skyline than the plastic covered windows. The trip will cost you a few dollars and if you don't have an Octopus card you will have to buy a token to get through the turn style. The trip is quick, probably less than 10 minutes but they are constantly running and I don't think i waited at the dock for more than 10 minutes."

For a ride not overtly strong in diesel fumes go for the top deck at a cost of $2:50 HKBottom deck is ok and cheaper at $1:70 HK, but the diesel fumes and engine noise obviously make it the budget option.

It is very inexpensive at 25p each way. Getting the token was confusing. We had to watch others and then a kind Chinese lady explained what we had to do. The machine isn't in English like the MTR. A quick and inexpensive way to cross the harbour and the walk from the landing stage on Hong Kong Island takes you into The Landmark which leads to the cleanest toilet (all marble) I've ever seen, so it was worth it for that! The walkway takes you over the 5 lane road and into various locations. Brilliant idea. Like a walkway in the sky."

We paid the Super Class fare (about HK$325) and took the 9:00 departure. Reserved seats second level and a snack came with the hefty price but was worth leaving earlier by 2.5 hours. If possible, suggest you reserve in advance to avoid the long wait and extra charges. Getting around Macau was really easy with all the buses provided by the hotels. Seemed each hotel had its own bus so was fast and a short ride. Tons of people on Macau and some of the hotels/casinos were EXACTLY like the sister hotel in Las Vegas.

Instead of joining local cruise tour, taking Star Ferry is another good way to enjoy at cheap fares, just few HKD. It's a ten minutes boat ride from Tsim Sha Tsui to Wanchai (the best route). If there's exhibition held in HK Convention Centre, you can visit at the same time. This is a way a lot more easier/ nearer than to walk from Wanchai MTR station.

There is 360 degree view of one of the world's famous harbour at very low fare price. The trip is less than 15 minutes. It is relaxing and ventilated by breezes, there is an air conditioned compartment for passengers in Summer.At both sides of the harbour, connections to many popular places are available. For instance, connection to Victoria Peak (Tai Ping Shan) by bus or peak tram are within walking distance on the Hong Kong Island Side. As one go up the peak, detail picture of the city down under is quite fascinating. On Kowloon side, there is Tsimshatsui where Space Museum, Art Museum, Ocean Terminal and waterfront promenade leading to History Museum are enough for a day's exploration. This is always wonderful for visits again and again."

From these vintage ferries, one views the gorgeous Hong Kong skyline during either the day or night(suggest sampling both!). There's little not to like...views, ocean, interesting people-watching. Shopaholics can catch or take the ferry to Central(shops galore) or to Tsim Sha Tsui (more shops and malls). In the latter, one can extend the view and walk along the facilities outside of the Cultural Center. If wishing to avoid the shops and commotion, one can catch the ferry to Wanchai and enjoy the exhibits at the Convention Center."

The Star Ferry services from Tsimshatsui to Central and Wanchai on the Island side - particularly the former - have been a must-do for all visitors to Hong Kong for decades. The recent extensive land reclamation on the Island side not only made the ride shorter, but also made the walk from the pier to the business area much much longer, to the point of being a little boring: a lot of people find the underground a lot more desirable for efficiency for crossing the harbour. That said, it's as much of the heart and soul of Hong Kong, much like Time Square in NYC, and has to be experienced."

Seeing the traditionally dressed staff jabber in Cantonese as they throw the lines is much more fun. The unique two way technology that allows these boats to go back and forth without turning is also interesting. As a result, the deck chairs flip back and forth depending on the direction.

Hong Kong urban area is very dense and makes it a wonderful place to explore on foot, but one of the best views is on the water. No need to take a tour though. Instead of taking a cab or MTR (their subway system), take the Star Ferry. It will give you an amazing view of the city. Best time to go is when it's not rush hour, so that you have more chances to move about and take photos, videos or sit back and take it all in. Go during the day, but definitely make your way at night as well, as the city lights up and the reflection off the water is just gorgeous."

Taking a star ferry across the straight from Kowloon to HK or reverse not only gives you a short moment of peace and fresh air in a city where both are highly scarce but it also reconciles you with the city and might even make you fall in love with it. It's indeed imprinted in nostalgia but above all it gives you sensational views on the city and plunges you in the sounds and smells of Hong Kong. Don't consider it a waste of time compared to the ferry. You will not regret the extra time it takes as the rewards are big. Best time to do it is at night once the peak traffic and passenger flow is over but while all the buildings are still lighted up. On all my business trips to HK several times a year I always try to do it once."

Tip: the cultural centre has public washrooms & they stay open late. Signage isn't the greatest at the TST ferry terminal & but there is a tourist centre there if you have questions. If you do research ahead of time you will know which ferry to board to get you where you need to go. It's older form of transport so not sleek or new but it does the job.

The ferry pier was moved some distance away from its original spot in Central a few years ago and this has been to its detriment. This said, the journey itself takes in the stunning views of the two sides of the harbour and on a clear day (or night) they are amazing.The ferry is used by regular commuters and costs only a few Hong Kong dollars. The ageing, yet safe boats (all with 'Star\" in their names) have two decks. The Upper Deck is slightly more expensive and will give the better views but the lower is more interesting for watching the skillful seamen speedily berthing and casting off. Take your camera and hope for a clear day and you will get some memorable shots."

Taking the Ferry was not only convenient but relaxing and romantic. Not anymore. With massive reclamation, Queen's Pier was dismantled and the old ferry terminal was pushed so far out into the sea that taking the ferry was no longer sensible. Now walking to the pier means a ten to fifteen minutes walk from Queen's Road Central, not a joy under the hot sun and wearing city shoes. I only do it for nostalgic reasons. With the narrowing of the harbour, the currents get stronger and the crossing is more bumpy. The journey ends before one realizes. Who is the killer? The stupidity of the government\uff1fThe greed of big business? Civil society remonstrated but to no avail. What a shame and tragedy!"

It takes about 10 minutes to cross the Harbour and the cost is $3.4 Hong Kong dollars. Avoid to take it from 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm because it's the time for most people to travel back from office to home."

Mostly work. Those who \"play\" on the other side of the harbor typically take cabs. They can afford them. For visitors, it's the most fun and authentic way to get across the harbor. And you get the most amazing photo ops, not just the breathtaking Hong Kong skyline but the \"real\" Hong Kong that surrounds you. For some added authenticity, take the lower deck on one of your trips!"

The main ferry plies between Central and Ocean terminal in Kowloon and takes about 10 minutes. Fare used to be HKD1.00 but was recently increased to HKD2.00 - how do they do it? Buy your tokens from the vending machine and join the Q which moves very quickly. The seats are reversible so just swing it the way you are heading - the ferry itself does not turn around but goes back in the opposite direction."

Part of me wants to give the Star Ferry a bad review because it seems to be a little overrated everywhere and certainly there must be better things to do in such a large and fascinating city. Truth is, it is ah honest, fun and inexpensive glimpse into Hong Kong life offering a unobstructed view of HK's iconic skyline. In fact much of Hong Kong's public transport make memorable moments to your stay. The double decker trams and buses, the subway, the midlevel escalators, Victoria peak tram, jetfoil to Macau and airport express train all all worth doing as well. It's the journey not the destination they say, and you should make the Star ferry part of your journey, but there are some cool less-visited gems to seek out: like the Monestary of 10,000 Buddhas or a hike along dragon's back that are both a journey and a destination to experience."

Now people can get aross on metro and other ways so use of the ferry system is way down. Fortunately we still have them, and in the original form! The cost is 2 HK$ a ride for the shortest and most popular route just across. You can use your Octopus stored card, or buy a token from a machine and then put the blue plastic token in to enter. The ferry runs frequently and its a nice ride across the bay. You should do it at least once, as your card you use for the metro is the same as for the ferry."

With cost of transportation so cheap, around 3HKD per trip, it is one of the best gems of Hong Kong to forget the hustle and bustle of city life and enjoy the great view of harbour any time of the day.Use Octopus card, it will coat you around 9HKD to rent available at HKIA train ticket office. Very handy card to use for buses, airport express trains, subways, star ferry and even the peak trams. Ensure that balance in the card is less than 500HKD to get your cash back smoothly otherwise more complex procedure....you have been warned.Only few minutes walk from Hong Kong Central station to pier 8 star ferry, the train travel from airport to Central station takes around 30 minutes. From same pier you can take bus to lower terminus the peak tram, another great Hong Kong experience but without the timing certainty of Star Ferry.Sit on the right side of the Ferry from Tsim Tsa Tsui to Hong Kong Central to catch view of Hong Kong skyscrapers.Truly memorable experience and if you only have 1 or 2 things to experience in Hong Kong, this should be one of them."

Completely understandable though, Kai Tak had outgrown its limits and I am not sure it would pass any risk assessment these days, ho hum.Anyway, back to the Star Ferry. On Hong Kong side, the terminal is now reached by a rather dull walkway that goes on just a bit too long. One of the joys of the ferry was its accessibility, it brought you almost to the door of the Mandarin Oriental. Now it is about a quarter of a mile distant and I am not sure why you would choose to use it over the MTR to get to Kowloon nowadays if time is your focus.It is worth the effort though as the journey across one of the world's great harbours for a couple of dollars is good value indeed.

We did one deck each way. In good or bad weather its a good activity (we went in a rainy day) and the shopping on the Kowloon side is nice.It is a 1940's restored ferry and has been nicely restored.

While in Hong Kong in early December 2015, we used the Star Ferry to cross from Central terminal to Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon and again from Tsim Sha Tsui to Wanchai terminal on Hong Kong Island\u2026both during the evening. Both routes cost the same. Said cost is minimal for a breezy 10 minute-or-so ride\u2026about 32 cents in USD. There are two decks \u2013 the upper with closable windows and bench seating and the lower with open sides and bench seating as well. The water-level views of the Hong Kong waterfront are spectacular, especially after dark and with all the buildings sporting holiday lighting akin to Las Vegas or Times Square in New York City\u2026quite a spectacular view. The ferries run so frequently and carry a large enough number of passengers that, in our experience, crowds at each boarding facility are very small. Getting aboard as well as getting off is smooth and efficient. We liked riding on the lower level with the breeze in our faces. On inclement days, the upper deck is clearly the best option. Use the Octopus card for your fares. The Octopus card is an essential part of moving around the city whether on the ferry, MTR, trolley, or bus. It can also be used for small purchases in the convenience stores located throughout Hong Kong (Yes, there are lots of 7 Elevens there). Monetary value can be added to the cards at 7 Elevens as well. Besides being a quick and inexpensive way to cross the Harbor the Star Ferry is a fun, iconic way to see the city. Don\u2019t leave Hong Kong without this great experience!"

The Star Ferry's fame and noteworthiness place it into the same category of historic forms of transportation that have also become an attraction in itself, similar to San Francisco's cable cars. However unlike the cable cars, the Star Ferry is much less a tourist attraction and much more of a fun way to get from A to B. There are ferries departing from Kowloon to Hong Kong every few minutes or so, tickets can be bought at the pier or using an MTR Octopus card for more convenience. A crossing costs something less than $0.50 USD? They take about 7 minutes and you can enjoy the voyage either on the outdoor lower deck, indoor cabin upper deck for some great views of the skyline. The ferries themselves are all more than 50 years old, they have wooden bench style seats and are built reminiscent of the old ferryboats that use to cross rivers and bays in the early 20th century before modern engineering allowed steel bridges and tunnels to connect people over water. Ride the ferry if your in Hong Kong, even if you don't have intentions of going anywhere across the harbor, just take it back and forth for the fun of it."

I took the ferry from Hong Kong Island (Pier 7 I believe) to Kowloon at night to see the light show. It gives you a great view of both skylines and may even be a better view than Victoria Peak. It is certainly a more intimate view. The ride is fairly quick, maybe 15 minutes (or maybe it just seemed so). It lets off on the Kowloon side very close to where you would watch the evening light show. On the way to Hong Kong Island, it lets off near the Central MTR station. Don't miss it and I recommend doing it at night."

Each day, this beloved ferry system makes its way gently across Victoria Harbor cheaply and efficiently. The original Ferry in 1888, traveled from Pedders Wharf (Central) to Tsim Sha Tsui (Kowloon), a vessel known as The Morning Star! This trip took about an hour on the early coal-powered ferry, which was owned by a company originally known as the Kowloon Ferry Company. For the greatest part of it's life, The Star Ferry (4th generation) was located at Edinburgh Place and is only way to see the intensity of this amazing city, as you step out of the hustle and bustle for 9 minutes gently floating across the water, allowing you to take in the spirit of the harbour from a far."

It has fresh air and relaxation. Better than travel by MTR to encounter a lot of travelers and felt suffocated.Anyone visits Hong Kong should go to travel with the Star Ferry and enjoy the journey.I can guarantee you will enjoy every minute."

My recommendation is of course to take the ferry at night where it is cool and the Hong Kong Skyline will wow you."

During the nighttime, we were visiting the tsim sha tsui and took the ferry across to admire the Hong Kong skyline. Unfortunately we couldn't find the entrance to the lower deck so we settled for the upper deck. I find the lower deck to give better views and since you are closer to the water, it is much better experience than the upper deck, which feels enclosed. The view of the HK skyline is fantastic. During the day, we managed to take the lower deck. A cheap and great way of experiencing Hong Kong."

The boats leave every 5 minutes or so, are always clean, and in the summer, the front cabins on the boats are air-conditioned. All this for a princely sum of HK$2.50 on weekdays and HK$3.40 on weekends and public holidays. That's US$0.30 - 0.45 per passenger for 1st Class! It really is a MUST DO when visiting, or even when you live here."

While you don't necessarily need to take the Star Ferry between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon (as you can simply take the MTR), it is a lovely experience that is definitely worth doing at least once (although I would recommend going at least twice - once in each direction). The ride is short but the ferry's long history makes it feel special and genteel. Cutting out across the busy harbour also gives you a shiver of excitement as you see boats coming and going all around you. And of course the views are absolutely fantastic, especially on the return trip from Kowloon, especially at dusk.It's easy to find the ferry terminals and you can use your Octopus Card (from the MTR) to access the Star Ferry for convenience. It's charming, historic, not too bouncy and the benches on the boat are reversible so you never have to sit backwards. Oh, and be sure to sit on the top level!"

For the cheap fare that it's charging, you won't be able to get a better view than this. This is a must-do, to take a ferry ride from here in the evening.

Everyone tells you to take this ride and yes you should, but my top tips are do it at night when the view of HK is lit up by all the skyscrapers and try and get on the top deck as it has better views, is usually less crowded, has nicer seating, usually a better breeze (with a closed in section too if for some amazing reason its cold) and you don't get the smell from the engine. To get to the top deck though you have to take a different entrance so when you get to the pier look for 'upper deck entrance', it's not immediately obvious, you will also need to take the stairs so not good for strollers unless you can carry them. The cost for this trip is ridiculously cheap and you can get up and walk around and take photos but hang on when it comes into dock! The ferry runs regularly throughout the day but I believe the last one is just before midnight. There is usually a lot of life going on around the Star Ferry piers and at night you will find many buskers on both sides of the water. On the HK side you can easily grab a drink from any of the piers (Pier 3 has the best bar for outdoor drinking, and has a bar on top of the pier too serving food & sometimes live music) and then relax on the steps watching the ferry and listening to music, its a great place for a sundowner after a long day:)"

It goes from Central to Tsim Sha Tsui, in 5 minutes and is very frequent. Do avoid the peak hour as it can get very crowded. It is still one form of public transport and is not exclusive to tourists.

Unparallelled views from onboard of both the Hong Kong and Kowloon skylines, plus it's safe, fast, and cheap. There are also other private ferries that offer harbor cruises with snacks, drinks, even meals, but you're going for the trip and the view, not the party, right? There is also a subway route under the Harbor, but that has absolutely no character or charm, so unless the weather is typhoon-like on the surface, don't use it. The Star Ferry Company goes all the way back to the 1890's, and was founded by an East Indian businessman. From it's very beginning, all Star ferries have been built with both bow and stern having the same shape, allowing the boats to move in either direction."

Top deck or lower deck - both are splendid. My only complaint is they've painted one ferry from the traditional green & white to a garish multicolored design. Hopefully, it's just temporary.If nothing else, it's a splendid quick tourist attraction that must be seen by anybody going to Hong Kong harbour."

Since that time my crossing in Hong Kong have become trips on a time machine, in a suspended atmosphere enclosed by the breathtaking landscapes of the southern pearl, surrounded by discrete presences of old seamen, really creatures from myths of the southern seas, and lulled by the old wood made alive by the benign sea giant of my child dreams in the engine room.Take lower deck next time you board Star Ferry ;-)"

Simply take the star ferry which costs you only US$0.5 per trip to go between HK Island & Kowloon peninsular. The ride gives you fabulous view of the harbour and the city."

The Star Ferry, also iconic to HK has been carrying passengers across the harbour since the 1880s. It is a great & inexpensive trip for visitors to HK who want a leisurely journey to either side. It is picturesque and slow enough to take ample photographs.However for regular commuters, this service has unfortunately declined over the past 10 years and this is especially evident in the berthing where once it was extremely fast and efficient, now the process is painfully slow and erratic. This is a pity for an attraction that shows off Hong Kong at its best."

The best way to get around on public transport in Hong Kong is to buy an Octopus card. It works similar to the Oyster card for public transport in London.

However, one of the the boats is modified (you and stand in the open on the rear deck) and leaves from pier 9 and does a 1 hour tour of the whole harbour for just 90 HKD! I was flabbergasted that it was so cheap (same thing on the Thames would be about \u00a330) and gave truly awesome views of all of Hong Kong. It doesn't seem to be well known so you have to hunt out the ticket place near the Maritime Museum. I think the first ferry departs for the Island at 12:15pm. They also do two evening cruises around 6:30 and 9pm (roughly) at a cost of c.180HKD. You get a free soft drink included - bonus!"

The short trip is always pleasurable with good views of the harbour. And it's cheap.A lot of visitors of Hong Kong don't realise, from the Kowloon side, this is the cheapest way to get to the popular place called Nan Kwai Fong (a very popular place for tourists) on the Hong Kong island. Many in their ignorance spend hundreds of dollars in Taxis. Instead, you just cross the harbour in the ferries. Then, follow a long and continuous walkway for about 5 minutes and cross a couple of main streets, and you are there.Different weather conditions naturally give you different experiences travelling on the ferries, from calm sailing in good sunny weather to rocky journey in stormy weather. The lower deck is exciting because you are nearer the water and you breathe the fresh sea air. And if you are lucky, you can even get splashed by the waves when the ferry hits them."

The cheap first class upper deck fare is the ultimate in value for money. Ornate wooden signs remind patrons in hand-painted white English and Cantonese characters Please Do Not Spit that enforces the sense of ambient comfort. As we gently bobbed, rocked, dipped, and bounced our way across the harbour, coolies balanced themselves with precarious ease, honed from years of experience, atop the Hong Kong Island quayside, their long bamboo poles held outstretched to hook the seeped mooring lines thrown fore and aft. The Star Ferry has preserved its original look, feel, and smell since the 1960's when the ferries were the main form of transport to cross the harbour between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. To gaze up from a ferry crossing at Hong Kong's majestic skyline, an erratic stretch of skyscrapers, hotels and apartment blocks, transformed at night when Hong Kong glitters like a diamond, is the cheapest therapy in town; few people disembark in anything but the lightest of moods."

You leave Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon and end up in Central on the Hong Kong side. The cost is very low. 2 HK dollars. With that in mind I read that their revenue was close to 42 million dollars a year up to the relocation of the pier and now has fallen into big loses.It is still very popular but not as crowed since 2011. Even though you could take a cab much faster I recommend you use it. The token you use to get on board is distributed at the entrance and it looks like a plastic coin. Enjoy."

Although today's ferry mainly for tourist purpose and local people won't take it as main transportation to cross the harbour but when you know that it was the only way to go between Kowloon and HK before cross harbour tunnel was built it really means a lot and a signature of HK's transportation history.Frankly, today's traveling time is mush shorter than the old days because the landscape has changed due to coast development on both sides. Taking her ferry at different times in a day will catch different views of Victoria Harbour."

It is the cheapest scenic harbour ride you can get. It was awesome way back then and it is just as fun (and cheap) now.Yes, the train through the tunnel (which didn't exist way back when) is faster and more convenient. You also don't assaulted by the suit tailors and dodgy watch sellers when you get off the ferry in Kowloon - but that is half the fun. The train is more expensive though. This is a must do! Enjoy it. Try the upper and lower decks."

There are shopping centres on both sides. Not much choice but shopping. It is Hong Kong ~ Shopping paradise. You just cannot resist especially during the summer or winter sale period.

This brief crossing of the Fragrant Harbour is one of the supreme pleasures of life. Do yourself a favor and come during the dawn on weekends. There's nearly nobody here. But service continues with better regularity and more frequency than a NY subway. At less than 50 US cents, this is an unbelievably cheap way to take in a bit of the colonial air."

As a local, we have a lot of attachment to this slow but nostalgic mode of transport. The ride not what it used to be after further reclamation in the harbour and the elevation of the ire on the Hong Kong side to its present day location , but it does offer the best view of the harbour. The price is still cheap and for that price I would recommend it. You can start by paying a visit to the harbour city or ocean terminal if you need shopping done, or visit the Heritage 1881 mall and have lunch at the hotel, then saunter to the pier. I normally take the upper deck, but the lower deck feels more romantic, I suspect it hasn't changed much from day 1! The ride is pretty short nowadays (about or under 5 mins) and I often take a return journey back to the kowloon side to soak in the sights again. It rob ably doesn't matter from which side you start, although I always preferred starting from kowloon to see the magnificent skyscrapers of central .On the hk side, follow the pedestrian walkway to ifc and then through to hang seng bank all the way up to the escalator to the mid levels - great exercise and good views of the toothpick buildings in that dates. The expats have done a great job with the ambience by setting up bars and eateries ."

While every guide to Hong Kong recommends to ride the Star Ferry, it is mostly used by locals. Reason being that the Star Ferry costs less than the MTR. While MTR is great transportation, the views from the Star Ferry are unbeatable! The fare is $2.5 HK M-F and $3.4 HK weekends and holidays. For about .30 to .40 US$, you can ride this ferry, cross the harbour, and sightsee, all at the same time. Also, the Star Ferry Company is over 135 years old!"

I have used this form of transport each time I visit HK, to travel from one side to the other and I never tire of it. As the green and white double decker boats readies itself, the bell goes for the seven minute journey, weaving its way through large and small craft, while you admire the Hong Kong skyline.Now thanks to land reclamation the Star Ferry piers are closer together than ever. On the Hong Kong side, Central Pier at Pier 7 opened in 2006, close to the Airport Express Hong Kong Station and the IFC. On the Kowloon side the terminal is at the beginning of the Waterfront area. There are 12 boats in the Star Ferry fleet all with different names so take note each time you use it and note down the names for fun!"

Not the fastest, but on a clear day if you're not in a rush, probably the most enjoyable way to travel between Central and Tsim Sha Tsui for just a couple of HK$. Along with the trams, these are some of the remaining historic sights of Hong Kong. Some of the ferries are 60 years old, which - by Hong Kong standards - means antique! Most people sit on the upper deck where there is an airconditioned cabin, but all the action takes place on the LOWER deck (open air) where you experience all the harbour smells, noise and activity of a working ferry. (It's also a few cents cheaper on the lower deck.) You need to board from the lower level of the ferry pier - follow the signs for lower deck - once on board you can't move between decks. The best views are towards Hong Kong Island, so leaving Central Star Ferry Pier (take the elevated walkway from IFC or Exchange Square), sit at the stern, and vice versa from TST side back to the Island, sit at the bow. The view on a clear night is also spectacular, and it's easier to take photos from the lower deck as there are no windows to cause reflections."

People had to use star ferry to cross the harbour for going to work before the Cross Harbour Tunnel was opened in 1972. People had to rush home from work when there is a typhoon, otherwise they will get stuck on either the Hong Kong Island or the Kowloon side.Now there are other ways to cross the harbour but star ferry is the most relaxing one, especially on a sunny day or in the evening. On the Kowloon side get out of Tsim Sha Tsui East exit and there's a tunnel that leads you to 2 blocks away from the ferry pier. From the Hong Kong Island side there's a footbridge from the Star Ferry Pier to International Finance Centre (IFC), and from there you can get down to Hong Kong Station which is connected to Central station underground.Tip: Go to the upper deck. There's air con at one end, the view is nicer and there's more sea wind."

The view either direction from the middle of Hong Kong harbor is worth the effort, go more than once. With the massive increase in the population and commerce of Hong Kong, I'm not sure how long these will really be in existance, use them to cross the harbor while you can."

Something not to miss in Hong Kong and probably the cheapest attraction you will find on earth - for just $2 HKD you can cross the bay from Tsim Sha Tsui to Hong Kong Central station. Covered pathway from there takes you to much of the central Hong Kong or you can enjoy the air conditioning at the mall. Peak Tram is also quite a short walk from there as well.There is also a 90 minute tour of Hong Kong that you can take but I haven't done it. Even if you're sea sick and cannot tolerate bouncing on the waves this quick journey is for you.Don't let the look of the facilities on Tsim Sha Tsui turn you away from this treasure, it's absolutely worth it. Just make sure you bring some small change because I believe that the biggest currency the token dispensing machine takes is $20 HKD."

But it also lets you see the city come alive with all the thousands of lights in the buildings - for me makes the bustling city so much more attractive at this time of day. For a few dollars, purchase a token at Kowloon and hop across the Harbour. Stay for a drink, or have a quick walk along the island waterfront near the wheel. Great photo opportunity and good way to relax after hectic day of shopping."

Star Ferry pier at Tsim Sha Tsui has a number of jetties where you can catch the ferry to Central, Admiralty, North Point and more on Hong Kong island. The service is cheap and fares are one way - make sure you go to the token machines to buy your fare before attempting to gain access to the pier as the gates can only be opened once you have inserted the appropriate token for either concession (senior, child etc) or adult. If you are travelling with more than one person, you may press the \"multiple\" button on the machine, so you may buy all tokens at once.... a great help when you have not got the correct change !! Each pier/ferry has its own platforms. There are two - one for upper deck (take this one if you want to sit on the top floor of the ferry!!) and one for lower deck (don't worry - the lower one is just fine too - in fact not as crowded and it is not closed in, still really good!) You need to choose which one AGAIN BEFORE going through the turnstiles ! ALSO beware that if you choose upper deck platform, and go to the ticket machine here - it is more expensive than lower deck. If you buy your token on the lower deck platform, and try to go through the upper deck platform turnstiles, you WILL NOT GET THROUGH."

Just if You start to proceed from the corner of Nathan Road and Salisbury Road, first glancing at the extravagant Hotel \" Peninsula\" with its characterstic green ornaments on the facade( the landmarks of the famous company Rolls - Royce -Bentley), and all the time in direction of the west, before long, You'll get to the Star Ferry Pier.Here is located the \"Star\" Ferry Company, that is, the passenger ferry service operator.It carries You every day, several times during the day, across the Victoria Harbour, from the Kowloon to Hong Kong Island.There are twelve ferries in the fleet. What I suggest You, is to be on time for departure or returning from Island ,with proper bought tokens, since it might be a confused situation, if You've got by mistake some other ticket and go to some other place,also across the waters of the Harbour.Whole thing is in the fact, that exist the two Piers, from which the Ferries undertake their voyages toward the Hong Kong Island.Usually, they ( the ferries) are the green and white coloured, also the red ones are in the traffic. They have got two decks, upper and lower, and naturally all the tourists rush, if they only could take the places on the upper deck. And when You get to the goal,either on the Island or at the Piers of the Star Ferry, there is a crew, that is in the charge to moor ferry at the metal deck on the shore ( the piers) with the billhooks.The views around You, while You're floating on the ferry, are fantastic, specially in the evening hours, with all these scintillating lights, coming from the skyscrapers on the Island and from buildings in Kowloon, as well.So with some light drink and camera to take shots for the memory, we have had really good time."

In the few years we have left before they pave over the harbor completely and we're walking from Central to Tsimshatsui, make sure you do a few trips on the ferry, which just costs a couple of HK dollars. Everybody is on there, from the violinist drinking a beer after his concert, going home, to the executive, to the door man at the Marriott, to the students holding hands, and so on. The Hong Kong skyling is striking and this is one way to see it, nearly for free. The ride used to take seven minutes, now I think we down to a reduced 3.5 minutes, but however short it is, you must do it -- several times if you can. A Hong Kong top ten thing. Related: on the tsimshatsui side, take a walk on the raised walkway to the east of the ferry station: good views and photo ops for shots of the harbor. Enjoy."

It was comical at best, annoying at worst. The crew weren't really interested in the passengers and like me look like they didn't want to be there. From a purely sight seeing interest it's ok but anything more than that it's horrible. The boats themselves are 50 yrs old or more and not really comfortable to sit down on for more than 10 mins.

Mixed with locals and tourists, the hustle and bustle to get and and off is part of the fun. The turn around time is so quick you could. It's one if you blink, but it's ok they are so regular and reliable you will be across soon. In less than 10 minutes and with great sky line and harbour line views take your camera, a must for all."

The breeze you get from this open travel makes the journey so refreshing. I think its important to try out everything when on holidays. All the star ferries have their own names, and its fun to remember the journey as something particular to each ferry. I love how the backs of the seats are interchangeable so that you can always face whichever way you prefer to. The star ferries are always on my to-do list when I am visiting Hong Kong.

Taking the Star Ferry every day is one of the nicest ways to unwind from the bustle of Asia's biggest financial centre ... and it goes way back ... I remember my school friends in UK talking to each other about the ferry, so crossing the harbour the slowest (and cheapest!) way is very nostalgic. Not many cities offer the opportunity to cruise across their downtown area, Star Ferry does just that. It's a short excursion, but a must-do, connecting some of the prime shopping areas in HK. Going from TST to Central gives you the best access to other areas you'll want to visit. However going between TST and WanChai gives you a longer ride with a clearer view of the impressive harbour front and the new WanChai Exhibition Centre. If you're lucky you might see the traditional sailing junk run by the HK Tourist Board, to give you the iconic old-and-new photo that you have to take home with you."

This was slightly annoying and could be rectified by talks and agreement between operators as the minimal Star Ferry fare could be incorporated in the cost of the tourist ticket with little loss of revenue to MTR.The Harbour was quiet on a Saturday afternoon but is often bustling with maritime activity.The Star Ferry is one of many British legacies to be commended."

I was staying on the Kowloon side of the harbor, and wanted to go across to Hong Kong to take the Peak Tram up to the Peak, so I boarded the ferry at Tsim Sha Tsui. My mistake was getting on the ferry that goes to Wan Chai. I should have boarded the ferry that goes to 'Central', which is closer to the Peak Tram. I ended up having to take the subway to Central, and then still had quite a long walk to the Peak Tram ticket office.The Star Ferry, though, was most enjoyable. It has real old character, takes about 15 mins to cross the harbor, and the cool breeze that blows across the harbor was most welcome as this was a very humid time of the year."

Having lived in Hong Kong for a number of years till July 2014), I know very well that the Star Ferry which started in the late-1800s, is probably the fastest and most efficient ferry in the world. For those who remember the opening scene of the movie, \"The World of Suzy Wong\", the same ferries traverse Victoria Harbour! You have a choice to take the ferry to Kowloon from Wanchai or Central (depending where you are staying on Hong Kong Island - the hotels around Wanchai are cheaper than Central). If you are taking the ferry from Kowloon (Tsim Sha Tsui) and plan to head to Mid-levels and the restaurants of Soho, take the ferry to Central...But for the cheap price and the awesome view of Hong Kong Island, there is no better mode of transportation. Try to take the ferry at night, so you can view the beautiful skyline view of Hong Kong!"

During the ferry travel in evening hours (post 7 pm), you even get to capture beautiful pictures of both the sides of harbor (refer to pictures I've taken). Also just to update this ferry services are also connecting other areas of Hong Kong as well and the fare is quite cheap (one way 2-3$ ) for most of the location.In case you're in Hong Kong and need to travel across the harbor (either side) then do not miss the opportunity to travel through Star Ferry"

With each trip, you are offered a beautiful scenery over the Victoria harbour, which you probably won't see taking the subway. The platforms on both sides, where you can board from is also really interesting to see. So it might be nice to arrive a little early for your planned departure to the other side, to have a look around.

The location could not be better as you have a range of bus stops within a short that will bring you to other parts of the island.

We were really lucky to have great weather on the day and bought the ticket from the booth when we arrived. If you don't have much time, its an excellent option for taking in the view. The ferry wasn't busy at all so we sat on the deck for the whole trip - a great way to take lots of photos. As part of your ticket, you're treated to a refreshment (drink and a snack). "

Please read through to the end for why an evening trip across on the Star Ferry is \"must do\".While this was my wife's first visit to Hong Kong, I have been here many times. The first were as a young U.S. naval officer in 1978, conning a ship into this busy port on several occasions....pretty exciting and lots of great memories of those times.The most recent time was as part of a trip through China with my Mom the year before she passed. In 1993 mainland China had just opened to tourists, so we opted to go on a 3 week tour, ending up in Hong Kong. Accompanying our group throughout was a very bright young American man, completely fluent in both Cantonese and Mandarin, and very knowledgeable.When we reached Hong Kong, he made us promise to take an evening Star Ferry crossing and enjoy the city views by night from the water (it cost only about 25 cents then, and is the same today). He was quite persistent about getting us to do it.Later he told us this story.Many years ago there was an American ex-pat businessman crossing back over from Kowloon to the Hong Kong island side with his dog, enjoying the view and breezes from the upper deck. A young American woman, who was temporarily teaching English in Hong Kong asked if she could pet his dog.They fell in love, and our young tour guide was their son.It is still just as beautiful and special to once again experience and remember this romantic situation....with my best friend and love of my life.Highly recommended"

The price for a one way is $3.40 HKD - so inexpensive and you get to enjoy the sea air and the view of the waterfront. The lights are great on both sides but particularly the HK side so the trip back from Kowloon is beautiful in both the day and night. It is a fun trip amongst the locals and you are right in the tourist district on the Kowloon side. Of course one can also take the Star Ferry directly to Central on the HK side so you are right downtown as you disembark at central to. I prefer this to the MTR although if you want to be up higher on Nathan Street - you have an interesting walk - about 800k to get up to Cameron Road"

The Star Ferry is almost a tradition as its been going for close to 150 years , if you are over 65 its free if not it will cost the grand sum of about HKD2:60 for the upper deck , you must try it the view is great as you cross the harbour .One catches the ferry at the Star Ferry terminal on Kowloon just near Ocean Terminal if you are staying on Kowloon which is the mainland and if you are staying on the Island the ferry terminal is in Central you can't miss it."

            "review": "A hint of the past amid the modern skyline. Everyday some million people cross the Vitoria Harbour between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island by car, bus or subway. A few thousand choose to time-travel this short stretch of water by boarding one of the Star Ferries that cross from one of the several piers both on the island and the mainland.The most used access to the Star Ferries are the one in Tsim Sha Tsui, the Central Pier in Central Hong Kong and the renewed Wanchai Pier (recently moved of a few hundred meters from the original place). The inside of the Ferry Piers is bare and functional, but still with the flavour of the past.The crossing itself doesn\u2019t take more than 15 minutes, but the experience is one of the best in HK. The best direction, in my opinion, is from TST to Wanchai because the ferry crosses the harbour in diagonal, showing on the right side (starboard) the wonderful skyline of HK slowly unfolding in front of your eyes.Every time of the day has its own charms: the morning with the neat, cold colours, the sharp shapes, the bright reflections; the sunset, with the golden sparks of the glass surfaces of the skyscrapers and the warm shadows. Every time I cross with a Star Ferry I\u2019m compelled to take some picture.The Ferries have been all built in the \u201850s / \u201860s and maintain the feeling of some of those Amazonian discovery expeditions. The funny shuttle shape, with bow and stern that share the same shape and function, the old fashioned green and white colours of the hull, the chimney on the top are one of the most characteristic and familiar views of HK.They offer some tourist rides as well, with the Harbour Tour both from TST or the Central Pier and a special ride during the Symphony of Lights at 8pm."

One of our favourite ways to enjoy Victoria Harbour is to take the Star Ferry Harbour Cruise, spending an hour slowing making our way around the harbour, enjoying views of skylines and just being on the water in one of Hong Kong's historic Star Ferry vessels. Star Ferry Harbour Cruises depart from the Star Ferry Pier at TST from 11.55-4.55pm (HK$90 per person), 5.55, 6.55,8.55pm (HK$170 per person) and the Symphony of Lights departure 7.55pm (HK$195 per person), with different departure times from the Central (20 minutes later) and Wan Chai (35 minutes later) based Star Ferry Piers. The cruises are slow, leisurely and come with a drink and packet of cookies. There is indoor seating if you want to escape the sun, heat or rain and you can spend as much time as you like at the two open ends of the ferry, taking pictures of the skylines, harbour and boat traffic for up to an hour when you the Star Ferry finished circling the harbour. The day cruise is best if sky conditions are favourable, Night trips are great as they show the Hong Kong Skyline at its best but they come at a much higher price. The Symphony of Lights show is not as good as it should be so we actually prefer to take earlier or later night sailings, saving on the higher price required to take the Symphony of Lights sailing. If you don't have time for a Star Ferry Harbour Cruise experience, you should try to take the Star Ferry crossing between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island at some point in your visit. The crossing takes no more than 10 minutes and is dirt cheap at HK$2.5 per adult, HK$1.5 per child passenger."

The Star Ferry was first initiated by a cheff (he came from nowadays Iran) that decided, in the late 19th century, to transport people to and from Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, using an old tag boat; later it was acquired by a transportation company, that built the first one deck ferries. Years later the second deck was added. The ferries have no stern, rather two bows, so they don't turn when they leave either the Kowloon or the HK docks, so pay attention to the simple chairs' back change of direction, making passengers always face the direction of sailing. Pay close attention to the old woodwork and the preservation. The Star Ferry is a very practical way of crossing from Kowloon to HOng Kong Island and backwards, only HK$2 per ride, you can use the Octopus card as well. Locals and Turists use it and it's very frequent."

Pennies to travel across to HK Island and they run every 10 minutes. I love the fact the crew are dressed in blue sailors outfits and each top is embroidered with a little white star at the rear.You purchase tokens from the ticket machine (which does give change unlike the buses in HK) - it was 2HK DOLLARS per person - down the gang plank, board, quickly find a seat and you're off. Great cool breeze which is great to escape the humidity and heat of the city in May.We always travelled in economy which is downstairs, it's only pence more to travel top deck - however depends how much you want your hair ruffling!I like to see the different walks of life on the ferry, people in business dress, tourists, locals - fabulous.You can get a bus which uses the tunnel in minutes but then why would you miss out on this great experience and see the skyline at the same time!"

Totally identifiable with Hongkong---one sight of a photo of the Star Ferry crossing the harbour and a light bulb flashes in one's mind, \"Hongkong!!!\" It's like riding history.I find the best view from the Star Ferry is the one that originates from Tsim Tsa Tsui, Kowloon side, going towards Hongkong Island. The Hongkong-side skyline is more impressive than the Kowloon-side skyline. I'm saying this so you can plan accordingly. Trust me, riding the subway from the Hongkong-side to the Kowloon-side is faster and entails considerably less walking. Take note: Red taxis service Hongkong Island. Green taxis service Kowloon and the new Territories. Blue taxis service Lantau island. Usually, the taxi drivers are very pleasant, but would rather not cross over."

The star ferry route was well signposted, much like other attractions, upon leaving Central MTR station at Exit A. The ferry trip was fairly short and offered great views of the harbour, and didn't cost more than $4 on a weekend rate, so even cheaper during the week. The ferries are so frequent that the boat was not filled to its full capacity. Get a seat on the top deck and sit on the right side (starboard) if facing the front of the ferry to get a great view of the harbour and city skyline (when departing from HK to Tsim Sha Tsui).I'd imagine doing the trip at night would be excellent for the views of the cityscape are better with all the lights on."

The nice wind in your face and the sun setting over the bay is the bes way to calm and take away all the day stress away.don't miss it , by any reason you need to cross the bay do it, it is a highl good experience.The view of Hong KOng Island from the ferry is something that you will keep in your eyes forever."

Victoria Harbour provides one of the top three night views in the world. You can take a look at either side of the harbour but you can also watch it from the Star Ferry. The ride takes 10-15 minutes between Central and Tsim Sha Tsui. All you need to do is to find a seat on the side of the ferry (don't choose the air-conditioned space). Then you can enjoy a magnificent view on the ride and take photos if you wish. There are a lot of sight-seeing spots in Central and Tsim Sha Tsui, so make sure you take a ride when you travel between these two places. In case you really find nothing interesting to do on the other side of the harbour, you can take another ride back. It takes only a few Hong Kong dollars for one ride."

The Star Ferry\u2019s single deck and double-deck boats run from the Kowloon clock tower to the Central pier and Wanchai and back from early morning to late evening.

The Hong Kong Island skyline and the Harbor are absolutely the most stunning sights of their kind in the world, with the possible exception of downtown Manhattan seen from Brooklyn or the Staten Island ferry.If you have to cross from the island to Kowloon (and as a tourist you will have to, probably several times), on at least one crossing skip the MTR and take the ferry. It's an experience that you'll remember as long as you live. Bring small coins, as the queues to buy tokens can be long. All the seatbacks on the Upper Deck (first class, about US 30 cents as of this writing) flip. Many people go to the front section, but better views are had on one side or the other (you have to try to figure this out as you board), and the center is a bit more stable in rough weather."

It costs around 50 cents each way and you can use small notes and coins to buy a token at the entrance to the terminal. Carry a small amount of $5 coins with you ($50 is enough) to make transport easier for you."

It is very easy to find the ferry, very cheap to ride the ferry, the ferry has frequent departure times, and it doesn't take long to cross the harbour (isn't this really more of a channel?). The mid-day ride was calm and fun. The evening ride was fun, but the water was getting pretty choppy and the gangplank was jumping quite a bit as we were boarding. The ferry moored on the opposite side of the terminal (which was not in use at the time) was getting the brunt of the waves and jumping and dropping over a meter with each wave.Cheap way to cross the harbour, especially if you are staying on Hong Kong Island and want to see some of the sights by foot in Kowloon/Tsim Sha Tsui."

This was once upon a time the only significant means to move between HK Island and the Kowloon Peninsula until the cross harbor tunnels arrived. The ferries are vintage white (top) and green (bottom). They are double deckers. The upper deck has an open air section in the middle, windowed and A/C-ed chambers at both ends (or fronts since they are symmetrical) in case of really bad rain and winds. The lower deck is all open air. You are at sea level, can smell diesel and see the engine room below. For best view, take the upper deck open air section, stay on the left side of the boat if you are heading towards Central on HK Island, and the right if you are coming towards TST Kowloon. Reason? Virtually all the scenic attractions are on one side. The ride is about 5 minutes or just a tad over. Together with the island trams and the Peak Tram, the Star Ferry is one of the three oldest (historic) mode of transportation still operating regularly in HK. The fare is really, really low. The Star Ferry is one of the very BEST way to experience HK. BTW, every boat in operation are more 50 years old!!"

If you want to take some amazing photos of both sides of the harbour, this is the way to go. It only costs you 2HK dollars to ride it. That is a little more than 25cents in the US. Do yourself a favor and ride the ferry. I must have ridden it back and forth 6 times my last day in Hong Kong back in November, just to keep trying to get some different shots with different boats cruising along beside us.

If you sat outside, the breeze, sometimes a bit muggy, blows through, and during wet seasons, tarpaulins are lowered, otherwise the rain comes at you horizontally. It used to be a vital means of transport for people rushing to go to work or to go home, across the harbour. Since the availability of the underground train, and the construction of a long park on the Hong Kong side, its uses for office workers in the central business district have diminished, and the Ferry now provides rides for people with lots of time on their hands, and tourists."

For less than a US dollar (0.35) a person, you can't get a better view. Depending on traffic, a cab ride across can take 30 minutes or more. They run every 10-15 minutes depending on day and time.You feel perfectly safe. Not practical for women in heels. A lot of the locals use it to commute, the subway is 2 city blocks from the Kowloon side, and if you are staying at the Peninsula hotel is about 2-3 blocks away as well. On the Downton side there is a cab stand in easy walking distance, just have your hotel write your destination, as the cab drivers only speak Mandarin.

The seniors travel free. Their elder octopus card is not charged. It is the most convenient way to travel across the harbour, A colonial experience, which gives you a good idea of what nostalgic Hong Kong was about.

While you can take that same trip via the MRT (subway), you certainly don't get the view or the ability to trek around the Avenue of the Stars for some nice peace and tranquil down time. With a cost of only $2HKD!, the ferries should be a part of everything you do while in HK. Be aware that the ferries have two loading platforms (top and bottom) and you cannot move from the bottom to the top (or vice versa) during the trip so make sure you choose the right loading platform"

What has changed is the traffic of boats in the sea around the area and the surrounding building works together with the land reclamations. It's still unbelievably cheap, and certainly quicker than car or taxi if you get your timings right."

            "review": "Great views at a low price - doesn't get any better than this. Ferries have been commercially plying the passages between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island for nearly 150 years. The Star Ferry, painted a familiar shade of green, maintains that tradition and remain an iconic symbol of the territory. Indeed, some of the ferries have been in service for over half a century. From a local's perspective, it's a convenient and extremely affordable means of daily transport. From a visitor's viewpoint, it's a very good way to feel the pulse of the city. Coupled with dynamite views of Hong Kong harbour on either side of the ferry, it's a ride that begs to be done at least once and is probably one of Hong Kong's best travel experiences.There are two separate Star Ferry routes - each return journey originates from the Kowloon side and heads for Central and Wan Chai, respectively. As the journey is fairly short, seasickness is unlikely to be a major problem. However, do beware of getting too close to diesel fumes, wet decks or generally impeding an occasionally impatient crowd at disembarkation. Although the turnstiles now take digital Octopus cards for payment, I find it much more nostalgic to pay cash and gain entry using the circular token system."

But it is covered so you can actually walk to IFC without getting wet in the rain.Its a HK most excellent must see. It also goes to wan Chai. I never got sick on it and I usually get sick on the bus, so probably you'll be OK if your worried about seasick.

The Ferry goes slow enough too to get great photos even while the boat is moving.One important caution, there are two Ferrys coming back to the main harbor, one takes you to the pier near the convention center and the Renaissance, the other takes you more central. So you have to be careful which one you get on. Also, the Ferry to the convention center stops running much earlier in the evening than the central Ferry, so, after 1030pm or so you will no longer have a choice of where to go, that said, you can easily take a cab from there anywhere on the waterfront and beyond."

You cannot go to Hong Kong and not do the Star Ferry ride across Victoria Harbour. Without question you can get some great photos on the ride towards Central on Hong Kong Island in the evening. The buildings are lit up and provide a glittering view. However, a gentle warning, quite frequently the smog/fog/pollution drifting down from China I obscure the view. It is cheap to ride the ferry and fun. But as functional transport there are much better options."

The Star Ferry is an iconic symbol of Hong Kong much as the Staten Island Ferry is in New York.The ferry runs between Hong Kong Island and the Mainland Peninsula with a few stops. It is an inexpensive, simple, and casual way to cross Victoria Harbor as opposed to the car tunnel under the harbor. There is an historical and romantic spirit about the Ferry. It has been running since about 1870. It was started by British businessmen, who were vital in the robust development of the Hong Kong as an industrial, trade, shipping and financial center of China. Locals and visitors have been crossing this stunningly beautiful harbor for centuries in simple ways like the Ferry. It is very quick, maybe 15 minutes to get to one side from the other. So, if it is a nice day, I encourage visitors to take a few minutes to ride the ferry and bask in the views of the harbor and the skyline, one of the best city views in the world."

Having previously seen the HK harbour from the Peak, I wanted a different perspective and Star Ferries was an easy solution. Having already purchased the nearly obligatory Octopus card (150HK$) for the week, the ferry hardly made a dent as each journey between HK Island and Kowloon is only 2HK$. The journey is short but you get a great view of the two harbour sides. If you want the top deck then you have to board the top deck from the harbour as you cannot change once you're on the ferry. Personally I prefer the lower deck as it is open and better for photographs whereas the top deck is windowed. On Kowloon side turn right and you have the old clock tower and the promenade leading to hand prints of movie stars and some statues such as Bruce Lee. You are also very close to the Museum of Art."

Trip to HK is not considered complete without taking Star Ferry! There are comments about taking tram (ding ding) is a must, I actually think it must be Star Ferry! Anyways, probably shouldn't make comparison between both as they are both important historical transportation in HK. It's unbelievable that the ferry looks exactly the same as the one featured in old HK movies!! Enjoyed it very much~ Disembarking at Tsim Sha Tsui pier leads you directly at doorstep of many attractions such as Avenue of Star, Light of Symphony,the clock tower, Space museum, Art museum, Science museum and even many many shopping centres!!!"

The concierge suggested that the water tours were expensive HK $80 per person and therefore suggested the Star Ferry crossing from Kowloon side to HK Island and all for HK $2.50 per person (one way).\nA simply stunning way to see the HK skyscrapers and no better way to do it.\nHighly recommended."

The ferries are nothing glamorous and the trip is short taking around 10-15 mins only. The new Central Pier (next to the ferris wheel) is also at an inconvenient location. Like most things in HK, its also not got good wheelchair or baby stroller access. tHowever it is a part of HK's history and the service dates back over a hundred years. And the actual ferries and the piers at TST and Wanchai still retain the feel of the good old days.Although I am a local HK resident and whenever I have time I still go on the ferry for no reason other than the ride itself. I consider it a part of the fast disappearing HK heritage, and also the best way to get so close to the harbour. How they are still running such regular schedules with half filled boats at HKD$2.50 ($3.40 on weekends) I do not know.Tips: If you are in HK on a clear day, go on the Star Ferry (day and night!). If you're in HK when the Christmas lights are up, most definitely go on the Star Ferry at night and take the TST to Wanchai service, you can't beat the view (the trip costs a little more but is also longer). Pay the little extra and go on the upper deck, its much quieter and even has air-conditioning in the summer (follow the signs to go up BEFORE you reach the ticket gates)."

The ferries are pretty old and beat up (they do get a LOT of wear), but pick a trip during the middle of the day when there are no crowds and you can get a good view with a breeze. Its only a 10-minute ride to or from Central, and you get to watch the crew in their blue sailor uniforms tie up and cast off with the old hemp rope, just like in the old days. The MTR might be more efficient and fast (and more costly), but cannot compare in providing that view!

It's cheap, it's easy and it's fun. This is like a budget harbour cruise! Take photos of the harbour as you take the short journey. There's a top deck and a bottom deck. If you want the top deck, you have to enter at the right level at the pier. No changing once you're on board! It's slightly more expensive on top, but the whole thing is so cheap that it shouldn't matter much to a traveller.Pay with the Octopus card (you should get one soon after you land) or buy a token to board.The journey from Kowloon ends at Central on Hong Kong Island. You can always take the MTR train back if the ferry made you sick! Yes, it does go up and down a bit, so be prepared for motion."

The whole experience is great, from the bustle of boarding up a ramp as the ferry bobs about in the harbour swell, to switching the back of the seat depending on which way you are going and want to face (the whole back swings through 90 degrees), to looking at the amazing views of both the Kowloon side and the Hong Kong island, and the other vessels ploughing up and down the harbour, (junks, sampans, other ferries, fireboats, barges, luxury cruise ships... I've seen them all), to watching the crew in their blue and white Ferryman uniforms tying up the ferry for disembarkation it is simply fantastic...

If you're travelling from the island to Kowloon, be ready to be accosted a bit on the other side by hawkers - you can get past them pretty fast though and on your way.There's another star ferry route from Wan Chai, and you can also get ferry rides across the harbour from North Point to Hung Hom and from Sai Wan Ho to Sam Ka Tsuen. http://www.hongkongextras.com/_other_ferries.html"

I get it as a means of transport between Hong Kong and Kowloon, but other than that, it was just o.k. The staff at the pier were rude/unhelpful--especially to tourists. We weren't sure about how/where to get a ticket, and the signage is pretty poor. We finally managed to get tickets and then asked a staff member about the best time to catch the ferry to see the light show at night. He was clearly displeased with this question, and started berating me --telling me \"You no wait--this is not tourist attraction--you go now. We don't want people hanging around here.\" Not even tourists, I guess. The boat ride itself was unremarkable. There are two decks: get a seat on the upper deck for a better view, but the way the windows are configured if you are not sitting directly next to one, it will be difficult to see much. The frames of the windows/walls pretty much obstruct much of any view unless you've got your head right in one. The ride from the Exhibition Center/Convention Center to Kowloon takes about 10 minutes or so. It's a straightforward ride across the harbor. Cost was 250 HKD per person, one way. As a quick, efficient way to get to the other side of the Harbour, I think it's great; other than that, I'm not sure why people recommend \"ride the ferry\" as a top attraction."

Considering how long the ferries have been in service it is amazing that \"things never change\". I have used the ferry since I was VERY young & a resident of HK and the views never fail to amaze me - a new cruise liner at Ocean Terminal, the tugs bringing goodies to the upper harbour, tourists on a junk ride and in the evening the light show. You really don't get the feel of Hong Kong if you don't even have one ride on the ferry. Often tourists don't even realise it goes to & from Wanchai as well, and that there are 2 classes of fares."

In fact, even tram lines were free that day.

From Kowloon there are 2 landing point options on the Island and the journey with return is spectacular both during the day and after sun down. There is also a Harbour cruise available at selected times. The entire Pier area is filled with atmosphere and activity irrespective of which direction you head. For newcomers I always suggest a trip to the Island followed by the Peak Tram and taking in the views from Victoria Peak and a visit to Bubba Gumps for a meal."

After watching the Symphony of Lights, we took the Star Ferry, which was just a few minutes' walk away, back to HK Island. It is both a cheaper and more scenic option. The journey seemed faster and more peaceful too. Words of caution though. Wait a while for the crowd to disperse, after the Symphony of Lights ends. About 30 minutes later, there were only a handful of passengers left. No hassle. From Wan Chai Ferry Pier, the walk on the long bridge to Wan Chai MTR is quite a distance.Otherwise, the ferry is indeed a scenic form of transport."

It not only provides a means of transport for the locals wishing to commute between these two places daily on a low fare but has in fact become a very popular must-do attraction for tourists to Hong Kong these days.For just a nominal fare you get to experience the ferry trip of a lifetime with a magnificent view of the beautiful skyline consisting of overcrowded rows of high-rise buildings and skyscrapers lining the entire waterfronts of Victoria Harbour on the Hong Kong Island side as well as the Kowloon side. It was truly an enjoyable ride with the sound of the waves and the wind brushing against your face. Unfortunately the ferry ride across the harbour takes only about ten minutes or so only\u2026.a bit too short I guess, but then considering the low fare, you may go on and have as many rides as possible until you are satisfied. Alternatively, there is a Star Ferry harbour cruise which takes you on a much longer circle around the whole harbour at a much higher fare. All you need to do is enquire for further information at the counter.There are many tourists who do the crossing every time they visit Hong Kong. It was the shortest, most enjoyable and unforgettable ferry ride."

The ferry is used by all sections of Hong Kong society and it is the most common means of moving from Kowloon to the Mainland. The tube is probably more efficient but travelling on, rather than under the harbour, is so much more interesting. The harbour is one of the busiest in the world and the view is always fascinating.

There is air conditioning compartment on upper deck in summer. Upper deck is quiter as engine room is on lower deck. On a rough wave or strong windy rainy day, better avoid standing/sitting near either front side of lower deck as water can splash onto deck. The Tai Cheong Bakery in Kowloon Star Ferry Pier is famous for its egg tart (local Chinese version of England's Bakewell pudding)."

The initial primary purpose of my taking of the Star Ferry was actually to travel from Central back to Tsim Tsa Tsui where my accommodation was, but I got more than what I expected. The wait for the ferries are almost nonexistent given the high frequency and large capacities of the ferries. Boarding and alighting was swift, and there was plenty of space on the upper deck where I sat. The Octopus Card can also be used instead of paying cash. It only cost HKD2.50 as I took it on a weekday. On weekends it costs HKD3.40 for a similar one-way adult ticket. The views were magnificent and unique as you can't get such views from anywhere else. I took the ferry at night and the lights and colors of the HK skyline were beautiful. The ride was pretty short (about 20 min) given how efficient everything is, and it just made me wish it was longer."

The Star Ferry Company began sailing in 1888 as the \u2018Kowloon Ferry Company\u2019. Nowadays it is one of the prime tourist attractions in Hong Kong, with over 26m people sailing across the Harbour each year. I found the experience to be very good value for money, but I wouldn't do it again if there was another way to get to Central.On the Kowloon side of the Harbour, you can often spend ages admiring the best skyline in Asia and often wonder why there is ever a need to cross to the other side, when presumably the view back to Kowloon is not quite as impressive. Well, this assumption may be true in a way, but remember over at Central there is the roof of Hong Kong - Victoria Peak! From there, you can look down over all of Hong Kong and her islands, and believe me the view is amazing, especially at sunset. There are road and rail tunnels that pass under the Harbour to get from Kowloon to Central, but the most traditional method of making the journey is certainly by sailing on the Star Ferry!The cost of an adult one-way fare across the Harbour from Kowloon to Central will set you back around $HK5.20, though there are discounts for children, the elderly, and the disabled. This is without question the cheapest way to get across the Harbour and as such is a very popular method of transportation with the locals.When I boarded the Star Ferry at Tsim Sha Tsui Pier, I was surprised to see that it was virtually empty. Maybe I just got lucky on this day. Anyway, I enjoyed the short and smooth ride across the Harbour and took in the sights, sounds, and smells. I changed my seats a few times to get better views.When I had arrived at Central Pier, I made my way to Victoria Peak \u2013 but not before I did a little shopping\u2026"

This sweet little ferry is a transportation powerhouse and friend to all Hong Kong commuters! The underground subway is more efficient in most cases but the views can't be beat! Enjoy the island side docks and visit the Maratime Museum too. On Kowloon side check out the Cultural Center. If your schedule allows be sure to get to the Kowloon side in the evening in time to get a spot on the viewing stand to see the phenomenal light show! Don't mix up the Wanchai ferry with the Central ferry. They both get you to the island side but their docks are. It near each other!"

It's short and sweet but let you take in the amazing skyline on both sides of the harbor. The old pier on the HK side had been replaced by the current pier which is just a short skip from the new Maritime Museum. When you get out of the ferry terminal, turn to your left for the museum and/or a nice walk by the water. The walk will take you all the way to the new HK government admin building and the green area around it. I was told that the walk will eventually link all the way to the HK Convention and Exhibition Center in Wanchai. You can either ride back to Kowloon on the ferry, or ride the subway at the Admiralty stop which is just beyond the big opening of the admin building."

            "review": "How to use the ferry. Look everyone is right, this is a must on your stay in HK, but when I use the ferry the most frequent question from tourists is how to buy tickets?There are three ways:1) Buy a tokenThese rather innocuous vending machines are about 15 metre from the automated gate entrance. You can only buy single tickets. Push button for number of passengers eg 1 adult and the prices comes up (the fare is slightly more expensive at weekends and if you take the upper deck \u2013 for the better views) put coins or notes into the machine and your change along with a plastic token come out of the bottom. Go to the automatic barrier marked tokens only drop the token in and walk through \u2013 simple! It\u2019s very cheap!2) Pay exact fareIf you have lots of change you can pay for the exact fare at the barrier marked Exact fare only \u2013 obviously. Remember its coins only, so have them ready before you get to the machine.3) Buy an Octopus CardThis is by far the best way all-round. HK has an excellent public transport system and an Octopus card allows you to travel on all of it. The MTR is effectively the Tube, or Subway its fast, frequent, clean and safe, although I have never travelled on it after midnight. Go to any service desk (manned counter) at any MTR station and ask for an octopus card. The minimum purchase is $HK 150 \u2013 about \u00a312. This includes a $HK50 refundable deposit you can get back at the end of your trip \u2013 just take it to a service desk and they will give you your money back. Once you have your card just walk up to the barrier marked with the card symbol and hold the card to the marked spot and the barrier will open \u2013 even simpler!You can check the remaining value on your Octopus by going to a machine marked Add Value Machine at any MTR station. Put your card in and it tells you how much you have left if you need to top it up simply put more money in!Now back to the FerryOnce through the barrier go to the waiting area which has two closed gates for either side of the jetty. Once the ferry has docked and people have got off there will be a buzzer and the barrier for the side of the jetty for the next ferry will open, you can walk down and get on-board. The upper deck has the better views, while the lower deck gives you a better view of the docking etc \u2013 if you like that sort of thing. There are two seating areas; a glassed area at each end which provides some protection from the elements \u2013 it\u2019s a short piece of water so unless in torrential rain I wouldn\u2019t bother, and an open area in the middle which as the better views. If the bench seat isn\u2019t facing the way you want, grab the top of the back and you can move it so you can sit whichever side you want \u2013 as long as no one is sitting there of course!Enjoy its great fun even after 100s of trips"

There are also some great spots to shoot some excellent photos from so you can remember and share you visit with friends and family on your return home. The Star Ferry is one of the most inexpensive modes of public transport on offer around Hong Kong and is well worth the around HK$2.50 for a one way trip on the upper deck. You will see views of both sides of Victoria Harbour that are not to be seen from anyother vantage spot. The journey on the lower deck is a little cheaper and also offers excellent views."

The ferries are very frequent, you rarely need to wait longer than 10 minutes and the 10 minute crossing is relaxing and stunning. The ferry can be very crowded at peek times (morning and evenings) but it is worth it. Why take the metro to cross when one can do it in style with the ferry?

One used to embark from, essentially, downtown, but now with reclamation on the Hong Kong side, it takes some deliberate footwork to get to the Central Pier. And with reclamation, the trip is far shorter. Another rather gloomy thing is that in the past the harbour was always filled with ships and boats. Naval vessels, barges, junks, water-taxis - the full spectrum of seacraft. Nowadays, the harbour is more like a small lake, with little traffic and nothing anchored. Granted, the view of Hong Kong island is fantastic in its way, but not in the way it was, the way that got the blood and eyes moving and the mind flooded with the \"Mysterious East\". Take the trip and enjoy it for what it is, but I suspect in another twenty years it will be gone for good."

I loved them so much so I tried to fit as many crossings as possible into my schedule."

The cheapest way to do this is to purchase a simple crossing ticket for about 50 cents that takes you wither to Kowloon or Hong Kong. (The Kowloon Hong Kong route give a better view) Or You can purchase for a little more, the hour long harbour tour that takes in all the coastline and offers you some of the best picture opportunities going. Prices for the tour are around $200HK each and departs funnily enough on the hour, every hour from any of the various stops along the route. Included in the price is a drinks voucher that you can redeem on board for a hot or cold drink, this also includes free nibbles in the form of cookies or crisps depending on your preference. A continuous commentary via recorded audio is playing that tells you facts and interesting stories about some of the landmarks that you pass by. Highlights and plus points:Great value for moneyComfortable Good commentary trackDrinks voucher a plus Helpful staff Can get on at any of the various piersNegative points:The commentary is a little behind where you actually are.If a bit rough the experience can be off putting. Its relaxing and actually a great way to either start or end your time in Hong Kong. The food is good and setting is exceptional. If you don't have a trip on the Star Ferry whilst in Hong Kong then you have missed out!"

Buy a ticket from the dispenser ( go to the central side the upper deck) you can use HK bills or coins no problem. Once you have your token you will walk about 20 meters and put you token in the slot. Walk straight and look up for the sign that is lit up to indicate which side the ferry will come on. It's about 10 min total. Get off go down the stairs and walk left to bus stop 15c not the big bus one the last one. Take this to the tram terminus. There is a great park across the street to walk around and just enjoy a beautiful park and for sure go to the Aviary and enjoy the birds all free. With the ferry bus and park you will have spent about 16 Hong Kong dollars for a 3 hour tour. Take the 15c back to the pier and reverse you trip. Great budget tour!"

The automized English speaking guide aboard the ferry was, unlike many other similar recordings, very clear and informative. From time to time the waves made the trip quite shaky, so you might wanna take this into account if you easily get seasick. While waiting for the boat I enjoyed the view over Hong Kong from the pedestrian plateau right next to the harbour. I also had time to take a picture of the Watch Tower from there."

We also visited Victoria Peak and rode the Peak tram. The views from the Observation Deck are spectacular and we were lucky as it was a fairly clear day. Had a nice lunch there also. From Kowloon we caught a bus to Aberdeen and walked along the harbour it is lovely there. We seen all the floating markets, the Junk boats and different cultures.

Nothing to do with the fact that it's \"cheap as chips\" the experience is really worth it. Whether by day or night the experience shouldn't be missed. Over the years I have taken many photos but this one was taken November 2013. I do recommend however that you opt for the top deck each time you travel on the Ferry.It's a very short trip, with all the reclamation of land over the years, the trip has become even shorter. Fares are easy just at the terminal, there are vending machines which give you a disk which you then use to admit you through to the waiting area. Ferries are very frequent so you shall never be left waiting a lengthy period.If you are taking the Star Ferry from Central to Kowloon you can pop into the Ocean Terminal which is on your left as you disembark the Terminal. There is quite a lot do see just around that area. Should you walk to your right from the terminal you can stroll along the viewing platform where you can take some lovely photos. The light show is shown each evening I believe around 8pm (free). It's a bit ho hum but worth it if it's your first visit to Hong Kong. The Harbour view is truly spectacular especially in the evening.Hong Kong is very exciting; it's so diverse in what it has to offer. I don't think I'll ever become tired of visiting Hong Kong."

Came back on the lower deck which is quite a bit cheaper, but I felt gave you a better feel for the ship. You are closer to the water - can look in on the engine room - which had a shiny nice new diesel installed.The doors are left open - I think to assist cooling. On this deck you can walk right forward to stand along side the skippers cabin where the anchor lie near the bows. Its all an atmospheric setting oozing history out of its pores. Tried to find a ships plate stating when & where the ferry was built but to no avail - and I could find nobody who could tell me. Wikipaedia informs that the original Star ferries were built 1871 in England - but the current ferries in service hail form the Hong Kong & Whampoa dockyards - the oldest dating from 1956."

Often days are hazy so the views are not clear. Using the Star ferry gives a different perspective on this view as the island becomes closer.When travelling from Tsim Sha Sui there are two boats that can be taken, to Central or Wanchai, it is a 10 minute trip and the cost is HK$2.5 making it surely the best value boat trip. You can use the octopus card.Even if you don't need to cross the harbour, I recommend that you do it, if you want to come stralght back you just walk off the ferry and loop round to get on again. A round trip would take maximum 40 minutes. The journey is quite different at day and night, the lights at night are spectacular.These boats are a little haven of tradition and history in a very modern city, I've travelled several times and every time I'm in awe of the wonderful views."

The Star Ferry has always been and will probably always be one of the greatest travel bargains on earth. I adore the Star Ferry."

I hadn't ridden the Star Ferry for over 10 years as every time I visit HK, the piers seem to get further and further away from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong and Kowloon side! But with time on my hands, made the effort to locate the Star Ferry pier on Central.Ten years ago, it was a brisk 7-8 minute walk from the front lobby of the Mandarin Oriental hotel. This time I was dismayed to discover it entailed nearly double the time. Gone is the charming pier with rickshaws parked in front, the stalls selling hot snacks and mango ice cream past the turnstile. Instead it's been replaced by a much larger 2 storey pier with standard tourist shops and travel agent. At least no more confusion if you need the ferry to Kowloon or Hung Hom! Still the ferries themselves and the gang plank, angle depending on the tide level, remain unchanged. BIG TIP for newbies :- the seat backs need to be flipped so that you're facing in the direction of travel. Intriguing ride as you see the variety of vessels and remember that Victoria harbour remains a true working thoroughfare."

The views are extraordinary and the whole experience is fun and feels very much like an \"only in Hong Kong\" thing. We rode back and forth between Central and Tsim Sha Tsui 3 or 4 times and it was enjoyable each time because every time we spotted something different. Upgrade to first class on the top deck (it costs practically nothing) and get a seat by the sides for the best views. I also recommend riding the first time during the daytime and then riding again later at night. Absolutely beautiful in both directions and a nice change of pace from riding the MTR back and forth under the harbor."

Nothing beats a boat ride from one side of Hong Kong to the other or makes you feel more at home in this beautiful city. The views at night are just spectacular. It's got to be one of the cheapest attractions going, at only a couple dollars round trip. If you use an octopus card you almost feel like its free! Be sure to move the seat back of the bench to the direction you would like to sit so you have the best view possible if you snag the row first! I always head for the spot on the bench closes to the side for an unobstructed view. Once you arrive at port, take your time disembarking, it takes a few minutes to moor and you can soak up the atmosphere and save your energy for the pounding your feet will take as you explore this wonderful city!"

When you are in Hong Kong, you simply have to do it once.i would make a recommendation though, if you are planning to do the Star Ferry, go from Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon to the Hong Kong island. In this way, you can see the Hong kong harbour view. You may even enjoy more if you do a bit of homework first. In YouTube, search for \"Nacny Kwan Susie Wong\", the movie \"The World of Susie Wong\" should pop up. Click on it and see the beginning of the movie, the first 6 minutes. You will see William Holden walking right into the Star Ferry building on the Kowloon side---the sequence starts at 01:15; see how it was, and how it is; truly nothing has been changed except that there are less passengers nowadays. Interestingly, at 06:10, you can see the Hong Kong harbour view from the Star Ferry. See how Hong Kong has changed in the past 50 years. it is really cool if you can see the beginning of the movie first, and then take the ferry ride.Hope you enjoy this."

Views from both are great. There's no aircon but most of the year thats ok. Board early to get a window seat. I've taken this ferry over the last 20 years and I'm still amazed about the ever changing skyline in this great city.Be sure to buy an Octopus card for your easy travel by MTR, bus, ferry etc. You can also use it to pay at supermarkets etc. No need to carry too much cash."

I was born in Hong Kong, then lived in Australia from the age of 11 for many years, upon returning to HK, one of few landmark icons which have not changed over the years was the Central Star Ferry Pier on HK island, until a few years ago.The sad news is the government, in the name of progress and development, have dismantled the original star ferry pier on the Central side. Massive protests did absolutely nothing to change these pen pushers' minds and the destruction went ahead despite all the voices against the move. The new Star Ferry Pier on Central side is like a 'disney' version of the original, a little fake, a little far (from the original spot and it's a bit of a hike over the footbridge, so don't carry too much when heading to the Central pier), and a little disappointing for those who have seen the original. However, the good news, is that at least the ferry company did not pack up the old ferries and gone for something modern and luxurious, in fact, lets hope they have engineers in the years to come who can continue to maintain these wonders on the harbour, as they're an absolute joy to be riding on. It's a slow ferry (although it used to take longer - now, it's just simply because the harbour's width is getting narrower, so a 'faster' ride....), but it gives you time to admire the harbour front of HK, allows you time to take a moment to think, reflect on the day you've had, or plan the day you're about to have. It's magical that ferries like this still exist and it's something to be experienced when you arrive in HK. In fact, get on, walk about when you get to the other side, and get back on again, and again, and again. It's cheap as chips and guarantee to be the most economical tourist ride you'll ever be on, and enjoy. Ok, apart from the HK tram perhaps, but that's another story.Last words, don't just try the ferry ride between Central and TST (on the Kowloon side of HK, over Vic Harbour), because you can also take the ferry from TST to WanChai, then from WanChai to Hunghom also. I'll leave the rest of the exploring to you. Enjoy Hong Kong!"

For HK$2 (or $2.50 for upper class) you get to ride across the harbour on a piece of history. It runs with Chinese efficiency and has some lovely touches such as the bench seats where the backs are moveable so you always sit facing the direction of travel. Just hope on board, relax and take in the scenery"

One has to travel on the Star Ferry, from Kowloon to Central, to experince life before there were tunnel, or MTR's and now bridges to transport one from Hong Kong Island toKowloon and now Lantau as well. Travelling on the Star ferry will give you the taste of Victoria Habour and all that it has to offer. Inaddition, you can test yourself on the skyline to name the buildings and see how many you get correct. Do it and not just think about it."

Traveling with the locals and people from all over the world across one of the most famous harbors in the world is Magnificent unforgettable experience ! The skylines from both sides of the harbor are amazing. Go at different times. For example, early morning, dusk, and at night ( the lighted skylines, unique to HK ) . Take some time to linger, browse,shop, before you board on either side to savor the flavor of the Orient and let it sink in. When crossing, you never know what you will see. A huge Cruise ship coming in at a distance , small oriental craft, or large sea going vessels . Share your stories with the various tourists from all over the world . Don't forget your camera.

It is even better if you are a senior as there is no charge at all. Hong Kong is very caring of its seniors and extends that courtesy also to foreign visitors. It is almost a tradition in Hong Kong and I have been visiting regularly for about 50 years and the Star Ferry remains the one constant in this magnificent city. There are all the high speed ferries plying around the harbour back and forward to various islands and destinations close by (Discovery Bay, Lamma Island, Macau etc.) but this one retains the colour and authenticity of old Hong Kong. It bobs up and down. chugs a bit but the kids love it and it still has a bit of the slow paced world that seems to be left behind in Hong Kong. The 5 stars is more for the experience rather than the attraction itself and the 2 of you can cross this magnificent harbour for less than A$1 (free if your old enough!!!!!)."

Don't get me wrong, it was nice to just lean back and do nothing for an hour but nothing I would do again.Included in the price were some dry \"Black tea cookies\" and a coke and those cookies were plain nasty *lol* Another thing that made me a bit annoyed was the fact that you got your ticket and had to go up some stairs to wait, then they came and got us all, and took us down the same stairs again, walk across the entire complex and up another set of stairs again. Not a problem for me, but there were some older couples and parents with prams that couldn't really keep up and had problems with the stairs. Why not just take us to the right designated area in the first place?Besides that, it was a nice sunny afternoon :)"

The vessels run back and forth without turning around, so the backs of the seats flip over to accommodate both directions of travel. Sure, the seats are hard and the waters of Victoria Harbor can be a little rough at times (standing while under way is not allowed), but it is fun and offers great views of the city from the water.Be aware that the prices on the weekend jump all the way to HK3.40, or 43 cents US."

The ferry is a part of the local transportation system in Hong Kong and a more pleasant way to cross the water than by the underground although it takes more time.The cost is minimal (slightly less for the lower deck). There are more stairs for both getting to the upper deck and leaving the terminals from that level. Lower deck has quicker but there is a hint of diesel fuel as the ferry makes its way. It is fun, though, to watch the sailors from that level as they secure the thick ropes holding the boat in position. They quickly coil the line as the ferry leaves the dock and reach with a grappling hook to catch the rope when the ferry arrives.The upper deck provides some indoor seating areas. On both levels the back of the seats is adjustable in order to be facing forward regardless of which direction of travel.Whether you sit in the Upper or Lower decks, the experience is an integral part of Hong Kong."

We were here on March 20 to 25 in 2013 (I was here also in 1972)MUST GO!!!You do not have to use the Star Ferry to get across to Hongkong Island. You can take the metro (=subway) Don't - Use the Star Ferry!Otherwise you will miss out on one of the most historic and individual, easy to access and travel experiences.How to get there:Just ask for Star Ferry- Everyone knows how to get thereWhat to expect:A rather short boat trip with a very individual view from the water onto Hongkong and KowloonCosts:3 HKD (=EUR 0,30) You can not travel any cheaper than that anywhere in the world I guess.Comfort:Overroofed. First level is also windprotected. Try to go on the top once and at the bottom once.Must Do:Book a harbour tour with the Star Ferry (=110 HKD = EUr 11,- per person) takes about 1,5 houres.. Bring food and drinks.Must do with kids:Be at the front on the top and see the water swirrl when the ferry \"hits the brakes\". See photo.Small children will love it. Ours did (and I did too when I was small some 40 years ago!)Did you know that:A ferry does have a front and a back. Although the Star Ferry seem to look the same back to front, you can recognize the front at the white pole. The back pole is green.Not so good idea:We thought it a good idea to look at the Lazershow (every night at 20h00) from the ferry, to get the best view from both sides. No good, for you miss out on the music which makes a big difference to the show.We will be on the Star Ferry again, when we visit Hongkong."

Simply buy the token (if you don't have exact change there are machines to buy tokens which give change) and wait for the next ferry. Maximum waiting time for me was about 5 minutes. There is no faffing with leaving and arriving the piers and the doors open to let you on/off within a couple of minutes of reaching the piers.

There is also the Hong Kong Tourism Board where you can find out where else to visit, and a newsstand.

For how cheap it costs, it really has to be on your list of things to do when visiting Hong Kong. Whether riding in the day or at night, the views are guaranteed to be as spectacular. The last time I went on it was at night a couple of days before Christmas, when lots of the buildings on Hong Kong Island were covered in neon Christmas messages, it was fantastic. You don't have to wait long for a ferry at all and they run until about 11pm at night so they are really accessible. They are plenty of seats onboard but I like to stand up and get the breeze as we're crossing, it's such a magnificent and surreal experience, overall it takes about 10 minutes to cross the water depending on which pier you travel from.My review title must sounds quite dramatic but it's completely true. Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbour is so incredible that taking the views in via the Star Ferry does make it one of the best things in the world to do particularly as it's so so cheap as well. Lots of facilities at the ferry terminals too: toilets, food and drink outlets. If you were pushed whether to do it in the day or at night I'd definitely go for at night, all the lights make quite a spectacle."

The old pier was adjacent to the Post Office and to City Hall, which were both on the waterfront, so more convenient than the new pier which is out on the reclamation. Minibuses stopped right in front of the pier and the bookshop provided a good place to meet up with a friend. This was before the days of mobile phones!Compared to the new pier it was a bit scruffy but adequate. The new pier is quite magnificent. Built in the old style it boasts restaurants, shops and cafes.Although the Harbour has shrunk considerabley over the years, the Star Ferry ride is should still be near the top of the list for visitors.

The 5 or 10 minutes acros the harbour on a nice day is a great experience.And for once, you can save money and get a better experience! Use the lower deck entrance, and you can look down into the immaculate engine-room, watch the crew use the ropes, and watch the skipper pilot the ferry safely across the channel. Great!And although the ferries are all locally made, the polished brass and wood wheels in the wheel-houses have \"Greenock, Scotland\" cast into them - an added bonus for any Scotsman crossing the harbour.Finally, the new ferry pier at Central may be a modern interpretation of the originals, but still offers the look and feel of the old ones, but with better catering, toilets and other functions."

I recommend you taking this if you have time to spare, or if you have to, do spare time to experience this! for just HKD$2 you get to enjoy and be part of the heritage of HK. The anti-falungong banners and signage on the Kowloon star Ferry pier were also an interesting sight to see. The ride takes all but just 10 minutes and the frequency is pretty good too. Just be sure to choose your deck correctly as once you choose the lower deck you can't go up and vice versa. i would recommend the upper deck asbit is usually less crowded and offer nicer seats with less gasoline odours :) Together with the Ding Ding Tram on HK island and peak tram, this is a must do after a nice stroll on the Avenue of Stars."

The City Sightseeing Tour rep advised us to go on the upper deck, as the view is much better. Also, the engine fumes and noise are less noticeable. (Note that the price of the ticket for the upper deck is slightly higher). My Scottish- born husband enjoyed the experience even more than I did because it reminded him of growing up / using ferries in his childhood in Scotland."

Unfortunately though, the old Central to Hung Hom route is no more (sadly, the end of an era, in my opinion) so if you're staying in the Hung Hom area, you'll need to find alternative travel arrangements."

The famous Star Ferry has been a fixture in Hong Kong since the early 1900's, it once was the connection between the island and the Mainland until the MTR tunneled under the harbour. I suggest that you do one trip on the top and one on the bottom, these have to be pre planned at the terminal as you can't go up or down once you board. These 5-10 minute boat rides give you amazing views of both HK and TST as you roll side to side over the waves. The lower side give a different perspective as you can smell the Diesel engine room which reminds me of railway ties or creosote power poles. The smell is not over powering at all, combined with the ocean breeze you can close your eyes and remember the old days."

The ride takes about 5 to 7 minutes and has a price of $2HKD which is .30 cents U.S. This is the best deal for a world famous attraction (outside of free) in the entire world.Keep in mind if the waves are choppy, entry and exit out of the ferry can be a little challenging. This is not something you want to do in high heels or any shoes that are already a challenge to walk in. Ride this ferry day or night, either way, the views are jaw-dropping. It is one of the most enjoyable experiences in Hong Kong. Personally, I could easily move to Hong Kong just to ride the ferry on a daily basis."

From the ferry, you have an excellent view over the Hong Kong skyline, and a ticket cost hardly more than crossing underground via MTR. The ferries have two decks: the upper deck offers a better view, but on the lower deck you see better what is involved in handling and mooring the ferry.Upper deck tickets are slightly more expensive, and weekend tickets are more expensive than week tickets."

My mom, sister and I just finished the Symphony of lights at the Avenue of Stars and waited for the crowd to die down before taking the bus 1A. We walked up to the line but there was a group of like 30 people that wanted to wait for everyone before getting on blocking the line. Since there were only 3 of us, one of the tour guide toward the back of the line waved at us to go ahead so we walked past the whole group of people but along the way we were blocked by a few so we had just missed the bus and the door was closed by the time we got up to the front. Then the tour guide in the front started to have a fit and started yelling at us that we were cutting in line. Of course they then were speaking in there own language and making bad remarks toward us. I then tried to flag the tour guide in the back of the group and he had the nerve to pretend that he never told us to go up. He started calling me crazy in English and said somehting else but I was never rude to him at all. I just told him to ask his own coworker what he had told us to do and be reasonable and not to lie. They just kept talking back and forth to each other in their own language. That was when the next bus pulled up. I refused to get back to the end of the line because seriously there were only 3 of us and we were already there in the front. I made sure those people did not push us around because if anything happened I would have called the cops. I told them I have never been to the police station and I had all night to do what is necessary. So we got on the bottom section and each of them got in to the bus and stared at us. It's ok. I was not intimidated at all. But you know, I have no idea what they were arguing about because the whole tour wanted to sit on the top level of the bus. The 3 of us had the whole bottom level to ourselves. So, my advice to everyone is PLEASE STAY AWAY from all tour groups! Also, if you are on a tour please get our own tour buses to ship you around. Do not block public transportation at your own expense, other people are entitle to use it!"

It is very cheap, with the lower deck being cheaper than the upper deck. On hot days, the front cabin of the upper deck has air conditioner.I go to Hong Kong every now and then and I always use the ferry to cross the harbour so I have a card (Octopus card) to use on the transports and some supermarkets like 7/11, but if you don\u2019t buy one you need to have change to buy the ticket in the machine.

It is stable, quick and comfortable. A must try is the Egg Tarts available at the Star Ferry Pier on the Tsim Sha Tsui side. They have 2 branches, one shop right at the entrance of the pier but before the gate and another shop after you got inside the gate. The egg tarts are kept hot and yummy, only HKD8 each. Their chicken pie is also great. Between the 2 shops, I found the tarts at the branch before entering the gate is fresher and hotter. So don't forget to buy these special Hong Kong pastries when you visit Hong Kong!"

Even though there are multiple options concerning the crossing of the Harbour i.e. MTR underground and cross-harbour tunnels, the Star Ferry and its piers is a throwback in time and still a bargain at $2.50 HKD or about $0.35 one-way.Tokens: Be sure to have change to get a token which unfortunately is a cheap plastic disk, not historic yet does its function. Most riders use their Octopus card for access. If leaving Kowloon, you have a choice between Central and Wan Chai. The Central dock is energetic with a bus station and many shops leading to Canton Road. If looking for upscale shopping on HK Island, the Central stop would be the choice. Also the Central stop is the closet to the Island line of the MTR.The other stop option is Wan Chai where the Convention Center is located. In general a less active option as there is a bus station upon arrival, however a solid 10-15 minute walk to the MTR station an Wan Chai. Best of staying or conducting business in Wan Chai.Views: While all the views heading south from Kowloon to HK Island are impressive, Central would be the better of the two as you have a view of not only of Central but also the mid-levels and Victoria Peak. The ride at dusk is truly breathtaking and be sure to have your camera ready.The ride takes 8 minutes of less. Used to be longer, however with infill on both sides of the Harbour, the ride seems to shorten every few years. If looking for a historic and relaxed option for travel between Kowloon and HK, this is the best option. "

Once docked the skipper moves to the wheelhouse to steer in the next direction as these ships have dual controls. When I first saw these ferries it struck me as odd but I am now convinced that the system is brilliant. Also the backs of the bench seats can be moved so the passengers can see the views ahead of them. Sometimes, though, people do not move the seat backs so you see a mixed group of people viewing where they are going and some seeing where they have been. If you are over 65 and have bought an Octopus card that can be used pretty much everywhere just swipe it and go through the turnstile. The fare will be ZERO Hong Kong dollars. This is the city's way of thanking its senior citizens for living that long. :) BTW previously there used to be separate lane for senior citizens but this year they cancelled that and ask that you use your Senior Octopus card. You can use the Star ferry system to get to your destination or just hop from one to another and have a great sightseeing tour of the city and Victoria Harbor."

My family and I took this ferry from Kowloon to Hong Kong island in the morning and we experieced the morning hour rush.The trip ware not that long, about 15-20 minutes or so, but we certainly enjoy the sea breeze and the wave splashing against the ferry. Of course who can ignore the smell of dissel coming from the engine room.The ferry waas not crowded and there are enough seats for every one. On the way, it is possible to also enjoy the scenic view of both Hong Kong and Kowloon covered by a layer of fog.It is definitely a good experience and a must when you come to Hong Kong. This may be one of the few places left where you can still find the ferries of the old time."

Tired of being crammed in the MTR and having to switch trains at Admiralty during rush-hour? Take the Star Ferry! For only $2.5HKD you get a relaxing 15 minutes journey from Wan Chai to Kowloon. Go around the time of the \"Symphony of Lights\" and the Ferry will pause in the middle of the harbour to ensure that passengers get a view. Plus, even when the ferry is \"crowded\" you won't have people invading your personal space like on the MTR. Did I mention the same journey on the MTR costs about $10.50HKD/person?Even if you're just in HK for the day, take some time to ride the Star Ferry. Chances are you're going to want to explore the Kowloon side as well as HK Island anyway.TIP:If you're travelling from HK Island on the Star Ferry around the time of the Symphony of Lights, turn right out of the ferry terminal in TST and head towards the Avenue of Stars. This provides the best vantage point for light show and also broadcasts the accompanying music and script (in English M/W/F) that enhances the show."

I took the Airport Express to the Hong Kong station and went directly there to the ferry termimal (less than a 5 minutes walk). The kiosk for a token was easy to use, and I was on a ferry within minutes. Although there is an hour long tour option, I just went across the harbor, stayed on while everyone else departed, and came back for a 20 minutes round trip. Great views of the skyline, and the best part is that it only cost about 32 cents US ($2.50 HK)!!"

As I prefer to take MTR, the last time I took the ferry was a year ago with my expat friend before his transfer to the UK.Believe me, you won't regret it even though one may find it nothing special -- for those who like taking ferries, I strongly recommend taking ferries to Lamma (Yung Shue Wan) for seafood dinner / hiking / just to see the place or Mui Wo or Discovery Bay. Ferries for these outlying island are at the pier near Central MTR station / 10 mins walk from the Star Ferry Central pier."

When I asked about things to do & see on my recent visit, he quickly stated, \"Ride the Star Ferry across the Harbor, and visit the Peak.\" I'm so glad that we did both! The ferry is cheap way to see the harbor ( think the Staten Island Ferry in NYC). We also took a city double decker bus from the Ferry terminal to the top of the Peak and back (requires two fares), and a double decker city trolley around the lower city, again a cheap way to see the city.I highly recommend you do all of the above, but also, if time permits, take the tram to the top of the Peak during daylight, have dinner at the top, and return by tram after dark."

But what does make it different from any other ferry is the sensational view of Hong Kong's miriads of amazingly designed buildings.Note that the ferry doesn't berth fully but the sailors just hold the ropes so it nudges the quay for people to hop on. Also, that on the HK side there are a few touts. And that on hte Kowloon side there is a long taxi rank. Definitely worth a trip for the amazing views."

Star Ferry has a really interesting history including being used to evacuate expats prior to Japanese occupation. Don't miss a trip across the harbour on Star Ferry!"

Apart from riding the iconic Star Ferry, the Star Ferry Pier area itself is a curious amalgam - home to a great deal of history on the one hand, and a showpiece of contemporary Hong Kong on the other. I would recommend its best to explore the Pier area on foot. Some key sights to take in (also great photo opps!):1. Start walking from near 'The Pen' - the blue blooded Peninsula Hotel, once rated by connoisseurs as 'the finest hotel east of Suez', and still living up to that title by all accounts. Opened in 1928, the Peninsula combines colonial & modern elements, and apart from its luxurious rooms and restaurants, is also noted for its large Rolls-Royce fleet. Fourteen of them in signature 'Peninsula Green'. Hang around and take some good snaps of the hotel, the Rolls-Royces - you can't beat history when it comes to good snaps.2. A little further down from The Peninsula is Heritage 1881 - the headquarters of the Hong Kong Marine Police for over a century, until about 15 years ago. Built in 1884 and now officially christened as 1881 Heritage, it is a very stately, handsome building with a striking Victorian facade in line with its rich colonial past. Today, apart from offering up some part of Hong Kong's history, its shopping arcade is home to an impressive range of luxury brands.3. Across the road is the Hong Kong Space Museum for astronomy and space science in Tsim Sha Tsui - the planetarium's dome covers a huge 8,000 square meters, making it a very recognizable Hong Kong landmark.4. Right next to the Space museum on Salisbury Road is the Hong Kong Cultural Centre - a multipurpose performance facility, most easily recognized by an intriguing installation of mirror 'pillars' that throw out myriad reflections. The Concert Hall here is home to the Hong Kong Philharmonic. The Grand Theatre with almost 2000 seats is part of this complex - it stages musicals, ballets and operas.5. Adjacent to the Hong Kong Cultural Centre is the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower virtually at the end of Salisbury Road facing Victoria Harbour. Earlier known as the Kowloon-Canton Railway Clock Tower, it is built of red bricks and granite. We are told that the clocks on this tower began ticking in 1921, and have kept going since, except during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong during World War II.6. And now you are at Star Ferry Pier itself - a place where history was made when in 1880 Dorabjee Naorojee Mithaiwala began his ferry service across Victoria Harbour with his first steamboat, the Morning Star...While taking in the view, please do sample the fare from the bakeries at the pier (they are on the left when you face the pier terminal) - they offer a most delectable selection of goodies - tarts, cakes, puffs - divine is an understatement!7. Adjacent to the Pier is Harbour City on Canton Road offering a large variety of fashionable, trendy brands. In fact, flagship stores of virtually all leading upmarket international brands are concentrated on Canton Road - living testimony to the Hong Kong people's love for the big luxe brands.Walking through the the Star Ferry Pier area is veritably a walk through historical and contemporary Hong Kong."

The ride itself is short (5-6 minutes), cost is inexpensive and the views phenomenal. On the Kowloon side, the pier area itself is somewhat dingy, however, there are two high end malls a few steps away. We chose the upper deck for the trip to Hong Kong Island and the lower deck for the trip back. Either one gives you the views. Usually there are more people on the lower deck (it's cheaper), but neither time was it crowded. If you are planning to use the MTR, Star Ferry, and other means of public transportation, buy an Octopus card which you swipe and the fare is deducted. This saves you needing to have exact change each time you travel."

We went just before dusk and the nightly light show (which is amazingly fun). So, we saved the higher fare and yet were right on the promenade in the harbor for the show. The one-hour tour of the harbor is very interesting, and you get a beverage and snack (pound cake, for us) as part of the entry price. We truly enjoyed the pier and the ferry tour."

You can buy your tokens from a machine right by the boat. Victoria Harbor is surrounded by great views, so it's a treat to be in the middle of it. I agree with the reviewer who says you haven't seen Hong Kong if you haven't taken the ferry. That is because Kowloon is the part of Hong Kong that visitors dream of. That is where you find the busy streets, shopping, and bright lights that you see in movies (similar to Times Square). I recommend taking the ferry so you are in Kowloon after the sun sets. The view of downtown, with brightly light office buildings, is magical."

The ferries link Hong Kong Island and Kowloon and are a pleasant way to make the harbor crossing. The ferry ride was voted in 1999 as one of the \u201c50 Places of a Lifetime\u201d by the \u201cNational Geographic Traveller\u201d Magazine and was voted Number 1 in the \u201cTop 10 Most Exciting Ferry Rides\u201d poll by the Society of American Travel Writers in 2009.This ferry ride provides the traveller with one of the cheapest sightseeing trips in Hong Kong. At the same time the traveller can gain an insight into the lifestyle of the people of Hong Kong. The ride is a delight at all times of day but is probably best at dusk or during the night when you are treated to breathtaking views of the iconic skyline of Hong Kong. The buildings along the shoreline compete with one another to provide an interesting light show at night. Do not forget to take your camera with you since you will be given numerous opportunities for great pictures of what must be one of the most interesting skylines in the world.The Star Ferry Company can trace its history back to 1880 when Dorabjee Naorojee Mithaiwala, a Parsee cook, started a new business providing ferry service across Victoria Harbor with his steamboat, the Morning Star. Sir Catchick Paul Chater purchased all the boats and in May 1898, the Star Ferry Company became a public company. Its name is derived from the fact that all the ferries bore the name \u201cStar\u201d"

On the Kowloon side, the Star Ferry Pier is close to the Peninsula Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui, and you can pay for the crossing with your Octopus Card (designed and implemented here first, then exported to London as the Oyster Card). The crossing only takes about 8-10 minutes but it really is one of the big attractions of Hong Kong, especially in the evening with the lights shimmering on the water, and is said to be the finest ferry crossing in Asia.

I've lived in Hong Kong for many years and so I miss the old Star Ferry pier, which was dirty and unkempt, but much more \"Hong Kong\". The new confection, with its new clock tower just seems a bit fake. However, they have some nice little shops and the cake shop sells lovely, warm egg tarts \u2013 just the ticket while waiting for the ferry.Of course the ferry itself remains the best value ride in the territory \u2013 where else could you experience the wonderful harbour views for less than the price of a newspaper? And it is such a peaceful way to travel between Hong Kong Island and the rest of Hong Kong.Highly recommended!"

The new Central Star Ferry Pier is such a long walk from Central, especially if you are not very able-bodied, as we noticed with our father having real trouble with the distance this visit. Where once, due not only its appeal (and price) but also to its location, you would use the Star Ferry as a legitate means of getting across the harbour whilst going about your everyday business, now unfortunately it seems to have been solely relogated to a tourist attaction that needs a special effort to reach.

This is easily one of the best HK$2.50 (US$0.32) per adult, HK$1.50 (US$0.19) per child that you will ever spend. Where else can you cross one of the world's finest harbors, admiring one of the world's finest skylines for the price of loose pocket change? Another option, that many don't seem to know about, is the evening harbor cruise and the hop-on/hop-off afternoon services available with Star Ferry. The boats allocated for these services leave every hour from the three major piers; including Wan Chai (HK Island) and make a slow circular route around Victoria Harbor, allowing much more time on the water to admire the wonderful harbor and skyline. Costs for this service vary between HK$90-190 based on which service you book. You can sort this out at the harbor cruise ticket booths at each of the three ferry piers. We love the historical and iconic Star Ferry. The fact that it still serves such an important purpose to local commuters and is so easily accessible to visitors wishing to experience a bit of the world famous Hong Kong Start Ferry, makes this a real source of pride for Hong Kong.The Star Ferry is a 'no-brainer' inclusion for visitors considering what to do/see when visiting Hong Kong. Even as locals, we love this attraction and visit it often."

This is a sad, sad thought.My absolute favorite way to get around in HK is Star Ferry. Usually I prefer the upper deck for the better views. But the lower deck gives you more of the sounds and smells that make the Ferry go back and back, back and forth, all day long.The Tsim Sha Tsui side still gives you the original Star Ferry feeling - the older pier with its rusting metal painting over and over again with that green, green paint.The Central side is more modern, and hints of the ferry's demise.Best enjoyed at night.I hope Star Ferry is still putting through the Harbor the next time we are in Hong Kong!"

The price is almost non-existent (actually, it's free for the over 65s). Use an Octopus card or buy a Star Ferry token from the vending machines to travel. Timetable and prices here: http://www.starferry.com.hk/services.htmlCatch it from Tsim Sha Tsui (Kowloon side) to Central or Wan Chai (both on the HK Island side), or vice versa. It really is a case of \"sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride\". It's fun to people-watch. It's fun to watch the other boats on the harbour, and it's fun to see the work going on around the harbour. The views are wonderful, and you feel like you're part of history -- which you are, as the Star ferries have been working HK Harbour for over 100 years. A ride on the Star Ferry is something that every visitor to HK should enjoy!"

Some improvements are present though, such as using the multi-purpose Octopus card to pay for entry instead of fumbling for coins, better benches and good flooring. The ferry terminal at the TST side remains unchanged, but the one at Central has been replaced by a modern building."

Tickets go on sale 30 mins before the next departure time. The pier itself was very old, a little run down, and for the life of me, I did not understand why they gathered us at one end of the pier, on the second floor, only to take us down to ground level and back up again. If you have elderly folks or kids in strollers, you might want to ask about that.Anyways, the cruise was quite relaxing, it wasn't crowded, nice way to spend an hour :) you could get a pass that lets you hop on and off the cruise.We took a 4 pm cruise, the 7 pm cruise includes a view of the lightshow at Avenue of The Stars and refreshments.Don't buy the hot chocolate on the boat..it was gross. On another day, we ended up on the passenger ferry after our cab driver ditched us at the pier at Central (?). That was also a nice experience as we've never had the opportunity to commute on a ferry before :) great view of the Xmas lights in the city."

There were plenty of seats during non-rush hour although I spent the entire journey standing at the side of the ferry for photography purposes.

We were recently in Hong Kong for the first time and one of the things I wanted to do was to ride the Star ferry between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. For some reason this stood out in my mind as an iconic trip.Well it exceeded my expectations. I guess it helped that the day was fantastic, with a mild breeze and blue sky. The harbor was jam packed with traffic going every which way. The temperature was just right and the cool breeze into the ferry was just what the doctor ordered for a warm day.I came to discover that seniors (over 65) can ride the ferry for free! So not only did I get to check off a bucket list item, I did it for free. The ride exceeded my expectations and I could have spent all day riding back and forth had I not had a list of things I wanted to do.A great price, a fantastic experience in a beautiful city."

Same feel, same ambiance even the seats were unchanged. I love riding this ferry. Very economical, fast and relaxing. But the best part, the nice view of harbor and HK skyline. I hope to ride this again when I come back to Hong Kong in the future."

Looking out the open windows in good weather is a busy harbour with all manner of traffic.In recent years the Central harbour front land has been reclaimed and the ride is somewhat less than it used to be. Tokens can be bought from the vending machine and it is much more streamlined.It is a singular joy to just 'cruise' across the harbour and back. Nothing changes except the works improving the Central pier area, however it is a longer walk this end where as Kowloon side remains virtually the same year after year.Enjoy your ride!"

This also includes \"light refreshments\", which for us was a soft drink and a slice of rather nice cake.We used the MTR to cross the harbour if we were already on it, but regularly used the Star Ferry to cross it, as it was a far nicer way to experience the crossing and make the most of our holiday.We did the Ferry tour during sunset, so we had great views of both sides of Victoria Harbour in daylight and at night (when it's all illuminated). RECOMMEND YOU TRY THAT... it's like getting 2 cruises for the price of 1.Both sides of the bay are fairly easy to use, you can touch in with an Octopus card or use exact change, or anything else at one of the token machines....You can't say you've been to Hong Kong unless you've used the Star Ferry at least once!"

They're beaut to look at and do the job perfectly. The piers are interesting too, and historic. Some nice shops, but it's the ferries you're going for.Don't fiddle with coins, buy an octopus card at a Metro station (Customer service centre) for a small deposit and load it up with a few dollars. Then you can swipe it on any public transport, like the ferries and avoid every queue. GREAT.Try to pop up the front of the top level of the ferry, you'll get some GREAT pictures, andit's air conditioned. They're very picturesque, and you'll get fab views from the windows of the amazing harbour.Star Ferry have great, cheap, fun cruises, especially the night cruise, try the 8pm one where you can see the lasers from the buildings. But its the neon lights that really take the cake....oh, did I mention that? you get drink and cake on these cruises.Star Ferries are part of HK history."

Although rather a hassle to get on and off when compared to the MRT, this experience is still fun as long as you are not on a tight time schedule. Kowloon to Central is one of the best routes for views, although the new Central Piers are rather a walk from anywhere useful as compared with their previous arrival pier of some years ago.

The turnaround is very fast and the trip takes less than 10 mins.People in Hong Kong are pretty orderly and there was no hassle to get on or off. One of the fun things to do in Hong Kong."

When ticket selling finally opened, the first few people got tickets, then the \"closed\" signed went up!How strange! Were they using a rowing boat, perhaps? A couple of days later we used their terminals for some commuting as part of a larger tour, and were quite impressed with the efficient way they did this day-to-day commuter traffic. So, the premises are a bit down at heel and dingy, but it manages commuter traffic and the ferries themselves are good, but basic. Their reversible seats are good though, if you don't like travelling facing aginst the direction of travel."

The Star Ferry is possibly the oldest and most well-known of all Hong Kong attractions. It consists of several green and white ferrys that go back and forth from Tsim Sha Tsui and Central as well as a newer route from Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai.The ferrys are clean and easy to board. There are two decks - the upper deck is slightly more expensive and has windows / covers whereas the lower deck just has railings. If it is a nice sunny day then the lower deck is a good option and if the weather is a bit wet then the upper deck will keep you dry.The crossing is usually only a few minutes long and gives you some fantastic views of Victoria Harbour. Our two boys loved it and I cannot see any reason why families with small children should be put off. Services are frequent, cheap and fast. It is well worth doing and something that should be on every Hong Kong visitor's 'to do' list!"

It\u2019s about an hour cruise that hits all the main ferry piers. After dark, when the skyline is lit, about 30 of the buildings do a light/laser show each night (8PM). There were buildings on both sides of the harbor to watch and it was quite a sight. If you aren\u2019t taking a cruise, plan to be on the Kowloon side as the buildings on the HK side are much more impressive to watch across the Harbor. Star Ferry (which you can also take during the day) does an evening cruise that puts you out on the water during the show. It\u2019s also used by many of the locals to get back and forth across the harbor. One tip --- if you have a tendency to get seasick \u2013 plan ahead. Once the light show starts, the ferry basically stays in one place, and with the amount of traffic in the harbor, there\u2019s lots of bouncing up and down. Being prepared with whatever seasickness cure you use will help you enjoy the lightshow without worrying. Also, it is very difficult to take photos due to movement of the boat and low light. If the photos are what you are after, you might want to find a viewing spot on the Kowloon Side of Victoria Harbor or in front of the Convention Center on the HK side... Once again, the big banks \u2013 Bank of China, HSBC, Standard Charter and AIG had some of the best lighting effects. Apparently the show is better on weekends, and sometimes they add fireworks --- but the regular show is good too. Show lasts about 10 minutes or so. The single ride night ticket is $100 HK and includes a concession ticket good for a beverage and a cake."

There is also one running with the \"Hong Kong - Asia's World City\" livery which I must agree is very stylish. The normal livery (green and white) though is also easy to spot and truly an icon of Hong Kong. The ferry is probably the most economical way (approx. 2-3HKD) across the harbour (short-haul) and like most public transport in Hong Kong, Octopus card is accepted. However, not recommended for those who get easily seasick although the boat handles waves really well."

It docks right by the Convention center, so you'll have plenty of photo ops for that.
