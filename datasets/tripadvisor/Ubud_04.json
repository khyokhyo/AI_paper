It was just the two of us and her so we could adapt the trek as per our preference, including an earlier finish than originally planned.Loved walking through the villages and taking the local tracks down to the river, crossing it (wasn't expecting wading in waist deep water but all fun), walking the rice fields, chatting to the farmers and visiting locals, including a fantastic art collection/museum. I recommend anyone with a genuine interest in local Bali life to try this tour. Ayu is a lovely guide and I hope the business continues to thrive in the future."

Super friendly, fun and informative - Ayu has great English to match. The trekking was exactly as challenging as we hoped. We got a decent sweat on and was rewarded with a swim in a waterfall. Lunch provided was beautiful too. Prepare to get you shoes and feel wet - it's inevitable, but as it's so warm you don't mind. Would thoroughly recommend this tour."

Ayu was our guide, she picked us up promptly at our villa, and en-route took us to a local market, off the tourist track. We tasted unusual fruits and beans, Ayu told us all about the market and how the locals shopped there. Throughout our journey Ayu explained the areas we were driving through, the Balinese culture and the Hindu religion. We started our hike watching and learning the process of drying the rice, this was a great way to start. We made our way through forests, we crossed rivers, climbed river banks, and emerged breathlessly to the beautiful rice fields. We ate a lovely lunch sitting on rocks in the river, after a refreshing swim. There were no other tourists around, which was fantastic.Ayu took us to villages, she brought us into a local home where we had tea/coffee and ate traditional sweets. She told us all about the homes, what each building was used for and the temples that each home had.Nothing on this trip was too much bother, Ayu was patient when we slowed down, she told us all about her life growing up in Indonesia and provided us with a greater knowledge of Bali. She emailed us after our trip offering help and advice for the rest of our holiday. I can't recommend this hike strongly enough, they are incredibly flexible and will provide a hike to suit your needs."

We saw people working in the rice paddies, strolled through villages, were offered coffee by locals on multiple occasions, and had some coffee. Best of all was trekking through the jungle, where we pushed through dense vegetation to \"find\" a waterfall. Waded downstream through a gorge, with water waste deep at points (there was the option of a different path). Midway we had a lovely lunch (made by Augustin partner) while looking over gorgeous rice paddies. It really felt like going on a hike with a friend who knew the place inside out. One has to be reasonably fit to do the hike we went on, but Augustin also adjusts it based on the ability of participants. We are so glad we went on this tour! This was just an awesome experience."

There were actually no other tourists around and we could see local people working on the rice fields, washing their clothes, or taking a bath in the river. Ayu was very knowledgable about everything and always told us some extra info and background - especially when it came to rice and the full process of growing and harvesting it. She also told us about life in Bali and Indonesia in general, and we learnt a lot by just talking to her about her experience of growing up here. Also, a very large plus is that we scheduled the visit the day before at 10 pm and they were super-flexible to take us on the tour the next morning. And even the next day, after the tour ended, Augustin provided us with some great recommendations on where to spend our remaining time in Bali. Thank you both for the great experience! "

If you're after an adventurous day out, off the beaten track, then this is your type of trip.Ayu picked us up and drove us to our starting point near ubud and within 100 metres we were off the beaten track walking through the rainforest, jumping across creeks, slipping down muddy trails, wading along rivers, climbing ladders, jumping across the top of weirs, crossing rice paddies and learning about the real Bali.Bring your Tevas, Keens or other enclosed toe outdoor water sports shoes or sandshoes to protect your feet, but be ready for them to be wet and muddy at the end of the day.An excellent day out. You need to be reasonably fit and not afraid of walking the edge of drop offs/cliffs etc.We did the medium walk which was 10km of up and down trekking and we slept well that night.Thanks Ayu, The trek, your local knowledge on Bali culture and explaining the farmers way of life combined with your vibrant personality and the nasi campur lunch made it a great day out."

Augustin is a great host who has made friends with the locals of the areas he goes to. You will trek through places not touched by commercial tours and experience things not available on any other tour.We hiked through dense forest, through rice fields, swam in a river with local boys, had coffee with a rice farmer, climbed through ancient structures and watched a cock fight (which may not be for everybody, including me, but helps you get a sense of rural life). Augustin is funny, not afraid to say what he thinks and can answer every question you ask very thoroughly. Can't recommend this tour enough!"

            "review": "Authentic and Beautiful Trek with Amazing Guide. My wife and I booked a day hike with Authentik Bali. Ayu, one of the owners, was our guide. She was prompt for pickup at our hotel and we stopped once to get another hiker before driving to the beginning point. We started the trek walking thru a rural village before getting to the countryside. Bali has changed a lot in the 20 years since we first came here, but once we got to the rice fields, it was like going back in time. This was no tourist hike! We crossed and walked through the river several times, navigated our way across tiered rice paddies, were greeted by workers in the rice fields, children bathing in the river, and even a few cows.There is some scrambling up and down but most of the hike is pleasant and flat. Ayu was a wonderful guide, knowledgeable about the Balinese culture, the flora and fauna, and the environment. She is energetic and passionate about what she does and it shows. She showed us how they grow and harvest rice and took us to where the farmers were using a machine to separate the chaff and bag the rice for sale. She even brought a nice gift for the farmers.There is a simple lunch served that you eat by the river after you climb down from a temple made by Giants. Strangely, one of the highlights of the journey was when my wife and Ayu spied a small puppy that had been abandoned in a drainage canal and rescued it. We took it back to Ubud and Ayu spent two hours with us until we found a rescue shelter willing to take it in. She even changed her dinner plans to make sure the puppy was taken care of. How many tour guides will go this above and beyond? We had a wonderful day with Ayu and our companion and would book this again without hesitation. Authentik Bali is a company with a soul that truly cares about bringing the beauty of Bali to the rest of the world."

She spoke excellent English and had a fantastic rapport with the locals. The walks are varied according to the group with a maximum of 6 people. We walked for 10km, at our pace, took 6 hours but felt pretty tired at the end with the heat. The trek took us to places we would never have experienced otherwise. You need foot ware to manage water, roads and a bit of mud. Something to hold your water bottles would make the walking easier. The trek is pricey but probably worth the amount esp for long term memories! I hope their business goes from strength to strength!"

For an expat he has an amazing knowledge of Bali and in particular the areas surrounding Ubud. Taking you through the rice fields and speaking to the local people you forget that he hasn't lived there all his life. He took us to a spectacular waterfall for a simple but delicious lunch before driving us back to the hotel.Now for everyone who is thinking of doing this tour I feel it necessary to tell you that it is a TREK. We're talking walking through muddy rice fields and bush sometimes with steep inclines in the Bali heat. So you need to be reasonably fit. But it is ABSOLUTELY worth every step to experience the real Bali and some lovely people."

Everything was very well organised (pick-up at the hotel in Seminyak, transport to the starting point by car, food, drinks, etc.) and worked like a Swiss watch. The hiking tour itself was great fun, walking through the jungle, crossing rivers and rice fields. The landscape was phenomenal and the hike was easy to moderate (I had a knee surgery recently and could follow without problems). Agus is very knowledgable with Bali, the landscape, the culture and the local habits.

If you want to meet real farmers in their fields and share a coconut or coffee with them, Agus\u2019 treks are the way to go. No artificial tour fluff or souvenirs in sight, just Bali.

We did not see any other tourists on our hike. If you read the Authentik Bali website or some of the reviews you'll know that Agus picks his routes based on the people in the group on a given day. Our group happened to be suitable for one of the more challenging hikes, which included wading through a small river (water was up to my chest at one point), climbing incredibly steep mud paths, and treading very carefully across rickety \"bridges\" and narrow rice field ridges. You do have to be careful and watch your ankles because the grass often obscures where you can step safely, and you also don't want to ruin what the farmers built with their bare hands.If this kind of hike doesn't sound like fun you should probably let Agus know ahead of time so he can have an alternative in mind. As other reviewers have mentioned, he also shares a lot of interesting information about Bali culture along the way."

The hike itself was a wonderful adventure, thoroughly challenging and fun. We spent a full day soaking in the spectacular scenery Bali has to offer; meandering up and down rice fields, wandering through rivers and waterfalls, visiting local villages and enjoying the warm sun. Throughout the day we took plenty of breaks and had insightful conversations not just on Bali but all sorts of topics. There was no rush, no sense of needing to get anywhere, just time to spend enjoying the journey and the great conversation.Beyond that, what really set the day apart were a couple of fun sections that expanded our expectations for this tour.

I found Bali to be extremely touristy, with the center of Ubud and other towns being packed with street vendors, taxi drivers and massage ladies harassing you on the streets every second, with every street filled with restaurants and shops catering to tourists, with all signs in English. A complete and total sell-out. Hence why I was thrilled to explore the untouched parts of Bali. Augustin was excellent at taking us to some off the beaten path locations. We hiked alone (4 of us) through majestic and peaceful rice fields, visited local villages and learned about the villagers' way of life, even did a very wet hike when we took a shortcut through the river after passing a waterfall (very Indiana Jones like and super fun!). I definitely would not recommend wasting your money going to Bali, as there are maaany other places in SE Asia that offer much more without being so touristy, but if you're really going there, then this tour is really worth it. The beauty in Bali is in the untouched places, not the crowded and messy touristy areas. This tour will show you the authentic exotic beauty that's around."

Pure nature, spectacular landscapes and the river crossing especially was an incredible experience. Augustin is a great tour guide and knows everything from the local language to the landscape itself. All the Local villagers know him and invited us in for coffee and tea. The lunch was overlooking the paddy fields and was very picturesque and very special. I would love to go again on one of his other tours again as it's an experience of a lifetime.Five stars for a very reasonable price! Recommended for people who wish to see the non-touristic natural side of Bali as it was 30 years ago."

If you like experiencing the less travelled road and learn about the culture of the place you are visiting, then Augustin is the right guy for you. We had a fantastic day with him, he takes care of every little detail - even had a water-proof bag in his backpack to carry our mobiles and camera, which we had not thought about. He will pick you up promptly, and takes care of water and food for the day. He also bought a little bird as a present for a family whose home we were going to visit - nice touch. As everybody else is saying, be prepared for some hill climbing and water wading, so you will get wet and dirty, but that is part of the fun. We got to see up close things that we would have never, ever seen if it were not for Augustin, all accompanied by his great sense of humor and his knowledge of the Balinese culture. The jungle, the rivers and cascades, the gorgeous rice pads and the lovely Balinese people. Thank you Augustin for this truly amazing experience!!"

We have been in Bali for almost a week now and this is the best activity and the most fun we had so far! You get a very good view behind the facades of organised taxi tours to prearranged shops and temples. Enjoy the lush green rice terraces while standing inside them, not from a car window or a restaurant terrace, so you can actually see and understand how the rice is grown. Put your finger at the pulse of the island while raising your own a little, climbing up and down dusty hills and crossing shaking bamboo bridges. Take in all the jungle has to offer while wading through a small stream that gently cools your feet. Augustin has an excellent knowledge of the area and the people here and you can learn so much just by talking to him. He speaks excellent English and has a very open mind and personality, so he is very easy to talk to and like. He will show and tell you as much as possible and even brings and carries lunch and water for the hole group, so you really get your moneys worth. He talkes to a lot of locals as he meets them during the hike making jokes and getting the latest news. Plus: if you are even a little bit of a Bear Grills fan: the whole experience has a bit of a \"into the wild\" feel to it. So what are you wating for? Grab your hiking boots or other sturdy footwear (recommended) and some quick drying clothes and book your trek today! (best done a couple of days in advance (a few more in high season) via email)"

The tour took us through beautiful scenarios of rice fields , streams , forest and villages. Our guide Augustine was informative and funny. The trekking started out with walking through some forest eventually leading to the rice fields which seemed endless. Soon enough we were wading through some streams and seeing a more jungle like the locals.There was challenging climbs and challenging treks down hills but and you will get a bit dirty . This is part of the journey. A nice homemade lunch was provided by Augustine and a little rest before the trek continued. Our group was 6 people . Appropriate for the tour at hand. Be advised the sun can be brutal but of course that's why you bring sunscreen . We also met locale rice farmers , villagers and even came upon a cock fight . Overall , a trek that will allow you to see the ' local ' Authentik Bali and mingle locally on a road less seen. A must trek for those searching for a different Balinese view "

The places he took us to were not your typical tourist trap locations - he has genuinely spent time locating trails and families to introduce us to with whom he has built up a friendship. He even brought sweets with him for their new born baby! The one family he introduced us to were the carpenters for the local temple and their home was truly beautiful. He took time to explain everything from the layout of the home to the fact that the kitchen for example is considered a dirty place and that offerings are never made there.Once we were trekking in the jungle we were soon found ourselves wading into the rivers and using the locals paths and mambo bridges - it was amazing. At one point we came across a load of school children waking down the road we were crossing (we were definitely NOT following the road!). It turns out they were going to a local festival to welcome back the spirit of one of the men who had died recently. Augustin then changed his trekking route and we went to the festival too for 30 minutes or so before returning to the jungle once more to continue.We stopped for lunch (which was very nice) in the paddy fields and sat with the guys that were ploughing up the paid fields with the mechanised plough thing (Japanese cow?).Overall this was a truly immersive experience in both the culture and beauty of Bali along routes uniquely discovered by Augustin himself. Very highly recommended for those who don't want the usual tourist experience. Awesome!"

We were really looking forward to this day hike around Ubud and when Augustine first picked us up we asked him to provide us with an adventurous day (he told us that he has about 8 different treks that he has routed out depending upon that day's clientele).We were a group of 6 which is the maximum size that he will take and everyone was in decent shape so it made for a fun day. Our first stop was in a local village at the compound of a fairly well off family. It was neat to see up close and personal. The family certainly likes Augustine!From there, we took off on our adventure hike, off through the rice terraces and down to a little river with a cool, secluded little waterfall. From the waterfall, we trekked down the river (walking in it for about 20 minutes as there was no path along the banks).It got fairly deep at one point (maybe 3 to 3 1/2 feet) so be prepared to get wet and dirty.After the river we stopped for lunch in a quiet corner of the rice fields. Lunch was a traditional Balinese meal and was quite tasty. Then back at it - through a mind boggling maze of rice terraces and then back across a ravine that included crossing a narrow bamboo bridge. Total time spent was approximately 8 hours. At 900k, it was one of the more expensive tours that we have taken so far but it was also one of the best, so we felt that we received good value for our investment and have many good pictures and memories from our day on the Authentik Bali trek."

However I'd been looking forward to it so decided to go - I'm really glad I did.Augustin was friendly and very knowledgeable about Bali, its people & its culture. Originally from Paris, Augustin speaks the local language fluently and has a really kind way with the locals; so much so that as part of the tour we simply walked onto people's land and met the families that lived there and observed their way of life. Augustin bought some flip flops for the little boys of one family & they were absolutely delighted with them; their faces were a picture!We met a family who were carving and painting wood for a new temple, and another from whom Augustin managed to buy a stone for a new ring he wanted. We got to learn about Balinese families, their religion and how they make a living. All of the locals were very kind- simply flash them a big smile as you approach and they'll smile back and wave at you.The day was tiring; we walked up rice paddies, we trekked through jungle, we waded through rivers, but we saw some beautiful scenery.Augustin kept us fed and watered throughout the day.If you want to learn about the Balinese culture and see it first hand, this is the trip for you.TIP - you walk all day, it is hot, it is dirty, and it is wet, so wear sturdy footwear, clothes you don't mind getting muddy and wet & wear bug spray and sun cream - and enjoy! :)"

From walking between the rice paddies to wading through the river it was a fun, interesting day out. I think this was one of the more extreme trecks that Augustin does, it was challenging to say the least! Getting wet and dirty is expected as is a bit of climbing, sliding on your bottom and stumbling into wet holes! We met local people with whom Augustin has a very good and genuine relationship (Augustin is fluent in Balinese). He explains to you their way of life, culture, food, work, living arrangements, architecture and much more. We stood in the river under a waterfall, climbed up and down ravines, walked and waded through a river and ate lunch under the shade of banana trees. On the practical side: Augustin provides lunch and water for the journey. Wear enclosed shoes with grip soles that you don't mind getting wet. Only take a small bag that you don't mind getting dirty. Don't worry about the difficulty level as Augustin tailors the treck for your ability and footwear once he meets you.This was an adventure. We saw the real side of the Ubud region.

Augustus was very good at integrating with the locals and made a huge effort with them, we stopped numerous times and sat down at people's houses. This was great after the first one, two but got a little tedious. I love seeing countries and peoples natural homes etc and I'm all for 'seeing the locals' but I would love to have been more involved rather than sat watching Augustus chat to them. I was also confused about the price (totally my fault) however had I known it was $90 oz dollars I probably wouldn't have come. It was VERY expensive for what you got. I'm really sad that I'm writing this and Augustus is a lovely chap making a great business venture but I'm all for honesty and feedback to improve things.

There is no doubt in my mind why Authentik Bali Tours is rated so highly...it was, hands-down, one of our best experiences in Bali, and truly one of the best experiences I've ever had on a trip anywhere. In one 6-hour span of time, I was: challenged, pushed out of my comfort zone, exhausted, excited, nervous, amazed, educated, and most importantly...enlightened. Make no mistake about it...our trek (and the guide adjusts them all individually based on each group) was not easy. Within the first 10 minutes, we were already in the jungle, I'd already seen a spider the size of my hand (and I'm quite afraid of spiders, lol), and I was sweating like I'd just run a mile...except I'd only been walking for 10 minutes. During the trek, we hiked down to the ruins of a Buddhist Temple, crossed a rope bridge, walked through a mile or two of rice paddies (and even got the chance to help some of the ladies working), climbed/crawled up steep and very muddy hills, through a river, through villages, etc. Two of the highlights for me, though, were 1) getting to visit some kids at a local school, and 2) being invited into two different homes/work areas of local villagers for food, tea, and to see where they live, etc. The graciousness of these Balinese people is remarkable and humbling, and these experiences were only possible because our guide, Augustin, has built sincere relationships with these people. I was muddier and dirtier and more sweaty than ever...but this experience was worth it in ten-fold. Our guide, Augustin, was fantastic. He answered our millions of questions, he taught us tons about the local culture and people, and you can tell that he not only loves what he does, but that he also has a true respect and care for the people has befriended via his treks. If...no...WHEN I return to Bali, I will 100% book another trek with him, and I would highly recommend this to everyone else as well. A truly authentic and rewarding experience...so incredible!"

Jungles, temples, ravines, rice fields - you are sure to see them all! Thank you for the experience of a lifetime, Augustine!"

A mix of jungle, river crossing and walk through the rice fields. A fantastic day that we still feel... after 48hrs. Augustin is speaking the local language and has good connections with the local people which makes we felt welcome by all the folks we crossed. At last but not least, if we have one advice is you guys willing to do this treck need to have the proper walking gear. Expect to come back dirty and that's probably still a week word. Very good value for money and probably the unique occasion to discover what's behind the touristic Bali."

From the beginning to the end the trek was full of fun and learning about how people really live in Bali and there are some sensational sites to see! Augustin was absolutely fantastic and as he knows so many of the locals you get a chance to experience balinese life. Our day was a mixture of river wading and jungle trekking to seeing balinese work, houses and schooling. Augustin we cannot thank you enough for showing us the amazing sites. It has truly been an amazing day. "

            "review": "Eco Cycle Touring. We started the tour with a wonderful breakfast and after 13 miles of mostly downhill cycling, we ended with a very nice lunch. In one of the villages we saw a traditional Balinese home compound. This was the poorer side of Bali that is not part of the 'typical' tourist excursions. We passed through many villages and rice fields on this journey. It was a ride that all levels of ability can experience. Including older children (perhaps 8 or 9) up to older folks in their late 60's or early 70's. For those who wish for a more challenging cycling tour, they do offer a split in the group toward the end with a greater endurance challenge."

This is exactly what we got with Authentik Bali! Agus was an excellent guide and provided a unique experience by exploring local villages, ancient ruins and dense jungle. Agus has a great relationship with the local Balinese which can lead to improvised trips alone the way. I feel as if we could do the same trek on different days and have a completely different experience. If you want to spend the day experiencing the real Bali without running into any other tourist, this is definitely the way to do it. I would highly recommend anyone visiting the island to dedicate spending one day with Agus!!"

We really enjoyed the rice field trip with Augustin our French guide speaking fluently Balinese. He showed us wonderful rice fields and explained a lot of things that are not in books. Then we had a nice cup of coffee in a family house yard. Agus is really a caring person who brought a really new opening to us, enjoying a marvelous discovery although in a manual wheelchair and one member of our group who is blind, had a blast. Thanks a lot Agus! Terima kasih Agus!"

Augustin is a confident, charismatic and intuitive guide that has many connections and friendships with the locals. It was a well-rounded day trip with swimming, jungle trekking, balancing on the rice field terrain and seeing the homes of locals and farmers. He was so generous by always paying for any coffees or drinks along the way and brought us a delicious lunch as well. I feel so grateful for having experienced this and I would recommend it to everyone wishing to experience a true sense of Bali."

If you want to experience what life in Bali is like outside the usual touristy hustle and bustle, Authentik Bali tour is a way to go. Word of warning; if you are relatively young, be prepared to do some considerable jungle trekking :)"

Found Augustin by chance, and the trekking guided by him turned out to the best experience we had in Bali. He chose one of the most difficult trek for us, saying we are younger, and it's full of adventures and surprises! He took us through amazing jungles, rice fields, local villages, river, waterfall.......a path less traveled! It's a childhood dream came true for me and my partner. Augustin is amazing! Reliable, full of knowledge, fluent in local language and experienced! With him in the front, we felt relaxed and nothing to worry about. We enjoyed the whole trip enormously!If someone is interested in listening to the true heartbeat of Bali, Authentik Bali is a must while your stay in Bali. Strongly recommended!"

I actually loved the first one so much I had to book a second one.Augustin is really nice, professional and fun to hang out with during the day trek. He will also teach you a lot about the Balinese culture, which makes this day even more interesting.I also love the fact that Augustin helps you to discover Bali in not a too touristy way. You're going off the roads, in the middle of the rice fields and hang out with the Balinese working there, have a cup of coffee with them, even visit their homes sometimes.To me, that's the best way to see the real Bali.Thanks Augustin!"
