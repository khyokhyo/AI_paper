They swim all day in same pool, no freedom at all........ this was a one time thing...................If you want to book it. Do it directly by their site much cheaper. They have a cab service and pick you up at your hotel."

We paid $160 through Thomas Cook for the Primax 4 experience, and were given $40 cashback.The primax 4 is a group of 4 people, with 45 minutes in the water with your trainer and Dolphin. The trainer explains all about the welfare of the dolphins etc and guides you along the way for what to do. The 45 minutes included a lot of interaction with the dolphin, including the foot push which was incredible! Someone also takes pictures and films the whole thing, and you can purchase different packages and varying costs. I chose the one at $171 dollars which included all pictures and the video on a USB, and one printed image too."

Paid $160 with $40 back in vouchers which I guess is the going rate, in the water with the Dolphins for about 45 mins in which time you pet the dolphins swim with them, they push you in the water and then they kiss you and you kiss them, beautiful creatures and fantastic experience. Then comes the photos, what a rip off, $219 for the CHEAPEST set on digital, what a con that is, I know is is a captive market and I know the money is to be put back into protecting dolphins but that is just criminal."

One of the best experiences in my life, from start to finish could not fault a thing, the trainers priority was always the dolphins, they explained all about their life and the problems we are causing them and then the fun bit, getting in the water with them so hard to explain just how good they make you feel only sad part is as soon as the session ends you are rushed off to buy their photo's and these are silly prices, top package \u00a3300 or \u00a325 per photo, the ending spoiled a superb day"

The plus side of delphinus.Our trainer harry made my son feel great with the dolphins as he's only 9 and didn't want to do a couple of things like the foot push and the dance with a dolphin.  In our area we had the grandma of some of the dolphins in delphinus, and 2 other dolphins. The environment for the dolphins is great it's more like their natural habitat and not like the swimming pool attractions for dolphins you see, and it was on this basis we chose delphinus. The negative side. The photos are ridiculously expensive, you would think that having already paid the amount you have paid that these should be a lot cheaper than they are. I know that equipment is expensive and photo paper to print on can be to but surely you must be able to do it cheaper. Luckily we had somebody with us In my partner who was able to get a few good shots and videos of the whole day so we still had memories of our day. Lovely place just please try and make your photo and video packages cheaper."

We booked the silver experience for myself, my partner and 19 year old daughter. What a great experience. We were in a group of 4 with a dolphin, the trainer and a photographer in one area of a large dolphin enclosure. We got to stroke the dolphin, dance with the dolphin, we kissed her , held her fin, she danced round us, splashed us, did other tricks with us. My partner and daughter had the \"push up\" in the middle of the enclosure where you stand still with your hands in the air and two dolphins swim up behind you and literally push you up out of the water. As I'm not a confident swimmer I declined this and instead I was pulled across the enclosure holding onto the dolphins fin, fantastic experience!!The staff were all so friendly and made you feel at ease in the water.We purchased a photo album and video of our experience, which wasn't cheap but it was a fantastic memoir of a great experience, and it was delivered direct to our hotel by 10.00 am the following morning. The enclosure was spacious and clean and the dolphins were all healthy and happy.10/10"

The trainers were knowledgeable and kind, answered all of our questions about dolphins. We live in Florida and can swim with dolphins at several places but this experience was by far better than anything offered here at home. You actually get to interact with the dolphins and get a sense if their intelligence and their power. We recommend the package that includes the foot push because it is truly once in a lifetime. They do provide towels and lockers. Do not wear sunscreen because it is harmful to the dolphins. I also feel that the picture packages are pricey but if the company continues to good work for the environment, then I am happy to pay it."

We booked via Thomsons and got the bronze package as I am disabled and I did not feel I could spend longer in the water or put on a wet suit. With the bronze package you go in the water in your own swim suit and a life jacket. This was such an exciting experience.We were fortunate to have an excellent English-speaking trainer and Yakum, a beautiful male dolphin. There was just my husband and I in our group so we were very lucky to get Yakum, and for a time Kira as she was not in the mood to interact with her group, to ourselvesWe got to kiss and play with Yakum for 45 minutes and our photographer Lucely took so many good photographs that in the end we brought the full package on a usb which included a video clip of our full swim with Yakum filmed by Luis.All the staff were welcoming and so helpful, towels and lockers were provided and we showered first to remove chemicals and lotions to protect the dolphins.People have debated about this kind of experience as being wrong and not good for the Dolphins, however I would disagree.The dolphins are well cared for and like Kira proved if they do not want to interact they do not. This facility specialises in ecology and research to improve the world and how we use the planet."

I've been recommending Delphinus Riviera Mexico to all my friends since coming back- 100% will be returning as soon as possible to check up on the developments (fingers crossed for some more baby dolphins!). We had a superb time with Harry, our hilarious and understanding (Scottish!) trainer, and a young male dolphin whose name I sadly can't remember but whose kiss was extremely memorable. All the dolphins seemed happy and stimulated, and the trainers were extremely knowledgeable about how to care for them, the right kinds of food and exercise they needed, etc. The only thing I would say is don't come expecting a cheap photograph, as they're super expensive, but do come for a fantastic time with the dolphins- not many people can say they've actually swum with these incredible, gentle and clever creatures!"

However this was not the case and ended up in a group of 5 which is not what we had paid for. Delphinus was really good and apologised and offered us another slot but would mean another 1 hr45 minute wait or toJoin the other couple which we did! The occasion was really good and would recommend it although the Dolphin was abit naughty and wanted to go and play with the other dolphins it made it more fun. I was a non-swimmer and the staff was brilliant and made sure I did what the rest of our group did. Would definitely recommend it.

We were asked for our ID which we didn't have as we were not told by Delphinus when booking that we needed it. The guy on the desk was however very helpful and understanding that we only had our confirmation to hand as our ID was back at the hotel. We paid for dolphin ride which was 30mins of fun in the pool with a dolphin. Our dolphin showed off to us for a while, splashing us, waving and creating waves around us. Our time ended with the dolphin pulling us through the water whilst holding onto her dorsal fin. We were advised that we couldn't buy the photos online, however we found the website with the photos from the day available to purchase.

If you think your going to get close up with the Dolphin then think again as it is very routine for the 40mins. Our dolphin did not want to do tricks which was not a problem as I felt really sorry for her, also she seemed to have a bad Eye but when I asked the subject was changed.For the foot push we was told to go to another Dolphin as this one was sick and again when I asked what was wrong the subject was changed. I left the experience feeling really sorry for them and wished they was in the Ocean.These intelligent Mammels would be free if it was not for the Money they make for the owners.Would I do it again and would I recommend it, No."

Only issue & only issue at that is the prices of the photos!! $52 for ONE PHOTO & a frame. Yes one photo!!

This is on for around 5 minutes, then you are put into groups & taken to the dolphins.The actual experience was amazing & the swim lasted for around 50-60 minutes.Now onto the only bad point - pictures, I think there are around 4 different packages you can purchase. We went with the 3rd package (I think), we got a photo in a frame, couples dream swim t-shirt & all of the pictures taken put onto a memory stick & a short video.The packages are expensive but they are worth it, you can haggle the prices down a bit, we ended up paying around $230.Would we do this again? The answer is no, but for us this was a decision we both made before the swim, just because our next holiday to Mexico we will explore new things."

Once you have your buoyancy aid fitted there is a briefing on what to do and not do, all very light hearted and easy going but fairly important information. You do get the real feeling the staff and company care about the Dolphins and the environment in general. You then get allocated a guide, photographer and area for you and your family. The place is very clean and the swimming areas are kept as natural as possible. Not those horrible pools you see at theme parks and hotels. Had a wonderful hour with the Dolphins up close and the highlight was the foot push. If you have any nervous they completely put you at ease and you are not forced to do anything you are uncomfortable with. It was a truly magical experience. The only thing I would comment on as a negative is the cost of the photo/video. You can't really take your own and although they are pretty good quality the mid range package works out close to \u00a3250. So do work that in to your budget as they are a great reminder of a wonderful experience."

We were picked up on time by a friendly chap and once we are on our way, we had to watch a video in the minibus. Think this might be a ecological requirement as it was little to do with the experience and more to do with the environment. We had been recommended by our tour company due to Delphinus having better animal treatment that the Dolphins in our hotel, the Gran Bahia Coba. My son did the experience with another family as I watched. He had a good time and was really happy. The spectator viewing area is positioned so as to make it very difficult to take your own photos. Once he was finished, he really wanted some pictures. I was astounded at the cost, and given the uniqueness of the experience, I think the management know they can really push the prices up to their captive audience. The prices start at $39 for one photo and go up. Some packaged offer a DVD with your photos which is largely obsolete given most of us cant put a disk in our computers anymore. We ended up paying over $170 for a photo book, we were told it had to be compiled in Cancun so would be delivered to our hotel the next day. Given the surly and uninterested attitude of the staff in the gift shop, and the fact that we were leaving 2 days later. I checked and double checked the details and they reassured me that the book would be delivered the next day. We would leave the day after that. At time of writing, we are now home and the book as not arrived. Some email correspondence with our rep tells us that the book was delivered a day after it was promised to a hotel I had never heard of (not even in our resort). We will continue to pursue this and i expect the book to be delivered to the UK in good condition. My son is very disappointed and I find it unacceptable that customers are expected to pay more that the price of the experience for the photos of that experience. Would not recommend, as something as special as swimming with Dolphins should leave you with a positive memory and some pictures that didn't cost over $150. Sadly, I'm not sure that any other operators are any better based on talking with people around the pool. Do i have photos to share?........I wish I did, they have my money!"

Our hotel had a large pool with 6 dolphins, however we didn't agree with the conditions that they were kept in. Delphinus were recommended and although I'm no expert in dolphin conservation, the environment was much better - an enclosed sea lagoon and the dolphins seemed very happy.The activity involved just our family of 3 with the dolphins for just under an hour. This involved getting to know the dolphins, a few tricks, a leap over the top of us and the legendary foot push - where a pair of dolphins raise you out of the water like Posiedon and propel you along the length of the pool. Superb experience, however the sting in the tail is the price of the photography, which was not far short of the activity cost. You can haggle, but not by much. They bank on you wanting a record of something that in your minds eye, you'll never forget.All in all though, I'd do it again."

I could not stop smiling the whole time. Such beautiful and intelligent creatures who perform because they clearly love it. Staff very professional and caring. Lots of tricks ie, kiss, selfie(delphie), dancing and the best was the foot push where i was pushed up into the air by 2 dolphins! An absolute dream come true. Beware though the photos for this experience were extortionate! I bought them as i will probably never experience it again."

We did the primax 4 so it was only our family. I read reviews and was prepared for high cost to buy pics and videos. It was very reasonable. 230.00 USD. We didn't get the largest package for 266.00 that included the small photo book. Which they reduced to 250 to encourage us. Reason being you could not pick out which photos u wanted in the book. They picjed pics for boom. Also you could not upgrade to a larger size book. We received a USB drive with video and all photos and 4 free wooden 8x10 frames. Gave an online link to view photos but it never allows me to save them to my phone. Was worth the money. The water is disgusting...not sure if we were swimming in dolphin poop...tried not to think about it."

I went with my partner however there was loads of family's around. I would say the youngest guest I could see was 4. The Dolphins were out of this world. So intelligent and amazing. Facilities were great showers, toilets, lockers and tubs by the side of the pool for shoes. Towels are given as you exit the pool. All staff were friendly, approachable and happy right down to the bus driver. A lot of the reviews I have read have been negative in regards to the cost of photos. No you can't take your own however the quality of the photos taken are incredible so definitely worth the cost especially if this is a 'one of lifetime experience'. We paid 3000ish pesos for 12 digital images on a cd. The gift shop had lots to choose from for example cuddly toys, pens and clothing. Drinks and ice creams were also available to purchase. Not too expensive either. The activities included foot push, stroking, kissing, dancing and tricks by the Dolphins. The trainers were also amazing, great scenery also. "

            "review": "Great Experience for the Children but Very Expensive Pictures!. We booked the Primax 4 package for my two children (15 and 12) at our resort and once at Delphinus, we upgraded to the Couples package for $25.00 U.S. (each) more. The kids had a blast! We checked in and then went to another area where we initially sat in a theatre for a long time watching video's showing how the organization is environmentally conscience. Finally, someone came in and each group of people were assigned a different trainer. Our two children were taken to an area away from the theatre and main water cages, where there was more privacy and the 45 minute private couples session began. Our children loved it, they got to have the dolphin swim around them, pet it, be taken for a ride on its fin and were taken for a foot ride by two dolphins..that was certainly worth the $136.00 U.S. each. Given we were in an elevated shaded pathway with no one around we were able to take photographs of the children and the dolphin (the brochure tells you not to take your camera past the lobby). Another father was doing the same thing for his child and wife. While the trainer was doing the different tricks with the dolphin, to us observing from a distance, it felt like it was more of a photo shoot than an interactive experience. After the 45 minutes were up, the children were taken to shower and dry off and then we met them in the photo house. Here we looked at all the photos and video that were taken with the children and then they hit you with the price. They wanted over $500.00 U.S. for the entire package, which is absolutely human greed at its worst! The other lower packages weren't much better. In our case, most of the shots, the kids had their eyes closed or weren't smiling, so we picked the best picture of both the kids together and for $51.00 U.S.D., we got one picture of the kids in a Delphinus picture frame, and the picture didn't even fit properly in the frame.Overall, the children said it was the best experience they have had so far during our Mexican vacation, so I would highly recommend it. However, please be aware of the outrageous prices for pictures and make sure you bring your own camera if you are just observing. You may just get the chance to save hundreds of dollars like we did and take your own pictures! Oh ya, remember, no sunscreen for the dolphins please."

I can honestly say it was the best experience of my life. Jade was our trainer and we swam with Ich. Jade was amazing, she is fantastic at her job and you can see how much she loves all of the dolphins. While we were there she showed us a cut that he had near his tail. Jade cleaned it and showed us how they care for them if they get hurt which i found really nice. Its clear she has an amazing relationship with them. This was by far the highlight of our holiday and i would do it again without a doubt. We got all of the pictures that were taken along with the video of 2 large prints in a frame, although some people may say its expensive, i don't agree. Its an experience of a lifetime and the money is SO worth it. I would come and do it all over again when i an in Mexico again next year as it is a fantastic day and the pictures were all amazing. Its something i will never forget and this is something EVERYONE should do at some point. Thank you for a great time and especially to Jade and Ich for making it so special x"

We booked through First Choice travel agents and they arranged pick up and drop off which was prompt and comfortable. Around a 30 minute drive away from our hotel - Luxury Bahia Principe Akumal.We paid for the Silver package which meant we were a group of four with nobody else. This is recommended if you have a group of four, otherwise you'll be sharing your time with other groups.We got an hour with the dolphins while they performed their tricks for us, and we got a good length of time petting them and doing one-on-one tricks like kissing them, holding their fins and the foot push, where you lay flat on the surface and two dolphins lift you out of the water by your feet and push you at full speed to the other side of the water. Only some packages let you do this, so if you can afford a package where you can - do it.They are all well looked after and have plenty of space to swim and co-exist, and it was evident that the trainers had a strong bond with them.The one minor downside was that our family members were not allowed through with us to observe and take photos of their own, which we felt was intentional to try to get us to buy the professional ones which are highly priced. We were offered 100 photos and a 10 minute video for $210, which we split four ways to reduce the cost. If you're part of a couple or on your own though, that's a lot of money. We felt more comfortable since we knew that the money went back into taking care of the dolphins and other animals in the nearby eco park.Regardless, this was the highlight of our trip to Mexico and not to be missed out on. Some packages are steeply priced but it's well justified!"

A real must do experience whilst in the Riviera Maya. They talk you through how to touch the dolphin and allow you to have some great hands on experience. They have their own photographer which is one to a group and he got some amazing photos (you are not allowed your own phone or camera inside). Included in the experience is a foot push which is such an amazing experience that words can not describe so please do it!The amazing photos the photographer took cost a lot of money. We paid 140USD for 12 photos on a disk(after a little negotiation).We paid for the photos only because we wanted to have the memories to keep for a lifetime and that's what they play on. We thought about buying the rest on-line but they are just as expensive at 39USD each or 187USD for 5 to 10 and 210USD for 11 or all. I personally think the photos could have been a bit cheaper as the experience its self was a lot of money.There are cheaper places to swim with the dolphins such as at the hotel we stayed at but the conditions are very cramped which although the dolphin's are not aware of any difference its not nice to see. Here they have more space and don't get forced to participate if they don't want to.A little thing to note , you should not wear a watch or wedding ring when you go they ask you to remove all of this prior to the swim. My wife lost her fitness watch while there and they did very little to help locate it and also never replied to emails that we had sent over or to our rep when they contacted them about it this made the day even more expensive (completely my wife's own fault)."

We were 2 of only a few people there and we should have been in a group of 4 but were lucky enough that it was just us for the whole 45 minutes with our dolphin, Ich, which meant we got to do more, like brush his teeth and rub honey onto his sores. I was a little apprehensive as I am an animal lover and don't like to see them caged, but they really do take great care of the dolphins there, and you can tell how much the dolphins love the interaction. I wish I could remember the name of our trainer (begun with J) as she was brilliant and very knowledgeable about the dolphins.

We visited at the beginning of June and did the Primax 4 swim and it was absolutely amazingly, we'll never forget it.As the name suggests there was only 4 of us in the group with our trainer, Angel and our wonderful female dolphin, I think Angel said her name was Xel Ha (Princess of the Water) but not sure if we heard that right or if it's spelled correctly (maybe I'm confusing her with the name of the place nearby). Our visit was educational as well as enjoyable. We had a video to watch first and some safety instruction then we were led away in groups to meet our trainer and dolphin. After a basic introduction to our dolphin with some splashing and singing we were more or less straight in at the deep end and were the first group to do the foot push. We had to swim to the middle of the enclosure and float with our arms outstretched and wait, then they came, two dolphins, one on each foot, and before you know it you're raised almost out of the water and skimming the surface, it's absolutely breath taking.We were in the water for 45 minutes and this amazing, graceful, creature allowed us to stroke her, kiss her, dance with her, she jumped over us, swam round us, sang, splashed, and gave us an unforgettable experience. We're still smiling.After coming out of the water you're given a towel and taken up to view your photos. There are three photograph packages, we bought the middle one which gave us a USB with all of our photos, a video and 2 printed photographs of our choice. Yes, they are expensive but they're professional photos, the video is excellent and it's potentially a once in a lifetime opportunity. We didn't take enough money with us but that wasn't a problem, our photos were brought to our hotel later that day and we paid for them on delivery, at no additional cost.We were told that there was an app we could download to our mobile phones to be able to view our photos but I've not been able to find out how to do this. Would be great if we could do this as it's easier to show people rather than carry the USB around.Even though we've said it's a once in a lifetime opportunity we would definitely do this again with Delphinus."

We had 2 dolphins - Xel Ha and Xcaret (named after the parks as they were born on the sites), they were both female and were pregnant. Our 45 minutes in the water was amazing, definitely a once in a lifetime experience and was well worth the 279$ that we paid for the trip. We did a number of exercises with the Dolphins including foot push which was amazing. The biggest let down and the reason I didn't give the trip 5* was because the photograph cost was (in my opinion) very expensive. For the bottom package it was $299 and that didn't include the video. We managed to haggle a bit with the staff there and get a USB stick with all of our photos and an 8 minute video for $220 however this took a lot of haggling and arguing. I think the photograph price needs to he seriously looked into by management at Delphinus as for the time it takes to upload them onto a USB stick, it doesn't justify the cost."

The experience was amazing, got plenty of time with the dolphin and even did a foot push out of the water. It was truly a fantastic day and the guide we had was brilliant with us. As there is no allowance for us to take our own photos, we felt the need to buy from them. The prices start at 40 us dollars for 1 photo, which is outrageous. We decided to buy a package of 70 photos and an 8 minute video for 229 dollars, which again is ridiculously expensive, but as it was a once in a lifetime opportunity we decided to buy them. We didnt have that much money with us there and then as we didnt realise how expensive it would be, but they offer a service where they deliver to your hotel for a scheduled time, which is very good. They arranged for between 6 and 7:30 pm. After waiting in the lobby for 2 and half hours and phoning them and our concierge trying to contact them, we gave up and were disappointed. Then, when back in our room we had a phone call from the driver saying he would be with us in 15 minutes. We rushed back to the lobby and finally at half past 9 they turned up with the USB and expected us to pay for the delivery on top of the photos. This poor service was really shocking and upsetting. All in all, the experience is amazing! But the photos are expensive and unless you take enough money with you, then be prepared to wait around for your photos."

The dolphin pools are tiny and shallow enough to stand up in! The water is in desperate need of filtration, and the place has a foul smell of rotten fish and for lack of a better word sewage."

The whole experience is totally amazing. Our trainer Margartia was brilliant also. I was a little nervous but this soon went. You can get up and personal with the Dolphins, from tail spins to toe pushing. We had 3 dolphins (Melissa was one name, can't remember other 2). They swim around you, interact with you. You kiss them, stroke them, and at the end get a selfie with them.All in all its the best experience I have ever had and would do it again in a heart beat. You also get transportation to and from your hotel for free. Only negatives I have is the cost of the prices for the photos at the end. We didn't have enough money on us and were devastated we didn't bring enough money with us."

We recently took our six year old to do the platform experience and it was really really good, the ethos of the park is fantastic and the staff are so committed to the wellbeing of each dolphin. It was a fantastic experience and our trainer took the time to talk to our six year old and get him familiar with the dolphins to alley his fears. What really spoilt it for us and the reason I have only scored a three was the photo package prices. They increased the price because there were three of us to $134 dollars for a disc or $183 for a disc and video. The other couple in our group were being charged $95 & $130 respectively for three less photos and a video which included us. We ended up buying one photo and leaving feeling conned and very disappointed. It appears expensive photo packages are the in thing in the riviera maya. And they won't allow spectators or your own camera."

I don't know of its sincere or just to make you feel better about the captivity of the dolphins. It did seem very machine like. \"Stand here. Do this. Hand out. Kiss dolphin.\" Next person.However, still worth the money for the experience. My only other interaction with dolphins was in the wild with spinners in Hawaii. I think I preferred just getting to be in the water with them in their world. Just didn't get to touch them."

Plenty of time with the dolphin (45 minutes in the water). Staff was well trained and the dolphins were clearly well cared for. This location is a breeding location for other dolphin park locations. Cost was $129 US Dollars. We used hotel credits and paid $26, which was clearly worth it. Did not include transportation which they provide at $12 per person.The park/facility is nice but do not expect the size and commercialized aspect of an American park. Since you can't bring electronics or phones into the water you are unable to take your own photos. They will hit you with the photo packages at the end, starting at around $180. A video of the event which looked awesome was about $85. We settled on two photos (with frame or without) at $40 a piece. One for my daughter and one for my niece. The costs can add up. Probably would not return a second time but greatly enjoyed my time here."

Constant interaction directed by our very friendly and knowledgeable trainer who obviously had a very close relationship with the dolphins. We pre booked directly online via email as we qualified for 50% senior discount - indeed it was my birthday so what a way to spend it!!The surroundings were lovely - a natural sea water pool, not at all like an aquarium, which added to the naturalness of it all. All the dolphins we saw were clearly very well looked after and happy. They seemed to absolutely love the human contact and were very confident around us, helping us to get the best from our time with them.We were under no illusions as to the cost of the photos having read the reviews, so it came as no surprise to us. They do several packages - we chose the video and all photos for $300 - we got 103 photos and a video on a USB stick and were not at all disappointed - they are a fabulous set of photos which totally reflect our enjoyment and that along with a very well put together video is a perfect memory - I would have always regretted not buying them. In summary - an absolute must if you are in the area - we cannot recommend this highly enough - you will always treasure the time spent with these very special animals........ and just accept the extortionate cost of the photos as you will never capture that moment again"

The whole experience was great, we loved it.Be warned, they will snap away at you with a camera and then offer you the pictures when you come out which are ridiculously expensive. Hundreds of dollars for a package and one single picture is $40 per person so if there are two people in the picture its $80 even if it\u2019s only one picture! The whole place is carefully designed to stop anyone taking their own pictures too so you won't get around it by asking anyone else to photograph you. We politely refused to buy any which was a shame. We don't mind paying premium prices as I guess it helps with their breeding and environmental program costs but these prices were just unreal.All in all, worth a visit but be aware of the cost of pictures if you want them!"

A side note the guacamole here was the best we've had!Opportunities for Improvement:The website did not indicate that there was a fee for parents to watch and enter so an additional charge of $15.00US per person was unexpected. Since we where not staying at a hotel and emailed to inquire about pick up and drop off well in advance we still did not receive a reply so we took a taxi there and asked for a ride back which they declined.

March 9th 2016Exciting times, three of us decided to take the opportunity to swim with the Dolphins and we chose Dolphinus because is was in natural surroundings with sea water.

He was faultless, his knowledge and the time he gave us was impeccable.The whole experience was first class but the three of us did keep noticing that our photographer seemed to be picking her nails or looking in a different direction which concerned us as we were looking forward to purchasing our photos. Viewing our photos! Very expensive packages but when you know the money goes back into looking after the Dolphins you don't mind however in our case it was disappointing because our foot push, Dolphins jumping over us and crucial photos were either not taken or from an angle that just wasn't right or do justice.Our video was much better but to purchase to video you had to have a certain package. So we ended up paying $281 just to get a handful of decent photos and a video. Totally ripped off and very disappointed as we can't get that time back.We feel you need to make sure your photographers do a proper job in the future. I don't mind paying for anything if it's a good service but that was shocking."

The silver experience guarantees that you are swimming within a group of 4, so as there were 6 of us we had to sign a document to say we were happy swimming as a group of 6, which we were. This meant that we got 55 minutes with the Dolphins, rather than 45 minutes. As this was our first time swimming with dolphins, the experience is amazing! They do genuinely seem to really care about the Dolphins and there well-being. Our guide was fantastic, very informative and answered any questions we had and gave us a real inside to their day-to-day living. The footpush is amazing! The only thing I was gutted about was that the dancing with the dolphins wasn't involved or a tail swim. It was great fun for all of us. A big downside, evident from the reviews, is the cost of the photos, which is RIDICULOUS. As a group of 6, the minimum cost of a photo package was $379! This price seemed to change depending on how many of you there were participating, which is understandable, but nearly $400 is very pricey! A lot of these photos had our eyes closed, so we queried if we could have these photos taken out of the package, and have a cheaper price. The lowest they would go was $360 which we refused. For one photo the price was $40, which isn't as ridiculous, but they did not taken photos of couples. If they did this, we would have purchased a single photo of 2 of us each, but not prepared to pay $80 each couple when we just spent nearly $800 on the excursion itself. A tip for Delphinus is to bring the price of the packages down, as nobody on our time slot brought even a single photo due to the price. The only type of people I can imagine spending this sort of family's but if the price of the packages decreased, a lot more people would purchase them! As the photos came on a USB stick, none of the photos were printed, which meant we would have gone home to print them also. This obviously does not cost Delphinus a lot to do apart from paying for a photographer. It's a real shame to come away from an amazing experience and not have any photos to show from it unless you're prepared to pay an extortionate amount.I can't recommend the experience enough, our guide was great, the Dolphins were brilliant and it made our first experience with Dolphins amazing. However, next time I would probably go elsewhere to have more interaction with the dolphin and buy photos at a more reasonable price."

You can tell they really do care about the animals general welfare because they tell you to take off everything jewelry wise/hair clips etc and shower off your sunscreen because the chemicals can harm them.We had approximately 20 minutes in the water and were put into little groups, me and my sister were placed with a small girl whose parents were not participating, throughout the whole thing they take photos and film. The trainer makes sure you all get a good turn with the Dolphins (we had 2) and each one of you gets a chance to perform the behaviour with them.It's just such a shame that the packages for photos are so ridiculously expensive because when you have just come out and had this beautiful experience, you can't help but feel the photos/video side of things is just a massive money making scheme, or that if photos were able to be purchased separately or in smaller clusters they'd have more people who wanted to buy them!I would have also been interested to see where the Dolphins are kept in the evenings / event of non-interaction as the lagoons for interaction were slightly smaller than I had anticipated."

After a mix up at Xcaret yesterday, where we thought we were buying a great dolphin encounter but ended up having a downgraded one, we were offered free tickets for here for today (thanks Alina). We had paid $99 US each yesterday and upgraded by another $25 each today for the full encounter experience. Our family group of 3 had 45 minutes in the water with 2 beautiful friendly dolphins assisted by vet Maria (who made the experience very special for us). Whilst the kids enjoyed the big tricks, like being pushed along by your feet and being jumped over, I preferred the quiet interactions with these amazing creatures. Maria also pointed out a skunk and toucans! This is very expensive but we loved every minute. I have to laugh at the ridiculous prices of their photo packages, hundreds of dollars. What a shame, I bet very few people purchase them. If it was $50 every one would. The bad thing is your family on the shore are given only tantalising peeks of you and can not get access to take your own photos. I think the pools here were preferable to the ones at Xcaret."

We were shocked at how reasonable it was while we were on our honeymoon! They even offered incentives if you booked Delphinus & another excursion through the one guide at our hotel (Secrets Capri). We had an incredible experience- our belongings were kept safe in lockers, we watched an instructional video, and then we got to go in the water. We booked the 4-person experience, which was fabulous because we got more time to interact with the dolphins, rather than having to wait around. The dolphins were so sweet, and we really loved doing the foot push! One positive aspect that I would like to point out is that we were with a couple from Chile, and they didn't know any English at all. The guy that took care of our group was amazing with keeping everything going while trying to switch back and forth between English and Spanish. He didn't miss a beat. We had a blast interacting with the other couple, even though there was a language barrier. One small aspect that I didn't like is that after we locked our stuff up, we weren't really sure what we were supposed to do or where to go. We kind of just figured it out on our own. Overall, however, it was a really awesome experience!"

An hour with the Dolphins, the trainer tells you educational aspects of the animal as well as spending time with them, The main part in the silver package is the dolphins pushing you through the water with a jump. You receive a life jacket which is great as you realise you do not need to move your feet. My boyfriend was a spectator however he had to stand quite far away. Images are pricey at $40 and for a 12pc package around $105 Lovely morning and a lifetime experience."

As I didn't know if I would ever be able to do it again, I opted to do \"The One\" package, which is one person, one dolphin for one hour (though more like 45 minutes). My trainer's name was Jade and I was paired with Grandpa, a 32 year old male, who is the second largest dolphin they have. He had a couple of issues, but he was a sweetheart and loved to have his belly rubbed. All the tricks were fun, but just rubbing him and seeing his enjoyment was more than enough. My one annoyance was the photo packages. Basically it is the cost of another encounter if you want to get all the photos (some were good, the rest kind of blah) and the video. Also for the amount of money they cost, they don't really take very many. The other little issue I had was that the ticket people almost didn't give me my free t-shirt, so be sure what each package includes before you arrive."

The dolphin did some tricks and we were able to interact with them and touch them which was fun. Our dolphin had a couple of rake marks (scratches) and a sore on its beak but we were told this is due to them playfighting with each other but of all the dolphins we saw they looked in great condition.

You pay a seriously large sum just for the experience. Additionally photos cannot be taken within the pools and bay so if you want documented memories of your experience you best be willing to pay for them... You can negotiate on the prices but for the videos and photos on a memory stick you're looking at around a \u00a3200 starting price.I feel this is partially charged in reason for the effort in maintaining the sanctuary, yet as admirable as it may be to protect dolphins and the environment; I still struggle to find the prices hard to justify."

It has always been my dream to swim with dolphins and I wasn't disappointed. We got a long time in the water with them. There were four of them to three of us to begin with. The Trainer Margarita was fab.The animals are so gentle, they really are. To be that close is amazing. Our daughter didn't want a kiss and couldn't do the push but she thoroughly enjoyed feeding them. Towels and life vests are provided and these are ample. Transfer time from Grand Palladium was around 25minutes. I took quite a bit of money with me, but nowhere near enough for the photos. It cost us an extra $20 to have them delivered to our hotel. They are very very expensive, the most expensive USB we've ever bought. The DVD is around 10minutes long and is well worth it to see our faces. Would definitely recommend Delphinus for the silver package booked through First Choice. We also got $40 each back for booking through resort to use off another trip."

Though the trip was expensive, I felt we were not rushed and had a thoroughly enjoyable time. I'm not a confident swimmer but the use of a life vest and consideration by the instructor was very good. A big disappointment was not being able to take any personal photos. The pictures taken were average but felt obliged to purchase them to capture such a fantastic experience."

First we went in the pool with Freda the dolphin and her trainer Carla, Freda's baby was also there which was really nice to see they hadn't split the Dolphins up. The pool was huge and the Dolphins seemed really happy! There tricks were amazing and I was a bit nervous but Carla made me feel at ease with the Dolphins and told me lots of things about the Dolphins too. We also got to feed a manatee which was the best! I loved learning about their habitats and the animals all seemed happy which made me feel a better as I had been dubious about them being in captivity. Would highly recommend!!! :)"

The trainer spent time explaining about the Dolphin and what we could do safely and also that the Pale was picked as he had the best temperament to work with our daughter.A fantastic day out and felt that we had a lot longer with the Dolphin than we thought we would have as they tell you it will only be 30 minutes I am sure it was about an hour.It was worth paying the money for and is a must do if you are there."

They are charitable and ecologically active, helping wild dolphins, ocean projects etc and all their dolphins are either rescued or bread in house; none taken from the wild.The trainers are very knowledgeable and teach you about the dolphins on your visit, not just going through tricks (although they do many!)We booked through our Thompson resort rep, booking the \"Dolphin Silver\" package and it was perfect. Just a group of four in the water with the Dolphins for an hour, it included the foot push where 2 Dolphins will push you through the water... Amazing!If you plan to do a dolphin swim go with Delphinus, they really care about you and the animals. Also book through Thompson / First choice if they are your agent as they negotiate the best terms on all their Mexico excursions. We rated 5* due to the above, but as many others mention the photo packages are too expensive."

The pool was pretty crowded, but they arranged it so that this isn't an issue. After the swim, someone takes you to look at the film and pictures they took of you. They took 100 pictures of us, which most of them were with eyes closed or from weird angles, but there were about 10-15 that we really liked. I swam with Dolphins before in egypt and new zealand, so I took some money for (often overpriced) pictures, but they are a nice way to remember the experience. Then the lady told us the prices: she started with an package that cost over 300 dollars. After our initial shock, we asked what our other options were. She told us some more options, where the cheapest was 220 dollars for 12 pictures on a cd. SERIOUSLY?! After a while she told us there was another option, for 40 dollars you could buy 1 picture that came with a frame and for 90 dollars you could buy the dvd. However, they did not film the entire thing, only the beginning. I understand they want to (and need to) make money, but this is just ridiculous! To ask people almost the same amount they pay to swim with the Dolphins, for some pictures and a dvd of a part of the swim! I asked them and they said these prices were normal in this area. Which is just rubbish. I would recommend swimming with the Dolphins, but don't get your hopes up for too many pictures unless you're willing to pay about 750 dollars per couple! It's a Rip off, no doubtabout it!"

After swimming with the dolphins in Cuba and being really disappointed I was apprehensive but this was amazing. A quiet & serene experience interacting with the dolphins with a knowledgeable trainer. My partner was asking a lot of questions in terms of how much the dolphins work doing tricks etc but it definitely came across that they have the dolphins best welfare in mind. I wont go into too much detail of the actual experience as I don't want to spoil it for you but its a must and I highly recommend and one I will remember. BUT the one massive downfall here is the extortionate prices for photos. It is totally unnecessary to charge that much. $40 per photo absolute rip off, the bundle of CD photos was ridiculous. Plus they didn't take one of me and my partner together with the dolphins so you have to buy 2, one of each of you. If the photos were cheaper we would have definitely got one so by charging so much they are losing money. Everyone on our coach was discussing the ridiculous high prices and no one bought any. But in terms of the experience you will not be disappointed."

But we were beyond disappointed when we found out that the most basic picture package (12 photos) would cost $163 USD. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? That's more than the cost of the ticket to the attraction. When snorkeling in remote areas off the Maui coast, a CD with tons of pics cost maybe $40 which is more what I was expecting this to cost. The quality of the photos they showed us were also mediocre at best. Blinking, poorly timed shots, not what I would expect from pros who do this every day and definitely not the quality of expect if you're going to (LOL) try to charge me more than another ticket price's worth for 12 of the photos. I'd have paid maybe half that price but that's pushing the limit and without question pushing the limit of your typical vacationer's willingness to pay. And it was that, take it or leave it. You can't easily take your own photos (there's no practical vantage point unless you wear a waterproof gopro on your head. They may even prohibit you from taking your own photos. ) Anyway, call me a tourist but is have liked to look back at hanging with the dolphins with my wife. But cmon.

As a group of 4 with some nervous swimmers we chose this Dolphin experience because it was a just the few of us and we could ensure the nervous swimmers felt happy and secure, this is also one of the few places in Rivera Maya that is not cruel to the dolphins and encourages the Dolphin species growth- for this reason we were happy to pay the $170 each for the experience. From the moment we arrived the staff were very friendly and understood that some of our party would need assistance. The dolphin trainer was nice but could came across as a little harsh, especially with one of our swimmers so this put them off doing some of the activities- however she was helpful with our other swimmers in understand their fear of water and how much of a dig deal this was for them.We got to do interact with the dolphins a lot- wave, give them a kiss, etc. For the more sure swimmers we got to try the foot push which was brilliant so this was worth the money we paid.However the negative to this and what takes away from the good work they're doing here is that the photos at the end. We paid just over $260 for all the photos and the video of our activities, this is a steep price but we got a CD & a USB and a print out so we made our piece...however when we got back home there was less than 7 mins of footage and non of it was for good moments such as the footpush. When the chap was talking to us about the various packages, he made out they'd recorded the entire encounter, we were extremely disappointed by this.I would encourage people to use this company though because they are so good to the animals....however to the company, please consider reducing the picture costs...you'll get a lot less negative reviews!"

We arrived by minibus which collected us from hotel. We were given our life jackets and watched a short video which showed activities that we would be doing and some information about the dolphins! Then we headed for the pool. We were lucky to be just the two of us and our trainer. Then she swam towards us!! The beautiful SHEN!(moon in Mexican) wow what can I say she was beautiful. We got into the water with her and we petted her whilst she swam freely around us. Thetrainer was great, I can't remember his name but I gave us so much information about her. She was 6months pregnant. They run a breeding program at the park. We both then got to do a fin swim which entails what it says holding her fin whilst she gently pulls us along. Then the best bit, the superman foot push!! Amazing she and her buddy swam at us and used their noses to push our feet and make us rise out of the water in a superman style pose!!! Great feeling. Even my daughter managed it! We then got to kiss her and make her wave and many other things. All in all a great experience lasting a whole hour!! We purchased the DVD and 1photo but were not pressured to do so, just wanted a lasting memory of a wonderful experience. Highly recommend anyone looking to book to do so ."

Our trainer was Jade and she was out of this world, so friendly and knowledgeable, her relationship with Cab was beautiful to watch and she explained that she works with Cab on a 1 to 1 basis and had been there for 6 years - and you could really tell that the dolphins are very well looked after, in fact all the dolphins there, apart from the Cuban one were born in the maternity centre on site, so they are not just taken from the wild and their homes, just to make money - this was very important to us when choosing who to book with.The whole experience was simply mind blowing, the dolphins are so powerful, yet so gentle and unbelievably intelligent, over 3000 sounds they use to communicate!We had also heard that afterwards there would be a hard sell to put pressure on us to buy photos, however this was not the case we watched some of the dvd and flicked through a few pics and at no time did we feel pressurised - I did by the medium package, which is all the pics and dvd for $275, but its not every day you get to swim with these stunning mammals and to be honest It was a pleasure spending money with a company that was so professional and so caring.Again a BIG thankyou to Jade, she was fantastic and so loving towards Cab x"

One thing that was really important to me was that these animals are looked after, and its clear that they are. The trainers are incredibly well informed they really love and understand the dolphins and the amount of space and freedom they have is fantastic.We paid extra for a couples swim. It's more money but its worth it. When you look at groups of 8 people sharing one dolphin they got way less time with the animal. Because we had one dolphin and trainer to ourselves we had loads more time, could talk to the trainer more and got more intimate with the animal.The tricks are fantastic, the foot push was a really crazy experience. This is a really fun day out.The photos.... wow, the photos. They're good and you get a video, but WOW its expensive. $277 USD for the best package.... the cheapest was still only just under $200 - it's absolutely extortionate. You can haggle, we got about $30 off but thats it.If you will only do dolphin swimming once I guess its worth it for the memories, you cant take your own camera (even a GoPro) so that you have to buy their photos. As I say, good quality but frighteningly expensive. All in all though, a great great day."

We were picked up from our hotel by mini bus which was included in the price and the driver was really pleasant telling us about areas which we passed on the way. We received our life jackets on arrival, watched a short video and were taken in groups to where the dolphins were. We were in a group of 4 and had 2 dolphins between us. They swan around us and we could stroke them, we had water fight with then, they jumped over our heads, kissed our cheek and the foot push was amazing, we were in the pool at least 50 minutes and it was worth every penny. We only bought 1 Photo for $39 dollars, yes very expensive, but you did get a nice wooden frame with it and at the end of the day how often do you the chance to have this experience so had to buy a keepsake. Mini bus collected us and took us back to our hotel. All in all an amazing experience and would recommend."

Omar promptly responded and had me book the Couples Dream Swim for 2 people and a Primax swim for 1 person. He assured me it would be no problem, and he would combine the 3 of us for a custom program. The Delphinus van picked us up at our resort right on time. When we arrived at the check-in window, however, the agent checking us in did not understand that we were doing 3 people on a custom \"couples dream swim.\" The language barrier was difficult, and he finally had to call someone else over to figure out how to register us. It all worked out in the end, and all 3 of us were issued the silver \"dream swim\" bracelets and given t-shirts that were included in the package. We were fitted for our life jackets and watched the required introductory video (short, maybe 5-7 minutes?), then we were taken out to the dolphin tank to meet our trainer and our dolphin. We had a great time, even though my mom and daughter chickened out of doing the foot push and dorsal pull. I loved both activities, though...but had I known they wouldn't do it, I would have done just the (much cheaper) dolphin interaction activity instead of the dream swim. Oh well, live and learn. I only have two complaints. One, the dream swim description led me to believe that it would essentially be a private experience for the 3 of us. While we had our own trainer, we \"shared\" dolphins with other couples doing the same experience and we were all in the same tank. It was hardly private, so again, not sure it was worth the extra price above and beyond the regular dolphin swims. Secondly, the price of the photos. I knew going into it that they were expensive, but I really do not want to pay over $300 for a photo package, when that is nearly as much as we paid for the whole experience! Would I have paid $200 for all 96 photos? Probably. I think if they would just reduce the photo prices by 20 or 30%, they would sell more. Maybe not, maybe others buy them at these ridiculously high prices, I don't know. I still may buy 1 or 2 of the digital photos yet (you can view and purchase online for up to 2 months after your visit). I should also add that the only reason I chose Delphinus over the other dolphin swim companies in the area is because my 4-year-old was eligible to do all the swim/dream swim activities (even though she chose not to). Delphinus' only requirement is height--at least 1 meter tall. The other companies had a minimum age of 5 or 6. Should we do this again when my daughter is older, I would probably go with one of the other companies that includes photos with the package. It seemed like a more reasonable deal, cost-wise."

WE had an option to book as a group of 10 or a group of four, obviously the group of four costs more but for us it was worth it, to get more individual time with the dolphins.We booked via an agent at the hotel who offered a cash back deal, I didn't really understand the point of this, why couldn't they just do at a reduced price? the only reason I could think of afterwards is that it was so difficult to get the cash back that some people would give up, so my advice would be to persevere as we did and eventually got the cash back.(From the agent)As expected photos were not allowed as you had to buy the official photos. This is not such a bad thing as the photos and video are really good and I think it would be more difficult to take your own whilst in the water. The photos are however a bit on the expensive side, but when you consider the set up and what it must cost to maintain I suppose they have to make the money where they can.All of the staff were friendly and helpful.There are showers and changing facilities with towels included.When you arrive,there is a short walk from the bus stop through a wooded area and I would advise you apply some anti mosquito spray, as at the time we went they were very active.The time with the dolphins was a great experience and if I have a chance in the future I would do it again"

He wasn't wrong.We had approx 50 minutes with the dolphins and as a family of 4 we had 1 dolphin to ourselves, except when his friend came to join him for a few tricks! The whole family loved this trip and the trainers were very patient and didn't rush us into doing anything we weren't comfortable with.One of our party was not a confident swimmer at all, and would usually avoid anything like this. Having travelled so far, they decided to give it a try and they are so pleased they did - the best experience of their life is how they described it!At the end, you have the opportunity to purchase photo's. To be fair, these are severely over priced, however we had a cash back deal with our tour operator worth $160USD which really brought the price of the photo's down. Without it, expect to pay around $250+ for a photo package. Towels, lockers and changing facilities are included so don't worry about that - also, everyone wears a life jacket, and there's sizes to fit all.Also, take a soft drink with you for afterwards, otherwise you'll need a small mortgage for the gift shop. Fortunately we were heading back to our all inclusive hotel, otherwise I saw a bag of crisps advertised for 20USD... yes you read that right!"

As we were there 4 of our family of 5 decided to have the experience of swimming with dolphins. We were bustled down to watch a video and swiftly given the number 9 - the number for our group. We were herded into the pool (there were about 12 groups at the same time) with a Spanish speaking family of 3. Our host was friendly but had to provide the info in 2 different languages. The dolphin, Kiara, was beautiful and it was lovely to spend time with her BUT the whole experience seemed rushed and towards the end our host was called to another group and quickly ended our turn. There was a real sense of churning through the guests as quickly as possible and the host even apologised at the end for the fact that the Mexicans are not as good at conservation as the Europeans. We were then channelled into the video / photo room (no photos allowed during the experience & my husband couldn't get any kind of view from the spectator's area) where one of the staff tried to sell us a photo album with video for $400!!!! The cheapest photo was $39 for an 8 x 6 print! Very disappointing all round. The only bonus was that we discovered Puerta Aventuras after - a lovely marina nearby with dolphins, sea lions and manatees in open enclosures and seemingly a much more relaxed environment. We wished we'd gone there. There are so many dolphin experiences along the Yucatan coast and I would definitely recommend doing your homework on this. Even better - go to Holbox and swim with whalesharks - now that really was magical!"

Even doing that, some of us had to stand behind since there was not enough room. Then they barely let you touch or interact at all with the dolphins. Each move was done just long enough for their photographer to get a picture of you doing it, then the dolphin whistle blows, you're done, move away quickly. We did the boogie board thing with them, which was cool, but I would have liked a little more time (then the split second for them to take my picture) to interact a bit. Other groups that probably paid more seemed to get to see the dolphins do tricks, etc. Not our group. At the end, they would like you to buy the pictures for $150 for a cd, or $40/piece. Still a cool experience, but we'll have to just remember it in our heads."

The dolphin experience was absolutely wonderful! We had 45 minutes of time with a dolphin and a trainer. The drawback to this experience came when we wanted to purchase pictures! They will not let you bring your camera into the dolphin area. They have professionals who film the whole interaction and at the end take you into an area where you have the option to purchase pictures and/or a video of the experience. We wanted to really only purchase the video but were not offered that option. We were offered a package which included 12 pictures and a video for $209. Wow....we thought this was very expensive considering the fact we had just paid around $400 for us to experience this interaction with this dolphin. However, we wanted a memory of this event with our child to keep for years to come, so, we purchased the $209 package. We were offered another package which was more expensive, but I can't remember the details right now. When we went and paid which was paid in cash by my husband, we were told we only got 12 pictures. Oh my gosh, was we extremely mad to have learned we just paid $209 for 12 pictures and they kept saying we could not get our money back and that there was no such package for $209 which had the video and 12 pictures. At first, I thought maybe the language barrier was an issue, however, it had nothing to do with a language barrier!!! After my husband stayed and said a few choice curse words, they agreed to give him a flash drive with the video on it after he paid them another $57. The driver was waiting to take us back to the hotel during this process and we were afraid he would leave us with no way to get back. So, we took what they offered. Immediately on arrival to the hotel, we checked to make sure what they said was on the flash drive and it was plus additional pictures we didn't expect. The lesson we learned from this experience is that you never ever pay cash for anything in Mexico!! Also, the dishonesty going on with this photography group at dolphinus is ridiculous! I would never recommend buying pictures from this place. I hope this helps someone else. After we got on the bus back to the hotel, we found out from a british couple riding on the bus with us that they had shown them a package where you could buy just the video for $85. Well, if I would have known that, we could have spent $85 rather than $266 and gotten what we wanted in the first place, but, of course, they never showed us this package!! Please be aware of this scam going on here at dolphinus!!!!!"

But two things marred the experience - first, the Xcaret website where we booked says that a dolphin ride (dorsal fin) is included in the basic option - but it was not. That's disgusting. Secondly, they charged the scandalous price of US$160 extra for a CD containing photographs of the experience, plus 4 printed photos. We were not obliged to buy it, but the viewing area is too far away from the action to get good photos yourself - so if you want a good record of what you did, you feel you have to buy it."

You can't take your own photographs but they are taken for you and, whilst some of the photos were very good they cost far more than they should bearing in mind the cost of the trip in the first place.Nonetheless, if this is something you wish to do whilst in the area then this is likely to be one of the better places to visit. Whilst we weren't told prior to the trip, they even provide fresh towels at the end of your swim. Free lockers are also provided."

We got to do everything we wanted to, and loved our time in the water.Unfortunately, we were so disappointed from there on out. We decided early on that we had to buy all the pictures and videos, because it was such a once in a lifetime experience. I was thinking, \"$100? Maybe $125 max, right?\" When we saw the prices after, our stomachs dropped: $199 for 12 pictures or $254 for all pictures and videos on a CD (there was even a more expensive package, but we didn't even look at it). That is insane. After letting that set in, we bought all of them for $254.After we got home, we pulled up the pictures. Not only were there no pictures of all of us 4 together (to put in our one frame they gave us), but many pictures were out of focus and awkward. The videos were choppy and bumpy. If we're paying $254 for videos and pictures, they better be done PROFESSIONALLY, not by some guy they hired out of high school. It really ruined our entire day.Let me emphasize, swimming with the Dolphins really was fun, but prices are just insane for the quality that you get."

I am sure they have better things to do than interact with the very thing that is destroying their planet. (That's the conservationist bit out of the way) The handlers throw food to keep the dolphins in the immediate area so you can familiarise yourself with it, perhaps a bit of cupboard love, so to speak.Once you can get your head around that and treat the dolphins with the utmost respect they deserve, you will no doubt, like me have one of the most thrilling experiences of your life. At this particular establishment, they have a good thing going for all, it seems. We took advantage of a Couple's Dream Swim Package, which meant my partner and I had plenty of time not only to indulge ourselves with one of the most intelligent creatures on this planet, but also learn more about them. Our dedicated handler was patient and quite obviously so very aware of the personalities of the dolphin(s) we interacted with.Yep, the dolphins knew exactly what to do, they do it day in, day out. But they do say that practice makes perfect, and indeed it was perfect. Our understanding, though I may stand to be corrected, is that a majority of the dolphins in residence were born in captivity, and a lot of research with them goes on at this place. It also appears that the dolphins are allowed to behave naturally in their 'down' time, and although I am not aware of just how many dolphins reside there, they were swapped around regularly, so tiring them was not apparent. One thing was very obvious, dolphins love to play, and I think the biggest problem was stopping them from frolicking around.Just jump in the water, it all seems to come naturally taking into account that there is possibly a couple of dolphins beneath you straight away, just waiting to have a bit of fun. They seem to think it's good karma to just turn up out of the blue and disappear straight away, not even giving you time to be naturally anxious, after all it's not an everyday thing for us humans. Before you know it you're being transported around the pool, courtesy of DOLPHIN POWER!There is resistance from some quarters in society reporting that this sort of environment is not appropriate for the dolphins. I am no expert and I would truly love to engage with these creatures in their ancestral natural habitat, but that just is not going to happen on this scale. If I had thought for one minute that these particular dolphins were distressed or being forced into entertainment, then I would not have visited. I can assure you that there some places in the world that treat these creatures quite badly in captivity, in countries that really should know better.It's not a cheap experience, but it's something that does not come along that often. So start saving for it if you are arranging a holiday in Cancun. I promise you that you will never forget the experience. There is nothing more to add on that score. Just do it!!!Photo's and video are as previously mentioned, cost similar to a second mortgage, however it's also been mentioned the staff may be open to a bit of good old fashioned 'negotiation'. That's what I did and I like to think everybody got something out of the final deal.Questions? Give me a shout, I'm happy to help."

My girlfriend already had this experience several times before, and I wasn't that thrilled to be honest about the enviroment to be around this animals, but we decided to go anyway, she really wanted to have a picture of both with the dolphins.So we asked about a program including a picture of both with a dolphin, we were offered a 20 minutes or 45 minutes of water time with the animals, both with pictures of both, we finally took the 45 min because the waiting time for the van would be even longer so wasn't worth to be waiting doing nothing.We got there around 12:30 and the activities started at 13:30, we were leaving about 15:30. By the time we were swimming with the dolphins (3 groups of 4 with 3-4 dolphins at the same time) we realized we would not be able to take a picture of both with a dolphin or more than one. The trainer said that was forbiden (at least for what we paid), we could only get individual pictures o pictures with our group (4 total, 2 strangers). I asked the guy to talk with his supervisor, we were in the middle of something we didn't wanted or paid for, waiting time of our few days of vacations.After around 15 min (of the total 45) doing nothing in the pool, just the dolphins swimming around while the rest of the groups use the space for activities, we were asked to leave the water with no pictures. We had time for the trainer to talk with his supervisor or even the free photographer took the pictures with one of the dolphins doing nothing. That would have been issue solved for us, just the simple picture of both with a dolphin we asked, and the main motive for the visit.After we were our of the water I asked to talk to the manager or somebody who could solve the issue. They pointed that this kind of thing happened all the time (...) but they could do nothing. Of the pictures taken you can pick:-12 pictures in a CD for USD 150-All the pictures taken and a few printed USD 2xx- and an even more expensive third package.No chance to buy single pictures, we were told.The only solution they offered was for us to buy the USD 2xx package of pictures and they would let us get in the water again to have a pair of pictures of both taken.USD 150 for 12 pictures including the ones offered when we bought the program I would have paid, but after they wanted me to pay even more for I was supposed to be getting from the beginning (And they made it feel like they were doing a favor) I decided to buy none. I will not incentive this kind of, what I call, calculated scam. It is not fare they use your preferences and expectations to squeeze more money out of your pocket, just because you are already at the place and you may never get back.They, after several complaints, offered us to come back again for free, with the condition we took the whole set of pictures, not just the ones missing, so we hopefully bought the most expensive package. Well, I will not waste almost 4 hours of my vacations risking another bad time there.I will never get back. Money lost, and much worst: Time of vacations lost and a day ruined worrying about it.I suggest you consider another place to do this and ask about the specifics more than once. Also just before you start the activities, to make everything very clear."

We have done other swim with dolphins and you are on the ramp in the water where the dolphins swim up to you to give you a kiss. This park you are out swimming when they come up to you to you the kiss. It makes it harder to be stable for all the pictures. You also swim from one side of the area to another side a lot more. This is the first park that they have taken videos of the experience, which turned out very good. We felt the pictures were of great quality compared to some parks. We recommend you buying the photos even if you think they are pricey. This is how they help pay for the staff and to keep place open for us to enjoy we have to pay for the experience one way or another. I did not actually get to swim with the dolphins this time because I was watching my 20 month old granddaughter that was with us to see the dolphins. We were escorted to a visitors area where we could sit and watch the rest of the party swim with the dolphins. It was a little far away to take pictures. We had thought at one time we could tag team it so I could swim but this area was to far away for anyone else to come up and let me go down to swim. I did get to see all the videos and do everything else up to the time they went down to the water. Still a very good time."

The trainers were such dedicated friendly people and although it was the same place we enjoyed it even more the second time round. We booked it through our holiday rep at the hotel. The conservation parts of this facility look and sound great and the video at the start shows much of the work done with dolphins, so knowing your trip helps support dolphins is fantastic. Information on the trips below. In August we did the Silver Package ($169 per person) - This is four people in a group, we got paired with another nice couple and we all enjoyed it very much. Alexa was our dolphin and the trainer and herself were fantastic! You do get a fair amount of petting time and all get a go at doing the tricks and photos in due course. We did purchase the CD with all the photos on but not the video, this was very expensive but we thought as swimming with dolphins is a one off we would get them and it was all great. The photos were fantastic as cost us roughly ($150).In December we did the Couples Dream Swim ($220 per person) - This was just my Girlfriend and I with the dolphin and we got a lot more time with the dolphin itself. We learnt a lot from Sukuun and the wonderful trainer who took a lot of time to help us learn and understand things and also tried to vary the visit as we had been recently. We owe the great visit to the trainers as much as the dolphins. As we got more unique photos and we had more time with the dolphin we also felt inclined to purchase the video and pictures, this cost us about ($210).  This is an expensive extra to add to your holidays but we believe it is something you will remember for a long time and some people dream of this. So honestly, i would budget for the photos etc and splash out this once. As it will bring you back to the great time you had and you can keep them forever. Also helping these wonderful animals and their trainers is definitely worth while. TIP - Take enough cash or you card with you to purchase the photos etc after if you wanted to as you may be caught out by the price (I have given a rough idea on how much). There are lockers to lock your stuff in so nothing will get stolen!  I hope the relevant trainers get the recognition they deserve as i unfortunately cant remember their names but i would 100% recommend this to anyone who goes and also let them know that photos are expensive but personally i believe they are worth it as you are on holiday after all."

            "review": "Amazing experience! But the price of the photos is ridiculous. My boyfriend and I went to Delphinus Riviera Maya last week (February 17, 2015) and it was an absolutely amazing experience. I swam with dolphins once before in the Dominican and was absolutely horrified as to the conditions the animals were kept in - a small, dirty aquarium that smelled like chlorine at a zoo that was not well-kept - and the fact that I had paid $120USD to be rushed in and out of a pool with 10 other people, having only touched a dolphin for about 60 seconds. This was my boyfriend's first time swimming with dolphins, and as I had had such a horrible experience the first time, we decided to go for the better package in hopes that the experience would be better - and it was DEFINITELY worth it!! We did the Primex package (with 4 people) for $170USD per person, as opposed to the next package down which was $120USD with 10 people and I'm SO glad we paid the extra $50USD per person. First and foremost, not only is the facility extremely clean and well-kept, the dolphins themselves are kept in much larger areas and in ocean water so it's a much more natural environment so I felt far more comfortable supporting this facility. In terms of the experience itself, we and another couple were in the water with a dolphin for over 45 minutes. We got kisses, swam with them freely, gave them lots of pets (there's quite a few activities you get to do with them), and then moved to a larger are where a dolphin jumped over us, and took turns pushing us up and out of the water by our feet. If you want an idea as to the activities you do, check out the website and also have a look at photodelphinus.com, and do a search for the Primex photos for a recent day. In addition to the Primex package, we received a promotion through our resort that gave us 25 minutes free for the Sea Trek package, in which you wear a \"scuba helmet\" of sorts and walk on the floor of the \"ocean\" (about 13 feet below surface) where you get to interact with a dolphin with up to 6 people. We lucked out in that we were the only people scheduled that morning so we ended up with 25 minutes with a dolphin to ourselves which was such a cool experience! One thing I will caution, is that while this is entirely safe, I found it really sketchy. I had done something similar before in the Dominican and wouldn't have done it again if it wasn't free. I'm not particularly comfortable under the water like that, and the helmet is really noisey with the air coming in and out of it. It's super heavy and not actually attached to you - it sits on your shoulders and is open so the water essentially comes in to the helmet just under your chin. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for someone that is nervous under the water, and certainly not for a child.With nothing but AMAZING things to say about the facility, the staff, and the entire experience itself, I do have one negative thing to say about the Delphinus experience - the price of the photos on site is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. Having been on several excursions before, I'm aware that photos are not included in the price of your excursion. I'm even aware that they're often expensive. However, after paying $170USD per person - $340USD total - for the excursion itself, I was not at all prepared for the fact that the photo packages STARTED at $240USD!! You could purchase a single photo for $40, but of course as a couple, we didn't have a single photo together so that was $80 for two photos. Even $100 for ALL of our photos would have been ridiculous. So we were extremely disappointed. I'm not sure who came up with their pricing strategy, but it makes absolutely no sense - even charging $100-$150 for the photos would be more reasonable, and a couple like ourselves or even a family with children, would be likely willing to bite the bullet for photos, considering how amazing the experience was. Definitely disappointing. That said, you are still able to purchase your photos online after the experience (not sure for how long after, but ours were still available a week later), and they are a bit cheaper. We ended up taking the hit and purchasing all 110 of our photos for $183USD which is STILL absolutely ridiculous. But at least cheaper than in person.Overall, an AMAZING experience and I would defnitely recommend it. Just expect to drop a pretty penny on photos..."

What I truly enjoyed about this place was that you really do interact with the dolphins and spend time with them in the water! I was in the water with them at least 45 minutes. You are educated about them by the trainers, and the trainers are excellent by the way, then you get to pet the dolphins as they swim around you. You will also get pushed inn the water by the dolphins! You lie on a boggy board, the dolphin then comes and pushes you through the water by pushing your feet! You also get to kiss the dolphin and get kissed by the dolphin. Some have criticized this place about the price of photos. There is some truth here. The photos are expensive. I spent 130 for a memory stick with all the pictures their staff took of me , printed picture with frame and a DVD of the session, you are being recorded at all times. However, this place is a dolphin habitat as well as tourist attraction. The money is used to care for and save these wonderful creatures. That being the case, I can live with being extorted on the price of the pictures a bit. If you go the experience and memories will last a lifetime. I would strongly recommend it, and lets face it, any other dolphin encounter will charge you just as much for the pictures."

The activity was great! They had photographers taking photos and once the swim was over, we had the option to purchase the photos. I brought $50 cash and thought that this would be more than enough to get a cd of our photos. It turned out that they were charging $35 for 1 picture! If you wanted all of your photos on a disc, it was $200+. This put such a bad taste in our mouth after such a great experience. The excursion itself was very pricey ($310 for both of us) but then they tried to charge astronomical amount to get the pictures. Unfortunately we didn't bring enough money to have the option to get our photos but even if we did, I would not pay that much for a few pictures....very unfortunate."

My sister didn't go in but the rest of us did and had a really good time. My sister was a little upset that she had to watch from so far away and I understand that it's a safety issue but we had our backs to her the whole time so she didn't really see much. It would have been nice if she could have been a little closer or since they knew we had family watching, maybe we could have at least faced her?The staff was really nice and when the 4 year old was too scared to do the feet push they found something else for him to do so he didn't feel left out...he got to feed a dolphin and take a picture sitting next to one. All in all it was an excellent and unique experience. While a bit pricey for the pictures, there were some that came out very well and since we got them on a USB stick, we were able to share between the family and make our own prints."

My true heartbreak is that we did not get any pictures. Way overpriced. You could get one printed with a frame for $39.99 USD. Or we could get 10 pictures for $298.00 USD. And I don't even remember the price for all the pictures, and there was video. I am sorry but after paying the large amount of money we did for the expierence you would think they would make the photos a little more affordable. I get that they want to make money to help support a great place like this, but you certainly are not going to sell many photos with prices like that.

We booked the silver package which was up to four people however it just ended up being myself and my partner which was perfect. I have to admit I was really wary of doing this as I am against animal cruelty but after researching the park I decided this would be a good place to try this once in a lifetime experience. Im also really scared of going into the water, I cant go into the sea! However, once you are there and see the beautiful dolphins you forget all about it. We started with Xel-Ha and the trainer Debbie. She was absolutely fantastic and you could tell she cared for the dolphins, and they absolutely adored her! We had some free time with our dolphin swimming around us, then we learnt some commands, got splashed in the face a few times and got the chance to feed her. We were joined by a second dolphin who (I cant remember his name) again was lovely and clearly well looked after. Both myself and my partner got the foot push which was just amazing!! After this we got some more time learning commands, and we were joined by Emmanuel as Debbie had to leave. After some more free time with the dolphins we also got pulled along the water by the dolphins which again was amazing! At first I was hesitant to do this as I was scared it would hurt the dolphins but after interacting with them you could feel how strong they were and how much they enjoyed being in the water with people. At the end of our swim, Emmanuel explained to us the importance of looking after our wildlife and how to be more careful in future to protect them. You could tell both trainers were very passionate about the animals and really cared for them which was lovely to see. At the time of booking the excursion we asked our rep how much the photos were going to cost, so we could save the money for the trip. We bought all the photos and the video and I dont grudge a single penny. We saved loads of money to take on holiday as we knew we wanted to do this kind of stuff, so we knew to expect it. I do think its alot to spend but hopefully it goes towards looking after the dolphins. Overall I would 100% recommend this excursion, and I would definitely do it again. It was absolutely amazing and i'm so glad I actually done it! But I would definitely recommend doing your research before doing dolphin swims, there are a lot of parks out there that mistreat these poor animals and they don't deserve your money.Thank you Delphinus for the best experience of my entire holiday!"

There is an agreement with Thomson that if you book the silver swim with Delphinus, there will be just 4 people to the group which is a lot less that usual - this is what drew us to the trip. When in the water with the Dolphins it was just my boyfriend and I and we were in the water for over an hour. We were able to perform commands with the Dolphins which was both educational and fun, get up and close to them as they swam around us and receive kisses off them. Two Dolphins perform the foot push when you are pushed through the water at a high speed which was amazing! There is so much stuff packed into the session that you really get your money's worth and you can tell the trainers care about the Dolphins. We were also aloud to assist with putting eye drops in the Dolphins eyes and feel inside of their mouths. The thing that really stuck out for me is how much the trainers at Delphinus are devoted to the care and welfare of the Dolphins - they gave a talk on how you shouldn't support places who take Dolphins from the wild - as they haven't taken any Dolphins from the wild in over 15 years, with all of their Dolphins being bred in their facilities.Overall it was the most amazing experience and well worth the money!"

If you are a couple I would definitely pay the little bit extra and get the dolphins to yourselves rather than be part of a big group. The trainers are friendly, teach you a fair bit and you can tell they care about the dolphins.What I found very annoying was the experience once you got out of the water. This is nothing to do with the expensive photos either, we knew this already and bought just one for 39 USD (I personally do not know what I would do with a DVD and 200 photos once I got home - after parting with 300 USD for it too). The computers crashed as we were looking at our photos (no problem - these things happen). But once they were back up and running we were looking at the ones we had not seen when we were approached by a member of staff who's exact words were \"sorry I don't want to be annoying but can you rush through them.\" This was because the next group were ready to come and look at theirs - I could understand if we were taking all day to look through them but we had only spent 5/10 minutes at most. After the money we had spent you would expect better.Then on the way home we were given the nastiest look when we did not tip the driver (we gave quite a generous tip on the way and assumed we would have the same driver taking us back, plus we had just spent our last dollars on the photo and some snacks). This let the whole thing down, we had just spent +400 USD with this organisation and our last memory is their driver looking at us with disgust because we did not part with even more cash. He had a sign up in the van saying \"I do not get a salary, only the tips.\" I'm sorry but this is not my problem; the package stated 'includes round trip transportation' so this is something the company needs to address. Rather than trying to eek out every last penny perhaps the focus should be more on the customer experience. I would go with another company if you are planning on a dolphin swim, there are plenty about (although probably owned by the same people so what do they care!)"

Apparently money can buy such things...as apparent by the title!We booked Delphinus as it is endorsed by Thomson due to 'issues' with the local Dolphin experiences. Rightly so as it turned out.We were collected about 90 minutes before her swim began and arrived an hour before. As designated observer for the party there was a very nice viewing area with a good view of the lagoon at Delphinus. The lagoon is man made but directly connected to the sea so looks a really natural arena. I had the opportunity to watch the Dolphins at play before the designated dolphin swimmer entered the arena. It has to be said that as a value for money trip the Silver package certainly fits the bill as you have an hour in the water with these brilliant animals and in a far smaller group (4) than previous 'once in a lifetime' experiences.The Dolphins look happy interacting with people and perform some really nice tricks up close and personal with their audience. I would say that the jump the Dolphin does over the group looked the best but my wife said that the 'foot push' was her favourite part of the swim. It looked brilliant all through and I have to say that if we are lucky enough to go back I would like to do this as a couple. Delphinus offer a couples swim experience.After the swim was over, we were taken upstairs to view the many photos taken as well as buy other momentos of the interaction with the Dolphins. We spent a few quid on them but was happy to do this as they provide a great souvenir.Apparently swimming with Dolphins is a 'once in a lifetime' pastime a bit like playing golf, to me as an observer it looked pretty amazing.

I did not expect them to be cheap, but during the experience I thought to myself \"I am going to buy these pictures and video even if it's $100 USD\"; I was shocked to find out they were $260 USD for 12 pictures and the video. That was way beyond my budget, that is almost half of my wedding picture fee and those included 90 digital pictures and the rights to them. I ended up with only one picture for $40 USD. I wish I could have more pictures to remember it by and show my family, but the experience itself was still completely worth it."

They offered to pick up the ones having the experience and 2 other people accompanying for free which was nice. We got CHEAPER TICKETS in the website \"groupon mexico\".When we got to the place i felt was disorganized, no one accompanied us to where we were supposed to go, so we got to the 15 min explanation previous to the swim late and they were totally rushing it. After we were assigned to a group and when we got to the water we were told that was not our group, so we were directed back and forward. Once in the water, there were a lot of sludge, but it might be normal. In the same pond there were at least 6 groups, now imagine, all groups having a staff member shouting directions to the dolphins and you... its stressful. that made me think about the dolphins doing that all day and i just imagined how stressful is. the little contact you get with the dolphin is mainly for the pictures where you pay aprox 40UDS for one single picture not even digital. For that you have to pay over 150USD if i remember correctly. If you want to have an experience with dolphins make sure you research about places first!"

Where we had 60 mins in the water, but found for the last 15 mins all they done was clock watch and mostly just get the dolphin swim around us. We were a little disappointed at the end because we had 2 other dolphins join us which were jumping over us and giving us displays, none of this got photographed as our photographer disappeared half way through. We also found our dolphin had to keep being borrowed for another groups for foot pushes. For the price we expected as clearly stated we expected to get a dolphin to ourselves for a whole 60 minutes. We were told that we would get 2 footpushes. We asked for our second and we were refused, even though we were the only ones left In the water. We have some good photos but of the all the activities, but the way they market them is a rip off. Our DVD is 11 minutes long. 6 of which were our dolphin just swimming around us. Really we only got 15 minutes on our own. The other 45 minutes were shared with other groups - even though we paid for the couples dream swim.You have to take the second package to get all your pictures which also includes the DVD and a picture printed off by them. We personally wouldn't have got the DVD. This package cost $252.00 usd. When you actually get home and look at the pics you find lots of them are repeats. So it appears you are getting more for you money. I did however enjoy spending time with the dolphins. The footpush is great as is some of the other activities. But all in all a little disappointed and rip."

When we checked the website back at the hotel we could view all our photos from the day and could purchase up to 12 for 43 US dollars. A big difference in what we paid on the day for the CD from the park!

We researched the different companies in the Riviera Maya and concluded that this was probably one of the best. So the kids had a great time and they'll be able to say they swam with dolphins and had the dolphins push them through the water and they petted them etc. etc. However, I felt that we were exploited and I am concerned that the dolphins are as well.You will see other reviews mentioning the price of the photos. They're all accurate and you feel completely ripped off after the fun event. $240 for 20 photos or $280 for the \"most popular\" package. For photos, for Pete's sake! Let's face it, if you're going to have a unique, once in a lifetime experience, you're going to want to have some evidence of it. They know they have a captive audience and they gouge you in an unconscionable way. There would be pricing policies they could adopt which would not make you feel ripped off in this way and would enable you to walk away feeling that you'd had an all-round great experience.At the same time, you're not the only one being exploited. I have to say that the space allotted to the dolphins made the experience for me at least a very uncomfortable one. The dolphins are kept 24 hours a day with 6 of them in a space about 100m long by 25m wide in water that is 13m deep. These animals in nature are used to swimming 10s of km a day, so the space they are provided seems very limited. I asked the trainers about whether they are given more space at night but I was informed that they are not. I could provide more commentary on this, but that would not meet tripadvisor guidelines. If you would like to know more about this, please contact me."

We were taken into a room to look at the video and pictures and they were all awesome. We loved them. I wanted to buy them all Then the lady pulls up the price... What?!?!?! $285 for pictures ?!?!? Are you kidding, I have never heard of something that ridiculous. To make it worse if I wanted to buy 1 of each kid they charged me $39 a piece per picture. I had bought previous pictures at excursions and also at the hotels and none of the other ones charge even close to this. I ended up not buying any which is really sad because you can't bring a camera or video of your own so now we had this amazing time (which mind you I had spent $750 for the 5 of us to go) and we have no pictures to show for it. I think this is terrible operating practice and will never return or recommend anyone to do this excursion because they really take advantage of you not being able to bring your camera.

The arrival process was fine, a short safety video as you would expect. Then we were straight into the water. The dolphins were so well trained and intelligent, they really seemed to be enjoying it. You get to touch them and interact with them which is fascinating. The foot push was definitely the highlight - absolutely brilliant. The sheer size and power ofthe dolphins is staggering, but they are incredibly friendly and gentle. There was another couple in the pool with us but we hardly noticed them at all.Tip: don't even try and take your own camera unless you have someone in the group who's just spectating. Firstly they don't allow it and secondly there's no way you could manage to hold it in your hand whilst doing the different activities with the dolphins.I have to echo previous reviews on the pricing of the photos. Delphinus seem like a really responsible company with regard to the dolphins but they are completely mercenary with the pictures. I know it's a business and they have to make as much money as possible but they are scumbags with the pricing. We did buy two of the printed pictures which are fantastic and glad we got them but we just could not justify paying hundreds of pounds for the video and all of the pics. This is the only reason I haven't given 5 stars. Overall we found it to be a brilliant and unforgettable experience, once in a lifetime.

            "review": "Highlight of my Mexico vacation!!!. My husband and I swam with the dolphins May 16th and participated in the couples dream swim which was worth every penny. We got an hour in the water, which i think we stayed in longer, with one but mostly two dolphins. The first dolphin we had ended up with another couple as she favored their trainer and being closer to the pool with boy dolphins as it was mating season, which we learned a lot about during our session. Due to this, and I can't even call it an inconvenience, we were able to see that the trainers didn't force the dolphins to do anything they didn't want to and how much they really care about them. A new dolphin immediately came over and we continued with our experience. Our trainer was excellent and very informative and defiantly helped ease the nervousness as this was our first time swimming with dolphins. She was very friendly and helped make this experience awesome!!  Although people complain about to there being way to many photo opportunities I feel the opposite. While there was a few times we were asked to look at the camera and smile, which would have been the same if my mother was taking the pictures and probably more often, it wasn't constant and for sure didn't consume a lot of time, we actually had more free swim time with our dolphins than photo opportunities and anyway who wants a picture without a smile when getting that kiss!!!!  Before we went I had done my homework and researched and read many reviews to prepare myself as to what to expect and how much the extras would cost, from reading previous reviews I honestly thought buying the pictures was going to be worse than it actually was. The people were not pushy and didn't even try to sell us anything. We bought one picture with both of us in it for $40 that also included a souvenir picture frame that says Delphinus riviera maya on it, which I thought was great.  I wouldn't read to much into to negative comments about this place some people try and find anything to complain about instead of enjoying the experience. When your dealing with intelligent animals like dolphins not everything will go as excepted and the trainers know this as well as they try and fix whatever issues arise quickly.  I would for sure swim with Delphinus again in a heart beat and recommend them to anyone that wants to swim with the dolphins ! "

As part of the Living Social voucher we had for an all inclusive vacation at the Reef Playacar, we also enjoyed a 50% discount for Delphinus Riviera Maya. It was a wonderful experience to swim with the dolphins. The dolphins seem well cared for and it was amazing to experience first hand their intelligence and willingness to interact with us. We had kisses, a little dance, and had the fantastic experience of being pushed up out of the water by two dolphins. It was so amazing that we decided to buy the photos and the video. Unfortunately the prices for both the photo and the video are extortionate!! It's a shame as it leaves a bitter taste of having to pay so much to remember a once in a lifetime experience, but I guess that's how they can get away with it. However, nicely managed place and highly recommended swimming with dolphins. We did the Primax 4 swim which means we joined up with another couple. It was fun and all got chance to interact with the dolphins individually."

Not sure if i was going to be able to even though booked up aa friend had been burnt badly but luckily we managed to go. We had shona the 1st born in captivity the other dolphin didnt want to play but this did not stop the amazing time we had from the wave, kiss, cuddle, jump over, dancing, playing, singing and of course the foot push. Dolphina are inteligent animals and kept circulating my friend who was burnt an turning over showing her stomach when not asked to do so our trainer said a while back shona was next to a lady she was asked if she was pregnant the lady said no but sure enough a month later delphinius received a letter saying she had been pregnant at the time an the dolphin knew this. Shona picked up my friend had not been well and was protecting them (the trainer did not know my friend had been unwell till after the swim) the downside is a group of 4 of us but we wanted seprate photos as 2 lots of 2 the photographer did not fully understand obviously so no photos of my friend n me together the photoa are very expensive and as i did not have much money we asked for a slight discount 100 dollars we were plainly told \"no\" so we came away with no pictures of the day i dont know why they have to charge so much and you should get 1 at least included in the peice. A good day but wish we had a photo as a keep sake"

My husband and I did the Couples Dream Swim on May 13th 2014, I had booked this 3 months in advance online as we were on honeymoon and really wanted to do this experience of a lifetime.Getting there was no problem, timely pick up at our hotel lobby and the driver was pleasant and courteous. Had the safety video etc and then we were taken to a smaller pool and met our dolphin. She was an absolute joy to behold and I was very nervous initially as I'm not good in deep water (but found that the water is only 13ft deep). Our dolphin was a 3yr old and wasn't able to do the foot push so we got another one (their names escape me as our trainer was a bit of a grump and a bit bossy). The whole experience was tainted for me as it was just one photo opportunity after the other, they made the dolphin repeat certain behaviours like the kiss etc. It really annoyed me that we weren't able to use our own camera, I didn't realise this until we had arrived. We didn't carry any cash or cards with us (didn't think we would need to) so were unable to buy any photos.A week after returning home I emailed the company asking if they could help us out with buying some photos, and received a reply a few days later informing me they would certainly do so. 3 weeks later, I am still waiting. I have emailed twice since asking if they are going to allow me to buy my photos, but no reply. I am very disappointed with the customer service of this company. The dolphins are amazing creatures, but the people who run this attraction should treat the customers better. I am gutted that I have no photos of what was a magical experience."

It's also a little hard to find if you are driving there. It took me at least 25 minutes when I was in the area. The signs make no sense and are extremely confusing. We did the underwater head thing and a swim and pull. Cost us about $308 for both. It was great. I hate that all these dolphin places are focused more on taking your picture and having you pose for most of the time you are participating in the activities. Cheapest picture you will get is 1 for $40 USD. ANything else will run you $119-$300 USD. CRazy I know. And they just have a GoPro hero 3 for the underwater pictures. None of these dolphins places let you take your own camera. The rip off comes at the end when they want you to buy the pictures. Tourists will be tourists and want to have an everlasting memory of it so they will always make money doing this. We had a dice that started at 2:30. They came to talk to us about it till 2:40 then we waited there for another 15 minutes while they prepared the activity. I thought it was a waste of time. You should have these things ready to go instead of wasting my time by making me wait. The swim was better. A video and explanation of what we are going to do. No waiting there. All in all it's just like every other dolphin activity. Everyone was really nice and helpful including the staff. There are parrots hanging around outside that you can look at up close. No touching because they bite."

I went here in May 2014 on my Honeymoon.On arrival only one of the check in booths were open, there were 3 girls in front of us who were faffing to pay and in total took us 20 minutes to even get in.We were told to go down to the changing area and then would be called. On going down there the changing area was vile, dirty and unpleasant, this needs improving on! When you have finished your experience there is no way to shower properly and you just have to put your clothes back on soaking wet and with sea water over you.There is also no food facility we went over a late lunchtime and on finishing I really needed some food, all there was were crisps and chocolate. The actual experience however was amazing. We were in a group of 4 and the dolphin was lovely, she was very well looked after and well behaved, trained very well! We had all of the photos like kiss and dance, shake and the foot push which was fab. Ladies were a 1 piece not a bikini other girls in my group lost their bottoms. Photos are extortionate as we would not be doing anything like it again we bought the photos and the DVD that was nearly $300!!Great experience but would not go back due to the facilities."

I have to say it was one of the most brilliant experiences I have ever done! We spent an hour in the pool after a 15 minute discussion with a trainer, who presented us fluently in English, Spanish and French. Jade spoke excellent English and is really good with the Dolphins. Our first Dolphin Chen wanted to be with her friend, not us, so that's where Pilko came in! Particularly the footpush was our favourite! Everything ran smoothly with the transfers to and from the hotel. This was despite the fact that my sister had booked this from the UK in secret to surprise us for a wedding present (I think she had more difficulty than us in fairness). We each received a free T shirt as a memento of our day. Photos - are expensive but worth it - around \u00a3150. We got 111 pictures for this. Quality is great. We also purchased the DVD which is also good quality. We actually had an issue with the memory card with all the pictures on- it was stolen from the hotel which we were gutted about. I contacted Delphinus as soon as we realised and they were able to send us the pictures on an email - they were very speedy and helpful with the matter and we cannot fault them. We would highly recommend Delphinus!"

Luckily when we arrived in Mexico everyone was recommending Delphinius as they aren\u2019t in an unnatural habitat and the dolphins are rescued and bread within the attraction.We was impressed by the beautiful grounds but were a bit lost what to do before we started. There was an intro of some sort on the telly in the communal area but it had already started and was very quiet. The mentor then gave us a full safety intro and fitted us for life jackets. When we was assigned our trainer we went down to the water and met Pacal and Kak the dolphins who were both very cheeky. Within the deal we were scheduled to have a nose push, dance, kisses, jump over and our own two dolphins and private treatment. I was slightly disappointed that we shared the same water area with another couple, although we had enough space it wasn\u2019t as private as I imagined and at times such as their nose push they used one of our dolphins. However the hour overall was great fun. Photos are extortionately expensive so we bought one."

It was one of our best experinces. You can really see that the dolphins are well cared for and are very much loved by their keepers. We had free time with dolphins swimming around us and we could pet them. Then there was some posing for pictures such as you kissing dolphin, dolphin kissing you and holding dolphin fins. You then do some activities such as get the dolphin to dance, sing and splash water with his nose and tail. then you all link arms and dolphins jump over you and finish off with a dolphin push which is an amazing activity. I couldnt do it but the trainers did not let me give up and were not satisfied until i did it, they were very encouraging which is good cos i had 3 attempts and nearly lost my bikini bottoms while doing it lol. Towels, lockers, transportation and a souvenier t-shirt are provided. We purchased the pictures because we new prices in advance and had no problems with paying as it was a once in a life time experience. They grouped the pictures of just me and my bf as we did not know the other couple. The prices were $155 for 12 pictures of your choice, $197 for all the pictures on USB (We had 68 pictures all of good quality) and a DVD with your video which is 13 minutes long. And for $287 you could have DVD,USB and a book with some printed pictures. I would most definately recommend this company and trip to anyone. We had the most amazing time. Thank you Delphinus :-)"

The price was about $200 USD. The experience in the Bahamas was literally more of a free swim, I was diving with the dolphins and although there were 4 of us in total I pretty much had a dolphin to myself. The complete free interaction was incredible. The pictures were about $80USD (if I remember correctly) for a couple of pictures (which I did buy), but the trainer took my camera and took pictures with my camera for me as well.The delphinus dolphin experience (Primax 4) was quite different. I was a little disappointed with the \"free swim\". The free swim is really just you standing still a small distance away from the others, and the dolphin swims between and around the 4 people for about 10 minutes in total. What was unique for me was that a few times when the dolphin reached me it would roll over so I could pat it's belly, the trainer said that meant she liked me, so I thought that was a neat experience. The foot push was incredible, but the pictures have to be the least flattering thing I have ever seen (my squished head created a double chin). This dolphin experience is really just a dolphin doing tricks that involves some people, but still an amazing experience.Another good thing about this location was that my boyfriend was able to spectate at no cost, and they put my in a \"pool\" that had a closer spectator area so he could take pictures of me. The only negative to this was that sometimes I was facing the other direction (they did this on purpose I think so that they would have the best photos of me, which makes perfect business sense, so can't fault them for that).As a couple others said, once we got there, there was a bit of waiting to do, but I just watched the dolphins with the other people and the waiting area was covered so we weren't directly under the sun which was good.And as all the others said, the pictures are a ridiculous price (of course I'm a photo-a-holic so I bought them). I bought the $143 package, which was all the pictures on a USB stick and the video, now that I've purchased it I definitely question whether I should have spent that much or not, but oh well can't change it now!"

The primax 4 was not cheap in the first place, would one photo together have hurt? The girl ended up leaving the pool in tears. The dolphins have red raw looking mouth areas, we were concerned this is due to the endless foot pushes they do. But they seemed well cared for on the whole and the enclosures were of reasonable sizes. The photos were absolutely extortionate, prepare to remortgage your house!!"

We were all supplied with life jackets, so that was not an issue. The dolphins were charming, gentle and they did exactly what they were supposed to do. We got upgraded with our package because of the group that we were with. Therefore we actually got a ride by holding on to the dolphin's dorsal fin as it pulled each of us across the pool. There were staff members taking our pictures and making videos of the swim. The photo packages were a bit pricey, but we did buy them. They got some great pictures!I'm always concerned for the treatment of animals, and it seemed that the dolphins were treated well. I very much enjoyed \"swimming with the dolphins\"."

We booked through out Thomson rep and the price was high but included $40 cash back which made it more affordable. It's something you HAVE to do, a truly amazing experience BUT be aware of the costs. When it came to purchasing pictures we could not justify the price and when we considered the fact we'd rarely look at them we just decided to take the memories home. The hour passes quickly but the best bits for or us were when the dolphin just swims around and you get to stroke them, they're so lovely. If you get the chance then do it, I'd recommend it to anyone but just be ready for what it might cost, the all in package for photos was unreal!"

            "review": "Best Paid Dolphins on The Planet!. My family of four made an excursion to Delphinus Riviera Maya after our Sunquest agent at the hotel recommended it. The visit was for my wife and two daughters, I opted out to be paparazzo for the trip and was allowed to go for free. We chose the Primax 4 (max 4 people/dolphin) package because they had a special offer of $40 rebate per person after the excursion. After a quick ride in the van, the girls suited up and watched the intro video for about 10 minutes. They went to the pool area and were matched with a trainer and dolphin for just the 3 of them. Spectators watched from a view area above the pools. They got to learn about, touch, feed and play with the dolphin. The trainer made the dolphin jump over them and the highlight was the foot push where 2 dolphins push on your feet to lift you up and push you through the water. They had a lot of fun. I'd like to say it was worth it, but the excursion was over $500 USD and the photos and video package (USB & DVD) cost another $250 USD. It was a very expensive afternoon, so for most people this is best left as a once in a lifetime experience. If you can bear to part with that kind of cash, it will be a very exciting and memorable part of your vacation."

Met up with Emmanuel AKA Antonio Banderas who was a great host. He explained everything clearly from what the dolphin would do to what we were supposed to do. It was a joy to see my wife's face change from initial trepidation to one of sheer joy. The dolphins are so gentle and the foot push and the dorsal pull was such a rush. Personally the interaction with the dolphins was worth every penny as the memories will stay with me and my wife forever. It's a shame that memories are all we will have as like a host of others on this site I was not prepared to be fleeced and pay an extortionate amount of money for the photo / CD package. Even a single photo would have cost in the region of \u00a335. Will you not learn that if you put your dearest package down to $100 then many more people would buy at that price and you would still make a healthy profit from something that would cost $10 to make. Great experience shame about the attempted profiteering. Go Banderas"

They have huge pools to swim in and the dolphins are clearly loved and treated well by the trainers.We went for the Dolphin Primax option, there was a total of 4 people in our group with 1 dolphin between 2. We got to stroke the dolphins, have a water fight with them and perform the foot push (2 dolphins lift you up and out of the water by pressing their nose on the balls of your feet). They even sang happy birthday to one of us and we learnt a lot about them. Be warned: The excursion is extremely Expensive!! I ended up needing to use the credit card.We spent $150 per person for 45mins swim with dolphins ($40 Refundable which was a deal at the time) then a further $150 on pictures and video. You are not allowed to take your own camera into the dolphin pool, of course this is a ploy to get you to by there photos at an extortionate cost $150 for USB stick of photos and DVD or $40 per print. When I got the files home the DVD quality was terrible and had techno style music as a backing track, this meant there was no audio from the dolphins or us. Also the picture files were only 2MB each, thus meaning if you wanted to blow these pictures up larger than A4 they would quickly lose quality which was rather disappointing.All in all we spent in excess of $350 ($175 each) for about a 2hr excursion that was with an $80 reduction discount, too much in my opinion. That being said we had a fantastic time."

The activity is perfect but the only negative point was the price of the picture, there's no sense why they are such expensive (like 4 pictures for 160$ US). That's really sad for people who doesn't have a lot of money, the price of the excursion is already expensive so they don't buy their pictures at end. The second things that we dislike was when we wanted to pay our picture they told us that they accept visa card but we tried with 3 visa cards and it didn't work so we told them that the problem was not our card but their machine but they were laughing at us and they said that it was not their machine. So they didn't offert us a discount even if we delayed our driver. Finally to be able to get our picture we paid them to bring us at the starbuck coffee and then we paid the picture plus the delivery price in cash. So don't use visa card because it doesn't work, employe laught at you and then you delay the driver who won't be happy after! In general, the activity was great but really expensive!"

We felt they were must have momentos of this amazing experience. This was the second time my parents have done this and even though both experiences were excellent, they felt delphenius had a slight edge over their first dolphin encounter. There is more than one group in the pool at any given time.So there are multiple dolphins that you get to meet. You get to see the different personalities. And the different personalities help you appreciate how truly amazing these creatures are. We were the first visitors of the day and got to watch the dolphins play on their own before we got in the water.They had us laughing before we even got wet!!Truly amazing.

Me & my boyfriend did this together, we had a trainer and a seperate lagoon to our self, and had a dolphin each!! I think this was down to the fact that not many tourists spoke english so i presume it was easier for the trainers to keep each language groups together as some groups had up to 8 in them. Lucky us! In total we spent about 1 hour with the dolphins, touching, kissing, dancing, hugging, singing and the famous foot push that was an unforgettable experience. There is a camera man recording all this - available to buy at the end. We did not purchase the video. We did buy 2 pictures which were prices at $29USD each, a little bit pricey considering what you pay for the trip. However, a great way to remember the memory."

You guys would deserve all the tips but unfortunately the photos made me broke!!! Also it was amazing being able to take part in a training session when there was no other people around and having a go on the bogie boards.I can not tell you enough how amazing these animals are and how special the staff made out day even if the photos are a little steep on the price!Now just one thing to pass on First choice are bad bad bad!!!I specially went to first choice in the uk and checked trainer for a day was ok for a 5 yr old..... Oh yes of course we can book it two adults one child booked and paid before we leave the uk!Get to Mexico see a delphinus brochure with the website have a little look as I wanted to know a bit more and on the web site it says no children under 13 allowed!!!!Well..... I've promised a 5 year old for 2 weeks he can swim with dolphins marching time to the rep! He calls oh no you can't go!!! But we can book you on another programme... Ok I agree... Then I'm told you booked it in the uk so we can only refund you there and if you want another program you have to pay..... Ok so toys go out of the pram tantrum time from me....half hour later after tears of how am I going to tell a 5 year old he can't see the dolphins.... The rep calls again and as a special we can go and do the trainer for a day!!!!! Furious with first choice!!On speaking with staff at delphinus it would appear that first choice do not make a decent attempt to find out about the programs provided... I would contact delphinus direct they are lovely and will give you all the advice you need :-) thanks again to everyone at delphinus Ps it would be lovely if you could reply with a list of names of all the dolphins so I can remind my son of the ones we can not remember."

The swim itself was an hour and to be fair the trainer assigned to our party of four was very knowledgable and welcoming. Our dolphin performed well and for myself this is where it all begun to feel like he was a circus performer and left me feeling very uncomfortable and sad. By the end I was sorry I had done this trip.Photo's which had been taken for the hour were for sale at the end for a grand total of $299 American Dollars about \u00a3160.00 which I felt was way too expensive, especially for families who would want a momentum of their experience. I must add that there were other photo packages, but I was trying to come to terms with the cost of this package and can't remember the price.Transport back to the hotel. Well, all the buses disappeared and we were left waiting for 30 mins. One eventually arrived and we got back despite the bus smelling of petrol. Again driver asked for a tip, this appears to be normal practice, which he was given courteously from an American traveller.Not a bad trip but certainly not the most enjoyable experience of my Mexico holiday."

We had a fantastic experience in our 1 hour Primax 4 swim with the dolphins - the final superman foot push was fantastic to do and great to watch my friends and family do it. However, like so many reviews here, the cost of the photo DVD seems expensive. Our party consisted of two families, a total of 9 people, who we travelled to Mexico with, and the cost of the DVD was 320 USD. When I asked why it was so expensive I was told this is because they can only accommodate a small number of people each day and need to price the pictures at that level to fund the experience. I wonder if they might be better lowering the prices and then more people would buy the photos / DVDs generating the same amount of revenue or even charging slightly more for the entry fee and lowering the photo prices. This would certainly improve their Trip Advisor ratings although they must know best how to run their business.One other point was that we got a bargain on the cost of the experience. We paid $110 per person rather than $149 via our holiday rep by booking at a place on 5th Avenue in Playa del Carmen and we got other trips, e.g. Whales Sharks and Coba/Tulum, much cheaper than by booking in our hotel as well."

Pick up was prompt at hotel lobby and we were taken straight to Delphinus and dropped back at hotel lobby at end of day.

Trainer was extremely friendly and put you at ease immediately. Was very impressed with the dolphin's environment as they are in natural sea water and not a pool, and dolphins seemed very happy and well cared for. Experience overall was fantastic - memories to cherish forever!! One disappointing aspect of experience though....we ordered the photo book (photo souvenirs are VERY expensive but our rep had prepared us for this and to be honest we were willing to pay for the experience) which was $189 and were assured it would be delivered to our hotel the very next day between 9am and 10am (my boyfriend confirmed his with the salesman as we were due to go home 3 days later). Unfortunately it did not appear on the promised day (no message was left for us with hotel reception to explain why) and it was only by involving our First Choice holiday rep that we managed to get it before we left...albeit 3 hours before our coach arrived to take us to airport. Only negative memory of an otherwise amazingly unforgettable experience!"

We booked the silver experience with our Thomson Rep.We got 75 mins in the water with another couple we hadn't met before - so four people to one dolphin and instructor.The team make you feel very comfortable and nothing is too much trouble. The experience in the water with the dolphin was brilliant. You get plenty of time as an individual, couple and as a group of four to experience the swim. Our package included transport to and from our hotel in Playacar. The courtesy bus was on time and the driver met us again in the car park after the swim.You are not allowed to take your own photos, someone takes photos and a video. They are not cheap to buy, but we got 57 photos of us on a USB stick and a dvd film of our experience for 120 English pounds. It was the cheapest package and seemed enough to pay. The quality of the photos was excellent and worth the money we paid.An experience we will never forget. Thanks Delphinus!"

Loads of interaction with the dolphins. Foot push, kiss, hug etc. Didn't stop smiling and were in awe at these incredible creatures. They take loads of pictures and video footage of you with the dolphins but beware they are very expensive. Individual pictures US$29 each, with packages from US$180 to US$260. A lot yes, and lets face it, everybody wants a memory of their experience. The whole experience was more than we expected, even with the money back voucher, but it was worth every penny.

My Husband and I did the Primax 4 dolphin experience and I have to acknowledge that although there are only 4 in your group you are not the only group in the water at the same time and this can get a little busy. The price may also put a few people off however I would say it was worth every penny. We didn't buy the DVD at the end or the slideshow of photos and these are expensive based on what has already been paid but we did get 2 photos. Highly recommended just a few things to bare in mind."

We had one of the head trainers, along with two dolphins just for the two of us for an hour. We each did two foot pushes, had both dolphins jump over us, hugged them, danced with them, kissed them, etc. I don't know if it was because we appeared to be the only people doing the couples swim during our session, but we were the first group in and the last group out, and I don't think anyone else did two foot pushes. I also didn't see any other groups get to swim across holding on to each dolphin's dorsal fin. We were given the opportunity to ask plenty of questions, and our trainer Jon did a great job explaining the facilities and how the training process works. You could also totally pick up on the different personalities between our dolphins. When we were doing a lift with the male that the female hadn't yet been cleared to do with visitors, the trainer had to hold her the same way because she gets jealous and he didn't want her to feel left out. The male dolphin also seemed to LOVE being petted.The water is divided into separate sections by the walking platforms, and there were two other groups in our section (each with four participants). It never felt crowded or like we were getting in each other's way, even when doing the foot pushes.Yes, the photos are EXPENSIVE. They took something like 115 photos of us, along with video footage. Individual photos were about $29, or you can get all photos on a CD. If you get the DVD and all photos, the photos come on a thumb drive. I understand why they don't let non-participants wander around the platforms taking photos, but if you have a friend with a great camera, they might be able to get some action shots from the family viewing area (depending on which area of the water you're in).All in all, it was a fantastic experience that I would definitely recommend to anyone considering it. Don't let negative reviews based solely on the prices of the (optional) photos scare you away. It was a blast and I will never forget it!"

And it was a lot of fun (how could petting a dolphin NOT be exciting), though I didn't realize when booking that just because your group is limited to 4 it doesn't limit the crowded craziness. It just means one dolphin assigned to the 4 of you. There were at least 20 people in the water at once, all quite close to each other, and I was split from my group and hanging out alone at one end for a while as they were trying to coordinate the need for 2 dolphins to do each \"foot-push\". I was sent to do it early and then waited at the end of the enclosure for the rest of the \"tricks\" when our dolphin and the rest of my group came over. We did the 9:15a swim, so perhaps it was a really popular time? I have a feeling it's generally a crowded crazy place - they're set up to maximize profit. Like a big, loud, conveyor belt.The sad thing was, I asked where the dolphins live when they're not \"working\". The answer was that they stay in the same small performance area ALL THE TIME. A trainer mentioned one dolphin had been keeping her eyes closed for the past few days after a fight, and I had to wonder if they fought due to overcrowding? If nothing else it seems like they'd get bored of the same tiny space. Sure they can swim in circles, but I think they deserve a place to really swim fast and for longer distances - just like a horse needs to run around in something bigger than a small paddock to really stretch its legs. I thought they might have an enclosed bay they can let them into when the workday is done. But no. The pictures: I expected them to be outrageous but it was worse than I thought. And when you get out of the water, you aren't allowed to stop off and use the bathroom and change your clothes or anything. Nope - herded directly to the air conditioned gift shop while dripping wet so they can push you to buy pictures. We figured we might buy 3 of the 22 they had of me, but it would be $87!!!! To buy one was $23, and the whole set would be $80. Crazy. I bet they'd make a LOT more money with a lower price, maybe $8-10. Less profit per picture but many more people would be willing to buy them. Most of the people around us declined, they couldn't believe the ripoff. I decided to just go home with my memories. But the limited space for the dolphins taints the happy thought. Glad I saw what it was like, but won't be returning as I'd feel too guilty. I wonder if Dolphin Discovery is better, as they have certifications for animal treatment from American organizations."

The dolphins were incredible and seemed to enjoy the playing around with all the visitors. It was also a lovely setting and more natural than many of the places you see on TV which added to the experience.The photo packages were expensive, we paid $259 for the couple's upgrade, so we got extra pictures with the two of us with the dolphins plus several prints, a DVD and an incredible photobook. Yes this is very expensive, however for a once-in-a-lifetime event, I would recommend it. The photobook is great, with 28 photos chosen by us and is a fantastic keepsake.

Seeing the reviews about the high photo prices is exactly true, the way to do it though if possible is to have someone in your group watch from a deck (no extra charge for them) where they are allowed to take photos. It worked great, and with photo editing I have zoomed in on the shots which turned out great. We did however still purchase 1 8x10 of each of us, but even just those 2 came to $60. All that being said though it really was a great experience, more then ample time spent in the water with the dolphins, didn't feel shorted one bit. Our group of 4 people shared 2 dolphins for the hour plus in the water. The facility was nice and the trainers very educated, came away feeling good about how the dolphins were cared for here. We didn't do anything else at the facility so I can't rate any of their other services. The photos we did purchase are great quality. Would definitely recommend this experience and facility to others! We paid $159 per person."

Having done a one hour swim with Delphinus at Xel- Ha last year, this year we wanted to spend more time with the dolphins so had booked the Trainer for a Day package online before arriving in Mexico. We wanted to understand how the dolphins were treated, and to have as much interaction as possible, and were not disappointed. Over the course of the day we were shown some videos but also got 5 sessions in the water, helped to care for the dolphins and were taught some of the hand signals the trainers use.It was very humbling to see the relationships that exist between the trainers and their dolphins and it was very pleasing to see how well they are cared for. As well as swimming with adults, we also got time with the \"babies\", and could not have asked for a better experience. Particular thanks go to Jon and Carla for their time and explanations.Swimming with dolphins is an amazing experience which is over all too quickly, and this package enables you to spend a wonderful day with the dolphins and their very dedicated trainers. But it is worth remembering this is not a theme park and whilethey are well trained and cared for, the dolphins may from time to time not do exactly what is expected, but that's the beauty of living things ... they make choices.At the end of our day, we were presented with a certificate and then offered the opportunity to purchase the photos and video of our day. As has been previously mentioned this can be expensive, but there is no pressure to buy, and the quality of the items we received were very good. We will definitely return to Riviera Maya and would definitely return to Delphinus for the opportunity to spend more time with these amazing creatures. If you are a dolphin fan, and want to have memories that will last a life time, I can't recommend this enough, and if memories won't be enough for a maximum of $253, you can have a video, photos on a usb, an album and 4 printed pictures with other packages available for less.Its an amazing opportunity to interact with nature ... if you want a theme park, take another trip."

We went for the platinum trip through our tour operator, first choice, which wasn't the cheapest anyway at \u00a3263 or $400 (for both of us) Swimming with the dolphins was amazing and something that was on my husbands bucket list. No cameras allowed!!! Good amount of time spent with the dolphins then the real heart break came when they took us to view the pictures and video and they showed us the prices!! Absolute rip off which was very upsetting as there were a few photos we would have wanted but refused to pay $200 dollars for a set. We settled with 2 pictures at $60 dollars just so we had some evidence to show our family as we are honeymooning. Even more annoying is one of the reps there offered to get us the DVD of all photos at $100 after realising we would not pay the rediculous prices, which added fuel to the fire and made us feel they were just trying to rinse us dry of any money they could get. Food was pretty poor but service from food hall staff very nice. My husband brought me a cute stuffed animal inside the park which was 375 pasos roughly \u00a320, or $30, only to find when we came outside the park to the on site souviner shop, the exact same stuffed animal was 85 pasos. OMG this annoyed me immensely. If we were not waiting for a transfer I would have gone back in and asked for a refund and rebrought from the shop outside.!!!!!! Disgusting. This topped with the rip off prices of photos really ruined the day for me but glad I can say we have swam with the dolphins."

We had already swam with dolphins in Discovery Cove in Florida. At Delphinus, you have a lot of time with the dolphin - plenty. Between some of the activities, we simply floated in the pool (we had lifejackets) and the dolphin swam round the group, and we could watch the dolphin and stroke it as it passed. Having a small group of 4 is also excellent. I would rate the activities and time spent with the dolphin better than at Discovery Cove in Florida - which is saying something. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the photos. You are not allowed to bring a camera - I can understand that. But I would expect that the photos taken by the 'professional' cameramen would be good - they weren't. I would also expect (unless I had seen tripadvisor reviews before we went) that the photos would be priced at a level that wouldn't require me to remortgage my house! The prices were absolutely ludicrous - and for very average photos. They have made a poor business decision - everyone we spoke to said the same - that they would have bought photos if they were more reasonablly priced, but they had bought none because they were ridiculously expensive. A good memory, but one that was left out of the photo album!!"

First of all I should say that if you pay list price for this you didn't research. I could buy the $109 dolphin ride for $79 at an agency at Wal Mart. Hotels offer same package for a discount as well. At check in, they offered the upgrade program (Primax 4) at $50 discount per person, but I declined, which I regretted later. On the Primax 4, you have 2 dolphins for only a family of 4, while on dolphin ride you get 1 dolphin for 10 people and less time.The program is pretty basic and the girls complained about the little time and not being able to interact as much as expected with the dolphins. The trainer seemed bored and wanting to complete it fast, as it was the last activity of the day.However, the worst part was still to come. As they don't allow cameras in the activity, you are forced to buy from them if you want some remembering. Each picture costs ridiculous $30 and if you want to buy all pictures you'll pay around $200. Complete absurd!Overall, I didn't like this company and would recommend trying a competitor."

She always asks in advance for the same dolphin, Wayak, and Delphinus has always arranged that special dolphin for her. The trainers are always so kind, and have even changed up the program so she can have different experiences with \"her\" dolphin each year. The pictures, video and book are wonderful, and definitely worth the price. We have purchased the full picture set each year. The photos are professionally done and the stop action shots are so much better that I could ever take with our camera. When you consider that places like Disney World, Six Flags, etc charge $10-$20 USD for one picture of one ride, the cost of the package is very reasonable. Also, we stay on Cozumel Island, and they have even had a person deliver the beautiful book to our hotel later in the week. (The book isn't immediately available after the swim - nut it is worth the wait for the professional and keepsake quality.) The dolphin swim, especially The One, is worth the money for the wonderful experience and excellent service. I would not hesitate to recommend this experience to anyone traveling to Riviera Maya or to Cozumel!!!"

We chose the Primax 4 - which was four people with one dolphin for 45 minutes. It was quite expensive - but well worth it. Arriving at the facility we changed into our swimsuits and left everything in secure lockers. They don't allow cameras down by the docks so we left them behind as well. We were told to bring towels from our resort, but we didn't need to, as Delphinus provided towels for us.After watching an orientation video on dolphins (where to touch them, where not to touch them, etc.) we were divided up into our groups and went out to meet our dolphin. The first part of our swim was quite gentle. We went into the water and the four of us hovered in a large square while the dolphin swam around and beside us. We were able to touch her which was amazing! Then we got to do the Foot Push, where two dolphins swim underneath you, one nose under each foot and push you up and out of the water and then swim quickly down the pool. Very exciting, although the landing can be a bit hard! Then the dolphin did some tricks with us and there were the photo-ops with each of us kissing the dolphin, the dolphin smiling at us, etc. Dolphins are amazing creatures and it felt kind of sad to see them \"captive\" like this.At the end, we got to review the photographs taken by the facility photographer and a video of each of us doing the foot push. And then the prices... over $100 for a basic package!! Given that we had already paid quite a bit for the experience, we didn't get any photographs - and so the dolphin experience lives only in our memories!"

I never submit a review because I believe its a personal opinion, BUT, with what had happened in Delphinus Riviera Maya - I felt that all rules were broken.I'll start by saying that 2 years ago we were in Mexico - same hotel and took our 2 youngest children to swim with dolphins in Puerto Aventuras - which was AMAZING!!!SO, I CAN COMPARE THE 2 EXPERIENCES.This time my oldest ( 19 years old ) wanted to swim with dolphins as well.The facility is nice although you feel from the first moment that it was designed as such that you as a visitor will not be able to take pictures and will have to buy an expensive one. The first 20 minutes out of 45 minutes = $159 ( CRAZY) the dolphin was swimming near the group - did nothing! the other groups already start with some plays with dolphins, after I confront the manager they replace the instructor and start doing some activity.60-75% of the time is taking pictures so you will have to buy later.Other group they forgot to do the major attraction which is the standing play with 2 dolphins.They are unprofessional, and have to wait to a different instructor for each play.It is defiantly \u201cMisleading & over-priced\u201d.If you decide to go swimming with dolphins, which is AMAZING thing, do it in Dolphin Discovery Puerto Aventuras."

Turns out there were two that were shared between two families, and the other people who paid less were just in a different area doing the same things with their dolphins. Our dolphin was young and didn't want to do the tricks they promised us, so we were left wondering about all the things we were missing.I brought an underwater camera which was quickly removed from me until after our experience so they could take their own \"professional\" photos to sell us - which did not include any photos of our entire family even though we were all out there together the whole time, The dolphins seem over-worked and they had a hard time getting them to do all the tricks they were supposed to.We had a great time overall but felt that it was misleading and we were very disappointed when we heard the $250 price tag on the video/pictures. We bought it anyway, as it is a once in a lifetime experience. I would recommend paying for the least expensive dolphin experience here, as it appears everyone gets the same experience.It would have been great to know they had lockers on hand before the experience so we could take our wallets etc.In contrast, we did a 10 hour day with Edventure in the jungle/cenotes etc. that was less than half the total price of this 45 minute experience. There is no comparison with the value of these two experiences. There are competitors who do the dolphin experience, I would check into them as well before deciding on what to do."

However I just wanted to make people aware as to the experience I had at \"Delphinus Riviera Maya\".I contacted Delphinus before I went on holiday and booked the Couples Dream Swim. Delphinus were very helpful in sorting this out for me and quick to respond to any emails I sent.Myself and my partner were picked up from our hotel and taken to \"Delphinus Riviera Maya\". We did the usual things of checking in, shown lockers, brief from a staff member and then off we went to swim with the dolphins. The trainer was very nice and we had a great experience.We were then lead away by the photographer whom showed us were to put our life jacket and showed us into a room which had numerous televisions and computers contained within it. We were shown a video of our experience and photos as well. As it was our first time at swimming with the dolphins we asked how much the photos were. Hold your breath.....the photos were 123USD and the video was 50USD. Coming to a total of 173USD for pictures and a video. I asked if that was the lowest price and the two staff members said yes. (they new that they were over priced and would not budge at all) even thought I stated that my parents had only paid 73USD and I had seen the receipt before I went on holiday. They said the maximum they could do was 10% off. I ended up paying 153USD for pictures and the video!!I was very shocked by the price of these pictures and video, for the same price I could swim with the Dolphins again and get the pictures and video at another venue where I have swam with the dolphins before.I contacted Delphinus the day I got back and they said they had not received my email. Since then I have emailed Delphinus 3 times sending them my email with my concerns.I emailed Delphinus stating that I was concerned about people being over charged for photos as I was unsure If the photography is a part of Delphinus and if they knew what people were being charged. They did not conatact me at all and still have not to date, however they are very quick to reply when making enquiries or booking.I my have been over charged, however I just want to make people aware as to what to expect. My advice is only my opinion, I would advise that people do not go to this venue at all! The service you receive at many other Dolphin sanctuary\u00b4s is far better than the one I have just experienced."

We rate it higher then Xcaret, Xel-ha, Chichen Itza, Tulum, etc. I think the key is to book one of these in a smaller group size like the Primax so you don't feel like just a number. The place wasn't very busy the day we were there and so they weren't really using their main lagoon. Instead we went off to the right side to a long winding river like lagoon, which made for an amazing setting. What I didn't understand was that there were people walking about from who knows where taking photos and I'm not talking about the Delphinus photographer, random on lookers. That was frustrating as it was my understanding that family members taking photos was forbidden. Had I known this was now acceptable I would have had some family members stick around so I wouldn't have had to pay the $202 for photos/video. I would have like to have given it a 5 start, but for this very reason it loses one star.The swimming, petting, and playing with the dolphins is really a once in a lifetime magical experience. If the money is an issue I'd say just go for it. The one hour we had felt very adequate. After it was done we got them to go down 5% on the photo/video package so we paid $202 for all the photos and video of the four of us. Not too bad if you break it down per person. The dolphins looked plenty happy to me so I'm not buying into the whole cruelty thing."

Having read the reviews on here we were both quite comfortable with it. However on an earlier trip snorkelling one of the guides had told us how inhumane it was - we checked up a lot of what she told us on the internet (got to love google and wikipedia) and found that almost all of her views were little more than urban legends. So, assured that we weren't visiting a dolphin prison camp we set off full of expectation, and these expectations were truly met. Everything was well organised and set at just the right pace so it didn't feel rushed, and being one of the early groups but not the first meant we got to watch others go through their session.Once in the water the trainer was excellent, although overshadowed by Siij the dolphin! The hour went by in a flash, and the dolphin foot push is something I will never forget!Afterwards we were shown the pictures that had been taken and the video of the foot push for each of us, and whist these are relatively expensive for what they are they are memories of a once in a lifetime event. It was at the checkout when I realised that I had left my credit card in the hotel but for a small fee ($15) they sent the photos and DVD (and USB stick) to the hotel - I'm sure we weren't the first to do this but it was nice knowing that we would still be able to get these things.Overall this is a highly recommended experience, and having watched the trainers with the dolphins after our session (and also at the sister site in Xel-Ha) its obvious that there is a real bond between the dolphins and their trainers and that the dolphins do get something positive out of this as well."

The resort is set in natural grounds and is very clean and modern with good shower and toilet facilities. Safety show prior to entry is good. My only negative feedback is that the pictures are VERY over priced. Whilst i appreciate that photos cannot be taken by spectators ...... They wish to make extra funds from the sale of them ...... It was such a bad end to the experience when we were taken to a room where they try and sell you all of the photos. At 179dollars I felt really ripped off and rushed. You then have to sign a disclaimer. Delphinus - your resort, staff and dolphins are great, you just ruin it with your price of photos !"

Having never done anything like this before, we wanted to do more than just a 45 minute foot push. We spent all day at the centre and a huge amount of time was actually spent in the water with the dolphins. There was a group of just 6 so didn't take long before it was our turn to have a go at whatever activitiy was asked of us. We did a foot push, dorsel ride, stroked the dolphins, instructed the dolphins, had the dolphins sing to us and loads of other stuff. I'm very sceptical about keeping animals in captivity, but I do believe that these are well looked after and don't suffer any detriment. I can totally recommend this trip. You can't take your camera in so take some cash to buy the pics & video, costs us approx \u00a3130 for the whole lot (per couple) - a bit of a rip off but it's a must!

This was certainly a good experience for people that have already done the swim before but also would be a great experience if you have never done this before. Multi lingual trainers meant that no-one was left confused, they made us feel welcome & educated us about dolphin behaviour & anatomy. It was nice to see that these people clearly care for the mammals & not solely looking to make a fast buck. We were also informed that the staff actively encourage normal dolphin behaviour - they didnt seem to force the dolphins into performing. They also informed us that part of the very expensive fee we pay goes towards allowing disabled children from the local area to come for free. So even though it was a lot of money, it was nice to know these disadvantaged people were being given a wonderful experience."

The place itself is lovely & the trainers are great.This dolphin experience doesn't incorporate a dolphin show but they do tricks whilst you're in the water with them which I think is much better! Each person has some one on one time with their dolphin where you'll dance with them & even give them kisses! They're really friendly & interact with everyone so well. Our group moved from one pool to another because one of the male dolphins wanted to spend time with his girlfriend which was sweet! You could see that the trainers have the dolphins best interests at heart.You also get to do lifts with the dolphins which is a bit scary but was our favourite thing!Generally, you're in groups of 4 so you will be put with other people of you're a couple. This didn't bother us until the end of the experience when we realised that our video was not only with the other couple my boyfriend & I were with but also another group of 4 people. This felt like a bit of a cheat!The photos & videos are VERY expensive! You can't take cameras in so if you want a nice reminder, be prepared to pay out for it. Photos are $29 each & this is only with one person & the dolphin so if you're a group you'll have to buy individual photos! The whole CD of photos was something like $120, the video DVD was $59 & the two together was $170 odd! These extortionate prices kind of put a downer on the whole experience but hopefully being aware of this will make it better for all of you!Overall, the experience was fantastic, it was one of the highlights of my holiday!

I was the only English, two spaniards and a German, I was extremely impressed that the trainer could speak all 3 languages perfectly however as she had to say everything 3 times this caused quite a delay in every activity so felt like we didn't get to spend as much time with the Dolphins.I was impressed with all the activities with the dolphins especially the foot push which is an amazing experience. I paid $159 for the primax swim including transport from the hotel. I was happy to pay this for an amazing experience plus hoping the money is spent on looking after the dolphins. I was not happy however at the cost of photos and DVDs. All the swims are videod and photographed and then it is your choice at the end if you want to purchase any of these. The DVD is $69 I was not happy to pay this knowing there was 3 strangers also filmed on the DVD. The photos of me on a disc was $69 and then 1 individual photo printed is $29. I think this is extremely overpriced and taking advantage of people who want the picture momentos of such an amazing expedience you will probably only do once in your life. I only purchased one picture at $29, I couldn't justify the $69 for the disc however now I regret this as I don't have the photos to show friends and family. I am not sure if photo disc can still be purchased or if these are deleted immediately but my family wish they could have bought this for me. All in all it was an amazing experience with the dolphins but could have been improved. I think many more people will buy the photos if the photo prices are more reasonable!"

I looked here and on-line to try and decide which experience would have the best care for the animals, large enclosures, etc. I couldn't find much comparison between the options so I went with the one that \"looked best\" from their website and was close to where we were staying.We did the Trainer for the Day with our family of 4 (2 daughters ages 9 and 13) and my daughter's friend and her mom.We had 3 morning sessions with 2 breaks, then lunch, then 2 afternoon sessions with 1 break. This was well-organized and planned. After ~30 minutes in the \"pools\" with the dolphins and trainers you would get out and warm up in the area where the lockers/restrooms were. We learned a lot about dolphins and had the opportunity to \"train\" them ourselves (give the hand signals to do certain behaviors). We worked with several different trainers and different groups of dolphins. The trainers were patient and an lot of fun. Everything was very clean.Tips: you don't need to bring much with you. You get a fresh towel every time you get out of the water. You are not supposed to wear sunscreen, but you are in the sun alot. We wore rash guards (swim shirts) over our swimsuits, and used an \"eco-friendly\" sunscreen on the skin not covered by the rash guards (mostly our arms and faces since your legs are down in the water). No one said anything to us. I also recommend packing some snacks (especially if you have kids) for the breaks. You get a soda in the am and pm break session, but no snacks.Photos: Brace yourself. No cameras can go in the pools. Photos are $30 EACH for an 8x10 (the only size available). The video is $60. The other \"packages\" available start at ~$134 for 1 swimmer up to ~300+ for multiple swimmers. We ended up buying the cheapest package for 2 swimmers (the kids) for ~$185. This included the video, CD of all photos of the 2 kids (not parents since that was and extra $100!), and a very nice photobook of the 2 kids. They items are good quality and the photos are very good, but OUCH!"

You then proceed through some lush green vegetation to the ticketing area, where you either purchase a ticket, or hand in your travel-agent provided tickets. After that, you're shown to the area with lockers and change rooms. There is ample storage for everyone, and lockers have a key which you can take with you. You then sit through a brief presentation of what NOT to do around a dolphin, as well as what is allowed, and are handed a life jacket of a suitable size (mandatory for everyone). After that, you're lead to the main area where the dolphins and instructors will actually swim with you.The actual activities with the dolphins were a lot of fun (you're allowed to pet them, especially as they swim around you). Furthermore, the dolphins are taught a whole slew of tricks which makes it fun for everyone. Definitely an enjoyable experience, and well worth it.During the activities, the photographers will take photos of you, so do make sure you look at them at least a few times. The \"water\" experience (the actual time in the water with dolphins) is probably just over an hour.As you exit, a towel is provided for you.The instructors were very helpful and friendly, and you could tell they tried their best to make sure you had fun. Dolphins were amazing to be around - some would swim around you and at times, so close as if looking for more contact. Very neat experience.As you exit, you're offered the photos and/or videos for sale. This is where it gets a bit pricey. All together, photos for a couple will run you around $120 USD, and potentially more with videos. If you have a larger group, it makes sense to buy photos for everyone, as it will be slightly cheaper.As this is one of those in a lifetime experiences, we chose to buy the photos, however, the staff are not pushy at all, and you don't have to, if you choose not to. Keep in mind that you're not allowed to be as close to the main dolphin swimming area as the \"official\" photographers - therefore if you leave someone at the gate, their pictures will not be as good as the ones offered for sale at the end.One more thing to note, is that we had a mishap with our pictures, and were actually handed the CD with someone else's photos. We discovered this as we got home, and quickly got in touch wit the staff at this location (you can use the online web for on the main site to chat with a live person, who will give you the email and phone contact to each location). After providing that person with the date of our visit, Delphinus staff FedEx'd our photos to us on a CD in a matter of 3-4 days, at no extra charge! Overall, a great service for a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and still cheaper than doing similar excursions in the Bahamas or some other destinations."

We thoroughly enjoyed the morning, however were disappointed that despite being told my parents-in-law were able to spectate for free and take pictures of us, they were placed in a useless area where they were kept in the roasting heat with no shade and also could not see us due to an obstruction of view. You may think this was purely a fluke but whilst listening to the welcome talk, members of the staff were plotting out which areas of the park each group could be placed (after they had found out which groups had spectators with them) - this I feel is a con, as the staff obviously knew that by putting the groups in certain parts of the park, the photo opportunities for the spectators would be obstructed, hence encouraging people to purchase professional photos...which were around the region of $30 EACH!!! I understand the staff have a business to run and jobs to keep, but I feel that the prices for one photo were extreme - if the price had been halved we may have purchased one. Another trick they have is to not sell pictures of the whole group with the dolphins, which would mean a group could purchase one between them. Again, this is a clever and understandable trick but they need to think about families who would only purchase one for the family!! Despite my poor view of the positioning and cost of photos I do think the experience was brilliant and will remember this forever. Unfortunately my view of the company procedures on the above are not as positive."

This required a 7.20am pick up at our resort. We paid $178 usd each. We decided to choose delphinus over the other dolphin attractions in the area as we were led to believe the experience would be 2 dolphins to 4 people. This was the case for most of the day. In the afternoon however we ended up in a group of 9 people to 2 dolphins. Throughout the sessions the dolphins were constantly borrowed for other groups foot pushes etc (also in the same pool) which left us standing around for large periods of times.The main issue I have is that most of the day was spent sitting around between sessions when the dolphins had a rest (approx 20-30 mins between sessions sitting around). In total you only actually end up in the water for around 2 hrs max of the entire day. From the image viewing room however (which overlooked the pools) you could see clearly this was used to filter through other groups and not to give the dolphins a rest.On the positive side the dolphins are adorable and the lunch provided was superb.Other posts have commented on the rip off images and video and the fact you couldnt bring your camera in. We did see from the viewing area people able to take images but to get a decent image from this area you would have need binoculars. If you looked carefully you would also notice the foot push, dolphin jump etc always took place facing away from this area.....co-incidence??The total cost of the videos and dvd package was a hefty $179 usd or $59 usd for an 11 min dvd. In comparison to the likes of xplor which gives you all images on a memory stick for 2 people for $79 this is excessive in comparison. Alternatively it was $29 usd per image. I asked the staff member if we could buy 2 images on a usb stick just to be told we could only have them electronically if we paid the $179 usd the $29 usd images were of a print only. This put a bit of a dampner on the day.We went for the $59 usd dvd hoping we could use the likes of windows movie maker to extract images for facebook........delphinus being sneeky make the dvd unplayable by windows movie player.Back home I work in nature conservation and have been involved in marine mammals monitoring for a few years. During the tour when prompted to ask questions by the guide I asked about where their 'orginal older' dolphins had came from (hoping they were rescue dolphins). Around the park in various points they also state that the admission money is used for dolphin research. Hence I also asked what type of research they undertake in the wider environment outside the 'enclosures'. Disappointingly the various guides with us couldnt give a straight answer. Their research appears to be all in the interested of delphinus' and not a wider understanding of marine mammals etc....alarmingly they admitted some of the orginal dolphins were captured from the wild and not rehabilitated injured dolphins as I had hoped. They justified this by saying at once stage you could buy a dolphin in cuba for a few dollars.At around 2.30pm during another 'between session breaks' we were forgotten about by our guide and left sitting for around 50 minutes with a couple from Canada. After around 40 minutes I asked at the information desk if they could find out where our guide was to be told bluntly 'they are coming now'.....no apologies. Around 10 mins later they finally appeared having taken the German group away and forgetten about the english speaking group...again no apologies.Once finished hot water in the showers wouldnt have gone a miss in their changing rooms. Due to algae in the water it was pretty smelly. My swimming trunks still smelt after 4 washes.Overall mixed feelings on the experience...... the interaction with the dolphins was good but 1 to 2 hours would have been enough due to the sitting around."

Personnel were very attentive, knowledgeable and answered all the questions.We did the Primax experience, which offers 4 people per group to swim with 2 dolphins and it was really worth it!. You don only get to learn about these lovely creatures but also to enjoy being so close to them while doing tricks. The foot push along the lagoon is amazing! They are really strong animals, I was very surprised by their strength and yet their delicate attitude.You are followed by a photographer (private cameras are not allowed into the swimming area) while the trainer tells you how to position yourself for nice pics. Those photos with a short video are latter available- in a CD- at their shop. So if you wish to keep a memento of this wonderful time, be prepared to bring along around 170 US$ for them.There are lockers in the facility so you can go into the lagoon without worrying about your personal belongings. After the activity is completed they provide you with a towel. There are private showers available so you can rinse off the salty water and change clothes if you want."

I have been to Delphinus Riviera Maya many times and it's just as good every time. To me aswell as for many others it is very important that it feels good, that the animals are beeing taken care of and well treated, and they do in Delphinus. There are no pools but actual lagoons where the dolphins are, and you can see the trainers interacting with the animals and it just feels great.When in the water you get to know a bit more about the dolphins, they take great photos when the dolphin \"kisses you on the cheek\" you are \"dancing\" and aswell ofcourse, the footpush!! It looks really dificult, but it's actually the dolphins doing all the work, you just keep your legs straight and they push you up out of the water ahead of them. A great feeling!If you have short of time, do the Primax swim, where you are 45 minutes in the water with the dolphins. But if you have more time to spend on it I really recommend to do trainer for a day, you get much more value for money and you get to see more of how they take care of the animals aswell.This is really a great stop on your vacation and you should not miss it!"

It seems to me that this company treats the animals very good and cares about them. All the staff is very friendly and inform about the different aspects. They also have good information about their activities and how they are involved with dolphin saving programs. They told me that they have an internal law that say's that they can not capture anymore wild dolphins which I think it's very important. I hope they keep on doing well to continue with the respect they showed after their animals. Kindest regards to all the staff and hopefully see you soon again for an other swim!"

We got there we were greeted with a smile and after a video of what to do and what not to do we were more relax......... we met our trainer Lupita and our dolphin that had a mayan name, since we met them, they are huge animals we couldn't stop laughing and smiling, like they give us a good sence of something hard to explain we were just all in a good mood. We had a free swim with them, where they freely swim oround our small group and we can pet them, this was amazing, then we perform the foot push, where they push us from each feet along the water, wow!!!I guess we got to enjoy it more since we were only four doing it and Lupita was with us all the time helping us out!!! very nice.After this amazing experience we got to see the video and the pictures, I couldn't believe there were so many pictures, and we could pick from the computer, very modern, yes the price is high, but it is a most if we want to treasure this experience for ever!!!It was our best day in Mexico, and we would never forget this animals!!"

We chose Delphinus over some of the other dolphin experiences due to their reputation for excellent treatment of the dolphins and breeding programs. We booked our excursion through our travel agent in advance of the trip.We decided on the Primax option, and based on our experience, it was the right choice. The other groups had 10-12 people while we only had 4 in our group. So we had a lot of interaction with our dolphin, Kokai. We checked in, put our belongings in a locker and sat in the waiting area for approx 20 minutes. We watched a video on what we would experience and then a guide added in a few more explanations, divided us into our groups and handed out our life vests.We made our way out to the dolphin pools and were introduced to our dolphin trainer, Stephanie. We started by letting the dolphin swim around us and we got to pet her. This lasted about 5 minutes. Then we each got a turn to dance with the dolphin, have the dolphin give us a kiss, pose for pictures, and a few other fun things like having her splash us and swim around us a little bit more. We then lined up across the length of the pool while three dolphins jumped over us, which was fun. And we each got to do a footpush. Ladies, hold on to your bikini bottoms! We were in the water for the promised amount of 45 minutes. Many people have commented on the price of the pictures. We didn't feel the prices were so bad...we received a CD of all photos (about 40 or so) for $109. The pictures are great quality and they really capture your experience. We chose not to purchase the video so I can't remember how much it cost. Our dolphin trainer was entertaining and knowledgeable and you could definitely tell she loves the animals and her job.The experience itself is only 45 min to an hour, but plan on half a day for the transportation and waiting time. And granted, it's not an inexpensive activity, but keep in mind that you are swimming with amazing, smart and playful animals, which is truly an unforgettable experience."

I had wanted to swim with dolphins my whole life so I went to Cancun I signed up because I really wanted this experience. Let me preface by saying I ended up having a magical day, learned so much about the dolphins, got great photos, and had a blast.I did trainer for a day, and the program for trainers leaves A LOT to be desired. On the website it says 8 hour day so 9-5.... The staff tried to have me leave at 1:30... I was beyond disappointed. The head trainer was very nice when someone told her how I was feeling and invited me for another session to learn how they measured the dolphins and weighed them. That had been was I was truly interested in (not the smile for the camera parade from before). That 1 hour turned the day around into a magical event where I learned what I wanted to. Don't get me wrong: The staff were great, the dolphins were great, the program itself (trainer-for-a-day) just needs to be much more structured. I am wondering if it is at the other sites.I plan to def return one day and swim with dolphins again! It was a day I will never forget. I have looked at the pictures and video each day since.Good luck!"

            "review": "Worth every penny!!!. This was my first time ever swimming with dolphins. I'd always wanted to do it and it was AMAZING!I did a lot of research online trying to find the best fit for what I wanted, which was to spend the most time interacting with a dolphin that was possible without breaking the bank. There were a bunch of companies in the area I would be staying that offered pretty much the exact same thing. Around 50 minutes in the water with dolphins shared among 6 or so people. On the other hand, I also didn't want to support a place where the dolphins were not cared for very well so when I heard that Delphinus treats their animals well and takes them into consideration first I liked that.The trainer for a day program claims you spend about 3 and a half hours in the water with the dolphins and the whole program is about 8 hours long. I left my resort (picked up by Delphinus) at 7 AM and didn't return until 6:30 PM. I'd estimate a 40 minute travel time each way. Lunch lasted maybe half an hour, and we got a quick walk around the park adjacent to the dolphinarium that lasted maybe an hour. The rest of the time we spent in the water with the dolphins. We got to do everything from foot pushes, dorsal tows, trying out commands, meets & greets, kisses, dances, washing machine, and even snorkel to watch the dolphins underwater while they jumped back and forth as well as see the doctors working with the animals for daily health routines. The way this program is set up is that the dolphin gets his excercise and continues learning to do tricks like swimming on its back for their health checks. Obviously jumping out of the water is purely for entertainment purposes but the aren't asked to perform those tasks very often. And the dolphins genuinely seem to enjoy the attention the trainers lavish on them throughout the day, as well as the attention the tourists give them during free swim and meet and greets.Overall this was a wonderful experience and very educational without the boring lecture style. Throughout the day the trainers just converse with you and tell you various interesting things about the dolphins, how they train, why, etc. The pictures.... What can I say, they're expensive but if you think about it its not all that bad. My family of 6 spent $309 together for 140 digital pictures, a 10 minute DVD, and a really really nice photobook with thick laminated pages that was dropped off at our resort the next day. The pictures are all really sharp and beautiful and captures moments throughout the day really well. They do this constantly and you can tell they know how to point and shoot to get the money shots. You aren't allowed to bring in your own cameras (with the dolphins) but you can take them with you on the walk about in the afternoon and the lockers area looks down onto a few of the dolphin enclosures so its not like you can't get any shots of the dolphins yourself. Personally, I'm glad we weren't allowe to bring cameras in with the dolphins. I didn't need to worry about getting nice shots of the family throughout the day and making sure the camera was ready to capture the moments. Essentially you have a photographer for hire the whole day taking shots of you. I would definatly recommend doing the trainer for a day program. It was a wonderful experience and you get loads of time with the dolphins. Worth every penny!!!"

I really enjoyed the full day of interaction and it was worth paying a little extra. We had more time comfortable with the dolphins and practice all the hand signals with them. It was truly an amazing experience.Feeding them, asking them to flap their flippers, riding on the dorsal fin, getting a foot push, feeding them red heron and squid, and recalling them with a whistle was great! We even get to feel their teeth and tongue. The day is full of dolphin facts, and you meet adult and young dolphins alike.They have lockers, give you a shirt, provide non-toxic sunscreen, and a filling western lunch as part of the Trainer for a Day pack. The only problem I had was that they charge so much for the pictures. There are awesome pictures but be prepared to double the price of your experience. $25 each or $75 for all (about 15). A DVD video with dolphins jumping over you, and your interactions for about $60. I just wish the picture prices were more reasonable so I could afford more of them."

It almost makes up for the fact that there is a long wait to get into the water, that the pool is crowded, time in the pool is less than you pay for, and (unless you are very lucky to be part of a very small group), there is an assembly line feel to the experience. What truly tarnishes the experience, however, is the $159USD charge for 35 photos and a video. (This is in addition to the $99-259 admission fee per person). You are not allowed to take your own camera into the dolphin area, so the company has a captive audience, and takes every opportunity to gouge unsuspecting participants. We noted that the comments book was filled with notes from people indicating that the photos were simply too expensive. After our experience, others advised us that the other dolphin attractions in Playa del Carmen and Cancun provide much greater value for money. We would not go back to Delphinus based on our experience."

BEWARE - that translates here to a full 27 minutes for hundreds of dollars. They rushed us from beginning to end. It was so clear in the way they treated us that the sole purpose of this experience for them is the end point - to see how much they can rip you off for photos and videos. They were rude and unpleasant. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else for a Dolphin Experience."

            "review": "One of a Kind Experience. A very cool experience and we were very happy we did this. It was very well organized too. Small groups so you get to spend a good amount of time with the dolphins and not competing for it.The foot push was pretty awesome too. They make sure that everyone gets a turn to do everything with the dolphins. At the end you get free time with them and they just swim around you and you can pet them while they take a bunch of pictures of you.You can't wear any sunscreen which sucked for my husband because he burns easily and the sun is hot down there. I was okay though, but probably because we had ours before noon.The cost if you want pictures is a little rediculous though. You can't have someone up that close to take pictures for you so you if you want a memento you're kind of forced into paying for them. It was either $25 for one picture, we would've got two so that we each had a picture, kind of pointless to only get a picture of one of us with a dolphin if we didn't want to spend much money. Thankfully they had a 'deal' where you got a disc with all the pictures for $110, so if we would've got 2 pictures each, it would've paid for the disc. Luckily for us, our hotel had a $50 rebate for each of us so it basically paid for the pictures. Still expensive though.Overall it was pretty great, just a little on the expensive side."

My husband and I were in the water with one other couple and got the opportunity to do two foot pushes, get pulled by hanging on the dorsal fin, \"dance\" with a dolphin, feed a dolphin, kiss a dolphin, etc. We were in the water for about 50 minutes. The trainer was very informative and helpful. The dolphins are very well trained, and seemed like they are well cared for. It is amazing how powerful, yet docile, dolphins are. The price was expensive, but this experience was definitely worth the money.It is unfortunate that they gouge you with the pricing for pictures and the video, and that they do not let you take pictures while in the water. The pricing is absolutely ridiculous - $159 for a 10-minute video and 87 pictures, but we paid it because we figure this was a once in a lifetime experience.If you can afford to spend more than $500, this is a great experience."

The drivers were very courteous. Spoke to some people on the van and was pleasantly surprised to find out I had had a great deal paying 179$ for a full day when some people paid 120$ for a few minutes with the dolphin. So definitely book online and not through your hotel. Got to the location with my confirmation I had made online on the Delphinus site. Free t-shirt was a bonus. Our trainer was Emmanuel. He is awesome.Had a little briefing and headed out to where their offices are. Very interesting to see their installations . Finally got into the water and it was awesome. The dolphins are super friendly and it is a great setup. You don't feel like you are in a line up waiting to get on the ride like the regular customers. You feel like a part of the staff being in the pools that are hidden. You even have people from the xcaret park that come and watch. Lunch was included and the steak sandwich was awesome. The burger looked good too. In order to digest a little. Emmanuel even gave us a tour of the xcaret aquarium. It was a nice change of pace but I could not wait to go back in the water. The afternoon was more involving, doing a lot more of the controls with the dolphins ourselves. The crew is always around to take pictures so I had to take a look a the pics at the end. This is really where they can (get you). The pictures are expensive, but it is a great experience and I had to bring some back. I paid 129 for a 15 min video and about 70 pictures that were great quality. I paid 129 because I was alone and the couple with me paid 159 for the same bundle but they had more pictures.So it is a little heavy for pictures but seriously, how many time will I have that experience so It was actually worth it to get the pics.I would definitely recommend this activity to anyone that is interested by dolphins because 20 minutes is just not enough. Make sure you plan a full day for the trainer for a day program left at 7am and got back at 6:30."

For our 45 minutes we sat there for a great deal of the time as at least 50 people took turns swimming with the dolphins. It seemed very disorganized and incredibly impersonal. Especially for the price. All they do is want you to pose for the camera so they can rip you off with ridiculously overpriced photographs and video. My kids had a good time however and we did get to interact with the dolphins but I was hoping for a better organized more intimate encounter. The facilities are nice and the transportation was fine."

We got about an hour with the dolphins with just one other couple in our group. The trainers were friendly and professional, and we got to be pushed by dolphins, pet them, splash with them, etc. Pretty standard stuff for this sort of tour, but still amazing. We had a lot of fun.But you really get soaked after you get out of the water. I was hoping we could bring in a digital camera, but they don't allow it. Instead, you're stuck with a huge bill buying pics and/or a video taken by site staff. I was just floored at how much they were. I was expecting an extortionate $60 US or so, but the fee was $128 US for 51 pics and a 10-minute video! I wound up paying it, because the pics and video were great quality and this was kind of a one-time thing we won't do again anytime soon. Still, this left me with kind of a bad feeling about the entire day, which was otherwise a fantastic experience.Because of that, I can't recommend Delphinus. It's too bad, because the facility seems like a great place overall that does worthwhile work with dolphins in addition to the touristy stuff. I'd try another of the many dolphin places along the Riv Maya before this one."

We booked our Trainer for a Day on Delphinus, Riviera Maya via internet where all our questions were answered quickly and sweetly, which made us make up our mind whether to go here or elsewhere.First of all: These people are amazing. The trainers here are so devoted to their animals!Second: The dolphins are just too fantastic for words! Both DH and I had the time of our life, and we learned sooo much and had so much fun!Yes, the photos may seema bit pricey but the package deal is actually dirt cheap when you consider what you get for the money and where they go. If you're aware that there will be a cost, just take that into consideration when you book your experience and see it as part of the fee. It's not expensive and you get really great shots from a fantastic day/time!(We got 57 photos and a movie. Our friends got 90 photos and a movie, and they were there for an hour, so there's not a standard for how many photos you get, but they ARE good!)We just want to say:Emanuel, Chepe, Christina S, Azael and all the dolphins: We love you!(A special, wet kiss for the \"babies\" who we both fell deeply in love with.)This was the best thing I've ever spend money on and the next time we're in Mexico, we ARE coming back for another full day, you can count on that!! :D"

            "review": "Trainer for a Day, LOVED IT. On Dec 3, 2010, my 14-year-old son and I did the Dolphinus Trainer for a Day program at the Riviera Maya location on Dec 2nd, 2010. It is sort of connected to Xcaret, but we didn't pay an entry fee for that park, and entered the dolphin area from its own entrance. Short Summary: Dolphinus Riviera Maya location is \u201cattached\u201d to Xcaret, but not part of it. The facility is VERY clean and tidy, with entertaining trainers who speak English well. Some staff also speak French. Trainer for a Day program is an amazing value for LOTS of interesting behind-the-scenes time, lunch, and a total of about 3 1/2 hours with various dolphins (including all of the things people do with the dolphins on the 1-hour version, then much more). Note about the 1-hour version (Primax, I think it\u2019s called): we observed that those guests did spend 45-50 mins actually in the water with the dolphins, more that what is reported at other places, and they were in groups of either 6 or 8 (don\u2019t recall). Then they are shown their pics and videos with the option to buy.COMMENT ABOUT RATINGS: I think it is unfair that many of these reviews rave about the experience, then rate the place way down on the 1-5 scale for the expensive photos. I had to really READ to figure out that most people actually love the dolphin place & experience itself. Photo at LOTS of attractions cost \"too much.\" So do the magnets, the shot glasses, and the logo hats. It's a choice, buy them or not. Don't let it taint the whole experience. Nobody rates down movies because the candy and soda is crazy-expensive, nobody rants that Disneyland should have 2 stars because they charge as much for a burger and fries there as it cost for my dolphin photo ... I am writing a \u201clong version\u201d review now, since I didn\u2019t find much on TA yet about the Trainer for a Day option. I will provide details that I would have liked to know about:We chose the Trainer for a Day program because 1. we wanted a lot of dolphin time to connect with them since for us this was going to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and 2. if you are up for a full day of dolphins, its an EXCELLENT VALUE! We spent 8+ hours with the trainers! The list price at this time is $199 p/p, but with the 10% on-line or phone reservation discount (only do internet reservation if more than 3 days in advance so it has time to process otherwise call 800#), we only paid about $50 more than the people that only got 1 hour total. Warning: It's NOT for those who are not truly interested in learning more about dolphins and what the trainers do with them each day toward their physical, mental, and emotional care. We went in and out of the water 5 times throughout the day, for 30-45 mins each time (they promise 200 mins on website, it was that and probably more). Most of the time is spend behind the \"staff only\" cords, as they have more pools of dolphins than just the big ones everyone else has their experience in. Breakdown of 8+ hours:There were a total of 16 people on the Thurs we went. They broke us into groups of no more than 6. We were primarily hosted by Emmanuel, who is the trainer of the trainers. He spent a great deal of his day with us; the rest of the time we were assigned to various great trainers.-- About 3.5 hours in the water WITH the dolphins, every activity done by the 1-hour folks, then obviously much more.-- About 45 mins for a good lunch that is included, you can choose your meal from a list. Because lunch went fast, we got a bonus 20 mins in the very nice aquarium at Xcaret without having to pay additional to be there - Emmanuel walked us over personally on the \"employee only\" pathways. -- 3.5 hours total (broken up by in-water time) of education about dolphins themselves, their particular dolphins on site, and the methods used to hand-command train them. We learned about some of the trainers and their backgrounds and educational process, how they came to be there, the conservation efforts made by Delphinus. Additionally, Emmanuel explained the philosophy with which they train at this facility, and how they ensure safety of both the guests and the dolphins (which was interesting to actually observe with the 1-hour guests once we had learned the subtleties to watch for). We saw the trainers office, which includes the dolphin food prep and medical care area. Included in the price was a punctual pick up by Dolphinus from our hotel in a clean, logoed van.Dolphinus has a highly successful breeding program, which reflects their commitment to the dolphins\u2019 well-being. According to the lead trainer, Emmanuel, The owners have already made a great deal of $ in other venues, so they spare no expense in dolphin care, and treat their employees very well as well. After spending the day behind the scenes, it is clear the care of the dolphins is the first priority - they are not just their vending machines for the owners. Throughout the day, talking with various trainers and particular the lead trainer (Emmanuel), it becomes clear they have true love and concern for the dolphins first and foremost, and they create a very respectful relationship with the dolphins. The park could pack in far more rounds of tourists each day, but they don't because they are not only after huge revenue. Their schedule is set to give the dolphins a physical and mental break. They treat both their dolphins and their employees very well, and it shows. Yes, the photos and videos are expensive, but if you know that going in, just decide ahead of time what you will do. As a matter of fact, do everyone there a favor and gently warn the others before THEY go into the viewing room to spare them the shock. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime thing most likely, so just budget pics going in if you want them. You don't HAVE to buy them; we only bought 3 pics ($25/each if you choose separately), as we didn't love the rest (They truly offer the best value if you get ALL the pics, or all the pics AND the video). It would have only cost the 2 of us about $60 more for all, but we just didn't want any more than the 3. The package deals charges vary by your group or family\u2019s size, the prices are on a chart they put right into your hands. I can always YouTube someone else's video if I'm dying to show a friend what a \"foot push\" is. You can also have someone with a good lens (or at least high resolution to crop the shots closer later) take some pics from the viewing area. It's a shaded area slightly with benches above and to the side of the pools. Yes, at times the trainers will be walking on the boardwalks coordinating the events and block the view (not on purpose). Depending on where your group of 6 is placed, they may or may not get great shots, but if you're that tight on $, it's an option.I am slightly disappointed that Trainer for a Day only had the same pre-set shots as the 1-hour groups; they didn\u2019t assign a photographer to shoot any of the extra things we did, like actually give commands to the dolphins, or any candid shots interacting with/helping to train the 5 little dolphins, or leaning over an easy-going upside-down male to put our ear against his chest to listen to his heartbeat, etc\u2026"

We were picked up by Delphinus and it took just over an hour to get to the park. We were given a locker key, towel and t-shirt and showed to the changing area. once changed we were introduced to a few of the trainers. they were lovely and very professional. The trip was advertised as a group of 6 people. Thats all i was expecting. In the water there were 5 or 6 groups of 6 people all with 2 dolphins each. the pool wasnt too big so as you can imagine it was tricky doing the tricks like the foot push and dolphin ride. we had to take it in turns with the other groups and the trainers were switching dolphins and it all seemed abit un organised. every 45 mins or so you have to get out the water for 15 mins to let the dolphins rest. throughout the day there was a photographer and a guy filming everything. the day was fantastic until it came to the end and we were taken to watch the DVD and look at photos. before we went we knew if would be expensive for the pics but $25 each was a shock. the dvd was only about 10 mins long if that and that was $59. after paying \u00a3135 each to go we decided not to get any pics or the dvd. we have the memories of the day but it would have been nice to show family & friends back home the pics. Disappointing end to a great day!"

First, I'll tell you about the dolphin experience, because that was why we went after all.This part was fantastic - we upgraded to the 1 hour session with only 6 people (hey, if I'm going to do it, let's do it right, don't you think?). It was fairly pricey, at $159 per person. But I figure we'll only do it once. This package included towel service and a locker for your belongings.When you get there, you wait in line, register, sign your release, and are directed to the locker room, where you leave everything but your bathing suit and sandals. No cameras allowed, no matter what your travel rep tells you.We were then split into groups of 6 people, where we watched a video on how to interact with the dolphins, and led out to the water.We got into the water, the dolphins said hello and there was lots of interactions. We did tricks with them (or they did tricks for us rather) and it was generally a good time. After a bit we then switched sides, to 2 new dolphins, who are bigger and just as friendly. They then do the \"Kiss\" and the \"foot push\" which were very fun, and there are photographers taking pictures and video the whole time.Afterwards, I was really happy we had done it, we changed, ect, and went to browse the gift shop. This is where they try to sell you the DVD and photos from your day.What a total rip off. These pictures were $25 EACH. For the whole package it was over $200 and the guy made it try to sound like he was giving us a deal. Now we all know that we paid a lot to get in, and digital pictures cost practically nothing. I was so upset by that. I couldn't take my own camera and now you are ripping me off?We did end up buying 1 picture of each of us that went, with the dolphins, but mostly because I am a HUGE picture fan and desperately wanted some. My boyfriend felt so bad he offered to buy me the package but I was not having any of that.So, needless to say, I might recommend another venue after that ending, BUT as I haven't done any of the other swim with the dolphins programs, I'm not sure if this is how it is generally done.(By the way, I do understand that all the profit [ok, most] goes into research, and I can respect that, but SERIOUSLY? $25 a picture?)"

One would think that with that kind of money spent from one group you might get 1 picture included . Not the case. I love taking pic. but could see they have it set up there so the only one getting any kind of keep-sake photo is the hired photographers who do take great photos but at far too much for us to afford. We were split into two groups, one with six people and the other five of us and a stranger. The group of six bought the pict. video package at a cost of about $80.00 US each. We in the group of five and a stranger bought one pic. with the extra person in it and were on our way back to our hotel. The pool time with the dolphins and trainers was great and bar none enjoyed it very much. I realize a facility has to make money and am happy to donate to a good cause. The price for maintaining this facility I'm sure is not cheap. The cost to me for photos and video were a slap in the face to a group of people who combined had contributed already $1800 to help in the cost of running the place. We had a good time there but left with a bad taste in our mouths and it wasn't the salt water."

            "review": "Overpriced, overhyped and far from overjoyed. Firstly, let me explain my method of reviewing. My reviews are based on how true the experience is to the advertisement, the quality of facilities, friendliness of staff, and value for money. I do not mark my reviews down because I personally didn\u2019t have a good time or didn\u2019t like the activity. My reviews are based on hard facts. With that in mind, here goes!We booked this excursion for 4 adults through Thomson in resort. Pickup was on time in a branded Delphinus minibus. The bus was air conditioned and semi well driven apart form the 3 minutes where the driver decided he'd prefer to speak on his mobile phone. The bus was too small for the amount of people crammed in like a tin of sardines. The 'check-in' procedure was relatively quick and pain free and first impressions of the facility were good. Clean, well maintained with good clean toilets and showers however there was a lack of places to get changed unless you occupied a shower cubicle.The introduction was well organised and we were split in to our groups of 6 (as advertised) relatively quickly. It was at this point a major problem was apparent! There were 8 groups yet only 3 pools and the advertisement stated 6 people to a group and that each group would have an 'intimate dolphin experience' but I immediately couldn\u2019t see how this was going to work.Seven of the groups were led away to the 3 main pools and our group was taken round the back to a secluded pool which was very nice, private, and more importantly was shaded from the sun.All started well and we were introduced to the dolphin. We proceeded to do some simple petting of the dolphin, some typical splashing around and a talk of some dolphin anatomy. After this the remainder of the time was spend queuing up for a kiss and a hug (with a photographer) and not much else. This is where the majority of the time was wasted. We were then led to the main 3 pools, where all the other groups had been taken, to do the foot push. At this point the experience descended into chaos. All 3 pools had numerous groups in, multiple dolphins and more instructors that were needed. Conflicting information was given and no one really knew where they were supposed to be. One girl was nearly pushed into the surrounding man made rock wall because of incorrect instruction.When we had paid \u00a3110 per person for no more than 6 people in a pool, I was very annoyed. And the total pool time was 35 minutes, not the 1 hour as advertised.All of us had previously swum with dolphins in Cuba and Dominican Republic and rated the quality of the actual dolphin experience poor in comparison. That\u2019s taking away all the misleading information and faults and concentrating purely on the quality of the show as it were.After the experience we were show our video and photos. Presentation was good and the room was comfortable. However the real shock and kick in the gut was the price of the photos and video. The total cost of all the photos and video was over $220 (US dollars) which is over \u00a3150. A single photo was $25! Absolute extortion. Children and adults alike were leaving disappointed, some in tears, and some fuming from the prices. In conclusion, it\u2019s a poor experience in comparison to other places as well as vastly overpriced. Photos and video are just insane, and the quality of the video is pretty poor especially for how much you pay for it. How do I know? I complained to Thomson and consequently was compensated with free photos and DVD. The company was reprimanded by Thomson and told to buck their ideas up.Still want to do it? I'd recommend a company called Dolphin Discovery where you can also swim with other sea animals which are included in the price."

When we got there anyone that had a person not swimming with them was separated from the other all swimming groups. After the video on do's and don'ts, we were escorted to the dolphin area and the observers were placed in a small enclosure about 100 feet from the swimmers and dolphins. There was no shade in this area if you wanted to watch and the people from the Delphinus were constantly walking in front of us to block our view. I had a Nikon D70s with a 300mm zoom lense and zoomed in enough to tell it was my wife. The others had point in shoot cameras that will produce very little to remember the event by. At the end of the pool where my wife was there was a walkway that people were constantly going past on and many were taking pictures from there as it was obviously an accessible path. I left the enclosed area we were in and hopped over a railing to get to this area and was there for about 5 minutes before I was told that I was not allowed to be there. Now as an observer I was still charged money to be on the site. I considered arguing, but my wife was right there and she had no idea of the way I was being treated and I did not want to ruin this wonderful event for her so I went back to the sweltering enclosure. At the end of the swim my wife was shown the pictures and video that was taken by the staff. The cost was $25 per picture or 8 for $99. the package deals that included the video went as high as $239. I understand the company's need to generate income, but their attitude towards ensuring that only their pictures are of value is disgusting. I would recommend this excursion if everyone in your group is swimming and you are able to spend the money for the photos. If you do not intend to swim, stay at the resort or go to the beach, do not subject yourself to this disgusting treatment."

            "review": "Dolphins amazing, however.... The dolphin experience on it's own is fantastic. The interaction with them is an experience of a lifetime. However the place has glitches. Although they tell you that groups are max 6 people, we were able to book for 8. What they don't tell you, is that there is no discount for having a bigger group, neither is your time with them longer. So basically, you're getting less individual time and they are getting more money out of your group. Here's is catch #2, you're not allowed to take your own pictures, they take pics and video. They wanted to charge us $439 USD for the package and that was a 2 family deal. They told us that the video was free. Before we purchased, we were able to talk to other people...they bought the video fo $50 USD (so it's not free) and for one family the package was $150 USD. I don't know, but if my math is correct...that should be $300 USD not $439 USD. It actually sounded like they were making the prices up for the pictures, we all felt insulted. Recap: dolphins and trainers great, photo shop and the staff there at the photo shop TERRIBLE!"

            "review": "Great experience!. My family and I visited Delphinus Riviera May on July 20, 2008. This excursion is direct to the Delphinus property and not the Delphinus program offered at Xcaret or Xel-Ha...Prior to leaving for vacation, we booked direct w/Delphinus and saved some money-its much cheaper! We purchased four tickets for the PRIMAX package. We arranged for a shuttle from Delphinus to pick us up at our hotel and return us after-I have to say the shuttle was prompt and the van clean and air conditioned. Once at the park we were directed to the ticket area where they give you a souvenir along w/your ticket....I wont spoil the surprise by saying what it is. Then you are sent to the locker rooms to change and then to a brief video presentation of how to act when you are in the water with the dolphins...you are then given a life jacket and off you go in groups of 6 to start your adventure. The actual in water/interaction time w/the dolphins is 50 minutes. You are allowed to pat the dolphins, signal some commands, get a kiss, have them do jumps over your group, bubbles and the best part is the DOLPHIN PUSH (two dolphins come up behind you as you float on the water on your stomach, each takes ahold of your foot and pushes you forward till you are out of the water! It feels like you are water skiing-I was out of the water to my knees gliding across the pool-what a feeling-be prepared though as soon as the whistle blows the dolphins stop and you end up doing a face plant in the water...at least that is what happened with me! Each activity they take pictures and video and when the in water swim time is over they lead you to a phot viewing area where you have the opportunity to purchase pictures or videos. It was a great half day activity and one we will always remember!!!! It is well organized and the dolphin staff are amazing"
