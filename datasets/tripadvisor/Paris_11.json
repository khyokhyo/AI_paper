Knowing the history particular to any building, church, park or bridge is always helpful, but seldom necessary.

This glorious work of 19th century visionary architects, skilled engineers and gifted 'Art Nouveau' sculptors, bridges the Left Bank 7th Arrondissement with the Right Bank 8th Arrondisement in stunning elegance. Embellished with gleaming gold, bronze and copper statues of nymphs, cherubs, winged horses and angels with ornate candelabras and vintage lamps running along the parapet of the bridge, we have before us a beautiful 'eye-candy' ensemble. It is named after Alexander the 3rd, Emperor of Russia, to honor the 1894 Franco-Russian alliance and has been classified as an historical monument since 1975. Two sets of large Nymph reliefs at the centres of the bridge arches overlooking the Seine serve as memorials to this alliance - \"Nymphs of the Seine\" has a relief of the arms of France, while the \"Nymphs of the Neva\" bears the arms of Imperial Russia. I would recommend every first-time visitor to Paris to add this to their 'must see' list. The bridge not only straddles the beautiful River Seine but is a magical focal point with views of the Esplanade des Invalides and the recognizable golden D\u00f4me des Invalides in the 7th Arrondissement, and the Grand Palais and Petit Palais in the 8th Arrondisement leading on to Avenue des Champs-Elysees. If I get the chance to visit Paris again, I will try to book a hotel within walking distance of Pont Alexandre III so that I can have more leisurely time to enjoy it along with the Seine on a sunny day and at night as well. It is truly a romantic spot too with dreamy-eyed young nymphs and cute cherubs!"

But this is one of the most ornamented bridges in the world. And it gives you a beautiful view over the Seine and a chance to look at the dinners the poor tourists who booked one one of those dinner cruises get (stay away from those!). The bridge also figures in many movies - one of them Ronin (with Robert de Niro). The criminals meet under the bridge, probably to make sure their illegal actions can be seen by as many tourists as possible."

I love this bridge and this part of the river which is really busy with all the pop up bars, restaurants and floating bar nearby. It's really nice to watch all the locals wander along after work with a bottle of wine and a baguette and just sit next to the river. So nice, that we decided to have our own picnic! As it was Paris Plage when we went, which basically is loads of pop up beaches along the river, there are tables and chairs where families and locals gather to eat and drink on the hot summer nights. So, off we pop to the supermarket and pack our basket with everything from french sticks, cheese, pate, olives, ham, salami and 2 bottles of red wine for the grand total of 40 euros! The wine is only 3 euros in the supermarkets!! Off we went and found a little table right by the bridge and set up. We sat there for nearly 4 hours until we could see the Eiffel twinkling at 10pm, then we had a lovely walk upto the tower which was about 10 minutes walk. Perfect evening! During the day we spent time on the bridge whilst walking from Les Invalides which is also worth a visit."

As the link between the Grand+Petit Palais and Les Invalides, the bridge is hard to miss on your sightseeing journey, but nonetheless, Pont Alexandre III alone is definitely worth going out of your way to see!While Pont Neuf is a timeless beauty as Paris's oldest bridge, Pont Alexandre III exemplified Paris's neoclassic beauty. Both are certainly the bridges that are must-see within the City of Lights!"

            "review": "Most Beautiful Bridge Crossing the Seine. The 19th century Alexandre III Bridge (\u4e9e\u6b77\u5c71\u5927\u4e09\u4e16\u6a4b, French: Pont Alexandre III) is the most beautiful bridge crossing the Seine (\u585e\u7d0d\u6cb3) in Paris. It connects the Grand and Petit Palais on the right bank with the Hotel des Invalides on the left bank. The bridge was built for the 1900 Universal Exposition along with others like the Gare d'Orsay, the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais. It was built between 1896 and 1900. The bridge was named after Tsar Alexandre III (Emperor of Russ 1881-1894) to celebrate the Franco-Russian Alliance signed in 1892. The bridge was designed to avoid obstructing the view of the Invalides and Champs-Elysees with only 6 m (20 ft) in height and a single 107.5 meters (353 ft) long span steel construction. Alexandre III Bridge is a beautiful spot and a wonderful place to visit any time of the day or night. It is also a popular place to view the Eiffel Tower. Certainly we could not ignore those four giant 17 meter-high stone pillars crowned with gilt-bronze sculptures of winged horses representing the illustrious Arts, Sciences, Commerce and Industry. These four stone pillars are actually used as stabilizing counterweights for the bridge. You may want to enjoy it from the Seine via a sightseeing river cruise or river taxi. We saw the sculpted keystone called the Nymphes de la Neva in the center of the bridge, which can only be seen clearly from the river. We visited and passed by the bridge several times due to many attractions nearby. The Grand Palais, Petit Palais, Hotel des Invalides, and Champs-Elysees are all within walking distance. Of course, strolling along the Seine is also a pleasant experience.Like most of the attractions in Paris, many films and videos used them for scenes. Such as Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cMidnight in Paris,\u201d James Bond film \u201cA View to a Kill\u201d and Adele's music video \"Someone Like You\". Paris is definitely an amazing and romantic destination for travelers. Plan yourself at least a week in order to enjoy most of it."

The style of the bridge reflects that of the Grand Palais, to which it leads on the right bank.\"I strongly recommend that you do visit this beautiful bridge, as well as the Palais Grand, when in Paris."

The bridge is wrought iron, single arched, accented with old fashioned lamp-posts, and highlighted by 4 huge pillars with winged horses to protect it. There's also sculptures, basically sitting on the bridge at the midway point.On the Quai D'Orsay side of the bridge, you'll find the Grand Palais and Avenue Cygnie. You also get a great view of Southern Paris and the Eiffel Tower from here."

The bridge is named after Tsar Alexander III, who left the tripartite with Germany and Turkey to form the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1892. The bridge has the same architectural style of the Grand Palais, on its right bank. The unique thing about the bridge is it is a single span that is low enough to not block the view of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es or the Invalides. Walk along it, our take a boat ride to get pictures of the amazing crests along the side"

Or if you are at the Place de la Concorde, walk to the river for a view of this bridge. It is really nice.

Then I saw they had gone and we were alone for 1000' or so. Out of nowhere I felt my cross body handbag bumped from behind. I stopped, turned and gave the dark-haired lady a look. I told and motioned for her to go ahead. There was no reason to bump us because there was no one else around. She went around then turned back to make conversation to say with a smile, \"Excuse me madame, what did you say?\" I gave her another look and waived her off. She walked away. These people were all dark haired and light- brown skintone. The woman that came up to me had long black hair, wearing a scarf around her neck, well groomed but dressed very casual. I was very thankful how much I had read about this before our trip. My cross body was mostly in front of me and had zippers. All I had on me was lipstick and a few items anyway. Our important items were worn under our clothes and some in our under garments. On another note:We were taking pictures outside Berthillion Icecream on the island. When we returned home, I happened to zoom in on the people right outside the restaurant next door to Berthillion. You can clearly see a pickpocket working. I felt so bad that we didn't see it and were not able to help this poor lady when it happened. If you look at the couple to his left, the lady in the maroon long sweater, long hair and torn jeans, this is also how the gangs look and may be as well. It's so hard to see the forest for the trees, but please remember not to wear anything of importance on the outside of your clothing. Try to keep a distance, if possible, and turn around occasionally to see who's behind you. They hate that! They work in groups, then split up. You will see a lot working the major tourist areas. Be safe and have fun!"

But no, i saw lots of locks tied on the bridge railings. I understood from locals that lovers tie the locks, write their names on the locks and throw the keys in the river. its a belief that by doing this lovers will be always together beyond life.Amazing is nt it. the feeling of love is same everywhere.salute to true lovers"

It offers an unobstructed view of the Invalides complex and provides a great spot to photograph the Eiffel Tower. The ornate lamps and statues on this richly decorated bridge are absolutely stunning. The best place to admire the beautifully intricate ironwork is the river bank, from which you can see the bridge in all its glory.

Everything looks so close and there is the constant boat traffic underneath you. The golden guilding on the statues at either end of the bridge is beautiful and if you go down onto the embankment you can admire the ironwork running along the side of the bridge. A highlight of walking round Paris."

Otherwise, it's just like any other bridge in the city. A nice stroll along the Seine will likely land you here, which is also close to the Place de la Concorde, the Champs-Elysees, and Musee d'Orsay. To get here, the nearest metro station is Invalides on Line 8 or 14. If you plan on using the metro frequently--which isn't a necessity because Paris is a fairly walkable town--buy a carnet of 10 metro tickets for 14.10 euros, rather than paying 1.80 euros for each ticket individually. The 1-Day Mobilis tickets (for unlimited 24-hr use of public transit) are only economical if you plan on using public transportation more than 4 trips per day since it costs 7 euros."

Pont Alexandre IIIA Bridge as an artwork...My wife and myself were joyfully touristing- once more time- our dearest Paris, City of lights. We were covering the last segment of a cherished and long time planned Gastrotour de la France, but while in Paris somethings are a \"must-go\", besides those fantastically-expensive top rated restaurant included in our gastronomic schedule there. Our hub-hotel was, as always, \"Lancaster\", which is strategically located nearby center area of Champs \u00c8lys\u00e9es. Our touristy- day before - was all about our favorite among favorites Museum in the world...Museum d'Orsay ! Today we were having a long walk from our Hotel towards Champs \u00c8lys\u00e9es, and Trocadero-Tour de Eiffel, via rue de la Montaigne and its surroundings. When we go touristing we love to cross that incredible Seine River- back and forth- via its multiple beautiful landmark bridges. After Trocadero-Eiffel areas - its \"Branly and Champs de Mars\" Quais we did rest for a while - again- by the Quai d'Orsay, overlooking the river and those touristy \"Bateau Mouches\" boats filled with tourists from all over the world. Among those landmark bridges we already crossed Pont del Alma, Pont neuf and one of our favorites; Pont des arts This unique design for a bridge came about due to the innovative ideas of Napoleon I. Pont des Arts was the first metal bridge built in Paris. Arts seems to be a perfect name since the bridge has been the source of inspiration for numerous painters and artists. It is also frequently used as a popular picnic spot during sunny summer days. Once more time we were heading from \"Le Invalids\" towards \"Les Tuileries\"- Champs \u00c8lys\u00e9es, crossing over that bridge which is rightfully called the most beautiful one in Paris, because of its artfully features: candelabras, cherubs and nymphs. Its nymphs composition in the centre of the bridge symbolizes the River Seine. Amongst the multiple fantastic bronze candelabras, across the bridge, those towards the end of the bridge are much bigger featuring artworks of cherubs and sea monsters. The decoration along the bridge deck has been richly executed with an aquatic fauna and flora. At each extremity of the bridge are two monumental pillars surmounted by winged horses in bronze. The Pegasus on the South bank its said to symbolize War and those on the North Bank are symbols of Peace. At the feet of the pillars are groups of genies with fish and shells. Altogether this bridge is like walking throughout an art museum. Besides its intrinsic artistry, Alexandre III is a fantastic building work of engineering, with its almost 200 meters ( 520 ft) of span- as a deck arch bridge over the Seine river- and its 40 meters (130 ft) of Width, connecting the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es quarter with those of the Invalides and Eiffel Tower. The bridge is widely regarded as the most ornate, extravagant bridge in the city and It is classified as a French historic Monument. It was built in the same period as the Grand and Petit Palais for the 1900 World Exhibition. Its first stone was laid by Nicholas II on 1896, celebrating Franco-Russian friendship. Walking on this work of art , from Le Invalides towards Le Tuileries with those views across Seine river over magnificent Grand and Petit Palace, are a unique experience....one that I highly recommend to all art lovers, while in Paris."

They also opened another club under the bridge on the right bank, in addition to the club \"Le Showcase\", which has always been on the left bank of the bridge. In the summertime, there are always tons of people just sitting on the quay in groups having small homemade picnics and wine and waving to the tourist books passing by. Good times! Now we only have to wait for summer to come back again....Oh yes. Also had my cliche Paris wedding photoshoot on this bridge and the photos came out beautifully with a sunset and the Eiffel Tower in the background."

If you're lucky enough to be there when the tower erupts into its 10 minute light show, you'll be memorized. A thousand words (which is why I'm stopping at 752 characters) cannot describe the grandeur of this bridge, with its beautiful light standards and magnificent statues, and towering gate posts, which glitter with gold, even during thunder storms.

It was competed in 1900 during Universal Exhibition. It has overwhelming Art Nouveau decorations of lamps, winged horses, nymphs and cherubs at each end of the bridge. At that time it was a marvel of ingenious engineering with arched span of approximately 20 feet high spanning Seine. The design of the bridge was such not to interfere with view of Invalides and Champs-Eleesys. The bridge was named after the Russian Tsar Alexander III.Today, it provides one of the most beautiful sights in Paris and should a \"must\" to see and experience."

Among the best and cheapest outfits \"Les Vedettes du Pont Neuf\". They offer a discount if you print a coupons online. The best cruise in my opinion is the 9:30 p.m. cruise during which you can see 38 of the most famous monuments of Paris illuminated. These of course, include the Eiffel Tower and the Alexandre Bridge on the Seine River."

The Pont Alexandre bridge on River Seine connects the Grand Palais area in the Champs de \u00c9lys\u00e9es quarter to the left bank area of Eiffel Tower and Invalides. It's one of the most beautifully decorated and historic bridges in Paris.Constructed in the final few years of the 19 th century, this bridge is named after Russian Ansar Alexandre III To commemorate the Franco Russian Treaty. The delicate sculptures like Nymphs and the flying horses distinguish this bridge from the many others on the river.Can't miss this especially if one walks down the main Paris tourist areas."

The Romantic city of Paris is a city of Magnificent bridges too. The testimony to that is, around 37 bridges constructed on the Seine River within the city of Paris, including 3 pedestrian only bridges, while most are for vehicles also.Magic feel: It\u2019s a place really worth stopping by to experience the magical feel. If you have time remember to take some time to stop by this bridge and take some memorable pictures to appease your eyes with a good treat and to capture in your cameras and minds.Interesting facts: Among the 37, Pont De Alexandre holds a very special place, considering the Grandeur and history it beholds namely. History and Significance the bridge holds;Built in honor of the Franco- Russian Alliance signed in 1892 relationship; during the Universal Exposition in 1900, shows French dominance & built just after Eiffel Tower in 1889.Pont De, Alexandre III Connects Grand Palais with Des Invalides. An Architectural delight Then & Now, Single span bridge, by design its height kept low like other bridges across Seine in order not to obstruct beautiful views of the city of Paris and its magnificent buildings.Lamp Posts of the bridge is decorated with Sculptures, Cherubs and Nymphs. 56 foot Granite pillar providing single span of bridge acting that acts as a counter weight & on top is mounted gilded statues.As I learnt, different artistic sculptures on the bridge are made to represent 'Fames of France & Russia' on either sides of the bridge and Nymphs of river Seine & Neva (Russian river); and arms of France & that of Imperial Russia on the other side\u2026..Apart from serving as a bridge, the construction & inclusions of different elements of the bridge offers a magical experience, whether you walk across admiring the bridge as a pedestrian OR just riding under it on a river boat/cruise,The concrete, granite structure on top of river Seine, shine & glitter of the gilded statues, with background of special historic buildings around the bridge & on a clear blue sky; it is a wonderful site for a perfect picture!Few ref of Holywood: Some list of Holywood movies shot apparently on this bridge: Anastasia, Midnight in Paris ,Ronin, 'A Very Long Engagement' and \u2018A View to a Kill\u2019 Bond movie etc."

To really feel the romantic pulse of Paris, I recommend a midnight walk on, to me, the most beautiful bridge of the world: the Pont Alexandre III. A gift by and named for, a Russian Tsar, the bridge links the Invalides Plaza (on the Left Bank) and the Champs Elys\u00e9es (on the Right Bank) and has served as a backdrop for many a romantic film (think Ingrid Bergman, Woody Allen...). Broad but not intimidating, with voluptuously gilded statues and luminous lamps evocative of the gaslight age, the bridge is best experienced on a moonless but starry midnight, when there is hardly any traffic, both vehicular and human. Then one is overwhelmed by the magnificence of this utilitarian monument and one falls \u2013 again \u2013 in love with Paris."

One word of caution, be firm at detering the girls with clipboards that are on and around the bridge. Simply tell them no and don't give them the attention they are seeking. The clipboards with petitions are a scam. They just want to get you to \"donate\" money or distract you while they pick your pocket."

When we were there there was a tribe of persistent Roma girls trying to fleece tourists by supposedly collecting money for a child charity. Always sad to see as it doesn't do Paris's reputation any good. Don't let them stop you. Their marketing technique begins by asking you simply to sign a petition and before you know it they've conned you into getting your wallet out.

This is a direct line to Invaldes (the resting place of Napoleon and a military hospital from his time). We get the English word Invalid as in not able to walk not about being In-valid as in having no worth. Napoleon is remembered for his arrogance more than the good things he did and this is one of them. He created the hospital for all the war injured soldiers to care for them as long as necessary.

The River Seine is charming and seductive, and it's surely because it's very beautiful and manages to wind slowly through one of the most beautiful cities in the world. If that weren't enough, the many bridges (\"ponts\" en francais) that span her are all beautiful. But perhaps the most beautiful is the Pont Alexandre III, which beckons tourists (and yes, there's throngs of those every time you are on the bridge) to wander and stop while walking over the bridge. It's a living art attraction.Sadly, something about the bridges compels people (tourists?) to bring locks and affix them to the bridge. And anything else on the bridge. And anything even remotely close to the bridge. Not sure how this tradition started, but wow, does it need to stop. Some of the bridges now apparently are having issues because of the thousands of pounds of locks on them. The local authorities have (as of early 2015) started removing entire sections of walls of locks. There's even an organized movement to stop the lock madness. If you think I'm being an old curmudgeon, take a walk around town and tell me that placing locks on bridges that already have thousands and thousands of locks is not just plain crazy. But I digress... Go for the bridge. Stay for the view. And watch your pockets - as with most of Paris, where there are tourists, there are pickpocketers."

Walking along the River Seine from the Louvre to the Eiffel Tower, it looked lovely during the day. But at night, illuminated in beauty, it was perfect! I think i spent a good hour on a drizzling night, frosty winds, umbrella walking up and down, taking countless photos. As small and uneventful as it seems, it was definitely one of the main the highlighst of my trip :)"

There's often a very nice ice-cream cart on the rive droit end of the bridge (that's the side that the Eiffel Tower is not on!). I'd recommend buying one and then walking west along the \"Cours la Reine\", which has several interesting statues and memorials.Just past the next bridge (Pont des Invalides), outside the Palais de la D\u00e9couverte (Palace of discovery), is the entrance to a garden. Its winding steps, tranquil pools and shady path will surprise you and may be just the respite you're looking for after a hot day of site seeing."

Miraculously, I'd made my tipsy way to the insanely beautiful Pont Alexandre III over which I'd traveled dozens of times. I'd always thought it was magnificent and meant to explore it on foot someday and here's the odd treat I was given that day: I was standing mid-span when all of a sudden, the clouds parted and the world instantly turned from black & white to Technicolor. The huge golden statues guarding its entrances for more than a century became so bright they virtually blinded me. I spent over an hour exploring its many gilded statues and incredible architecture, all the while thanking the Paris gods for treating me to the spectacular introduction to this overlooked masterpiece."

The sculptures are spectacular, but it is also amazing just because there are so many bridges and each is unique. The love locks are really something. Please do not engage in this activity on any of the bridges. It is a problem in Paris because the bridges were not designed to carry the weight, and they worry that a key thrown in the water might land on a person on a boat and hurt them. Ironically, your eternal love is good for about 3 months, as apparently that is how often they remove panels and replace them. I don't think there is anywhere to put them on this bridge, but it was 9 months ago, so I'm not certain. They are neat to see though."

Joining the Champs Elys\u00e9es and the Grand Palais on the right bank with Napoleon\u2019s resting place, Les Invalides, on the left, Pont Alexandre III commands your attention from different angles and keeps you suspended in that state of wonderment long after you have walked away. We saw the whole stretch of the bridge from the boat when we did the Seine River Cruise in the afternoon and came back two days later, this time walking along the riverside towards the start of the bridge. We couldn't walk all the way across because it was raining heavily that afternoon with the wind blowing in icy gusts, rendering our umbrellas completely useless against the deluge. I mean I do understand why couples would feel extra romantic crossing Pont Alexandre III fingers entwined. Definitely doing that when we're back in Paris next year. After all, it's always nice to leave something 'unticked' for the next travel adventure.:)"

The Pont Alexandre III was built between 1897 and 1900 at the same time as the Grand Palais. It is instantly recognisable by its four towering pillars at each corner, topped with gilded statues. The flowing lines of the statues and street lamps are a wonderful expression of Art Nouveau which was popular at the turn of the century.The bridge is named after the Tsar who singed the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1892. Alexandre's son Tsar Nicholas II laid the foundation stone and was also there for the opening.Some of the decoration is only visible from the river. Huge coats of arms framed by nymphs of the River Seine and River Neva in St Petersburg adorn the central arch. The Seine nymphs are on the Eiffel Tower side while the Russian coat of arms faces the Louvre."

When I visited, there were temp toilets available. along side the river we have many logs lying around where we can sit for hours to gaze the river.

This \"Beaux-Art\" style bridge is considered the most ornamented one of Paris (with amazing results, I would say). It is also considered a real wonder of 19th century engineering, built with such care (rare at that period - late 19th century), aiming to prevent its construction from obscuring the views of neighboring monuments: the \"Grand Palais\" and the \"Petit Palais\" on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es area, and the \"Invalides\", in its other extremity. One extra reason to visit \"Pont Alexandre III\": it is listed as a French National Monument, what means how special and important it is! Enjoy!"

The foundation stone was laid by Nicholas II (the son of Alexander III). The Pont Alexandre III spans the Left and Right banks of the Seine River and is located near the center of Paris just north of Les Invalides and the Invalides Metro stop. It is also located just south of the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais. The bridge is classified as a French Monument historique ( a National Heritage site).I have walked by this bridge numerous times on my various trips to Paris and am always amazed at the ornate artwork of this bridge. I think this bridge is both an amazing piece of art and a stunning bridge. The last time I strolled across this bridge was with my wife on a Monday morning in late October. We also viewed it while walking along the Seine River and have also taken boat rides under it and gained a different perspective (still stunning). The views of Paris from the bridge are fantastic and I really enjoyed spending some time there.I really enjoyed the ornate figures, carvings and sculptures on the bridge. The bridge also has four stunning pillars near both banks with gilt-bronze statues of \u201cFames\u201d on top of each one. I think the Pont Alexandre III is the most stunning bridge in Paris and is my favorite bridge in this great city. It is probably the most famous bridge in Paris.Overall I love this bridge and thought it was stunning. I recommend that you see it up close when visiting Paris. It is very easy to visit since it is centrally located near many famous attractions and landmarks."

It is also the scene on its nearby quay of occasional antiques fairs. Not always realised, it was constructed in a single span, an innovation for the period. It is particularly a wonderful vantage point to look at many of the major sites of the city, not least the Invalides, the Grand and Petit Palais, the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre."

The 2 currently popular groups are the dropped ring people and the fake petition girls. We've had ample exposure to them in the last 4 months.Let's start with #1. You are strolling across the bridge when you hear a clink of metal on pavement immediately followed by a person asking you if this \"is your ring\". Of course, you say no. He/she then explains that he/she just found the \"gold\" (actually brass) ring, that it is obviously very valuable, and that he will sell it to you for a fraction of its value because he/she really needs the money. Best approach - ignore him/her. Most gratifying approach - tell him/her in French that you may not be a moron, but he/she certainly is.On to #2. You are crossing the bridge (or in the Tuilleries, or in front of the Louvre, or walking along the Seine) and a couple of well dressed, earnest young women who look like college students approach and in impeccable English (slight upper class British accent) ask if you speak English. A positive answer initiates a request to sign a petition. While investigating the petition, their accomplices either rummage through your purse for your wallet or pick your pocket. The best answer to the question is \"no\" in a language other than English (Nein - German, non - French, anyo - Korean, ohi - Greek or ack - Inuktitut: all work quite well). The best answer I have seen in 4 months here was delivered by a cop on the Quai d'Orsay. He saw a group of these people on the opposite side of a generous sized mud puddle. He sped up to the puddle on his mountain bike, hit the rear brake hard, and skidded sideways into the puddle, soaking the lot of them in muddy water. It was brilliant!Forewarned is forearmed."

Characterised by the stylish Buaux-Arts style of architecture which was much in vogue then, it complemented the creation of the Grand Palais and Petit Palais on the right bank as the site of the Universal Exposition of 1900. Still generally considered to be the most beautiful bridge spanning the River Seine in Paris, it strikes visitors for its over-the-top embellishments. Of particular note are the statues of nymphs on the bridge's sides and at the lamp bases. In the theme of the 1900 exhibition, look out also for the four golden (gilded, really) socle sculptures of Pegasus being restrained by 'Fames' (arts, sciences, commerce and industry). Views on the bridge aren't really very good because the bridge is quite broad, so the best vantage points for photos are on either side of the river (preferably on the southwestern side) or from a river cruise boat. Even more magical and romantic is the bridge when it is lit up from early evening onwards."

Failing that, if you are taking the Bateaux Mouches, give yourself a few extra minutes to go and see it, as it is a hop and a skip away."

As you stroll through the streets of Paris, among its countless architectural sights, you will find the Pont Alexandre III located between the Champs Elys\u00e9es quarter and the Invalides; it is easy to find, as you walk on Winston Churchill Avenue past the Grand Palais. The Pont is simply breathtaking with its multitude of sculptures, statues, figurines, candelabra style lamps and lamp posts. I recommend that you also go down the steps and walk along the Seine for another spectacular view of the bridge, bring a baguette and have a picnic!"

It connects the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es quarter and the Invalides and Eiffel Tower quarter. The widely regarded as the most ornate, extravagant bridge in the city. The bridge is lavishly decorated with lampposts and sculptures of cherubs and nymphs. On each end of the Pont Alexandre III are large gilded statues on 17 meters (56 ft) high granite pillars. Each of the ornaments on the bridge was created by a different artist. The bridge - which was to symbolize Russian-French friendship - was named after Tsar Alexander III."

Built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition, the bridge, named after a Russian czar, celebrated the new France-Russian alliance. The bridge shows off fine sculpture work, including cherubs, nymphs and winged horses on both ends. The gilded allegories atop pedestals on the right bank are Arts and Sciences; those on the left bank represent Industry and Commerce.I often cross the bridge on my frequent visits to Paris, either when taking a walk along the Seine or when heading from the left bank to the right bank to attend an exhibition at the Grand Palais or Petit Palais. I sometimes linger along the bridge's 525-foot length for a closer look at its artistic elements, such as the Art Nouveau lamps. It is possible to get excellent photos of the Eiffel Tower from the bridge, sometimes with sculpture in the foreground.I highly recommend checking out this bridge if in the area; as a destination for those interested in seeing the most ornate bridge in the city; or for getting a good photo of the Eiffel Tower."

Crossed the bridge admiring the statues of nymphes, the lamp posts. The bridge transports you into another century. You could reach Ave. des Champs Elys\u00e9es passing in front of the grand palais."

This bridge is very ornate and was built to commemorate an alliance between France and Russia that is easily forgotten today. I do not rate it excellent as it is located in an area where you have better attractions like the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower and Napolean's tomb and it is just not that good, but it only takes a few minutes to walk it so there us little reason not to visit it when you are near the Place Concorde.Many tourists take the river tour. We did two and each time they raved about the bridge and you get a good view of the statues underneath. So if you do a river tour first then you will probably know what you want to photograph. I think this is the most ornate bridge I have seen not just in Paris but in the world and I've seen many. We saw it in daylight but it must be romantic at night."

Very ornamented bridge on its upward and downward arches. That is a deck arch bridge. Due to its decorations, this bridge is considered as a French Monument historique.The Russian Tsar Alexander III of Romanoff dinasty is responsible if we can say this way, for the birth of this very nice engineer's achievement. In fact the Nicholas II, the son of Alexander III laid the foundation stone for this extravagant bridge,that in the architectural style reminds somehow at the Grand Palais, which is right across the Seine.I was delighted with this remarkable construction."

It's very different from the other bridges across the river and is worth a visit. I have heard good things about the view from the river cruises, but we just spent some time walking across the around and I have to recommend that as well. It was good taking our time looking at the carvings along the bridge and the detail in the sculptures was incredible.The view from the bridge of some other sights is great, and you can get some good pictures of the Eiffel Tower from there as well.It's obviously a popular spot for wedding photos as we saw three wedding parties posing during out time there.It's a quick stop on a tour of Paris, but it should be on the list."

The Pont Alexandre III is classified as a Historical Monument and there are no words basically to describe its outstanding beauty!It is just magnificent and lavish and you could spend a whole half-day studying and admiring its many gilded sculptures, statues and candelabras!The Pont Alexandre III links the Esplanade des Invalides to the Avenue Churchill that runs between the Grand Palais and Petit Palais and leads to the Champs Elysees.The metal bridge was built for the Universal Exhibition of 1900 and celebrated the Franco-Russian alliance that was sealed in August 1897.I recommend of course walking across the bridge to admire its wealth of decoration but you should also walk down on the riverbank to get a different perspective.You\u2019ll be able to admire the engineering work but also the many sculptures adorned the outside of the parapets.For example the two keystones placed on the centre of the bridge are adorned with sculptural groups facing the river.The upstream keystone\u2019s sculptural group represents the Nymphs of the River Seine, and the downstream the Nymphs of the River Neva.It is impossible to have a good look at these sculptures from atop the bridge!You need to do some homework before hand to spot the various decorative elements, but it\u2019s worth every minute spent reading your guidebook!The bridge is equally attractive at different time of the day, so you will go back over and over to take photos!The closest Metro stations are Invalides (Left Bank) or Champs Elysees Clemenceau (Right Bank) on Line 13.Whichever direction you come from, you'll enjoy a stunning view of the bridge as the metro exits are a couple of minutes away from the bridge."

Pont Alexandre was one of the places which I was not so keen on going as I have seen other bridges in European countries which I thought were the best. But then I am glad I reversed my decision and visited it. One of the most glamorous bridges I have ever seen is Pont Alexandre. The golden sculptures bordering the bridge make it glow at all times. The sprawling breadth of the bridge inspires awe. The passing cruises, ferries and boats gives you the cosmopolitan essence of the place from a strategic point. The sight of the Eiffel tower from here helps the Paris feeling really sink in. In short, \"Don't dare miss it\""

Beautiful bridge, no doubt, connecting beautiful buildings on one side of the river to equally beautiful buildings on the other. But ultimately it's just a bridge. There is no shade or shelter from rain and there aren't even places to eat nearby. Unlike the rest of Paris, where you can't swing a cat without hitting some kind of restaurant or food cart, the Pont Alexandre bridge area is a \"food desert.\" We learned this the hard way when we emerged from the super excellent \"Paris 1900\" exhibit at the Petit Palais needing lunch. We crossed the bridge imagining that of course there would be some charming bistro just on the other side. There wasn't. We had to walk at least 20 minutes to find someplace to eat. It did not help matters that it was 3pm, so the few places we did find were closed between lunch and dinner. Anyway, the bridge is great but it's JUST A BRIDGE. Look at it, cross it, but don't see it as an \"attraction.\""

Beautiful golden sculptures on top of the towers, with old-school Parisian lamps, and a lovely view of the Seine and the rest of Paris. My boyfriend and I stood on here one night, watching the waters undulate and the Eiffel tower sparkle in the night sky. Very romantic to walk across with a partner, but also very atmospheric and meditative for a lone stroll."

It was built towards the end of the 19th Cent. to mark the entente between France and Russia (initiated by Czar Alexander lll) that forced the entry of both France and Britain into WWl, and was completed in time for the Great Exhibition of 1900. Connecting the Grand and Petit Palais on the Right Bank with Les Invalides on the left, it boasts 4 large pillars crowned by gilt sculpture symbolizing the Fame of the Sciences, Arts, Industry and Commerce. At their bases are impressive stone sculptures depicting 4 Ages of French History: Renaissance, Contemporary, Charlemagne and Louis XlV. Symbolizing the entente, part of the coat of arms of Paris with two nymphs representing the Seine face the Eiffel Tower from the central span, while on the other side, the Russian coat of arms bears two nymphs representing the River Neva. As a quid pro quo, a similar bridge to mark the entente was constructed in St Petersburg (Trinity Bridge) by no less an architect than the great Gustave Eiffel himself."

At the end of the Champs-Elysees and very close to the Grand Palace and Military Museum (in fact in between these two places) you will find the bridge Pont Alexandre III. By metro this can be reached using the yellow line 7, either station Champs Elysees Clemenceau or Concorde and a short walk. Not being a bridge enthusiast I would not perhaps normally recommend visiting a bridge (although a few around the world do come to mind) but I would this one, particularly for couples or those taking the trek from the Arc de Triomphe all the way down to the Bastille. If taking this trek you will walk by anyway and it is well worth a quick visit and photo. It is beautifully made and home to tall columns with statues and sculptures around. It is also gives you a good view down the river and the Eiffel Tower in the background. For couples and those on romantic walks through Paris, then the views make this a welcome spot but also a must to be able to kiss underneath the bridge, blessing you with luck for a lifetime!Not a tremendous amount to see here but a lot in the area, so if you are here have a quick look and enjoy the lovely design of the bridge and its photo opportunities."

Pont Alexandre III is a declared monument in Paris that is probably the nicest bridge on the Seine and is well worth experiencing during trips to Paris. It was constructed between 1896 to 1900 and finished just in time for the Universal Exhibition held in Paris that same year. The bridge is named after Czar Alexandre III and is a testimony to the Art Nouveau style which was very much in favour during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It features lovely lamps, nymphs, cherubs as well as winged horses found at both ends of the bridge. Pont Alexandre III is a beautifully decorated bridge. Overall, It is a very nice bridge and something most will enjoy seeing when in Paris. While there are quite a few bridges linking the Left and Right Banks, this is the one that most memorable. As such, it is recommendable to experience Pont Alexandre III when in Paris."

It is so beautiful - impossible to take a bad photo of the bridge (or anywhere in Paris, or France, for that matter.)"

The gilded statues of the fames are eye-catching when looking up at them against the blue sky. They are just as beautiful at night with the bright lights shining on them, as well as the beautiful Art Nouveau street lamps that line it on both sides. The bridge is near the Grand Palais and the Quadriga statue (both on the right bank). It's pretty difficult to miss. I'd imagine you would have to drive over it, or near it at some point during your visit. No Paris night tour would be complete without a visit to this bridge."

There are candelabra type lamps that align both sides of the bridge and at night make this become one gigantic piece of illuminated artwork. Then looking along the sides of the bridge are more sculptures that give the illusion of this bridge being alive with the architecture's dreams. The Good: The amazing beauty of the sculptures and the architecture of this bridge.The Bad: Just be careful of the traffic it is a very busy bridge, with pedestrians and bicycles all looking at the bridge not for people.The Ugly: there are some people that just have to graffiti or scratch their initials into things.On the Scuba Bubble scale I give this bridge 8 out of 10 Bubbles."

Bridges in the world with this amount of ornamentation and stature are few. I can think of the Charles Bridge in Prague, St Angelo Bridge in Rome, and this Pont Alexandre III. Incidentally you can view these bridges and their surrounds in 3D on 3D City Explorer iPad App. Apart from the beautiful bronze sculpture and gold gilding etc. you also have some awesome views. Les Invalides, Eiffel Tower, Grand Palais and Petit Palais are all in full view from the bridge. One is almost tempted to pack some croissants and drinks and lay a blanket on the sidewalk and just take in this splendid area of Paris (there is a stretch of grass just nearby.)Regards, Ken (3dcityexplorer.com)"

The bridge would be worth seeing in its own right for its masonry, black metal ornamentation, heraldry and gilded statuary. However, this is complemented by its situation - to the north are the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais while to the south is the gilded dome of Les Invalides, above the tomb of Napoleon. Even my two sons said 'Wow!'. This was at dusk but the whole scene was even more impressive when we saw it - in bright sunshine, against a blue sky - from a Seine riverboat the following day."

With the Grand Palais in the background,the approach from Avenue du Marechal Gallieni is astounding. Why astounding? well,because the Pont with its exuberant Art Nouveau lamps,cherubs,nymphs,winged horses and a pack of lions at either end is testimony to visual and sensory gluttony. Yes,its arched,spanning the Seine,connecting the Champs-Elysees quarter with the Invalides and the Eiffel Tower quarter. I love this ornate,extravagant bridge,out of all the ones in Paris. Its classified as a historical monument,built in 1900 for the Universal Exhibition. The style of the Pont reflects that of the Grand Palais,to which it leads on the Right Bank. Whilst floating underneath on your Bateaux Mouche ride,you will notice the ceiling kissing your nose because the six-metre high single span steel arch was designed specifically not to obscure the views of the Champs -Elysees or the Invalides. Come at night,the lights blaze brightly and the vibe is fantastic,whilst you ruminate on how many movies were shot right where you are standing.James Bond,The Ronin,'Midnight in Paris',Angel-A and the animated Anastasia are just a sampling. You will also note that guarding the Pont,are four gilt-bronze statues of Fames,supported on massive 17 metre counterweights for the arch. the gilded sculptures on the masonry need to be explored and savoured slowly from below above and directly on. Its hypnotic draw will bring you back time after time,like an old love."

A single arch supports the bridge, unlike other bridges prior to its time. It is also painted with white and gilding, including figures on the columns that provide counterweights to the arch beneath. It was completed in 1900 and connects the Champs Elysees district to the Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides district near the Grand Palais."

Whether you see it from the road, travelling over it, or from the river passing underneath it, this has to be one of the most spectacular of Parisian bridges, with its wonderful sculpture, and gilt and green decorative scheme. It was designed and built for the Paris Exposition of 1900, and leads to the Grand and Petit Palaces and the Champs Elysees."

With its sweeping views of the Seine, art deco lampposts, cherubs, lions and the famous, towering Pegasus and Fames sculptures, it is possibly the most beautiful structure in central Paris, save perhaps for the nearby dome at the Tomb of Napoleon.

He showed us a painting he had recently made of Alexander Bridge, telling us it was Paris's most magnificent bridge. The bridge was honestly something my wife and I had overlooked, so we decided we should go back to that area and see it.Wow. I'm so glad we did. The detail on this bridge, the bright golds, the vibrant crowd, all made this an experience. I would recommend stopping by and seeing it. You could start with the Arc de Triomphe, walk down the Rue de Champs Elysees, pass the Grand and Petit Palais, right up to the bridge for a wonderful, romantic aftenroon stroll."

This bridge is of course truly amazing when you are right on it (and with great photo ops of the Eiffel Tower, although it's hard to pay attention to anything but the bridge). Named in honor of a Russian Czar, I somehow remember that it dates to Napoleonic times and that brief time when Napoleon and the Czar were good friends. It's got gilded everything and has to be the most over-the-top bridge I've ever seen.Passing underneath it on some type of boat excursion is also wondrous. There are these black, cream and gold wag decorations on the side, attempting to give it both glamour and a neoclassical style.Looking at it from Bridge de la Concorde (sp?) is another great view, the lights on the bridge look tiny, but they're actually quite adequately sized. Again, that view (from Concord) gives you the spire of the American Church in Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and the Trocadero (which gleams like the Acropolis in the distance) all in one shot. That's the bridge where Woody shot the opening frame of Midnight in Paris, capturing Pont Alexandre III from a distance, as if to say \"in Paris this sort of bridge is quite normal.\" And of course, it is. One gets so accustomed to various forms of architectural beauty in Paris that sometimes one doesn't stop to think about it.But, it's a must-see on any first visit to Paris and the walk to it (from Concord if you like or from Eiffel Tower) is worth it. Wandering back and forth over Parisien ponts can be a theme for an entire day..."

This review is intended to assist in basic security during your sightseeing walks around this immense city. There is a LOT of covert deceptive tricks being played on unwary tourists around here. 1) THE PETITION TRICK: Young, attractive, innocent looking Romanian teenagers may approach you asking you to sign a petition to support the handicapped and disabled. They usually operate in teams of two around the hottest tourist spots - below the Eiffel Tower, Champs-Elysees, Arc de Triomphe etc. DO NOT engage or sign this petition - it is a simple but effective scam. I watched several of these scams unfold as unwitting tourists signed the petition - and suddenly the girls change from nice to intensely demanding as you are now obliged to \"make a donation\" in support of the FAKE cause they pretend to represent. They purposely don't tell you how much you need to pay, so the confused and now embarrassed tourists open their wallets to ask which note they should pay (I am not making this up - I watched in disbelief at how many good hearted tourists fell prey to this), and the girls removed a 50 euro note, said sweetly \"thank you\", and continued onwards looking for their next victim. The tourist is left standing there stunned and unsure if they were just tricked, or, if they made a real and expensive donation. 2) THE FAKE GOLD RING TRICKSTER: A Parisian male walks past you and picks up a golden ring that is strangely at your feet. (You didn't see the first bit where he quietly dropped the ring at your feet without you seeing). He now presents the ring to you, and says in a smooth French accent, \"Is this yours? I just found it at your feet.\". Naturally you say \"No\". Well, the lovely Frenchman insists on sharing his good luck at finding a gold ring, and he hands it to you. Despite your protests, he is insistent you should have it - and he even points out the quality with the gold carat marking inside the ring band. He then walks away and then turns back moments later and suggests just maybe you could give him some Euros as a goodwill gesture. Once again, many tourists feel obliged - and hand over some money. The rings are completely worthless and fake. Sometimes the \"Ring Trickster\" has an accomplice who will also pick-pocket you, or your friends while you are being distracted by the generosity of a stranger handing you a gold ring.Enjoy your stay in this amazing city, and just be mindful to keep your valuables in a zipped up bag, that hangs on your front - not your back - so you can keep your eyes on it at all times. Safe journeys!"

The lovely orbed streetlights that line this bridge make it a very picturesque and romantic location, and it's no wonder that it regularly appears in movies and photos of the city. The best time to visit is just after sunset, during the \"blue hour\" where there is a blue cast of twilight over the city and the warm yellow lights are all starting to come on. There is a great view of the tower from here, making it a nice place to propose, as well. Unfortunately it is often crowded with tourists, so if you want the bridge to yourself, try stopping by early in the morning near sunrise."

You'll also remember it from the final scene from \"Midnight in Paris\".This is a wonderful bridge and an attraction in itself. While we were there it was being enjoyed by fellow tourists and brides having their wedding pictures taken. The ONLY problem is with the graffiti on a few spots. It didn't ruin the look of the whole bridge but it hadn't been cleaned up and was really pretty sad. But even with that, I loved the bridge and it's a must see."

There is no doubt the architecture in Paris is stunning; it's the reason millions of people visit the city each year; however, little of it is properly maintained or cared for, but this bridge is well-kept and worth a look, both for its beauty and its history."

But it's so beautiful, at night, on a rainy day, basking in the sun, the view of it, the view from it...It's what you will see in every movie that is even partly set in Paris. The detail work on every statue, every lamp post is amazing...And it's kind of half way between Louvre and Eiffel Tower so if you're walking your way through your Paris visit make sure you cross the river here. One of my favourite spots in Paris (and yes, I know, it's a clich\u00e9 and such a touristy thing to say, but I don't care)."

The bridge is worth seeing alone but it also connects the Grand and Petit Palais' to the Hotel des Invalides. In fact, if you are visiting Hotel des Invalides and have the time, start your visit at this bridge and approach from the north."

I was impressed by the guilded accents on many of the statues and magnificent lamposts. Great spot for the photographer! It got hot walking across in the mid day sun and I would suggest either early morning or evening for better lighting for more serious photographers. This bridge is specatcular illuminated at night!!!"

Make sure you check out where this bridge is in Paris, as highly likely if you are sightseeing you will be walking very near it due to its proximity to many of the other tourist attractions. It's by far the prettiest and most ornate bridge in the city. It's got some great views of the Eiffel Tower, the statues and lamps are amazing and the back drop on either side (Hotel des Invalides and Grand Palais), is stunning.Even if you don't need to cross to the other side, it will only take you a few mins to wonder over and then wonder back and carry on with your journey. I'd highly recommend you do this and you will get some great pictures from here"

I traveled to Paris on March 10 of this year because it was the first anniversary my wife's death, and Paris was her favourite city. My visit was a visit of remembrance and although she loved all of the museums there, her favourite spot in all of Paris was the Pont Alexandre III Bridge. After our anniversary visit in 1989, on all of our seven subsequent visits to the city, that bridge was where we had to go. We would get up very early and leave the hotel before most of the guests were up. She wanted to watch the rising sun reflected off the gold highlights of the bridge. Before I left England this time, I bought six white roses. The florist removed the petals with great care and placed them in a small box that I carried to Paris. On the morning of the 12th, with the bridge almost deserted, I walked to the centre gold relief, past the decorative lamps, with the golden dome of Invalides in the distance, and dropped the petals into the river. Is there a more reverent way to celebrate the joyous memories in a life than to travel to the place in all the world that made them most happy? I knew that on that chilly morning with the wind passing over the water, that my wife was near and happy."

It's very ornate with bronze statues of sea nymphs that attracted my camera like magnets. There are golden rearing horses at each side and end of the bridge. Even the lighting is extravagant and chances are pretty good most people have seen Pont Alexandre III in the movies without perhaps realizing it. The bridge leads head-on to Place des Invalides where Napoleon I is interred. After tearing ourselves away we agreed yet another marvellous attraction should be added to the multitudinous offerings of Paris: Pont Alexandre III."
