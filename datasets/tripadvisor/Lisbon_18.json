This is such a lovely walk, with interesting shops, cute little places to eat and stop for a wine (and some of that yummy local runny cheese and fresh bread!). The tessellated tiles are just beautiful, however I've head the local municipality want to rip them up as they are too high maintenance). This town is made for strolling and you will definitely enjoy a walk down to the harbour."

The Praca do Comercio is a sunny happy square bordering the waterfront of the Tagus and surrounded by three elegant arcaded ochre and white buildings that used to be the palace designed by Pombal. Although no longer the gateway to Lisbon, it is now a buzzing trendy location for tourists and locals where street musicians and seagulls abound. The magestic triumphal arch leads into the city. In the center of the square is a huge statue of King Jose I. Inside the arcaded passage is a very helpful tourist information office."

The square is right to the shore and you are almost certain to find an ad-hoc fiesta next to the river. Street musicians, people who feel like dancing and nice places offering a wine or cocktails to enjoy along with a sunset over the river, they're all two steps away. The arch is impressive and the square it's said to be the place where the medieval ships would come to and bring spices and other exotic goods from overseas."

However from a content standpoint it is sadly much like any other tourist centre. Lots of shops/big brands and every 15 metres a small Asian tourist shop selling exactly the same tat as the one 15 metres either side of it, which really spoil the whole place. The whole of Lisbon is sadly blighted by these. No innovation no differential it is a pity the Council let it happen. The centre of the walkway is full of restaurants which offer a variety of cuisine, lots of local and very typical dishes which is good. Fish a plenty alongside cheeses and meat dishes.In the evening it can be like an assault course dodging all the menu guys but at least it feels safe and is well lit."

A large square with about 35.000 sq metres, its the perfect gateway between Lisbon downtown and Tagus river.The former location of a Royal Palace, it was completely destroyed by 1755 Lisbon earthquake, after which it was rebuild as part of the Lisbon downtown rebuilding plan of Marquis of Pombal, Minister of the Kingdom during the reign of Dom Jos\u00e9 I.Walking down Augusta Street, you enter Pra\u00e7a do Comercio through Augusta Street Arch and end up in the Tagus River port, from where caravels would arrive to unload and trade their goods. From that standpoint, this square also worked as the Kingdom customs.An historical curiosity, it was in this square that the last King of Portugal, Dom Carlos I, was assassinated in February 1st, 1908."

The local name is Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o which is a reference to the royal palace which stood on the same land before the earthquake. Although a must see in Lisbon don't expect it to be a bustling square, though I understand it comes into its own when it hosts specific events. The restaurants/bars around the square are overpriced and best avoided. Plenty of nice places to eat and drink in the streets parallel to Rua Augusta. Places you must visit while at the square are the Tagus riverbank, Arco Triunfal da Rua Augusta (you can actually climb up to the top of it to take in the superb views) and Lisboa Story Centre (a multimedia/audiovisual museum which tells the story of city through the ages). We saw a small artisan's craft market here on the Monday and Tuesday during our stay. You can get the metro, buses, trams and taxis here."

You'll find shops and commercial spaces in this area like lots of souvenir shops and restaurants. When I went there , it is just so lively. A lot of people, locals and tourists are crossing the streets. The server on the restaurant I dined in, was so polite and even gave me a friendly reminder to keep my bags always in the front as he said it is dangerous at night time. Then I noticed everyone really have their bags in front of them even the backpacks. What I didn't like as I said there were a lot of people in the area, was some guys approached me asked if I want to buy Marijuana. Woah! Surprised me but I said no and they left me. Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay in Lisbon."

It is still known as ' The Palace Yard' (Terreiro do Paco) because before the 1755 Lisbon earthquake it was the location of the Royal Ribeira Palace. King Manuel I built the Royal residence by the river outside the city walls. A Port was also in the area and administrative buildings that regulated trade between Portugal and it's colonies in Africa, Asia, Brazil and Europe. In 1755 the deadly earthquake, tsunami and consuming fire destroyed the Ribeira Palace, the buildings near the Tagus river and two thirds of the city of Lisbon, killing in excess of 90,000 people. It was a Calamity that set the fortunes of Lisbon back with the loss of many art treasures and books of the Palace Libraries. The Prime minister Marquis of Pombal under King Jose I press ganged Lisbon' survivors to rebuild the broken city. The Square was named Praca do Comercio to reinvent the new function of the square in relation to the commercial heritage of Lisbon and Portugal. In the centre ofthe square is an imposing Statue of King Jose I. The sculpture was worked by Machado de Castro of Coimbra. Maxhado was a master of many sculptures. The particular sculpture of the Square shows King Jose I on his horse crushing snakes on his path."

The Portuguese capital has a new venue for enjoying the city, P\u00e1tio da Gal\u00e9, in Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o, featuring areas dedicated to food & beverage, leisure, culture and events.Situated in the west wing of Lisboa's most emblematic square, P\u00e1tio da Gal\u00e9 helps to promote the charm of the Portuguese capital as a tourist destination, presenting itself as an ideal place to experience the city.Like every Europeam capital, (Concord Paris, Grand Place Belgium etc) Lisbon has its grand circles. Pra\u00e7o do Comercio is the one in Lisbon. Inside Patio da Gale, thereare two restaurants - the Aura and the Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o. There are also terraces, icecream parlour, exhibitions and cultural events around. It is a big circle and beautiful summer nites there is a big screen TV. It was time of Eurocup, was excellent place to watch the final with France. From time to time there is also stage and live music. The best thing about the place is it is by the Tejo river, you can walk along the bank, or sit by the river. It is a good bank for promenade there are cafes that sell snacks and drink along the way. If you walk like 10-15 minutes you can reach Cas de Sodre train station from where you can take the train to the most popular summer towns of Lisbon: Estoril and Cascais. Along the way, the estuary of river Tejo ends where the train follows the route by the Atlantic. Cascais is the terminal a town worth seeing and visiting for a day to pass at the shores of Atlantic Ocean."

Praca do Comercio, also referred to as Palace Square is a large open plaza in the south side of the city along the bay near the mouth of the Tagus River. This was the site of the Royal Palace until it was relocated to Sao Jorge in the early 16th century. At that time, the area became the gateway to Lisbon for those arriving by sea and a location of commercial and state activity. Today, you can see symmetric and arcaded buildings on the north, east and west sides of Praca do Comercio, these are painted yellow and are quite attractive. Amongst the buildings are a handful of restaurants with alfresco seating. We found a open market with falls selling handmade goods and other interesting items in the arcades along the north side of the plaza during our visit. Not sure if this is held year round or only for summer months. There are also a couple of museum attractions; Museum of Lisbon: Torreao Poente and the Story of Lisbon and a centre monument to King Jose I which is quite attractive to view. The Arco de Rua Augusta monument on the north end of the square is also a rather appealing structure worth viewing while you are at Praca do Comercio.During our visit, the large plaza was hosting a EURO 2016 event, with large screen TV, seating, foosball and Carlsberg stands for those interested in watching tournament games. This was a great way to spend some time at Praca do Comercio, for football fans and general tourists alike. Note: You can visit Praca do Comercio conveniently by walking down Rua Augusta or by way of several trams that stop here while transversing across Lisbon."

The atmosphere created by the presence of the numerous tourists has a, well, touristic feel to it. There are shops and many outdoor restaurants on this and parallel streets. Sadly, the food is mostly unimpressive, with the typical, very ordinary Portuguese fare showing little variation amongst the establishments. If you can find a place that serves Cataplana (seafood) and if they happen to do it reasonably well, you will have something noteworthy. Otherwise, my own preference is to stick with grilled fish, as this rarely fails. Caldeirada can also be good, whereas EVERY seafood rice I've ever had came watery, and nowhere near what one should expect given the description. But I digress...At the end of the street you are at a very large square - Praca do Comercio, where you can take some reasonable photos. Immediately on the other side of the square you are by the water, where people congregate just to hang out a bit. When the water level permits, some souls take to the mini beach thus exposed and wet their feet to cool off a bit.There is nothing strikingly remarkable about the entire walk, but as a tourist it is something you should see, as it does reflect some of what makes this country what it is/was."

Some decades ago, if you arrived in Lisbon by boat, this was the grand entry into the city: it was called the Quay of the Columns and so much happened there. People should try to look at old paintings or photographs to understand its grandeur, a plaza completely opened to the river and to reflect the sun's light, as in a mirror, from the white buildings around. Today it's a place where you can sit and enjoy a drink or quick bite in any of the restaurants which are a recent development. Nevertheless, S. Martinho in the Arcade is a restaurant that belongs to an older Lisbon and tells stories of writers and artists who frequented it. Not to be missed, if you enjoy knowing about wine, the place, on the right hand of the Arcades (facing the river), where you can buy a card and taste,inexpensively, some top wines directly from the producers."

Summer nights are specially great when frequently concerts are held here. Also its the beating heart of the city, surrounded by downtown, the riverside, great shops and restaurants..its a must in lisbon! A refreshing beer or a white wine by the glass in the end of a summer day is precious :) recomend especially the Populi restaurant and Can the Can. Now, before that, one unforgetable view is the one from the top of the arch. It's well worth the ticket as from here you have a true panoramic view. And do bring your camera!"

Arriving via ship, you will pass the tower of Belem, a symbol of Portuguese exploration and the Cristo Rei ( a replica of the Christ the King Statue in Rio).The public Square is on the river Tagus. Explorers left from here on heroic voyages of discovery. The square is fronted by the river, framed on two sides by official buildings, and on the fourth the arch that serves as the gateway to the old city. From the square, you look upon the hills that Lisbon was built upon. Castillo de Sao Jorge, located on a hilltop overlooking the city should be visited (allow at least one hour). Entering via the Arch, you are in the old city center surrounded by buildings that have survived for centuries. This is the nerve center of the old city, now converted to shops, offices and other commerce. Get a map, walk the streets, take the Santa JustaLift to the upper areas of the city and explore. Visit the historic churches, public squares and museums. A few days in Lisbon will bring history alive!"

So my wife and the children decided to call it a day and go back to the ship, leaving me loose on my own in Lisbon.The irony is that, having climbed to the castle and then back down to the centre of town, I found the Main Street, the grand archway leading to this large and dramatic square on the waterfront. Irony because wheelchair access couldn't be easier.It's a very grand square with the centre statue, surrounding buildings no archways, and a great vista out across the water. Just beyond the archway (back the way I came in) is a pedestrianised area with all the main shops and some great things to see.This square was a bit of a highlight in Lisbon for me."

You can pick up local buses/trams and other tourists transportation here. The 15E tram to Belem can be pick up here. You can also take the main street at the back of the statue and it would lead to Rossio Train station where you can get the Train to Sintra, about 1 hour or so away. In Sintra you can visit the PalaceWe were on a cruise ship that docked in Lisbon at Santa Apolonia terminal. This is over an hour's tram/bus ride to Belem. However, it is very easy to get there by bus/tram or train. So, exit the Port, go left and walk along the waters edge until you get to Praca de Comercio Square, one of Lisbon's main square. The square is on your right. Praca de Comercio is also called Terreiro do Paco. It is about an 8-10 min walk. It is a stopping point for buses and trams etc.Look for the stop for Tram #15E, should be ahead to the left. We paid 2.85Euros each way per person. You can buy the ticket on the Tram from the machine, which takes coins and notes. The machine gives change. Or you can buy it at a Metro station before you get on the Tram. The 15E to Belem would say \"ALGES\" because that is the last stop, but Belem is before this, about the 13th stop. The tram stops right in front of the Monastery, so you will know when you are in Belem.You can also take Bus #728, which I think is about 2 streets over in front of Apolonia cruise terminal. Look for the 728 going in the same direction you would have to walk to get to the square. If you take the bus you just sit on it until it arrives in Belem. It would also pick up passengers on its way at Praca de Comercio Square.On the way back we took Bus # 728, across the street from the Monastery. The cost was less than the Tram...1.80Euros each. You can buy on the bus. We got off at Praca de Comercio and walked around to see Lisbon's city centre. It takes a different route, passing the the Alcantara Mar & Cais Sodre Train station. We saw different things on the way back."

Walk from here through the clock town entrance area down the (walking) tourist street. I recommend you stop to ask the outdoor vendor selling tile replicas what the symbols and meanings are of the tiles. He gave us a nice history of the earthquake, tsunami, and fire in the tiles. (see photos)BEWARE! I suggest you ask someone in advance about good authentic restaurants! There were plenty of imitation places around. Had several bad meals.Don't eat where the tourists walk. I especially don't suggest you buy a meal at the Praca do Comercio. Quite possibly the worse fish meal I've ever had. I can't find the name of that restaurant online-they've good reason to stay of Google maps... but it was smack dab in the middle of the outdoor seating. If you want to enjoy the sun in this area, buy a coffee or go with Italian!"

Several of the streets that go that way are pedestrian only. The buildings all reflect the style of the period (second half of 1700). It is really worthwhile.The Praca do Comercio (Trade Square because of the fairs that was held there for many years) is surrounded by historical buildings hosting many of the Portuguese Ministries - this square, until the earthquake hosted the Palace of the king and its government (this is why also the name Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o - meaning Courtyard - the yard of the court of the king).The square opens up to a magnificent view of the Tagus estuary."

My boyfriend and I were approached literally 4 times by different dealers in under a minute while walking across the square. They are quite insistent and get uncomfortably close or even touch you. I had to elbow one guy to get him away from me at which point he started yelling at me and asking what my problem was. There seems to be no police presence whatsoever, which is really disappointing as it seems like a minimal amount of effort on their part could substantially curtail the practice and make it a more pleasant place. As it was, the whole area had an unfortunately seedy and unsafe vibe, so I cannot recommend it for persons traveling alone or with children. At most I'd recommend stopping very quickly for a couple photos and then leaving immediately. Such a shame."

It was built after the earthquake of 1755 as part of the rebuilding effort of Lisbon under Marquis de Pombal, the prime minister of Jose I whose monumental equestrian statue stands in the middle of the plaza. Also Praca do Comercio was the scene of assassination of King Carlos I in 1908."

International food fare on every corner. This is awesome whether you are alone or with a family. The shopping is amazing especially if you are into high end goods as it less then rest of Europe. Know your prices and be ready to shop. Don't miss bringing back Port. It's very little known for me, but once there I found out there are tons that never make the world wide market so try taste tasting and don't just dive into whatever is being peddled as some are smoother and sweeter and unless you know all this by self education, you will shop poorly. Women, don't drag a large purse. Crowds are huge and pick pocketing is infamous here. Spread money into various pockets and take a very small hand clutch.

All of the cities have a big Plaza, however not even one is open to the river, and just because of that this is one of the most beautiful Plazas of the world.One open front to the river Tagus, and on the other three sides, XVIII century buildings with restaurants and a very good museum, with the singular light of Lisbon, what do you want more!!!"

If you want to truly appreciate the Marques de Pombal's vision for Lisbon you need to take time out in this magnificent square and if it reminds you of Washington, Paris or bits of London then it is no accident. Architecturally this belongs to cosmopolitan 18th century Northern Europe not the Mediterranean/Moorish tradition. It's a great place just to sit with a glass of something and watch people pass by. Or take part in the meny public entertainments staged here. Hard to believe when looking at this expanse of stone work that it used to be a royal park, then for many years a car park."

Also if you want you can go up inside that Arch from Augusta Street we got in the middle of the square, that has an elevator who will take you up to a breathtaking view.. And i'm sure you won't miss it. The tickets to go upstairs are sold when u cross the Arch and go immediately to your right side. If you are fun of shopping you go straight ahead in that street and you will find several stores, coffees, our Downtown city area.If you come from cruises that have the pier near Sta Apol\u00f3nia, you can reach this area, walking to your left for about 20 minutes. Its better to go by the street inside, that takes you there easily, then going in the main street full of traffic. You can also take a tuck tuck there, as its too much close to go by taxi. If you have any free transfer from the port, go ahead! Have fun !!!"

The Praca do Comercio is a wonderful, central starting point / meeting place, and is also an AMAZING photographers focal point!Located on the shore of the wide and expansive Tagus River,The Praca do Comercio is a wide open public square - surrounded on three sides by historic building and amazing architecture. With the arched portico's of the buildings are a collection of restaurants, cafes, a few shops, museums, and points of interest. Most of the restaurants have extensive out door cafe/ seating areas, for that you could literally spend hours people / tourist watching and viewing a ton of activities taking place in the central square.The centre piece of the square is a larger than life bronze statue of King Jose the 1st on mount (on horse back) which itself proves to be a major and dramatic focal point for photography. The building and architecture that surround the square add dramatic backdrops to the statue and to the surroundings. On the north side of the square - opposite the river - there is a large and dramatic triumphal arch 'Arco da Rua Augusta' - itself worth more than a few pictures - through which leads you onto Augusta Street - a wide pedistrian outdoor shopping area called the Rossio. Here and for seveal amazing blocks, you will find amazing shops, shopping, restaurants (many again with outdoor cafe seating areas in the centre of the pedestrian paths), street entertains, and many locals and tourists alike - out for a quiet evenings stroll.On Saturdays and Sundays there is a very nice, high quality craft / artist market under the arches of the north building.The square - primarily right in front of the archway (Arco da Rua Augusta) also seems to serve a very convenient central hub for a variety a public transport opportunity - buses, trams, cabs / taxis, tuc tuc's, bicycles, and even segways. The square was obviously a feature stop for many tourist tour groups, and not far way along the river's edge to the east, several major international cruise ships were docked.This amazing square provides a starting point to explore many nearby neighbourhoods, sites, and attractions not to be missed.In planning our 1st and unfortunately brief stay in Lisbon, I did extensive research on accommodations and ended up booking an amazing 5th floor penthouse apartment through AIR BNB that was only one block away from the Praca do Comercio. AND I truly specifically booked this apartment because of it's proximity and view right onto the square and access to Augusta St. and the Rossio area - truly the central heart of old historic central Lisbon - steps from major 'must do' sites and to the waterfront.TIPS: For an amazing experience, and to get a genuine feeling of old world Lisbon and true sense of real living, stay in the old town central core if possible. We found that the location of our totally private and self contained rental apartment (again not what we know or expect as a bed and breakfast property in North America) was more than perfect in creating an amazing experience. We were steps away for amazing sites, shopping, genuine neighbourhoods, amazing street and alleyway with amazing shops and restaurants around each corner, and an amazing church or cathedral on almost every block. We were one block away from the waterfront, several blocks from the castle, a short interesting walk from the massive Saturday outdoor flea market, and tons of other things to see and do.DO NOT MISS the convent ruins, and the elevated / elevator tower.Can not wait to return!!!"

Maybe it's because winter is coming, or maybe the civic authorities like the expansive monumental look, but it was surprising how little activity there was to be seen on the square. No buskers, no living statues, no stalls of any kind. So a stroll around and hot chocolate was the sum total of the time we devoted to it."

The arms of the \"U\" end in two large towers (The east tower finished in the 19th century) In the Northside of the Square, facing Rua Augusta, there was the Arco da Rua Augusta ( Triumphal Arch ), started in 1759 and completed in 1873. The square was named Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio (The Square of Commerce). The Commerce Square was filled with government bureaus that regulated customs and port activities. In the center of the square, there was the equestrian statue of King Jos\u00e9 I, inaugurated in 1775. (King Jos\u00e9 I faced once the main maritime entrance to Lisbon.)

The view back toward the city includes imposing statuary and the arch over Rua Augusta, as well as the impressive buildings facing the square. Look toward the river and you'll see probably see birds, various harbor boats (both working vessels and tour boats), a cruise ship or two, and, at a distance, the Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge and the Cristo Rei monument. There will be also be street musicians playing for you, and you can get also get tourist information or stop for a drink or something to eat. Because of the size of the square, a lot of people can enjoy it at once without getting in each other's way. When you get tired of people watching or tired of enjoying the river breeze, you can catch a tram from there to continue your sightseeing (catch Tram 15 from there to go to Belem). One sight I viewed at this square is probably something you won't see: one morning we watched dozens of young men and women wearing only flip flops and what appeared to be flesh-colored underwear. They were performing some actions to the direction of someone shouting orders. They periodically were given towels to put on and take off. In a city of sights ranging from the Tower of Belem to the Castelo de Sao Jorge, this outdoor activity was certainly unique. Visit this wonderful square, linger a while, and maybe you'll see something equally intriguing."

I don't think they are dangerous just more of a nuisance when you may have come here to get some quiet time to yourself.

There are some nice pastry shops nearby and is obviously the centre for Portuguese banks (they are everywhere). However, we stayed in the area and went there again at night. There are gangs of drug dealers openly selling anything from cannabis to crack cocaine in the street. We saw a police car once, when they all disappeared, but five minutes later they were back. We were asked by different individuals about 12 times if we wanted anything. Not a nice thing to see, something I have never encountered in larger cities like London or Rome."

A vast maw of nothing set in between some pretty standard buildings with a lonely statue sat in the middle looking almost lost amongst the sea of tourists and drug dealers. Oh by the way, I forgot to mention. This area of Lisbon is pretty much a 1 to 1 ration between normal people and drug dealers. They make no effort to hide their pushing. They literally just come up to you with Class A drugs in their hands and openly ask you if you want to buy drugs. In one 15 minute period of walking around the Baixa I was offered drugs on no less than 8 different occasions. At first it was a bit scary, then it became annoying, finally it became downright frustrating. It was such a problem after a while that it actually put us off going to this area of the centre. Its not a once in a while thing either. Other people were similarly getting harassed by these peddlers within plain sight of Police officers who really don't seem to care.Bottom line is; this is an ok but average area. Its not massively intriguing as it lost most of its very historic buildings in the 18th century earthquake and was rebuilt on a fairly sanitised grid pattern. Its one of those places in Lisbon you have to see just because of where it is but if it was anywhere else it really wouldn't be worth the trip. After a couple of evenings walking around we used it solely as a place to get on and off trams or buses while heading to or from the much prettier and safer neighbourhoods of Alfama and Bairro Alto. Another thing many people have said is to be wary of pickpockets too. Certainly better in the day than the night."

Formerly a huge parking lot (fortunately no longer the case), the square sits on the edge of the Tagus and anchors what is possibly the only significant stretch of flat land in the city (no small thing if, like my wife and me, your knees aren't what they used to be). You can find the main visitor information center in the northwest corner, the best reason this should be your first stop. Inside, a very helpful lady named Sandra gave us some spot on advice about what to see--and not see--in Lisbon.The praca (the word is the Portuguese equivalent of piazza, place, platz, plaza, etc) is also a transportion terminus where several bus and tram lines converge.Pass under the arch to the rua Augusta, a very nice pedestrian-only street of shops and restaurants."

You can get from most part of the city to Praca do Comercio by taking the metro blue line and getting off at Baixa-Chiado station. This square, however, is unlike other European squares in that it's not a 'commercial' in the sense of having a lot of shops, restaurants and cafe. One one side is the Targus river, the opposite side of the square is dominated by the Victory Gate. The remaining two sides have tourist information office and cafes on one side and the newish Lisboa Story Centre on the other. Smack in the middle of the square is a stature of a former king astride a horse. If you come to this square, you should visit the Lisboa Story Centre to get a historical perspective of the city. One can get a real feel for the 1775 earthquake which decimated the city and most of its population in this museum. For an extra Euro, you can also get a ticket to the top of the Victory Gate. The latter provides an expansive view of the river and the city. From here you can observe the grid pattern of the surrounding streets, rebuilt from scratch after the devastation of the earthquake. I would not make this a 'must see' destination in Lisbon if I have only 1 or 2 days in the city. However, for any stays longer than 2 days, it's definitely worth a visit."

In the middle you have Dom Jos\u00e9 Statue, one of Portugal kings.Behind the square you have a beautiful view of the city erasing where you may see the S\u00e9, Saint George Castle, Carmo Convent among others.In the arcades sometimes, on the weekend, there is an handicraft fair. And by the sides there is restaurants with lovely esplanades to enjoy.(There's also here a public wc that you can use for 1\u20ac - The best wc in town :-)In August there is a light show projected in the buildings and Arc at night (dates are not the same from year to year).

England went out pretty quickly, and Portugal weren't far behind them. Nevertheless the Lisbanos were determined to party. There had been a music festival outside our hotel the night before, in Martim Moniz, and this day they were setting up a giant outdoor TV screen in Comercio for a football match and another pop concert.Behind the restaurants and quite hidden are a couple of museums. The Lisbon Story was an entertaining couple of hours, with headphones and dioramas, and a little movie of the earthquake, which really set up another day when we saw the view from the Law Courts down through the Parque Eduardo VII, across Marques Pombal and down Av. de Liberdade to the Baixa, and we could imagine what the earthquake would have been like.There is also a Beer museum next to the Lisbon Story, and I was sorry we didn't have time for it. Still, have to leave some things for our next visit."

Although the area is worth a visit and Lisbon is great, I had the feeling that I was wandering through a suburb in the tenth biggest city of France/Spain/Italy. The streets were dull with just uninteresting shops, restaurants and hotels. And not to forget, gift shops with countless useless rubbish. I hate to say this, but after seeing a few you have seen them all because they all seem to sell the same rooster statues, plates and magnets. I hardly didn't get a chance to get a glimpse on the magnets that were usually displayed outside because the vendors jump you immediately and harass you with pushy remarks. If that wasn't bad enough, the merchandise is overpriced and hardly what you are looking for. I have tried to buy a souvenir oven glove and it was poor quality, probably fake too, I could still feel oven heat when I used it. T-shirts and football jerseys were poor imitations and never the real sizes it claimed to be. Large sizes never fit me and even the XXL were tight. I am not even a hulking or chubby tall man, so if I can't fit a XXL then who can? Is this a prank? Not to mention the very aggressive waiters that lurk in streets to harass virtually every passer-by they can see. I have spend an unusual amount of time in Lisbon and in 45 days I was almost harassed at least ten times. Inevitably it began to become such an ordeal that I started to avoid walking slash staying there. Watch out for beggars who are also on the alcantara viewpoint, but it has occurred to me a couple of times that they hang around Rossio station with nonsense made up stories. Walking around in the streets of Lisbon is quite a bit of chore on your feet because all of the city seems to have cobble-tiled sidewalks which are bumpy and have a lot of dips and sometimes cobbles missing. After a while I was starting to get blisters and then even extra socks or insoles didn't help anymore. Although Lisbon drivers are very patient and nice to pedestrians, the traffic is intense and it doesn't help a lot that most streets in this area are still made of brick which amplifies the loud noise of rolling rubber. If I may give you one last tip, don't try to remember any names of the streets, forget about it. The street signs are usually high on the walls and for some inconceivable reason have white boards with white letters on them, which to me are very difficult to read. And why is it always names like Rua Santo Antonia dos Capouchos or R.Antonio Maria Cordosa. Try to get familiar with the area to get around, that is way better than trying to search for the street names."

Built on the designs of the Marquis de Pombal when Lisbon was rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake, it is I think one of the great squares in the world. Open on one side to the Tagus estuary, it is an immense square in a sober late baroque style, crowned by a triumphal arch. It is surrounded by the hills to which Lisbon climbs. The Sao Jorge fortress and the cathedral are on its Eastern side.Coloured in egg yolk yellow and blonde sandstone, it changes looks all day long, and it is a wonderful place at sunset. Lots of nice bars and restaurants."

Street musicians always seem to be playing, and there vendors will sell you anything from an umbrella to sunglasses - one enterprising vendor noted that I was wearing prescription glasses, and immediately produced a pair of clip-on glasses to tempt me to buy!!You can catch a tram or bus at the top of the square, and there's a metro stop close by, on the river front. You can also go up to the top of the monumental archway for great views out over the river. The shopping centre is just behind the square, through the archway and is a mixture of pedestrian streets, and those allowing traffic. This area is popular with \"living statues\" which I find fascinating - how do they manage to stay so still and balance without wobbles?!Just a word of warning, it's a busy place and pick-pockets are known to operate here - keep valuables out of sight and hold tight to your bags. You'll also find quite a few beggars, some of whom pretend to be physically handicapped, we saw one of them walking normally until he saw a potential donor. I'm sure some of them are genuine but just be aware what happens.This is one of the first places you will see if you arrive by cruise ship and walk up from the cruise terminal - don't bother with the shuttle bus, just head along the river front, it's quicker than the bus and a great introduction to a very vibrant city!"

This is a historical reference, as between the 16th and the 18th centuries, it housed the Portuguese crown's royal palace, known as \"Pa\u00e7o da Ribeira\". The 1755 earthquake destroyed completely the palace and its famous library. \"Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio\", with its yellow buildings and beautiful arcades, was built shortly after the earthquake, as part of the heroic efforts of the Marquis of Pombal to reconstruct the city. This magnificent square, considered one of the largest \"plazas\" of Europe, is sided by the \"Rio Tejo\" (Tagus River) and its iconic and noble \"Cais das Colunas\" (Columns Quay), where all important guests disembarked from their vessels. On the northern side, the fantastic \"Arco Triunfal da Rua Augusta\", an imposing arch meaning the entrance of the so called quarter of \"Baixa Pombalina\". At the center of \"Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio\", an equestrian statue of King D. Jos\u00e9 I, who commanded its construction. Its name - \"Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio\" - was chosen in order to honor those that heavily contributed to Lisbon's rebirth after the earthquake: the traders! Today, department offices occupy the yellow buildings and, under the arcades, restaurants, caf\u00e9s and souvenir shops are tourist's deligths. The \"Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio\" is indeed Lisbon's \"Plaza Mayor\"! A monumental square complex that cannot be missed by all those visiting Lisbon! One last remark: evening visits at your own risk. Enjoy!"

There are a couple disturbing things going on. One they have a lot of people begging money, some are missing limbs or having some other conditions. Second, there are a lot of guys offering to sell you drugs on the street. After talking to the locals, it appears that a lot of these \"drugs\" are actually fake or the dealers will report you to police so they can extract some money from the people who decide to try to buy. So it's an enjoyable place, just use your common sense and stay away from the troubles."

They're a lot expensive because of the touristy area."

The city suffered a major earthquake centuries ago on All Saints' Day, and virtually everyone was in one of the many stone churches. Portugal is primarily Catholic. As they fled, stones dropping as the ran, they headed for Commercial Square because it was a large open space with only the arch. But as they stood on the vast plaza, a tsunami formed on the river and most all were swept away. A point to remember: Lisbon is best seen with a native Portugese guide, who is full of stories and legends."

Lisbon was our last port of call on a P and O cruise.On our way in,we went under the Tagus Bridge and because the bridge is made of metalwork,it enables ships passengers,to see the underside of any cars going over the bridge,and also hear a strange buzzing noise as it passes under.At the end of the bridge is a vast statue of Christ,similar to the one in Rio deJanerio.We got a shuttle bus, which dropped us off at the main shopping square and walked down towards the Triumphal Arch.Here leads through to a massive square ,where you can get buses or trams,and also there is a large black horse statue here, also refreshments. Back up the shopping area,where we saw street sellers,huge bubble blowers,beggars,men trying to sell you sunglasses,and an old lady that was blind, sat singing for a pittance. To the left ,going upwards, on a side street is the very old iron lift, which takes you to the upper level, where all the restuarants are.What i liked best ,was the old mosaics on the front of most of the buildings,some of them were stunning. Also the pavements were made of black and white patterned mosaics.At the top of the hill is St. George Castle,where you can walk round the walls and see cannons and telescopes for views over the city.Really liked Lisbon and would like to return."

I stumbled across this big pocket of an open planned brilliant white stoned floor which magnificently reflected the sun\u2019s rays right back at me. Walking through Alfama, this area is located on the straight road that runs by the harbour and what a gem it is. The huge square (Patio da Gale) has a centre piece with a tall statue however the steps located right under it are not clean and actually very dirty, so wouldn\u2019t recommend sitting there. There were a few large groups enjoying the open space and restaurants that are lined on the perimeter of this square. The best part however is the steps located near the ocean that allows people to sit and look at the waves right by your feet! Casually glaring at the huge cruise liners in the distant waves provides a relaxing chill. I even managed to doze off for a little bit! Obviously, once again be aware of pit-pockets and the street sellers who can be quite aggressive. Otherwise, for a sunny Saturday this was a lovely pit-stop before venturing further into the Alfama district. There is a metro Station located within the perimeter of the square and trams circle around, therefore transport is plentiful. Here is also the building gate that begins the long road of \u2018Rua Augusta\u2019. I strongly recommend going from Praca do Comercio through to Rua Augusta, as it sets you up perfectly for the full Alfama experience. \u2018Rua Augusta\u2019 is another lively market littered road, with all sorts of food/shops/tourist features so be sure to add this to your itinerary."

Lots of caf\u00e9s, the several ministeries, some empty.The central black horse monument still covered.

Two of the other sides are composed of dignified colonnades giving shelter to cafes and restaurants, but also to street traders so numerous as to meet the definition of a market, giving colour and vibrance to the grayish surroundings. The centre is occupied by a handsome equestrian statue of Jose 1, and there is other triumphal sculpture that visitors will want to convert to digital images.

Even with the construction work that was going on in March you were rewarded with grand views of the castle and Cristo Rei across the Tagus. The triumphal arch is dramatic as the building it graces serves as the perfect frame. People are attracted to the statue in the middle and come to sit and talk. This is probably the 2nd best place to people watch after Rossio Square."

But, one can not complain when it is open and clean at all times. And, once to watch the beginning of the segway tours. We have taken segway tours in the past so we know about the learning curve. it was a hoot watching others get the hang of it. There are also a couple of cafes on the Praca with tables and umbrellas which looked quite nice. Also one gets to see where the Kings got on their boats. Also, at the water's edge there is a tiny beach area. There was some construction in the area which is a great sign. When we were in Athens a couple of years ago, the streets were in poor condition and much needed to be improved. It was much nicer to see that Lisbon is trying to keep up with repairs."
