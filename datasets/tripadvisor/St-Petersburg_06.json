            "review": "Opulent and ornate. Bath Block is also known as the Peterhof State Museum Preserve. It consists of the Grand Palace, the lower garden, the fountains, and beautiful gardens. You will be amazed by this place. Everything about it speaks volumes about the way the Tsars lived. It has to be seen to be believed - truly regal and magnificent. The opulence will leave you wondering whether you were in a dream. The gardens are very well maintained and very beautiful. The fountains are something else. The Grand Cascade and the Samson fountain are the main fountains. They look grandiose, and are beautifully decorated. The fountains are switched on in the morning \u2013 and you will love the spectacular show. The fountains work without the use of pumps using instead the pressure caused by the height. A beautiful canal connects the palace to the sea. The Tsar\u2019s visitors would then come up to the palace via this canal. Whichever way you look \u2013 it is simply stunning. The gardens resemble the French style. The beautiful flowers create a wonderful mosaic of colour.This is a must see attraction \u2013 and I thoroughly recommend it. "

When you get there you have to buy a ticket to enter the Bath Block and a separate ticket to get into the palace. The interior of the palace is beautiful, but I personally think the gardens are more impressive. Nevertheless, if you are there, don't miss the opportunity to visit inside and have your own opinion."

We had very good weather with a lot if sun when arriving in Oeterhof, which makes the place even more shiny. There are so many fountains to discover so stroll and enjoy. We decide not to visit the Palace itself but took the little train to go to Alexandria Park. We liked it because Peterhof involves a lot of walking so sitting and enjoying the landscape was nice. Comments only in Russian but with a good guide book you can figure out what it's all about. The excursion costs 300 RUB less than 5\u20ac. Each time you want to enter a pavilion you need to pay. So choose what you exactly want to visit. Personally I found the gardens so enjoyable. There's a kind of seashore. Ah and if possible be there for the start of the fountains. This happens at 11 am. It's crowded so be there early."

The smaller, more intimate spaces used for spa treatments, baths and showers were elegant and oppulent in their own way but much more human and approachable. It is easy to understand why Peter the Great preferred this part of the Peterhof to the grand palace itself."

Boatride was ok, nothing too special. We were told that this would be the most picturesque way to travel to Peterhof but you basicly see mostly sea and some shipyards. You arrive straight to the lower garden (we didnt know that before hand) so you have to buy a ticket straight away to get off the dock. There are no info in English and the staff also communicate mainly in Russian so if you dont speak and/or read Russian you will probably regret that you didnt get your own guide at this point. We bought a ticket not knowing what it would include. We rushed to the castle and saw the massive lines. Line to the ticket office (yes you need a separate ticket to get inside) and line to the castle. They have different opening hours for individual turists (one at 12-14 and other after 17 something) and those who belong to a group. We decided to skip the castle in the end due price, lines and time issues. After that we realized that because we arrived with a boat straight to lower garden, we couldn't visit the other side of the castle at all! If you leave the gates you cannot return without buying a ticket back to lower garden. Confusing and annoying. We ended up going around The Bath Block and enjoying the beautiful fountains with golden statues. The place is lovely and garden is really worth seeing. And the place is huge so even without visiting the castle we spended quite a lot of time wondering around.Wear good shoes, take the whole day and have a guide or go with a guided group. Tours might feel expensive but this is not a cheap destination even if you go by yourself and its not turist friendly for foreigners. Or learn Russian, prepare yourself with rubles and be on time for the lines."

There are plenty of places to have some fun with kids, but also to enjoy the beauty of sculptures. I have not noticed any proper place to eat inside of the park, but very close to it, in the city, you will find something. If you are looking for a cheaper way to get back to Petersburg, try a bus, it will be like 6-7 times cheaper than a boat, but much longer."

The tour of the palace was basically a moving line and there was no time to really take in the rooms. If you went through the rooms at the Hermitage, I would recommend not going through the Palace at Peterhof if the lines are long. Also all he sights are priced \"a la carte\" So you can save some money if you don't go through the palace. The grounds are amazing enough!"

However the throng of people waiting to go through made it nearly impossible to enjoy what we were seeing because we had to keep walking, walking, walking- never lingering over anything, thus in reflection very little is clear. The gardens were spacious and the fountains spectacular. They were all gravity fed and worth a look."

Our knowledgeable guide filled us in on the interesting and chequered history of the palace and its fabulous gardens. The fountains were truly splendid - and we were fortunate enough to visit on a perfect August day so I am sure we experienced Peterhof at its very best.Inside the palace was interesting the rooms opulent and baroque with fantastic views over the gardens and fountains. Everywhere was very crowded which was something we came to accept during our two day tours of the key St Petersburg's attractions.Crowded or not the visit was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed it."

I have been to the Peterhof a long time ago, but this time we appeared to go round a different part. Parts are closed for refurbishment. During the war the Germans more or less destroyed all the precious internal decorations, and I suppose refurbishment is a never ending process. However the lovely walk around the gardens was a new experience with lots of flowers, 150 fountains and 4 cascades, running down to the Gulf of Finland with superb views"

Unfortunately, we didn't get an early enough boat (and we waited about 20 minutes for the boat to leave.) As a result, we arrived in time to catch the end of the music, but not in time to watch the fountains starting up. If you want to see the start-up of the fountains I suggest you ask specifically about the arrival times.The fountains are spectacular, and walking along the paths to discover them is restorative. I'm sure others will write great descriptions.I want to mention one peculiarity of the items that require entry tickets. I was particularly interested in the construction and operation of the fountains and there is a \"Fontanes\" area that is supposed to provide explanation. Unfortunately, everything in this building (next to the church) is in Russian. The women managing this area do not speak English. After paying to enter, we were disappointed. Fortunately, there was a young man visiting from Moscow who explained some of it to us. There also is no place to sit while watching the videos or trying to figure out the schematics. You can have a great day here in the gardens without buying an extra admission. If you are suffering from not having a daily dose of Russian Baroque, go tour the palace. There is enough gold and plaster decoration there to explain the revolution."

As soon as you arrive, the resemblance is striking, but I found Peterhof to be more interesting and accessible. Built originally by Peter the Great (although he didn't often stay here), the gardens are loaded with fountains of all shapes and sizes, and Peter showed his lighter side by putting in many trick fountains to soak and bewilder unsuspecting visitors. I found the cascading checkerboard fountain particularly interesting.The building itself was decimated during the war, but the Russians had the forethought to remove most of the important artifacts in advance of the siege and shipped them to Siberia for safe keeping. Following the war, the building itself and the contents were redone to exact, pre-way specifications. They did an amazing job. Inside and out, this place is awesome.Plan for a long visit, as you'll likely need to take the hydrofoil from St. Petersburg and spend a few hours to just get a small taste of this enormous place. Once you arrive, you won't be anxious to leave. There is no way to see it all quickly, so give yourself the luxury of time."

The main staircase with a waterfall is impressive and there are other interesting points in the park.

If you are visiting, plan a whole morning or afternoon for the visit."

The guided tour of the inside was beautiful, but because we had been to the Catherine Palace in the morning, became a little too repetitive. Any individual room was breath taking, but after 40 such rooms we needed to get our breath back. The grounds, garden and fountains on the other hand were worth a full day. Luckily the sun was shining, which enhanced the spectacular colours of the palace and the grounds. You are obliged to wear shoe covers as you wander around the palace"

It was also my last day with my Travel All Russia group ... talk about saving the best for last!! Seeing Peterhof in the summer means getting to experience the wonderful gardens and fountains... seeing both the outside and inside equally. Being at Peterhof in the summer also means triple the crowds so being with a private guide or a smaller group guide is optimum. The large tour groups with upwards of 20 people started to get a bit too much for me as everyone is trying to position themselves for the perfect camera shot or to see artifacts up close and personal. I recommend allowing double the time and taking the time to work through all the highlights. I am grateful for our wonderful Travel All Russia guide who timed everything perfectly and so we were able to take everything in as much we could. I really loved seeing all the State rooms... especially the Picture Hall and the Divan Room and the alcove with the Empress's bed and sculpture of Catherine II's dog Zemira. I would recommend Peterhof over Catherine's Palace if both can't be done.... less crowded and more to see for sure!!"

You'll want to take the hydrofoil boat ride from St. Petersburg out to Peterhoff. Its only 1/2 hr by boat vs an hours drive and it always adds so much to the experience to take a boat instead of a bus. The place is truly a great monument to Peter the Great who designed Peterhoff's fountains to run automatically and without the use of pumps by using water that is gravity fed from uphill watersources. Just amazing and spectacular. Genius really to know that these fountains have been running without any machines or pumps for hundreds of years, flawlessly. Really, there's too much to describe and so much beauty, you'll just have to go and see it for yourself."

We arrived via the Hydafoil, which certainly is the way to travel. On entering the lower garden and paying ,you come nearly immediatly to a breath taking magnificent fountain - all gilt and classical figures with a staircase of water. Certainly I rate the fountains better than Versaiiles. The whole grounds were impressive. All the museums needed extra money to go into them and had long lines of people waiting. Luckily we found a little museum area where the group was limited to 10 and saw lots of Peter's and wife's personal clothes and possessions. Really it seems needed to do the complex with an English speaking guide. Left the lower garden and went around the Palace to the upper garden - a few nice fountains but the major one all boarded off for repair that might be concluded any time! Had to go through turnstiles again to get back to the lower gardens for the hydrafoil. Here a real rip off forced to pay again to enter to get back to the area we had already paid to visit. If you arrive by hydrafoil forget the top gardens. Tremendous restoration and certainly a must day visit. The food cafe near the hydrafoil station serves nice quick meals."

We arrived in time to see the fountains turned on-- apparently run by Peter's engineering ingenuity, using gravity alone. Not to be missed. Certainly the palace was magnificent. But the gardens and fountains were truly lovely. The trick fountains were whimsical and several of my traveling companions were happy to get soaked. Restorations were still going on--large and small-- as captured by one of the photographs. Very nice bathrooms, too. Also we passed several stands that claimed to grill hamburgers, which made my American mouth water--mundane as that sounds. I kept seeing everything--the magnificence, the opulence-- with an eye towards the extraordinary beauty, and the other eye towards the coming revolution. A poignant juxtaposition. Still, truly remarkable."

Visualizing what it was like years back it must have been an awe inspiring feat and sight to behold.
