The opportunity to wear a samurai armour was also a great idea. Our kids loved it as well. More interactive than expected and despite the slightly dodgy neighbourhood a must for anyone interested in Samurai history and culture. arigato gozaimasu!"

The guided tour was well worth the time to learn more about Jane samurai, and helped put some of the pieces of japanese history and cult ire that we'd picked up along the way. We even learned the difference between a samurai and a ninja!Do it!"

We had some trouble finding it (the map on the website is deceptively simple), and were a bit surprised at the expensive entry fee (\u00a51,800 per person). There aren't many exhibits, but there is a demonstration of how the samurai sword is used in attack and defense. The demonstration is probably the best part of the visit; the exhibits aren't extensive at all, and frankly a bit disappointing. Visit it if you don't mind paying that much to enter, but if you'd rather save the money, I think there are other museums that will be more worthwhile visiting in Tokyo."

It really is a contrast located in the nightlife Host/Hostess bar area, however truly is an amazing place.The entrance fee is 1800 yen which may seem steep. But the staff provide an amazing tour, and during the day they have certain experiences like a swordsmanship display.The museum has a number of original armours on display from the Edo Period. For example Shibata family armour, Oda Nobunaga armour etc. They also have a number of weapons like Musashi Miyamoto's actual sword.The staff are amazingly friendly and very knowledgeable of the exhibits, the tour takes up to an hour but is very informative. They also have a store selling a number of different items including replica swords and also real sword starting from 3000USDIf you have any interest in Japanese Edo History I highly recommend visiting this museum!"

The collection is quite impressive & well displayed, it's enough to illustrate history of the fighting class, the samurai spirit. Go early when it's less busy, & you'll get better attention with the guide, museum opens at 10:30am."

I did not expect much but was really fascinated and impressed from the first moment I entered: the team of the museum really tries to welcome everyone personally and invited anyone to join one of the guided tours, all in English. Small groups are guided to each display section where guides explain the use and the history of the different items, mostly samurai armour and weapons of the different time periods. They even allow guests to try replicas helmets and face masks and invite them to take photos. Amazing !Don't miss the live action martial arts show when a master swordsman and actor shows off his skill with a real Samurai sword."

Tucked in a little street is a small museum that tourists could take a break from all the hustle and bustle, and spend a couple of hours learning a bit of Samurai history. The place is not huge, but there are Samurai armours and weapons. The ticket price includes a guided tour and demonstration. There's also a chance for the visitor to try on a headless and take pictures with it. My daughter did just that and she said the headress was very heavy. It was an enjoyable learning experience."

The multilingual staff were delightful and provided our group of four with an educational tour. The armor are well curated and all displays beautifully lit. We were given the opportunity to dress up in traditional costumes - which provided us with great photo opportunities!!!We joined a larger group for a demonstration of samurai techniques by an experienced samurai actor - his serious demeanor quietened the crowd and we were all transported by his skillful performance. Small gift shop. Would not hesitate to recommend."

Highly recommend doing the guided tour. The cost is already included in the entry ticket. Our guided tour group was too big to start with, but the staff quickly separated us into two groups which was fantastic. Our guide was very knowledgable in the Samurai history and able to explain the history in plain and fun way. It was a very enjoyable experience and also got to wear traditional Japanese and Samurai costumes at the end of the tour. There are also Samurai performances in the afternoon which are definitely worth watching. Again, the cost is already included in the entry ticket. Suggest you go in the afternoon if possible to fit both in at the same time."

We liked how well kept are the armor pieces and the kids loved the opportunity to wear samurai customs and take pictures with the swards at the end of the visit.The visit includes a tour guide which is a big plus. Our guide was very helpful in explaining the complex history of the samurai and was able to easily answer all of our questions and colours to the visit.Did you know that the inspiration for the Darth Vader costume came from one of the samurai leaders? Check it out when you go to the museum...it was impressive to see the original character.It was great, and my only criticism is that the place is small. With hundreds of years of samurai domination I wish they had a larger museum that celebrates their history."

The show was amazing and lasted about 10 minutes. Afterwards, the Samurai (portrayed by an actor) posed for pictures and answered questions from the audience, that was about 15 people. Make sure to check the show times before you show up if that is something that interests you, as they only run at certain times. The tour guides spoke english quite well and were very knowledgeable about the history of the samurai. The tour consists of viewing artifacts (swords, weapons, helmets and samurai armor) and discussion over their use and the historical relevance of the samurai during that period. We spent about 1.5 hours at the venue, including 15 min at the gift shop. The place was very clean, well maintained and nicely appointed. I definitely recommend this and will go again next time I am in Tokyo."

You even get to dress up - totally cool!!"

The museum wasn't busy and we waited just a few minutes for one of the English speaking guides. Our guide was not only knowledgeable regarding the costumes on display and their history, but he was also fun. We all enjoyed our tour and returned for the Samurai Sword presentation later in the afternoon."

As with many people who visit Japan, I've enjoyed films, anime and games based around samurais so I was keen to visit this museum.Not only was it a chance to see some beautiful armour (the craft is incredible) but it was very educational. Due to the Samurai's influence and important in Japanese history you will learn about the history of Japan without being overwhelmed with information. What I really liked is that rather than focusing on what popular culture thinks of, samurai yielding katanas, the museum guide talked about the use of bows and guns.There was a demonstration of swordsmanship that was very well done plus there's a few opportunities to get involved. I tried on a replica helmet (still a handmade outfit) and got my photo which was fun!It is only a short visit, maybe an hour or so, which means that if you're in the area it is definitely worth fitting in. The shop was decent too."

The samurai museum was totally worth seeing. Good English speaking guides were available immediately and took us through the two level exhibition. The information given was interesting as was some of the history. Previous Japanese history is not required, however, on reflection, I wish I knew something before going. I think I would have gotten more from the museum. There was a live demonstration as well as an multiple photo opportunities. The samurai armour sets are amazing to see. Lots of variety and colour. They are in extremely good condition. We were probably there for 60-70 minutes. 50-60 mins is probably the right kind of duration for most people I suspect. Worth seeing"

The highlight for me was being able to see the original Katana belonging to the Great Miyamoto Musashi. After the guided tour we got a watch a 10/15 min performance with an actor using a Katana along with a Q&A session and to top it off, you can take pictures whilst wearing Samurai armour.

Other items were just replicas, eg. some of the swords and armors. It was also fully allowed to take photos.Also the guide will take some photos of you after you have dressed like samurai. They have many costumes there to borrow. Nice feature to make otherwise hard topic much funnier.There was nice little souvenir shop where you could have get a real japanese sword as well. Don't know what they ment with it. At the shop they seemed to have only cheap replicas. Good addition was that you could send for eg. sword to home by mail from the shop and the staff will aid you thru it.I would have been more than satisfied to the standard tour. Anyway there was additional show part. I call it Hollywood part. There were some actor who showed some samurai postures and techniques. Not sure how real or where hes learned them, and honestly it felt little bit like made for dumb tourists. Anyway it was amusing."

You can walk around on your own or with one of the free casual info tours. The owner was on site giving one of the tours as well as a hand-full of english speaking guides. There was also a great Samurai demonstration with Q&A at the end."

He spoke good English and explained the history of samurais with a great knowledge and a nice sense of humor. When I and the rest asked some specific questions he gave the answer immediatelly and just like that.They also had a presentation of using the samurai sword. It was given by a man who seem to been a tv- and movie actor. This guy knew how to use the sword. The presentations were at leat at 2pm, 3pm and 4pm (maybe later as well) but if you go there earlier like we did, you can come back for the presentation. There is a nice sushi place about 100-150 meters from the museum (can't remember its name) so we grabbed a bite and went back.If you have even the slightest interest in Japan history, you need to take a visit.+ you can test to wear those samurai armors yourself."

The place was very disorganised: we were taken to a show on the second floor in a rush, then left on our own in the middle of a room. Once we had a guide, he did not seem to know much about samurais and appeared in a hurry. His only objective was to have us taking pictures and share them on Instagram. There was no general introduction and historical descriptions whatsoever. The show only lasted 5 minutes, then the \"samurai\" took two tourists in the room to teach them some sword tricks while the others had to watch and do nothing: this was extremely boring. Plus it is the most expensive museum we visited in Tokyo.... It is not worth it..."

The children really enjoyed seeing the amour and had even more fun playing with the free swords the gift shop provided. In hindsight, I wish they'd gifted the swords after the tour but I can't really complain about free stuff. Towards the end of the tour we were allowed to try on helmets and various other robes as well as take photos- at no additional charge, which was cool. Overall, I found it to be fun and educational."

Then they invited everyone to try some basic moved and to have their own pictures.- cool shop for souvenirs (some could be delivered at least to your hotel, if not also home abroad).I would recommend only some guidance signs on the nearby streets, as Google maps may not give the most accurate results and you may miss the location (quite a funky neighborhood)."

It's right at the Kabukicho district along one of the smaller roads towards the back. The exterior looked really promising and I couldn't wait to get inside.When I entered, I was politely greeted by a few staff who showed me where to buy the ticket. Right after purchasing the ticket (Now 1,800yen), I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I have been provided a guided tour. Since I was the alone and noone else had arrived at the same time, my guided tour was one-on-one! My friendly guide was a young man, very energetic and enthusiastic (too bad I forgot his name!). We started out on the ground floor where there were real authentic Samurai warrior armour on display. He helpfully explained all the details which I never would have known if I had been on my own. Then we went upstairs - here there were a number of small rooms displaying various Samurai periphenalia. Everything was really interesting and my guide was very engaging, asking me lots of questions to test my knowledge and so that I can relate to the things he was explaining. In one of the rooms, the guide let me put on the face and headgear of a replica samurai armour. At the end, guests can put on kimonos and pose for photos for free. One of the highlights of my Japan trip! The gift shop didn't have much things that interested me but you can buy swords to be shipped home. They even provide a list of countries which do not allow swords to be shipped in, so you know. All in all, I had a great time here. I would have loved it to be a bit bigger with more exhibits!"

It looked so small from outside and when we entered it seemed like hardly anyone was there, then all of sudden all the workers showed up. Entrance fee was quite bit more than I thought it would be, and I was hesitant, but decided since we were there, we will go ahead and go. One of the guys attached himself as our guide and took us through the museum explaining all the history and everything behind items. It was really great! It is much bigger than what you think from outside and items are interesting and narrative from the guide makes it so much better. Exhibition was great and we could try on some of the costume and helmet. It was really wonderful experience and worth the money (I don't remember how much it was, maybe around $15?) I highly recommend it."

I really enjoyed this visit - museum is small and there aren't that many exhibits, but I frankly thought it was sufficient - after the 7th Samurai suit, do you really need to see any more? The guide was very helpful and tried to explain as much as he could. I love the old Japanese things and am fascinated by the Samurai culture, so seeing the suits, swords and hearing/reading some of the stories was really enjoyable. The gift shop has some interesting displays of swords (replicas), but if you are lucky they sometimes have real swords (300 years old!) for sale,and you can get to handle them with care."

The staff is really good, you can tell they love their job, they help you to take pictures and they even let you wear real Samurai helmets...Price, in my opinion is far too high 1800 JPY per person, just as reference national museum is 620 JPY, Golden pagoda in Kyoto 400 JPY, Kyozumidera in Tokyo 600 JPY."

You could see all the original samurai complete outfits and a personal guide explained all the exhibits to you in English! There were even small rooms of the actual swords they used and pistols/guns! They had a place where you could try on the head gear and take pictures with your own camera, or if you have extra time, you can dress up in complete samurai outfits and kimonos and they will take your picture, for a fee (like the old west pictures that are taken in the US.)

Tetsuro-san started the museum in 2015, to share his personal collection of ornate samurai artifacts and his extensive knowledge with the public. He's a very thoughtful and down to earth person, and gave me and a friend from Taiwan an amazing tour through his museum - allowing us to feel and try on many of the pieces. It was really fun and at the end of the tour I was so immersed that I had to rub my eyes to remember that it is the year 2016. I was already having a great time, but it became one of my best memories of the trip when Tetsuro-san took me and my Taiwanese friend to a small Izakaya for drinks after the tour, and I was in great company. I guess he couldn't do that for every visitor, but it just shows what a truly lovely person he is. The samurai museum is a lot of fun and the host is a one of a kind."

I also had the opportunity to learn basic Samurai skills by a man trained in the ways of the Samurai.

You wont come across any other samurai artifacts or history while your in tokyo. Where else you going to hold a samurai sword?"

One of the pricer museums around (\u00a51800), its staff tries very hard to explain the pieces on display. We were followed by a nice guide who knew enough English to help us understand the armor, the weapons, and some of the people that used them in Japanese history. There are some authentic pieces, and a few reproductions. A nice addition was an actor who demonstrated a few moves with a katana sword. All in all, a nice break (with good air conditioning!) from the pressing masses outside. Nothing extravagant or jaw dropping...but worth your time."

It takes about an hour, and you can put on a replica samurai helmet and see a demo of the sword handling. Each group was walked through individually and then guided to the demo.

Once there we were fortunate enough to see a live show. An actor displayed some of the stances and fighting techniques of the samurai. We were then able to look closely at the amour and swords in the various rooms. The attendants were on hand to answer questions and allowed us to try on the helmets and amour. They added a more personal touch. My 2 kids who weren't really into samurai seemed to also enjoy this experience. One disappointment though was the gift shop. Unless you were going to purchase a replica sword there wasn't much on offer. I would have thought an English book on swords or some sword key rings would have been good to have. Overall I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who is interested in samurai."

Between the samurai show, seeing old equipment and dressing up with replicas, this place certainly packs a punch despite its somewhat small size. The dim lighting can make it difficult to take pictures, but fortunately some areas are specifically created for taking pictures when you try things on.Additionally, our tour guide was very enthusiastic and friendly. Once we completed the museum we spoke with the owner for close to an hour.

The Japanese are known to be hospitable and helpful, but this place goes over and above the norm. Staff will eagerly give you a guided tour of the place, explaining what each piece is and whose armor is on display, will give brief histories of battles painted on the walls and even how famous the generals. If you already know the names: Nobunaga Oda, Ieyasu Tokugawa, Yukimura Sanada, Shingen Takeda, Kenshin Uesugi, Kanetsugu Naoe, Masamune Date and Hideyoshi Toyotomi, then you're in for a treat, you can find amazing replicas of their armors here. The guides also do their best in explaining everything in English, to the best of their ability of course, and they're pretty good English speakers compared to a lot of locals. The ticket is even good for a return visit so you can watch their live Samurai show and ask questions! I personally came back to the museum myself, and it is totally worth the walk. If you can speak Japanese like myself, then you're in for a treat because then you'll find out really how well the staff members know their stuff. They know more about the history than those of the samurai on display, and you can even trade stories about your favorite samurai and theirs. They also know a lot about the history of the warring states period such as Oichi being the most beautiful in the land, and contrary to some media, that she didn't actually fight in any battles with a toy or battle hoops. I closing, I would say definitely check this place out because of how well the museum treats it's guests, how knowledgeable the staff are, and how beautiful the things on display are. You can even touch some of them!"

It has only been open 6 months but already seems to display a large range of attractions for a small private museum. Suits a range of ages, from kids to adults.They have a great private tour guide who is very informative about all the exhibits. Many of the second floor exhibits (such as helmets and face masks) you can try on and take photos. The highlight was the real samurai sword technique demonstration."

There were posters with half naked people and signs with things like Love Room or massage posters of women in thongs. I couldn't explain to my daughter why 6 or so men were on a board naked with there private parts covers. So awkward. Anyway, the museum is quite small but my husband loved looking at all the different armor and swords and guns. We were on a tight time schedule but stayed for the samurai show. I expected more. I didn't expect to be in a room that was so quiet you could literally hear a pin drop. The show was basically a samurai doing different poses with a sword. Slow movements and maybe only two words which were \"hai\" screamed loudly. It was neat to see but way to long for it being that slow."

That might be due in part to my passion for all things samurai-related. If this is not something which interests you, but still want to look at some armours and weapons, I still recommend going, but I advise keeping your expectations low. There are regular demonstrations by an actor / katana master which are short and sweet."

I had mixed feelings about it -- I am naturally skeptical of everything and the number of things that seemed like replicas, particularly the canvases and artwork, felt a bit off. We had a young lady give us a guided tour, but she seemed to only be able to stick to her script and wasn't really able to field most of the questions we had. Maybe it was a language thing, but I'm not so sure. The whole thing felt a bit amateur, so Samurai Museum is probably a generous term. Even so, we got to try on some \"authentic\" -- dubious, but whatever -- samurai gear, hold a katana, and watch a short demonstration by a modern samurai of the different stances. Worth the price of the cheap admission."

On the second floor, you get to see more armor, helmets, and swords. Side note: you have to take off your shoes on second floor, so wear some comfortable socks. I enjoyed having a guide tell us about the history behind certain pieces. Also make sure to stay for the samurai sword shows. You can take pictures of the guy as he poses with samurai sword before doing a little show, roughly 15 minutes. I also got a mini samurai to take home from the gift shop. Overall an experience you don't want to miss."

My partner loves Samurai history, so after a long search for this museum as its not easy to find, we expected more historical and advanced insight to the samurai. Although it was small and had serval intimate rooms to view up close the original tools, swords and armour: the guide lacked knowledge beyond average so was unable to answer any of my partners questions. The show seemed like a good idea and was what sold the ticket to the museum to us as its quiet expensive. The man who performed didn't mention any history, or explain his motions. He just performed slow movements like fighting stances for almost an hour which got a little tiring if I'm honest. We were expecting friendly sparing between two samurai fighters in armour or something more informative. Although we were pleased we had at least found it after our search and did enjoy seeing the display, not recommended unless you have knowledgeable interest into the samurai and money to burn."

After paying to go inside we were joined by a guide who took us around the museum and explained all of the items to us. I didn't expect this and it was free of charge which I thought was great and the guide was very informative. In the gift shop you can but a Samurai sword and have it shipped back home - I did this and it arrived a few weeks after me. Its a great souvenir and you can track the delivery online. Please be aware that shipping will cost just under what the sword did and when it gets to customs (UK) you will pay \u00a330 to have it released due to taxes.Overall this museum is well worth a visit and great value."

The guided tour is great and is a good way to ensure that people know what the several artefacts are about. The samurai display show at 2, 3 and 4pm are worth seeing so I recommend that you plan to visit around these times. You will only need 30 mins for the guided tour part and then around 15 mins for the show. The entrance price may appear to be on the high side but remember that you are supporting the display of the owner's private collection and not some big business. Worth the visit if you are interested in Samurai and some history of Japan."

The staff were friendly and accommodating; they did their best to explain exhibits in English although the information they provided was limited. On the 2nd floor, you are even allowed to touch and put on some of the exhibits to take pictures with. There's also a little photo corner where you can dress up as well. However, their collection is rather small and the information on the plaques regarding each exhibit was not very informative. Unless you already have a general knowledge of the Sengoku period, you wouldn't actually understand much. The 2nd floor has a small section for the Bakumatsu but again, there was not much information that explained who Sakamoto Ryoma is and what he did, or much on the Shinsengumi. It would not take long to go through this museum but overall still worth a visit."

We found it we only a few other visitors, and were fortunate to have an extremely knowledgeable guide who explained so much history to us. His stories actually provided context to some of the other tourist attractions we visited around Tokyo (e.g. Meiji Shrine in Harajuku). We also had some much fun dressing in the traditional costumes! Our guide took our photo for us, and he did a great job. Many other reviews say it doesn't take that long to go around, but if you have the right guide and patience to read all the displays, then it takes about an hour to see everything. I definitely recommend you visit this museum!"

Numerous displays of Samurai armor, most of it genuine, as well as swords and other components of Samurai culture are also displayed.There are some interesting and different items for sale in the small gift shop as well as authentic antique swords for sale (you do have to ask about them).Anyone even remotely interested in Japanese history and culture should make this new museum a must!"

His English was sufficient and he was nice young lad, but I didn't get a lot of overview of the Samurai culture and history. I am history buff though, so my standards probably are very high in that regard.Did not get to see a sword show on a Sunday night. Perhaps it would be good to post a comprehensive list of the included items at the ticket.If you are in the area and your budget isn't tight, you can't to wrong. If you love samurai culture and want to see some items up close it is also a good spot. Otherwise there is Samurai items in the Tokyo museum, that probably will be enough for you. For me it was OK but overpriced. I'd rather have comprehensive placards and a lower price than a personal tour.The Samurai swords in the shop looked pretty cool though and they ship them now."

Our courteous tour guide allowed us to browse the exhibits at our leisure and introduced each display only when he noticed we were ready for the next one. The exhibits were all well laid out with a room holding a handful of artifacts with descriptions. Some were lacking in more detailed information and that's when our guide graciously provided some background. The displays themselves were of very high quality and definitely gave you a sense of the power, fear and respect each of the wearers'/wielders' garnered. One of the highlights is definitely being given the opportunity to wear a genuine general's helmet, faceplate and a sword. It really gave you a sense of the weight of it and how strong they would have to be to wear the entire ensemble. The sword demonstration held multiple times a day was also very entertaining and luckily if you happen to just miss one you can come back and see the next as long as you present your ticket. The small gift shop had some replica swords (which I admittedly was tempted by) for what seemed like a reasonable \u00a56000-7000. Make sure you take into consideration the shipping and customs fees which a sign indicates the staff will help you sort out. I highly recommend this museum if you have an even passing interest in samurai history (and cool armour and weapons)."

We were guided by an english speaking man whi did his best to explain the history and the meaning of all those swords and armours. The real samurai show was amazing. He did kinda \"samurai kata\" and we could ask questions and take pictures. Even getting dressed as an samurai was free of charge. Mr. Tetsuro-san who is the owner is the kindest person and showed us very good service. This place feels relaxing and intimate. A must visit when you are in Tokyo."

The staff there are very friendly and they do have differing levels of English. It is quite a small museum, which require you to take off your shoes in the second section, but it's well worth seeing all the different armours and how the clothing developed and hair style developed through the years. We tried to take our time to see all the different things, but we were probably out the museum within 45mins. I'm sure some people did it less than 10. Mainly because it's not that big and there could perhaps be more information of some of the samurais. However unlike may other places in Japan, you can try on the Samurai clothing, kimonos along with any props for free. The staff were also very willing to take photos of us,If you have some spare time and are in the area, I do recommend visiting."

The museum is situated in the Golden Gai, very easy to miss but not difficult to find if you have GPS (don't even need data, your phone should still update location without data). We were one of the first people to enter the museum that day and were lucky enough to score ourselves a guided tour with Gin. He was very friendly and explained the history behind each exhibit. We had many questions and he was able to answer almost all of them! We would have missed a lot of things without a guided tour so very glad they offered this service, without request or at an extra fee!There are a few exhibits that you are allowed to touch and some pieces that you are allowed to try on, which was awesome! We were allowed to dress up in some traditional robes without the 500 yen fee as the museum was very quiet and not many other guests were there. There was also a live show which we were too early for, but as long as you keep your admission ticket, you can return later in the day to watch it.A great place to learn a bit about Japan history, very lovely experience to cap off our trip. We even met the owner when we were browsing the souvenir store. My fiance bought a replica katana and the owner told us the history of the samurai that held the sword. I would definitely recommend a visit to this museum if you're interested in Japanese history!!"

We went there based on the the tripadvisor reviews we read before and it was definitely worthwhile to go.It is a small museum in the entertainment area of Shinjuku area. Just to walk around the area of the museum is already worth the trip!The museum itself is small and spread via two floors. You will need about 30 minutes to one hour to get through it. A personal guide will follow you around. I think they do this also for security reasons. The guide we had did not had much of a clue, but a guide from another group we saw seemed pretty knowledgeable. A lot of the displays are reproductions and only a few are real! However it is still worthwhile to look at everything as also the reproductions are very beautiful and nicely made.I would also not really call it a museum, but more a private samurai entertainment museum. This is because of the limited actual original objects on display. The way the guide goes around and interacts with you. The shows they do and the fact that you can try on some masks to take pictures and the professional photo studio area with different costumes and backdrops and the big shop at the end.Nevertheless a nice little fun place to visit especially, if you are in that area of Tokyo anyway."

It\u2019s rather small and would have been a much nicer experience if there was a proper guide. Before I paid for my ticket I asked the young lady at the ticket booth if they had an \u201caudio guide\u201d \u2013 by which I meant a pre-recorded narrative of the museum on headphones. I like this system because they are usually very well made, the content is legitimate, recorded in proper English and you can pace it at your own rhythm. The audio guides at the Edo Museum are very well made. The girl confirmed that they had audio guides so I paid for my ticket. There was no \u201caudio guide\u201d \u2026 she was my \u201caudio guide\u201d and began to escort me around the museum. I immediately realised that she was not well informed. I asked her about the katana sword because I had seen a documentary and I knew that the katanas are traditionally made from a specialised Japanese. I could not remember the name of the steel \u2026 but she had no clue. Later I looked it up; it\u2019s tamahagane steel. On the second floor I noticed that there were several references to The Siege of Osaka so I was curious and asked her what it was. She didn\u2019t know!! So my recommendation for visitors is that you read about the Samurai before you to the museum so that you can appreciate the experience. My recommendation to the museum: invest in an \u201caudio guide\u201d system with a professional commentary. Alternatively \u2013 get qualified guides."

The neighborhood of kabuki-cho is fairly touristy and red light, but this is a high quality legitimate museum. It is not gimmicky at all. The collection is small and consists of samurai armor, weapons, and a few murals. Some of the items are authentic historical pieces ranging from 250-800 years old, and some of the items are reproductions or modern restorations. However, these are not low quality reproductions, they are artisan crafted and very well done. I actually enjoyed the reproductions greatly because you can touch, hold, and in some cases even wear the armor. It was a very immersive experience to feel the heft of several of the iron helmets. Our tour guide was the owner of the museum, and he gave a superb tour. He was knowledgeable and interesting, and his English was pretty good. Because we were interested, he got into a lot of the details of the methods of construction and the different styles and types of weapons and armor. Highly recommended."

The museum was not large but has some really nice period and replica armour on display, along with period firearms and weapons. The owner and staff are what made it extra special though. I was guided through all the displays in person in english, and Provided with a knowledgeable and informative history lesson. There was a sword master demonstration while i was there which you were invited to participate in and you could try on some armour and garb. They also have replica katanas for sale in the gift shop if your country of origin will let you bring it home. All in all a great place to go. Picture taking of the displays is allowed"

Stays open late and the staff are outstanding-when we asked for a dinner recommendation, our guide insisted on showing us to a nearby place and sure enough, there was a line of locals waiting to eat tasty udon noodles.

It ended up being one of our favorite experiences during our trip!We walked in, and we were greeted by a tour-guide, who to our surprise guided us through the entire museum in English! This was amazing, since my Japanese is very basic, and my friend speaks no Japanese at all, so we were both able to fully enjoy the exhibits and learn all the history behind each one. We spoke with two tour guides (I unfortunately did not get their name, \u3054\u3081\u3093\u306a\u3055\u3044\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01), and they were extremely friendly and outgoing, and readily spoke to me in both English and Japanese (despite how bad it was)! We also stayed for the short Iaid\u014d performance, which was very cool and worth the watch! Afterwards the martial artist took questions, and was also very energetic and friendly!Overall, this was one of the best experiences of our trip! If you're someone like me who has a passion for Japanese (especially samurai) history, if you enjoy certain pop culture media that references people like Tokugawa Ieyasu (Sengoku Basara, Basilisk) or the Shinsengumi (Gintama, Hakuouki, Peacemaker Kurogane), or if you're like my friend who is just being dragged along, you're sure to have fun!\u30db\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01\u697d\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\uff01- Olivia (Massachusetts)"

Went with 8 friends so a very large group to cater for in most of these places in Tokyo (most of the buildings being small) First thing was that it was kind of difficult to find, it's in the middle of an alleyway off the Main Street 3 or 4 blocks away from the closet train centre BUT! It would have been easier to find if we had thought to write down directions before we left as we haven't bought any SIM cards. The price was \u00a51500 which I consider very well priced for the service provided. The first 30 or so minutes was spent walking around the rooms of the two story museum with a guide (all of the staff members spoke very very good English!) telling us seriously fascinating information about Japanese history and culture. During the guided tour, one person from our group was able to put on a helmet and mask and take photos (seriously amazing experience) Then we were able to watch a lovely demonstration of a samurai who had been training for 10 years, model a fight with a sword. After the display (about 5 minutes) he invited people from the crowd (which was only our group of 9 and one other couple) up to go through the movements with him. Very funny and entertaining. There was then a questions section where we would ask questions then they would ask us questions about the differences in our culture ect (very engaging and fun!) Then the souvenir shop where the prices were great! Full replica samurai swords from \u00a57000-19000 and detailed models for about \u00a52500.All in all a great experience for traditional Japanese culture, very interesting and enjoyable and most importantly affordable!!"

There was a free show involving a gentlemen pretending to be a samurai and answering questions. There was a chance to hold a sword and try on armour for an additional \u00a5500. However it was a fair bit smaller than expected and wouldn't take more that about 45 minutes to see everything."

After a few others arrived, he offered to let us see a show even though one was not scheduled for this time. The show itself was short, and although not exhilarating by any means, it was interesting. There are a few interesting things to look at as well, and you are encouraged to touch the samurai armour and take photos. We spent maybe an hour here total and this was definitely enough to take in all the museum had to offer."

He spoke good English and generously took the time to answer my questions and explain the items, their history and significance to me as we moved through the exhibits. Unlike the city museums, you have plenty of time and space to examine this amazing Samurai exhibit and take photos in a nice, quiet setting which I really appreciated. On the way out, the small gift shop also has some nice items to pick up as souvenirs and help further support the museum. I really enjoyed my visit to the Samurai Museum and would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in Samurai-era artifacts, especially if you would enjoy seeing these items in a peaceful setting without being rushed through by crowds like at the noisy big museums.

In fact we walked past it twice before we realised it was what we were looking for.Not huge but very well done with good explanations of each exhibit. This place is great for a little cultural history, and the owners are more than pleased to walk with you and explain if you have questions. They are clearly very proud of their museum and with good reason, it's small but informative, and you'll even get the chance to play dress up and have your pic taken if you're of a mind to do so. It doesn't seem to get very busy - we were the only visitors at the time but I preferred the lack of crowds if I'm honest.Entry fee wasn't expensive, and there's a little gift area at the end.

This small museum has been opened just a few weeks ago, and serves as a wonderful cultural contrast to lively Shinjuku area. It displays several very well-preserved samurai armor suits, as well as weapons and swords, and provides a bit of background on the history of japanese Samurai. It covers two floors of a historical building in Shinjuku, and is perfect, if you would like to spend about an hour with a cultural heritage of Japan. In case, you are interested in more background information, the owner and the staff would be glad to provide it, even if the communication is sometimes a bit difficult, but you can always feel the dedication of the owner and staff to provide a wonderful experience to their guests. You can also make pictures of your own, dressed in a historic samurai armor including helmet and sword, which is a fun experience. We can highly recommend this small hidden gem, and hope, that many travellers would visit it, when they are in Shinjuku. It is only 2 blocks north from the Robot Restaurant, or 2 blocks north-east from the hotel complex \"Gracery Shinjuku\" (with the Godzilla on its roof)."

As I went early, I was alone in the museum and got the fantastic owner as a personal guide. You can tell he's very proud of the museum and it's artifacts, he even took out a few for me to hold. The museums interior is very traditional and old fashioned, with a light touch of incense (that you can buy in the shop) and relaxing music. I felt very centered, happy and calm after leaving the museum, it was a well needed pause from the otherwise high pace of Tokyo. Fun parts was the masks, outfits and swords you can try on and get photographed with, probably the coolest selfie you'll get in Tokyo. And of course - you'll even learn a bit of Japanese history!"

Friendly staff telling about the samurai eras and how to wear the helmets and armour - and we were even allowed to hold weapons and try on the clothing. Very interesting place. Highly recommended. Small place with lots of atmosphere! Thank you!"

            "review": "Authentic and Interesting Change of pace. Spread over 2 floors with lots of interesting artefacts the museum is a good break from the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku. Not far from the Robot Restaurant, I found this unexpected jewel. My understanding is that this was originally a private collection that has been open to the public. It was interesting to see the changes in armour and the swords over the ages, and the care and presentation is fantastic. They were offering free photos of you dressed up with some samurai outfits/ swords - taken by your friends or their staff would manage your phone/camera - good for Facebook profile pics etc.It was also a good place to buy good reproduction samurai swords (if that is your thing) from fairly cheap (under US$100 to more expensive). I always wanted one as a teenager when i was into karate. They also talk a bit about when samurai moved to using guns and have some original guns on display too (you cannot buy any guns). It is a loss to move from honour and mastery of a sword to shooting people from a distance. I also like samurai movies so i could be biased. You can also buy a small model samurai armour at the museum - which is a great idea for teenage and older gifts especially for boys. In Japan a Japanese Doll or Kimono is a good gift for a woman, and an equivalent but cool gift for a boy would be the small samurai armour (and not as pointy as a sword). If i can get pictures from my phone i will attach.Staff were helpful and enthusiastic about their collection, and I would recommend a visit. Note - you take your shoes off on the second floor - so wear nice socks..."

            "review": "An unexpected. A very enjoyable experience. The photos on the wall outside didn't do the place justice - making it look like a very small in-and-out type place, but it wasn't. It was the perfect size, not too short that you felt it was a waste of money, and not too long that it got boring.The staff were extremely pleasant and fun--one could see they wanted visitors to have the best experience rather than the typical snooty museum. Everything came across as very honest, even the beautiful swords that one could purchase at the end were such good value I had to double check I was converting the currency right."

            "review": "A hidden jewel of a museum in Shinjuku. Looking like lost tourists studying a map on the street, we were approached by a kind gentleman who spoke excellent English.As it happens, Mr. Tetsuro Koyano had just opened the Samurai Museum one week prior & invited us attend his museum as guests. I have long had a great interest in the shogun eras, especially in yabusame, but artifacts from that time in most museums I\u2019ve been to have been sporadic. The Samurai Museum is replete with armory, weaponry, historical information, and the like. The collection is spread over two floors &, while I imagine additional artifacts will be added over time, it has been excellently curated. I cannot stress how fulfilling visiting this museum was for us. We literally spent our last couple of hours of our stay in Japan at the museum, then headed straight to the airport for our return journey."

Cool in the quaint appearance, stunning armor form a line and Once inside, spreads suddenly space, such as time slip. In 2F, and then view it take off your shoes. I feel stylish good offices incorporating casually Japanese lifestyle. You can see the familiar and great swords and helmet. Also the history of Japan through the \"Samurai\" was also able to learn interesting. There was also a space that can photographed wearing armor and helmet."
