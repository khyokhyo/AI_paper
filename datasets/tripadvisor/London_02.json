Puzzles were hard enough to be challenging but not too many hints were needed so there was still a sense of achievement. Even with expectations you will be pleasantly surprised :) Turn up a bit earlier to have a lounge in the very nice waiting area complete with foozeball table and a coffee / hot chocolate machine. We actually stayed there for a half hour after the quest just relaxing and playing the harry potter trival pursuit. All in all a very pleasant experience both before and after. A quick mention and thanks to Shane who was an awesome quest master and host."

I had never done an escape the room before, but this did NOT disappoint! Not as easy as you think, but really fun and the guy running it was really nice ( and did have to help us out a couple of times). Really easy to find, so central.Could not recommend more - we will be back to do the heist one soon!!Thank you very much!"

For starters, the relax, pre-prep area is super cozy and nice. There's free hot drinks and water along with trivia cards, games and fun decoration. The host we had (can't remember her name) was super sweet! We got lockers for our stuff then went into the game. The props are all handmade and the place itself looks fantastic. A lot of work was put into this escape room and you can tell. Our host was super relaxed and answered all of our questions afterwards! We were a group of four with 8 minutes to spare. The level of difficulty was perfect. Not too hard to get to your next step!Lastly, we were the last group of the night as we finished for 1030 and she let us hang out in the prep room until they closed! Super friendly staff, amazing props, fantastic escape experience and free, nice hot drinks. I would totally recommend to anyone! A new bank heist room is opening soon and I definitely plan to go back to see how that one is! 10 out of 10!"

Initially we waited in the games room as we were early where we had fun with table football and various games set out and drinks were available. Our host then explained what we were about to do and that we could ask for a clue to help us at any time. We set to the task enthusiastically. There was a full range of cryptic clues and problem solving involved which required some thought but which were achievable so we were really motivated to go as far as we could in the allotted time. Clues were given along the way to assist us if we were stuck on a particular problem. Overall I think the content of the tasks required was spot on.

Even though 1 of us was not familiar with the Harry Potter series, we were able to successfully complete the adventure. Of the two escape adventures we had done, this was definitely one that required more wits than just relying on logic. The staff gave appropriate hints throughout, which we definitely needed, and the last room revealed was a little creepy (I had to keep reminding myself out loud that it was not real). After we completed the room, the staff had time to do a de-brief with us showing us some things we had missed along the way, which was almost as much fun as the actual run. I look forward to the next adventures they are developing. Great times!!!!"

By the end, the entire family is running around figuring things out.A few of the riddles might be too tough for a kid to reason out on their own, but most can be reasoned through with some parental guidance and help from a mysterious voice in the room. It took us the entire hour to complete the whole thing.(WARNING: There is one puzzle that is really a wild goose chase resulting in a plug for the company's logo. It has nothing to do with the rest of the story. We lost some time figuring it out only to realize it had nothing to do with the rest of the task at hand.

A lot of details and care was put into the design of the rooms, which made it even more engulfing. We had a great time, thank you Enigma team"

The location is perfect and bright yet you feel on edge (I guess because you know you're about to be locked in a room with only your wits and smarts to get you out) I absolutely would try another escape room experience with Enigma Quests. I also loved the fact that you don't have to know every tiny detail of Harry Potter as well you can go in to the game with a bare minimum knowledge and still have oodles of fun. :) P.S. Adding the spells in the magic room that reacts to the wand made my inner potterhead squeal with delight. "

We all loved it and the children are still talking about it now. A really great experience and we were very well looked after at the beginning and the end. I would definitely recommend it and have told all our friends so that they can enjoy it too. It's easy to get to as its right next to Liverpool St Station or Moorgate Tube. There is tea and coffee available when you get there plus lots of games and a table football. It's not scary and I would think children as young as 8 would enjoy it but it is also cleverly set so that a team of adults would also find it taxing if they didn't ask for hints.

My A friends and I secured highly coveted Harry Potter and the Cursed Child tickets and decided to build a trip to London (we're from Los Angeles) around all Harry Potter-related activities. Whilst researching, I stumbled upon Enigma Quests and it was hands down one of the best parts of the trip. Out of our group of 4, 2 of us had prior escape room experience and they both thought this was the best escape one they've ever tried. Granted, our opinion may be slightly biased because of the whole \"magic\" component, but, without spoiling any part of the game, it was a fantastic combination of the logical (puzzles, critical thinking, etc.) and the magical (theme, setting, etc.). The place itself was easy to find--they send you very helpful and accurate directions. Once you make it into the waiting room area (painted a bright yellow, with a coffee station, assorted sweets, and mounds of games, including a Foosball table), they give you a few minutes to settle down. A bathroom key is handed to you and there are lockers for your things. I am hugely embarrassed to say we do not remember the name of our guide---Shane? Scott? SORRY! Under any other circumstances, we would've definitely remembered (as he was rather cute, especially with that British accent), but we were too excited about the game/distracted by said accent and promptly lost our wits. He gave us a quick introduction to the game, offered some general advice, and told us we could ask for help if necessary. You are given an hour to finish the game. The game itself was hugely thrilling. There is plenty for everyone to do--we felt like our group of 4 was totally sufficient--and we were absolutely screaming with laughter and excitement throughout, especially at the end. We were given some helpful but not obvious nudges along the way from our cute guide, who did an extraordinarily good job of knowing just what to tell us over the speaker system, and there was definitely alot of wand waving and shrieks of \"I KNEW I WAS A WIZARD.\" It's a bit spooky and a bit old-timey feeling and a bit everything that any Harry Potter fan could ever want of an escape room.Once you finish the game, hopefully successfully within the hour, your guide comes in to take a \"graduation photo\"--cue draping thyself in wizards robes, grabbing wands, shoving on the sorting hat, and propping round spectacles on your nose. We are smiling so widely in our photo, you would think we'd actually gone to Hogwarts. O for OUTSTANDING!!!"

I was a bit nervours but everything went great.There are all kinds of tasks, most of them are for english speaking adults but some were good for children, too. And they are all perfect for Potter fans!If one wishes for no assistance, one should ask them not to help, I think that a group oh adulst may (may!) complete the quest in time without any help but our goal was just to finnish. They give hints if one wants, so dont be afraid to do this! If You are a Potter fan and a little bit childish in a good way, then You should definetely do this!!!!!!"

I booked the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at Enigma Quests for my girlfriend's birthday after looking around at what escape rooms London had to offer.While the game we played wasn't a traditional escape room, it was one of the best experiences we've ever had, her being a huge Harry Potter fan and me really disliking it, I still loved it here!The room(s) were beautiful decorated and immersive and we were so impressed at the love that has gone into this quest. We were allowed to play as a 2 but were told we would have to book for a group of 3 and they would give us hints if it was too tough. It seemed a little expensive but well worth it after all.We managed to complete all of the tasks in the room with 3 minutes to go and it was exhilarating right until the end. Without giving too much away, there was an excellent variety of challenges, from potion making and solving maths puzzles to riddles and simple searching of the room(s).We had the best time at Enigma Quests and will definitely be back to play their other games, they made my girlfriend's birthday!!Thank you!"

The effort that has gone into making them is staggering, the level of detail outstanding. The game itself is an intermediate standard, not hugely challenging. I went with a group of 4 friends (27-31 years old) and we found it fairly straightforward though we finished with only 5 minutes to spare. I'd imagine a family with kids (10+) would really enjoy this and find it a tough challenge.On the whole I found the game really good fun, though not as tough as other games I've played (such as Cluequest). The spectacular scenery and effort that has gone into making them deserves 5 stars alone."

A truly enchanting hours' spent, this very interesting take on the roomescape formula will knock even hardcore gamers out of their boots. If you're a fan of puzzles and the Harry Potter story, there isn't much to dwell on here. Everything is authentic, from the atmosphere to the decorations. This is your one hour trip to Hogwarts that you musn't miss! Also, the staff was incredibly polite and helpful, and it is instantly noticeable how much effort they are putting into this. The puzzles themselves are innovative and in the vein of Hogwarts, so that's a big plus. If you're a newcomer to games, they will know how to intervene and help you at the right moment, so don't back out of trying because of that.Simply put; magical! Not a recommendation but a must see for everyone!"

The School of Witchcraft and Wizardry theme is perfect for any Harry Potter fans but also for those who appreciate a strong, cohesive theme which is reflected in the set design, magical elements and the type of tasks that you have to solve. It's a refreshing change to have an Escape Room game without a padlock in sight and that you have to ask for help when you're stumped so it doesn't feel like you're helped along unnecessarily and gives you time to think it through. An intermediate level type of Escape room which makes it suitable for a mixed group with children and big kids at heart.A fun filled, brain teasing and magical hour quickly flew by. The sad part is it went by too quickly, we wanted more!Thank you Enigma Quests, we're looking forward to your next Escape Room :)"

Enigma Quests isn\u2019t like any locked room game company I\u2019ve encountered and their School of Witchcraft and Wizardry game isn\u2019t like any I\u2019ve ever played. In fact, they don\u2019t even call it a locked room game. Instead they see it as a quest. A quest to graduate from the school of witchcraft and wizardry.Basically in order to graduate you have to complete a series of puzzles that test their skills in various classes such as potions and ancient runes. As you figure out each of these you are rewarded with a wooden ball to show that you have passed in this subject. We spent the first five minutes in complete awe at our surroundings as the attention to detail in the rooms was beyond anything I have ever seen. A lot of locked room games don\u2019t really have a cohesive theme or story but here the complete opposite is true.What sets Enigma Quests apart from the others that I have taken part it is that it\u2019s impossible to completely fail the game. Even if you only obtain four out of five of the wooden balls you still feel as though you have achieved something and are also given the opportunity to carry on even after the time limit is up so you can experience the game to the full. They also don\u2019t rely on too many padlocks and codes instead using some really remarkable technology to give the illusion of real magic.I\u2019ve done a total of four \u201cescape rooms\u201d now and have made it out of each one successfully. This one was by far the hardest though and we graduated with less than a minute to spare! It was a really intense ending."

Clarke's quote on sufficiently advanced technology being indistinguishable from magic)The quest does not assume any advance knowledge (it is somewhat inspired by a well known book series involving wizardry education, but all elements are unique and original).The staff lady was very professional, positive and after the quest told us about some of the awesome stuff going on behind the scenes .Two couples is the right group size of group to enjoy this escape quest."

Of course, as harry potter fans, we were thrilled about the great details and the chance to finally be wizards and witches ourselves! You have to solve a good variety of riddles and puzzles so everyone really gets the chance to prove their strengths. 2 of us were newbies to escape games and 2 of us have already done another one and it was great fun and we enjoyed our time. (even if this hour was gone so quickly!) Thanks for having us!"

It was really easy to find, very close to both Liverpool Street Station and Moorgate Station. We were warmly welcomed and shown to a fun room with beanbags and table football. There were nice touches like bowls of sweets, games and tea and coffee making facilities. The 'rules' of the game were explained to us and we were the shown to the room. We had such a great time trying to solve all the puzzles and riddles, we needed a few hints but we managed to solve all the challenges and graduate within the hour! All the kids and adults thoroughly enjoyed it and would love to do another one. It wasn't too easy or too hard, a bit challenging but with the odd hint it was really fun to solve all the clues. The set up of the rooms was fantastic, really authentic and very clever how they do things. They took some lovely photos of us afterwards and emailed them to us a couple of days later. We will definitely be back for the new bank robber challenge :-) Thank you for a great birthday celebration."

A couple of us had played an escape game before, but weren't sure what to expect from this, and others were complete beginners.What a fantastic experience it turned out to be! The staff were so friendly and accommodating (big thank you to our host, Nargiza!), and the game itself \u2013 while I won't spoil anything \u2013 was very well-designed. The puzzles are challenging but flow really well once you get into the swing of things, and Harry Potter fans will appreciate all the details, both small and big, that are involved in the design of the rooms, and the puzzles themselves (although there's no prior knowledge of Harry Potter actually required for the puzzles, so it's suitable for your less geeky friends to join in with as well). There's excellent use of physical effects throughout as well, which do a wonderful job of immersing you in the game world.I don't want to say anything else lest I ruin the magic of it all, but if you're a fan of Harry Potter, escape games, or both, definitely give this one a go!As we were in two groups, we were able to play consecutively in the same time slot (the booked time slots are every 2 hours, but the game itself lasts an hour), with each group waiting in the lounge area with complimentary drinks and snacks, and various games and puzzles to play with.Can't wait to come back for future games!"

But never fear, handy hints come through on a microphone if very stuck (which we were!)A lot of effort has gone into making the room look believable and there's secret doors, passages and hidey holes galore.

The various magical happenings that we came across were a fun touch that really helped this feeling of the whole thing being in character.It's certainly not the hardest room I've done - our team of 4 passed all of our exams in 40 minutes without any hints - but we were faster than most and I suspect most groups would need the whole hour.Overall I'd really recommend this for 'seasoned' escapers (as an experience rather than a challenge, necessarily) and first-timers (as a great introduction to the genre) alike."

I'm lucky to work with 5 colleagues who have similar tastes to me - so this made for a fantastically fun team exercise, and even better as a Harry Potter fan because I could appreciate all the little touches and nods to the canon! Although there are one or two things which show it is still in early stages (I think it opened a month ago) and could be tweaked to improve it, we found ourselves getting so into it. Finished in 45 minutes which we were proud of.As an aside, they went above and beyond to accommodate us - one of our colleagues turned up just as we were finishing and therefore missed the session. However the owners reset the rooms for us and let us back in to do a speedy version of the game. It was so kind and the late colleague was hugely appreciative!I recommend to friends, family with older kids (the younger kids might get a bit frustrated with how surprisingly tricky it is!) and colleagues alike. Not something for a solo trip - you wouldn't reach all the clues as one!"

This is more of a quest than an escape room in the fact that you have missions to complete, however the concept is the same. In the Harry Potter themed room you must solve clues to achieve passes in a variety of Witchcraft & Wizardry subjects.The clues and problems were brilliant and the technology behind the mechanisms is second to none. There is a great story and attention to detail is brilliant. Which sets you up for a truly magical experience.For me the real positive is the creators whose enthusiasm was infectious, I know that this room is just the beginning of even greater quests from Enigma Quests.I would recommend this to both newbies and experienced escape room participants.Me and my newly qualified witches and wizards cant wait to take on the bank heist."

As an experienced room-escaper, I should especially congratulate them on the quality of the puzzles and the whole story that leads to solve each of them.Little things could probably be improved, but they've just opened, so I expect them to learn from the experience of the players, and they are definitely leading the way in how escape rooms should be done.Highly recommended, even for non-Harry Potter fans.Also, very nice people :)"

This was a great quest that both older and younger (adults who still feel like kids!) members of the family enjoyed. The theme is any Harry Potter fan's dream - references to the books are definitely in there - but the quest doesn't rely on any knowledge of the books, it's open to all!The hosts were really friendly, welcoming us with offers of tea and coffee. We had a brief explanation of how the game would work before getting started. The puzzles are clever and at a good difficulty level, perhaps just slightly easier than Plan 52 at ClueQuest, but still with some red herrings along the way. Solving the puzzles was very satisfying - things did \"magically\" happen if you solved them correctly!The use of technology combined with the great design work and atmospheric decoration of the room works brilliantly. The way our hosts talked about the puzzles and the experience as a whole shows their enthusiasm and attention to detail. Clearly some very careful planning in making sure only the correct solution to a puzzle that allows you to proceed in the quest.The creators can be proud of designing and building a quest that stands up alongside more established escape rooms such as those at ClueQuest whilst doing so in their own way and with their own style. I look forward to the heist one being open!"

I must have played around 30 different rooms now across Europe, and this stacked up well. From the moment you arrive, it's clear the hosts are enthusiastic about and proud of their game. They were still decorating the reception and waiting areas, but once inside the room there were no worries on that front. Even better, you won't spend your time unlocking a tedious series of padlocks or cracking unrelated puzzles. All the puzzles relate to the main theme and felt natural in the room. There was a good variety and the solutions were very satisfying.If I had to criticise, it was probably that the totality of the puzzles was a little too easy - we got out with over twenty minutes to spare. That said, I think for most people you'll get close to an hour's entertainment, but for those who've done quite a few escape rooms, you might find it a little short for your liking. Caveat: they're still fine tuning the room, so while I don't expect major shifts, I can well imagine they'll add a little complexity to some of their puzzles to ratchet up the difficulty. I'm looking forward to them opening up other rooms - there's a combination of set design and mechanics that I've not seen in many escape companies."

I would say both rooms' difficulty were quite challenging yet not very difficult but you do have quite a number of locks to unlock.

For instance room 2 had a broken lock which when span got entrance to the next room with no clues being solved. There is also a very unclear part with a jacket with sewn in arrows. Unfortunately the arrows were ripped so we had to radio in. Overall it was fun but not sure it can justify the 26 gbp price compared to the more established places."

Because we were close to solving, they gave us 5 extra minutes. No prior knowledge of da Vinci is required. A very enjoyable experience. Don't be shy from asking for help over wallow talkie. They don't blurt out the stuff and are very helpful in a positive way. Overall a very good experience."

We tried the Mad Professor's room and it is definitely one of the better escape rooms in London. We have tried about 14 before. At the beginning, maybe the setting and the items are not as new or high tech as some of the other rooms out there and the theatre in the presentation was absent but if you are a purist and just want good quality puzzles that are different, this has them!! Very clever puzzles that are neither too hard or too simple and set at the right level for a good fun game. Creative as well with new different things from the usual. Okay, if you are looking for theatre or fancy toys then maybe go for something like Time Run or the latest ClueQuest room but if you are into just solving really good puzzles, this is the one!"

Only downside was there wasn't really any point of the plot in the end and the scene could have been set a bit better. But apart from that it was amazing. I recommend anyone to try.

A bit more crystal maze-esque!2) The waiting room is a bit shabby - I don't think it would take much to make it look a little more slick (same with all of the discarded furniture outside). It's East London chic I guess but I believe it made it look more amateur than it need be.Definitely would recommend!ThanksAlex"

This was my first Escape experience and I loved it. You and your team are \"trapped\" in a Steampunk themed room and you must solve the puzzles to make your escape. This escape game is packed with a variety of puzzles that must be solved within the hour, as indicated by the large clock on the wall. The puzzles themselves are a mixture of code breaking, logic and physical problems, but nothing too strenuous. While some puzzles are harder than others, all are solvable. This is an important consideration, as getting stuck can turn a fun activity into a frustrating one. Don\u2019t worry about getting stuck at Escape Land. The host is watching your every move and is available at the end of a walkie talkie to offer hints if you need them. He even offered us advice when we went too deeply into one puzzle, making it far more complicated than it actually was. Escape Land may seem a little off the beaten track but it\u2019s close to Cambridge Heath rail station and only a short walk from Bethnal Green tube station. There are a number of buses that serve the area and, as parking is difficult, I suggest using public transport. Our team of four had a great time and would recommend it to groups of friends, colleagues or families with older children."

Sometimes we needed to work together on one puzzle, and sometimes we focused on one puzzle each.

Most problems are logical puzzles, but there are also some manual dexterity obstacles too. There were two rooms to escape from to complete the full escape. We were almost out of the second room when time ran out. The owner gave us a few more minutes and we were able to fully escape.Well set up and great fun for the whole family.I could see this as being good for corporate team building too.It wasn't super easy to find at night, but well worth it.

So many little details you have to take note of... or wait, is that a red herring?Although you can have 5 people, I would suggest 3-4 is a better number (we were a group of 4) otherwise it would be a little bit short on space.Also I am a little smug as we had 6m 21secs to spare at the end and not everyone can escape in time.It's like the Crystal Maze but without the 80's hair-do's and jumpsuits."

I've now done five live escape games in London, two each at Hint Hunt and Clue Quest plus this one, and this is definitely right up there with the best.I have to say though, it didn't get off to a great start. The location isn't the most inspiring in the world, and the \"foyer\" doesn't have a patch on Clue Quest's new offices, but it's all about the room, isn't it?Of the rooms I've played, this is definitely the best in terms of theme. The Steampunk angle was a fun context for the game, and they'd woven it well into the puzzles.The puzzles themselves were varied and interesting - much less artificial than Hint Hunt's, although not as high tech and \"cool\" as Clue Quest's (but I guess with a Steampunk theme, that was inevitable). A couple of really fun puzzles, and some where teamwork was important which I think really added to the experience. The combination of the theme and the type of puzzles, definitely made me think of the Crystal Maze. In terms of difficulty I'd put these on the low side, but by no means easy - I can see people getting out in 40 minutes, but they're not going to breeze through. On the flip side, that means I believe all the puzzles are genuinely solvable, which is something I didn't feel at Hint Hunt.Bottom line: Clue Quest is probably better, but this is still very good and if you fancy something less about the tech and more about the theme then arguably better."

I was trying to book one of the venues closer to Central London but they were all full so we chanced this one. I'm glad we did as we suspended our disbelief for an hour and had a really fun time. We are a family of four (2 adults, 1 16 year old and 1 10 year old) and there was involvement for everyone. It's a 10-12 minute walk from Bethnal Green Tube station, just up from the V&A Museum Of Childhood so it's quite easy and quick to get to from Central London.A bit like a crossword, you sometimes have to get into the mindset of who sets the puzzles. We struggled a little bit at first but with a few hints we quickly got into our stride and managed to 'Escape' with just over four minutes to spare. We were rather chuffed!It cost us almost \u00a390, which is a lot, even for London, and we'd love to do another one but it would have to be a lot cheaper. For a family of four I'd pay \u00a360 to do one. I guess if you are a group of adults paying separately just over twenty quid each is pretty reasonable. Like with all things when you're paying for a family though, it normally comes out of only one pocket! But, cost, I'm glad we did it as it was a fun and challenging hour and something very different, think Crystal Maze with more of a low budget set!!"

Its amazing how quickly you start to find abstract as well as practical challenges the most important thing in the world when you are under a time limit and need to find a way out.Like many of the other reviewers we got loads of help and extra time but we did complete it and you get an enourmous sense of satisfaction from doing so and great - if a little strange - memories of teamwork and fun and achievement.My daughter absolutely loved it and so did we and what more can we ask for!!"

We only had three team members and didn't ask for clues until 30 minutes in but it was tricky! The man was very friendly and you didn't feel rushed at all which was great! He happily took photos and asked lots of questions about how we found the game and discussed other people's experiences! Lots of different types of challenges but the only thing I would change would be the opportunity to find more things... There were lots of locks but most of these required 4 number combinations to be obtained through solving puzzles and things which was great if you're a high level logically thinker but otherwise they were quite abstract and I did find myself getting a little frustrated- would have been great to have more of a mix of some being hidden but overall a great experience!"

The location was a bit challenging to find as google maps points you to a location across the street. Once we found it, the owner was friendly and helpful. We were locked into a room supplied with a piece of paper on a clipboard, a pen, and a walkie talkie incase we got stuck. We then had an hour to try to escape. The first room was challenging and the puzzles were very fun. The second room also had some fun puzzles but was overall less challenging (or we had gotten the hang it). With three people we managed to finish with just 3 minutes to spare. We really enjoyed ourselves and recommend it to everyone."

Turn right into Partimer and look for Seth Court about 100m on the left.The place is basically an industrial unit which has been set up as a couple of rooms with a varity of puzzles in. The host, who watches your progress via cameras, offers hints if you struggle to keep things moving - although in our case we felt we were nowhere near at a dead end before he helped out - maybe we were a little behind where we should've been at that point in order to get out in the hour?The puzzles where all solveable but could do with a little tweaking to help with which solution code opened which lock.We really enjoyed the experience and would recommend it to anyone - our team was 2 adults and a 13 and 14 year old."

Anyway, that's our excuse for not getting out in time despite a fair amount of help and an extra five minutes!Regardless of that, we had an amazing time and it's great fun being challenged to think laterally while trying to take in everything else that's going on. Being a bit slow to start only meant we had to really kick into gear at the half way mark! Having a mix of ages and left hand/right hand brain thinkers would help a lot so go in numbers!The room host was brilliant, pointing us in the right direction and helping out when we were unable to do some stuff. Our 12 year old loved it especially when we got to the very last part and tried to open the door, her face when she realised she knew where the final key was made it a priceless experience!"

I've been to other escape games and this definitely ranked among the top! I especially loved the steampunk theme. Also, the puzzles had varying levels of difficulty which means everyone in a group can contribute in some way,not only the intelligent ones!I have to give special mention to the host, who was especially accommodating and understanding the whole way through. In comparison to other escape games I've been to, he knew exactly when to provide hints when needed. This is a huge boon especially when you consider in other escape games, the host does not know when to interject or when to leave you to your own devices. Bad hosts leave you stuck in a dead-end for 20 minutes or refuse to provide hints because it's 'against the rules', turning what should be a fun activity into a frustrating one. But this host was absolutely on-point with his valuable (!!) inputs which helped to keep the flow of the game going,and he always respected your intelligence all the way through.I cannot stress the importance of a good host enough, you can have the best puzzles in the world but if it cannot be solved, then it wont be appreciated!

Since visiting yesterday I've decided I don't need a reason - will definitely be going back. Oh my goodness...did we ever have a great time?! Two 12 year olds and two adults, we booked the medium difficulty challenge. Having completed this I would gauge the lower age limit at 11/12 unless you want to spend a lot of time explaining everything to your younger kids. It's clean, well equipped and professionally run.We were greeted at the door by Luke, who was to be our 'guide/coordinator/handler' and he ran through the basics; he didn't seem put off by my \"is there a panic buttons because I sometimes get claustrophobic and will we be plunged into darkness and left to die in a tiny space\" type questions. In total you have three rooms to \"escape\" from. At first, never having done this before, we spent a fair bit of time looking at each other in a \"what the hell?\" manner, but once we solved the first clue we were up and running. It doesn't take long before you're totally engrossed and even if we had been plunged into darkness I would have been rallying the others to carry on. We laughed, we worked as a team, we ran around like headless chickens, we solved clues, we inappropriately shouted at our kids...it was the most fun we have had for a long time. Loved it. Still laughing about it. Book it. Go. Now. You won't regret it. Thanks Luke and team...we will be back very soon!"

There's a lot of rooms escapes in London, it sometimes amazes me that some people still haven't even heard of a room escape.I've played a lot of the London ones now and so have experienced several different companies and seen the things that they get right and wrong. I think I can say that Clue Quest is the definite 2nd best in London (beaten only by the breath-taking Time Run.)Clue Quest has 3 games, (numerous copies of each), and I've played all 3.They're all solid and full of fun and innovative puzzles, often making excellent use of technology and cool mechanical puzzles too.There is a fun and silly spy theme running through all three, which gives a nice and consistent branding to the whole thing.The staff are always super friendly and the briefings always thorough and clear. Perhaps occasionally a bit too thorough... I would recommend for more experienced players keeping the briefings a bit more... brief.My favourite of the three games is their newest one; Revenge of the Sheep. It just has some really lovely ideas and puzzles in it, and a few bits of technology and hidden surprises that will make you go \"ooooh wow ok that's very cool!\" when they emerge.great for new and experienced players alike. The only problem with new players starting off with Clue Quest is that if they get the bug and want to try other escape game companies, many of of the others will seem a bit lacklustre or shoddy in comparison."

The game-masters did the briefing expertly, and got us quickly into the room.The room itself is fun, and has a lot of riddles, so even though we are experienced, it did take us almost the entire 60 minutes to escape (using several clues)...Compared to some of the other rooms we did, it is considered a non-technological room (meaning: mainly locks and padlocks), but it was still very fun.At the end we got our secret-agent card, as well as some magnets with our pictures on them.I would recommend it to 3 experienced players or 3-5 non-experienced."

We did \"red box\".As first timers we were a bit nervos about what would happen but the staff are fantastic. There is someone on the end of a radio at all times if you need anything, and you are able to leave the room whenever you want (but your time is still ticking). We had a wheelchair user as part of our group and the staff we very helpful. They use a moving platform to get down stairs where there are a number of rooms accessible to wheelchair users. Great games to play with family and friends.We will be back "

My boyfriend and I had our first try at a live escape room on holiday in Thailand and absolutely fell in love with the concept, whilst our friends who are also a couple had tried out Lady Chastity's Revenge in London and spoke so highly of that experience too. So we had been talking about trying another all together for a while, there are so many out there now to choose from but we ended up picking ClueQuest based on it being no.1 on TripAdvisor, and it DEFINITELY deserves that ranking. We went last night after dinner and a couple of drinks and being all puzzle-lovers went (optimistically!) for the hardest of the challenges with Revenge of the Sheep. Sophia looked after us and was absolutely lovely, definitely enhanced the whole experience for us, she clearly has a genuine passion for her work and had us chuckling along and getting into the spirit of the storyline before we even went in, and afterwards there was no sense of - cool so you're done now bye! Instead she gave us our awesome team photo and talked to us about more live puzzles to try and her experiences which was so helpful - we're definitely going to be trying some based on her advice!Of course I won't give much away about the room itself but I will say the production values inside the room are fantastic, the attention to detail, the number and variety of puzzles to solve is amazing. It was the quickest hour of my life! But also one of the most exhilarating and fun. You won't be disappointed, it's worth every penny.Thanks again to Sophia and the ClueQuest team!! If you design a new room at the same difficulty level or harder (haha) we'll be back in a flash xx"

You can feel like a genius one second as you final solve a clue and really stupid the next when you realise the answer was in front of you the whole time. Our host was excellent, incredibly friendly and a real credit to Cluequest. I have to apologies as I didn't make a good note of his name (I think I was still to excited from my escapades in the room) but I think his name was Far? His contribution helped make the whole experience. The rooms aren't particular small and I don't believe anybody suffering from Claustrophobia will have any issues.

Our host James was really friendly and helpful, he gave us a clear introduction and also helped us with some clues along the way via walkie talkie when we got really stuck. I got in a flap about the time running out towards the end, but the rest of the family were focused and we managed to work well as a team getting out with 1 min 18 secs to spare. We were told this was really good for first timers.Now we can't wait to go back and tackle the other 2 rooms. I highly recommend it, it's certainly an activity to challenge the little grey cells and something that genuinely appeals to all ages.We went on a Sunday afternoon, and to wind down afterwards (it's a bit stressful, but in a fun way) we wandered along the canal to Granary Square and drank hot chocolate and caught Pokemon before heading home."

We were then locked into our suite of rooms and needed to use all our nous to get ourselves out - subtly helped by Harriett over the wire at various key points when we were starting to flounder. It was much harder than we expected and infinitely more fun. The fact that we all enjoyed it a lot - with our ages ranging from 27 to 66 - says a lot about the appeal of this entertainment.

The briefing was ok, the lady overseeing us gave helpful hints at what felt like were the correct times and it was good to 'debrief' with her afterwards.Really looking forward to completing the remaining 2 rooms! Can't wait!Tip: Make sure the scribe is someone reliable!"

Only once were we actively told what to do, but that's probably because it was a really difficult part. The rest of the time we were pointed in the right direction to get us back on track. When I accidentally broke one of the puzzles they added an extra couple of minutes to help. At the end we had a team photo taken, which were given as a fridge magnet and a couple of spares."

You are locked in a room (don't worry, it's not claustrophobic) and you have to search the room for clues, keys and passwords. Think crystal maze with a bit of Sherlock thrown in. I won't spoil the ending but there is a countdown clock to try to beat. We'll definitely be going back. It's a short activity, great for slotting in with other things to do that day.

We were a family of four, with two daughters 15 and 12, and we really enjoyed our experience at ClueQuest. The website makes booking simple, and gives you all the information you need, and the site is easy to find (and makes a nice highlight to a day out in the newly redeveloped Kings Cross area of London). We arrived a bit early, but we were made instantly welcome. An initial introduction to the game and then we were led into our ClueQuest room - there is secure space for belongings in the room. Essentially this is a locked room puzzle experience, and you need to search for clues and try and work out lock combinations and puzzles in order to progress through to the exit. No background knowledge, nor any items of general knowledge are assumed - which means that all members of the family can be involved and play a full and equal part. Although you are in a locked room, to prepare those who might be wary of the concept, you can reassure them that there is always an easy way to get out whenever you wish. Our children absolutely loved the mystery, and ransacking the room to look for clues, then working together to solve the puzzles and deactivate the locks. We were given a walkie-talkie to ask for additional clues if we got stuck, but as a family we wanted not to resort to this, and we were able to complete the challenge with seconds to spare only having to ask for one hint right at the end (it turns out that we had found everything we needed, but just had not spotted one element which had been sitting under our noses!) The whoops of joy from the whole family when we opened the last door at the last minute told their own story. Great fun. Afterwards we had a debrief, and were presented with a few photo reminders of our day. I am sure we will be back to try the other two quests. I would have not hesitation in recommending this."

Without breaking character once, Jamie totally immersed us into the high energy and against the clock 'doomsday' experience. The game was fantastic fun, and was brilliant for developing teamwork and problem solving skills. Interestingly enough, an eclectic mix of personalities in our group allowed us to complete all tasks effectively - some taking a more mathematical approach, and others from a creative 'outside the box' angle.

Jamie (the lovely enthusiastic young man that was our designated host) was great and did a great job of setting the scene and making the build up to going in the room informative and fun. The room itself had clever puzzles and riddles which required team brain storming to figure out. Some of it was really challenging and some we figured out by accident. Over all we had great time and would definately go back to try the other experiences. (we chose the Mr Q yellow experience- can't remember its official name at this moment). Its family friendly but was still great fun for my friends and I (ladies in our 30s).Highly recommended."

I've done two of ClueQuest's escape rooms now - Plan 52 with a team of 11 year olds for my son's birthday and Operation Blacksheep with my son and teen daughter and a friend with her son and teen daughter. Both experiences were excellent, and got rave reviews from all involved. It's an expensive way to spend an hour, but worthwhile. The walk along Regents Canal back to St Pancras is very pleasant - we picnicked there with sandwiches from the NISA opposite ClueQuest."

ClueQuest is a facility that houses three different escape rooms with 9 total rooms designed for teams of 3 (89 pounds, 79 off peak for 26.30 per person) to 5 (109 pounds, 99 off peak, 19.80 per person) people with an option to add a sixth person (19.80). Book early online (a few months) especially in the summer to reserve a spot. My wife and I have done both Plan 52 (in 2015) and Operation Blacksheep (this year) rooms. Be aware that groups of 2 will be pay for the group of 3 price. Teams of 2 will have a harder time but we finished both rooms with the guidance of our handlers. Handlers communicate with teams using walkie talkies. The clues given by the handlers are meant to assist not give away answers. Both rooms have space but may a little tight with 6 players. You can opt for a team picture made into a magnet as a keepsake for 3 pounds and sign the books located at the front of the facility. There is tube access to ClueQuest that takes about 15 minutes to walk so plan accordingly. It was a lot of fun and we plan on completing the last room next year. You're going down Professor Blacksheep."

If you're not used to escape rooms, the premise is simple: you and your party get locked in a room and you have an hour to solve a series of problems / clues / tasks in order to 'escape.' There are several escape rooms around London, but ClueQuest have the slickest operation and excellent game mechanics in the rooms. No spoilers here, but our room involved plenty of puzzles to keep 5 adults very busy for the entire time, as well as a number of genuine 'wow' moments. The staff are excellent, very friendly, and able to lend a hand (via walkie talkie) if you need a hint. The escape rooms are well equipped and designed, and provide an excellent level of challenge. This is perfect for a group of friends, or a family (especially good for teenagers and older kids), with team building, problem solving and a genuine hit of excitement as you work your way through the challenges. ClueQuest is the best value for money attraction I've been to in London and you won't be disappointed. It'll also give you something to talk about for hours afterwards. Most London attractions that are hell-bent on parting you and your cash will try to make you buy a souvenir photo at the end. At ClueQuest, they gave us each a free one as a parting gift. I think that sums up the attention to detail and focus on a great player experience that this place has. I would advise booking well in advance, especially for peak time - these guys are rightly very popular and they do get booked up. They currently offer 3 different themed rooms here, so I'll definitely be back very soon. Fabulous day out, loads of fun, couldn't recommend it more highly."

Together with my partner and my 15 year old nephew, we had a blast defeating the evil black sheep in the Revenge of the Sheep Unit 2 quest.We had done a few secret rooms in London and Switzerland before, but this room clearly stands out. First, we were all deeply immersed in the game thanks to the sounds in the background (very stressful at time) and the fact that the enigma made sense in the general quest. The flow of solving the enigma was natural, we could solve enigma in our own order (some in parallel).The setup was superb, bespoke to the last detail and poetic (ala Myst video game). The enigma requires the best of all your sense to get through.Overall a captivating and highly immersive escape room which we'd recommend to anyone. There are other quests that we can't wait to discover as well. Highly addictive! So happy to have turned the evil Professor black sheep into Haggis ;-)"

None of them had done anything like this before and were unsure what to expect. After the briefing from the young staff which they were all attentive to, they entered the room and were off on the adventure. As the girls were under 16 they had to be accompanied in the room by an adult something we had not been warned of beforehand. However it was great to be a fly on the wall. Our eldest daughter went into Mission control for a fee and watched the proceedings on cctv...Which she loved. Cannot praise the staff and experience highly enough.

The design of the game was excellent, spanning three chambers, while the methods were challenging yet not overly complex. I was pleased to see that ClueQuest has retained a focus on locks, keys and codes, and each part of the game flowed together with enviable attention to detail. We will certainly be back to try the other two rooms. Elsewhere, the staff were very friendly and really made our time enjoyable. At almost \u00a325 per person, it isn't something you would do every week; realistically it is a little overpriced, but not by much.

The waiting room was also full of boxed games, allowing those who had turned up early the opportunity to get in the right headspace.Finally, a big shout-out to our guide Jamie, who showed the perfect balance of enthusiasm, explaining things well without feeling patronising, and providing useful hints, but only when they were truly necessary."

Remember that - if it's too complex for a kid, it's not a clue! There's 3 different rooms, the clue based (Sherlock Holmes-esque) entry level room, a bit trickier Bond-villain lair, and a super hard Mission Impossible style which apparently has only a 10% success rate!When they say a room, it's actually 2.5 rooms, once you'v completed one you get a better idea how to approach the next. If you get stuck your guide will offer some clues (or prove a distraction...)Bigger groups can apparently go head to head in a who gets out first.Anyhow, choose your team wisely, and keep your head as the clock ticks to zero!"

Like most reviewers my wife and I have done a number of escape rooms in London and New York and have to say ClueQuest is up there with the best of them. The game was well organised, followed through and kept twisting and turning. I went with my mum and day (both in their 60s) who had never done a game before, they both really enjoyed it and came out wanting to do another game.As with all of the good games you have to book months in advance to get a weekend slot so it is not really a last minute idea.The comma from ClueQuest were excellent and despite what was said in the email the location was really simple to find as they have a whole shop front.Will be booking for another game very soon"

Half our party arrived 15 minutes late, but the staff were welcoming, accommodating and kind throughout. The waiting area is comfortable, and drinking water is provided. We were briefed by two gentlemen, and then taken to our rooms. Each group had one kid, aged 9 and 13. The game itself is brilliantly designed, with plenty of clues and hints provided when necessary. When you've cracked the clues in the first room you get to unlock another, and have to solve the puzzles and mysteries in that room. I will be honest and admit that neither team managed to escape, and had to be helped by the staff to get out of the rooms. But that hasnt put any one of us off doing it again. It really is an experience worth doing, and the professional and courteous service provided makes it all worthwhile. In the end they gave us photos of our teams to take home, which was a lovely gesture.The only thing I think could be improved upon is the fact that the clues seem really random, i.e. there doesnt seem to be a narrative, a story, connecting them all. One doesnt naturally and organically lead to another, so that a story emerges and makes sense and propels you toward more clues - something like a picture that emerges as you start to put a puzzle together. Here, no picture actually emerged. One last thing - the parking (metered) on the road is good (surprising for London!), we were able to find 2 parking spaces with ease at a busy time of 3 PM.Thank you for a lovely experience that really took our Eid from good to great. My kids are hard to please and they were raving about it all day long, and cant wait to do another escape room."

The staff are also really helpful and passionate about their work. Having visited many room escape experiences now, we would highly recommend clueQuest. It is in an easy to access location, right next door to a bus stop and only about 1 km from Kings Cross Station. We took a nice walk along the canals to get there. All in all, great value for money and really worth doing. They have three experiences to choose from, and we had a great time saving the world with Operation Black Sheep!

You are allocated a quest guide as well who can communicate through a walkie talkie if you get stuck and if for any reason you want out there is an exit button.

We managed to solve the room in 40 minutes (nearly making a top 5 time), but were told the room has a less than 50% success rate, so try it and see if you can beat it!Very fun, lots of different types of puzzles, some requiring a team effort to solve. You get a real rush of adrenaline for the hour. Would recommend a team size of 3-5 people. 2 isn't enough and 6+ will feel cramped."

He explained little bits, hints and what the aim of the game was. We were put in a room and without giving too much away we had to find clues to open the next door, to open the other door to get out the room. As you go along you will become more aware of clues and how to find the bits to open the doors. Everyone got involved when we were struggling, and when we felt we had hit a dead end we got hints to get us back on track. The whole game was so clever and carefully planned. A lot of time and effort has been made to insure all goes to plan and no one blows up the apartment. Very pleased with our team effort and would definitely go back again. Ten thumbs up from us all."

We went to Clue Quest as the birthday boy of 10 wanted to go with his friends. The idea is that you are all secret agents (you're even given names) and you have to enter a series of rooms to discover the identity of a double agent by finding clues and cracking codes. You're also against the clock as the double agent has set off some kind of device. A member of staff is assigned to help you with clues via walkie talkie if you get stuck. Staff walk you through the activity at the beginning and recap your mission once you're done. The staff are friendly, informative and engage well with the children and adults alike.The actual rooms are brilliantly laid out and set the scene for a great story. It's immersive, captures the imagination and keeps everyone engaged. The whole experience reminded me of modern Cluedo but in realtime. I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for something to do with the kids of want a fun afternoon out as part of a birthday."

I have now completed all 3 existing rooms: PLAN 52, Operation Blacksheep and Revenge of the Sheep. If you have never been to Cluequest before, I would recommend attempting the challenges in this order. The storyline leads from one to the other in this order, but is NOT essential to know the storyline if you did want to attempt them in a different sequence. From personal experience, I found PLAN 52 the easiest (yet still a challenge), and Operation Blacksheep the most difficult! (we almost didn't escape this one) - but of course, it depends on your strength of teamwork, and the number of people in your room too! I personally found the 6 people in a room felt crowded (we had this for Operation Blacksheep) and 4-5 JUST the right amount. Having too many people means you miss out on some clues (especially if communication is bad!), however the positive side to this is that you can always experience the room again and solve different clues/sections for yourself!I have also completed rooms at various other escape rooms such as HintHunt and TimeRun for example, but there is obviously a good reason as to why I keep returning to ClueQuest :) I await their next challenge with anticipation!"

James our games maker was excellent. He really sold us the narrative about the game, and was really good at making sure we had fun. We left feeling very elated and bonded despite having been strangers an hour before! I would love to do something like this again."

I think that is the best minimum number.The guy who introduced us & explained everything was very friendly & efficient. They do watch you via some sort of cctv & so see when you're stuck & can offer clues if needed via walkie talkie so you don't get frustrated! ( it was actually a nice help) We are not the best latteral thinkers but we manages to get out as we were so close to the end we were given an extra few minutes! :-) We manages in 1 hour & 5 minutes in the end. There seems to be a stair lift down to the toilet area & i thing to where some rooms are so i think if you're in a wheel chair there are specific rooms that are designated for you. We actually went with a pushchair & the staff were great. They carried it for us up the 5 or 6 steps to the room we used.There is nothing 'physical' to do so we managed with the baby in a sling! But if he'd been sleeping its just you in the secure room so we could have left him in the pushchair as we did the quest. Huge fun & i felt like i had a brain workout whwen i'd finished. Definatly will go back for another room!!!"

The min we walked in you actually felt excited as you didn't know what to expect and by the time we were assigned to our mission we were all raring to go. Brilliant and very taxing,it really tests ur brain as there are so many things to work out and only a given time to do it which also makes it more exciting. Only 2 complaints really, one was I really don't think you get enough time and the other is don't take my old mate Steve. He is a clown and with all the clues we had to figure out I couldn't help laughing at him as it reminded me of our school days. And we wasn't very bright then or now as we didn't crack it but it wasn't for the want of trying.

After failing (reasonably miserably) at my first attempt, I went back to Cluequest to see if a different room, and different team would improve my escaping skills. Operation BlackSheep is a similar set up to Plan 52, with several levels of frustrating, interspersed with fleeting victories. Happily, we managed to free ourselves with only a minute or two to spare, but things definitely got a lot more panicky in the last ten or so minutes. I'd definitely recommend playing the rooms in order (perhaps this one felt easier as you're just more familiar with the set up and have a vague idea of what is expected of you). Overall, we loved it and I can't wait to go back and attempt the most recent addition."

The 'story' was a bit tenuous, and in fact we didn't actually find the answer to it - it became more about escaping the room. The setup of the room/s was excellent and there was lots to do. My mum was a bit nervous about coming along as she didn't think she'd like being trapped in a room, and wasn't confident she'd know what to do. However, there was so much to look at, and so many potential clues to find, she was fine. The walkie talkie system worked well in giving us hints when we'd missed something obvious. Would love to know what happens if you DON'T solve the problem to escape! Thoroughly recommmend - we went for dinner afterwards and it was all we talked about!"

With other rooms, people can be doing different tasks at the same time. That being said, it's great fun! We had a boys team versus a girls team and, yet again, the girls won!"

We played the game as a group of 6 (wide age range from early 20s to mid 60s) and all really enjoyed the game! I've played 2 escape games before, however this one was noticeably different. Without going into too much detail (don't want to ruin the surprise!), the d\u00e9cor of the room, range of interactions you had with the clues and creativity shown in some of the props/clues was superb. It was our choice to go against the recommendation and play as a 6 because we wanted to all be involved, however I'd say the optimum group size is about 4 - that gives everyone enough to do, without stretching the team too much. The game is designed to suit children and adults, some elements are looking for hidden objects, others are solving clues. The game is heavily themed and follows a narrative which I really enjoyed, it perhaps means however, that after completing all 3 games on offer you'd have to wait for a new game to be initiated to spark your interest. After the game we got a couple of nice tokens from the staff to take home to remember our experience by, a lovely touch. The facilities are modern, clean and spacious - this differs from some of the other escape games I've done which have clearly been done on a very low budget and are like going to someone's flat! A great experience - we escaped with 4 minutes to spare, thanks to the team for making my brother's birthday so much fun!"

We were greeted at the door by a very friendly member of staff and were shown to some seats whilst the Clue quest concept was explained to us by Will, a very friendly and helpful member of the team, little did we know he would be a bit of a hero to us throughout our experience. We were then shown to our \"room\" where our challenge began and without giving too much away I can say we were met with lots of different challenges and clues to help us work out who the spy was and help us escape out of the room. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to try something different or just fancy a fun evening out, we can't wait to go back and try another \"room\"."

We had 2 adults and 1 ten year old, we found it very challenging but lots of fun. We will be talking about the clues for ages. I think 3 or 4 people would work best, any more and you may start arguing. There is just so much going on at times is seems overwhelming but you gradually work out each clue. It is very easy to get to from kings cross and makes me want to try another escape game again."

The anticipation of being locked in another set of rooms and trying to escape from them in under an hour had us all buzzing with excitement. We were not disappointed, Plan 52 was fiendishly clever and we had so much fun finding our way out. We did much better than our last mission and found the help given to us by our wonderful guide was just right to keep us moving forward. If I could, I would give ClueQuest a 5+ rating as the whole experience is brilliantly managed. The staff in the centre are charming, patient and superb hosts. We will treasure the photo they took of us after our escape (it looks like we have all just run a marathon) and the family-building experience we shared. Keep up the good work guys!"

The staff are very enthusiastic and encourage you to get in the right frame of mind to become an excellent game player. Before you know it you are in the room from which you must escape and the clock is ticking. No spoilers here but Operation Blacksheep is a brilliant quest and it left you wanting to do another immediately afterwards because you learnt something about yourself and your group when you were puzzling your way out! What a fabulous experience which has been carefully tailored to meet a wide audience. I would highly recommend and cant wait to go back to escape again!"

We completed Plan 52 with 8 minutes to spare, and Operation BlackSheep with 12. Close enough to make it exciting, but not so close that we were scratching each other's eyes out! I genuinely think this is the best way to spend an hour, quite possibly the most fun I've ever had! I didn't know how Operation BlackSheep was going to live up to how amazing Plan 52 was, but if anything it exceeded expectations! I cannot recommended ClueQuest enough, and we will definitely be returning for Revenge of the Sheep."

We booked two 'rooms' of the original adventure and comprised one group of mixed adults/teens and one group of 11-12 year olds. The support provided to both groups by staff was excellent, the level of the challenges varied and appropriate - and inclusive to all present. As groups need to be getting on with a number of tasks simultaneously, there was little space for any individuals to dominate either group, which was a relief in relation to the 11-12 year olds! I can see this being enjoyable for adults of any age, and tweenie children and above."

Once you're done and the fun is over you're in an interesting part of town: we went for a lovely short walk down by the canal, admiring the canal boats, and had a glass of Champers in St Pancras to top it all off.

            "review": "Revenge of the Sheep - another fantastic game from ClueQuest!. I've been playing escape rooms for two and a half years now, and during that time I've played over 50 games. I've played amazing games, I've played terrible games and pretty much everything in between. It's safe to say that ClueQuest is right up there with the best of them. In the London scene it's one of my three favourite games (and I've played 30+), and the other two in the group are both significantly more expensive at \u00a330-40 per person.If you've never played an escape room before, then start with Operation Blacksheep or Plan 52 which are a little easier, but still great quality games. Their best game, though, is definitely the new addition, \"Revenge of the Sheep\". It's a wonderful mix of puzzles spanning a wide range of types, from mechanical to technological and from obvious to subtle. They've judged the difficulty level perfectly - I think this will be a good challenge for any escapers, whatever their experience - you *can* get out without clues, but it will be incredibly tough! Don't be afraid of playing because it sounds difficult though - your games maker will be on hand to help you if you get stuck.Speaking of which, the games makers are all very friendly and do a great job before and after. You really get the feeling that they're part of the team and not just employees going through the motions - they seemed genuinely excited when we escaped!I'm not sure why you're still reading - go and book your game!"

We have completed 4 other escape games in the past, but hadn't got around to trying either of the other cluequest games. After playing the new game I can definitely say we will be back at some point to complete the other two!First off the waiting area is very welcoming and the staff are super friendly, making us feel at ease while we waited to start our game.The briefing was clear, and then we were off!Can't say too much as I don't want to spoil any surprises but the puzzles were fun and there were a few surprises along the way which we really enjoyed.After we completed our mission, the staff sat with us for a while and discussed the game, and their enthusiasm for the job really shone through.Will definitely be back!"

As long term Cluequest fans we couldn't wait to get our hooves on Revenge of the Sheep and I'm pleased to say their third game is absolutely amazing. It makes better use of advanced technology than ever and without giving anything away there are a few genuine 'wow' moments throughout the time in the room. The Cluequest team are massively welcoming, enthusiastic and have a brilliant new home just north of Kings Cross. All three Cluequest adventures share the same theme and characters which really sets them apart from the competition. If you've done a CQ adventure before then you'll love Revenge of the Sheep - if you're new to CQ or escape games altogether you're definitely in for a treat too.Highly recommended."

ClueQuest is brilliant!It's like a cross between the Crystal Maze and Kryptonfactor but to really enjoy it the first time, don't read up to much about it - not fully knowing what to expect is part of what makes it so great the first time.My mates and I have done the first two challenges and with a third challenge launching this month, we have plans to go again.A lot of thought has gone into ClueQuest - not just the challenge itself, but the staff, atmosphere, decor and little extras.One bit of advice, ClueQuest is based a bus journey from Kings Cross Station and the particular area it is set up in is a bit of a dive. So if you want food/drinks beforehand, go somewhere else - you won't find anywhere decent near ClueQuest."

Somehow, our session that I booked over four months ago was over-booked, so they got us to trial the new game 'Revenge of Black Sheep'. This was the first of these 'scape room' games that we have played, so we didn't know what to expect. They watched us find the clues and if we were spending too long in an area or getting stuck, they gave us hints so we would solve the game in time. We had a really fun time, but I have to give it a 4 out of 5 because we had to trial this as the game we booked (52) was over-booked. We did receive passes for our next game for free though, but for the inconvenience, I have to score a 4...I'd give it 4.5 out of five though just for the mess-up."

We explained to him at the end that we had been to another escape in Birmingham (Escape Live) and had since been informed that some of the puzzles there were copied from clue quest. This did mean that we had a slight helping hand with a couple of the puzzles inside the room, but as there were only two of us it was a good help along the way. Michael was great with hints and tips giving us a nudge along the way when we were struggling, but didn't make things too easy for us either. We managed to escaped after being given a little bit of extra time as we were on the final puzzle at 60 minutes we managed to get out after another 4 added minutes. We will definitely be back to clue quest to try out the other games, the only downside is there is no option for two players meaning we did have to pay the extra for 3 people which is a shame. However to make up for it we each got a free magnet with our picture on. This was a really nice touch. Although this game did work out more expensive for us as a two I wouldn't mind paying the extra again for such a good game. There is clearly a lot of time and effort put in here and the hospitality was great too."

This is one of the best escape games I've done (I think I've done 9 now across England/New York) & one of the few we've managed to escape from.Short walk from Kings Cross Station, nothing too far, easy to find no problems there and the exterior has good signage so you know exactly where you're heading. Really friendly welcome by the staff, made us feel at ease offered us use of the toilets and a drink etc really nice which you don't always get. The puzzles were quite challenging at the start but we always seem to suffer with brain freeze when we start these games! Unfortunately we were kinda given an unfair advantage as many of the elements in this game have been stolen by a company in Birmingham which we did discuss with the 'Game Masters' at the end of the game.I Won't give any spoilers for the puzzles or the story of the game but there are different puzzles in this game that I've not seen anywhere else! Our 'Game Master' would occasionally throw us a hint on the TV when we were in need which was helpful as it was like he actually wanted us to escape where as other companies just leave you to it. We were only a two but we managed to escape with an additional 4 or so minutes I Can't quite remember, would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking at trying one of these games, we will definitely be back for more, just a pity that we have to pay for 3 people as we are only ever a duo but we did get some fridge magnets which is another thing not offered by other escape games.Our 'Game Master' was Michael he was a hoot, really nice, helpful and friendly, hopefully he's gone and researched this Birmingham game we informed him of.Will be back to play more!"

The room was great. Very few red herrings. Structured with several discrete stages. Clever puzzles and problems requiring teamwork and good communication. It does look like most people make it out though (all 14 of us made it out), so perhaps it can be a bit longer? Though, definitely a great experience and can't recommend it enough!

Visited ClueQuest for my friends birthday at the weekend where we put ourselves into teams of 4 or 5 as there was 13 of us that went.We all played the same escape game so that we were all doing the same thing and could have a bit of banter about who won!Without giving too much away I have to say it was a fantastic game and a really enjoyable mix of logic, problem solving and providing you all get along, working as a team! The tasks were well thought out and keep you on your toes, plus if you know your up against others in another room it made us want to beat them more!The whole time we were there I really enjoyed it and would happily go back again to try a different game.I suppose if I had to be critical it is quite expensive at \u00a320 each when you think there could be 5 in a room which is \u00a3100 straight away. However I suppose there is costs for running and maintaining the place plus paying the staff who run it. For the enjoyment level though I did not begrudge paying it.I would strongly recommend ClueQuest to anyone who wants a fun hour or so trying something you don't do every day. Oh and my team won to make it that bit better!"

The words 'team building exercise' probably strike fear into people; too many bad experiences doing improvisations at business seminars, and being asked to \"think outside the box\".But here's a chance to do a team building exercise where you really do have to think to get out of the box!!! Obviously Escape Games have become incredibly popular of late and if you grew up on shows like Crystal Maze and Fort Boyard and thought \"I want to do that!\" then you will love this.The premise is ridiculous, (you must help a mouse defeat an evil sheep), but the silliness is part of this games charm. Obviously I can't say too much about the puzzles but they really got our small team thinking and really forced us to play to each other's strengths. Having done similar games before in larger groups unsuccessfully. I would recommend doing it in a smallish group - 4 seemed to work really well for us. It was interesting to see that there was another group there that split into two teams to race against each other as well as the clock. The staff were very friendly and enthusiastic and genuinely seemed pleased for our success. After a tough year at work, it was nice to go and do something fun, slightly ridiculous and different. A thoroughly enjoyable afternoon - I would have give it 5 stars even if we hadn't managed to complete it!!!"

All three of us absolutely loved this, great set up as you enter, the staff assistants was very helpful, welcoming and informative and the rooms themselves are well planned and thought out and the puzzles and riddles enabled us to work as a team. The clues were helpful at the appropriate time and we felt so many moments of victory once we'd solved the next clue, right up until our victorious finish! Cannot recommend this highly enough and is worthy of all the amazing review's it's received, will be back to try one of the other challenges!!"

She and four friends were shown the room where they had to escape from. They had 60 minutes to do it. I sat and read my book whilst I waited. I could hear screams of enjoyment from the room during the time. When they escaped they were full of excitement from the experience. They all want to go back and do more. The staff were lovely and really played the part. Well done to everyone. See you soon."

I booked this as a birthday gift voucher for my 15 year old daughter, it was easy to book on-line with very good communication and a handy email reminder the day before with directions.We took the train to Kings cross station and walked about 10 mins up Caledonian road.The staff were friendly and welcoming and introduced the concept of the game.The four of us really enjoyed the game and I think the combination of quick moving and thinking teenagers (15yrs and 19yrs) worked well with their slower more methodical middle aged parents.It was challenging, exciting and fairly pressurised.The hints came just at the right time and we were happily given 3 extra minutes so we could solve the puzzle ourselves which gave us all a sense of satisfaction.I liked that we had the opportunity to discuss our game with the staff afterwards and the fridge magnet given as a memento.We would all like to go back and try the other game. Its not cheap for a family but great as a present or with a group of friends ( who pay for themselves !!)"

Planning an annual few days in London, we were looking for something a bit different. The reviews we read on Trip Advisor convinced us that this was the closest we might ever get to the Crystal Maze, although my husband remained a bit sceptical about it being particularly challenging, or even that much fun.It seems to be something that attracts mainly adults, and lots of office parties towards Christmas, but we braved it with our 4 children of 15, 13,11 and 10 (the youngest they have seen there, we were told). All I can say is, we all completely, totally loved every minute of the mad, frenzied hour. Even my husband was hugely impressed by the thought that has gone into ClueQuest, and the resulting game. What was really astonishing is that all 6 of us worked together (sometimes in a fairly haphazard way!), and there was not one single argument or stressful word said during the hour (or rather the 58 minutes which it took us to escape!). We just could not believe how much fun it was, and how quickly the time went.Do NOT miss this if you have a family that enjoys puzzles, solving clues, any kind of mental challenge. We cannot recommend it highly enough. My 10 year old daughter has asked top go back for her birthday next autumn, and I can say with certainty that we absolutely will be back to try one of the other challenges (we were told that a third is starting in the spring 2016 - hooray!).Thank you for a really brilliant time - we are still talking about it more than anything else we have done for ages."

Well firstly, don't keep it a surprise...the birthday boys I treated thought we were off to football!After the initial disappointment, the team (4 adults and 2 children aged 13 and 14) really got into it.One hour locked in a series of rooms, clue and code breaking.Good fun...with three minutes to spare (though we did need help!).clueQuest have a variety of missions, so I would definitely return again.Top tip, without giving too much away, just because you have left a room doesn't mean that the clues you have found should be left behind."

The two fellows running the place were so kind, informative and seemed like they enjoyed their jobs. The story line for the room is great fun too (Obviously I wont be giving any spoilers, all I will say is let yourself go and get stuck into it)We managed to beat the room and escape, we won against our friends who were in the other team!The design is fantastic. Cryptic and well thought out. You can even get hints and tips from the crew if you need them.I would highly recommend this to everyone."

We went to ClueQuest for Sophia's 26th birthday and we were not disappointed with the room we chose.Easy to find and a nice welcome. Lovely clean, bright and comfy waiting area and a very good briefing to start by Riley our Misson Control man. Excellent game - really made you think. flowed well and we only need 1 clue in the whole game to get out in time. Quite clever and we will certainly be back to do the other room here. I can see why they are so booked up, very professional all the way through.Clue Quest is certainly well worth a visit especially if you have done a couple of escape rooms before - this was one of the best games we have done and we had a great time.Riley did a debrief before we left, absolutely no rush to get us out and gave us some nice photos and a fridge magnet for our daughter. Friendly team and I would highly recommend ClueQuest - we had a great time and will definitely be back."

One thing that must be said is that ClueQuest has absolutely great customer service; from your arrival you are designated a personal \"hacker\" who explains the rules, makes you feel comfortable, and provides hints and tips whilst you're inside the room. As it can get quite frustrating when you're not sure how to solve a puzzle, it's so wonderful to have someone who will gently nudge you in the right direction without giving too much away, allowing you to still feel like you've accomplished something yourself! The puzzles are all very clever and well made, and require a lot of teamwork and cooperation, as well as imagination! We managed to finish with about 2 minutes to spare, so these games are very well-timed- I can't even imagine the amount of effort that must go into them! In general, you should take part in ClueQuest as 3-4 players, as this makes the puzzles much less harder to solve. I also recommend a minimum age of around 12, although depending on the dexterity of your children, they might very well end up solving the puzzles before you do!As always, great work ClueQuest, can't wait to be back again next year..."

But it set the scene, and allowed everyone to focus on the puzzles, which I suppose was the point.I don't want to ruin it by saying anything more, but honestly, just go. You will not regret it."

The puzzles were really interesting and were quite impressive tech-wise compared to other escape rooms, including the use of computers, cameras and switchboards. In both rooms my team needed just over an hour to complete the missions, but we were allowed the extra time and given prompts to help us escape. It's hard to say which room I preferred, both had exciting elements and well thought out puzzles to complete. I would recommend a team of 4 as ideal. I look forward to trying out the third room once it's ready!"

The reception area was very laid back and relaxing which was nice with a couple of little tester activities (jenga, yes/no game etc.) We then got a nice intro from our guides and we were sent into the room. When in the room we had the perfect amount of clues amd our guide was really good. We did not get out in time, where our other group did but the experience was just as fun. We were then talked through where we went wrong before being moved back to reception for our group photo and we wrote in the guest book. Overall, a great time althouh only downfall was the less realistic idea of having animals as our boss. Prehaps are more mature situation would have set the scene a little better."

We only went in to enquire about prices and when we could book, but they went out their way to get us to do the game on the same day, in about 15-20 minutes! We even had a chat with the manager, who was lovely so customer service alone here is second to none.The second occasion we came, which was at ClueQuest's new premises in King's Cross, I came as a group of five with my parents, sister and fianc\u00e9. Both games were totally different experiences so we didn't feel like we were going in knowing what was going to happen - except for the main rules. We really enjoyed both rooms, couldn't pick a favourite because they both had different styles of challenges. And my 60-year-old dad cannot stop raving about it!The price is worth the experience, and I'm looking forward to ClueQuest opening up more rooms in the future. Thanks team ClueQuest."

All of us had a great deal of fun trying to crack the clues and puzzles. The hour flew by and at the end we felt under pressure to get to open the last door as the seconds ticked away. All six of us throughly enjoyed it, as shown by the almighty cheer when we emerged from the last room. The staff were excellent and friendly. The youngest was very nervous before the start, but decided to give it a go when the nice lady showed him the button which would let him leave at any time. I think this would suit children over about 6, if helped by an adult and could be used as a team building exercise by a company. Definitely book in advance on their web site.There are two puzzle rooms currently, and they are opening a third soon. We will return and do these."

Suitably cryptic clues given when we ere going round in circles and well timed challenges to fill the hour. We escaped with a couple of minutes to go by a trick of luck, really, guessing the last coup,e of numbers quickly, but would probably have got there 'properly' with another 10 mins. Felt we started slowly but got into the pace after 20 mins. Advice would be to make sure your team understands how to communicate - all need to be looking, observing, searching and double checking each other in case some thing has been missed, Essential to keep talking to each other and joining things together. Will return to do the next level, we hope. Deservedly at the top of the list of things to do in London."

A short-ish walk from King Cross station, make sure you print out directions as they really help and write down the number - handy as we were late due to the circle line train delays! Our host was fab, gave great clues that weren't easy. We all thoroughly enjoyed solving all the different things. I'd say under 10's might find it hard or get bored but it's so great for teens and above.

From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were fully immersed in a gripping and exciting storyline with a host who couldn't have been more helpful or interested in our experience (Thanks Doug!)The room we entered (Plan52) was really well set out, with loads of objects and clues to find which, as the game progressed, had a natural flow and sense of achievement attached. As we had a walkie talkie, and there was a microphone in each room, our host could pick up if we were very stuck, and offer subtle hints as to where we needed to go next, which didn't impose on our gameplay or immersion in the story. He certainly didn't tell us how to do it, rather nudged us in the right direction, and all the way through kept in character with the storyline. The rooms had a really good mixture of physical, logical and mathematical problems. Part of the appeal to us is having to find bits and bobs, useful or not, and we enjoyed having a clipboard to log our items and write down anything we thought would be useful for later.We were given 5 minutes extra time to complete the last puzzle, and this meant that we left the room feeling a sense of accomplishment. The storyline kept going until we left the building, and Doug was interested in how we found the game, praised us where appropriate but also had a joke with us when we'd got something quite simple wrong.Altogether this was a brilliant experience, and we are now booked to go and do the second game and we are really looking forward to going back."

They made you feel like you really was about to embark on a secret mission. The rooms were challenging which made it a great opportunity to find out how well you work with your team mates and to find out what each others strengths are and use them to your advantage. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, in fact I have already sent the link for ClueQuest to a number of my colleagues this morning. Looking forward to book my next mission with ClueQuest!!!"

Located 10 minutes walk from St Pancras station it's quite easy to get to. Booked well in advance since it's popular in London at the moment. As their website says, don't arrive very early for your timeslot since there is limited waiting space. Upon arrival we were briefed about our mission and given basic instructions about how the game works...then locked in the room with an hour to escape! The room has many fun and challenging puzzles to solve with each one leading to the next. Some require multiple steps to solve. None of the challenges require physical strength and the game is totally appropriate for children (we have two 13 year olds and a 15 year old). The clues might be a little difficult for younger kids. We managed to escape with just a few seconds to spare. ClueQuest is different and really entertaining...highly recommended!"

It really is sooo much fun, you will get completely into it - I have now been to four - two here and two at hint hunt down next to Euston station. Clue quest is the better quality of the two - bigger rooms, and more rooms to unlock than hint hunt as part of your quest. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was really buzzing when I came out"

A couple of people in our team had done similar things before but it was nowhere near as good as this. They start the whole experience from when you enter and everything is very self explanatory so there was no prior experience necessary. The staff are very polite and fun so i definitely want to try their other escape room if i get the chance. (We did the blacksheep one which was fantastic and I thoroughly recommend it!)"

It was great from beginning, it is a great team building exercise. You have to work together and its not simple as you would think (i cannot give you any information as it will ruin it). Its all about team work and common sense to work your way through. It is an experience i will be booking again, without a doubt. The staff are friendly and make it all a great experience. I went with 4 other friends and it was a team of 5 and it was \u00a321.80 per person which was well worth it. I was told about this via a friend so i though i would book it. My friends were so skeptical and did not really want to go, now they want to book the other mission and telling everyone around them about it. A friend estimated we would complete it in 20 minutes, BOY was he wrong lol It was such a rush and a big high to have completed it with only 1 minute 11 seconds left. We felt great walking out of there. i cannot wait to do it again. You have never felt so smart and so dumb at the same time, it definitely brings out the best and make you notice your mind set."

I had a voucher for a Christmas present and booked at short notice due to everyone's timetable. We could therefore only get a 9.00am or 9.20am slot. It is a short walk from King's Cross.There were 5 of us with ages ranging from 25 to 55. I went with my grown up children and their other halves. It is great for teambuilding or just to see how other people's minds work.Despite the early start our brains soon got into gear and it was good to see everyone working as a team. It is difficult but I am sure once you have done one of these that you would be quicker on the uptake with future ones. They are in the process of making a harder one whilst there is another scenario already on offer. 35% of teams get out of the rooms within the allocated hour.We made it with 10 mins to spare despite a 5 min penalty for getting a code wrong 3 times in a row. Watching the timer counting down certainly adds to the pressure.The staff were all very helpful and welcoming. Despite the fact they were fully booked we did not feel we were being \"processed through\" at all. We all agreed we wanted to do another one in the future.I would also recommend a walk along the Regents Canal towards Camden afterwards. We all enjoyed a hearty brunch."

Went with two teenage daughters (aged 15 and 17) and all agreed that this was one of if not the most enjoyable thing we did during four packed days in London.It was our first ever live escape game and we had no idea what to expect. We were given a really friendly welcome and a fun introduction, with clear instructions but very little given away about the mission at hand. We did the red box room, which was challenging and very enjoyable. We subsequently did another escape room elsewhere in London and this one was by far the more enjoyable experience - it was much more do-able, many of the puzzles could be worked out without assistance but when we were struggling we were given helpful pointers (as opposed to being directly told the answer). Great variety of challenges, puzzles and we all wanted to do another one as soon as we had finished - getting out with a couple of minutes to spare. A great sense of achievement but it would be huge fun whether you succeed in your mission or not, and can't recommend it highly enough - if you are in two minds whether to do it - GO FOR IT! You won't regret it, it's not scary, just fun albeit with a bit of pressure as the clock is ticking down!! Can't wait for the next trip to London when the Blacksheep challenge will be number one on our 'to do' list. Thanks to our two games masters for looking after us so well and making it an amazing experience for myself and my daughters!"

Have done both PLAN 52 and Operation Blacksheep and both are exciting - you feel like you're secret agents! Good dollop of tongue-in-cheek humour thrown in by the makers too.

ClueQuest did the trick!! We both loved it and although we didn't escape in time, we had a blast! Our assistant Johnny was so pleasant and helpful - he really helped to make our experience so enjoyable! As soon as we were done, my husband wanted to try one of the other rooms, and we really wish there was something like this in the U.S. The only negative is they do not have pricing or rooms for 2 people...you have to pay for a 3-person game. Other than that, no complaints and it was a most enjoyable time!"

Went in a group of 5 and played the Professor Black Sheep room.The staff are enthusiastic and friendly, they really try to sell you the story which was fun light-hearted. The room layout and puzzles have really been thought through - they are challenging, varied and also have some humour to them. One moment you are solving puzzles, unlocking chests and the next you are breaking down a door!Even though we were a big group everyone could get involved as the puzzle required teamwork. You also have a walkie-talkie to talk to the staff if you get stuck which is a nice touch. I though this escape room was a lot better than Hint Hunt - tasks were more varied, the room was designed better and the puzzles followed on naturally (Hint Hunt was a lot more down to chance/luck or the staff hints). The group photo at the end & team cards are an added bonus and a little momento you can take home with you. Highly recommend! Will be coming back again to solve Mr Q's Apartment."

We weren't sure what to expect but what we got was an action packed hour.The venue doesn't look terribly appealing from the outside, the street is on is a little run down and the shop front had the shutters down but once you are inside they have some seating areas where you wait as a team for your guide.We were booked for the 9pm slot and it was a little confusing that we were told to arrive at 9.20, as it happened we were running a little late as it look longer than expected to walk from KIngs Cross (I wouldn't use maps on your iphone, it took us a weird way) so we got there at 9.10 and it was all very calm and organised when we arrived. There are toilets on site and they were clean.Our guide explained the game clearly to us, gave us the necessary components to take into the game with us and then lead the way. You are asked not to talk about the game too much so not to ruin it for others so all i'll say is that they have taken a lot of time and effort in designing the game and it shows. It is intricate and very cleverly done. You will be busy for the entire time you are there, you really don't need any specialist skills just a brain. We managed to get out in the time but only with a few minutes to spare.The game itself is 60 minutes but you should allow yourself an extra 30 minutes to an hour for the pre game explanation and the post game debrief.It is probably better for adults and older children, it might be a bit difficult for young children to stay focused for the whole hour."

You have to find clues in the items to crack the codes to the padlocks. Unlocking a padlock provides a clue to another padlock and you keep going until you unlock all padlocks in order to break out of the room. It's fun, something different and you will be on a big high when you leave. I understand there are two different rooms to break out of, although there are a few of the same room so if you had two groups of 4/5 you could go at the same time and see who breaks out first.

It seemed a little scary - with no information really online and all we were told is that we'd be locked in a room!!!!! We still booked. I think that might tell us something about us more than Clue Quest.We were greeted by our special agent of the day, Ben - a northerner (always a good sign) who \"briefed\" us on our mission with equal amounts of fun and tension mixed in. The staff clearly love their jobs here and I must say how much fun Ben brought to it. He was friendly, efficient when we needed his help and just very good at his job - something you don't often see at tourist attractions in London!!We were then locked in a room and had to escape. No idea what to do for the first 3 or 4 minutes but rather than running around screaming (which crossed our minds) we ended up working as a team and, although I'm not going to spoil anything for future secret spies, we managed to succeed in our mission - JUST!!!!With the perfect amount of fun and eduction/mind activity mixed in, Clue Quest was definitely the best thing I've done for fun and I can't wait to get back there to try another mission...and maybe see if Mr Q is single.Cant recommend it enough."

Can't wait to go back for round two! Absolutely never experienced anything quite like it - and not to be missed."

ClueQuest was so clever, completely challenging for the adults, yet equally absorbing for our 10 year old. The staff were brilliant too. It was a huge hit, we were there with another family and all agreed we will definitely return. 40 seconds left!"

The team lead by Zolly, Peter and the crew is very professional indeed, starting from the booking system and ending with the photos you get at the end. Having done both their rooms twice already we decided this time to just get this experience for our staff. Our guide was nice enough to let the two of us into the mission control centre and watch our team solve one clue after another even with sound provided by a second set of headphones. We very much appreciated this as otherwise we would have been quite bored and anxious for an hour, not knowing how our guys are doing. I understand this is not the usual practice, but maybe it could become? It surely would be a way of attracting regular customers. We have done other escape games in London, but always concluded that ClueQuest rooms are the best thought out ones. Their clues are tricky but logical and have a clear path from one to another unlike in some other escape games where once you have solved one clue, it does not move you forward and you always have to come back to the beginning and start again. There is no fun in that as it lacks the excitement you get when you can actually see how you're progressing."

As two 60 somethings, accompanied by our daughter and son-in-law, who bought this experience for us for Christmas, we were somewhat puzzled to arrive at a dowdy looking building adjacent to a building site, ten minutes walk from Liverpool Street Station. We were greeted by the ever smiling and lovely Candice who explained the plot and who would watch over us for the next hour. What followed next was simply brilliant. Taken into a separate part of the building, locked in and told we had to save the world in an hour. A vast array of puzzles and clues to solve, it reminded me somewhat of the Crystal Maze TV programme from a few years ago. We did save the world, albeit with a few helpful pieces of guidance from Candice over the two-way radio, with just a few seconds to spare. We emerged victorious, absolutely buzzing, having loved every second. i cannot imagine that there is anything similar to this that is this good. Do we want to do it again? Too right we do! Brilliant family experience, or for teams of work colleagues or groups of friends. Wow!"

Three of us (guess which three!) had never been to an escape-the-room type experience before. Our task was very clearly explained to us and our mission commander was particularly accommodating and friendly. We won't reveal much about the challenge itself but suffice to say that it was very varied, exciting and just the right level of difficulty. This is a great bonding experience that got everyone involved, regardless of age (and intelligence!).We payed extra for some fridge magnets of our team - but these were very poor quality and we had to wait a while for them so that was disappointing. The place was a little hard to find as well. Neither of these detracted from what was an enjoyable, challenging and unique birthday experience."

My daughter- 17 1/2 was not keen on coming along and moaned a fair bit about going. My 15 year old son was really looking forward to it as he is a logical thinker and saw this as a challenge to be conquered! Once through our briefing and locked in the room my Daughter literally came alive!! no more moaning and you really need the teamwork to make it happen!! Some bits were relatively straightforward and other clues were really hard to get but staff can give subtle clues to help if you get really stuck, by way of a monitor.We conquered the challenge with only 1 minute and 52 seconds left with not too many clues given - hurrah !! So quite a thrilling end and lots of high fives going on! We all had a great time and loved the buzz of getting the next clue worked out!!4 was the perfect ratio of people but 6 is probably too many? Only downside was the dirty ladies toilets & no loo roll/hand towels left and generally very messy on Friday. I pointed it out pre-game and nothing was done as my daughter said there was still no loo roll over an hour later and believe me they were grubby! Hence rating 4 instead of 5.That aside we would all definitely recommend this to do for all and we hope to return one day to try the other challenge that they set. Great concept - well done guys and MR Q !!"

Fun, friendly hosts and they gently guide you through the games. We did the office and really enjoyed the challenges. They are not as complicated as at Hint Hunt and we only needed 2 clues to help us when we got stuck. (At hint hunt we needed constant clues which we felt like we were not doing well! But I think it's just a different way if playing there)So now I have played both Clue Quest and Hint Hunt I would say go to Clue Quest as it's more logical to solve the clues without help. But both still great fun."

We travelled by train and I found the venue easy to find by following the map sent, go via Worship street and you end up pretty much on top of Hearn street. Two of our party were a bit sceptical about participating in the game and were planning on sitting back and watching us other two solve the puzzles, within 30 seconds of being in the room coats were off, sleeves were rolled up and all four of us were well into trying to solve all the clues :) I don`t want to give anything away and spoil future gamers experience, but will say that all four of us had the most fun. You do need to work as a team even if you split into pairs, as time will fly by and there is so much to do. We did escape the room with a very respectable 4.36 minutes left on the clock much to our delighted surprise !!! My two teenage children and (I`m not joining in) husband all said they had the best day and were asking when we could go back to try the second scenario room and were all still smiling when we got home later that night :) Thank you to the creators for a wonderful different concept, a fun day out that doesn`t involve scaring the wits out of us, and to the lovely friendly staff."

It's not their fault add it's due to construction but I wish they'd update their web site with the info. They did mention the construction but their route wasn't up to date and it was another 5 to 10 minute walk to get there, which isn't a problem except you have to be there on time. So plan accordingly. Ok too much time spent on that inconsequential negative. I have given it five stars even after that. The corn ball intro given by our team leader was delivered with complete sincerity that had me chuckling and then pulling for the guy. The quest was fun and definitely worth it. Great for kids and still fun for an old guy."

Once inside we were warmly welcomed, put at ease, and given full explanations of how the Quest works, This was all done in a good humoured but professional manner and the inevitable health and safety/fire escape routine was mentioned, although this is not a physical activity and there is absolutely no risk involved and nothing 'scary' about it.Saying too much would spoil the fun for others, but the challenges are well-designed, properly prepared and implemented, and the support given to players is outstanding. This is something suitable for people of any age although young children under about 10 might have difficulty with some of the concepts. It does not require specific knowledge of anything, although a good command of English would be needed to understand some of the clues.A fun activity and the staff on hand obviously think so too, which makes it even more enjoyable."

After a quick briefing and to be honest the main thing I felt let down by was the story line, which I won't give away but it just did not make any sense! It was just a bit stupid?! If it had been something a bit more realistic with things inside the rooms which actually related to the story line a bit more. It is actually quite difficult which was good, but just felt everything was so random!

All the puzzles were fun but challenging at the same time and we made it out with just under 8 minutes to spare. Would most definitely recommend going and we cannot wait to go back and try the Black Sheep challenge! Was talking about it for days after and telling anyone that would listen about the whole experience."

We escaped with almost 8 minutes to spare and left feeling very pleased with ourselves and thoroughly entertained. It's not the easiest place in the world to find and the toilets were a bit grotty but the staff were great and the puzzles fun and challenging.

We couldn't stop talking about it over lunch and I am very keen to go again with a group of adults. 13/14 year olds are a great age for it.

However, it definitely brings out the competitive spirit in even the hesitant.It's hard to describe the experience without giving away some of the trade secrets, I do think you have to do the first challenge with a very open mind. You need to experience it once and then change strategies after seeing how it works. Our team agreed that coming back for a second attempt would greatly help our chance to be successful.My best advice is to do your homework on the location. It's off a small alley several blocks from the commercial area. Allow at least 20-25 minutes to locate Clue Quest from the Liverpool tube station. We asked for directions at least four times and even once we were on the correct \"alley\" someone couldn't direct us to the actual address a few yards away. It's located in a building with a push button doorbell entry. There aren't many signs or indications that you found the right location so again, allow extra time in case you need it. It was fun, and definitely made us want to do it again."

You won't regret it.Two tips:It is located in the business area of London and so bit away from Oxford Circus etc. and a bit tricky to find. The directions on the website are good. But leave yourself plenty time to get there unlike us who were tearing in at the last minute.The website says 9+ and that is a good guide but if three of the party were 9+ and the rest are younger that could work i would say."

Felt the first challenge was finding the place and was slightly nervous as not entirely sure what to expect but honestly can't recommend this place enough! We accepted Mr Q's mission and had just under an hour of pure fun - dashing here and there, solving his clues to 'escape the room and save the universe' We were a group of two couples and once we stopped overthinking the puzzles, we whizzed through the room. Brilliant fun, something completely different to usual weekend activities and we talked about it for a good while after - will be back for another mission! Over and out - Agent Brain ;)"

It was our second escape room. The site is slightly tricky to find and a bit off the beaten track. Once inside the environment is relaxed, friendly and professional. We were given clear instructions and started our challenge.Without giving anything away, we were all involved in solving the clues and reached a satisfying conclusion - with occasional guidance from our attentive host.It was a fantastic experience and we plan to book another one soon.Highly recommended - if you like to exercise your brain!"

Having taken a while to find ClueQuest as the road is currently under construction, we were slightly skeptical about the activity initially. We were sat down in a room for a while and left by ourselves for roughly 15 minutes, by which point we started assuming we'd made a mistake in booking this attraction. However, after the 15 minutes were up, we were greeted enthusiastically by a member of staff, who was incredibly helpful in answering any questions we had, and seemed to be very enthusiastic about her job. Once we were led inside the room, we had absolutely no idea where to start. But luckily, the employee that had greeted us was available at all times, and sent us a few hints to get us started. Once we'd figured out the general gist of what we were meant to do, we stopped running around like headless chickens and got to work. The scenery is very well done, and the puzzles are ingeniously crafted. If anyone is worried that they won't be able to solve them, don't be! Most of them just require common sense and being vigilant to your surroundings. And if you're ever stuck, the staff member assigned to you will help you out in the form of some cryptic hints. They never give you the answers straight up, which makes you feel like you accomplished something even if you required some sort of aid. All in all, we managed to finish with 9 seconds to spare, which felt incredible. We can't wait to come back to try the next room, which we will most definitely be doing!"

We still had a great time and although we didn't quite finish, they still. took the time to guide us through the remainder of the game. Great concept and very well executed, highly recommended."

We arrived at the nondescript building, only to be greeted by Ben, our host, who ushered us into a quaint little living room set up. We were offered water and lazed into our rocking chairs for our Top Secret briefing. The staff here seem to love their jobs. Genuinely. They're helpful, friendly, interact enthusiastically and appear to be really nice guys. We went for my cousin's 26th birthday and other groups appeared to be everything from families with 10year olds, to couples. The website recommends groups of 3 minimum and I agree that fewer than 3 might have been too hard. The team work comes really naturally once you're in there, and basic life skills appear all you need, but unless you're an innately curious person, this might prove too much, as the room ends up looking as though it's been ransacked by a Jumanji stampede. After an hour of piecing together clues (if you're really stuck, the game master comes to your aid with little hints and cryptic messages) you feel exhausted both mentally and physically. Thank goodness its but a stone's throw from Brick Lane yumminess! I've not had such awesome amusing fun in years. Honestly. The three of us were out of breath at the end and had drunk all of the water we'd taken in with us. Strongly recommend taking a bottle! I guarantee I will be back to do Operation Black Sheep soon. Nice touch: as it was cousin's bday, they gave him a little keepsake pressie. Nothing special, but who gives things away free anymore?"

Afterward, Mr Q's top agent admitted to us that our family ranked at the uppermost level in unwinding our mystery, this was achieved by solving the mystery quickly with the least assistance needed. To that, we simply stated..... \"Elementary my dear Mr.Q\"."

Wishing to be part of a team on the show instead of shouting at a TV screen. And at last here it was the chance to do just that. I wrangled a few girls from work to come along, and although our journey there was a lengthy one due to road closures and a confused bus driver we managed to find the building after a long walk. The building is tucked to one side and a nightclub was in full swing when we turned up for our game at 8pm. We were led into the waiting area, and after a while we were explained what type of things were to happen to us within the hour. Our excitement turned to nerves as we walked to our \"room\" and awaited the clock to start.Not spoiling anything, we started off thinking we would not have a clue what to do, but after the first reveal, everything started rolling at great speed. It was a great way to work as a team outside of work, and pulling together as we did (As well as a lot of frustrated moments) we managed to escape with 5 seconds left, even though we had an incident with the door to leave.It was an amazing hour bring us all together as we defeated the Blacksheep. Will be back for Plan52 and hopefully more game rooms to come.Thank you ClueQuest from the RavenGirls"

I think figuring things out entirely on our own would have been even more rewarding.Overall, my team agreed that this was too expensive for what it was - just a room with locks (one of which was actually broken in our room).

Then escorted to our mission, which we would then have to escape within an hour. I can't explain the mind boggling awesomeness that was to follow. I suggest going in a group of 3 or more, because if you hit a mental wall it's better to have more people to bounce ideas around. We all got fully involved and loved every minute of it. The only minor downside is the mission felt quite short. But that was party due to our mental prowess as we escaped with 14 minutes to spare. The whole experience was ingenious and we'd all happily go again. I will Definitely recommend to family and friends.

But don't worry if you start to struggle with the clues because instead of watching as you stand around frustrated, they offer you a number of helpful hints so that you can progress. The experience is completely geared towards your enjoyment so winning or losing doesn't really matter. Mission complete as far as I'm concerned because we had a whale of a time.A lot of love and care has clearly gone into ClueQuest: from the small touches that personalise the experience, to the framed photos around the reception, including the brothers who started the whole thing. It's a family business that has grown rapidly since moving to Liverpool Street, mainly through Trip Advisor and word of mouth, which further proves its merits as a worthwhile London experience. Believe the hype!I cannot wait to see what they have in store for us next.P.S. The Romanian (not French) lady who hosted the experience for us was lovely which only made us love ClueQuest more!"

I didnt go in with them because I wanted them to think for themselves and not have to take the easy way out and ask for my help. They were just amazing and absolutely loved it. They didnt finish on time but got very close to the end before the host went in to help them. Our host Andrew was absolutely brilliant. From the very outset he connected with the children and made them feel totally at ease! Thank you so much Andrew and Cluequest for a truly memorable experience."

The staff were really good too i thought.The only problem was there was NO airconditioning. It was almost unbearable!!! Just a fan or something would be better than melting in a room for an hour. Also there were a few tenchincal difficulities the second time round but credit where credits due, the staff handled the sitution very well and we completed the challenge :) I would reccomend this to anyone! ...But bring your own fan!"

I'd never heard of ClueQuest but booked some months ago as I could see it was very popular. The place was a little tricky to find and compared to America it has a low budget feel about it but this has to be one of the best activities we have done as a family.

Being in the team that completed OBS I am recommending to anybody who will listen to take part in this newest addition to the set up - there was tangible excitement, ooohinng and ahhing and a genuine sense of accomplishment as each task was overcome, code cracked and clue acquired! It's usually pretty hard to please 18 people on a staff away day, but \"best away day ever\" is the consensus! The staff were friendly and chatty, enthusiatic, organised, patient and helpful.

We had not thought to book in advance and when we got to England we discovered only a single slot was available during our stay. We grabbed it and wow, it was a ton of fun. So my word of advice is once your plane tickets are booked, book this.We managed to complete the puzzle and \"escape\" with a small amount of help from our \"control agent\". He/She monitors you and helps nudge you along if you haven't made appropriate progress in appropriate time. We only needed a few nudges and it all worked out nicely as we finished with perhaps 2 minutes to spare. Everyone in the family contributed to solving the various puzzles and everyone had a good time. I could see this as a fun team building exercise or perhaps team crushing exercise if you fail to solve the problem. We've never seen an activity like this before, and for that novelty alone its worth it, but I was impressed with the overall quality of the \"game\". We'd have gone back to do their other game as well, but there was no availability.We got there by tube which was easy. It seemed a longer walk to Plough St than the google map indicated, but it was there and we did arrive with plenty of time.I wouldn't bring very young kids, but once they are preteens I think they'll do well enough at helping to solve the puzzles.and searching the room(s).When asked, our kids chose this as the most interesting thing they did/saw in London."

The puzzles require you to think fast and clues are given to help you when needed.Unfortunately, explaining exactly what goes on in there will ruin your fun so you just have to try it to see for yourself!Everyone had a great time and staff was very friendly. The kids are not English speakers but that wasn't a problem when with adults speaking the language.I would go again to their new quest tomorrow if I could. Be sure to book ahead as this activity is sold out weeks ahead (on weekends)"

You can have a team of up to five people which was perfect for us. We found this to be a very unique and fun experience for everyone. The game is set up very well and promotes teamwork and patience. It may seem a bit silly to some people, but if you can put that aside, it is a lot of fun and quite challenging."

The starting speech was a little childish considering we were all over 20 and the game is far too difficult for very young children so it seemed a bit out of place, also the location is in a wierd alley and it wasn't easy to find! Lastly the decor of the escape room was great, but the rest of the place looked a bit cobbled together of random furniture and didn't look all too professional. Beyond these minor shortcomings, it's such a unique activity and a rewarding experience, I would definitely recommend it!

I was initially a bit apprehensive about whether it would be too difficult for them, so my husband went along as a \"team member\" to assist if it got too difficult.Well, it went really well. The kids all LOVED! Afterward at our birthday tea, the kids reported all of the cool puzzles they had to solve, and how they had to work together to solve them. They actually sat at the table congratulating each other on their individual contributions to the team and talked about the strengths of each child.So, if you are living in London and want to do something for your child that is challenging, stimulating and that will teach them to work as a team, this is definitely a must!"

When I first read about ClueQuest on Trip advisor I was intrigued, so I initially wanted to book 2 rooms since we were 8 individuals and wanted to compete against each other, but since the attraction was fully booked , we booked just one room for 5, but still on the day 6 of us went to the attraction. the whole family were skeptical , and did not want to go. But let me tell you \"it was one of the highlights of our trip\". You are locked into a room for one hour with your group in attempt to find clues and your way out. The task is not as easy as it is while playing online (escape the Room) , very challenging, but extremely fun. it did not help that some of us did not speak english very well but still we got alot of encouragement and though we did not make it in time we had loads of fun. once you book , they send you all the details on how to get there and though the place is a bit remote, don't get discouraged, it adds to the mystery to the game. it is fun for friends, family and suitable for all ages. I do recommend it for not only tourist but even as a small team building exercise ."

Perhaps the best thing about Cluequest as an attraction is that anyone (above the age of 15 or so) can enjoy it; there are no difficult references to pop culture and no real physical challenges - just you and your friends'/family's minds sweating it out in a very cool environment. Ill happily recommend this escape game to anyone wanting to try something different whilst staying in London. Very clever stuff!

Everything was so much fun and we all got really into it - even though some of clues were pretty challenging! We walked from Liverpool st to the place which isn't far at all but make sure you don't walk too far as we were looking for a main side street, but its actually down a quiet alleyway! Anyway we were greeted quickly and we were soon told our 'mission'! Shortly after arriving you're thrown quite quickly into the room with a lot of information being told beforehand (plus a padlock lesson) and not really much idea what to expect but everything soon makes sense once you work out the clues! Me and my friends all thought it'd be really easy, but it's actually a lot more challenging than it looks (especially the last part) and we managed to escape with just 35 seconds left on the clock! We were talking about it for ages afterwards and we all said how much fun it was and that it's so different from a normal day out! The staff were really nice and friendly (even storing my suitcase for me) and i'm pretty sure they had a good laugh watching me and my friends being clueless! I don't think we could recommend this place anymore! Afterwards it's easy to see why this is the number 1 attraction in London! Just go!!"

We didn't know much about the concept, apart from the fact that you are locked up in a room and you have an hour to escape. At the beginning we weren't quite sure how to begin but with some luck and kind hints from Mr. Q we started to get an idea what to do. The hour went by really fast and there were times when you actually hoped the time would stop.You can always argue whether this is the \"best thing to do in London\". I mean there are just so many things to do and see and I guess it really depends on what kinds of activities you like in general. However, ClueQuest is something completely different and it is hard to believe that anyone would be completely disappointed in it.Important note to anyone wondering: you don't necessarily have to speak English as your first language. At least we survived well though our English isn't perfect."

Thanks to a few timely 'hints' from the moderator, we were able to make it through. Had one mechanical glitch along the way, but the staff took care of it and added a few minutes to our time. Nice touch. We had a blast! Will try the other room next time we're in London."

The staff were great, we were assisted through the process and even managed to escape! Can't tell you exactly what we did as you have to experience it for yourself.

It was certainly one of the highlights of our vacation. Our children aged 14 and 18 both loved it. I think that those under 9 or 10 would probably not be able to fully participate in this challenge. We found it on trip advisor and had been a bit concerned before booking that we would need to know local history or have some local expertise (we are from the US), but this was clearly not the case. The puzzles are solvable with a general fund of knowledge and the ability to work as a team. It was a little tough to find their location, so be sure to give yourself a few extra minutes. We did this as an evening activity to end our day of sightseeing and it was a terrific."

We'd heard about it from Trip Advisor, as it was and currently (at time of writing) still is the number one thing to do in London, but we knew very little else. Our friend had picked Operation Black Sheep. On arriving, having found the unassuming building where it's all based, you are given a basic briefing by one of the friendly staff and then taken to start your mission. Part of the fun is not knowing what to expect, the staff even ask that you not reveal anything you have seen to others. We all really enjoyed our time completing operation Black Sheep, it was an intense and entertaining hour. We're frequent visitors to central London (most weekends) and we like to try out different things each time, and of all the things we have tried or visited this is definitely near the top of our list. It was so entertaining that on the way home afterwards we booked ourselves in for Plan52 at the end of May. Fingers crossed it will be as much fun as Operation Black Sheep."

Can't really say any more than that without giving it away! We did it with work to build team skills, but would be just as much fun with a group of mates. Can't wait to go back and do another one!"

In essence it's so simple - your team is stuck in a room and has to escape by following clues, mostly to open locks of some description. I won't detail the game itself any more than that (don't want to spoil anything!) but it's a fantastic combination of puzzle solving and teamwork (a la Crystal Maze).The whole set-up impressed as well. Our guides beforehand were great, setting up the premise behind going into the room but not revealing too much about what we would encounter when inside. Then after you get your picture taken and can comment in the guest book, as well as getting a memento to take away. Slickly run from start to finish and in my opinion excellent value.I honestly can't remember an hour passing so quickly and with such fun (and concentration!). That countdown timer quickly gets to zero (we sadly went over the hour to escape!) and it's amazing how you start to panic near the end!Simply cannot recommend highly enough. We did the new room, Operation Blacksheep, and we'll definitely be returning to give the other rooms a try in future trips to London."

In a team that included a Chess Grand Master & a Grand Mother, we were intrigued and beguiled by the fiendishly clever puzzles and distracted by a couple of red herrings. Some so simple, others requiring contemplation,calm and co-operation and others nimble fingers. As the minutes flew past we wondered if we would ever manage to get out. But everyone played their part and we got out with just 5 seconds left thanks to the texting speedy thumbs of our teenage team member.Zoli made sure there was plenty of room our wheel chair team member, who was able to be fully involved and crucially solve a number of the puzzles. From Granny to grandson, all were vital and everyone contributed. The shared feel good factor and high on succeeding together was PERFECT. Zoli was fantastic & as others have mentioned the customer service is 2nd to none. A polished and professional set up.Do not hesitate, you will never spend a better team building hour.We'll be back for Operation BlackSheep. Thank you for a lovely time."

I obviously can't say too much, as I wouldn't want to spoil the experience for anyone else, but if you are looking for an unusual way to spend 90 mins in London then give this a go! The building was a little difficult to locate due to roadworks and a diversion, and a large lorry was right outside, obscuring the entrance - I realise that ClueQuest have only recently relocated to these premesises but I think the signage could be improved to aid people unfamiliar with the area - the only sign we saw was the tiny one on the buzzer to request entrance.

All of us had as much input as the other and there are so many puzzles and clues to work out you will have to work as a team. London has some of ,if not the best sightseeing in the world but if your looking for something a little different and great fun try this,highly recommended."

Our slot was at 10pm on a Saturday evening - it wasn't too late for us as we enjoyed a cocktail before heading there. If you are thinking of going then stop thinking and just book it! It's so clever how they have come up with the game! Well worth the money and the people who work there are SUPER nice and make you feel really welcome (which is really nice as we are paying customers after all). We can't wait to book up for the new rooms which they are designing at the moment."

We were very pleased to get out in a good time, there were a few especially challenging puzzles and the host was great (before and after care with the 'theme' carried through properly was great). Only not giving it 5 as could be more done to differentiate with room 1 at hint hunt (we happened to do that one first but I'm not sure which came before). Really good fun good value and definitely recommend. Tip: shoreditch high st station much closer than Liverpool street. Thanks"

My daughter was apprehensive as we did not know what to expect and she doesn't like small spaces or things that jump out at you. We had a fabulous time, working together to try to solve the clues, starting off all calm but then the adrenalin kicking in as the clock is ticking! We escaped with 3 minutes and 40 seconds to spare! All 5 of us absolutely thoroughly enjoyed ourselves (including my daughter!) and we will definitely be back for Operation Blacksheep! Fantastic - definitely recommend."

He absolutely loved it, and turned out to be his favourite thing from the whole weekend. We did hinthunt earlier on in the day and everyone agreed that this was better. Each puzzle just flowed so well into the others and we loved the way that everything linked together. We ended up escaping with 6 minutes to spare, but it could have so easily gone wrong for us if we'd wasted too much time! The guys were so friendly, laid-back, helpful and even hid presents that we'd got the stag in the room for him to open and discover on his own. We could not ask for anything more, they had a great sense of humour too and made us feel so welcome. We are already trying to sort out a date so we can come back and try the new room when it opens!Just book it, you will not be disappointed, this is probably the best value I've ever had for doing something fun and exciting in London. One thing we were worried about was it going too quickly but it's so well structured and planned that we were always kept so busy and with one eye on the clock. Think they do gift vouchers too so would make a great unique birthday present or gift for someone as there's not much else around like this!"

When I spotted ClueQuest, and indeed rival Hinthunt so high on Tripadvisor, my initial response was 'they must get all their mates to write reviews as part of a marketing ploy'. Call me cynical if you must.However...in pursuit of something different to do to celebrate our son's 21st birthday, we took a gamble and paid \u00a380 for the bizarre prospect of being locked in a room for an hour.An hour and a bit later and my cynicism was gone - truly, it was fantastic fun...the time disappeared so fast, and the minute we got home I wanted to go again.Clearly, much of what goes on behind closed doors must remain a secret or it would spoil the magic (and really it would, so I wont), but suffice to say it's really well done and clearly there has been real investment in making it a good experience.If you like puzzles and always fancied being on a Crystal Maze style quiz...well this will be for you.Which only leave me to really be open about the situation around it.The building itself is tucked away off the main street which Liverpool St Station is on and is simple to find...although you do feel you've strolled into some rather dodgy area as you enter the yard it's on.Still, the welcome was warm and you really felt you were getting special treatment. In fact, the staff were excellent.I had no idea what to expect when we did get inside, but despite not being the brightest of buttons, the puzzles were really well balanced and we all had a great time.We're going back as soon as we can - apparently a new room opens in March 2014, so that will be one we'll make an effort to visit.If in doubt, go for it...honestly, you won't regret it."

He was truly there to ensure we had a great experience which we did. After all the pressure we put on ourselves, we were still in the room as the clock turned 60 mins!!. Gabor gave us a further 5 mins of which we only needed two of them to escape. I guess it is all about the personal achievement and although this may not work for the business, it would be nice to give teams of 3 a little longer than teams of 4 of 5 to escape. We convinced ourselves that with only 3 people, we did well to get out in only 62 mins. It was a fantastic experience and one I would recommend to anyone. You don't need any special skills or knowledge to participate in this, just have fun. I have a 9 year old and a 13 year old that I intend to bring along when the new room is open in March.

Way more interesting than staring at Buckingham Palace or Big Ben.You only have an hour to get out so if the game managers notice you're falling behind, they'll give you a few extra clues to help you out. My only complaint would be that if we were given more time, we wouldn't have needed clues from the game manager to finish in time. But that's an extremely minor complaint given how much fun we had."

In my opinion this age upwards is great whilst younger children will definitely still enjoy it but will need helping along by an adult. An amazing way to spend time as a whole family and well worth the money. Children and adults find it challenging alike since it is puzzle solving rather than knowledge based or physically challenging. The time whizzes by as you are fully occupied. Lovely staff. Can't recommend it enough. We will definitely be back for the new Quest in March."

We didn't make it out in time but still had lots of laughs and really enjoyed the challenge as well as the fun discussion over dinner afterwards. It was well organised and well run.

We went in with the \"well its a day out isn't it\". We couldn't have expected to enjoy it so much. Its all brain teaser stuff, a mix of logic, cryptic and problem solving. Its not easy - we didn't get out in the time though our friends with 2 teenage boys did, but so so much fun. Our 8 year old loved it. interesting how young and old brains work differently, he got some clues that we didn't. Its different, its fun, its really well set out and they help you along if you get stuck. We compared experiences with our friends all the way home. Cant go wrong with this one. Highly recommended.

I could have gone on solving puzzles for another four hours. There were enough puzzles to work on that we could take different areas of the room and then collect the clues as we found them. Some puzzles required teamwork to solve, and others could be done on your own. I think this would be the perfect corporate team-building activity (much better than rope courses and trust falls). This would also be great fun for families with children because the puzzles range in complexity. Our host was also very nice and friendly. We loved the storyline that went along with the puzzles.Oh--we were worried that the rooms might trigger claustrophobia since you get locked in. If that's also a concern of yours, don't worry. The rooms are spacious and well-lit, and you have access to an easy escape if you need it."

There are red herrings too, so not everything you find will actually be part of a puzzle (very annoying when you've been racking your brain to see how it fits in!). The game is well organised, and the organiser(s) friendly and welcoming - you get the sense they enjoyed watching you solving the puzzles as much as you enjoyed soving them. It looks a bit out of the way, but is actually very easy to get to from central London. It'll be interesting to see how often they change the puzzles, and whether that means you can go back more than once - I'd happily do somehting similar again!"

Gabor and Stephanie were so hospitable and made us feel really welcome, set up the event and built the anticipation well. I think we ran around like headless chickens for the first ten minutes but soon got into the zone. We didn't actually make it to the end within our alloted time but there was no point where we were being rushed out to make way for the next group. Instead, Gabor and Stephanie talked us through the clues we missed and allowed us the extra time to finish off Cluequest with their help. We all left buzzing. Give Cluequest a go. You won't be disappointed. We will be back when they open their second Cluequest in the same building."

If you love puzzles and friends who can stayed focused for an hour then this is the place for you.I took part in a group of 5 and the puzzles definitely cover a wide range of areas. Each member of our team brought their own strengths to the table and so we were able to escape the room.The key is to search individually rather than grouping together and most importantly communicate what you've found with you're team and make sure to double check every corner of the room (preferably get a second person to double check).We had an absolutely amazing time. I can't recommend this place enough."

Getting there by public transport is ok - get the tube or train to Tottenham Hale station; go out the station exit where the buses to Stanstead go from; past the bus stops and right onto Watermead Way. Cross the dual carriageway at the lights where you go left along Burdock Road (by the red railings of the Techno Park). Turn right and follow signs for Main Reception. All in all it's a five minute walk.The challenge is just right - there are plenty of clues available if you need them. And it makes for a really engaging, enjoyable experience where you have to work together to escape. The only draw back is that for a few days afterwards you may find yourself checking the underside of tables and looking for hidden numerical sequences in all sorts of places!"

It was really good fun and the host was kind enough to let us finish the game with his help (he let us finish the game ourselves but gave us major clues). We felt bad taking so long since we were the last group. We really recommend it but it would be easier with a group of 4 or more. Don't expect to have the time to ponder over clues for too long! Would definitely go back again when they have more rooms. Excited already!!! Oh and the photograph taken and given to all three of us as a memento was a nice touch. FUN FUN FUN!"

We had a hard time finding them at first. It's located in a large corporate building and their were no signs to show the way, but after asking around, we finally found it. They were quite new and had not gotten the signs put up yet, but it was worth the trouble. They probably have signs now.Very nice people, and the game was amazing! We are a family of 4, and we had such a great time working together to solve the clues to open the doors. I wish we had a place like that in the states...and the next time to go to London, we will definitely do it again!The whole thing is designed to complete in about an hour. They give you clues if you need them via a radio and tv system. It was really cool! Never have we done anything like it. It's a great idea and if you are ever in London, you have to try this out! It's for groups of 3-8 I think. Thanks Clue Quest for a great time! One of the highlights of our trip!!!"

Our team had previously been to HintHunt, another room escape game, and loved it, so when we saw there was a new room escape company, we leapt right on it.We were thrilled to discover it was even better than HintHunt. These games are apparently massive in Hungary, but only just starting here. It's a simple premise - you're locked in a room, you have to solve a load of puzzles to get out. If you've ever watched Now Get Out of That or the Crystal Maze or the Adventure Game and wished you could have a go, you will absolutely love this experience. The first thing you have to do is search thoroughly - clues could be anywhere, and some are very deviously hidden. Then you have to solve the clues to unlock cupboards and boxes - which lead to more clues. The thing I especially love about ClueQuest is that it's designed to be possible to solve without help. At HintHunt, they constantly feed you hints through a monitor, and without those hints you'd have no chance of solving the room. But at ClueQuest, you really get to test your mettle, because they don't give you clues unless you ask for them (or you're very obviously in need of help). We didn't ask for a single clue, and were all the more proud of our success as a result.The puzzles are really creative, the rooms are beautifully put together, and all in all I'd recommend this to absolutely anyone. Don't be put off by the trek to Tottenham Hale, or by the slightly battered business park - ClueQuest itself is an absolute joy. It's a brand new business (hence the out-of-town location - doubtless they'll move somewhere more central once they've been going for a while) and run by some really lovely guys. Gabor's enthusiasm at our success made the experience even more fun, and we had a lovely time after the escape re-living the game puzzles with him!"

Fiendish and ingenious puzzles are everywhere, with codes to be worked out, padlocks to be unlocked and secrets to find. It's definitely a team game, at times we were working things out individually, at others all trying to crack codes as a team. And when we got stuck, there were extra subtle clues to point us in the right direction, courtesy of the games master watching us scurry round the room via CCTV! A scary soundtrack heightens the tension and the countdown clock keeps your heart racing.... we escaped with 9 seconds to spare and tumbled out of the room energised, excited and very very pleased to have worked it out. clueQuest is based near Tottenham Hale and it's a bit of a mission to find it - but in a way, that all adds to the experience."

Although the location isn't as central as HH, taking half an hour on the tube from Paddington, it's close enough to the underground station and has plenty of parking. The CQ team are a massively friendly bunch and we had a whale of a time. Of course, that may have been because we were the first paying customers ever and because we completed it in 51 of the 60 minutes available - consider that our challenge! Definitely worth the trip."

We managed to escape with only 49 seconds to go which made this even more exciting. Professor P was great host, i would recommend this to anyone, great value for money too!

I won't say much about the enigmas inside (to avoid spoilers and also because they are quite complicated to explain here!) but it feels like living one of those old adventure games like Monkey Island. Note that the hour you are given to solve the game goes very quickly, adding even more challenge to the experience. We were only two people and unfortunately we didn't manage to \"escape\", however we got really close and we can say that the experience is feasible and highly enjoiable even for a small team like ours.

Some really awesome puzzles and clues to solve, a lot to do but it never felt overwhelming. A great variety of different types as well, one thing that I found with this room was the sheer amount of Aha!/Eureka! moments that made it such a pleasure to play!So, if you are up for a mystery and an escape room that is a bit different we highly recommend Mystery CubeOnly thing we would say is that clue delivery could be better, either putting in a speaker inside the room as I am slightly hard of hearing it wasn't always possible to exactly hear everything Miss Terry was saying.Anyway, 5 stars all the way!"

The cube itself had a great mix of puzzles and challenges, with some very satisfying mysteries to solve. I think it hit exactly the right level of difficulty. We managed to escape in 42 minutes!What really sets apart Mystery Cube is the de-brief following the cube. There was a really great, personalised break down of how we had done and how we had worked together which was really nice to hear. A personal favourite was the quotes from us in the cube, very funny to know what we were saying in the moment!It was also great value for money. I highly recommend."

Only one of us had tried escape room things before so 3 of us were unsure of what to expect, The 'Professor' was really friendly and funny and explained what it was about and the 'rules'! We did manage to escape and had a good laugh trying! Would definitely recommend this to others. Allow about an hour and a half or so for the visit, an hour for the cube and time for your instructions and photos."

I went to this escape game with my family (4 adults) and we chose this particular game as it was a quick drive from where we are, had great reviews and was much better value than many of the games in central London.The host was great - setting the scene from the moment we entered and was hilarious as well. He chatted us through the game in the right amount of detail and did it in a way that wasn't boring.The game itself was fantastic - really challenging but at the same time all of the puzzles were solveable. We had the ask for some help occasionally when we forgot what codes we used and couldn't get a lock to work. In previous games I have had to ask for help to fully solve clues as I got completely stuck. The fact that we just needed guidance for this game and escaped as the clock hit 60 minutes shows that the game is the right level of challenging.The clue and puzzles themselves were nice and varied and nothing was too repetitive (not always the case with escape games). Lots of thought has gone into this game and you can tell that the creator is passionate.Getting feedback at the end and analysis on our personalities and how we worked as a team was a lovely extra bonus which we all enjoyed.Looking forward to a possible Mystery Cube 2!"

It was confirmed we were indeed in the correct place and were soon invited in the building by very 'odd' person. Still worrying what we had let ourself into the Prof entered and wow it was fantastic, so much fun. This was our first escape room and it was truely amazing!

Fret not, because you'll be greeted by Miss Terry, who will warn you of the dangers ahead! Mystery Cube goes to show that as long as you have logic, a high calibre of puzzles, and an engaging back-story with a great host, you can build a big box, and then turn it into a room escape. Well thought out, and a good variety of codes to break, gave our team of three a good run for our money! Although we did get out after 46 minutes, I think we were 'on form' that day, as we didn't spend time faffing about on any particular clue, so with some hesitation could have easily been locked in! With the recent UK explosion of escape room, this one can hold its own, and is highly recommended."

We'll definitely be on the look out for more of these and would highly recommend this to others experienced with escape cubes or newbies like ourselves."

This was a surprise christmas present from my wife; for myself, my brother and various sons/nephews, i.e. a group of 5 (youngest 11).I hadn't heard of this type of experience before so was very intrigued as to what was involved!On arrival Professor QB was an instant hit, engaging the whole group, funny and friendly.Don't want to give anything away, but we all got fully immersed in solving all the puzzles,which were very cleverly designed, appealing to all ages - I'd been a bit concerned beforehand that our younger team players might find it too challenging and lose interest but couldn't have been more wrong! Not to say the puzzles are easy ( they're not!), but by putting our heads together as a team meant we managed to escape the cube (just!).Everyone was buzzing afterwards and the Prof gave us a debrief to rate our effort and make us even more pleased with ourselves for escaping!Fantastic, very well done, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Mystery Cube for a moment. A great experience out of the ordinary."

The owner/operator clearly loves running it and was a fantastic host - playing the part of a whacky professor with gusto and aplomb. 4 of us gave it a go - 3 with previous escape room experience - but the game would work well with any number (between 2 and 5). Mystery cube is a bit out of the way, but not that far, and is totally worth the walk. Definitely recommend, and thank you Professor!"

The cube itself has been nicely designed and the puzzles are hard enough to be challenging but still fun. We completed the mission with a few minutes to spare, so we were all happy.

However, due to some reckless public transport decisions we found ourselves running 10 minutes late. We were worried we'd lose that 10 minutes from our allotted time but Prof QB told us not to worry about it and he allowed us the extra time. He made us feel at home, introducing us to the story of the Mystery Cube and what the objective of our visit should be, all interspersed with great humour. The actual escape room was exceptional fun. We had done other escape rooms previously that were perhaps a bit more 'linear' in terms of what you had to do to escape ie it was obvious that in order to progress you needed to unlock certain locks in a particular order. However in the Mystery Cube the problem solving was a lot less linear. This made for a more satisfying challenge because you had to work harder to figure out how each aspect of the escape room fits in with other aspects. The challenges of the escape room were also very diverse. We were presented with a wide range of puzzles and problems that ensured we were kept very busy during our allotted time!Our group escaped (just) and Prof QB, who had been observing us the whole time, gave us a detailed breakdown of how well we did throughout and we had a nice chat about the experience. Certainly one of the best parts of the experience was the warmth and kindness (and humour) of Prof QB, all the way from start to finish. He made us feel very at home.I would thoroughly recommend Mystery Cube to escape room veterans and escape room virgins alike. A very fun activity indeed! I have already eagerly mentioned this to friends and family, and will continue to recommend - well worth it!"

We did it in a group of four, which fit easily into the cuuuube.Easiest way to sum it up is to list it all in points1. StaffProfessor was lovely and funny but also had a good briefing. Clues offered when asked were helpful and guiding but didn't reveal too much, so you still had to think them through!2. AtmosphereThe mystery cube has many secrets and the overall mystery cube effect was great. Very mysterious.3. Variety and number of puzzlesWe've done at least 5+ puzzles in various countries (lisbon, portugal, london) and this was unique in that you solve the puzzles at your own pace, but you can almost set your own direction, but puzzles are linked to other puzzles. With a whole mix of puzzles, from creative to instructional to 'oh duh that was really obvious if you think about it', it's great for a variety of ages.4. TeamworkGreat for teamwork but also individual work, sometimes you worked on stuff together and sometimes you could figure something out yourself, which was nice in our group of 4 since everyone got stuck in.5.Fun.It's fun! and funny! And there are little surprises that come up that make you smile, made it feel way more personal and welcoming.It was so great that I booked less than 2 hours later after completing our mission, this mysterycube quest for my family members for Christmas. I'm so excited for them to try this."

The cube itself is so well designed with some really good puzzles to solve. It was well balanced in terms of its level of difficulty too - it certainly challenged us but without being so difficult that it took the fun out of it. It's location on an industrial estate adds to the intrigue and it's really accessible on public transport - we took the tube and walked in just ten mins or so.

I liaised directly with the Prof, and because only one Mystery Cube has landed to date, he came up with an itinerary which allowed both missions to be completed with the smallest time lag between sessions.None of us had ever done one of these challenges before \u2013 and some members of our group didn\u2019t even know these types of challenges existed \u2013 however, no previous experience is necessary.An excellent group and team building activity.

Experienced room escapists won't be bored, though -- the sheer variety of puzzles, both in terms of form and difficulty, ensure that you'll always have something to be working on.It's also just really good fun, with lots of devious (but never unfair) bits and some sweet surprises. Professor QB was an excellent host, ensuring that the mission didn't get bogged down but never hurrying us. You can ask for help if you feel stuck, and you can also decide whether or not to accept any offered hints; I greatly appreciated having such a choice, even if we did end up accepting the hints in the end...Some other escape rooms have a bit of a mass-produced feel to them. In contrast, the Mystery Cube is clearly its own creature. Well worth the exploration!(The Mystery Cube's landing site inside an office building means it can't be easily spotted from outside, which initially baffled us. But just check the intercom list once you get to 19 Deer Park Road and you'll spot it.)"

Being immersed in a very special universe, entrapped in space and time, hunting for clues, is like no other game: in this one, you are the actor in the unfolding quest for the exit, which makes this whole experience quite exciting.I thought the clues and enigmas were very clever and well thought out. I liked how apparently random things gradually came together. The organisers must have had a lot of fun building it all. I particularly enjoyed the rewarding lightbulb moments when you connect clues together and unleash another one that you know will get you closer to exit.There is so much going on from every corner of the room that everyone is involved and has to communicate with the others. So it is a great team building (or marriage counselling!) activity.My only frustration is that I can\u2019t tell too much about it.

The two of us then were shown into the cube, and the door locked behind us.Unfortunately, the cube heavily affected us and we have both completely forgotten what happened in there, except that the challenges we faced were very nicely and intelligently thought up. Again, unfortunate, but we didn't manage to escape and were transported off to some other worldly dimension, luckily though the professors were able to alter the affects and just about brought us back to reality.Thoroughly recommend, huge amount of fun and a good challenge, for anyone whether an escape room beginner or whether you've done them before (I've done escape rooms before, my partner hadn't) We are a 19year old couple, but would definitely recommend this for any age."

Including Cluequest, Escape Land, Escape Rooms and Escape Hunt (Hint hunt is booked!). My friends and I saw that Mystery Cube was opening and jumped at the chance to try it out for half-price. Our expectations weren't that high. Located outside of central London (Wimbledon) in an office building we really thought it would be a bit unpolished.The area was deserted on the weekend when we arrived. The building old and filled with offices. Although this part of the cube experience indeed appeared unpolished (its not like they could change the building anyway), once you begin the game, it is ANYTHING but unpolished. I want to write more about just how AMAZING this game was but that would ruin the mystery. This exit game is obviously run by dedicated gamers who understand what makes an awesome challenge (difficult enough, yet no weird leaps in logic, randomness or guesswork). I can faithfully say that it is hands down the best exit game in London at the moment. I foresee them being booked up quickly since they only have the 1 room. This is one game not to miss.My friends and I have all been dreaming about the game the last few days. It is the first time that an exit room has stuck with us for so long. The theme, story and puzzles just meshed so well it was truly like being inside a puzzle video game. We wish so much that we could wipe our memories and play this one over and over again."

Puzzles were consistently thought-provoking, with a mix of simple and more complex ones. There were a lot of key and combination locks, which meant that there was a constant feeling of satisfaction that you want from this type of activity. The room itself was pretty small, having been built within your standard office building, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it was a great experience.Highly recommended if you like puzzle rooms 5/5"

Ring 108 on the buzzers next to the door with the giant 'Bourbon' writing next to it. There's no atmosphere on arrival either which is a shame as I've been to excellent places where they set the scene and really get you into the right mind set. The team here were perfectly nice but it felt like a bare bones effort.This continued into the room itself. The room we booked (Perpetuum) was apparently \"glitchy\" so we had to swap on arrival to the museum heist room as we didn't want to do the easier Grandpa room. We were finished within 35 minutes and didn't really get stretched at any point. That in itself wasdisappointing as I'd read good reviews on that room and that's why we selected this location! We felt that compared to others we'd tried, this room was mostly about hunting for things, there was very little in the way of logic puzzles or things to make you think. It was all very much an anticlimax when we realised we'd finished it and that was all there was to do in the room.It might be ok as a first time escape room, or for younger teams who are looking for a hide and seek style challenge but if you're looking for technology, a good scene setting or a grey matter work out then I think other places might be a better bet. (Time run in East London for example is 10 times better and worth the extra few quid)Perhaps the other rooms are better? All in all we felt that \u00a3108 for 30 minutes of average entertainment was an awful lot of money. We almost asked if we could do another room simply to get our money's worth!"

The experience itself was above average, but let down a little by a bit of an ambivalence to faulty or broken elements. They were unable to give me a receipt, and I was told that the person who could was reachable via the email address.It has been 10 days since the event and I have once again emailed Lock'd, to no avail. The lack of professionalism is astonishing - with dozens of other escape games around London, I wouldn't bother going there."

            "review": "Really disappointing. I have played a lot of escape rooms in London, and also a few in Vegas, so I definitely feel qualified to give a fair review of this experience. My friends and I booked to play 2 rooms at the same time, and split the group into 2 sets of 3 - 1 group in Grandpa's Last Will, and us in Perpetuum. We did struggle to find the venue (which seems common based on other reviews), but when we did arrive, the staff seemed friendly and explained the rules and walkie talkies well. A lady named Ella escorted us into our room, and gave us the backstory to the theme etc. Mid explanation, she realised the room had not been reset properly, and looked at an open box on the wall saying \"oh, shoot. He's forgotten to put the key back\". We were then asked to leave the room so she could hide the key again, but obviously we now knew we were looking for a key to open the grey box! Our time eventually started, but we were only given a sand timer for reference (most escape rooms have countdown clocks etc and screens to deliver clues at tactical moments). We were told to just use the walkies to ask how long we had left if we wanted a time check. The escape consists of 2 rooms - the first of which was really good. We solved the puzzles quickly, and made our way into the 2nd room where things became more complicated. We were encouraged to ask for help, which we did, but Ella was the point of contact for 3 rooms being played simultaneously, and it took a long time for her to respond to us each time we called her. Also, although you are on CCTV, no one was watching, as we kept being given hints for parts of the room we hadn't uncovered or solved yet. For example, \"oh, you need to look at the mug. Oh, you haven't found the mug yet. Ummmmmm, what bit of the room are you at again?\" There was also a part which involved positioning something into a very specific location (won't give it away) but the sensor was way off, meaning that the location was actually away from where the clue had lead us. After calling her several times, Ella explained that we needed to \"just move it around until it works, it's not the exact location anymore\". We wasted so much time on this, and waiting for her to respond to us. At one point, she actually answered our increasingly frustrated calls with \"sorry guys, but I've been busy with the other teams, there's 3 of you all needing help at once\". Mid way through the second room, we asked for a time check. Again, it took several tries at calling Ella to receive a response, in which we were told \"well, you started at 42 mins past, and it's now 24 mins past\". When you are racing the clock, this really isn't what you want to hear! We asked for another clue, and again, she struggled to help us as she didn't know exactly where we were at in the room (because she wasn't watching us). Eventually, our walkie talkie stopped working altogether, and we were left screaming for help because we knew we only had a few mins of time left to complete the room. Ella eventually heard us, and came into the room apologising for the broken radio and for not having noticed us flapping for help. She then informed us that we'd \"run out of time anyway, and the next group are here, so shall i just finish the room for you so you can see how it would have worked?\" Conceptually, this is a good escape room with some clever touches and hard to solve puzzles. One visual element in particular is excellent. However, I am massively disappointed with the experience. One person managing 3 rooms is a ridiculous ask, and ruined our game. We were left feeling incredibly frustrated, and wishing we'd booked somewhere else. I feel sorry for Ella, as although she was very friendly, she stood no chance of responding to 3 teams effectively. If you want a proper escape room experience, where you are not just left to your own devices, I would highly recommend ClueQuest. They have a large team of people watching and listening to you at all times, and you certainly won't feel abandoned!"

The lady there was super nice and checked in with us to see if we needed clues (we thought we didn't... turns out we were wrong!) She also warned us when we were running out of time! Some of the puzzles were really tricky, but satisfying when we worked them out. There is so much stuff in there though its hard to tell what is a clue and what isn't!

In terms of difficulty, I would put it at average- if you have done several escape rooms in the past, you will probably find this on the easier end, but still some challenging elements, so worth a visit.

The puzzles in the room are average and we experienced several missing clues, which resulted in a less than favorable experience. We were not impressed that you have to receive clues through a basic waklie-talkie device. The top-notch games that we have played have monitors in the room displaying the time left and give clues when needed. Lock'd didn't even have a timer in the room! We had to use our timer on our phone!We also experienced a very inattentive gamemaster while playing. Our walkie-talkie wasn't working properly at first, and the gamemaster should have noticed this had they been properly watching the monitors. We had to exit the room to get the gamemaster's attention, and eventually had to switch out the walkie-talkies. There were also times where we were asking for clues and received no response resulting in lost time.I would search elsewhere for better games as there are many of them in the London area. A great alternative to Lock'd if you are looking for something in this area would be Archimedes Inspiration. Archimedes Inspiration just opened in the same building complex and offers London's first fully-automated escape room. We had a much better experience at this escape room."

The quality of the room and the puzzles is superior to other escape rooms I've experiences, including some nice technology that was really clever. It's not just a case of trying to find a key or a four-digit code, you're actually looking for something physical to deactivate the door.It's not that easy to find the place, and they could certainly do with more outdoor signage. Waiting room could do with a bit more decor, and a drink vending machine would do well - it's thirsty work clue-hunting for an hour.Otherwise this is great and I'm really keen to try another room!"

Where it was left down was in introduction (which was very functionary), the room felt empty and the atmosphere was lacking. Some simple suggestions would be to add a visual countdown of the time on a screen to build suspense, make the room a bit 'fuller' in terms of props and a better build up of the story beforehand (or maybe a smoke machine!).

Whilst you could say this is partly down to our experience at these things, most rooms we've done have kept us in for 35-45mins on average and have been well themed and thought out.When we opened the door at the end, we expected either another room or an extra part to it, only to be told 'that's it'. I think more thought needs to go into the theming and puzzles included."

After speaking with Lock'd they were happy to make an exception and let all 6 go together, instead of the usual 5 person max.Unfortunately after this, I had to cancel the evening due to circumstances and after speaking with Lock'd they were happy to give me a full refund, without much fuss at all.I have to say I was very impressed with their customer service and I will 100% be going back to them at a future date to finally take part in one of their games."

It can be a bit frustrating when you think that you have solved a clue only to find you haven't. You have an hour to escape the room which is not as easy as it might seem as some of the clues can be very cryptic. Try it out you will have great fun and a good laugh, we were talking about it for ages and would love to do it again."

It wasn't lacking due to being too challenging or too easy, it was spot on in that regard. The issue we had was that a key aspect of solving the puzzle was broken. We specifically asked the staff (using the walkie-talkie provided) if this bit was broken and they said no. Five minutes later they radioed us and said that actually it was broken so we had to turn a plug off and on to reset the system and bypass it - kind of ruins the whole experience. The outcome was that we failed on the last task due to being out of time, the time we lost by trying to do something that was impossible due to the broken bit! A decent person would have tacked that time on at the end so we could complete it and at least leave feeling happy, instead we left feeling cheated. Good concept, good tasks, but they really need to make sure the technology is able to withstand the use it gets. So despite it being fun and tricky, I much prefer the games by Handmade Mysteries and Escape the Room where there is more attention to detail and atmosphere."

The clues were clever and it was well thought out but the guy on the walkie-talkie (who was meant to give hints if stuck) ended up telling us exactly where the keys were or what we were looking for.

This was our first \"real\" room puzzle (vs apps like The Room and The Room 2) and the timer made us work hard and fast to solve the clues. Neat and unexpected events in the situation/puzzle made this a great time as a family. Young guys running the event seemed to genuinely care that we had a good time. Has a raw realistic feel - not too gimmicky or franchised into a TV/Disney/Internet state. But also not too \"we're new and cool\" heavy-handed, either. Highly recommended as long as your kids are smart and over 9 or 10.

It looked fascinating but we couldn't really justify a trip overseas to be shut in a room for an hour. We were delighted to find they are springing up in London. If you like interactive theatre like Punchdrunk and Shunt this will certainly appeal. Our only comment on Museum Warehouse is that as first timers and in a group of two we didn't manage to finish - we got 3/4 of the way through and had an enjoyable time. It is worth putting in the effort beforehand to make a slightly larger group."

            "review": "Great escape room venue. Having done most of the escape rooms in London, I can confidently say that Lock'd is one of the best escape room companies in the capital. There are better rooms in London, but they're few and far between.Lock'd have a good setup in the Biscuit Factory near Bermondsey, with a large waiting room and plenty of bathroom facilities. We were hosted by the owners, which is always good - they genuinely care about the experience and any feedback you have.The two games they currently have open are both very good when compared to others in London. On the website they're rated as slightly different difficulty levels, but we found them pretty much the same level - the difference between them was more that the Museum Warehouse is more \"technical\" and Grandpa's Last Will is more visual. With three people we found ourselves going from beginning to end with barely a break, and were all always heavily involved. You could play with five people, but I'd say that three or four is optimal. Both rooms are nicely decorated, the props are good and the puzzles seem robust - no wondering whether you're going to break anything as you \"ransack\" the rooms. The one thing that disappointed me was the lack of a \"wow\" puzzle. I really like to have one puzzle in the room that makes me so impressed that makes me stop in my tracks. That said, there were plenty of good puzzles, so I'm really being picky here.If you're only going to ever play a single escape room in London then I think there are a couple of better choices (Time Run and Clue Quest), but if you've played one already, if Bermondsey is particularly convenient or if you think you might play others in the future, then I think Lock'd's rooms are thoroughly good ones to play."

After looking at a couple places, we decided that Lock'd seemed like a good fit. It's located down a couple back streets and in the back of a building complex, the rawness of the location even contributing to the experience, so don't be deterred if you can't at first find it. Just follow the instructions provided in the email (which we did not). Lock'd was a great introduction to escape rooms. The challenges were well thought out and had a consistent theme. We had three rooms to get through, which kept it exciting. We never knew what would lie behind the next door. Hints were provided when it looked like we were moving too slowly on a particular clue. The challenges were difficult, but doable. As we soon found out, a large part of the difficulty comes from thoroughly searching every inch of the room. Great staff, unique facility, and fun game. Would absolutely recommend. "

If you haven't done a room escape before, and you love puzzles, logic games and interactive experiences, then I would recommend doing this one as an introduction. You'll have a great time.however, I have been to quite a few of these now and there are definitely better ones in London. I would do those after you've done this one. This was fun, but quite basic. Not basic in difficulty level, (that was quite good), but in production value / design / storyline immersion. If you have been to some of the other more extravagant ones, you'll spot where these guys could make some big improvements.There was a lot of padlock and keys, and not too many other types of imaginative puzzles, and there was no timer on the wall to tell you how long you had left, the only room escape ive been to that has been lacking this useful feature.Some of the props in the rooms felt a bit random and not in keeping with any particular theme.The guys who let us in and briefed us were very friendly, but nothing about the pre-game bit felt very slick - I would have preferred it if they had been in character, for a more immersive experience. The only room escape I have been to that has had this nice touch has been Time Run, and more experienced room escapers will undoubtedly prefer somewhere like that. Lock'd is definitely worth going to, and I look forward to trying out their other rooms."

We completed this in 35 minutes, so felt a little cheated out of our 'hour', compared to HH which we finished with 37 seconds left on the clock.We didn't feel the same level of exhilaration as we had experienced when we played HH, and it felt very key based, more different types of puzzles are required.There is no countdown clock on the wall, so you have no idea how long you've been in the room which is a little annoying. You communicate via radio to receive a clue, which again would be better if it was via a screen.I'd say go and make up your own mind, but if you've done a game before, maybe try a more difficult room."

Many escape rooms, Hint Hunt being the notable culprit, set a nigh on impossible puzzle, which can only be solved with countless clues from the staff. This approach leaves you feeling a little cheated, not to mention stupid, and you don't get such a feeling of achievement, because you feel like you've had your hand held for the most part. This is where Lock'd is different. The Lock'd room we tried was the perfect balance of challenging vs intuitive. The puzzle was tough to solve, but we were able to solve it almost all on our own and with seconds to spare! We felt a much greater sense of achievement at the end of it, compared to when we completed Hint Hint. We asked for help a few times, but these moments were always us being a bit stupid, and I suspect many groups could complete the room with no help at all.Alexander at Lock'd was very friendly and welcoming, and we certainly plan to go back and play the other rooms when we get the chance.I would highly recommend this experience to anyone - it is extremely fun and I'm delighted it exists in London. One tip would be to arrive a fair bit before your time because the building is quite hard to find within the industrial park it is in."

Found this room a lot better than HintHunt and we only needed 1 small clue the whole game. Nice surprises and we found the game flowed a lot better than HintHunt. I would say if you hadn't tried an escape game before Grandpa's Last Will is an excellent start and highly recommended. We were a family team of 5 and we all really enjoyed this game and escaped in just 35 minutes. We liked Lock'd so much we are planning to go back and do the 2nd room very soon and we were told a 3rd room is in progress. Excellent fun and very well run"

The puzzles were varied and original but most of all, relevant to the underlying story. The game was well paced and there was excellent use of space.As it is still in its early stages, Alexander asked for our feedback at the end, and I am sure they will be continuously improving different aspects of the game to make it even more refined."

Having never been to an escape room before, nor to this area of London, we were all a bit new and unsure of what to expect, but the man that helped us was very friendly and helpful. It is clear from the rooms that they were designed with care. You will need different types of strategies to unlock secrets, but designers have also taken into account the aesthetics of the rooms, and understand the importance of creating an authentic experience. Some of the design is really admirable. I also quite like the fact that this is a recent start-up, as I like to support new businesses. We were terrible at solving the different puzzles, but enjoyed the first experience so much we also did the other room available. It's perfect for a group of 3 friends.

Of course, going hiking in Peak District and safariing in London Zoo could be options but sometimes it just sounds too exhausting or too normal to interest your picky friends. So if you fancy something original and intellectually dynamic and don't bother to be away from central London too far, AI Escape will be your perfect alternative where provides extraordinary live room escape experience and excellent customer service. The escape room 101 - Leo's Path - can only accommodate up to 6 people. However if you arrive with more than 6 participants, you can split in two teams. While one team is trying to make their way out of the room, the other can enjoy snacks and various entertainment facilities in common room from strawberry and cream flavoured Pim Pom lollipops to a video game console. When the first team finished their game, they can be the controller of their fellows' team. Believe me, there is so much fun to be the controller monitoring your friends\u2019 doing as you can never imagine what people are capable of when they are desperate to get out of a locked room.The highlight of AI Escape, as their name suggests, are their fully automated settings. Solving puzzles is a linear progression here and you can only achieve it by logic reasoning and deducing. Attention to details and teamwork are also crucial. In post-game discussion with my friends, we all agree this room escape could also be a nice place to hold corporate events. Besides the room, AI Escape also owns a superstar dog - Coco. She is so adorable and everyone loves her and I bet Coco is the sufficient reason for you to pay a visit."

I'm really looking forward to going back and playing in their 2nd room which they've almost finished making.Aside from the game itself, the staff are amazingly friendly and helpful. I couldn't stop staring at the huge biceps of the Spanish-Taiwanese staff member and his amazing skill on a segway (yes they have a segway).Overall, great fun suitable for everyone.

Very soon after we were in the room and having a blast! I'll say no more about the escape itself except the fact that it's great fun and challenging.One thing to note is that this room is different from others I've seen in the way that it is fully automated, i.e a linear design where you go from puzzle to puzzle rather than frantically searching around not knowing what to do.All in all an awesome experience and look forward to the new rooms!!"

I didn't really know what to expect but the helpers explained everything clearly beforehand and were there as backup throughout via phone hints if we got really stuck. Their enthusiasm was infectious and got us in the mood for a really fun hour of brain frying challenges. The room was of really impressive quality both in design and gadgetry and had lots of fun props to help or hinder us through our journey to find Leo.

Can't talk too much details otherwise wouldn't be so much fun when you experience it. Well you'd better try yourself. And it's a good time to try with couple of friends.

The riddles in the room as well as the decoration all followed the storyline of \"Leo's Path\", so there were no random riddles. It was also the first fully automated room I had been to, and this was also very interesting to see and a nice change to the other rooms I had done so far. The staff was really friendly, and they went through the room with us after we finished to explain every riddle, and also gave a little insight on what other groups struggled with in comparison to us, or where others were faster while it took us very long. You could see the owners were very dedicated to their game themselves, and they even created a small fun riddle for us to find the way from the tube station to the location of the Escape Room.

Someone thinks I'm an escape room expert due the fact I own the mine in my country but when I played AI (the \"quest for Leo\") I started to play thinking out-of-the-boxIt's a very nice game with a great storyboard and a background music that take the players to be part of the story! Also the \"set design\" is a big part of the game: it's perfect for the story (sorry: no spoilers!)!Talking about the game under a tech view.. I liked the electronic background solutions that are totally invisible to the players and this thing means a great work behind! It's the perfect timing (action-reaction) that gives the impression to the players that they solved a game and if someone has played others escapes knows what I mean (=third person activation... too bad , no magic!)Talking about Mrs and Mr I.... many english (and italian) escape rooms owners should learn from this beautiful couple what the word \"welcome\" means: simply the best!Waiting for your next steps I'm watching you!Luca"

Iv'e played a lot of rooms and this game itself for me was too hard, but I understand they are a new company so they are slowly improving the room. Quite a bit of it I just couldn't get my head around without having to ask for hints so that naturally took away the fun of it. But overall it was still fun and they had interesting puzzles. The room itself is very well designed though and at some points I really did enjoy myself. It's a fully automated room, no keys, no padlocks but I personally prefer a mix of both hands on and electrical. I wish the room had had more puzzles that were easier and funner as oppose to a few hard ones.The people who run this place are the loveliest people ever! They really welcome you and we had a good laugh with them after we did the room. They also let me play on there Segway/Hoverboard and gave me a free awesome Pen *Thumbs up*. They have really made the rooms and reception look really nice and well presented and they seem to put so much passion into what they create. So I hope they will listen to feedback because they have so much potential to become an awesome Escape Room Company as they have only been going a month."

When you first walk in to the room, it becomes apparent that smart technology is central to the entire experience - the music backdrop, lighting, and automated trap compartments all come together so seamlessly that it will both surprise and delight. I went with a group of 4, and there were many moments when we found ourselves deeply amazed at the unfolding events as we progress through the game. I think that the AI elements in itself already made the experience worthwhile. Of course, the storyline and puzzles were all on par and cleverly laid out to really spark your mind and imagination.If you love escape rooms and smart tech, Archimedes Inspiration is definitely not one to be missed!"

The introduction given to us was clear and concise, and also very fun. The lady explained everything in detail to the 'newbies' and really encouraged us to have fun.Once you go inside the room, it's fully automated and the clues are great as they follow a storyline. The theme was great and the puzzles were excellent. I can't give too much away or else I will spoil it all for you.However, I would definitely recommend it. I would bring young children as it is too complex for them.

While it was a bit pricier than some of the others, that's my own fault for choosing to come at peak time, and there was a lot about it I really liked so it was great value for money.Here's a quick list of what I think they got right:- Very welcoming hosts. Although they weren't in character and the pre-game introduction wasn't at all immersive, they were very friendly and explained everything throughly. We also had a nice chat afterwards about other room escapes.- perfect clue system whereby we were in control of when to receive a hint.- in the end we never asked for one because the puzzles were designed so well that we never got so stuck that we couldn't work out how to continue. However it wasn't too easy because we escaped literally as the clock hit 0:00, so in that sense the difficulty level for us was pitched absolutely perfectly. There was an exciting sense of panic in the last 2 minutes, as we stared at the last puzzle trying as a team to work it out. It was very satisfying when we did.- good opportunities for all team members being able to work on multiple things at once.- theming in the room was great - authentically felt like the 1940s. there were lots of nice physical puzzles and some items that felt ingeniously designed, in a home-made kind of way.- my favourite part, which I haven't seen in any other room escape, was a coding system whereby a drawn symbol next to each padlock gives you an idea which puzzle will provide you with the code for it. This is brilliant because it removes the very un-fun need to try a 4 digit solution randomly on each of the dozen padlocks in the room until one of them opens - a frustration I have experienced in several other room escapes. I love when there is a logical path through the game, so that no arbitrary guesswork is needed. They got that aspect of the design very right.I think my only feedback would be to try and keep the rules and introduction at the beginning a bit snappier.Really great night out, the people who run it have done a fantastic job and I look forward to playing your second room when it opens."

We breezed through the first 20 minutes of the hour, and I think a bit of complacency may have set in as we suddenly found ourselves floundering with only 15 minutes left and a substantial amount of the journey remaining. The atmosphere is brilliant as well - the props and sounds really add to the feeling of being trapped in a Prisoner of War camp. Would really recommend as a business team building exercise. There were 7 of us and it really encouraged us to think and work together. I understand they are planning another room, and we will definitely be signing up to do that one.

We were a group of 6 visiting London for the day and needed an activity we could all do together. I'd taken part in an escape game in Newcastle before so looked online for one close to central London. After reading some positive reviews we decided to book Escape Plan. We all found it to be a very enjoyable experience. The thing that separated Escape Plan from the previous escape game was it's commitment to providing a believable period setting. There were lots of interesting puzzles all of which were challenging without being too abstract. I'd definitely recommend this to groups of friends who were looking for a fun hour or so within a reasonable distance of central London."

This is great fun for family groups, double dates, or even meeting other like-minded strangers! Leave time afterward to enjoy your post-escape tales; you will compare notes with your comrades."

Fantastic way to spend time together without modern technology getting in the way. Would definitely recommend it and can't wait to do another one."

Everyone has their own strengths which often don't get recognised by siblings, or parents! we all left with a buzz and something to talk about over dinner, maybe the parents weren't so stupid as the 18 year old assumed and the 11 year old can hold her own with puzzle solving. We chose Escape Plan as reviews suggested it was more of a thinking Escape room, we were not disappointed. The two chaps who run the room are brilliant, and obviously had fun setting up the challenges and puzzles. Best afternoons entertainment we have had in a long time."

I was in a group of 3 x Latvians, 1 Swede and me, an Englishman - yet we still managed to escape with everyone playing their part. Obviously english language helps, but even if you have people who's first language isn't english you can still get through it, as we did. Our time was quite good, yet i still think it could've been better! The location is about 10 minutes from the Elephant & Castle tube station and was pretty easy to find. Definitely worth going, and very reasonably priced especially if you have a group of 5 or so. "

We all agreed that this was a great way to spend an hour and embarrassingly we only just finished in time. It is one of the more difficult escape rooms we have come across, but it was still very doable. The location is a little bit odd and perhaps more could be invested into the props. A couple of things gave accidental clues, because of where they had become worn out in certain places. It sounds a little bit vague, but I don't want to ruin it for any future visitors. Worth a visit."

Used a Stag event to book this as something a little unusual (no one except me had done anything like this before), requiring a bit of brain and giving a competitive edge to get out before time runs out. Once the others got the idea of what they were supposed to do, they were well into it and we escaped with 5mins to go which made for a great sense of achievement and teamwork for the rest of the day.Throughout the session, there were plenty of clues to find and puzzles to solve which kept everyone's energy up, even for a our larger group. Thank you Escape Plan - I look forwards to more rooms in the future."

The briefing was great, made to feel very welcome and given all the info we needed to get going.Inside the experience the puzzles were great, testing out the grey matter and we loved it.

The room is watched with video cameras, and we have walkie-talkie communication in case hints were needed.Our team completed it in 47 minutes 42 seconds (no hints), so just off of the leaderboard. We didn't really find the clues too difficult (and they weren't too easy either), but others clearly do as there were quite a few who didn't escape in time during the week we went.What we all really liked, was the time spent afterwards with the organisers, who gave us feedback about how we did and how others typically do, and we could give feedback to them about how we found it and what the thinking was behind some of our actions.We'll definitely be booking up to other escape games after this experience.

Towards the end we could have done with another brain and pair of eyes but we had a fantastic time. Can't wait for the new room now!!Highly recommended. Go, go, go!"

We visited Escape Plan on Easter Monday and had a really brilliant hour and a half of entertainment.Started with a great brief from the staff who were very friendly and helpful. We have only done one other of these types of experience and I have to say it did not disappoint.We actually manage to escape with something like 47 seconds left. It was so much fun and at the end the staff offered us some feedback on how we each performed which was extremely interesting and very funny.I can't recommend it enough and we were still all talking about it 2 hours later over dinner!"

There were 7 of us ranging in age from 15 - 49, but this particular experience is constructed in such a clever, non linear way, that every single one of us was kept busy throughout the hour. There's a very good mix of tasks, different types, of varying difficulty, so everybody can contribute something. The rooms are beautifully and charmingly styled and this escape experience would make an exceptionally good first choice for anybody hesitant about the idea of being locked in a room. Most of all, it was just really, really, really good fun. Our best escape experience so far."

The attention to detail and thought process of each puzzle was to a very high standard. All was relevant to the back story and it really felt that they'd taken the time to fit things together perfectly to ensure our time there was enjoyed to the max. Super impressed. Lots of laughs. I hope they make another so we can revisit this company again. And I must say after visiting other escape rooms that have a far bigger set up I was truly more impressed with this one. Thanks so much for a great day."

We have done some escape rooms before (four different ones), but we were told the chances of escaping were pretty slim when we were only two people. We got out in about 70 minutes (we originally got 60 minutes, but we got extra time because no one was after us). We had a lot of fun although it irritates me that we should've gotten the last clue faster and maybe gotten out in time. The room had many clues that could be solved in parallel, so the ideal number of participants (if you have a little experience) is three or four people. Two is still a lot of fun, and I think five would be fine. We didn't get a lot of clues, which we were happy about. We asked for clues a couple if times when we needed it. If you're doing an escape room in London, I would highly recommend this one!"

On a side note, i would like to add that there was a technical problem with online booking/paypal, and as a result another team was booked at the same time as us. Brendan was sorting it out and trying to make it possible for both teams to play. I really appreciate the effort he put in to make it happen because otherwise we wouldnt have been able to play at all! We were visiting london for the weekend and it was awesome that we were able to make it. So thank you Brendan!"

What made it for us what that the experience was so tactile. You didn't just figure out a code and then click, click, click the box opens by itself with some clever mechanisms and such, it's all manual, with clever vintage gadgets and such.

There was a wide range of the types of puzzles we had to solve and it was constant, non-stop fun, there was 5 of us and we seemed to split up into two groups and each tried different puzzles.

It was something we had never done before and (although we weren't as fast as we were hoping!) every single one of us thoroughly enjoyed our first 'escape' experience. The thing that made it really great however was Brendan. Knowing it was a birthday surprise for my daughter, he had the novel idea of hiding her presents as a little bonus for her to find at the end, thereby making it just that little bit more bespoke and special - a service I doubt the higher rated venues on here would provide. Escape Plan is great for older kids and adults of all ages and I would thoroughly recommend it. Word of advice tho: some clues can be a little bit on the small side so don't forget your reading glasses! Thanks again for a fantastic time Brendan."

Clues and hints were relevant to the context of this escape room (war captivity and escape), creating an intriguing atmosphere. The problems to be solved were not easy but were logically structured in a meaningful way. The overall decoration was very well in tune with the room's theme. It does not help if the whole team focuses on a single clue and it works faster if two teams work in parallel. Definitely worth the experience !"

I really liked that there was a story theme that tied it together, unlike another puzzle room game I attended in San Francisco. The puzzles were challenging but not too hard. Our group didn't get stuck anywhere (42 minutes is the time to beat) but each puzzle felt like it was an achievement when we got it. I particularly enjoyed the sound effects which faded into the background and gave a sense of immersion."

We were a mixed group with two of us having played other games before and two newbies. We were fully briefed by our guide before being locked in the room. It actually felt pretty authentic, the room was decorated really well and the clues were challenging to find and make sense of, in a good way. We liked the way hints were optional, as some games give these out freely, it meant we were even happier when we escaped! There were a good number of hints and challenges which kept four of us busy on different tasks. This game is definitely worth a visit. As a hint, the venue is down a gated side street and we initially walked straight past! When you reach the cafe stop walking!"

This was the first escape room adventure for all of us. we went as a family of four but it would be suited to mates or colleagues too. it was really well organised, great location, close to station and right next to a great cafe- the electric elephant. Brendan was really welcoming and explained things really well. The rooms and game were of a high quality- good props, sound effects and clever mind teasers. It was pitched at the right level, you would be pushing your boundaries but it was doable, though we got stuck on the codes and had to use the hints. It was really really great fun and the time flew by. I reckon though that not all these games are created equally and that a lot is dependant on the designers and imagination and dedication of those involved. I will be recommending this to friends- the theme was great, the props and puzzles were on point and the hosts were charming and helpful. We will be doing more of these in the future and following this company to see what they host next. Thanks for a great day."

So I decided to hold my son's 11th birthday party here with a couple of his friends and his sister. Boy o boy did they have fun. The venue was a little bit difficult to find (first challenge out of the way). No signage over the door. The puzzles are complex enough to be intriguing without being too difficult for young-ish children. Brendon was a fantastic host. He was very patient with the young explorers (and sometimes with the older ones). There was a little cafe next door where we grabbed some hot chocolate and would recommend Elephantastic for pizza later. All in all, a very enjoyable afternoon out for the family. Certainly has whetted my appetite for escape adventures."

They were fully engaged in the activity for the whole hour and were delighted and disappointed when we escaped.

Our game master was really helpful and friendly, made us feel really welcome and relaxed as we arrived at the location, he was also giving us tips and clues you felt like he was rooting for you to get out, not all game masters are this enthusiastic about their customers. Obviously not going to include any spoilers but this was game, similar to enigma escape was an immersive experience which gives it the edge over other games, there is a story and purpose which makes the game worth playing. Different challenges and tasks in this game that actually require some skill and logic not just an hour searching for keys, and as previously stated we escaped which is always a good thing!"

Your experience is monitored by the organisers to ensure if you are close you don't get too stuck and to give you a nudge or a clue whenever you like. This is arranged with a walkie talkie and you are observed through cameras.Sound effects help give the WWII feeling and everything around you feels totally authentic. Unfortunately this even meant resorting to scrawling on a chalk board for some of the trickier challenges.The organisers themselves were very friendly and accommodating when one of the party joined us late into the briefing. There is a complimentary team photo taken at the end and then you can be pointed in the direction of a drinking hole if desired - the organisers have good knowledge of what the local area has to offer."

Some puzzles can be solved in parallel to speed things along. The ultimate aim being to escape the room.We had spent the morning in the Imperial War Museum (only about 15-20 minutes walk away) so were in the mood for this excellent WW2 themed diversion. We were a team of five and although it seemed a bit hectic at times you definitely need a few bodies to spread the puzzles about and get them solved, if you manage it with only three brains you have done really well! The host (Brendan) was friendly and helpful with a few pointers along the way, and it was paced really well to keep us going until we escaped within the last ten minutes.I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone and will be looking out for the planned follow up next year!"

The attention to detail in the layout of the room was excellent and it seemed such a good idea to have a nostalgic theme rather than high-tech gadgets. After a rather slow start we did speed up and realised towards the end we would need to use some hints or we would never get out in time.

            "review": "Another excellent Room Escape puzzler in London. My friends and I have done quite a few room escape live puzzlers in London now and this is definitely up there amongst the best. The current venue is a beautiful little London courtyard (which Brendan, our very genial host, told us used to be the local workhouse) and once you're inside the escape space the production design is convincing and detailed. The basic premise is that you're POW trying to escape using clues left by a previous prisoner. The puzzles are all 'on topic' and varied, although my one tiny criticism is that are maybe one too many 'lock combination' puzzles. On the other hand there were a few puzzles that I've not seen in any other room escape so there was enough innovation to be interesting for even the hard core puzzler. We barely used any hints but Brendan is on hand at the end of a walkie talkie if you need more help. Overall, this was tricky enough to be fun and challenging without being frustratingly complex. My team and I love these games and we'd highly recommend this one. We'll definitely be back as and when there's a new room ready to play."

I must start this by saying this would not be my usual pick of activity, but I was bowled over.The whole experience is fantastic-it's hard to give details without giving anything away. The premise is that you are prisoners of war who have to work as a team to gather clues to escape within an hour.All the clues and games are incredibly well put together-they are challenging without being impossible-we did get out with minutes to spare! Every member of my group agreed they loved it. I just wish I could do it all again.Even if you think this isn't 'your thing', I urge you to try it, as it will be the most fun you can have in an hour!"

The puzzles were tricky but not impossible, well laid out and fun. It wasn't all about picking locks, there were some interesting and quite impressive props to play around with, but I won't spoil the surprises :) Brendan, who runs it all, is really friendly and made us feel really welcome. He emailed me back immediately when I asked if I could add another player. There were 7 of us, which is a lot, but this particular escape room has a lot of puzzles on-the-go so we were never all concentrating on the same thing.We got out with 1 minute 12 seconds to spare. The tally mark on the board showed how balanced the room was, with approximately half of the people managing to escape.Everyone in my group had a great time and we were talking about it for ages afterwards. Highly recommended!"

Convinced by my younger brother that escape rooms is a good way sto spend som time in a big city, we searched the internet for anyone With a last minute booking avaiable. By chance, EscapePlan had a slot available. Though picking this particular Escape Room by chance, we were not let down.I obviously wont give anything away about the escape itself apart from that it has a WW2-team, and that you are supposed to escape from a prison camp given a diary before being locked into the camp and finding hints during Your search. You can ask for Clues, but the tasks should be doable without them (we needed clues, however, as this was our first time).The escape in itself was great, the tasks difficult (it has a 60% escape rate which is good - if it was too easy, it would be boring). Though none of us are great WW2-fans, I liked the fact that it had a team, and they'd done quite a good job getting hold of different kind of WW2 paraphernalia.The owner of the Place told du they'd soon be expanding With one more WW2-based Escape room, would love to go back for this!So, don your beret, tighten your buckles, step into those armyboots, and do your best to beat The Rakes in the prison Escape."

Slightly tricky to find, but the cafe is just to the left of the gates, we ended up at a different gate due to a taxi driver who didn't have much of \"the knowledge\" lol. We arrived and we're warmly welcomed by Brendan. He left us Bob's journal to browse while he finished setting up the room (we were early). He explained the rules and showed us all we needed to know then led us to the room. Once inside we had an hour of fun, frustration, joy and head scratching! Tremendous fun! Won't give away anything from inside the room, as it would spoil the game, but needless to say everything was spot on! Have played another escape room before but the back story here was far superior and the props and puzzles were spot on! Brendan was tremendous at his role, no hints unless asked to provide them but would point us in right direction if we were almost there but struggling to quite solve the puzzle. We all agree Escape Plan was the superior of the two we have played. Highly recommended by us! We look forward to Brendans next Escape Room next year!"

I read a number of reviews online before selecting this one and was not disappointed!When we arrived we were met by Ben who was very friendly and took the time to explain the whole concept to us before we started. He told us the background story and gave some helpful items to my sons - then we were locked in!The level of puzzles and amount of things to do and investigate was perfect. We were all kept busy investigating and discovering for the whole 60 minutes. Ben was perfect at giving guidance just at the right time so that we all kept on track without getting completely stuck.The whole layout and props were great as well, keeping to the theme of WWII perfectly. We managed to escape just after the 60 minutes (using all our clues of course!).Both boys had such a wonderful time they did not stop talking about it all the way home.For us this was just the perfect start to escape room.I can't wait until they create another room as well, since i would definitely come back.You won't be disappointed!"

Theme is good, with lots of period props and puzzles that fit with the story line. Host was fantastic - fun intro, very friendly and more than happy to chat with us after about the puzzles. Good range of puzzles, there were a fair number of combination locks, but each one had a hint that made it clear which puzzle would open it, which avoided the potential frustration of trying out each code in ten different places. Some fantastic mechanics to the puzzles. They'd kept it low tech, in keeping with the theme, but that didn't mean the puzzle solutions weren't impressive - they'd used great mechanics instead of technology to wow us. Plenty to keep all six of us occupied for over 50 minutes which was surprising. It would definitely be a challenge for two or three people to get through the depth of puzzles in an hour! Clues were on an asking basis, which suited us fine. Officially you get up to three, but in practice, I'm pretty sure you'll get more if you're struggling. A nice touch is that each clue will give you the solution to one puzzle, but they won't just give you the solution straight away, they'll start hinting and the gradually give you more help, but it won't count as a second clue until you want help with a separate puzzle.All six of us thoroughly enjoyed \"the Adventure Begins\". All we're left asking is \"when will the Adventure Continue?\" ."

There was a proper story line which flowed and there were plenty of puzzles which allowed everyone to participant in the escape. The location of where it was also matched to the theme of the game. It is very obvious that a lot of thought was put in to executing this game and Branden was a fantastic host.

This was my first escape experience and it was a very pleasant one - it's not frustratingly difficult and it's not too easy, it strikes a good balance by making you think and suitably rewarding you when you do solve a puzzle. You will be thrown straight into the deep end when you're put into the room and are expected to get yourself out - it is incredibly fun and the realism of the setting, props and sound effects will really immerse you in this experience.Mentioning the sounds; they are actually brilliant! They sound realistic and aid in your enjoyment of the experience and were clearly created professionally and with authenticity in mind. The competitive element is still there and is actually quite motivating - you can see the times of other teams and you'll naturally want to beat their time and prove that you're the better puzzle solver! You won't need to bring anything, you're not allowed to take phones etc inside the experience and at the end you'll have a professional quality photo taken of you and your group which will be uploaded to social media for you to share/download etc. Just make sure you bring your thinking hat.This event will last about an hour or so - it's very dependant on how long it takes you to solve the room, but you'll enjoy every minute and it's relatively cheap considering! This event is for all ages so take whoever you like!"

Set on the first floor of a small unit down a cobbled street, the whole area blends into the tone of the design. It happened to be raining at the time which is exactly the when I recommend you play (obviously if it's not raining go anyway). The atmosphere was incredible, working your way through with the weather lending some depth to the clever and subtle sound design. They have a leader board on display when you arrive which gives you something to aim for heading in. Well put together. Every set piece is well designed, well made and simply great fun to interact with. As with all games of this kind there were some in world limitations, but at no point did they jar with the experience at all. Props to the props master! This is a classic escape the room game with a well worked story threaded into each of the challenges. If I'm honest, it's the story that had me going more than anything else. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is that I believe there are a couple gameplay issues I think need revising.Winning, or escaping (which we did) isn't what's important with Escape Plan. It's an experience and great story. If you intend on going, which you should, bring a full team."

Two of our group had never been to a live escape room before, so had no clue what to expect, while the rest of us had very high expectations for what was about to unfold... From the moment we entered the room we felt like we were launched back to 1945. The aesthetics of the room and audio were second to none and really enhanced the experience for me. There was so much to explore and take in that at one point in the game, I looked up and all of my friends were totally immersed in an activity - clearly we were all determined to escape! Escape Plan Ltd was great for the variety of puzzles incorporated into the plot too. Half of the enjoyment is solving a puzzle and afterwards we all felt that we had contributed something to our escape.I would definitely recommend Escape Plan to anyone who is into problem solving or just looking for an adventure. The look and feel of the game is better than I have experienced at other games and also makes you feel like you've got good value for money. I can't wait for the team to build a second room!P.S. The food at the cafe downstairs is worth a visit too!"

I was lucky enough to be one of the first visitors to Escape Plan and I was amazed at how slick the whole experience was at this early stage in it's life. I've played 3 escape games now and this one is just as good as my previous favourite which is one of the longest running and well known games - this is high praise as I often tell people about how much I loved the other game! The war theme is great and the owners, Brendan and Kerry, have clearly gone to a lot of trouble to create the immersive environment by sourcing amazing props and creating games and puzzles appropriate to the time period they are trying to capture.I would thoroughly recommend this game to both those that are new to escape games and those that have played a few and want a new challenge. It's brilliant!"

We supposed to be a party of 3 but ended up doing this as a couple, which was still ok, I don't think that's the reason we sucked (even though it always helps that others have different points of view). The game was fun and quite innovative, and they did manage to surprise us with some of the elements. Cal was watching and giving feedback the whole time, which was quite different than what we are used to, it definitely helped and we couldn't have done it without him. Nevertheless, getting constant feedback sometimes gets in the way of independent thinking, so we're not sure how we feel about it, we ended up feeling that we really sucked and a lot of this we didn't think of ourselves. Bottom line - it was a great game and we enjoyed it, would definitely recommend this one."

Well planned brain teasing clues with great variety so everyone could contribute . Good props and very atmospheric . Great for young and old and would definitely recommend .

I booked this one because it's one of the very few I could find that allow teams of 6 people. I can understand why many don't as some parts of the game got a little overcrowded for us but it wasn't an issue at all.The game itself follows an interesting story and was very well produced. The puzzles are tricky but from our point of view not too hard. We managed to escape with about 2 minutes to spare! I don't have any other escape room experiences to compare this to but if you're a new player like I was this is a fantastic game to play."

OO ITS LOCKED' but quickly came together to solve the puzzles. we found the TV screen interaction just about right to prod us in the right direction without giving anything away and the props and atmosphere was spot on. As it went on we started getting a real feel of what to be doing and eventually solved a lot of the clues so the final twist caught us (well, my brother in law) by surprise and was a great ending.

I've done over 30 escape rooms in London and I'd rate this in my top two.The story is that weird things have been happening in a film studio and someone has disappeared - and you need to find them. So, you step into a plausible cutting room, set about trying to solve the mystery and the story develops from there.This room isn't a question of solving a sequence of puzzles written on pieces of paper to open locks - it's a varied set of problems that are all in keeping with the theme, and plausible as part of the story. It's got probably the coolest prop I've ever seen in an escape room and a couple of really magical moments.But the thing that really sticks with me is the atmosphere - as the story develops the tension rises and the music and the set combined to raise goosebumps and make me genuinely nervous about what was going on - not for the faint hearted, perhaps, but fabulous for anyone that enjoys immersive theatre and a huge addition to an already good escape room."

A surprise for our 'Bride to Be' on her Hen Weekend..we were searching for something away from the obvious Hen Celebrations, and this was PERFECT! 9 of us, split into two groups (due to room max. capacity), some had been to escape rooms previously, others had never done anything like it before. Two of our girls had done 3 or 4 escape rooms in London before and said this one was the best they'd been to, as it had the extra element of drama, as well as simply (or not so simply) finding clues and trying to escape in time. This experience was a full immersion into an old film set, perfect as many of the bridal party are actors, including the Bride to Be. The staff were so accommodating and amazing throughout booking to the end of the experience. We wanted to make it extra special, so they allowed the Bride's team to sit in with the Games Master and watch the second team, which was HILARIOUS & made us all incredibly competitive! Can't wait to send my husband and his friends to do it. 100% recommended! Go go goooo!"

A group of 6 of us took on the Secret Studio for my friends birthday.Having never done an Escape The Room game before I went in blind (other than knowing we had to escape). The story is brilliant and the set very good. A good number of clues to solve and the 6 of us worked well together to escape with 2 minutes to spare.The added 'shock' elements were very good (even if I did jump out of my skin and caused a chain reaction of screams behind me). The guys who run the game do offer you little hints if you're getting stuck, and as it was all (bar one) our first time these were really appreciated. I'll enter these games next time with a more strategic eye to solve the mysteries presented to us. The ideal number of participants is probably 4, as with 6 you all end up spreading out looking at different things and may get distracted from the main task you are supposed to be following.This was a brilliant way to spend 90 minutes on a Sunday afternoon and highly recomnended to anyway fancying something a little different.

First of all, the overall experience has been the best by far - from the very start where you have to find the venue (secret doorbell to ring and say the secret password) all the way through. The staff were so lovely and enthusiastic, which was highly infectious and really put us at ease and got us in the mood. More so than any other room I've done they seemed genuinely pleased to see us! The room itself is fantastic, if you are a fan of classic cinema, there is a huge amount to appreciate and admire. There are plenty of excellent conundrums to get your mind going, which area a nice mix of using your brain and searching skills. Some really fresh ideas that I haven't seen any other rooms do. Difficulty wise, I would say it was on the easier side of normal, everyone in my group bar me and one other were newbies and we managed to escape, once we found our feet. Throughly recommended. If you haven't done an escape room before, a great way to start and see how much fun they can be! If you've done a few, a great way to see some new ideas! If they ever open a second escape room, will deffo come back for more!"

I want to start of by stating that the customer service was excellent. We had an issue with our original booking and Oscar went out of his way to accommodate us. We arrived in what appeared to be a block of flats, surprised top actually find an escape game hidden below. The greeting started theatrically and this theme continued throughout. After a quick briefing we were in the game, set in an 1979 film studio. I won't go into detail of what was involved as I wouldn't want to spoil any surprises, but I will say that this is very different to any other escape game I have done, with far more going on than it originally appeared. If I had one negative to say it would be that often we found the game quite linear, with one person solving the puzzle and the other team members watching and waiting. Overall however this game was very good and I would highly recommended it."

After an orientation we began the challenge. It was really well themed with a keen attention to detail and cool variety of puzzles, clues, problems to solve and things to discover. As we was really, really keen to beat the game (we were told its around a 50% pass rate, and we wanted to be on the winning side) it got quite intense especially towards the end when time was running out, which for me made it all the more entertaining and special (when we did in fact escape!). Had a great time and hope other outfits are as fun and well run as this one."

It was my first escape game so I didn't really know what to expect, but the whole thing was absolutely fantastic and I really hope they open another room soon because I can't wait to do something like this again! Our games master Josh was brilliant and the game was really clever - you didn't know what you were aiming for or where it was going to end so you had to move quickly and keep your wits about you. Brilliant activity as part of a night out in central London."

The second we spoke the secret message and entered the basement, the experience was mysterious and exciting. We were a group of six teens and this was the perfect option, as cinema trips were becoming bland. Whilst this was more expensive than the cinema, i would pick it over that, anytime. Special thanks to our gamesmaster Tice. He made the experience all the more enjoyable. If you like riddles, if you like puzzles, if you like mystery and if you want the satisfaction of escape, then Secret studio is well worth a visit."

We were really impressed by how well done this was, with a great storyline and setup, all confined in a room. We expected a brainy puzzles thing but nope, it's the real deal, looking for clues and put them together.There's lot of thinking and \"try this, do that, oh no wait, this and this together\" going on, good fun and excitement! We felt quite smug at the end as we managed to escape :)The staff is super friendly and totally in the game. We had an awesome time and kept on \"revisit\" the whole thing over dinner.

This was the first 'escape the room' type activity myself and my uni housemates had done and we couldn't have had a better time.The story aspect of the escape was great and kept us hooked from the beginning, and whilst we often looked at each other with no idea what was going on or what to do next the hints provided gave us gentle nudges in the right direction (and often we'd figured something out before the hints came!) We're all a bit on the jumpy side... So for anyone listening it may have sounded like we'd all gone a bit crazy with the amount of screaming that was going on, but it all adddd to the excitement and suspense this game builds.I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly immersive experience - just make sure you've worked out where the closest pub is for when you're finished as you'll definitely be needing a large glass of wine to calm the nerves!"

Having done a couple of room escape games, it can be difficult to try new things and stand out from the competitors but Secret Studio does it brilliantly. Four of us played the 'difficult' game. There is an 'impossibly difficult' one to play but we didn't know what to expect so played it safe. From the moment you book there is a warm, personal and friendly approach from the staff allowing you to understand the details required prior to arriving. Without giving anything away, as you play the game, you notice the hard work that has gone into it. There are a few jumps and scares along the way which are excellent and go well with the story. There is also great use of TV screens and technology used in the room to make it more than a basic room escape. We got out with 7 or so mins to spare and glad we picked the 'difficult level' as probably would have struggled on the harder level.Thoroughly recommend this as one of the best ones I have done of this type. Definitely book this!"

Team gave a good service. Resolved a small issue after a few emails. However, the venue is quite small, which meant that we had originally got sent away when arrived on time. To a certain degree, the difficulty is slightly frustrating as it feels as though its not completeable without hints. With that being said, I was more than happy to take the small pointers to keep us going. Overall, it was enjoyable.

Friends have done quite a few immersive escape games but this one really stood out for its rich use of different types of media and the variety and depth and tasks and puzzles. The background story was excellent and there are some really good twists, turns and surprises. You know you're onto a good thing when you forget you're playing a game, and this is was very much the case with Secret Studio. I'm coming back again with a different set of friends. Really good value and great location - lots of of eateries and pubs nearby."

After reading all the great reviews I couldn't wait to go and it certainly didn't disappoint.We had a fantastic time from start to finish. As soon as you walk into the room you feel like you've gone back in time and then the fun starts with so many different kinds of puzzles and challenges to find the next clue.We left on such a high and was talking about it for days.

This is definitely one of my favourites and the customer service was excellent as they helped organise for my friends to join us in the escape room as a surprise.For those of you looking for escape room recommendations. My favourites so far in no particular order are:- Secret studio- Mystery cube- Cluequest blacksheep- Time runFor either a small group (3 people only) or beginners I would recommend cluequest but all of these were great with unique story lines and fantastic clues. For larger groups I would recommend mystery cube as there was a lot to do in the room at the same time. If you want to get completely immersed in the story, secret studio or time run are fantastic. I would also recommend enigma escape, cluequest plan 52 and if you don't mind being fed lots and lots of clues, hinthunt."

It was a little hard to find the building but I think that added to the experience of the game.

I was planning some fun experience for a group of 5 on Chinese New Year's outing to London--and we seem to be very fortunate to pick the Secret Studio. Usually room escape games are quite rigid in terms of schedule, but the staff was obviously trying to make it as flexible as possible. Although leaving two hours in advance (normally the train takes 1 hour from Cambridge to London) we were still, very unexpectedly, stuck somewhere in between due to train breakdown and arrived nearly 2 hours late, but the staff was very kind to shift our slot to the afternoon. As for the game experience, it was absolutely fantastic. We were amazed by the level of complexity and logic; and the location is very convenient too (right at the centre of town)."

For my girlfriend's birthday I wanted a personalised experience, and the Secret Studio guys were so enthusiastic about my request. Without revealing anything about the room I was able to give my girlfriend a fantastic surprise which really made her birthday.About the room itself: some rooms, in my experience, seem to try to challenge you by giving really abstract clues in random places that don't really make sense, so you just have to rely on the hints provided and I'm not even just talking about the ones at the bottom of TripAdvisor here. Secret Studio wasn't like that; the clues made logical sense, the puzzles were fun, and the room had one of the best atmospheres I've experienced, as well as a completely original quirk too. A good way to test if a room is any good is if you make it out just in time - if you're really struggling, or you make it out in too much time, there's something wrong - and Secret Studio really fit the bill here; we made it out in just enough time to give us the tension and a great feeling of accomplishment.One other thing of note - this room is really handily located just by Holborn station in Central London. There are other great rooms out there, but you'll often be walking 20 minutes from the station to get to the location.All in all, I would absolutely recommend Secret Studio, both for the room and for the great levels of service these guys provided. Looking forward to seeing what they come up with next!"

Excellent communication of clues at the right times, they can see and hear you, so very slick which really helps to make for a fun game."

            "review": "Excellent family Christmas present. None of my family had done anything like this before, so we weren't sure what to expect. In fact, my Dad wasn't very keen on the whole idea before we arrived. However (!) once we got going, we all LOVED it. There was something for everyone in the room. My parents are in their 50's, I'm in my 30's and by brother is in his 20's. We all work in different ways and handle challenges differently. That's why this was so perfect. Some challenges were mental, some were physical. It tested us all in different (fun) ways. There were some challenges that involved all four of us working together, literally! Don't worry if this doesn't instantly seem \" your thing\", or if you are reluctant about the puzzle element of it. You can select the slightly easier option, or the harder version. The other great thing about this is that your team gets to work on its own in the room. I really liked the fact that we didn't have to play the game with strangers. The small team who run the experience are there to help you, and they are really nice!Completely recommend this experience!(I've had to select an option below for \"what sort of visit was this?\"... I've had to select FAMILY - TEENS... but I think you would need to check the age restrictions, if any.)"

I took my parents and boyfriend. I don't regret it and couldn't be more enthusiastic about the whole experience. It's different from the other 2 games I have experienced in that it's unique and the setting, though similar in essence, has a few very enjoyable twists of its own. I won't say more as I don't want to spoil the surprise so just go and see for yourself. There's only one room (you can either choose between 'difficult' or 'impossibly difficult') and they're in the process of getting a second one (I understand it will be an easy one).

The concept is excellent, and the thought and passion that has gone into this game is obvious - and some of the equipment used within the game is fantastic.The theatrical atmosphere is very well constructed, and some of the puzzles which, when solved to reveal the next step, are undeniably brilliant...almost to the point of having a \"supernatural\" feel.This is one of the newer games in London, but has a more \"traditional\" - or European - feel to it in its creativity. (You never forget your \"first\" - but this was probably the closest to it that we have found.) A team of 4 is about right for this room, it is a lot of fun, and extremely well run throughout, enabling every team to be treated on their own merits. It is slightly more expensive than the others - but there is only one game running per time (that I am aware of), and when you do it - what turns out to be only couple of pounds extra is more than made up for in concept, content and execution.Highly recommended."

FYI there's only one puzzle room, so presumably the only difference between the choices of Difficult and Impossibly Difficult is the number of hints you'll get.The group agreed this was definitely the best puzzle game we'd done to date, primarily as there was a MUCH better story line, coupled with a lot more different elements and environments involved than in the other games we had done. It's hard to explain in more detail without spoiling the game so I'll stop there!If another room opens up, we'll definitely be the first ones signing up as this was pure genius!

Overall it is definitely worth the money as the game master was very good and the game was well-designed.

In the day we run social work services in a London borough so are used to stress and times things can get fraught. Secret Studio offered some total escapism but really justified in the way it brought us together.

You have to work your way through by working out puzzles to solve the mystery. Sometimes some of the puzzles need all of you to work on it at the same time. There is more than one room that you get to experience and solve clues in. Its all very retro. If you ever get stuck with any of the puzzles then Oscar is on hand to help and guide you just ask him a question and you will see his typed up response on a monitor. He also praises members of the team or the whole group if you are doing particularly well. We escaped the room in 57 minutes.

Oscar adds to your experience with the secret password to get into the place and then you head into the world of make believe ,where things do not always seem right.I can not recommend this enough,I have been to hint hunt and found out that this is a more enjoyable experience ,it could be a thing that we completed it.With the time ticking and the puzzles are confusing at times and then bloody obvious when you find out why what is where and why this does that.Parking is hard around this area with permit during the week,but we went at the weekend and found a place in Bedford place.The NCP close by 24 pounds for 4 hours so beware .Lets hope that this venture is a success and that the men hold another event and I am already looking forward to it Well worth well done .The only clue is the hour goes so quick and get all the clues in the right order"

As part of a team of tried and tested room escapers (with several under our belt) I was drawn to Secret Studio by the theme (no spoilers here) and it didn't disappoint. This is one of the newer escape games in the capital but it already works seamlessly and there's enough of a challenge in the puzzles to keep even the most avid of room escapers feeling pushed. There are some lovely little surprises/shocks too which put a fun twist on some of the usual room escape elements, and I particularly liked that at least one of the challenges really means the whole team has to work together. Highly recommended as great fun in a brilliant central location. We'll definitely be keeping an eye out for Secret Studio to come up with new rooms! Thanks Oscar!"

Having read previous reviews from other customers I was quite excited to try Secret Studio, and we had chose this escape game as it was very close to our office. Although this place is still establishing itself, we were very impressed with the game and the story line was great and well thought out. The props used were well fitted with the theme of the game and nothing was done cheaply. However, we did feel that there weren't as many puzzles to solve and things to find as another escape game we've tried, but if there were more we probably wouldn't have escaped on time.Our games master was brilliant and really added to the overall enjoyment of the experience.Myself and my colleagues had a really good time and can't wait for Secret Studio to create a new escape room as we would definitely come back!"

Without giving too much away, there were moments where our hearts were racing and we were apprehensive to proceed!I would definitely recommend this room and will be returning when secret studio have developed their next room!

You have to work as a team to solve the mystery & escape in time -- we made it in 57 minutes.At one point our 18 year old Ellie was a little scared & Oscar was there with words of encouragement so she could get passed that bit & move on with the team.We haven't laughed so much as a family in ages so it was all in all a great day out.Thanks Oscar from team Bants all day !!"

There were things for the individual and things for a group to do. I took some first timers who loved it. Olly, the guy running the session was helpful and enthusiastic. They are doing half price tickets at the moment because they are relatively new kids on the block. Best bit... More technical and mechanical - not just code and key. Lots of very cool surprises.

The puzzles are clever and entertaining, and arranged in such a way that you can solve many of them in your own way. It's open-ended, so you can mostly solve them the way you see fit. It requires a team approach and is a great thing to do with a bunch of friends. The setup and the equipment are very innovative and enjoyable to interact with. Even more importantly- the staff at Secret Studio go well beyond the call of duty to ensure an amazing experience. My girlfriend and I had our appointment inadvertently double-booked. The way they handled the situation went beyond excellent and into the realm of some of the best customer service I've ever received. I cannot recommend Secret Studio highly enough as a way to have some innovative fun."

Our game master Oscar gave us good instructions before the game and helped us along the way when we got stuck. They had some technical problems, but solved it in a creative way with paper notes under the door - we though this a part of the game and it did not detract from the experience. It was a thrill all the way through and a real rush at the end. We all love it, and would love to check other escape games.

These lads are very friendly and deserve to do well with this. Would definitely recommend Secret Studio for something completely different on your trip to London.The craic was mighty!!"

I've escaped 4 rooms in Athens, 1 in Seoul and 3 in London and this one is by far the best one yet - Everything from the build up prior to our arrival (the email with instructions) to the execution of the room. I would HIGHLY recommend this to everyone - Team Ben are still talking about this room 24 hours after doing it! Good bits:- Great customer service - Olly is the best!- Amazing back story- The best execution I've ever experienced- Chilling, goosebump feeling as you complete the room- Room setup/layout- Surprises- Activities to get the clues- Awesome links between the task, story, hints and clues- The water- The toilets- EVERY-GOD-DAMN-THING!Improvements:- Score board of top 10 best escape times each month?- A sequal!Words can't describe how much fun me and my team had! We're still buzzing and can't wait to go back to see these guys again for a new room!"

We managed to get it done within the hour- just about- with a lot of tactful help from a very encouraging Josh! In the great tradition of one of the greatest murder mysteries (The Mousetrap), we can't tell you any more of course..... This is a great way to spend time with people you get along with or want to get along with. We're sorry we can't do it again now we know the plot! Highly recommend this. Team Belfast"

There are 6 of us in total, guys and girls ranging from 22 - 35, so often our ideas of what we want from a team night are quite different!We arrived for the 7pm booking and met Oscar (after saying the secret password to get in). He was lovely and gave us all the information we needed before locking us in the room for what became an hour of roller coaster emotions. Without giving too much away, we were challenged/surprised/scared/frustrated/loads of other things, by what awaited us. The task tests your individual logic, but also hugely tests your ability to work as a team. Everyone had their own moments of glory and came away with their favorite bits. The studio is so well set up and there is a lot more to it than meets the eye initially. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to do something different with a group of friends, colleagues, family (might be a bit risky if you're competitive). We managed to get out in the allocated hour, but it was a very close shave and everyone was frantic at the end. It was so enjoyable and a really unique experience. I'm almost jealous of anyone who hasn't done it yet, because it's so much fun!"

Went with 2 friends and 1 of them had absolutely no idea what we were doing. We were a little early when arriving at Museum Street, so we had a drink in the Camera Caf\u00e9 opposite which kind of added to the theme! Upon arrival at the secret door, my friend was still non the wiser as to what we were doing! When she learnt moments later that she was going to be locked in a room she was both apprehensive and excited! Josh was brilliant and from the moment we were locked in the room, we got to work as a team, which is soooooo important if you want to escape within the 60 minutes. The twists and turns are just fab. So pleased we made it to the very end. We are going to be talking about this for years.......everything was just brilliant and one part of the 'game' was just hilariously funny! Can't say anymore as it would ruin the surprises. If you are unsure which escape game to try first, definitely recommend this one....you won't be disappointed."

I just wanted to outline a couple of other things that I liked: - Location: Perfect, just in front of the Brit Museum - was super easy to find- Time slot: Even though we arrived 5 mins late and were really worried it was fine- Room: super authentic. amazing mix between vintage and modern technology. - Gamemaster: Zo was the coolest dude ever- Price: This was one of the reasons why we chose Secret Studio as opposed to other rooms. All in all, top notch experience. HIGHLY recommended to all. Hope you guys do well and looking forward to new rooms you come up with! Mr D @ Bad Familia"

This didn't change when we arrived. Great location too as tourists from out of London we easily got there with not much hassle. The venue was very mysterious and made me feel like I'm actually in the game. Had a total laugh and an overall amazing experience. Oh, and the price is more than worth it. There has definitely been lots of time and effort put into this. Highly recommend this adventure. Thank you for the amazing time guys :) #Stena"

I've never been a fan of escape games or anything that smacks of 'team building' but Secret Studio completely changed my perspective. It's executed in an intelligent and artful way, by people who obviously love good storytelling. Other similar experiences out there can seem very corporate and naff, but this is different. There is a logistical element to the experience, but you don't have to be great at problem solving as you're given clues to help you along. The storyline blends with the game brilliantly, so you feel like your immersed in a film rather than waiting for the *BOO* moment on a ghost train. The production value is high, so it very much feels like a grown-up experience. Highly recommend it for an unconventional group day out, especially if you're a film fan looking for something more than an evening at your local Odeon. This is better than Crystal Maze, and believe me, I bloody well loved Crystal Maze."

I've done about 7 or 8 now, and all have the good bits and bad bits. I would definitely rate this in the top 3.GOOD BITS:- the customer service was brilliant, the best I've experienced at one of these. Very friendly and chatty guys- really great atmosphere inside the room. It has a bit of a spooky feel, and they have gone to great lengths to create the right ambience, using old retro props, and great use of lighting and technology- some of the puzzles were really fun and original- a great surprise twist near the end- good attention to backstory- great themingAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT (in my opinion):- I loved the idea of the pre-briefing video, which also featured again in-game, but it felt a bit cheesy and not in keeping with the 70s vibe of the rest of it. It wasn't that brilliantly acted either. If I was them I would consider re-shooting that to match the high quality of the other footage used in the game.- as with most of the other room escapes I've been to, some of the solutions to the clues and puzzles felt a bit too random, and without much logic. It often felt like we would never have worked out certain things if we hadn't had on-screen help from Oscar (who was lovely by the way). I think as well as just giving random clues, there should always be some sort of hint as to how they fit together, or some sort of organisation and logic behind it.This is still in the preview stage so I'm sure they will iron out a few of these little wrinkles. But considering the fact it's in preview stage, this was already remarkably polished and very fun. All in all, a great night out, compares very favourably against other room escapes, and very good value for money."

Well, Secret Studio did that in abundance. The fact that they come from a film making rather than puzzling/engineering background really showed, with a beautifully crafted \"set\" that had plenty of atmosphere.Even before you get into the room, they start setting the scene, and once inside it grows and grows. One aspect of how I judge escape rooms is on the number of new puzzle mechanics they have. This more than delivers on that front, with almost no padlocks, and lots of cool ways of solving problems. That said, it wasn't perfect - some of the puzzles seemed unlikely to be solved without hints and the gamesmaster was too keen, too early on to provide hints - we'd been in about five minutes and were still happily searching them room when we got the first one. It seemed to improve as time went on and we got fewer interruptions, with less obvious clues. Note that it was still in preview mode when we went, so they may fix these flaws.If you don't mind needing a few hints along the way or if the story is a key part of escape rooms to you then I'd highly recommend it."

I was kinda nervous since it's pretty new and didn't have a whole lot of reviews (though, the existing ones are excellent) but I was surprised to see how professional it was. First of all, There was a very interesting story behind the game which made it a lot more exciting. Second, the interior design and the tools being used are authentic and super cool, really, there's so much thought put into the small details. Third! the staff is brilliant. The tasks are a bit complicated but the staff helped us a lot. Also, you need to have basic understanding of english to complete the tasks. Since we were a group of three, and two of us kinda struggle with english - they were so kind to give us a bit of extra time so I could translate. I also have to mention the beautiful website (although, at the moment, reservations are available only via phone, and as a tourist that was a bit complicated for me so I hope that changes in the future). All in all - a wonderful experience. The three of us had so much fun - so really, if you're wondering on which escape room you're gonna bankrupt yourself, don't hesitate. :)"

Escape within the hour is the mission, and I had 2 friends to help me. Thank god I did, as this is a game of skill, wit and observation. There's a lot to do, and the attention to detail and props that are in the room are brilliant. Being into my films, there's a lot of joy in seeing the style of old classic movies being mixed with modern technology. It's immersive and the Secret Studio team have created an atmosphere that is full of suspense and keeps ramping in excitement. A few areas we struggled with, but the ever watchful staff kept us on the right track if we were getting distracted. There's a lot to love about Secret Studio, one was our host Danny who's enthusiasm for the game was infectious. Full of tricks and mind games, we loved it, and learned who is a good at taking instructions on our team...apparently not me! Top rating for the newest escape room game on the block."

I've never done anything remotely like this (is there anything remotely like this?) and I loved it. It really is an ingenious, and seemingly unique, idea; like an interactive, mystery-based computer game come to life - only more intriguing, cryptic and atmospheric. One is transported to another time and place, and concerned only with solving the riddle at hand - so it really takes you out of yourself, whilst at the same time being highly sociable fun; everyone gets involved. By turns light-hearted and unnerving, the attention to detail is remarkable - very much like being in a classic whodunit film. We found that the experience should ideally be completed by a trip to the pub afterwards; spending a further hour dissecting the clues over a pint! Highly recommended to anyone in search of something stimulating and different. The location is also perfect for a day out sightseeing in central London."

My wife and I went with two young friends to Secret Studio, on their advice we refrained from investigating what the experience would be about. It was absolutely brilliant, an extraordinary piece of staging, it is difficult to review the day, without giving away too much of the experience, enough to say, it's great, it's fun, intriguing, stimulating and most, most unusual. You must work together and act as a team to progress, and as this became more apparent, the fun level rocketed. The developers have done a superb job, so much care and thought has gone into the Secret Studio experience, and this was born out by how well it worked with such a large age spread, we the end of fifty, they the beginning of twenty. Also the fact that we relived the game and our thoughts about, and parts in it with such mirth and hilarity later over a greatly extended lunch.I do not know of any similar experiences to compare it with in the capital, and that sums it up, it is unique, visit before the rush.

The Somerstown Coffee House is a great location for a pre-puzzle drink but also perfectly fits the murder mystery story - and the food is delicious! We stayed around in the room for about 2 hours afterwards chatting, figuring out where we went wrong in our investigations and just enjoying the atmosphere. There were 4 in our party and I would not want too many more doing the same puzzle. \u00a340 might seem expensive for one person's evening entertainment but considering \u00a315 of that is first food, \u00a325 is great value!We have already been on the website to see which we will be doing next!Thanks for a great evening and see you soon!"

Agent Nathan met us at the venue and maintained character so well throughout it really added to the overall experience!During the organisational process he was great at responding to my queries and dealing with all the various requests. He even recommended nearby places for us to move on to celebrate when we'd successfully solved the mystery!!!Overall a brilliant experience that I'd highly recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles!"

He was really helpful and informative and was quick to get back to all of my queries in the lead up to the event. Even when it was predicted to rain last minute, he offered a number of alternatives in case we needed to stay inside which was very helpful. (Only rained for a couple of minutes in the end so did the whole game outside!). The cafe where the game starts is lovely and the parks where the rest of the games happen is an ideal location. As for the games themselves, I totally did not know what to expect but all I can say is that it was really fantastic and so much fun!!! Everybody in my group had a great time, with one of my friends even saying it's the 'best game he has experienced as an adult'.The way it is put together is witty and challenging but really exciting at the same time. I could not recommend it more highly. There are clues, things to think about under pressure, things to find. All really great fun.Anyone who likes treasure hunts, escape rooms or just a fun game, you will love this!!"

I took a couple of our teams from work on a team bonding exercise and remembered a friend from the running club- Agent November himself- so thought I'd give it a try.We split into 2 teams, both doing the same puzzle but in different bits of London. We all got stuck into the puzzles even though it was a typical, dreary, damp London afternoon (a little bit of rain, overcast and windy). Excellent fun was had all round- the puzzles are demanding, the 'Agent' supervisors are fun and engaging and the whole experience is well organised and thought through.This is a much better idea than the 'escape rooms' as you can run around and shout and chat on the walkie talkies- but of course you're at mercy of the weather.I'll definitely be recommending this (already have in fact) and will hopefully be doing some of the other puzzles in the future."

We got there early and had some lunch (which comes highly recommended!)and then the fun began!Right from the off there were clues and puzzles to solve. Ones that the kids could get heavily involved in but also more difficult ones for the oldies to dig their teeth into. The kids especially enjoyed watching their parents running around a park talking to each other with walkie talkies. The experience lasted about an hour and a half and we loved every second of it.....especially the last 20 where we basked in glory having solved it by the skin of our teeth!!A huge thank you to Agent November who looked after us all very well. Of all the escape games that we've played this is definitely one of the best!"

The game takes place in Euston firstly in a Coffee House and then in a park) Me and my friends played the Major X Plow-Shun challenge. We had to help save the world from a nuclear destruction from Major X Plow-Shiun. We had to find objects and solve clues to crack the code to disarm the nuclear device. You are firstly met by Agent November where you are briefed, given a waiver to sign, create you team name and given a choice of different detective hats to wear throughout your mission and walkie-talkies. No smartphones needed. You are then handed a letter this will then lead you onto seek out hidden objects around the coffee house. Once all the objects are found you are then given a map to a park (no bigger than a football field). This is then where we stayed to solve clues and seek out keys which was hidden everywhere within the park. The puzzles vary from picture puzzles, props etc. to help you solve and crack the code to disarm the device and save the world. Some of the clues given you have to have a collective imagination and think outside the box to solve. If at anytime we got stuck Agent November was there for brief guidance. We just ran out of time within seconds so alas the world was destroyed. I really felt like I was Aneka from Challenge Aneka but a detective version. I highly recommend to anyone that loves mysteries / treasure hunts."

I'd recommend an Agent November mission to people seeking a puzzle-based adventure, anyone who's ever secretly wanted to be a spy (and haven't we all?), as well as escape room enthusiasts looking for something familiar yet different. The experience is a great mix of solving clues, paying attention to your surroundings, espionage (of sorts), and some good old-fashioned intuition -- all while wearing a stylish trilby.Our Major X Plow-Shun mission began with a clandestine rendezvous and some initial indoor clue-following, which was a fun way to start and a good warm-up for beginners. Then it was off to begin the mission in earnest, under the friendly eye of Agent November himself (who later put up with a lot of silliness that went on via walkie-talkie).There's something for everyone to do and the minutes fly by -- our team of four was kept busy, without the tasks ever seeming too tedious. Even an experienced escape room fan should find plenty that's original and fun in this mission; I especially enjoyed some of the 'investigative' work that comes in later.It was great to save London in the end, of course, but it would have been a worthwhile even if we hadn't. Fun, appropriately challenging, yet still suitable for all levels of experience/activity (I will confess to being the person who did the least running around in my group). Sadly, I'm not based in London, but I'm definitely hoping to take on another mission when I'm next in the country!"

What a lovely and entertaining evening that left us chatting about it for days and everyone who saw the pictures were intrigued too. Agent November provides the hats and macs for the real experience and it is very real. We needed a fair bit of help as could not stop giggling all night. Super bonding experience, very well planned and thought out and Nathan is extremely kind and helpful."

As big escape game fans (having done all of Clue Quest and Hint Hunt) we fancied Agent November - specifically Major X-Plow-Shun - as it looked to take the same recipie but add in some outdoor action. Happy to say it's great fun and definitely worth doing. We were lucky in that it stayed clear but Agent November does carry umbrellas if you need them. He also has an original model ipad which is definitely worth its weight in gold. Agent November - highly recommended. And good luck in beating our time - we did it with nine minutes to spare, a new record! "

The Rainbow Syndicate had robbed the pub but left some clues as to their whereabouts and after a quick hunt around the pub we were off on the streets of North London following the clues, solving puzzles and hunting down the robbers against the clock all the time with Agent November keeping a watchful eye over us to prevent us straying too far off course. It's difficult to say much more without giving the game away, but it's a great way to spend an hour or so with a group of friends, using your brains and noticing things in London that otherwise you wouldn't give a second thought to. I'm hoping to go back and play the main Agent November game soon."

This put us off at first but it's actually a brilliant idea as it's a good place to meet, eat, and have a pre or post event drink. There's also an awesome retro arcade in the pub!It's close to a station, a short 5 minutes walk from Clapham Junction.Secondly you're greeted by an excellent, and scary lady called Gabriel who really sets the scene. The room itself is dark, dingy, smokey and so well decorated. The puzzles are tough but fun and solvable, and the chain of solving is well thought out.It even gives you a prize if you're lucky enough to win.I can't recommend this place enough!"

This is great for bonding and team building with your friends. The story was brilliant, set was incredible and it was definitely worth the money! Gabriel (the character who guides you through the clues) was genius! Very helpful but you didn't feel like he was interrupting your game. One little mention is that the room does get pretty hot! This is mainly due to all the brains working so hard on the clues ;) Make sure you dress in light clothing. I would 100% recommend this to everyone. It would be great for friends night out, hen/stag parties, couples and work colleagues."

Lady Chastity's Reserve was not only one of the most reasonably priced, it was a brilliant time. Our host was excellent; he stayed in character very well (I suspect he may be trying to make a go as an actor) and was very funny and friendly. We were admittedly also very fond of him because he knew we were Canadian and didn't mistakenly call us American.)The room itself was immersive, fantastically decorated, just the right amount of creepy, and challenging enough to be fun but not frustrating. All of the puzzles were well laid out and when we asked for hints they were helpful but not a dead giveaway. All in all, I would happily recommend Lady Chastity's Reserve as an excellent time, and I can't commend our host enough. He really made the experience for us."

The host is fantastic in character and helps add to the atmosphere but be warned - it's way too hot in that room and be prepared to not be able to see for an hour. The lighting is bad and puts a lot of strain on the eyes and despite the air conditioning units and fans, it was 5 very excited people crammed into a very tiny room for an hour - the temperature soon creeps up!There are a lot of a rules so make sure you don't break any or you do get yelled at!We weren't able to finish the puzzle and afterwards, despite asking - weren't given any more story or information so we left feeling very unfulfilled. The clues are presented in random orders and in my opinion - are not easy to follow, and I've done a few escape rooms. Puzzle wise - a hour is not enough time but after an hour, you very much need to escape for some oxygen and light...I appreciate the effort having gone into setting this up but believe it still needs some work to make it a memorable experience!"

The Lady Chastity's Reserve escape rooms (there are two - one for up to five people and one for up to six people, with slightly different clues) are located in the Four Thieves pub, which is a good start as it's a really nice pub with good beers. The escape room staff get thoroughly into character and have the outfits to match. The rooms have been put together well to feel like dark, nasty cellars, and the puzzles are about the right level of hardness on average. My only feedback would be that Lady Chastity (i.e. the man doing the scary falsetto)'s voice is a bit more screechy than is necessary to evoke the mood, and the voice-over descriptions go on a bit long when you've got the notebook to consult as well."

The 6 of us had played escape rooms before and this is one of the best in London with very clever puzzles! What did let it down was the bouncers outside the four thieves that were very rude, as we arrived after a meal out we were immediately told in an aggressive manner that \"we had been abusive at another club in Clapham and weren't going to be allowed in\"! Considering we were all sober and we had come from pizza express at just after 9 we couldn't work out if it was part of the experience but it certainly put us off straight away! I let out a smile thinking it was all an act and part of the experience and was rudely told \"by the look on your face you know exactly what I'm talking about\". We were told to get against the wall and had barriers thrust upon us and had to wait outside until we were finally let in after examination of our booking confirmation. At every other escape room we were greeted extremely well in a friendly manner but being accused and ultimately being told to turn away was a shock and did impact our experience. We observed others getting turned away with elaborate excuses so this can't have been a one off! When we finally got into the pub and met Gabriel the experience was flawless though, I guess operating inside a popular venue has its perks and flaws!"

As we arrived at the pub we were told to follow him to the room where the adventure/madness would begin! I can't give too much away about the room or the task but let me just say that this was a brilliant way to spend an hour. I took a group of 20 somethings friends and had a great time! You're given a series of clues you must crack in order to achieve the main objective. Each clue brought along even more spookiness and fun! You must go if you like cracking riddles, clues and having a laugh/the odd shriek of fear in the process :) The only downside: I wish it could have lasted longer- time just flew by!"

There are a plethora of these 'escape' games to choose from, and I carefully researched all the ones in and around the London area, but Lady Chastity's Reserve (not Revenge, as I kept calling it) piqued my interest. The location was ideal for the three of us in our group: just a short walk through Clapham high street from the train station. On arrival at The Four Thieves pub, our group sat down for a scrummy roast dinner and cider while enjoying the live music in the fantastic venue. After that, the game's host, Gabriel, came over to meet us and took us upstairs......We left our bags and coats in a secure location before being shown into the room, where Gabriel - who impressively stayed in character the whole time - explained the game. We were issued with torches, then Gabriel made his exit before the lights in the room dimmed. I won't spoil the fun for those hoping to take part, but if you love puzzles and TV mysteries and have an inquisitive nature - and don't mind the odd double-entendre and spooky noise - you won't be disappointed with this game. As there were only three of us, we were given a couple of hints by Gabriel to help us along, though we did manage to complete the game and rescue the Reserve with a few minutes to spare. Tip: spread out and explore everywhere and investigate everything.Following the game, our group were provided with glasses so we could quaff the delicious Reserve in the pub before leaving. I can't recommend this game highly enough. The staff in the pub were efficient; Gabriel was a great host; and compared with other 'escape' games, this experience is relatively cheap. Thank you for having us!Team Bishop's Finger"

The game was fantastic fun, the enclosed dark room, scenario and host 'Gabriel' all help to create a great atmosphere. The difficultly of the challenges was about right, listen to the hint that Gabriel gives you before you start! We really enjoyed it, argued over who had the right ideas, laughed at ourselves, and felt a sense of achievement at finishing the challenge! This was our first go at an 'escape room game' and this has lead to us wanting to try more. The experience is in a room in the tavern off to the left as you enter via the front, and the pub is well worth staying in afterwards to discuss how you got on. Enjoy!"

I went here with a friend as it is one of the few escape rooms where you can go as a 2 and be paired up with another 2.The game itself was great - really interesting story line and the aim of unlocking the wine rather than escaping was a bit different. The concept is very different to other escape games, the main difference I found is that you all work on solving clues together as you have an order in which to solve them. Usually people can explore the room and solve clues as they go and therefore focus on clues that use their skills.We were paired up with a couple that were quite quiet and didn't seem to want to follow the 'rules' of the room (listening to Lady C for what to actually do). This made the whole game quite challenging and despite the fact that we got the wine in the last few minutes, I think it would have been even more enjoyable had I done it only with people I knew.Overall great concept, good props and theme. Could benefit from a few more tasks so that people get to be a bit more involved if their skills aren't suited to a certain task."

First of all the food and staff were top notch. Secondly, our host Gabriel was brilliantly in character throughout, came and met us at our table and showed us into the room which was wonderfully set up - a perfect combination of spooky and intriguing! He helped us as much as he could (which was lucky, I don't think we would have gotten as far without him) and added real value to the whole experience. The hour we spent in there was full of giggles, puzzlement, cries of 'Gabriel, HELP!' and the odd scream. We absolutely loved it and have been raving about the experience to anyone who will listen. Has to be experienced to be believed!"

It was my first experience of this type and I absolutely relished it. We were five in total and I think four to five people is the right amount. We all had a great time - laughed, screamed, jumped, panicked.The room was very well decorated and put you straight into the mood of the story. It had a pleasant, indeed \"homemade\", atmosphere. The puzzles were moderately challenging, and if I had to point toward a negative aspect, I'd say that sometimes it felt like there was a gap between clues, truncating the flow of the game a bit. I guess maybe that's where your imagination and creativity would come in. Last but not least, Gabriel, our host, was simply brilliant! He was a combination of captivating story-telling, arcaneness and witty humour made all the difference in the game - I could easily watch him perform a whole story-book.Looking forward to their next mystery!"

This wasa a surprise birthday outing for one of my housemates (we'd clubbed together to buy a voucher for the game), and he really didn't know what he was in for until we arrived at the Four Thieves. It was a fantastic hour with avuncular and witty advice, from the always in character Gabriel, spurring us on with indelicate hints to achieve the prize. Luckily we hadn't drunk too much before we entered the game - you do need your wits about you. It was great to do in a group - everybody contributes - our self described dippy hippy member of the group surprised herself by being the main person to solve one of the more difficult clues. And the accountant got scared - jumped six inches in the air at one point. It was a great idea to go for which I take all the credit!"

I've done a lot of escape rooms and this really stands out as something a bit different and special - as an experience it's one of the best.Firstly, the pub it is hosted in (the People's Park Tavern in East London) is excellent - brews its own (good) beer, bags of character and has a huge outdoor space that would be great in summer.The main thing that sets this room apart is the atmosphere it creates - from the host Gabriel (who really plays his character delightfully - some rooms just put you in a room and tell you to get out but he's a big part of this experience), to the story and the constant innuendo, to the dark and mysterious set up of the room itself with some marvellous props and a few surprises within... It all combines to feeling that you're a part of something rather than just in a room solving puzzles.The puzzles themselves are good and fair, they weren't really anything special themselves, but they didn't need to be given everything else!We apparently broke the record by about 7 minutes, which means that we probably got too many hints - we didn't ask for any but whenever we were being slow we were quickly given a bit of a nudge - always very subtly, but it was always enough. Given the time, I think Gabriel could probably have left us stewing a bit more!All-in-all I'd strongly recommend this for any fans of (or newbies to) escape rooms or immersive theatre - it's on the boundary between the two and does a great job of both."

We had a great time spending an hour trying to unshackle Lady Chastity's Reserve and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit different to do on a Saturday night. Although none of us had ever done an \"escape game\" before (note that Lady Chastity's Reserve isn't strictly an \"escape game\" because you aren't really trying to escape), we all got the impression that this one was far more immersive and entertaining than other games that we imagine to be pretty corporate and one-dimensional. This was largely thanks to the well thought-out plotline filled with innuendos and believable twists and turns, the creepy set and a convincing, and hilarious, performance from the host, Gabriel. The tasks themselves catered for all interests, were really engaging and suitably challenging. The one thing we would say, however, is that the game is probably best suited to teams of 3 or 4 (we took part as two teams of 5) because the room is very small and the tasks are very linear, so it was difficult for the whole team to get involved in all of the challenges at once.But all in all, this was one of the best Saturday nights we have all had in a while! Keep up the good work Gabriel!"

It was a lot of fun and perfectly paced, although we nearly didn't make it (1 minute to go!) so maybe it's preferable to try it with 3 people? The People's Park Tavern itself is really lovely, it's got a lot of space, live music, and a second bar upstairs with 50 craft beers. Make sure you check it out! Lady Chastity's Reserve takes place in 2 hidden rooms behind the main bar. Book it now and have fun!"

Being located in a really great pub meant we could have dinner and a drink before hand in the same venue, and then go up to the games room in the pub to continue the fun afterwards. The host didnt break character from the moment we met him and the room was really well decorated, which really added to the experience. The game itself was brilliant - the right level of challenge, not to easy and not too hard either and it was really nice to get a prize at the end. I had been to a similar event a few weeks before, which although was much bigger, didnt match up in terms of atmosphere.The only slight negative was the size of the room - it was really small and got very hot with 5 people in there. Althought this in no way makes me want to give a lower rating - i would definitely recommend this, I would just say wear cool clothing!!"

We were continuously on our toes looking for clues & ways to free the reserve. We went as a group of 5, I'd say 4 would be the ideal number as it's quite a tight squeeze once you are all hunting for clues around the room. Slightly cheaper than some of the more we'll know escape room in central London & would recommend it to anyone new to these types of game.

We didn't really know what to expect as we've not done anything like this before.From the word go, we were really impressed. Gabriel, the host, was a superb individual! A great actor with a wicked sense of humour and genuine kindness. (There was a mix up with one of our bookings, but he sorted this really swiftly without making any kind of fuss (he even stayed in character throughout the conversation!) - he worked through his lunch break in order to ensure that the problem was resolved, which it was. It was very refreshing compared to the usual response you get from people - things like 'there's nothing I can do about that' or 'it's not my problem.' In actual fact, it wasn't Gabriel's problem or error at all, but it wasn't ours either and so he sorted it. Top bloke.)The game itself was brilliant fun. We played in three teams, back to back. I can't say too much or it will spoil the game for other players - but it was very well thought through, very well put together, and very well orchestrated. Props were good quality and riddlesand puzzles were just the right level of difficulty - with the option to get a clues from Gabriel available on three occasions if the teams wanted. Puzzles to solve were varied and inventive. Full of innuendo and very silly humour which we loved, the game exceeded our expectations. At the end, Gabriel revealed our times and crowed one team the champions. But we all won Lady Chastity's fabled aphrodisiac wine, much to our delight!The pub where the the game is located, The Four Thieves in London, is also great. It was perfect for teams to hang out when it wasn't their turn to play. Some ate, and the food was good. Drinks were reasonably priced for London. An eccentric host also ran games of Bingo and other fun stuff during the afternoon for those who wanted to join, with prizes! Upstairs was an old music hall transformed into a games room with a second bar - it had ping pong, giant 90s video games on a projector, pinball, and a giant remote control car track with a commentator - really good fun. Would recommend! I'm only sad that we can't playLady Chastity's Reserve all over again now that we've done it, as we'd know what to do! But we'd all recommend this to anybody who likes a bit of silly humour and is looking for something fun and unusual to do.If I could suggest one improvement, it would be the booking process for a large group. At the moment there is no way to book two or more games at once on the website or over the phone, and this meant we had to pay the booking fee three times in order to secure three slots for our players. It's only a small detail and really in the grand scheme of things didn't matter, but I think larger groups would appreciate the option to pay for all their games in bulk.Overall, a fantastic experience, give it a go, you won't regret it! Special thanks to Gabriel who is a total star!"

Through a small unassuming door in a south west London pub we found Gabriel, a man, perhaps, who told us a tale and led us deeper into his dark and mysterious world. We saw things we cannot unseen, we did things of which we can never speak, and I found out that I'm much less cool in a crisis than I thought I'd be. Thank you, Gabriel. Whatever you are."

Although that was great as we weren't taking ourselves seriously (who would at Lady Chastity's Reserve?!).We needed maybe a minute or two more, so we left gutted! But the whole experience was fantastic, much more plot driven and clear-cut than previous escapology games I've done; it had a real purpose.

Big advantage is Gabriel, the \"usher\" who really gets you in the mood and never steps out of the role throughout the whole attraction. The atmosphere of the room is unique and just a bit scary (funnily scary though). Some of the puzzles are very innovative. As for the downsizes - If you book your visit as a couple or as a team of three you are facing a possibility that some other couple may join you. The room is very small and I can't imagine searching for the clues with two or three people that I don't know. I would also recommend not to exceed the number of three as it is hard to picture how can 5 people functionally cooperate in such a confined space. Otherwise it is extremely enjoyable and, unlike other escape rooms in London, it is affordable."

It most certainly exceeded all our expectations.Gabriel, the host, is incredible and delivers the story of Lady Chastity very well, which allowed our group to become interested in the story as well as working as a way to build some tension and excitement before the games began. He often peeked into the room to keep an eye on us and to give us hints when we needed them, which was useful but it never felt like we were being given too much help.Irritatingly the review from TimeOut did affect the experience for me as it made the show sound as if it were meant to be scary, and so I prepared myself for what may have been a show filled with jump scares. However, the only times I jumped were when the smoke machine in the to went off, and during an instance in which Gabriel entered the room almost silently and appeared behind me suddenly. I screamed, leapt into the air, my arms flailing around, before laughing at how ridiculous I was being. Gabriel clearly wasn't expecting that reaction, and ended up bent over double laughing and had to take a moment to calm down outside, which led to a lot of jokes at my expense afterwards.The room in which the game takes place is not massive, but it doesn't need to be, because what it lacks in size it most certainly makes up in character, and there is always enough room to complete all the puzzles. This was with a team of five: the maximum number of players allowed in the room at once. With any more players in the room it would have been a struggle.The tasks often result in finding a combination, but due to the variety of tasks available this is never an issue. They were challenging, but not so difficult that they couldn't be completed within the allotted hour we were given. Earning the wine at the end of the game felt like an achievement, and tasted all the better because we had earned it.All in all, Lady Chastity's Reserve is a brilliant and reasonably priced game located in a great pub in Battersea. It is welcoming, fun, and entertaining. I have never come across anything quite as quirky as this, and having had such a good time here, if this group create any new games I will be desperate to play them as soon as possible."

I've loved them all, but out of these, the Lady Chastity game stands out as the one with the greatest production value. The props are special made for this game, the music, sound effects, recorded voices, books, tools etc, all custom made for this very game. And it is fun! I was in a stupid mindset when I did the game, and so was everybody else. I don't think the game is THAT hard, but we struggled. We got a fair bit of help from our guide, perhaps too much, because we didn't deserve to win the game (it was a close shave!) but we all felt damn good grabbing that bottle!

I researched for a long time which experience to purchase - as there are a lot of different escape room-type experiences and venues across London - but chose this one based on the fact that it was one of the few places that we could take part as just a two, and it was a little cheaper than the others.I'm so glad we did buy this one as, although I haven't done any others, it seemed very much more immersive and detective like that others on offer. Plus the prospect of winning some red wine and eating a delicious meal in a nice pub was attractive!The pub itself is really lovely, with a 'ginyard' with very tasty gin drinks on offer, and a great selection of food too (the Four Thieves burger was to die for).Gabriel, the host, was absolutely fantastic! He incorporated the perfect amount of fun and playfulness with seriousness in order for us to understand what to do. The room is quite small, so I would actually recommend doing this in a smaller group. I would think any more than 4 would be a squish. The game itself was the perfect level of challenge and fun for us and we completed it with 9 minutes to spare - very proud! The whole thing was great fun! I don't usually like this sort of immersive gaming but I loved every second of it; the mystery, the challenge, the logic needed and the story were awesome.I would recommend it to anyone."

When I look back over the 15 or so \"escape rooms\" I've visited in London, many of the details merge together and it's not always easy to remember which room was which. I doubt that will ever be an issue with Lady Chastity's Reserve! They've gone to a lot of trouble picking their host and designing the room to really immerse people in the game. Let's start at the beginning: The venue is excellent - a lively pub in an area with plenty of nearby restaurants, or if you're feeling lazy, food is served in the bar itself. Once you arrive, you're greeted by Gabriel who is, frankly, amazing. He really sets the scene, but knows how thickly to layer it on - he walked the line of making us feel very slightly uncomfortable without it ever feeling unpleasant. Nervous, without feeling scared.After entering the room there are a number of fun puzzles to solve, with a very clear goal and some good clues to help you along the way if you get stuck. For the more experienced players, you might get a little frustrated by the linearity of the game (although for novices, that's probably a good thing) and by the number of codes/padlocks - most steps resulted in a code or a key, rather than anything cleverer.As for the ending: The game has a very satisfying finish and a sense of completion that probably beats every other escape room I've attended. Oh, and for once they're reasonable about taking photos in the room - don't spoil the game for others, but feel free to take pictures. Not that we had time :-)In summary - OK puzzles, more than made up for by a fantastic host, great venue and great ambiance.(Full disclosure - I won free entry to this in a competition, although it hasn't in any way affected my write up)"

It was the best of fun and we learnt a lot about each other. The room the game is in really sets the mood and it feels like you're in a movie! Such fun. Would recommend to anyone who is bored of the everyday things to do in London."

I went along as part of a company afternoon out and we split into two teams with the challenge of who could solve the mystery first.The whole experience from start to finish was incredible. We had a really fun and theatrical host who was like a gothic bohemian ring master. The room itself was brilliantly designed right down to the finest detail - which made for a really spooky and atmospheric encounter.Others in the group said it was SO much better than any other 'escape room' experiences they had tried and that they wanted to do it again.I could not recommend this more! Perfect for a group of friends who want do do something a bit different or as a great company team building day. It's set in a really cool pub in in Clapham called the Four Thieves so you can all have a drink and a bite to eat afterwards.Do it! It's amazing"

They're usually fun, even the less good ones are more fun than most other options for ways to spend an hour. But it seems unanimously agreed by all experienced players that Time Run is the best. Here's why:- production value. Not just a lot of money has gone into this, but also a lot of love and talent.- the sets are head and shoulders above anything else you'll play in London, probably in the U.K. They aren't just decorated rooms, they are like movie sets, fully immersive, like you're properly inside an adventure game.- even the pre-game bit is amazing. The front door is awesome, the host greets you fully in character, and while he gives you your story and instructions, the immersive experience has already started. This hardly ever happens in room escapes, and this is one of the things that really sets it apart.- all this great stuff could have been really let down if the puzzle design was a bit shoddy. Luckily this isn't the case, they've nailed that too. the puzzles all fit in perfectly with the themed settings, and had a clear logic that was often challenging but the solutions never felt unfair or too random.I regularly review the room escapes I go to on Trip Advisor, and I hardly ever award five stars. This is because Time Run sets the bar for what a five star game is like, and nothing else really comes close."

As soon as you enter the building for the briefing, your host is in character which really adds to the excitement. The whole experience is theatrical and entertaining.Although you're on your feet for the whole time, there's nothing too physically demanding so no great fitness level required or particular dress code.We didn't actually escape in time, although I think we were close, but nevertheless we really had a lot of fun trying!

The story and actors are good campy fun, pulling you straight into the time traveling scenario and world from the moment the doors open, and the puzzles are a nice blend of problem-solving and cooperation so that everyone has something to do. There were a couple times when the props were harder to manipulate that they needed to be, but it wasn't a big enough issue to warrant marking this down a notch.Overall a great way to spend a couple hours, well worth the trek outside of the center of the city.

The puzzles etc set at just the right level of difficulty for both beginners and experienced gamers a like, with the odd hint here & there available should you get stuck, to keep the game moving at just the right pace.Don't hesitate to book this Escape Room you will not be disappointed & it is really easy to find, being just a 3 minute walk from London Fields Overground station.Like all Escape Rooms I'd suggest a quick look on google maps at street view to make sure you know how to find it.Enjoy !"

After the instructions, the game started. They do a wonderful job of immersing you into the game. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but overall, it was very well produced, and you get the sense that the organizers are watching what you're doing to the point that they will help steer you back in the right direction if you are too far out there. We didn't solve the puzzle - we got very close, and probably needed another 10 minutes. Still, this experience has had me looking for other escape room adventures. Highly recommended!"

It seemed so polished and scripted it became almost impersonal - Disney-fied and corporate.

Right from the beginning there was a lot of excitement when we had to turn up and ring the doorbell right on time. The actor in the first room was then very entertaining, joking with our group and delivering his instructions in an interactive and funny way. The experience itself was SO MUCH FUN. The puzzles are pretty difficult, but with a little bit of help from our robot friend we managed to get through - and two of the four groups succeeded in finding the lance!! One recommendation - make sure you actually read the clues properly before launching into trying to solve the puzzles... That would definitely have sped up our experience and made it a little less painful for the poor 'robot.'The theming throughout the experience is also amazing and makes for a really immersive game. You go through 3 rooms, each themed as different times in history, and the pressure to get through the rooms makes it a great team game. It was also super easy to make my group booking, and the team was super responsive and helpful the whole way through. The hour went far too quickly - I will definitely be back when they release a second run!! Side note - we booked Wringer and Mangle for drinks and nibbles. It is a 2 minute walk from Time Run and a really nice bar/restaurant."

In terms of the game itself, it is very involved and seemed a lot more along the lines of things like Crystal Maze than some of the other games I've done, which is - of course - a good thing! Brilliant puzzles (not too hard, not too easy) with hints just when we needed them. We weren't left on our own for too long when we'd come to a dead end, but equally were left alone to figure things out enough to make it satisfying. We were also given an extra five minutes as we were very close to solving the final puzzle, which was a nice touch - and great to figure it out for ourselves rather than have to leave frustrated.

Time Run is not an \"escape room\" - although there is one element that lovers of the classic \"live escape game\" will be quite satisfied with. It extends the concept to an experience, with the briefing performed by an actor (or if not - an exceptional host), and a \"characterised\" gamesmaster to assist you. It offers the \"crystal maze\" activity style puzzles, and, as I said, your classic escape as well all packaged in a truly superb set which enables you to completely subscribe to the concept.Yes, as some of the reviews have said, a lot of what happens needs human interaction - not that you can see it - it's stage managed extremely well, but this can mean that sometimes, if you complete a puzzle slightly unconventionally, you can be \"guided\" to do it again.Also, for people who come from far away, there isn't a lot around the area, and the time slot is very precise. Once you get in you'll see why - but you may want to either leave more time than you need to stop off to go to the loo etc beforehand, or be absolutely spot on to get in and use theirs. This is less of a problem for Londoners.People also talk about the cost - but the reality is, you get 2 hours entertainment (including being performed to, as well as totally immersed in a really high budget set, and challenged with puzzles) for half, if not a third the price of a theatre ticket. ...and if you compare it on cost to some of the other conventional escape rooms in London - Time Run's value for money is extremely clear.It is an excellent experience - and personally, I think better than the Crystal Maze (but I'm quite theatrical). It isn't a pure escape room, and it would sell escape rooms short to make a comparison on style. However, we loved it, and would happily recommend."

Mainly because I never really thought an immersive puzzle-solving game could be this good. As you reach the venue you are not disappointed as the entrance itself was designed to give the the 'Time Runners' an instant feel that they are entering a weird and mysterious event. Not to mention you won't have to spend time wondering if you got the right address.The event starts with a tutorial from a friendly 'Time Traveler' who, in my opinion, really puts himself into character. not to mention you can joke about with him and he'll respond in kind. Although do take it seriously when he talks about interacting with the environment because the last thing they, and your team, needs is to ruin the whole experience. Yes you have the freedom to touch and move things, but don't be forceful, it's Time-Travel, you don't want to create unnecessary butterfly effects :P. There are several time-zones that you visit during your adventures with really interesting, clever and engaging puzzles. Yes you can probably guess how to solve it but there is always help, in the form of an android, if you are really stuck. I guess this is one aspect which I wasn't sure whether it helped us or the other team (we were a group of friends competing against each other). So you never know if the android was using the same criteria to see if people are 'stuck'. This can affect the time in which you finish the puzzles. Overall it's very good. It's better when you're competing against another group of friends so I'd say bring around 8-10 people to form two groups.I am definitely going to it again if they set up new time-zones, so hurry up you lot and go on this Time-Run so they can start making new ones!"

What sets this one apart from other escape rooms is the entire story and setting. It's more than just a background murder/mystery setting though; from the beginning you're drawn into a whole creative and imaginative story and it really does feel like you're playing a game/in a movie! The rooms are all themed and the puzzles are themed accordingly to their environment which makes this truly a unique experience.The puzzles are challenging but not impossible, just the right amount!Also, our hosts were incredibly flexible. We booked 4 tickets but showed up with 6 people on the day, and we were able to pay for the extra 2 at the door with no hassle. Furthermore, majority of our team turned up incredibly late yet the hosts did everything possible to not have to turn them away which was very appreciated. (Although, I would recommend not being late by even a minute, as the entrance experience was really worth it and it was a shame the rest of our team missed it. Also, whilst they did accommodate us for 6 people, it was a bit too much, I'd say 4 players is the ideal number).The only negative I can say is the price, it is quite expensive. But whilst I wish the price was cheaper, I can honestly say that you shouldn't let the price be the deciding factor - this is so worth it, and i'm quite convinced we won't find another escape room as captivating as this!"

The production and design is amazing, lots of toys and gadgets to entertain. The introduction was really good (slightly long) with the host definitely giving it his all. Without giving anything away, some parts were brilliant classic escape game stuff (3rd part) but some were more physical and too many instructions were given from the get go. It may be fun if you are planning on following instructions/doing more physical activities and seeing an outcome but not if you are hoping to use your wits to think your way out. This may be from just two of us playing the game and hence we felt some activities were more time consuming rather than a puzzle but that part will definitely suit new gamers in a larger group. I'm sure they will find this very fun. Overall, it's definitely one of the best ranked ones out there and in terms of production, maybe even the best, but somehow, for us, only the last part of the game was excellent, the first two, not the best due to reasons mentioned."

The whole set-up is expertly done and literally takes you back in time igniting your imagination beyond the real. Before arrival to the venue, you are greeted by a majestic set of doors that open sideways, and greeted immediately by professionals that are in character the whole duration of your journey. You are well looked after and i thought that every staff member I came across was amazing at looking after us, answering our questions, and best of all making our experience that much more.....I will not reveal anything about the journey or its contents. That is for you to discover and experience. :-)A team of 4 is the right amount of people to be taking part and anything more in my opinion would be too many bodies which could prove problematic in terms of space and team play in general.

Multiple time slots and themed rooms run simultaneously so more chance of getting a reservation than at other escape rooms that only have one set of rooms running per hour. Three consecutive themed rooms in this venue. They jump in with hints in a non-invasive way as well. Good attention to detail in the rooms. Took our 13 year old.

The most, fantastic, fast paced fun adrenaline fuelled adventure through time with friends on a Friday.

The end puzzle is still baffling us, definitely be going back to try again (after some intensive team training!)"

Truly - I don't usually write sensational reviews- but there is no other way to describe the fun that we had. I would recommend this for anyone - take your mum, you nephew, your workmates - you will have a great time. From the moment you arrive outside the ornate door with the mysterious door bell - you are sucked into another time, total immersion in the game and oodles of fun!"

However, after arriving on time it wasn't for another 35 minutes before we started our game, After being briefed by the actor in reception, we had what was another 5 minute brief via video. Then at the end there was another debrief and to be honest I'd rather talk about the experience between my group on the way out rather than hear about what the \"staff\" thought about our game. Just all seems a bit over kill. The game itself was fantastic, well put together and the whole grouped enjoyed it. It would have got 5 stars if there was less talking, well worth a visit."

But the second you see the ornate doors of Time Run, you know you're in for a good time! The door bell states only ring when it's you're allotted time. When you do, the large door slides up and shuts again. (There was someone banging on it after 5 mins, was not sure if they were late or had forgotten something, but the doors were not re-opened for anyone!)There are various escape rooms throughout London but I chose this one as it didn't mean being locked in just one room for the entire time and this is reflected in the price. The idea is to solve clues so you can journey through various days in time. The clues were clever and the four of us thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff are not going to be winning any oscars any time soon but they help explain the day very well. Would love to rebook and do it all again (hopefully get a little further next time as still not sure how many rooms (spaces in time!) they actually have. The fact that they give you a review of your puzzle solving skills at the end is a great bonus. Truly engaging and awesome experience."

As soon as you walk through those bronze doors; invited in by the excellent actor who plays his role with conviction and obvious delight you feel fully immersed in the fantastical world Time Run have created for you. Costumes, rooms and props have been created with attention to detail to film set quality standards. A good mixture of puzzles in perfectly themed rooms follows with an impending sense of jeopardy created by having a timer counting down the hour you have left to escape. This is only the second escape room I have done but I can't see how it could be done better than this. Highly recommended!"

Firstly, there is no welcoming area, you just have to wait for your time slot in the street, even if it's raining, thought inside, the is enough space to place a sofa at least. Secondly, we asked if it is warm inside the rooms, the guide told us that \"it will be getting warmer\", but in reality it was really freezing, the rooms are so cold that you'd better stay in you puffer coat if you have one, it's physical torture to be there. Thirdly, the guide himself was so unfrienly and unwelcoming, he put us off immediately by making some sarcastic jokes and rude comments of us, which were really low, for example, he said to the guy who is relly thin and not very tall \"i see you are the strongest here\". It was so strange to find such an ungentlemanly behaviour in a person who is supposed to be \"a Victorian gentleman\". Moreover, his accent was not very clear and when we asked him questions he made fun of us in a rude manner! Fourthly, strangely enough we had to wait for the other team (who was running late) to join us, though, it was not written on the site that there will be another team at all. Why should we be dependent on some other people? Fifthly, there is no logic in the puzzles at all and you understand quite fast that it is not you who play the game, but instead, you are being played: the riddles are solved not by you, but by \"operators\" of the game, who push the button at a certain time. You are even given some clues when you don't want to and that can be skipped, really. Though the operators keep a very close eye on you and your progress (which is very considerate and attentive), from the beginning to the end there is no sense of achievement as you realize that it was not you, who made the progress, you just don't believe in it! There are so many clues written everywhere, so many texts - just because without them it's impossible to solve the problems as they are absolutely illogical and not coherent. Though the idea is very interesting, there is so much potential in it, the rooms are not connected in a logical manner. It was not worth the money and it doesn't deserve all the positive reviews."

We went as a family of four including two teenage boys. The location is in an up and coming \"hipster\" section of London; we took public transportation to get there with no problems as it is an easy walk from the London Fields over-ground train stop taken from the Liverpool Street station. We were greeted by a very funny actor (a bit of a young David Mitchell lookalike) dressed in a Victorian England costume who explained \"the quest\" to the two teams there, and then we were off. We had a bit over an hour to solve clues and puzzles in order to advance over three rooms, each from a different era of time, with lots of helpful hints thrown our via various mediums way by an out-of-sight mentor watching our progress. It was mentally challenging and fun, and a great family team building experience as we had to work hard and fast together to solve the clues to advance to the next room. At the end of the quest, we received an evaluation of our team's efforts in an official debriefing. Well worth the admission price, I would recommend this highly to families with teenagers or older, or to teams from a workplace. Hope to see this in the USA soon!"

We thought the introduction bit was a bit too laboured, and would've preferred to potentially have used this time to have a bit more time to complete the mission. The main bit that we struggled on was that it was far too dark to see some of the things that needed to be seen. I realise this was probably to aid atmosphere, but it costs us valuable time and did make some members of the team feel a but redundant at times. I also think the extra time at the end may be good to potentially go see some of the other rooms again o take photos, much like other immersive productions. Overall, would recommend, but not sure if it would be too hard for younger members of the family to partake in. However, really good fun."

The story is that you are being transported between time zones with a different set of challenges in each zone, which are linked by portals - doors which unlock once the challenge is complete. It is real fun, and our entire group had a good time - I have recommended it to management at my office as Time Run would make a great team bonding exercise.

However, this has obviously been put together with great thought, love and care. Which makes a really enjoyable hour, and you get a real sense of achievement when your team achieves every puzzle.This is a tricky review to write because you want to say everything that was good about it without spoiling the event for others.Needless to say there are countless things that are good about this escape room. I felt like I was in the crystal maze for an hour.There is plenty of scope for this company to make many more escape rooms in the same format.

Personalised hints were given to us when it seemed that we had started to get stuck, and the quality of the whole experience was extremely high.After we managed to escape (5 minutes after the timer went off), we were given a run down of our performance by a member of the \"extraction team\" and shown our prize. All the hosts remained in character, and were very helpful and accommodating.One word of caution: Have a team name in mind when you go. You have to choose one before you go in, and since nobody in my team is particularly good at acting under pressure, many jokes and bad puns were had at the expense of team \"Craig David\""

After an amusing introduction by your immaculately attired host, off you go on an adventure through time, tackling team challenges in an attempt to save the world. If you have seen Crystal Maze you have an idea of what to expect, except that there are no physical challenges. Your mum could, for example, do this. What struck me most was the attention to detail. Your host is permanently in character. The challenges have a very high production quality. This makes the experience very immersive. If you are prepared to enter into the spirit of it and embrace it you will have a great time."

I've heard about these sorts of games from friends, but had never expected the whole experience to be so immersive. From the moment we stepped through the door, we'd entered an old-timey extravaganza, and although we definitely all that the giggles for the first few minutes, the next hour was deadly serious. I was continually impressed by the attention to detail and the design in general. The graphics were fantastic, and the props felt well-crafted and added to the sense of realism. We quite happily could have spent two hours rather than just the one in the place, and there wasn't at all a sense of wanting to get out after the final challenge. The staff were brilliant at their roles, and the live response of them during the challenge was very impressive."

From the very get-go at the golden gate to the final escape through the last portal it is a thrilling adventure through time and space itself. Beautiful decors, realistic acting and quite original puzzles. One can indeed see what one payed for. A few minuscule points of criticism is that there is slightly too little time for the players to solve the puzzles themselves which means you might be getting hints before you have had a chance to solve things yourselves."

If you've ever seen the Crystal Maze you'll know what to expect - rooms with puzzles that you have to solve to progress through to the next room, a time limit and increasing dopamine hits as your team gets closer to the ultimate goal of finding the missing artefact. From the moment you go through the door into Aubrey's early Edwardian office, you are immersed in the world of Luna Fox and her intelligent clockwork man, Babbage. The rooms are beautifully created and very detailed. You have real-time chats with Babbage as you make your way through and at every stage the puzzles are a stretch but doable by a team of 3-5 (well, we did it with a team of 3, but with only 7 seconds left on the clock, so a fourth team member might have made it a little less fraught!). You don't need any special historical knowledge to do the puzzles as all the information you need is provided, though it doesn't hurt to google the name of the artefact you're looking for before you get there (for us it was the Lance of Longinus) just for a bit of background interest - it makes no difference for solving the puzzles. Would probably need at least 3 adults per team but it is suitable for a teenager to be on your team, too. Takes no more than an hour (there's a time limit on the game) and is slick and well-paced. London Fields has plenty of cafes and pubs nearby for before and afterwards, and it's about ten minutes' walk from Hackney Central station. Not really very easy for wheelchair access although I think it would just about be doable (though I'd contact them to check what they think first). They have storage for bags, and toilets before you go in. I thoroughly recommend this for an afternoon out."

Quite pricey at \u00a330 for an esape room in London, but once you see the rooms, props and graphis used you'll understand why.Time Run is one of the better escape room's in London, without giving too much away, the clues and puzzles are imaginative and original that requires team work to get them done. You really do need at least 3. I think 4 is the ideal number, 5 might be a bit much! The main concept is time travel, in my opinion that is better than the usual 'you are a detective' storyline.An hour doesnt feel like long to crack the 3 rooms, and I liked how you are trying to retrieve an ancient artifact, instead of actually trying to escape.Great fun, and worth the extra money"

I've played lots of escape rooms (elsewhere), but nothing quite like Time Run, and I mean that in the best possible way.It's not just the impeccably in-character greeting that you receive before embarking on your quest, or the dazzlingly high production values that await. Every puzzle is embedded seamlessly into the narrative, with parts of the experience playing out more as a natural exploration of the environment (you're Time Runners, of course you're investigating your surroundings) rather than having the \"we're in an escape room, what do we do now\" sort of feel. The special effects and very responsive rooms only add to the immersion.Admittedly, if you pursue the Lance of Longinus with puzzles as your priority, you might be disappointed. Some tasks are heavier on execution than inspiration, and could come across as tiresome (especially if you're in a smaller group). The adherence to plot also means that there are few 'pure' puzzles of the cryptic, multilayered sort you might expect in a typical escape room, and more of just figuring out what's going on.But that's just quibbling. As a sheer experience, Time Run is something I'd recommend to anyone. Arrive ready to have an adventure."

My sister bought me tickets as a birthday present. I carefully selected my three most intelligent friends to give us the best chance of victory. As someone who watched The Crystal Maze all the time as a kid, and plays lots of computer games (Resident Evil & Zelda puzzles spring to mind), this was perfect for me. The puzzles were set at just the right level, and challenging enough to give a real sense of achievement when you solve them. They are also varied enough not to feel repetitive. The sets and props are wonderful and provided a terrific sense of escapism. There are also useful clues if you're stuck. The time limit was perfect - we managed to complete the challenge with seconds remaining, which added a genuine thrill to the experience. My tips would be: 1) Choose your team carefully; 2) Go to the toilet at the start; 3) Be hasty, otherwise you will run out of time! My team started at quite a leisurely pace which made the end of the game a mad rush. The staff were great and really enhanced the experience. Book your place now, you won't regret it!"

Amazing introduction, great decoration, decent story, good puzzles. If you want to criticise then I can only pick out two things - there's a lack of amazing puzzles and the \"debrief\" was OK, but not amazing. It costs about a tenner more than its competitors, but it's still much better value for money, especially when you factor in that the introduction and scene setting here genuinely feel like entertainment.Stop wavering and book!"

The production value is quite high, the actor who greets you and the decor when you enter make the whole thing immersive from the start. I liked the time travel theme, and was impressed by the quality of the room design (there are several rooms/periods to progress through to find the solution).

Thrilling, dramatic, exciting, tense ... it had it all.From the very start, being allowed through the Secret Door in London Fields, greeted by the handsome, twinkly, always-in-character Aubrey, and launched through a series of brilliantly actualized Time Portals, we were enthralled and captivated by this breathlessly immersive experience.Like walking into a computer game come to life - with the best 3-D graphics - and the most playable puzzles (a little like The Room 2 if you know that one.) They were challenging but doable for a team working together - and always fun and inventive, perfectly themed for the 'era' to which you had been transported.Nothing like I'd expected - far, far better - I'd give it the highest possible rating. It really was unique, and beautifully realised in terms of atmosphere, theming, playability.Tip 1: there's a little bit of not-too-demanding physical activity involved. Wear comfy clothes. Go to the loo when offered at the start.Tip 2: Don't waste any time admiring the convincing, beautiful and surprising 'rooms'. No dithering around! You need to get your team looking and thinking from the very start. Don't ever give up! there will be clues and breakthroughs.Tip 3: not much in London Fields (easily reached by overground train from Liverpool Street station, you can use your underground travel pass or Oyster of course if local) but there is a park by the Lido to sit in to calm your nerves before facing your challenge, and the trendy E5 Bakehouse for an excellent coffee and the 'best sourdough in London' under one of the railway archesTip 4: really, don't waste any time. Listen carefully to Babbage, your helpful clue-bot. Read everything. Get to work looking and finding even before you're sure how it all adds up.Tip 5: your experience starts the moment you get through the door. Be prepared to banter with Aubrey in a manner suited to a bygone age. We were taken by surprise - he was witty and urbane, we stood there like four lemons with our mouths agape and looking like the worst duffers who ever showed up. He must have been secretly sure the four of us would Play Like (the proverbial Red Dwarf) Puddings, but not a hint of that showed in his courteous manner. I'd do it again tomorrow in a heartbeat. Please, PLEASE let the same team come up with another adventure!"

Straight from the entering through the enticing door you are immediately plunged into the scenario - even safety tips are given in the context of the story. The standard of the sets was excellent, the puzzles intriguing and the whole experience was far better than I could have anticipated - I thought we would literally spend the whole time in one room but no - there are several time zones to progress through. Clues are given only when needed to help you move through the game and the time just whizzed by. I would definitely go to another event by this group - perhaps they missed a trick in having two identical stories running simultaneously ? Two different ones would definitely have ensured we rebooked for the other. Well done - a great afternoon."

Just to get us out.Also if English is not your first language, you probably won't have such a good experience, as some clues were audio and reading which seemed stressful for some members. Shorter intro and extra time in the room would have felt less stressful. When we finished we had a five second review and then we were shown the door! This place is expensive for what you get and there are better escape games around offering cheaper value and better customer service and satisfaction. "

Would be very good for people who want to have the adventure experience without scary bits. The set was very detailed and the acting was good too. Had a great day, thanks."

A bit nervous as I had never done anything like it before but I shouldn't have been, it was fantastic.I don't want to give too much away as that is half the fun but the things that impressed me most were the overall production value - attention to detail, sense of where you were - and the intricacy of the games. They were complex and built upon each other wonderfully.Thank you Time Run for a fantastic experience - please let Luna go on another adventure soon!"

The staff here are outstanding; extremely good at their job, wonderful to interact with, their commitment to staying in character throughout is tremendous and adds to the fun considerably. The game environments look, feel and sound superb and atmospheric; after we had escaped, I wanted to go back in and just play in them.The puzzles are... merely good, rather than matching the amazing standards of the aesthetics. We all went \"Ooh\" at how pretty they looked and how well they fit in to the themes, but they didn't make us go \"Ahh\" at how clever they were. They were enjoyable, and the degree of teamwork they emphasised was delightful, but they were not startling in their originality, and progress felt rather linear. The level of difficulty was appropriate and well-chosen; the level of depth and interconnectedness was... notably weaker than the rest of the experience.Upon leaving, our debriefing (while appropriate and perfectly charming) was a little overtly commercial and this left a slightly sour taste in the mouth. It was done as tastefully as it could have been, but it can never be completely tasteful. Another review suggests that the tactic may be actively counterproductive.Bear in mind that Time Run is rather more expensive than its competitors; even noting London rental rates, it's clear where the money has gone and where little or no expense has been spared. For such a high price, the game has to be held to the highest standards - I'd have to be convinced of excellence in the puzzles, rather than just high competence, to want to go back and pay top dollar for a second adventure - and that makes this a high four-star review rather than a low five-star review."

We're veterans at these games in London and this was by far our favourite so far, thanks mostly to the superb attention to detail, the set design and the commitment of the staff to the time travelling set up. We were genuinely excited every time we opened a new portal and the puzzles and challenges (while maybe not some of the toughest we've faced) were all great fun, inventive and carried through the narrative nicely. You only get as many hints as you need and as always with these events, the time just flies by. Wonderful stuff - really hoping the Time Run team come up with a new storyline for us to come back to."

I have done other escape games before, but this one was by far the most professionally executed, well-designed and outright fun.

Clues are given out in each room over video link if you are struggling, so all levels of ability are catered for. Each of the three main rooms are quite distinctively different in theme and content which adds to the experience and ensures things don't get boring or repetitive. I would recommend this experience to pretty much anyone, the cost is less than you will pay to watch premier league football in London, and the experience is much more rewarding and enjoyable (said as a keen West Ham fan).

I'll leave it at that so not to ruin the experience but the story itself was well put together and the room was so much fun. The puzzles were also unique, albeit a bit complicated at times but that's what to be expected from an escape room. I like that they judge whether you need a hint or not vs other rooms where you are left wandering for a bit and become stubborn to ask for one. The clues were also presented very clearly, again as compared to some other rooms where you need to understand a person over a walkie talkie.DO NOT be late tho, a couple of us were about 15 min late unfortunately and they couldn't let us in. They were nice enough to stay later and give us a time slot later in the evening but only because there was availability. In summary, if you like escape rooms and immersive experiences you won't be disappointed! Highly recommended!"

I don't want to give anything away but each room really felt like a completely new world. It's really easy to set Escape Games in an office or some other mundane real world situation, so the fact that the organisers went in completely the opposite direction is really impressive.As for the puzzles themselves, they range between the pretty simple to the kind you could spend hours trying to solve. Unfortunately, you don't have hours so you and your team will need to really work together to complete everything in time.(If this sounds scary, don't worry! Hints are offered along the way to help things moving along)The sense of achievement when you solve a particularly tricky puzzle is amazing. And now I'm trying to get all my pals to go so I can compare notes with them. Also, on a less fancy level, it's super close to the station!Go! Have a brilliant time! And send my love to Babbage!"

This is the perfect way to spend an afternoon or an evening. I did it with two friends and we all had a blast! Would definitely recommend for anyone visiting London as something not to miss!"

            "review": "The best of its kind. Since the 'live room escape' genre really kicked off in the UK about 2 years ago, I have become a bit of an addict and have been to numerous different ones, mainly in London. Most have been fun, they've all had the good points and bad points, but all have left me thinking about certain things which could have been done better.Until now. This week I took part in Time Run for my brother's birthday. It surpassed all expectations, and is head and shoulders above any of the other room escapes I have been to. Like, 10 times better. If you're interested in room escapes / immersive experiences enough to be reading this review, I can assure you that you'll love every second of Time Run.Compared to other Room Escapes in London, here are the points where Time Run excels:- Clearly a bigger budget than others. The technology and props are slicker, the production is more polished, and the rooms are more like sets from a film - definitely like something straight from the Crystal Maze.- Fully immersive - as soon as you walk through the mysterious wooden sliding door (even THAT is cool), the person who greets and briefs you is in character. The entrance area itself is fully kitted out with mysterious objects, and feels part of the time travel storyline.- There's quite a bit of humour - it doesn't take itself too seriously.- The theming of the different rooms is excellent and varied.- The puzzles and games are brilliantly designed. Other room escapes have left me frustrated sometimes, when puzzle solutions are too obscure or seemingly random, rather than following a logical process that you can work out with the clues provided. For example, finding lots of 3 and 4 digit numbers, with no logic or direction about what needs to be used where, or why.But Time Run avoided this problem more successfully than any of the others. I always felt like I grasped how the various elements of the games linked together, and there were always clues about what needed to be used where. There weren't too many distracting red herrings, and even better, the puzzles seemed to fit in well with the storyline and have reasons behind them, rather than being random, abstract and contrived. This shows a level of expertise that went into the design that I haven't yet seen elsewhere.At the end we came out with a feeling of having just experienced something really memorable and extraordinary, and immediately wanting to do another hour of it. I was thinking about it for the rest of the day. And most of the next day too.My only advice would be, if you're new to room escapes and likely to try out a few, don't do this one first, because the others (which are still very fun) will not live up to the expectations you have after this."

We've done a lot of puzzle rooms around London and other countries.The experience part of this room blows them all away, really making you feel like there's a story and you're part of it. From the entrance door to the whole building, to the characters (both physical and digital), to the story, it keeps you engaged the whole time. Every other room does a dry one minute \"here's a crap story for the room, and the rules\". Not here.The puzzle bit is pretty high on the list two. A few different bits we'd never seen before in other rooms as well as some tried and trued thing. The ending had a bit of a disjointed feeling to it, but otherwise it was all logical and you could progress easily.Only other downside was being rushed out afterwards without much time to review the room with them. We met one of the designers outside though and he said they're currently building a post-run room to decompress in (otherwise we're just blocking the stairwell there), so sounds like that'll be fixed soon.Well worth doing!"

However it is very interactive, lots of things to move around etc. Is very cleverly done.He set up is more impressive than some competitors but the story/ clues don't quite hit the mark for me.If you have never been- GO.

The clues never felt patronising, and were more like gentle nudges towards a part of the room that hadn\u2019t been looked at yet. When one of our party sneezed, Babbage even said \u201cbless you\u201d, which really added to the already high level of immersion in the game.If I could praise one thing above all with Time Run, it\u2019d have to be the frankly blockbuster-level production value, with each room and each puzzle looking and working like a slicker version of \u201cThe Crystal Maze\u201d.TL:DR go do Time Run, it\u2019s the closest you\u2019ll ever come to being Indiana Jones."

I won\u2019t give too much away, as the journey is all about working out the puzzle for yourself, with the help of Babbge too of course! We spilt ourselves into two groups, went on the same journey, solved the puzzle and saved the sword for Luna Fox, and all humanity! If you\u2019ve ever watched the crystal maze and screamed at the idiotic contestants as they fail to understand how a game works, or thought how you would do better \u2013 this is for you. We all walked out and wanted another go!"

The game itself was very well considered and the styling of each part really impressive and convincing. With that in mind it was good value too because the attention to detail was so good.

A little research indicated that this was a 'escape from a room' experience with a bunch of puzzles and lots of 'moving parts'. It was certainly that and more.First, you enter what appears to be a small business unit with a rather strange door into a sort of office with a variety of almost steam-punk artifacts around the walls and spread on the tables, and receive a briefing which cleverly both sets the scene and gets you in the right mood for what it to come. Then your group is transferred to where the action begins and start trying to work out what is relevant, what's not, and begin trying to work out what to do. It is at the same time challenging, funny, confusing, and you get a real kick out of each little advance. The approach we took was a mixture of guesswork, inspiration, logic, confusion and not having a clue interspersed with exhilaration as something works! Gradually (probably too gradually) we got the hang of interacting with the environment and began to progress.The design is superb, everyone in the team needs to work both individually and collaboratively, the sets are excellent, there is a real sense of excitement and threat, but not so much you are distracted from the job in hand. I would strongly suggest that anyone interested books early, because there's limited capacity and this is going to be a huge hit."

My friends and I have done all 3 of their escape rooms (because of an early-bird discount), with 1 month in between each.We have done a lot of escape rooms, in London and elsewhere, so we have a lot to compare with and my review might differ a lot from other reviewers for this reason.The good:- Friendly staff.- With an early-bird discount, it was quite cheap for London.The average:- The puzzles are just OK. Some a bit stretched... Newbies will probably enjoy them since the newly discovered concept of escape room is thrilling but will likely need clues for the stretched ones. Experienced puzzle solvers will probably not find them very exciting.- Atmosphere: there is a small effort on decoration, but this is far from full inception.The bad:- 2 out of the 3 escape rooms we have done had mistakes: the first time, we escaped before having opened all the locks because one clue had been left accidentally on the table. The second time, one lock combination had been changed, hence the right combination didn't work. It took 5+ minutes for the game master to realize it and eventually let us know how to proceed. This shows not much application and we were quite disappointed not to have the full experience.- There are tons of locks to open... And no clue as of which ones to open with which combination, so we spend our time trying the different combinations we find on ALL the locks. This wastes time and doesn't bring much value to the game... Overall, this was probably some of the worst escape rooms we have done in London. Yet, if this is your first time at an escape room, not having anything to compare with, you'll probably appreciate the concept and the warm welcome anyway."

            "review": "Average game with poor game masters. We have played all three games from Escape London. Each member of our team has played minimum of 10 games. Positives:All three games are in renovated and clean premises. Each game is different to the remaining ones and are thoroughly sticking to each theme.Less positive things:1) Leonardo da Vinci game: puzzles in this game are not very difficult. What spoiled our experience was that the game masters forgot to hide one important clue, which allowed us (unintentionally to short-circuit about 1/3 of the game. Since this resulted in extremely short finishing time, we were allowed back to the room and \"finish\" the unsolved puzzles. The overall feeling of accomplishment was gone though.2) Area 51 - This was the second game we played with this company. (We booked all three games at the same time) This game contained some more interesting puzzles, but also annoying number of identical lockers, which had to be all opened using codes made of digits. Yawn. Also, one locker's code didn't work, which meant that we wasted some 10 minutes trying to get in various variations of numbers of which we were sure it was the correct answer. When we asked for a hint, we were unnecessarily given clues to steps which we have already solved until eventually we were given the same number we already had. When we finally managed to communicate to the game masters, that we've already tried these number, he concluded that we must have somehow stumbled upon a master code and reset the code. Seriously? Since we missed out on clue hidden in this broken locker, we had to skip the following puzzle and go straight to the next locker. To top it off, after the game finished, the game master made some awkward joke about gynaecological instruments (one of the props in the game). Ew.3) Casino game - this was the last game we played in Escape London. This time all the props and clues were where they were supposed to be. This game was nicely and thematically decorated, however also contained multiple lockers with padlock - and since we didn't know which puzzle is connected to which locker, it meant trying each code in some 10 different padlocks. Not exactly fun.Overall, I'm sure you can find many much better games in London for similar money."

Being a new venue, it was not as high-tech or elaborate as some other escape games and the space was quite small for 6 people, however, the tasks were challenging and we all had a great time. The hosts were very friendly and made sure we had a good experience. Great value for money"

We selected the Da Vinci Room, which is a medium level room and if we have extra 15 minutes we might escape. :) It was great fun, thanks again."

Last Monday, we played all three rooms at Escape London with some friends, and we had a great time! The Casino room is a brilliantly fun twist on the traditional escape room, with a unique twist that would definitely appeal to the more competitive teams with a little extra challenge along escaping.Area 51 managed to stump us again and again, but it contains quite a few nice little puzzles and tricks that all make sense when you put 1 + 1 together.Lastly, we played the Da Vinci themed room, where we once again had great fun rummaging through the room. This is where our team truly shone, and where we set a record for quickest time with least clues! Gem of a room!The hosts are brilliant and friendly, and obviously care much about the business. They may be new on the block, but we highly recommend visiting Escape London for newbies and experienced players alike. We hope to see them around for a long time, and hope they'll open some new rooms soon so we can be back!"

Lovely warm welcome, some refreshments and really funny hosts. We played the casino room first which was our absolute favourite! Nice different vibe to your more traditional escape room experience, very light hearted and very, very fun!Next was Area 51 which was another great room, tricky but in all the right ways. We finished with the Da Vinci room which rounded our trip off nicely! Even sweeter because we escaped all 3 within the time limit, but they weren't easy!! Absolutely recommend and wish these guys all the best and hope they have some new rooms on offer soon! Thanks again :)"

I expected much more interactivity. To make everything worse, some padlocks didn't work very well and refused to open even when we found a correct key which made us waste so much time. Also the 20% discount on their website didn't work when I booked. They gave me after the code with 50% discount but I'm not sure if I'll go to try other rooms there."

Having tried an escape room abroad on our holidays, we were keen to do ones in London on our return and, being fairly local, we happened across Escape London and have tried two of their three rooms so far, coming close on the first and beating the second!Some of the clues are more obtuse than others, but for the most part they are solvable, sometimes with hints, without leaving you scratching your heads.The hints themselves are helpful but not too quick, so you do have to do the work yourselves. We took our kids, 9 & 5, who both enjoyed themselves, almost as much as we did, and who were both able to play a valuable part. We have yet to take on their hardest room, the Casino Room, but after Area 51 and the Da Vinci Room, we can't wait. What really sells Escape London though is the team behind it, who are without exception friendly and welcoming, to adults & kids alike. We will be back!"

You can tell this is a dull franchise chain opened for the sake of a business, not for the love of escape rooms.The Da Vinci room is best out of a bad bunch as it is marginally more varied and less linear. The other two rooms are very disappointing because their main focus is a tall locker of approximately seven padlocks in a row. Out of over 20 escape rooms, this is probably the laziest and unimaginative way to present puzzles that I've encountered! It's takes immersion out of the room and condenses it into joyless unlinked little tasks.Two of the rooms had staff resetting errors where a few codes were unlocked, one of which was confusingly game breaking. To be honest, I think the overall rating should be two stars, but I acknowledge that they have just opened. The rooms are adequate and perfunctory, but with so many other good escape rooms in London, it's not worth going to this venue."

The place was easy to find (about a ten minute walk from Queen's Park) and upon arriving we received a really friendly welcome and were talked through what we needed to do. The escape room was really well set up and clues were readily available when we needed them. The difficulty was brillIant as it certainly wasn't easy but was definitely manageable. Would 100% recommend this escape room and I hope to see more escape rooms from this company in the future. Thanks again for a great afternoon!"

And it was amazing: First the ambience is set before you enter the room with a little video briefing (low budget but it doesn't matter). Then once you enter the room, it's something else: the decor is wonderful and very immersive. Every detail is thought out and it really made us forget that it is a game: it feels like we are actually trying to save the world! The game is really well set, specially for a first experience. We didn't feel lost. If you are stuck the team can request a hint to help the progression. It was a great experience and i would like to erase my mind to be able to do it again!"

The game was accommodating - if you were stuck and she helped with some clues if we asked for it. So it was not so stressful, but at the same time it was thrilling. I'd suggest it for a group of atleast 3 (we were 4) because there are quite a lot of puzzles/clues to solve for and there's enough work for everyone! Not so pricey and comfortable location in West london, so didnt have to go all the way into the City for this. Also recommended for corporate team building - great for team work. On the whole, great stuff! Try it out!"

Some have been amazing and some have been so bad that I've contemplated calling the police to report an assault, such was the pain I felt upon leaving certain rooms. HOWEVER, the authorities are not needed here! This room was great. The difficulty was spot on. Nothing was immediately clear, but given time to think, it made sense in the end. The difficulty curve was perfect. I know this is subjective, but for me, it was spot on. There are some really nice ideas in this room. There was always something to do. If you got stuck in one area, you could leave it and move on to something else and then go back later. I've been to rooms where the puzzles were too linear and you had to solve one after the other. They have just the right amount of red herrings as well.It's a relatively new escape room and I took a chance on it, and I'm glad I did. I highly recommend it to everyone. The owner was lovely as well. I can't remember her name sadly, but she was really nice to speak to and we spoke to her at length at the end to give feedback on the room which she was really grateful for.Don't be put off by the exterior. Being completely honest, it does look a bit \"run-down\" on the outside. However once inside the room, you are transported to a different world entirely and it's game time!It doesn't surprise me that this room is as good as it is. The owners are Hungarian and some of the best rooms I've played were in Hungary. It actually has a Hungarian Escape Room feel to it."

The room had good theming, the puzzles were mixed (not just padlocks) and some innovative ideas/things that we hadn't seen in other rooms!After we escaped, our host was friendly and chatty and asked us for any feedback on how they could improve the room. We offered a couple of suggestions, which they seemed happy to take on board.We're hoping Mind the Game expand as we would definitely return for another room and will be recommending this to others!"

Anyways we finally enter the room and without giving too much away we were faced with mind boggling challenges, yet I was lucky enough to have two team members (my son n husband) who just thrive on these things. All in all we finished with 4 minutes to go and only used one hint on what we found to be quite a tricky task. And apparently that day we were the first team so far to escape!!

Most of the puzzles were more biased towards thinking and logic, less on the practical so it may suit some better than others. Unfortunately we didn't manage to escape in time, but a good laugh anyway. I'd say it's ideal for adults and late teens, but not children. Definitely a good venue for a works day out."

The aim was to escape the room within an hour (or as quickly as possible) by solving a number of puzzles. The puzzles/riddles varied and required different types of thinking. This meant we had to work together and play to each other's strengths. Everybody had a moment to shine and, with a bit of hard work, we eventually escaped the room. The staff were really friendly and would offer the odd hint. Rather than spoil the experience, it prevented us from getting frustrated and allowed us to keep making progress.Possibly a little bit on the pricey side, but definitely a nice treat. Would certainly go back to do the other room."

They really could just show a short video with someone in relevant costume explaining the backstory and the rules rather than leaving this to the staff, who are after all in plain clothes. The lady was very friendly and did a good job, but a sense of occasion was definitely missing at the beginning. The room itself was fantastic, with loads of varied and fun puzzles to solve. It was so cleverly constructed and I'd say the level of difficulty was very well pitched. There are hints over the radio if you get stuck. We were doing this with just two people, though the suggested minimum is three, but being keen on this kind if thing we were determined to solve it and escape. We were really in the moment, this is brilliantly executed. After we finished and made the wall of fame, we got a photo and some great memories to take home.

It was a lot of fun, not easy at all, you need to think outside of the box and use all the clues to solve the puzzle. We needed to use some hints to guide us in the right way, this helped us to figure out the way to use the clues for other puzzles. Only problem we had was the lady giving us hints via the walkie talkie had a strong American accent and unfortunately for us, via the walkie talkie we struggled to understand some of what she was saying, I hope she takes no offence but we struggled to understand and that led to further confusion. The lady was lovely and very helpful and the mentioned struggle can not be helped, so we just had to work with it. We did complete the puzzle with only 1min 40secs to spare lol! It's definitely something different to try, it's fun, it's a good bonding experience and there's lot's to talk about after.

Our family consisted of 2 (young) seniors, 2 parents and 2 teens and we completed the room with 45 seconds to spare, making it onto the wall of fame. We felt the difficulty level was pretty much perfect (although we did need a few hints to get done in the hour).Free water and lockers are provided. There are no real physical requirements and I would imagine anyone from 8-80 would enjoy it. Just dress comfortably and take your wits!Allow 1.5 hours for the whole experience. I would definitely recommend it and will be going back to try the other room soon."

It was a bit tricky to get our head around some of them but nonetheless we probably used parts of our brain we don't usually use! The puzzles were well planned and an hour is more than enough. The 6 of us managed to complete the puzzles and light the fire for the gods (not real fire) in the Pharaohs Chamber with just 1.5 minutes left! Definitely worth the trip and if you make it you get to have a photo taken and be placed on the hall of fame. (There are a lot there already) Highly recommended."

I don't want to give away too much detail but their website outlines the premise.Locked in a room we had an hour to find all the clues and gradually piece it all together to help us escape. It was great fun, everyone loved it and we escaped with 4 minutes to spare!They give you clues via a walkie talkie, so no need to despair if you're really struggling. And they won't kick you out if you get to the time limit without completing it, so you don't need to fear never knowing how it ended! It's honestly such great fun trying to work together to escape the room. It's walking distance from London Bridge station, and the staff were enthusiastic. Just make sure you check and remember EVERYTHING, and note it all down if you need to!"

Luckily the staff are very helpful and give you 3 hints should you need them as well as help push you in the right direction.I though the room would be quite small and dark which was a bit of a worry as one of the team can get claustrophobic but it was a large very well lit room.Definitely recommend, we are already organizing a day to do the second room."

The hint system they have is great, a few well timed hints through the walkie talkie is just what you need to set you on the right track without spoiling the puzzles, our member of staff never just simply told us what to do. We ended up escaping with 27 seconds left, which made for some pretty intense stuff!

We were given a walkie talkie to get hints from the host.Location was good, not too difficult to look for as it is close to the underground station. Premise was clean with simple decoration with many previous players photos on the walls.The game itself was great, involving some interesting technologies rather than locks after locks. In fact, there wasnt many pad locks, which I was pretty impressed. The puzzles fit into the theme of the game. The puzzles were all well planned though one or two of them were a bit too difficult and maybe a little illogical/insolvable without a hint from the gamemaster. The set was a little dull and basic.The puzzles were quite difficult and i wouldnt recommend it to those who are new to escape game. We managed to escape with a few mins left.We were asked to take a group photo in the end and were given pens to draw on, (to be put on the wall of fame!) which was a nice touch to end the experience.

The staff give you a limited number of tips via a walkie talkie, which to be fair is a massive help and you can ask an unlimited number of yes/no questions. I think most teams would struggle with no tips at all.Overall I'd say great fun and would highly recommend, it's something new that I've never seen before.My only tip would be to incorporate it with a day out etc. as the game only lasts an hour at the longest and wouldn't be worth travelling to London for just to play the game.

The staff were helpful and reassured us via the radio that we were well on the right track and eventually we made it out having had some laughs along the way.

My husband didn't know about it until we got there and was actually really up for it. The staff were really friendly and introduced us to the concept of the game (as we'd never done anything like this before). We were given some instructions and then shown to our \"escape room\". In all honesty we were completely thrown when we first started but slowly we started to get the hang of it. Our adrenaline was pumping and we really got into the game. We did have to ask for all three clues but we got there in the end and managed to complete the puzzle with 7 seconds to go! We were so impressed with the way it was all put together and the level of effort put into it. We are going to go back with a bigger group so that we can split up and compete against each other, this time we'll do the Mummy themed room."

I consider this game just about impossible to do, BUT the set is amazing and if they were to make the puzzles a bit easier, it could be a very good escape game. You enter what is probably one of the best sets that you will see in an escape room. All the Egyptian gold and pharoah stuff are brilliant. The format of the game is non linear, so everyone could concentrate on different tasks and different corners of the room. it does have two major drwbacks for me. Some of the puzzles are just about impossible to solve , just far too abstract and nowhere near logical enough. The other problem is a common pet hate of mine in escape games... WALKIE TALKIES. They seem to be used in games where the location of the room is inconvenient to hook up to tv monitors for communication between the players and the game controllers. The walkie talkie here was just rubbish and made communication quite a problem. All that said, you have to admire the set, and if they would just re think their idea of ridiculously abstract puzzles, they would have a brilliant game, in my opinion."

This is the first time I've experienced anything like it and I haven't stopped recommending it since. I just wish the establishment was bigger-with more rooms, so we could continue visiting. I am definitely going to give room 33 a go the next time I'm there. We were in the pharaoh's chamber this time and the puzzles, although hard, were very enjoyable. The one hour time limit was just enough to keep everyone interested! The people that work there are also very helpful and made the experience all the more enjoyable."

You definitely need 3 people for one of the puzzles, but the guys there are on a walkie talkie and will come in to help. The puzzles themselves ranged from basic to downright fiendish - but if you can think laterally as well as logically, it's quite easy to flow from one to the other. I'd definitely go back to do the other room they have as really enjoyed this - not sure my wife enjoyed it as much, but that was mainly due to me doing all the puzzles!

Technology oriented puzzles that just ruined the atmosphere. I cannot recommend the Pharaohs chamber at Escape Rooms. Especially avoid it if you are new to the exit game genre.

As we progressed, I felt almost overwhelmed by the amount of information and problems that were coming our way. We were able to solve some problems fairly quickly but there were a few things that ultimately we needed help with. There were only three of us so I feel we did quite well considering. Our guide offered us assistance from time to time which we were happy to accept. In the end we were out of there five minute after our one hour was up.

I have to say, that the staff are on hand to give advice and point out if you missed a clue, or as others mentioned, to offer help in solving some of the difficult puzzles (each room has about a dozen things you need to string together to win). These are all mental challenges, not physical, so you don't need to worry about hand-eye co-ordination or fitness, but you'll need your thinking-caps on!We found it very enjoyable, but it fits right into our comfort zone.

There was no music to help create an atmosphere as such, just a room with simple props. The staff were nice and when we struggling they try give us clues on the walkies talkies but it is so hard to hear what they are saying over the walkies talkies.I was hoping for an hour of fun filled laughter we had a decent time but after the experience I didn't hear my daughter wanting to have this as part of her birthday party agenda with her friends no more.The staff told us the other chamber of the Chinese theme has lasers and 2 rooms to explore, sounds more fun wish we had done that instead but that room max is 5 ppl only.The experience overall is okay but for the entertainment we got from it I thought was a little pricey."

There wasnt alot of clues and we all felt a little lost. Took quite awhile to understand what we were meant to be doing - even though we had outside help.We completed the game within the time given - through luck mostly!It's a fun experience, but with a few more tweaks, this will be awesome!"

The first challenge was actually finding the place as Tooley street seems to split so you have to be able to watch two forks at the same time. Once there we did the Pharoh puzzle. We did not do very well, although with generous help and a little extra time, we got out, but we had fun. We did not know exactly what to expect and wasted a lot of time at the beginning floundering. I liked some of the puzzles and thought some of them were just a bit too random and not likely to be solved without help, unless you were practiced at this type of thing. I only thought one of them was over the top though. I had hoped that the puzzles would allow a division of effort, but they rally do not and the quarters were too close for more than one or two people to work on the current puzzle. The only complaint I would make that I really think should be rectified is that only one of our group could understand the person who monitored us and gave us the clues, the walkie talkie quality was so bad. Having isolated the issues, I think it is a matter of expectations as much as anything, and I thought it was fun and will happily go back to try the other puzzle if I am back in London. We may also try some here in the US. If you like puzzles, this should be fun, but I think there is a bit of a learning curve, so i am really looking forward to a second go. "

We were allowed some additional time to try to solve them, before the lady came in to help us out and explain the final solution. The puzzles were all very different and quite clever. Without the hints, I am not sure we would have completed much more than one or two, but with some more adults in the group, I think we may have got there.We all had great fun - it was good to do something that we as adults enjoyed with the kids who had a ball.

We played the Pharaoh's Room and all five of us enjoyed the experience. It has a similar concept to all the others we have played but with some very unique and clever touches. I think the negative review is unfair as ALL the games have walkie talkies so you can communicate effectively. I'm not sure how badly they played the game or didn't understand the concept to be continually told they were doing the wrong thing... The whole point is that it is an escape game and you need to break clues and solve puzzles, so yes they are going to be cryptic otherwise what would be the point. We all worked out the \"cryptic\" clue given at the beginning within about 15mins into the game. As for the being \"cheap\", we were too engaged in the game to notice that everything was not shiny Ikea new and would not expect the \"treasure\" to actually BE treasure. It is challenging and you do have to think, work as a team and sometimes think outside of the box - this sometimes is not for everyone. If you always wanted to go on the Crystal Maze or the Krypton Factor and want to use your brain, challenge yourself and work as a team than I would recommend these types of games, including Escape Rooms' Pharaoh Chamber."

Perfect if you want a \"different\" afternoon or evening and a fun time actually \"doing something\" with friends rather than sitting in the cinema or going for dinner. Will be booking to go back to try the second room."

However if you're more into opening locks and exploring areas this one might not be for you. The team at escape rooms are very welcoming and friendly and the setup certainly looks the part with the rooms located in the basement. Without giving away what goes on inside room 33 a lot of the emphasis is on written puzzles and riddles rather than moving walls and building things. This didn't really suit our team but may work for yours. Can't really fault the production or personnel but room 33 didn't really do it for us."

I visited their 'egyptian' room with a group of friends. The d\u00e9cor is very impressive and to start off it took us a little while to figure out the objectives (part of the game, of course). Then as we worked our ways through the puzzles I was gobsmacked by the cleverly designed mechanisms. It was as if I was in a hollywood studio shooting the new national treasure!! As we approached towards the end of the game the puzzles became more and more fascinating until the final door opened. We had just a couple of minutes to spare and hand on heart it was the greatest fun I ever had in an hours time. Strongly recommend to all intellectual sorts and a great teambuilding experience.

Myself (white British male, 29 years old) went with 4 Chinese girls (all 23 years old) at 2100 on 17/09/2014 and did the pharaoh puzzle. The good:1. Easy to find, Central London Bridge location2. Friendly staff3. Interesting, challenging puzzle4. Fun photo at the endThe bad:1. Staff struggled to communicate with all of us. None of the girls understood the introduction story so I had to translate from slightly broken English. This is a shame as the story does add to and slightly aid the solution. 2. Maybe we're all just rubbish at puzzle games (totally possible) but we found it ridiculously hard. The language barrier between us definitely didn't help.3. One of the puzzles didn't work even though we were sure that we did it right. She showed us the solution and it worked so I guess we did something wrong but it seems to me that some puzzles are automated when solved and some have to be seen by the staff before they qualify. Just a slight weakness. Recommendation:I would definitely say give it a go, it's quite good fun and very frustrating, in a good way. Go with a mono language group so that everyone talks about all the clues in the same language, otherwise bits are sure to be lost. The game is exactly as you'd expect. Disclaimer: this is my first escape style game, so maybe with practise I'd improve."

This was our groups first experience of live escape room game, and we found it to have the right balance of challenge and fun. The location is very close to London Bridge tube station (about a 5 minute walk) so it was easy to find. When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly member of staff and sat in a modern waiting room. Everything was clearly explained to us and we were given a torch, pen/paper and a escape key (in case we wanted to leave as they do lock you in). There is an option to leave your belongings in a locker, however you can also take them into the room with you. After that we went down to the room which, initially was both a bit daunting and confusing, but once we had figured out what we were supposed to be doing, we really got into it! We didn't manage to complete it (although we were very close!) despite using all 3 of our clues up, so at the end they explain to you how to solve the problems you didn't complete. At the end we went back up to the main floor where a member of staff took a group photo of us and printed it out instantly, then stuck it on a piece of card so we could write messages on it, then this was put on the wall of the waiting room along with all the other photos/messages (of which there are already a lot!). He then emailed me (as I booked it) the group photo - which we thought was a nice touch.Overall - our group would strongly recommend this new attraction. It is suitable for all ages and loads of fun!

The underground setting is amazing, the game is well themed with some really clever moments and fun puzzles. Where this room excels is the immersion in being a codebreaker - if you're at all interested in how people broke codes during the war then I think this is going to really impress you. There is one puzzle in the game that, while highly thematic, could be a bit frustrating (or, if you look at it differently, totally authentic). If you're the sort of person that loses patience easily then be warned!Full disclosure: we were given complimentary tickets."

The stand-out aspect for me was the location and decor - the owners have gone all out on creating an authentic wartime atmosphere. The wartime theme of the puzzles was fun too.I think we as computer science nerds found some of the puzzles perhaps a little too straightforward and for a team of 6 it felt a bit cramped. This might be due to the linear nature of some of the puzzles (you have to solve one thing before you can move on to the next) meaning we weren't able to break into smaller teams and work on different tasks in parallel. But all the teams still came back with enthusiastic feedback.The nicest part was having a drink with the owners at the end and talking through our experience :) Thanks for the fun evenings!"

I'm a massive fan of room escapes, having been to around 25 different ones now, and I'm also a bit of a geek when it comes to disused tube stations, so I had to try this!After playing, I have to say that it exceeded my expectations and is one of the very best I've played. A lot of things that have frustrated me about other room escapes, they have got right here.Here's some of the things that make it so great:- the unique selling point of Mission Breakout is its amazing location. This gives it a thoroughly immersive and authentically historical feeling that sets the mood throughout the whole game. A pre-game introductory video featuring a winston Churchill lookalike really helped add to the effect.- great use of tech and machinery that both fit in very nicely with the theme and story but also made the puzzles very fun and original. The lighting and sound effects add to the atmosphere and drama.- the puzzles were for the most part logical and solvable (not too easy though) and followed on nicely from eachother. All the clues needed were present in the room, so in hindsight none of the solutions seemed too random to get. A series of colour coded lights helped to guide you through the puzzles in the right order and I thought this was a brilliant touch that I haven't seen elsewhere.- a couple of the puzzles were very satisfying and genius and had very unexpected and cool results when solved.- a clue giving system is always handy for when a team gets stuck, and that feature was present here. Tick!- although not in character, the staff were very friendly and welcoming and I was impressed how they took the time afterwards to talk to us about the company, their plans for a 2nd game, and also gave us some complimentary drinks.My only criticism, something easily fixed, is that there was one puzzle that required us to be able to pick out some black coloured-coded wheels, amongst other colours. Not only was it not obvious that we had to do that, but unfortunately under the dim lights, the black edges looked like more of a grey or silver. So we failed to solve that puzzle even when being told by a clue to look at the black wheels, which led to us wasting quite a lot of time on that puzzle, and so failing to complete the whole game for quite a frustrating reason. I would recommend using blacker paint to make those wheels look even more black, or even better, choose a different colour instead for the ones that must be used - such as red which was a lot easier to pick out.In summary, this is well worth a visit and throughly recommended for anyone who likes puzzles, room escapes, and London Underground history! In such a great venue, it would have been a shame if the game creators has wasted the opportunity by putting together a poorly designed game. Luckily they've done a fantastic job!"

Well-thought-out puzzles and an impressive array of props made the game quite interesting and kept us engaged, and the location in a disused tube station was perfect for the WWII theme! The staff was very nice and kind, and after the game answered all our questions about the game and the venue. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes this sort of puzzle games! It's not as claustrophobic as it sounds (apparently the tube station was used as a bomb shelter!) but it can get a bit stressful at times! Good teamwork a must :)"

Myself and a group of friends visited Mission: Breakout last weekend and have an amazing time!Upon entering the tube station, it already feels epic, walking down a long windy staircase into the unknown, upon entering we were met by the lovely guys running the game which was a nice welcome, some people may be a little nervous before entering the game and the friendly staff help settle nerves, have a little chat and get you ready for the game. We then entered the room which was really immersive! No spoilers but there's so many amazing hidden gems and events! The 60 minutes goes very quick and the game is a great balance of difficulty and you'll be working out clues, operating machines and codebreaking the whole time! It's great fun!Once the game is finished and you've hopefully escaped, you have a little time to chill out with a free drink and reflect on the game!I'm quite selective with recommendations to friends but can happily say I've recommended Mission: Breakout to everyone I've spoken to since.They're a relatively new breakout game but have definitely come in with a bang and I'm sure we'll be seeing many more great things from them soon!

I've done many escape rooms, but this is the first I felt compelled to review as it was really something special.Of the pure escape room games I've done, this is by far the best I've been to in terms of being wonderfully themed and very immersive. They use the old tube abandoned Tube station brilliantly and as a Tube geek I loved that alone.But they didn't stop there, they mixed it with amazing sets that feel like they're out of a movie. Indeed those that have seen The Imitation Game will certainly get a blast from some of the elements. The quality was superb.It's nice to see them mix in things like sound effects too, which I've not seen exploited in escape rooms and really adds to the theme.Add to that, they were very friendly, chatted afterwards and gave us a cold drink as we discussed our experiences.All in all, highly recommended. It's lovely to see a piece of history resurrected - and at this level of quality they've set the bar to which all other escape rooms need to meet."

Keep that in mind when reading the negative points since even though it might not have been the best, we still all enjoyed it very much and is definitely worth going to, be it only for the location.The good:- Great historical location! It felt like sharing a bit of London history, I loved it.- The atmosphere is definitely there, the setting is quite realistic for this kind of budget.- Most puzzles are of good quality.The less good:- Some puzzles require guessing or trying until it works. I wish there were more clues to find which would lead to the path to follow. But maybe that's personal.- Some of the equipment was not so pleasant to touch... Can't really say what without spoiling some of it. It's not the cleanest space overall.- Not everything is automated, which can lead to some unexplained behaviours."

The most eye-catching feature of this escape room is its unique location in the catacombs under the disused South Kentish Town tube station, which closed in 1924 and was used as an air-raid shelter in the Second World War. The escape room is set in that time, complete with an introduction video by Winston Churchill and lots of machinery in the room that resembles technology from the time used to decipher the Nazi codes. The venue's first room, \"Codebreakers\", stays true to its name and makes you operate the machinery and crack codes.As a relatively experienced team of four we felt that the total amount of puzzles was a bit low (we needed 43 minutes to escape), but their quality was on a good level and, especially with the very strong theme in the unique location, a big recommendation and very good value for money."

Our game master was slightly delayed, so we were joint with a different group doing a different room who have never done any escape games before. So we had to go through all the basics, which did spoil the experience a bit. The room itself is great and there is a twist to it. There are variety of puzzles which are not just based on the padlocks. Always a plus. We escaped with 6 seconds to spare!!!! However, at one point you need to go through lots of written information, which we discarded as a red herring. Unfortunately, it broke the flow of the game and we didn't come out of the game thinking \"Oh Wow, the final puzzle is amazing\".

            "review": "Excellent puzzles, not quite the total experience. (No Spoilers about the rooms)We've done two of the rooms now, Joker's Asylum and The Penitentiary. On the plus side, the rooms are laid out really well with a good variety of puzzles. Joker's Asylum lived up to its 5-star difficulty setting, while we completed The Penitentiary in 45 minutes with one hint so probably around 3-star difficulty. The lighting and technology are also very effective, something I've not really seen in other Escape The Room games except ClueQuest. It allowed for more unusual puzzles and this alone makes it stand out from the others.However, I would still rank it below ClueQuest for one reason - the total experience. It's not enough just doing the puzzles and escaping, you need a build-up of expectation before you enter and a debrief after, like a good dessert! ClueQuest did this really well, both before (the \"briefing\") and after - it gave what you did in the room some context.Omescape doesn't do this nearly as effectively. At the beginning there is a briefing but the staff didn't seem that interested (maybe they should hire an actor?) and at the end it's worse, there is no reference to what you've just done or what you've just escaped from. It feels a bit like being a cow - you've been milked, now off you go...I think once they've changed that aspect, it will elevate it to the next level."

For our group, three had never done an escape room before and two had only done one. The experience was great! The puzzles are challenging, the design good and whole concept kept you wanting more. The staff were very friendly and made your experience feel personal and not just another booking for them. We managed to escape the room in 29 minutes, the fastest it's ever been done!! So shocked!!! No idea how we were so fast!Would 100% recommended and will be back to try the other two!! "

            "review": "Excellent way to spend an hour.. Firstly I should say that I am quite an experienced Escape Room player, having played around 20 rooms in London, and so my ratings tend to seem on the harsh side, as I am comparing against other rooms I have played. This review is just for Omescape\u2019s \u201cBiohazard Laboratory\u201d game, as I haven\u2019t played the other two yet.People new to rooms escapes will definitely have a very fun time here (Biohazard Laboratory is actually a very good choice of room to introduce you to the genre), and escape room enthusiasts will too, but I\u2019ll explain a few of the things which let it down a bit. With some improvements and tweaks made, this could definitely be a really good one.Firstly, THINGS I LIKED:- Very friendly host. Though not in character (which is rare but always gets bonus points from me), he was welcoming and explained everything properly without waffling on too long. The waiting area was nice, and had some puzzles to play with while we waited.- We didn\u2019t have a booking, my brother and I rang on an impromptu whim, and were fitted in without any bother as they had a space available for us.- Some great theming and design inside the game, particularly the first two parts which were like a sewer. I won\u2019t give any spoilers but the use of lighting and darkness added a memorable mood that I haven\u2019t experienced in any other room escapes. The 2nd room looked especially cool.- Some unique sorts of puzzles. Throughout the whole game there was not one key needed to open a padlock! That made a nice change.- Some genuinely lovely uses of technology for puzzles. A lot of love and effort had obviously gone into that.- I liked that we were able to get clues whenever we wanted, and that the penalty for this would be not being included in the \u201cused no clues\u201d leaderboard. This meant that although some parts baffled us, we never got frustratingly stuck for too long \u2013 it was fun throughout.THINGS I WASN\u2019T SO KEEN ON:- Some of the set design was a bit rough and ready in places. There were a few times where screws and wires were visible, or where a name plate had come unstuck from the surface it was supposed to be attached to (in the last room). There was also a hole in the wall with what looked like a cog inside. We were sure we\u2019d have to stick something in there and turn it and were disappointed when that never happened\u2026 it was just a misleading hole. I would recommend covering that up with something.- One puzzle was a bit mathsy and complex, and another really looked like it was but actually wasn\u2019t (in the 2nd room). I loved the actual solution to it, and feel it should have had one more tiny clue promting towards that, as it would have saved us 5 minutes of trying out unnecessary maths-based solutions.- Also, some dials which needed to be set (near the beginning) did not have arrow markers on them as you\u2019d expect, so some black lines had been scruffily drawn on with felt tip pen. Unfortunately these had faded and in a couple of cases were barely visible, especially in the dim lighting conditions. As these are absolutely pivotal to completing the puzzle, I think this should be fixed, with a neater and more permanent arrow /marker on the dials. For aesthetics, but more importantly for function.- We only got one torch between two of us. A torch each would have been much better, as they were most definitely needed.- One of the pieces of technology near the end wasn\u2019t working and got skipped. Even though the host afterwards said this wasn\u2019t a pivotal part of the game, it looked very intriguing.- While some puzzles were really nice, there were a few that I think felt a bit too random and relied on guesswork and overstretched leaps of logic. Even in hindsight, the answer didn\u2019t seem obviously right, it\u2019s just what happened to work. This is always a bit frustrating and leaves me feeling like \"oh... ok...\". I prefer it when there\u2019s a clear and logical process through the whole thing \u2013 I usually feel any gaps in this could often be helped by adding a few more subtle clues and instructions. For example how to use the metal object that you need for the last puzzle\u2026 the way it had to be used wasn\u2019t intuitive and had to be explained to us over the walkie talkie. A little in-room instruction about things like that would have been nice. Also some of the information needed for that last puzzle, (which in itself was a bit elaborate and convoluted), was a bit too buried amongst a lot of scientific jargon, so the whole thing felt a bit wishy-washy. I would probably recommend cutting down on some of the unneeded text for that last puzzle and being more explicit about the aim.- One puzzle involved some picture symbols. Without giving too much away, in our opinion these didn\u2019t really look like what they were supposed to and so for us it felt very much like guesswork. It didn\u2019t help that the last one had accidentally been rotated so it was upside down, completely changing our interpretation of it. I would recommend completely redoing these symbols, making it more clear what they\u2019re supposed to represent. I think the puzzle would still be challenging because you\u2019d still have to work out how to use them, but at least when somebody solves what they have to do, they would then be able to go ahead and do it without being unsure or getting extra hints. In summary, it was a solid game, very enjoyable, and would be even moreso for newer players. However, the mostly excellent design work was let down a little bit in places, by some parts that were a bit sloppy or not working as they should. And a few of the puzzles whose solutions felt a bit too arbitrary and obscure (even in hindsight) led to us asking for more clues than we would have liked. I have played other rooms in London that have really nailed these elements (very slickly produced and always having satisfying, logical solutions; all the clues you need are already there in the room) but I have also played much worse rooms too, so the 3 out of 5 stars seemed most appropriate. With some of the improvements mentioned above, it would definitely jump to 4 stars. I look forward to going back and trying the other two rooms :) Thanks very much for a fun afternoon."

This is the intermediate level game and pretty tricky, you will be given a walkie talkie, pen and paper and a flashlight as your tools to solve the puzzles and riddles. If you get stuck you will get some clues from the game masters who will talk to you through the walkie talkie, these will be subtle hints rather than revealing what the solution is. You'll have 60 minutes to break out of the room. I have given this 3 stars as we managed to 'accidently' solve certain clues before the clues we needed to solve before these ones which meant we got instructions through the walkie talkie to ignore the clue for now etc. We didn't make it out on time but the game master made us go back in to finish the game even though we were pretty much ready to head back out, this kind of ruining the experience."

Rooms itself are filled with riddles and each game leaves your brain steaming (even the difficulty 3 gives you a lot of pleasure). Plus you get all the excitement running against the clock.

            "review": "Biohazard - our third game with Omescape. We had played two other games from Omescape previously - one in NY and Penintentiary in London. Each member of our team played minimum 10 other escape rooms.This review describes our experience playing Biohazard game. Positives:- really cool location - escape rooms are inside a former church and there is very spacious reception area, which is cool if you come a little earlier for your game- very nice design, consistently sticking to the theme- sophisticated puzzles using some very cool technology (although one of them didn't work properly)Negatives:- We only got two torches (team of 4) in what is very dark escape room (especially in some of its parts). I'm not sure whether this was supposed to make us work in 'couples' and to promote team work, or increase atmosphere, but only effect it had was that it was super frustrating. - One part of one puzzle was missing, because one of the previous teams has lost it. Seriously? - Game masters' attention was very inconsistent. They wouldn't let us know when we were obviously looking for the last \"missing picture\", and when we later in the game asked for a hint, we had to contact them several times, and try flashing the light on cameras to get their attention. However when I tried to get something out of big \"aquarium\", without using any special strength, to make sure there is nothing hidden inside, i was immediately told off for trying to take the room apart. (if you don't want players to do something in your game, mark it with a sticker, or don't make it that easy)Overall i think Penintentiary was a better game, but a lot could have been influenced by having different (or less busy) game masters."

But that's what they're there for, to nudge you in the right direction, giving us just enough without taking the fun out of the challenged. Overall a good experience, although I would suggest the beginners rooms if you've never done anything like this before!"

We were absolutely pitiful but enjoyed it nevertheless. The high production value is what stands out I think for Omescape compared to other escape games I've done - there are multiple rooms, huge range of props and lighting/sound effects etc. You're not just locked up in a converted apartment filled with a bunch of cheap props and low lighting, given a rough backstory for the puzzle and told to escape. Instead you're making your way through multiple film sets it almost feels like, and the puzzles often involve doing a lot more than just finding a key/unlocking a box - be warned! Can't wait to try out their other two games!"

Two of the four in our group had never been to an escape room. My boyfriend and I were the two inexperienced ones which added to the fun of it all. We were asked to go 10 minutes before our booked time. We did the Bio hazardous lab room. We had Nicky as our team leader who explained the goal of the game and a little back story. He was very welcoming and friendly! We had an hour to enter four separate rooms and solve a variety of tasks. All of these tasks were different puzzles which was great because each person in the group had a chance to shine and help get to the end goal! We got out with 13 minutes to spare and received a medal! It was a great adrenaline rush and we were all very excited about the situation. We 100% plan to go back but maybe with a bit more practise since the next rooms are trickier! Overall a great time!"

I'd recommend this room to people who've not to been to a game before, but also to more experienced gamers as there were things I've never seen before.The operation could be a little slicker, and we weren't shown into our room until about 15 minutes after the time it was booked for, but that wasn't really a problem."

The only reason we're giving it 4 instead of 5 was because one of the helpers literally came into our room to give a hint at something. It was an appreciated hint but it ruined the 'locked in' theme.

The whole set up is friendly but slick and professional. Joker's asylum was my favourite of the rooms - not only was it the hardest of the three, the group dynamic at the start was completely different from anything I've had at other rooms and really added a new style of challenge.As a slight caveat, there's nothing absolutely outstanding in here (by escape room standards) - the sort of thing that leaves you buzzing and talking about it for days afterwards - but rooms like that are rare indeed and it's not reasonable to hold every room to that bar! To have built three rooms of this quality is a great achievement and well worthy of 5 stars!"

This one, the Joker's Asylum, had a new twist which we hadn't found in other games and although I was nervous about this element taking some of the 'team play' out of the game, it actually worked well and made us use our communication skills in a very different way. As always with these games the puzzles are clever and there are some nice little surprises that kept even us hardened gamers amused. We made it out with 10 mins to spare which suggests that maybe the more experienced gamers will find it easier than normal but even so we were told there was only a 20% success rate. I always prefer games where clues/hints are offered via screens rather than needing to ask for them via walkie talkie but our guide intervened once or twice when we needed a small steer. Great fun as usual but I wouldn't recommend the Asylum game for complete beginners! Will probably return to do the other games sometime soon."

Made it difficult to communicate and probably been much easier if we'd just phoned each other up on our mobiles to communicate!Their were some nice puzzles in there but there were several that were just a bit weird. I'll not spoil it but on the last big one there was one that required a LOT of piecing together and another just reading a word.

We were not disappointed, it was a game full of wonderful discoveries including some great moments of teamwork and also some great personal victories, which culminated in our escape with 30 seconds to spare. I would certainly not recommend this particular room to first timers (beginners should definitely try one of their other rooms instead), but for teams with experience 'Joker's Asylum' is a must play.

Don't let that put you off. The puzzles in the room are extremely well put together. A potential downside of the Joker room is that you are split into 2 teams working together but in separate rooms.

            "review": "Lengthy review alert!. Wow, I have to say that the \"Breakout\" game at Enigma Escape really exceeded my expectations. I have quite a bit of experience with escape rooms - think I've done about 25 now.I always enjoy them but quite a lot of them frustrate me when the puzzle answers are too random and don't really follow a very satisfying logic. So I was excited when I read that Enigma Escape pride themselves on a more realistic style of room escape. They claimed that the games are solved more through thinking \"what would I actually do in this situation?\" and solving clues to do with the story. Rather than, say, a random ball maze or wooden block puzzle (as fun as those are), or an arbitrary maths puzzle (less fun.)I have to say that 'Breakout' really lived up to this claim. The puzzles were all fully integrated into the plot and the 'world' of the game, and not once left me frustratedly thinking \"really?!\" after I'd found out an answer. I love how a storyline with characters started to emerge. This element was better than I've seen in any other escape room.The theming / set design was also very strong and technology used in a slick way. Nothing was broken - everything worked smoothly. Hints were delivered when needed via a screen - my favourite method I've seen in escape rooms. Much better than a walkie talkie. I like how there weren't loads of red herrings and unnecessary props around. And the woman who hosted was very friendly, chatty and delivered it all brilliantly. Top marks there.Not quite the best escape room I've played, but definitely in the top 5. There weren't really any amazingly clever or ingeniously original puzzles that made me go \"wow\", but it was great for the other reasons mentioned above. Those elements are harder to get right, and so made this one really stand out.I'd like to give just a few ideas for improvements to make it even better, hopefully without giving too much away:- the bit of information the host gave to us in the introduction, regarding a secret something to be used on one of the doors. I think it would be more satisfying to discover that info during the game, perhaps on a piece of paper with an accompanying diagram / instructions.- The thing in the last room using the contents of the crates. I think there's a missed opportunity for making that into more of a puzzle. Perhaps specific holes need to be connected, and certain ones need to be left empty. Again there could be a clue somewhere with a diagram to help solve it. If the overall game is lacking anything, I think it's a really nice juicy physical puzzle like that, one that doesn't involve keys, codes and numbers. That last room is a perfect place for it - it's almost there. Trying to keep it within the realism of the game would be tricky, but definitely doable.- Perhaps have some kind of colour / symbol coding to help find which keys go where throughout the game, as that seemed like mostly guesswork.- I really liked the puzzle for the first door code, but I think it should be made clearer that the sheet is from last week and the \"invitation\" is for the following week. This seemed like a bit of a guess rather than definitely right, but it would be good if it felt definitely right once you've worked it out, especially because you've only got a few attempts on the keypad before it freezes.In summary, I thoroughly recommend this for beginners (for two of my team this was their first room escape, and they loved it) but equally, a unique and refreshing angle on the genre for more experienced players.We can't wait to go back and play their other game \"the killer\""

Excellent idea for a team building activity or just something different to do with friends/family too.Our host was great, very friendly and even provided light snacks which was nice.Every element was well thought out from the moment we arrived to when we left the building - and yes we completed it in time.The puzzles and room layout were cleverly put together. I thought there were going to be a lot of mind boggling wordy-riddles, although I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it was so much better than that, there were a lot of props to get involved with. The whole experience was full of laughter, excitement and nervousness. We all thoroughly enjoyed it so if you're thinking to do an escape game, book this one! We'll definitely be back to try the next game."

The game itself is fully immersive and you can throw yourself into it or sit back and think. Your approach is up to you but the race is on. Hints are given when needed but not too quickly or regularly, the puzzles are challenging but not impossible and the whole set up works very well. There is a good story and effort has been made from start to finish. My wife did it with me and although not her sort of thing she loved it too.

The hour flew by, and we left wanting to do another one straight away. Hon, our host, was great fun and made the experience run smoothly. He ensured we understood how the experience worked, and gave us lots of encouragement beforehand. Hon warned us that it is a bit more difficult as a pair, rather than a larger group, but we managed to escape with a few minutes to spare. The whole experience was fab, and if anyone is looking to try an escape room, be it for the first time, or to tick off another, I urge you to book Enigma!! It will not disappoint!! 10/10, exceeded our expectations by far!!!"

A bit of common sense and some (slight) physicality sees you through into the main part of the game where the story slowly progresses as you logically work your way through the game.What we love about this room is that everything makes total sense, there's no abstract puzzles that are out of place with the setting and the environment feels totally realistic.There's also a lot of care given to the story, you're not just unlocking padlocks to find more puzzles, with each step you are actually learning more about what's going on.And whilst it isn't a 'scary' attraction as such (no live actors), there are two moments that made us jump!We'd definitely recommend this to anyone - smaller groups would probably work best given the linear nature of the game."

Involved more logical thinking than other escape rooms and they would do well to build on that an continue in that direction. In terms of difficulty I would call it medium and I'd encourage them to make their next room much trickier! We got a medal and pin for winning though and they even gave us water and snacks which was really nice, David who was running it was really friendly."

It's a real challenge to work out the clues but you're being monitored by camera (you don't even notice this) as you're doing it so the team behind it can provide you with specific clues to help move you on if you get stuck. We really appreciated this as it means that the level of challenge is always pitched well to your needs and gives you a good chance of completing it in the hour. I'd say it was good value for money given how much we enjoyed it - we'd definitely play any other game they came out with!"

I can't give detail without spoilers so I will say there are physical and mental puzzles to make your way to your escape. They have groups from 3 to 5 so the 3 of us had our own room. A clock counts down the hour you have to escape and definitely heightens the tension! Staff was enthusiast and gave some clues along the way if we got stuck. Our teenage daughter loved it as much as we did and an hour went by so fast! I would recommend this to everyone!"

After the experience Ada congratulated us on completing the challenge and we had our photo taken, props provided!

It was compact, with a good story that you could follow, not too many red herrings, and fairly linear (fun!) puzzling. It also had a great physical element, that made you feel so completely a part of the story, and was quite unlike any other room escape we've done. Plus there were some great touches - popcorn, a little intro animation and prizes for getting out. Excellent work!"

The option of hints is available, but we found this a little easier than some we've done, and didn't need many.If pushed for criticism, I'd say this is advertised as themed to do with films and the cinema, but had pretty much nothing to do with them other that the opening video. It doesn't take away from the experience at all though, and I'd happily recommend this to anyone keen for an adventure."

Multiple rooms provide new challenges with plenty of twists and turns. Very addictive! Will recommend to all my friends and looking forward to the new story."

After seeing something like this on Big Band Theory, I was well up for it. Finally convinced the other half, got some other friends involved and off we went. From start to finish it was brilliant! Cleverly done, good little back story too that makes you really feel part of it. David, the host, was great too - very helpful and knowledgable. Highly recommend, there was three of us (two couples) and it was a blast."

Our host during the game was really nice, ready to answer any of our questions (before the game of course), we received some small snacks, and even though both of us spoke french between us during the game we still received useful and perfectly timed hints! What I liked the most is that these hints weren't too simple to make the game less challenging and not too hard to discourage us. If you want to take a break from visiting tourist spots all day and do something out of the ordinary, this is a perfect and fun way to spend your free time!Maybe just one suggestion, even though the game in it self was very interesting and realistic, the story could be a little bit more elaborate to try to connect us more to the main characters, explain why we were imprisoned.But again this is just a suggestion, we still loved it and will definitely recommend it to our families and friends!"

            "review": "Brilliant fun, mentally challenging and great value for money. I booked this for my friends's 40th birthday for 4 of us. None of us had tried an escape game before so were intrigued...The basic premise is you have 1hr locked inside a puzzle game and need to solve a range of challenges to escape. You start in a small room in total darkness and have to think on your feet to work out where you are, why you're there and what to do next. Each time you solve a challenge, a new one presents itself. Some of the challenges are obvious e.g. needing to unlock a padlock. Others are more cerebral, requiring lateral thinking and close team work. What's great about the experience is that you work as a team and each person contributes a different way of problem solving to help complete the game.All the time there's a countdown timer on a screen on the wall, which increases the pressure as you get closer to zero. It adds excitement as your competitive edge kicks in and doesn't want to lose! We got stuck on one particular challenge for about 10mins before solving the riddle, which meant a race to get out in time. We scraped through with 1m42s left on the clock.I'd highly recommend this. It's something different, it forces you to use your brain and work as a team and you don't know what's next, so there's plenty of suspense and surprise. Well run and incredibly friendly staff. The only thing missing for me was the lack of real character interaction - that would take it to the next level."

Played the Killer with 3 other friends, which IMO was the optimum number of players as anymore would be too crowded in the rooms and information in the game would be rather scattered amongst ourselves which can lead to confusion if teamwork isn't the strength of a group.We were greeted by the lovely Ada and was very professional (in a fun way) and briefed us everything we needed to know.The theme and story was great!Comparing this game to a few I've played, this requires more physical interaction, which felt more fun and had a sense of realism to the storyline.Overall, I would definitely recommend anyone who has never tried an escape room experience to play the Killer as the difficulty is not too hard but not too easy or as Goldilock's puts it: \"just right\".P.s. They give FREEBIES!!!"

It is immersive and you are drawn in. We really enjoyed that you start (as you would in this particular plot) in a room with absolutely nothing.The puzzles are well presented and logical - with a good mix to challenge different skills sets.The production values are well conceived and overall the experience is very good value for money.We look forward to when the next room opens, and would certainly recommend this escape to new players, as well as small groups of experienced players!"

Have completed a escape game before each are so different this was challenging with a great story that evolved each time you solved a puzzle. Hon was great very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend this as a different experience to do whilst in London. Looking forward to the new game that will be realised soon. Keep up the good work."

We've done several escape rooms and usually have <5 mins left (we are a group of 2) but we had almost 12 mins left. It felt like more puzzles were needed. Some of the puzzles were different to ones we've seen before and it was a nice touch with the coins/badges. Hon was friendly and is very passionate. If you've done other escape rooms, this ones concept is really good but not as challenging as others. "

Having already played at least 4-5 other escape games in London and elsewhere in the past, this was definitely the most enjoyable one.

I have to say that I cannot agree more!! My family and I enjoyed every minute of the mind-altering experience....can't say much because of course, I don't want to give it away. We were a group of 5; all well-educated and still took almost the whole time to escape the room! While the others in my group hadn't done anything like this, I had...and I still was mind-blown at the challenges.I'd recommend this activity to anyone in London...especially visitors looking to do something more and different than the typical tourist-y things. Also, easy to find with the instructions given...We caught the tube and walked the rest of the way; didn't take long at all.Can't forget that Hon was awesome!!! :)"

I would definitely recommend this, and may even consider going for his next escape enigma it was that good! Hats off to Sam!"

I went for my birthday, with my husband and 2 children, aged 20 and 15. Its a really good and totally immersive experience and I was so pleased that we managed to solve it. Really good for teamwork... I am really looking forward to the second room opening later this year, hopefully.

All puzzles were exceptionally designed and very unique, and were never too easy to solve. The rooms themselves were very creatively themed and there were many surprises along the way. Enigma Escape is certainly a must if you are an escape room enthusiast or even just a beginner, and being a 15 year old, I was immediately craving another one! I will certainly be returning when their next room is finally completed, hopefully with the same host as he was very enthusiastic and certainly established a perfect atmosphere for the whole experience, somehow making it even more enjoyable.

We've never done any escape games but I'm pleased with the choice out of all that are around London! Does test your nerves and patience but the clues and the idea of everything was just beyond imaginable! Very clever and very well thought up! Can't wait to return for the next escape! Also enjoyed receiving a medal at the end! Thanks hon!"

Really looking forward to the next room hopefully coming soon."

There was also a with logical sense behind each puzzle and no parts felt forced. We completed the challenge as a two but the room was big enough to cater to larger teams. Hon was our host and he was a really friendly chap who was happy to talk to us after the challenge and explain how we did and where else we could go.

It definitely didn't disappoint! I had a good idea of what kind of stuff to expect from the game as I have played the online versions, and I also watched the video on the website. (HINT: If you want to go in completely blind I would advise NOT watching the video on the website before playing this game; it was helpful to get an idea of what the game would be like but it did contain some spoilers). The game was a good level of difficulty - challenging but when you felt like you were stuck you had the option of helpful hints on the screen. It was very hands on and there was a good variety of puzzles to solve. We made it out with 3 mins to spare, and when we finally burst through the exit door our adrenaline was really pumping! We can't wait to try another escape game and will definitely be back when the new Enigma Escape game opens in a few months.Hannah and Gary"

A couple of very minor slips stop it from getting a perfect score.* The backstory is told through an overlong and not very informative animation if you haven't read the story on the website* WHY do you only have 1 hour to escape? (perhaps add \"live CCTV footage\" to the countdown clock?)* A small slip in internal logic near the very endThese things only affect the \"immersive\" quality of the experience and don't detract from the escape itself.

If you're looking for a fun afternoon out with friends or even just as a couple -- Engima Escape is it!

You feel like you're in a movie, solving a crime and catching the killers. Hon, our host, was very welcoming right off the bat. The room and waiting area is clean and well maintained. Enigma Escape goes that extra mile to make you feel like you're getting a real experience -- not just locking you in a room. The puzzles are challenging but rewarding, and they're logical and based on a cool story you can actually follow. This is one of the best escape rooms we've ever done! Cannot wait until they open a second room. We'll definitely be back.NOTE: This room has some MILDLY scary bits, so it's not for young children. 18+ only!"

We did the escape room as a pair which worked very well as we were both kept busy the whole time. It was a good mix of physical tasks and mental problem solving and very well themed. It flowed in a good logical order and we managed to escape with 7 mins to spare. I would highly recommend Enigma Escapes for anyone looking to do an exciting (tiny bit scary in parts) escape room.

My wife and I had a rough idea what to expect but it was our first time in any kind of escape game and we thought we'd try it on our trip to London.We had a lot of fun trying to solve the clues and did pretty well. We managed about 3/4 of the game in the hour time limit but, without giving too much away, we were stumped by a piece of electronic equipment which we had never used before (in other words a certain level of tech savviness is needed to successfully complete the latter part of the game).Overall it was great fun and the clues were well timed and helped point our thinking in the right direction.If this company were to create another game, we would have no hesitation in trying that one too next time we come to London."

The game is so well thought out and logical, with no random puzzle solving - it all makes complete sense within the storyline. I did feel it was a little easy compared to the ones I've done before - but not everyone gets out so maybe my team were just exceptionally brilliant (combined with our experience giving us a bit more of a heads up in how to start tackling it)!

They didn't tell you what to do, instead they act as a prompt to change your way of thinking. It felt great working together as some people tried to work out clues and others explored to see what they could find.Cannot recommend this enough, this was our first time trying this type of activity and we'll definitely do it again! Also for anyone concerned, the room size is not too claustrophobic. My friend managed it and they struggle with small rooms, so please don't let that put you off if you're worried about it!Hon is clearly very passionate about this project and he really makes it special, thanks for a great time!"

For someone who has done escape rooms before though (and without giving anything away for people that are new to this type of game) I felt it was a bit easy given it's length and could benefit from another stage. Something that set this game apart from others was the little additions of medals, snacks etc. A nice touch and feels less like you're just being shunted through an obstacle course for your money.

Hon treated us to popcorn and drinks while he explained the rules and showed us a video. No spoilers, but it would be a bit spooky for kids under 15. My 13 year old son handled it well, but not all will - you be the judge. Thanks to Hon for allowing our son to join in! The puzzles and clues are really well done and not easy. The hints don't give away any answers, just redirect your efforts. We were successful in escaping, but with only 38 seconds left. What a feeling! This is a great way to see how you family can work together. All minds are necessary. Great adrenaline rushes - one after another as you move through the experience. AWESOME!"

After I had heard about an Escape the Room game colleagues of mine had done in New York City, I went online and search for a similar experience here in London. I came across a review by \"Time Out\" which recommended Enigma Escape and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we did! This was our first escaping adventure and we didn't really know what to expect. Sam introduced himself as the host and during an initial 10mins of chatting and getting ready for the experience he told us that he was also the owner and had founded Enigma Escape just 5 months ago. Sam then proceeded to present the game to us in parts by a short video. After that the door opened and the 60mins clock started ticking... The game itself (without giving away any details) is amazingly well designed. It is called \u201cThe Killer\u201d and will have you thinking, wondering and puzzle solving every second of it. Sam is always \u201cthere\u201d (via surveillance cameras and a text message screen to interact with you) to give you a hint should you be in need of one. The riddles are neither impossible nor straightforward to solve. In fact they are extremely well thought out and you will have a blast working your way through them. We made it out with 8mins left on the clock and felt proud and excited. Enigma Escape is worth every penny and we couldn\u2019t recommend it more highly. Sam said he's currently planning a second room. Count on us to come back for another amazing challenge!"

After a few months of really wanting to do an escape the room experience me and my good friend decided to take the leap - we were extremely excited and a little worried (only for a good reason!) We found Enigma on here and we're very grateful it was a 2 person one as most if not all the others are for 3+. We got there after a nice morning in London and were a little late and were sad and anxious we may not get to play but on arrival the wonderful host, Hon, said we were very lucky and allowed a to still play as there were no more games that day! So thank you Hon! After giving us a lovely welcome and cozy introduction to what lay ahead we settled down with some nice snacks for our experience, then all of a sudden thrown in to the room (metaphorically! I know it's called the Killer but Hon graciously showed us in.) Once we we delved in we were immediately immersed into the narrative and the room itself; scrambling around for a way out of the first section we needed a few hints but made it and were so thrilled and were into the next bit! Our host let us know beforehand that this is one of (if not the only) escape experience that follows a narrative and I'm so glad it was our first! I don't want to reveal anything more for the sake of any other fellow escapees, but I will say do it! Do it! Do it! Worth every single penny and more! And the ending, wow. Thank you Hon and all the creators for this great experience! Will definitely be coming back for the new room next year! Trust me. Go and escape!"

The hospitality of the host immediately put us all at ease and the simplicity of the introduction left us feeling both intrigued and anxious - a perfect combination to get our adrenaline pumping! The codes/tasks weren't too easy but were achievable and the handy hints that came up throughout the game kept us focused and pointed us in the right direction if we were losing our way a bit. We did the game as a group of 4 which I think worked perfectly - I wouldn't suggest any more players for this game. When we managed to escape at the end we were all so excited but also sad that the experience was over! Well worth the money, lots of fun and we are already planning to come again when a new room has opened with a different scenario! I also plan to purchase gift vouchers for my sister and friend! The only thing I would say is that I'm glad I didn't view the video on the website before I came as it is much more fun not knowing what to expect!"

Hon was a great host, building up the experience and getting us going. The challenges were great, the right level of difficult without being too much so. Where we started to lose track, a hint was always there in a timely fashion. The hints themselves though were just that, hints not sledgehammers.All in all, a great diversion.

A great experience, however with just the two of us it was a bit trickier so it would have been good to have a few more hints, we were so close to escaping but failed on the very last part as it was too confusing! The story line is cool, I look forward to seeing the next one they bring out."

Location is good and easy to find just off of Holloway tube station. The greeting was warm and pleasant with plenty of banter and information about the upcoming experience. Once the game got underway everybody became very focused and all were keen to beat the 1 hour time limit. The clues and various challenges were difficult but not impossible and if you do get stuck there is a bit of prompting to ease you along. This would be a very good team building exercise for companies to send staff on because it really does need everyone working together to achieve a common goal,(Escape) but is also great for anyone else as well. So overall I would say that this was a thoroughly enjoyable experience which is very reasonably priced, great fun and with a few little surprises thrown in as well. Why are you still reading this review? Get on the phone or internet and book your Escape experience now!!"

In complete honesty, Enigma Escape blew the competitor out of the water - in terms of the overall experience - it was not even close. The creativity and the gameplay of the plot was, imo needless to say, much superior.On a business level, I have to hand it down to Sam (the owner/operator). From product creation and execution to amazing customer relationship management, I am sure his company will go a long way. Great hosting and overall hospitality goes a long way. Sam - the stuff like snacks, drinks, badges, and medals were great and very much appreciated. Small details make a big difference in the outcome of customer satisfaction levels - and my expectations were EXCEEDED.I will definitely be back (and looking forward) as a returning customer when Sam opens up his second escape room!Great Job!"

The puzzles were quite realistic; rather thanrandom numbers and clues, the puzzles were meaningful and it felt moretrue to life. There were 4 of us all together which was a goodnumber. Puzzles were generally quite linear so this is a good escaperoom for smaller numbers of people. The puzzles were of a mediumdifficulty, I'd say this was a good room for noobies to escape roomsto start out. That being said, my team still had to cash in a coupleof clues so it wasn't all plain sailing!Hon was a great host and gave us loads of freebies.

And we absolutely loved it. You start with a quick introduction from your host (Hon, in our case) and then shown a short scene-setting video. After this, you're led into a small room and the door locked behind you. Now you're on your own. It's dark, except for a monitor on the wall showing the time you have left: 60 minutes. There's a metal fence in front of you. There's seemingly no way out. As you poke around in the dark, you start to discover objects. Can they help you? You're not sure. As you make your way through the game, you become completely immersed in the story. Everything seems so real...A few times we repeated ourselves; ran out of ideas. Each time, a little \"ding\" sound came over the speakers and a hint appeared on the monitor. These little tips were just enough to nudge us in the right direction.We made it out with 2:48 to spare. Not the fastest by any means but it didn't matter. This isn't a game where you try to out-do other players. This is a game where you try to beat the clock and your own assumptions about what you see in front of you. Looking back, what I liked about it was that everything seemed to have a purpose; there were no red-herrings or random objects. So, when you finally made it out, everything made sense.Fantastic fun and highly recommended."

There was a bit that made us scream (well I screamed which freaked everyone else out)We managed to escape with 20:31! 2nd quickest time so far! We loved it! So much fun! We cannot wait to return when they have a new story!Thanks for a great evening!"

We had never done an escape room before so were unsure what to expect! We were welcomed by a well informed polite guy and looked after with refreshments whilst watching a short film before the game began! I cannot say too much more, only that it was absolutely brilliant! It tested how you work as a team, whilst having a giggle too and we finished with 02:12 minutes remaining on the clock - an amazingly satisfying feeling - needless to say we went away grinning at our success and chatting about it between ourselves for hours! I would highly recommend this experience to groups, couples, anyone looking to have a fun hour or so!!"

This was the second 'Escape Room' experience I have been on, and it was an excellent and satisfying experience - the puzzles were actually logical, well thought out, and immersive.In my previous 'Escape Room' experience in another part of London, I had found it quite frustrating because the puzzles weren't really puzzles - they were just frustrating time wasters, requiring the entire place to be turned upside down and inside out, necessitating endless hints from the game organisers who even said (quite proudly, it seemed to me) that 'no one gets anywhere without plenty of hints'. But that's not good design - a good design should mean that you can work it all out yourself - but the occasional hint might point you in the right direction.Enigma Escape was the perfect experience. When we did find that we needed a little hint, the hints given were just slight pointers towards something we may have already considered and then dismissed - rather than blatant explanations of what to do.It was a really great day, and our game host, Sam, really looked after us. 5 stars!"

We were lead into the briefing room and surprised when we were offered snacks and drink - nice touch and so far so good! Then the game began, we watched a short intro video how the story started and got locked in a cage. I can't tell you anymore from this point onwards as there will be spoilers. All I can say is the story and puzzles are cleverly designed and it felt like a real life situation escaping from a killer within the time allocated (60 mins). There are surprises after surprises throughout the experience and we managed to escape with just under 5 mins remaining.The experienced didn't just stop there as the host spent a good 10 mins talking to us about the game, what we did well and their vision for future games. We had the chance to take photos which was great fun and was given souvenirs for escaping from the killer.The whole experience was awesome, exciting and thrilling.

Hon is always there to help no matter what to ensure you get the most out of the experience. We were treated with drinks and popcorn during the introduction and then once give very clear and concise instructions/rules we were locked in the escape room with an hour to escape. Of course, there was a key on the door for emergencies which made us all feel safe, but of course the fun is had not using the key but using the clues to escape. I highly highly recommend this place. I will definitely be returning when Hon expands with more escape rooms. A true GEM in London."

When we got there, we were greeted by Hon in a very welcoming way, and he is a very lovely man who is clearly an entrepreneur who knows what he is doing. I am 16, my brother is 17, and the escape experience itself was rather challenging, but we managed to complete it with 5 minutes to spare! There was a lot of detail and care taken into the story and set up of the escape challenge too, with awesome gadgets and features included (I wont give anything away). I certainly believe that this experience is great for teens or older (it may be slightly too challenging and scary for children; no hints but the first escape room [they are yet to build others, but they are on the way] is called 'the killer' so not suitable for young children). The entire challenge was exciting the whole way through and I really felt like I was in a spy movie, and with numerous special features or controls, it wasn't hard to forget that it's all fake! Furthermore, we started in a 'cinema' and were given complementary refreshments to make it seem even more real life. I can see that Hon is really passionate about the escape rooms, and too right, they're excellent! I definitely recommend this experience to anyone looking for a fun challenge and day out, something different to the typical cinema, or the park: something for interesting people!"

So having no experience of what to do or expect we wondered how we would do.Our host Hon was fantastic, having explained how it worked, (you can go through the escape room without hints and tips if you are experienced), but for us, Hon was able to give us a small hint if we were stuck for too long on any aspect of the Game. It was just amazing how the game flowed and the adventure unfolded, which was amazing considering we hadn't done this before & all credit to Hon.We all said what an epic hour this was, full of puzzles, codes & surprises, 24 hours on & we're all still buzzing about it.So my wife & I, (in our fifties) took our daughter & friend (16) and were a team of 4, great number for interaction and bouncing ideas.Overall a fantastic and unique experience, you don't need to be athletic or mega intelligent just keep an open mind and try and think clearly & logically, which is tricky when all you want to do is rush and panic!Best time ever, would do it all again, can't tell you anything about the content it would just ruin it for you, but book your Engima Escape NOW !!!

I have done these escape games in New York City, Birmingham and London, this is by FAR the best one that I have been to.Very easy to find, very friendly and welcoming member of staff (Hon) and a great price with the 25% off special offer! This game is very different to others that I have done before, in others I have played you are trying to solve a crime or just solving a random assortment of puzzles that don't make any real sense or add to the story. From the moment it begins you are involved in the story, not on the outside looking in, you're playing it from your prospective, you're not solving crimes, you are trying to escape for your safety.All of the puzzles and challenges are all linked to the story, the whole thing flows well and you are constantly thinking, trying to work out how to escape. We didn't manage to escape but discovered we were very close to getting out, after that we were taken to do a promotional photo where there was a huge selection of signs, banners, emojis etc to hold up, something I've not seen at a UK game before.When the new games open me and my friend will be visiting again, something we stated at the time as it is in a different league to ones we've done before. Also this is one of the few that accommodates for 2 people games, many start at 3 people only. If you are looking to do an escape challenge this is THE one to tackle."

Our host, Hon was brilliant and provided us with drinks and snacks before the game, gave us hints when we really needed them and to say that they are a very new company, gave a great service.

We browsed Google for quite a while but many looked like fairly generic murder mysteries whilst a lot also don't cater for 2 players. However, Enigma Escape did cater for 2 plus it has a really cool edgy horror/film theme to go with it. Being a fan of horror films, I had to give this a go. On arrival, we met Hon who is a complete legend. Enigma Escape is a new company and was helped out by crowdfunding. Nevertheless, the money has been used well as there are a lot of little nice touches that I won't spoil for anyone who decides to visit. The game itself is superb. The difference to other escape rooms is that you don't find random objects and crack codes with them. Everything is like it would be in a normal room and you have to use normal logic to get out as if you are really trapped. There are some really good puzzles throughout and the horror/tension is done really well. Five stars and I can't recommend this company enough."

Situated minutes away from Holloway road station, the location is very easy to find and get to.We were greeted by one of the owners (Hon), who showed us around and led us into a smaller room to watch an introduction video and explained the rules. Prior to the start of the short video we were offered complimentary soft drinks and popcorn :)Once the video ended, we entered 'The Room' to begin our escape. The puzzles were very well thought out and requires logical thinking in order to over the obstacles. There is T.V screen showing the timer and if you get stuck, hints will be provided.Overall, it was an outstanding experience with great hospitality/customer service. Would definitely visit again when Enigma Escapes opens more rooms."

            "review": "Enjoyable New Experience!. Myself and four friends decided to take up the challenge of escaping 'The Killer' after hearing great things about Enigma Escape via numerous social networks.The idea is pretty simple, you and your friends get locked in a small room, in which you'll then have to uncover a number of puzzles to solve, in order to escape before 'The Killer' returns. Hon, our host was very friendly and welcoming upon our arrival. After a brief explanation of what we should expect and a few general rules, we was ushered into a small dark room followed by the sound of the lock bolting shut be hide us. Without going into detail and ruining it for others, what happened from there on after only got our minds thinking and blood racing. Besides having a blast with the puzzles, I couldn't help but stop to think of how clever everything was organised. A great new experience which I would definitely want to experience again."

            "review": "Fun and thoroughly recommended!. Awesome experience and very welcoming staff. The room was well build and thought out. The puzzles weren't overly complex, though required some thinking and teamwork to solve logically. I say logically because there weren't random items hidden in weird obscure places that people wouldn't normally place unlike some other escape rooms. I'd say that the current room is geared more towards mid-teens and above. As part of the kickstarter we got shown around the place and had the opportunity to watch the next group of people try to escape the room. Advice and hints were friendly and professional, even when people were still struggling. Imagine (for those of you old enough) when Crystal maze was on the TV and you were shouting at the screen when the solutions were painfully obvious and people still failed to complete them. Location is only a few mins walk from Holloway Road underground so it was convenient and not far from the Arsenal stadium for you footie fans.Oh and free drinks, popcorn and medallions if you manage to survive which was a nice touch in comparison to competitors. Looking forward to the next room guys!!!"

Its really well located, being just around the corner from Holloway Road Tube Station. We arrived about 5 minutes before the booking. One of the games creators was on hand to explain what was going to happen and some of the rules around the game. Afterwards you are shown in introductory video and locked in your room. It was an immersive experience, with the puzzles being well thought out and not really just random stuff thrown together. There were a few surprises and there was a sense of progress through out the game. You can see how much time you have left via a television and occasionally the hosts will send in hints if you are having issues.If you like puzzle apps and games you will really appreciate what the creators of Enigma Escape have put together and we will be going back to play the second game when it gets up and running."

My wife and I had an AWESOME time at Enigma escape and highly recommend it.Having done several other exit games, I can definitely say that \"The Killer\" ranks in my personal top three favourites. It definitely is not the standard type of random numbers, open locks, repeat style. It is much more an experience following a theme. This is what sets Enigma apart from the crowd. The puzzles logically follow what one would try in real life, which makes it that much more fun.Besides the room, I have to say something about the owners. These are two friendly guys who definitely have a passion for the exit game genre. This passion is seen in the quality of the venue and quality of the game mechanics. They treated us really well which added to our enjoyment.Hopefully next time we are back in London, they will have a new room open, so we can come back for another round."

We met our host (Hon one of the games creators) and we were shown around and taken to a smaller room to begin our escape. Hon was an entertaining host and really set the scene well, he was very approachable and hospitable. We wore comfortable clothes and had to leave our bags and phones in a safe place outside the game room. Also we were allowed to bring in our drinks with us and could leave the room at any time in case we needed a breather etc. It was a tonne of fun and really immersive. It was exciting and scary at times and the scenario/ theme was entirely believable and maintained throughout the escape.Would 100% recommend for anybody looking for a brain teasing activity and/ or who enjoys games in general. This is a truly unique experience that you and your friends won't forget any time soon. "

Full of unexpected developments and surprises, it's immersive, has an awesome setting and really gets you thinking against the clock! There were 3 of us, We had an hour to escape and were left with under 2 minutes left! So close! We'll be returning for the new rooms when available (along with bringing some new people) and have been discussing it since we went! PERFECT FOR:Definately go, would be perfect for a birthday, stag do activity, general evening activity with friends or maybe a nice alternative to a date where you work together as a couple as teams are allowed to be 5 and under! Some of the themes might be a little intense for really young kids, but teens and up would find this enjoyable. STAFF:Super friendly staff and willing to answer questions, very welcoming and enthusiastic about the project which really makes you all the more excited about the experience. FOOD:On here it says \"food available for purchase\" which wasn't applicable BUT they have complimentary soft drinks/water and they gave us some popcorn too :) CONCLUSION: Do it :p"

It's appropriately challenging in places and we all had to work together to escape The Killer!Best of all were the little extras we were given, a snack and drink before the game and a shiny medallion for successfully escaping. My only criticism was that the lighting when we had our photo taken was quite dark so it wasn't the best photo(Though maybe that was just part of the mood)Overall we all had a great time and I look forward to seeing what the guys come up with next!"

We had all played about 5 other escape games before. This one is a bit different, Enigma Escape's USP is that they are more immersive. In the game you are part of a story which is relevant throughout unlike other rooms where the story usually stops as you enter the room and it is all about the puzzles.Pros:Visually fantastic, props are great.Best out of room experience and the hosts are good.Some really special and surprising moments in the game (spoilers if I say more).Easy to find.Slightly different experience than other London escape roomsCons:We escaped in just over 40 mins, which is the fastest we have escaped from anywhere although it was the fastest time they had so far and we are very experienced.Story driven experience meant the puzzles were the weakest part. But they were in their first week and have potential improvement.Overall 9/10. Definitely worth a try for experienced escape room players."

I had booked a midday slot with my boyfriend for us to experience the immersive room escape and I wasn't disappointed.Myself and my boyfriend love video games and logic puzzles such as Portal and arcade games such as IloMilo. I decided to back this project on Kickstarter in early 2015 because I thought it would be really interesting and fun - I was spot on. THE EXPERIENCE:They recommend 90 minutes for the experience and are you're advised to arrive 10 minutes before your booked slot, your host talks you through the rules and you watch the introduction video. You're then locked in a room for 60 minutes with the goal to escape before the time runs out. After you escape (or don't), you then see a conclusion video - this changes depending on whether you made it out or not. The system was slick and the experience was like no other. Unlike other escape the room experiences, there are no actors in this. It really is you and your friends locked in a room trying to find a way out. You have the options of clues from your host if you get really stumped, and there is a screen inside the locked room so you know how much time you have left.Don't worry about being locked in the room, if you ever need a breather, there is a key hooked on the door you entered through if you really need to take a time out.You can book for teams between 2 and 5 (at the moment), it takes team work, logic and some off the wall thinking to get through the immersive experience. We had such a great time that I'm telling EVERYONE about it and am ready for the Engima Escape team to create their second experience so I can book in!CUSTOMER SERVICE:The team themselves are wonderful, Hon was our host for the experience, and he was great fun. As they also knew it was my birthday the day before our visit, we were welcomed to happy birthday banners and they even bought me a cake! If that isn't a sign of thoughtful customer service, I don't know what is!EXTRAS:You don't need to take anything extra with you. And although I've ticked food and drink available, it's more snacks than anything. But if you do get peckish for something a bit more substantial there's a pub/bar on the corner of the road it's on, and a Tesco express a stones throw away. Obviously - you're not there for food, you're there for the activity!SUMMARY:If you and your friends/partner/family love puzzles and are looking to take it up a notch, I would highly recommend Enigma Escape. It's as much fun as you expect, and a little more."

            "review": "Exciting new addition to London's escape room options. I've played a variety of the escape rooms that London has to offer, and have started to get a feel for what I like. In my opinion, while this isn't the best of the rooms on offer, it's perfectly playable, particularly if you go with a smaller group (we went with five, which meant at times some of us felt less active participants in the game). It's quite linear, so you'll usually be focused on solving one challenge before moving on to the next. Having said that, clues are well delivered, at just the right moments, so your team is unlikely to get too frustrated in the room, but equally you won't feel like you're being spoon fed.The one place this stands out is that it didn't feel too contrived. That was a refreshing change - not having to find every number in the room and input on each of the padlocks. The room itself is well themed - this isn't just an office space with some props thrown in. They've gone to real trouble to get the atmosphere right. In sheer numbers of puzzles it's on the low side, but there are some quite neat ones thrown in there, and one in particular which was a particularly nice effect.Overall it's a solid escape room, well themed, but let down a bit by the intro and wrap up videos. As with all escape rooms across London, I think newbies will enjoy it because they've not get anything to compare it to. Experienced players will enjoy it for the theming and a couple of fun puzzle mechanism. Those of you in the middle might feel a little disappointed, depending on which parts of and escape room are most important to you."

Tried this escape game with four girlfriends following a catch up over lunch at Canary Wharf but was pretty disappointed - great idea but poorly executed. There were various clues in the room to open several padlocks though no storyline to link anything or provide any interest - it was just a case of finding a number/word and trying every lock so no real sense of achievement. We escaped from the room in around 40 minutes only to find we were in another room with further clues. I'd lost interest at this point and was quite happy when the chap who was looking after us (the coordinator watches via a camera and provides additional clues via a screen if needed) came and solved the missing clues."

The puzzles were ok but by that point we all felt pretty cheated. Having played lots of other escape games, this one didn't compare at all. We solved the game and thankfully got out of the sweaty box that was the room!To add insult to injury we went back into the back room where all out belongings were only to find about 10 other random people sat on our coats and bags etc.. not exactly secure!We paid half price for this and felt cheated.

It was really good and we had a brilliant time and we got out with more time to spare, 11 seconds last time and this time 6 minutes 20 seconds. The girl that was there (sorry can't remember her name) was lovely and helpful going through everything before we started as some things are different in each escape room. We approached things much calmer this time and only asked for clues when really stuck. If I'm being honest I preferred the Breakout better but either one is great and makes you think. There is also another room there and we would have no hesitations about going back to try that one too. An enjoyable way to spend an hour (or less if you manage to escape quicker)."

Was a lot of fun, Staff were supper friendly and made you feel right at ease. 3 of us went, I think if you had more we would have solved it a bit quicker but it does also depend on those in the group. We did chaos, the clues were well designed and fairly easy to work out, there were about 15 puzzles to solve in total which meant the game moved at a good pace and you didn't find yourself waiting for the next thing to happen. Will go back again soon as there are 2 other games to complete. Id say suitable for teens and up wards purely for the fact some of the clues can be cryptic and need to be come at from a variety of view points and if you use wowcher or groupon the more that play the more you save. 5*"

Having only done one escape room previously, I am still very much a beginner of this type of activity.There were 3 of us attempting the 'Outbreak' room, which is the medium difficulty of the three rooms available.We booked through an online discount website, giving us 50% off, which I'm glad of, as the normal price of \u00a330 each seems very expensive for this room.On arrival, we were met by a female member of staff, who was very friendly however, there was no sort of introduction or background chat and basically, this is the door to the escape room and in you go.We thought with it being called Sherlock Unlock, branded with Sherlock Holmes type logos etc that this was the theme, however, the only thing Sherlock Holmes'y was the box of props to get your photo taken with. Perhaps the other two rooms were that theme but the outbreak wasn't...this was some sort of biological outbreak gone wrong but the room did not go with that theme.A couple of pieces of old furniture, a piece of biohazard tape over the door and a couple of puzzles....it was all a bit basic. There is a lot of room for improvement and although we were given a couple of clues (unprompted might I add) we broke out in 38 minutes. On exiting, I expected a well done, this is your time, a photo opportunity with the digital clock and perhaps a piece of A4 paper certificate of some sort with your time etc on it but there was none of that. We got asked if we would have our picture taken for their website page with the hat and pipe and magnifying glass prop, which we obliged.So in conclusion; an average and basic escape room, with an average customer experience and ok for \u00a313 each but not for \u00a330 each.

We were a bit early and when we arrived nobody was there. But the host Rory arrived within 10 minutes of us getting there. We were shown into a room where Rory explained the two rooms and how everything worked in them. He told us that clues would come up on the t.v screen in each room, or we could ask for clues if we were stuck. I must admit an hour sounded a long time but as the clock started ticking down you don't realise how the time goes so quick. It certainly brings out your groups personality traits - mine was to stay calm and work through things systematically, my youngest daughter approached everything quite laid back with no urgency which made us look at things carefully at times, and my oldest daughter, well now I know who the competitive one in the family is, looking at clues and trying to solve them in a mad frenzy, all the while shouting out to Rory to give us the next clue. We eventually broke out of the room with 11 seconds to spare. We all really enjoyed it and will try and go back to do the other room and take advantage of the 50% discount you get if you book directly on their website, which is for returning customers."

I had expected someone to be there to say well done in person.They team who runs the games should also make sure that those booked for the rooms are allowed access. We were in the second room, at the final door figuring out the combinations to the padlocks when someone from the outside tried to get in.

I've tried 4 other escape rooms before, and this is by far the worst.The room we played was Outbreak, and from what I can read here Chaos seems to have similar problems.1. There is no flow of the puzzles - just a couple of doors with a bunch of padlocks on each. Trying all the codes on all of them gets very repetitive, as previous reviewers said.2. The host did not provide the helps when we asked for them - instead she seemed to decide for herself when to do it. If this is how this quest is supposed to work, this should have been explained in the beginning, as helps are provided on demand in other quests.3. SOME HELPS POINTED TO A RED HERRING. I think this is unfair as the helps are supposed to point you in the right direction. Considering that the helps are pre-written and appear on a screen, this is an inherent design flaw.4. When we escaped the room no one greeted us at the end - we only figured out that the quest is finished when we looked at the timer and saw that it stopped - then we just had to go and find the host ourselves.Anyway, I'm glad we got it cheap on a Groupon deal at least - it's too disappointing to pay the full price."

I wanted to like it and the hosts were very friendly but that could not make up for the utter lack of sense inside the room. The props were cheap and tacky and actually a lot didn't work properly so even when we had the right numbers/codes we could not use them and had to be prompted to 'keep trying'. Logic and thinking outside of the box could not help us escape because the puzzles were nonsense that could not be worked out without copious clues. I have tried 5 other rooms and this one was so poor, I recommend going to another if this is not your first because escape rooms should be better thought out than this one."

It had a story but it was just a piece of paper that we had to read to ourselves and it wasn't permeated throughout the room, so didn't have much point. It was far from immersive as it was in an office building and was dressed with IKEA furniture. The puzzles were basically just a load of locks to unlock which got a bit repetitive, but they weren't that. Unfortunately all the other factors let the experience down, like how were also rushed out at the end after escaping the room because we couldn't be left in the same room as the other group's possessions. With more concentration on detail and investing in some lockers would greatly improve this room."

A time-travel back story was provided in the Chaos version that we did but it didn't really follow through very well - not sure it's necessary, might just be worth coming up with a simpler lock-in story, otherwise would need some more work to make it relevant.

The clues on the TV screen were really helpful and came when we really got stuck. We were so excited every time we solved a clue and opened a padlock. However, when we got out of the room we were shocked to find another room we needed to exit. It was good that there were lots of bits in the room that had nothing to do with the clues. It was also funny when we thought we had completed it which gave another slant to the game. We got out with 50 seconds to spare. Great host. Great fun and I would definitely recommend it.

There was a plethora of locks and some seemed not to budge properly, but our host was quick to sort out the problem, if he knew that we knew the correct code. Unfortunately, the clues do not really indicate which lock it is the code for, so if you have got a 4 digit code, you will be trying every 4 digit lock going.On the whole, because of the host and it being our first experience of an escape game, I'll give this a high rating.

We did Chaos but based on my friend's experience the other room Outbreak was also pretty poor. There was no atmosphere setting from the host (very nice guy and perfectly helpful about the admin part of things), we were led into the room and told we had 60 mins. Fine - not a dealbreaker but 10-1=9. There were some interesting looking puzzles in there but so much IKEA furniture with the STICKER ON them it really ruins the game: 9-1=8. There so many red herrings in there (I know we need some, we always do) but when you are basically trying out all 4-digit numbers on every padlock to see if it works then you know there is no such thing as a \"flow\" when this game was planned. 8-1=7. There are only padlocks in the rooms, nothing else in terms of technical solutions - at some point I felt like this was a 101 in how NOT to do an escape room. 7-1=6. There were no less than 4 padlocks on the door and 2 on the drawers which meant the solving one puzzle didn't give you anything. I get that this kind of game is also for team-building & communication, but in that case please please please get different drawers/boxes/anything with pieces of one puzzle. Putting four different locks on the door is ugly, inelegant and just really not very fun: 6-5=4. There was one really interesting looking puzzle towards the end which we didn't have to crack and still escaped (and left one drawer locked)...how could that happen? 4-3=2. We didn't just blindly try numbers, I swear (though that would have worked too because padlocks were of really bad quality 2-1=1) which means there the whole room wasn't coherent! I'm really sorry guys, I can see the business case in opening an escape room in Canary Wharf and I really wanted to like it but this was the worst room I have ever done (I've de 12 in 4 cities so far: London, Budapest, Barcelona, Mumbai). Either then price this at \u00a310 complete beginner level or better still - take a break and completely redesign the puzzles. If you are going I guess I have one piece of advice - go with less than 4 people or go alone if you are advanced and try to not look for any logical flow, just solve puzzles, ask for clues (without which there is no way to solve some of them) and move one. So far, any other escape room is better in the London market. Please don't be lazy and stay in the Wharf, just go to any other one. Sorry guys, honest opinion here."

Other escape rooms have had a real theme to them but this one felt a bit like a few props and padlocks were thrown inside. Puzzles were alright but didn't have much continuity to them. It felt a bit like work out a code and then apply it to all padlocks in the hope that one opens. I think Sherlock Unlock has a lot of room to grow and currently represents good value with the prices it offers.

We did the event as a couple - I think most people went with a group of 5-6 which would have probably worked better as there were so many problems to solve in the hour!However this didn't stop us having a great time. Spent the first ten minutes thinking we never successfully escape however the coordinator was very helpful at giving a little hint to point you in the right direction just as you were giving up hope, and by the end we were getting the hand of thinking outside of the box rather than logically! Happily we escaped in the hour, but needed to head for a drink given all the adrenaline!Great fun, we are already coordinating a time to get together with friends to try the other room.100% recommend to others!"

It was really challenging and made us think hard, but not without lots of giggles and laughter. Without giving away any spoilers, there was a part where I got sooo excited realising how much more there was to the game!!! I was very impressed with the attention to detail, which is perhaps the best i've experienced and the sheer level of the challenge. I loved how funny & attentive the girls who run it are. Oh, and the fact that its set in this quirky, fun pub was just the icing on the cake ! All in all, a fabulous game and one that i would not hesitate to recommend again and again."

We all love puzzles and problem-solving but this game is not that. It is not a game that requires any skill merely lots of people running round like headless chickens looking for keys and codes.You get locked in a room for an hour and told to solve the murder. At the end of the game you still have no idea who the murderer was or why. There is no logic or story to follow you merely have to find hidden keys and numbers to open padlocks. After thirty minutes of looking (by which time boredom was beginning to set in) clues start appearing on the screen or should I say instructions? It then becomes a game of following what you were told to achieve and merely plodding along finding things as some are placed in such obscure places. A few puzzles are included but not many and by the time the game finished I really couldn\u2019t have cared less who the murderer was and I never found out because the aim of the game is to get out of the room not solve the mystery. This is a key flaw and left us feeling we had wasted an hour of our lives.We had expected a storyline with a progressive set of puzzles to solve which eventually led to an answer. None of this was the case. We will not be doing another hint hunt or recommending it to any one else. In future we will stick to Cluedo or the Sherlock Holmes game which at least has a definite storyline and answers to find.This was a very expensive mistake"

I've been to quite a few escape rooms and I would say this was more on the challenging side! I like to think we're quite good at finding things as a team, but this room had some very sneaky places and we needed clues to find a couple. The clues to help were very timely but tried to be a bit cryptic so you still felt like you were solving the clue without being handed the solution. All in all I really enjoyed it, we escaped with just a minute and a half to go. I would suggest that if you are a beginner, this might not be the ideal room to visit, as there are quite a few red herrings and difficult hiding places.

Without giving anything away, you had to solve a mystery and find keys and codes to unlock things. When you first enter the room you aren't really sure what to do, but then you quickly get into the swing of it. It was really clever. There were gentle hints along the way to stop any frustration. The hour went so quickly. You do have to be able to move around quickly as you are against the clock, so my 82 year old mother in law found that a little difficult at times. And you do have to get on the floor at times. I went to bed last night still buzzing from the hour, and we did nothing but talk about our experience in the car going home.I can't wait to go back and do the Zen room.

The HintHunt was great, well organised and the people were fun and friendly. The game itself was great, I played the detective game and it was very creative and made you think out side the box. Being able to look around and not have to tidy as you went made me feel like I was part of the old TV programme \"Finders Keepers\" which was epic! The hour seemed to whizz by and it was a great time had by all. Would recommend if you like cryptic clues, riddles and solving puzzles."

They were all fun, but Hint Hunt is by far the most thought through and best. Loved it! I'd recommend a group of 4 or 5, especially if you've never done an escape room before as it was quite challenging with 3."

Took my son for his 12th birthday on Sunday, we did Clue Quest last year and the room we did was aimed at children, he loved it so much he wanted to go back again unfortunately couldn't get in as fully booked, so though we would try this one.Great intro from the young lady,all well and good but when you get into the room there just doesn't seem to be a process, a story or a structure? I'm sure if we had been 4 adults we could have managed it better?? but with a 12 year old and a 7 year old we needed a lot of help. Trust me I'm not thick and neither is my partner but some of the things we didn't complete were just not on our radar, if I had been there 3 hours still would not have got it without the help on the TV screen. We did the Zen room which was a Japanese setting there are other settings apparently whether we picked the wrong one or it was just not right for the kids I don't know, but we all came out saying Clue quest was better. I would seriously think about taking younger children to this one as the kids were a little disappointed there wasn't more of a story to it. Venue was good, well organised and the young lady was very pleasant, so not taking anything away from the team there it just wasn't right for the kids."

As we were such a big group it was hard to find an escape room that could cater for our size, but HintHunt was perfect as they have 5 rooms in total. I also found they're pretty good value for money.

In addition, at the end of the game (we couldn't escape!) we found the lady who had helped us to be almost critical of our performance, which felt a bit odd, and slightly dampened our enjoyment. We have subsequently visited clueQuest, which we found far superior, because of the positivity of the staff, the clarity of the pre-game briefing, and the types of puzzles involved. We did enjoy it, but there are better escape games around."

Sadly it fell flat towardss the end of our visit. We clearly didn't understand what they were trying to tell us on the promptor and I guess that as English is a second language to the game controllers they were struggling to communicate correctly to help us overcome the issue. We pointed out to them how they could have communicated the clue and how what they had told us was ambiguous at the conclusion of the game. They didn't seem at all welcoming to our constructive criticism and were rather dismissive of it. I think we left with an extra sour taste because we had all enjoyed it so much the first time that to encounter these issues the second time was very disappointing. As we were there to impress our company bosses as to what a great team building exercise this could be they only hurt future business from our company. Ihave experienced similar rooms in Warsaw and Budapest and left feeling nothing but pleased with the experience. This encounter was second rate in comparison."

We had to give up on that approach though fairly early on, as the puzzles were relentless and there was so much to do in the hour that we needed to take the gamesmaster's clues in the end! Ultimately, our arrogance cost us and we didn't escape, though we weren't far off! A few too many puzzles crammed in to this and a few things hidden in particularly obscure places, so if you play it, just take the hints. Though it seems a bit silly for it not to be solvable without hints, as that's part of the fun - to see how well you can do alone. A great room, but not our favourite one we've done."

My friend has also visited New York and played games there too, so we are quite experienced in this field now! We often look to trip advisor for advice on which game to try next and having now completed every game at clue quest (which I HIGHLY recommend), we decided to give hint Hunt a go as it seems to be the next most popular in London. We had high hopes, especially after playing our 3rd and final game at clue quest that morning. It is safe to say we were both left feeling extremely confused and disappointed, and actually a bit angry! In comparison to all of the other games we have played this feels cheap, old and not well thought out. The storyline of the game I could not even tell you, as unlike other games I would not describe this as an 'immersive' experience. You are CONSTANTLY fired clues over the walkie talkie/tv screen and there is absolutely no way you could figure it out without some of these clues and to me that totally misses the point of the game. I want to figure out the puzzles myself, not have to be reliant on clues!I can't really say too much without giving any of the game away but I was honestly sooo disappointed with this game. We will not be heading back to play the other game!! (We played JMs Office). When we left we both looked at each other in shock really that we had just paid so much money to be so let down. Hint hunt is one of the more expensive escape games, but having always got what we paid for at clue quest and reading great reviews we weren't bothered about the cost. We are still now 2 weeks later confused at how this place has such great reviews! It feels so behind the times and basic in comparison to other games we've played. I think it's time they played some of the newer games in London and took some inspiration from them to update their game and lose the need for constant hints!!"

Booked this with 3 work colleagues and none of us had ever done an escape game so we went for the highest one on trip advisor as we can really get to any in London quite easily.We were wrong to do that as this was not a game of skill. You get bunged in a room full of about 10 padlocks and number combination devices and have to then solve the clues except there aren't any real clues and there's no real path to take. It was like a free for all trying to work out if something was maybe a code for a safe or case or padlock etc and whether it was a code at all.They give you hints on a screen and said that anyone that gets out usually does it between 53 and 60 minutes - the reason for this is that around 30 minutes in, it turns from a game of having stuff everywhere not knowing what to do, to someone telling you on screen exactly what to do almost word for word or by using pictures, which wasnt really a problem solving and more just a task following exercise. Some things were also hidden in places that you would never think of and some combinations were just ridiculous theorys like (without giving too much away) taking a number of suspects date of births, working out their ages, combining them and then opening a lock - you could literally be in that room for 10 years and not think of that.What we expected was more of a team work progressive exercise where you start with just one lock and work your way through rather than loads of different locks.We will try another escape game but its not going to be Hint Hunt. Its not really enjoyable just following what to do and its literally impossible without the clues (instructions). Its also quite expensive for effectively locking you in a room for an hour."

We had 3 in one team and 4 in the other - both teams did fine, but having 4 people is definitely be the best number (which is what the HintHunt guys recommend). We had a blast and spent the rest of the day talking about how much fun it was! Obviously I won't give anything away here, but the clues are very varied and challenging, and suitable for everyone (not very physical, some of them are numerical, some logical, some scrambling around looking for something, and everyone can pitch in as there's always so much to do at once). The team at HintHunt make sure you have help if you need it (we did - a lot) and even if you don't get out on time, they'll see you through to the end so you can complete the room anyway. We're coming back to do the Japanese Zen rooms to see if we can make it within the hour!"

Staff were friendly and welcoming. Would totally recommend this as something to do with friends, or for work teams to have a go at. Rooms are a max of 5 people so if there's a large group (as we were) you will be split into groups of that size or smaller for the duration.

Just the right amount! We have done other rooms - this was by far the most difficult, but also the most rewarding in terms of puzzles. Could not recommend more highly! In terms of ages, I am not sure I would go much younger. The staff at HintHunt made the whole experience very clear, understandable, welcoming and not at all daunting."

On arrival at Hinthunt we had to leave for a little while as we were early and there was not much of a waiting area. This seems to be a common factor with games based in London and I suppose it is due to the huge rental costs in the country's capital. When we returned we were welcomed by the excellent host who explained the premise of the game to us, before taking us into the room. The set was built extremely well and it was clear that lots of time and effort had been put into creating exciting and challenging puzzles. The only negative we found here was that there was a large number of red herrings. Whilst we are not against the odd \"false clue\" we found that the sheer volume of them took up so much of our time that we did not have the time to properly solve the genuine clues, and therefore required too many hints from the games master. This meant that puzzles we would normally solve ourself with a little thought were done for us, taking away from the excitement and satisfaction of working something out.Overall the game was very good. The quality of the set and props, along with the enthusiasm and entertainment of the staff made for a very enjoyable day. We will definitely look at attempting their second Zen game in the future."

There was lots to keep us busy and all three of us were constantly hunting for clues and solving challenges. I think it would have been a struggle with less people, so I'd suggest a group of 3 - 4 per room would work best.I wouldn't recommend this as an activity for young children, but for older teens and up it's great.We solved the challenge with 55 seconds left on the clock. A great day out and fantastic fun. We're already looking to book our next challenge, the Zen Room."

            "review": "Good rooms with some adjustment potential. My girlfriend and I decided to tackle both of the rooms featured by HintHunt last weekend. We have a good degree of experience in the genre and so felt well prepared going into the process. For full transparency I should add that we fell short (a minute in one and perhaps 5 in the other) of finishing the rooms. The website does suggest 3 - 5 participants as an ideal figure and so one could also argue there were not enough of us there to find all the clues.First off the staff were very nice and attentive. I found all of the HintHunt team members to be interested and engaged in the running of the rooms and in ensuring that all had a good time.Additionally the room concepts are very good and one differed quite a bit in artistic style to those which we had previously encountered. This alone made the experience quite novel.There were, however three key drawbacks to the experience.First off the rooms rely much more on the concept of searching for things, often small things, than on actually solving riddles/puzzles (which I suspect is why at least 3 participants are recommended). I found this to be quite unbalanced as compared with past experiences. Additionally, the hints provided by the attendants, and there are many many many hints (sometimes when you'd wish you hadn't gotten one) tend to take away from the joy in trying to solve the puzzles. Hints also tend to focus on where to find hidden objects, again putting the focus much more on finding things rather than solving things.The length of the critical sequence of events also seemed quite a bit longer than in a conventional escape room. I suspect this is what adds to the overall perceived difficulty assessment of these rooms. I welcome such an approach as you get more value for your experience. But this should, again, be balanced with the constant searching for objects which is core to so many of the puzzles, as well as the continual stream of hints needed to overcome the challenge of not having found something.Lastly, there are a few worldwide standards for what not to do in an escape room. These typically involve not using excessive force, not opening up fire, electrical, utility panels and not damaging walls and fixtures. These standards are there for a reason, mainly ensuring that one does not get hurt or break the rooms. Also they ensure that certain approaches are discouraged in future room escapes. Without going into game critical detail one of the rooms required that such a standard be broken. I found this disingenuous and frankly unnecessary. it should be changed.Overall though we did have an enjoyable time. If the rooms were focused just a little bit and the searching element was slightly deemphasized, then the need for excessive clues would also be diminished. This would then more seamlessly couple with the excellent storylines in the rooms and provide a much more enjoyable escape experience.I also hear that the next room will be a submarine. Hopefully some of these comments will be taken on board and I look forward to visiting that puzzle on one of my next London trips."

We played the Zen Room as part of an activity day of a hen do and everyone has a good time. Our games master was very welcoming and friendly and helped make the experience more enjoyable; although the clues towards the end of the hour did come thick and fast, and my team occasionally felt like some were unnecessary as we had already figured it out (although, obviously, the game master cannot read your mind, so I would recommend communicating with her/him, as well as your team, clearly about what you have found!). The puzzles ranged in difficulty from finding keys/objects to solving more complicated puzzles. I would recommend the game for adults with teenagers no younger than 14+ (unless they are especially good at logic puzzles). We made it out with just over 2 minutes to spare with our team of 3, and felt a great sense of achievement. I would recommend a team of 3 - 4 people, as it may feel like too many cooks with any more. The only things I would change would be to have a more comfortable/welcoming waiting area and maybe a recent leader board with escape times so that you can compare to other teams (not that I'm competitive or anything;)"

Our team's chosen room for our first ever HintHunt experience was JM\u2019s Office 2. 60 minutes sounds like a long time but the time simply FLIES as you search for and solve clues to escape.Our HintHunt venue was quite compact and the staff was very helpful and friendly. She gave us a detailed briefing beforehand and explained the rules of the game and said that the success rate to beat the game (which we did) was 50%. Overall, HintHunt is a very fun and exciting Live Escape Game Challenge and I will definitely be back with my mates to try and beat the other rooms."

It starts as a bit of a mad panic looking for clues, keys code etc. but after a little while things start dropping into place. You have to work together to have any change of getting out within the allotted time. Very cleverly put togetherYou are watched by one of the Hinthunt team who will occasionally provide clues if you need them.We managed to get out with 2 minutes remaining. We were so excited and chuffed with ourselves.We didn't stop speaking about it all dayCant wait to try the other room."

It was very nice but also extremely hot. At one point we had to switch it off. The hints were very useful. We definitely needed spoon feeding with some of them and they were nice enough to do so hahahBut as soon as we were finished they seemed to be in a rush to get us out of the door... Wish I was able to take a good photo as a memory. This is a service they should provide. As we are not allowed to take a photo of the rooms (understandably) they should have a place where photographs are allowed. Not just the outside of the building. Would I go again ? Yes.

Having started playing Escape Games in Europe, I have been a little disappointed in the London games, but read that \"Hint Hunt\" was the \"original\" Escape Room AND created by Hungarians (Budapest is a bit of a hub for life escapes). As such I had high hopes.My other half and I have now played a number of rooms and we were \"initiating\" a couple who had not done one before. Whilst I would happily say this was by far one of the most engaging rooms (we did JM's Office) - it certainly isn't for the faint hearted. They say only 50% escape, and while as a pair, my OH and I have escaped oon average with around 10-15 minutes to spare, we got out of this as a four with only 2.36 left on the clock. To really enjoy it, I would recommend having done at least one other room first...not only that, but it also makes you appreciate how good Hint Hunt actually is.It is easy to find (right next to Euston Station), and there is a pub next door should you wish to go for a post-game analysis.The room itself is very interesting with a wide range of puzzles, plus a fair amount of searching, and the Gamesmastering is a particular highlight. Hints were given at exactly the right time, but not only that a very good rapport (praise and sense of humour) was built up during the game - the only place we have experienced this previously was on the Continent. It is a much more \"lateral\" game than ClueQuest or Escape Entertainment - the latter two we found a little linear, and in some cases a bit \"lock after lock\". However, you go for what you enjoy!! (There was one puzzle that seemed to require prior knowledge, which is unusual, but it might have been that we failed to find the \"clue\" for that - luckily we knew the answer anyway).It was the first time in a London game that we booked the second room immediately after, and have already spread the word on facebook. This game is an absolute must for seasoned players - a little experience under your belt means you stand a chance of getting out!!"

One minute it is the disappearance of a detective, next a number game.I understand you want to change the types of puzzles in the game, but jumping from real detective work to number puzzles or word association type clues, is jarring.Can't say much for the staff on the night we were there. Grumpy and wanted to go home. Maybe the boss should pay them an extra 15 minutes after game end time so they're not sweeping you out the door?Good idea, poorly executed."

I've now done both rooms (JM's Office twice!), and the rooms have a good variety of styles of puzzles (and decoys). The rooms have very thorough theming providing a very immersive experience. They're also sufficiently detailed that I found that with a decent (1 year ish) time gap I'd forgotten enough that it was still satisfying a second time around with a new team.The clue mechanism works well, not too intrusive but enough to point you in the right direction if stuck (each room has a dedicated staff member watching and listening to you who can feed hints to you if they deem it necessary).The only thing that lets down the experience is the lack of waiting space. As there's only limited briefing area that's also used for a post-game success photo (if applicable!), you're not let into the building until pretty much exactly when you're asked to be there. Luckily the weather's been good when I've gone, but it would have been a poor start to the game if the weather's bad. Likewise, some of the rooms require going outside to access the basement rooms.Here's hoping that the long-awaited third room puts in an appearance soon."

When I finally got around to choosing this company I went to book it only to find the whole of half term week was fully booked up except one time slot so I grabbed the last one. Obviously a popular thing! I had trying to find activities online which would entertain our teenagers during our stay in London and this seemed to fit the bill. We weren't disappointed. We found the building easy enough and the friendly staff explained what we had to do before showing us to the room. For the next hour we were locked in a room and myself, my husband and our teenage son and daughter tried to solve clues, find codes and numbers to combination locks in order to open drawers to get other clues and find hidden objects around the room trying in vain to get out. The big digital timer counted down on the wall showing you how many minutes you had left and occasionally a sound would tell us that the guy watching us on cctv was giving us an extra clue to help us. We never managed to get out alone (we had to be told the 4 digit number) but we were so close apparently. We all thoroughly enjoyed it and cant wait to do another room. Definitely recommend it."

The game started with a quick introduction and some essential tips for playing (i.e. this is also meant to be enjoyable for families with children so don't think too complicated, a clue we sometimes forgot during the game). After the intro we were let into the room and locked in an had to search for clues for how to get out - if stuck or following too far with a red herring, our game master would nudge us into the right direction again. The beginning was really good, and the only clues we needed were very simple (look in drawer again, you missed something) but then towards the end of the game the game master got a little more hint-happy and at times I felt like we weren't given enough time to figure things out on our own, and often the hint would come just as we'd thought of it but hadn't had time to act on yet. Overall still, most hints involved a missing item because we hadn't looked hard enough and not how to solve the puzzle once we had the pieces, so we still felt like we were playing the game and the only help was to make sure we had everything we needed to figure it out. Made it out in time with 1:30min to spare!Perhaps stretching the time limit to 1h15min would let players complete the game on their own without as much help from the game master."

            "review": "Best Hour Of Our Trip. We absolutely loved this! I have to admit, as we pulled up to the door in a cab, to this very innocuous building on a street near Kings Cross, I was a bit dubious but, once we got going, this turned out to be huge fun. We had a party of three, although with one being ill and another one tending to her, we were substantially down in the brains we could apply to this. Without giving too much away, this is basically a mystery you have to solve, by figuring out clues left in the room in which they lock you. As the name suggests, they watch and listen through cameras and microphones and provide you with hints as you go along, so that there's no opportunity to get completely frustrated. You'll start with lots of things to look at, and you will start to figure out questions to ask and puzzles to complete, many of which are highly interrelated. The key to this is communication - always be telling the rest of your team what you're doing, and don't necessarily all follow the same clue. Because there's a clock on the wall counting down the hour that you're in there, the pressure is on and it makes it really fun, especially towards the end when you have the gist of it and are closing in on clues thick and fast. Our only regret, other than the unplanned illness, is that we did this on our last day. Had we done it earlier, we would have absolutely come back to do it again. Fantastic time, totally recommended. We had three adults (one in a wheelchair) and two teens. I would say any group could do this, but you'll need a reasonable command of English and ideally have at least four people actively participating."

It was brilliant! The team member was really welcoming and clear in all her instructions and did great job (Beatrix). The experience itself was amazing - but of course i cant share details or it would ruin it for others. Suffice to say you are locked in a room with lots of puzzles/clues to solve in an hour in order to win and get let out . It was like a crystal maze mental challenge only far better! Would definitely recommend this if you have a team of 2-5 friends and like this kind of challenge. It's quite expensive but a very memorable hour and we came out with big smiles all round (we solved it with 35 seconds to go!)"

Not being one to normally participate in such attractions such as the Hint Hunt, having read all of the positive reviews we arrived at the venue looking forward to it, but without having a clue, (literaly,) as to what to expect. The venue itself is a mere 2-3 minute walk from Euston station, and easily found on the opposite side of the road to station. Upon entering the venue, we were greeted by our enthusiastic host, who explained exactly what we could expect, and also the mandatory safety rules. Moving swiftly into the murder room, the next hour passed in a blur. It would be inappropriate of me to give the game away but I can confim that everybody thoroughly enjoyed the experience and we actually managed to escape with a minute and a half to spare. Big shout out to our host who was supplying hints as and when needed...she kept it challenging and interesting. Top marks too to the team that hides the clues...they must have had fun thinking up some of those hiding places!Looking forward to the zen room on our next visit."

One person on each team had been before but not done the same room, so we knew roughly what to expect but no details.There is a vague premise that someone has been murdered (in the room we completed) but really, you're looking for clues/items and then trying to work out how it all fits together. You have 60 minutes to get out of the room and your remaining time is shown on a screen.Initially the team just needs to search and things then start to fall into place. After 6 minutes or so we had cracked our first clue and there was a period where we pieced several aspects together in quick succession. This isn't always the case and when you hit roadblocks or start going down a wrong path, hints are flashed up on the screen in the room. These are designed to give you enough of a guide, but not too much. It seems that there is a definite goal to get you feeling like you're pretty much there with 10 minutes or so to go. The last 10-15 were certainly very exciting and everyone was totally immersed by then. Cheering ensues for each clue passed and there's a real sense of tension in the air.We got out in 56 minutes and 33 seconds. Only about 50% of people actually manage it and the record is something like 53 minutes so we were pleased all in all!Naturally, as 2 groups we were competing with one another and this stimulated lots of chat afterwards over a few beers.I would heartily recommend this to anyone for a bit of fun and even to businesses for team building purposes!"

Also the back story is hard to follow and not really relevant to the experience. There's someone watching and listening in on your attempt to escape so if you get stuck the phone rings and a hint appears on a TV screen. We had something like 5-10 hints throughout and got out with 2 mins to spare. Would be very interested to know how long it would take with no hints!

I can't say too much without spoiling the game for others, but what a great hour we had.

One of the definite highlights was the way they deliver hints on a tv screen I found it much less intrusive compared to many other similar places."

We did not solve the game but it didn't matter it was the process that was fun. This is a great team effort and a nice way to connect with friends and family. It was one of the highlights of the kids trip to London. Our guide for the game was engaging, fun and informative - we enjoyed his hints through out the game that kept us moving forward. They are located near a metro station - only a two minute walk so easy access. The area it's self has a few \"girlie\" shops so not a great area to hang out with kids but we found a bar with outdoor seating while we were waiting for our start time."

The tips on the computer screen throughout were invaluable and are what makes the experience. The only thing I would say is that the price seemed quite steep for what it was.

Cleverly it all starts to unfold and makes sense, like an unravelling mystery. The game gradually picks up the pace and you really start to feel the pressure to crack the clues as the clock counts down - till the last few minutes when it actually got quite frenzied! In our case we didn't make it out in time and it probably would have taken us another 15 minutes - but it really can be done, and the guys do help you along. We came out totally on a high, saying how much we all loved it and want to do it again! Terrific, unusual experience. Defy anyone not to enjoy it."

To this end, there was a computer monitor in the room that would beep at us with a typed hint if we were barking up the wrong tree. Then we were locked in a room to solve puzzles and find clues in order to escape. We had an hour and needed every bit of that, in fact we escaped with just 30 seconds to spare! I purchased this adventure at Hint Hunt for my dad's 62nd birthday for him, my mum, 2 (adult) sisters and me. This has been the best present I've ever bought him. We all had so much solving puzzles and working together, what a fun and memorable evening. We will definitely go back for the 2nd room and I cannot recommend this highly enough. Enjoy."

The pacing was perfect, the puzzles clever and challenging, and the guide (from Hungry where the idea originally came from) was enthusiastic and fun.What we liked about this escape room was that although there were no high tech puzzles, computer generated challenges, or special effects (as there are in time run) everything was decidedly low tech but really carefully considered and well done. We also liked that there was a subtle underlying story behind the challenge.Would recommend!"

Didn't really know what to expect apart from the few reviews I had read........and what a fantastic way to spend an hour!Don't want to give anything away, but a really clever and fun way to spend time with colleagues or friends. Suffice to say it's a puzzle game with the aim of getting out of a room where you have to sleuth around to get clues, keys and generally solve puzzles. The excitement and intensity builds as time runs down and if lucky enough to solve it all, the feeling of relief when you finally get out is great. Recommended!!Got out with 17 seconds to spare too....."

We really loved it and made it out with 32 seconds to spare. Would definitely go back and try the other room next time."

However, after a quick briefing and when the door to our room was locked behind us, the adrenalin started to kick in! As many of the other reviewers have mentioned, it would be unfair to give any details away as it would spoil the experience. Suffice to say an hour can go by VERY quickly indeed and the rush of 'solving' each puzzle and finally solving the mystery with 27 seconds to spare was great. A highly recommend activity to participate in London."

A little imagination allows you and your two, three or four team mates to transport yourself to a fantasy scene, where you are looking to find your way out of a locked room, by finding clues, answering riddles, using keys to unlock hidden gems of information, all with the constant time pressure of the clock counting down from 60 minutes. As the deadline nears the activity becomes more frenetic with new surprises at every corner. Luckily you have the Hint advisor to nudge you in the right direction, when you inevitably stumble in your endeavours. Loved it!!... You need more rooms because I'll be coming back and hopefully this time I'll be out of that room before 00:00"

This was our second live escape room and we absolutely loved our first outing at a different venue and were so looking forward to our second time. But we came away disappointed with the experience at HintHunt - even though we managed to escape. It was just too hard and there would be no way of escaping without the very large number of hints received. And in plenty of cases they weren't hints, they were pretty much telling you the answer. So you just felt as though you were the puppet on the end of a string waiting to be given the next answer by the puppet (games) master and not really having any clue as to what to do in the mean time. After about about half an hour one of the other people playing with me whispered this is so hard and it really was just too difficult for it to be fun with constant directions required as to what to do next (there was no logical way of knowing for yourself in many instances).This might be okay for very experienced live games players with large teams who want a real challenge but it really wasn't much fun for us unfortunately despite our games master being very nice both beforehand and afterwards."

We didn't have any huge expectations, as you can't really find out exactly what you're letting yourself in for, And my advice would be, don't try and find out, it's much better it being a surprise. The game is very well thought out, and it's a great way to work together as a team to figure out the clues, we all had certain things we were better at doing than another so it was fun to divvy out the tasks to the right person to get it done. We managed to get out of the room with 3 minutes to spare, and all came out feeling elated and somewhat hot from an exhilarating and exciting 1 hour! Nice work Hint Hunt! We'll definitely be back to try out the other room one day!Thanks!"

To put it simply, this is a great adventure for those who enjoyed The Crystal Maze back in the day and fancy themselves as the next Sherlock Holmes!It is vital not to learn anything about it before you go in, so along those lines, all you should know is that it is an intense, puzzle based game where you and several friends need to work together to escape the room. That is literally all you need to know!The staff were very friendly and made you feel very engaged with the whole experience, and in terms of the game they can often be too helpful, but I guess that's better than the opposite so can't really fault them.Would definitely recommend"

This time we took on the zen room. The Zen room was very fun and enjoyable, completely different to John Monroes office with different challenges using a completely different kind of skill set. Set up like a Japenese Zen living room that is all i can tell you as i wouldn;t want to ruin the surprise for anyone. We managed to escape with 90 seconds left to spare. This room felt more challenging even though i knew kind of what to expect this time. Hinthunt was my first experience originally of this kind of activity, i have tried two other locations (Escape Live in London and Key Hunter in Birmingham). HintHu by far has been the best of these activities and i cannot wait for them to devise a new room challenge for us to take on. I'd say the actual activity is not great for smaller children you would probably want a couple of adults with teenagers at the youngest. We had an absolut blast and i would recommend this to all my friends."

From reading some of the other reviews, Yes, it is a bit confusing just going into a room and being told little about what it is you are looking for or going to do, but thats all part of the fun! We were a team of two couples and we worked well as a team, which made the experience more fun - so choose your team wisely!!! It was exciting, the puzzles were challenging but fun and hints were only when needed. When we finally escaped we were all buzzing with excitement and chatting about it for the rest of the day. The hour goes fast!This is definitely something a bit different and worth a go if you're someone who grew up watching the crystal maze or enjoy geocaching/treasure hunts."

In my opinion, what would have made it better was a plot. During the hour you solve many puzzles, each of which is used to solve another puzzle, but there was no plot related to the mystery. It felt like a series of puzzles. Even after we got out of the room, we didn't know who the killer was. Also, I think that it is not possible to get out of the room within 1 hour without the hints that the organizers provide throughout the game. Within 3 hours - maybe, if you are good. I would prefer to get more time but less hints. However, overall, it was entertaining and we had a lot of fun."

The whole experience flies- by and is very enjoyable, requiring you to search high and low for clues and split of into teams at points to cover the puzzles in time. If you want to make it put the room in time I would recommend bringing 4 or more people (i think the max is 5) as it lets you divide yourselves between the tasks more efficiently. As this is the first live puzzle escape room I've done, I have a very limited basis for comparison but would recommend it to anyone who likes solving puzzles."

Can't describe it as it would spoil it for others who haven't been yet but it was exceptionally well organised and clean and the staff were really friendly and helpful which was a bonus given that we all needed help at some point. Would definately recommend as somwhere different to go and will definately go back to try the other rooms."

We were on the same wavelength as our coach so hints were well timed and appropriate. Wanted to try this again, but couldn't get in so we tried another one, which wasn't as well done as HintHunt. Very friendly staff. Would definitely go back to try the other themed rooms."

            "review": "Fantastic fun for groups of friends. I visited Hint Hunt yesterday with a group of four friends after someone recommended it to us. The premise is that you're locked in a room with a mystery to solve and a selection of strange clues to find, which hopefully lead to you being able to escape from the room. We managed to get out within the one hour time limit both times - though there were only 19 seconds left on the clock the first time, showing that it's a real challenge. We could easily have lost.The game is balanced by the staff sending you hints tailored to your skill level if you get completely stuck. The hints don't detract from the puzzle-solving at all; in fact, they're often quite funny and add to the tension as the clock ticks down. We met four different staff members on the day we visited and every single one was friendly, supportive and keen to make sure everyone came away with smiles on their faces.We played both of the games on offer. Apparently most people just do one, but I'm glad we decided to try both as they were very different and we turned it into a full day out with a meal in between to discuss strategies! There are actually several copies of each room so if you have a large group you can split up and 'race' the other team(s) for an even more exciting challenge.These 'room escape' games are apparently very popular in Hungary at the moment where it's developed into a major craze. I'd love to see the trend spread across the UK too which is why I'm writing a review to support this one.I highly recommend giving Hint Hunt a try if you're planning a trip to London, you won't be disappointed. Just remember to book well in advance (it's a popular attraction) and be prepared to put your brain to work! We're looking forward to the release of the upcoming third game so that we can all get together and visit again."

The main lobby is very small but you are only in there for a few minutes, maybe 5. The staff was very nice and allowed us to store our carry on bags in the back as we were leaving for the airport later that same day. We were brought downstairs to the room we reserved and given all the instructions. There were four of us. Me, my wife and two teen aged sons. The hour flew by as we scrambled to try and figure out how to get out of the room. The experience was super fun and exciting. I highly recommend this to anyone traveling to London with a group or family. One side note; while we were leaving a couple came in but found out they made reservations on the wrong Tuesday. Since you pre-pay for your reservations they couldn't get a refund. They were told that their reservation would be put back up for sale but if nobody takes it they will lose their money."

As this was our first time trying out 'escape games', we were rather clueless and did not know what to expect. The only thing we knew was we had to solve puzzles to escape the room in 60 minutes. We were really ecstatic when we managed to successfully escape the room within the time given. Brian (Sorry if I spelt your name wrongly!), our 'game master' was incredibly helpful and friendly as well! It was definitely a fantastic experience and hopefully we will be back in the future!"

Time flew past, but the 5 of us had SO much fun and by the end of everything we were still buzzing with energy and adrenaline - we managed to escape with just 40 seconds to spare and when we found out we had done it we couldn't stop squealing and jumping up and down - HA! We did the Zen room, and I wouldn't say it's overly difficult, but it's no walk in the park either. The hints that they give are helpful without being too revealing, and they were timely as well. Honestly, I'd say our team had a bit of an advantage due to our cultural background, but I won't say anything to give it away! Don't let this scare you - everything is very doable - just make sure you have good teamwork and good observation skills!I'd love to go back and try the other room. Overall, this is highly, highly recommended. A bit on the pricey side for an hour's activities, but it's a great group activity and guaranteed to be enjoyed by all!!!!!!!By the way, we were a group of 5 university students - between us we study Law, Mathematics, Chemistry and Nutrition! A very interesting combination! ;)"

My friends and I booked this having read briefly about it in Time Out and not really sure what to expect and it turned out to be one of the best evening's entertainment we had had in a long time. It is better to go in not knowing much so I will be a bit vague but basically you are locked in a room with lots of puzzles, hidden parts and red herrings which you have an hour to solve and make your escape. There's a big countdown clock with your time left as you dash about, trying to solve the mystery. It is very well thought out and put together; they have put a lot of thought into making it fun, challenging but not frustrating and with the player's enjoyment at centre stage. Each team gets a monitor who will give you hints and clues on a TV screen as you play to make sure you don\u2019t waste too long on dead-ends and pointing you in the right direction if you get completely stuck. Doing this gives it the right difficulty balance as the puzzles do require you to think but you also know that you won\u2019t spend the whole hour just completely stuck on the first hurdle. The game remains enjoyable and fast-paced throughout and the monitor\u2019s hints mean that it is tailored to the team\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. Our monitor was an absolute delight and we had a good chat with him before and after the game, he was incredibly friendly, enthusiastic and really made the day extra special. I really can\u2019t recommend this enough; it is an absolute bargain at \u00a317 a person. You feel a real sense of accomplishment afterwards and bonded together as a team. We are already planning our next trip (there are two different scenarios you can do though) and thinking through our team tactics! Check out Hint Hunt, you definitely won\u2019t be disappointed."

Throughout the hour you receive occasional 'hints' on a screen, and for me this was the only disappointment, it felt a little like, even if you escape, you kind of cheated. I don't believe it was just because we were rubbish, I think it's kind of part of the game (as apparently no1 has ever got out without needing them). Having said this, the rest of our group didn't seem bothered by it, and if guess it would need to be a 3h+ game without, which would be crazy, and even then if guess hardly anyone would get out, so it's probably right.

HintHunt was the complete opposite - what a brilliant thing to do.The hour in which you have to solve the clues inside the room to escape it goes by incredibly quickly, and you really don't have a second to lose. Our host kept sending through hints, and we really would never have finished without her. In the end we got out in about 58 minutes!I can't wait to go back and do another room. There's no wonder it gets booked up so early.The only suggestion I had would have for improvement would be to sell drinks and snacks - we had no energy left when we eventually escaped the room..."

Rapidly this became best family we have done in recent years and was great team exercise for us as a family. We did the \"office\" lots of hidden codes and clues , secret compartments etc... We almost cracked it but ran out of time after an hour. Kids are very keen to go again and do the other room....... Excellent"

When we arrived, we had a personalised briefing at the start which was great and the staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Our friend was a bit late, but the staff were happy for us to delay the game a little bit so they could still participate. Once we were in the room, it was an hour of pure adrenaline, we felt like spies. I'm happy it was quite challenging, but we managed to finish within the hour. At the end, the staff took the time to chat to us, see what we thought about the game and take pictures for us. Great experience, we'll definitely be back to try out the other room."

For a start, the room we were in involved no logic or reasoning, merely functional eyes and ears and limbs. The main activity was simply physically looking for clues. The actual aim of the game was also very poorly explained. As far as we could tell, the goal was to solve a crime. Not the case at all. In fact, all you do is look for information that the hints tell you and then input it into certain places. I had hoped for something more intellectually stimulating and a bit less rudimentary. Also completely unsuitable for anyone with an eyesight issue or physical disability. I realise this may seem like a minor complaint, but I think it is a slight shame. The time length is a bit odd. I understand the aim is not that everyone finishes, and clearly many enjoy the experience without finishing, but there is a sense of incompleteness. Even when he end was explained to us it made almost no logical sense, and didn't resolve the mystery we'd started off with. I think if you understand fully the kind of experience it is then it is enjoyable. For the price though, there are many alternate London experiences. My favoutite London spot is the V&A museum, which is also free!"

If you're looking for something different to do this is definitely well worth a go. We went as a trio and managed to escape with 4 seconds to spare. The more the merrier I suppose but too many would mean you'd all be tripping over each other and you might miss that one vital clue that will help you escape."

Once there we were greeted by the lovely members of HintHunt who let us know what we were going to be doing. We had no expectations from the minute we entered, but as you walk into your escape room you feel a sense of eeriness and claustrophobia, and as soon as the 60 minute timer began all senses disappeared and our detective skills came into play. It was an amazing experience where teamwork is a necessity and also how the game is so clever that it kept everyone engaged the whole time. Well worth the trip and looking forward to anymore new rooms you may have coming soon."

We were briefed in detail before we went in, everything was explained perfectly and when the door was locked behind us we were keen to get going. Before heading in we were told that only 50% of groups actually get out of the room before the 60 minutes is up... which just made us even more hungry to do it! I won't give away anything at all about what awaits you in the room, other than you have the time ticking down and occasionally are given clues by the member of staff outside (Who was great!). I have to say, without the clues I don't think it would be possible for anyone to finish this room within a day, but the staff member did say that they made it so that clues were necessary. Towards the end of the hour the clues were coming in thick and fast and it did mean we didn't really have time to process one clue before the next was given, but we didn't care too much as we were out and with 3 minutes 6 seconds to go! It's now Tuesday and I don't think an hour has gone past without one of our group talking about a specific element, or what we did well/what we didn't do so well! There are so many different stages to the game that it's hard to not dissect it all when you come out. Please go and do this, it's really great fun, we can't wait to go back and try our hand at the Japanese 'Zen' room next time. I only hope they develop some new rooms in the future so we can keep going back!"

Since we had such a large group we actually split into 5 groups which all competed for the best time! Our group won with 1 minute and 7 seconds remaining on the clock! I don't want to say too much as I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, but we had a great time solving the puzzles! You definitely need to bring your thinking cap, because you will use it! This activity helped bring our whole group closer together as you quickly learn everyone's strengths and weaknesses! The staff was very friendly and they are just as much fun as the game itself!

It was such a different thing for us to do and we really enjoyed working out the various puzzles within the hour - none of which are straightforward. The \"hints\" that came in via the tv monitor from time to time were really useful when we seemed to be hitting a blank - not telling - but just nudging a bit in the right direction.Unfortunately the other team beat mine but we then spent the next couple of hours over a drink discussing how we solved each clue - Would highly recommend for a team building event."

Went there with 3 friends as my birthday present, and this HintHunt game has been one of the best gifts I have ever received IN MY LIFE! We did the JM's office game, and it was more than just a game. Really good place to practically using my brain. The experience of it is completely new and unique - before going to the venue, my friends and I discussed about how the game was inspired and what we should prepare, but when we later on played the game in real persons with friends, is was much more than we ever expected. The levels of FUN and SATISFACTION from online games are far far beyond reaching the HintHunt games giving me/us (i.e. Fun level of HintHunt: full marks, online games are nothing) ! Moreover, the game is more than just a game: surprisingly, the game even allows me to know more about the strengths of myself and my friends, that we can see that we are in good team work, too, apart of being good friends. :) Prior to the game started, Gloria, the Game-master, was very professionally funny and friendly. She welcomed us to ask any questions to ensure that we were all familiar with how the game worked and what we should do to complete the tasks. During the game she was also very nice and patient to guide us even though that we might find the hints a bit too slowly lol. Her help and guidance indeed gave us more delight about the JM's office room game.About the design of the game, I would just love to say how amazing the details for the set up of the rooms could be. After the game ended, me and my friends just kept sharing about how fun it was and I kept laughing at myself of paying attentions to some \"hints\" but actually not relevant, and how proud we were to sort out the hints together. Overall to say, the game was really inspiring, challenging but so fun to overcome with. I could not imagine how satisfied I was when finishing the game. Atmosphere, therefore, was very well created there! I'd actually give the game 10 out of the 5, even though 5 is a limit!Highly recommend to play in a group of 4 to 5. Can be purely for fun and I reckon it is also very good for corporates to book HintHunt as a team-building activity. Me and my friends truly look forward to having fun once again but in Zen's room and the new one coming soon in November! Can't wait! Thanks to HintHunt and especially to Gloria!"

This was a big family trip to Europe, with London being the first stop (and the first time to London for all three of our kids, aged 18, 14, and 12). There are so many reviews and details about this place already written that I won't repeat them again ---- suffice it to say that our kids voted this their favorite activity in London (and we saw/did quite a bit over four days), and definitely one of their favorites from the whole trip (which also covered Munich, Tuscany, and Venice). It's a great family activity, especially for those who enjoy puzzles and mysteries -- even our youngest could help because she noticed some things that we overlooked. We made it out with just a minute or so to spare, and we had to rely on a lot of clues -- but it was really fun and doesn't take too much time from other sight-seeing. We enjoyed it so much that we did a similar activity in Munich. We hope they will expand to the U.S. soon!"

Trying to find clues and keys and figure out codes for locks to escape was great fun.We went as a team of 3 and managed to escape just in time. I thought I might find the experience claustrophobic but within about 10 seconds of being locked in I had forgotten all about that and was engrossed in looking for clues and hidden objects!Anyone who enjoys puzzles and games will love this place."

Being given the chance to experience the extensive range of human emotions in the space of an hour (and about 9 square meters) is not something that I'd enjoy doing but with HintHunt I would be inclined to go through this roller-coaster again. My partner and I did this with her parents......not that I'd suggest being tested like that.The thrill of achieving a goal without the assistance is great but getting assistance is a must as initially everything is so overwhelming you think that everything is a clue. With a group the clues are spaced out for everybody to have a go at solving the puzzle. We did not escape in time and honestly I had never been so frustrated. Luckily we were all able to laugh about it but I'd be itching to go back and give another a go."

We arrived and were briefed by a incredibly nice staff and started our session. I will not spoil anything related to the story, you must find out for yourself. We escaped with 4 seconds to spare after a mad dash to the finish. The mystery was well thought out and had a few GREAT twists. I swear, this is the FASTEST way to pass an hour in existence. For people thinking that the staff butters people to give good reviews, you are wrong on every level. Book a few months in advance and be there a little early. Also, EVERYBODY MUST go to the bathroom just before or risk a catastrophic bladder emergency from which there is no escape until you run out of time, or the mystery is solved."

It was good to get a walk through debriefing of what we had left. We're all interested in doing something like that again! Definitely recommend."

The room was hard - we solved it only with 7 seconds to spare, and got a lot of clues towards the end. It whet our appetite for doing more of these, and we immediately tried to re-book but couldn't so, we had to try another company's escape room. This was by far more professional and exciting, but again, very difficult!"

There were plenty of hints to keep us going when we were running down some blind alleys!We escaped with 13 seconds to spare!A great way to spend an hour or so when you're in London!!"

For this experience we came to the game late, therfore we were to push the whole schedule behind because the day was fully booked. I guess the hint hunt person that was with us wanted us to not be any more late, thus giving us so many helping hints in order for us to finish... Bottom line is we only really solved the first third of the game and the rest was following instructions.. Still love the game, and would recommend it to people :)"

We visited Camden Market(our favourite market in London) in the morning and for lunch, which is close by. So this turned out great- visit the market and then head to HintHunt. If we return to London- we would return to HintHunt for the second room. My only tip is- it can be hard to book a room- they fill up fast and you seem to need a paypal account- so make sure you have that handy when you go online to book your time. ."

We had scheduled the Warner Brothers Studio Tour leaving Euston station on the train for WJ. As I was looking around on TA, I saw reports for HintHunt and had to see what it was all about. Well...part of the mystery is you really can't know what it is all about until you get there. But, it sounded like a fun way to combine two things into one. The office of HintHunt is only a few blocks from the Euston station, so we arrived in the morning and did a noon appointment at HH. Then, walked back and got on the train for WJ to do the Harry Potter tour. This was a GREAT way to spend the day. The HintHunt adventure was so unique and so much fun...we all said we would like to do it again! How long will it be until someone opens up a HH or something similar in the US? The facility was easy to find and the staff was wonderful. I would highly recommend this for families. And, i can see the team-building aspect would be great for companies or schools.

This game is truly a lot of fun, but it does leave you on a mixed note if you don't solve it (as was the case for us). Although, we were told at the outset that only about half do solve it (despite the impression one might get from the reviews here), so I would not say we were disappointed, just left on less of a high. I wonder what the success percentage is for first-timers; I suspect that even scrambling up the room, it's good to have played this once before to solve it. As a small critique--I don't think I'm giving anything away (it's obvious from some other reviews anyway, and you're told at the outset) that the \"hint\" part is as important as the \"hunt\" part. [There is absolutely *no* way this is solvable in an hour without the hints, but on the other hand they actually add to the game play.] This might be a bit of a problem, since the complexity of the puzzle may lead players to rely a little too much on the hints after awhile; this was the case for us, I think. Also, in our case there was a little real world drama outside that, because of a lack of soundproofing, we took to be part of the game for a bit.Given all this, I'd still play it again if I had the chance."

Started well, but the biggest disappointment was that we did not manage to finish - I had got the impression from other reviews that almost everyone did complete with a bit of help if needed, but we were about 10 mins short, despite supposedly being well ahead at half time. We did get hints from the briefer/watcher, but didn't always understand what she was saying. Far from departing on a high, we left feeling rather depressed at our inability to finish when so many reviews indicate most people succeed - and we're actually quite good at crosswords and puzzles, and are keen quiz participants. When discussing the high points of our London trip, Hinthunt doesn't even make our top 10 (rather surprisingly Globe Theatre performance was much more memorable and enthusiastically received by our teens)."

After reading all the twitter reviews too, everyone was saying it's amazing. However, there aren't many clues as to what lies in the room and I think this is the best way! This is a live escape game but feels more like you've stepped into the Crystal Maze and chosen an hour long 'mystery'. I went with my mum, brother and boyfriend and we all found it really fun. We all found lots of clues between us and when you're struggling, a hint will spring up on the screen to help out. The timer ticking down adds some pressure, but it's all fun and doesn't feel too stressful.The actual venue is super easy to find, it's just down the road from Euston station. Theres a pub next door if you get there too early (we were a bit too eager I think!). The staff at Hinthunt were lovely and explained everything clearly. They were also fun to talk to, sounded like they really liked working there. I'd love to have that job! Nothing was too physical, it was a bit of a mental challenge but there are hints to help you if you get too stuck. We made it out with 40 seconds to go!Overall, I'd certainly recommend Hinthunt, if you love a good puzzle and enjoy detective or mystery games, book now! It really was awesome and worth every penny."

We were looking for an activity to spend an afternoon with our two 20 something children who live in London. HintHunt was an excellent choice. First, we are puzzle people and love board games, computer games, challenges, etc. Second, we were eager for an activity which we could all do together which was fun. Third, we were not looking for something that was necessarily appealing to tourists. We lucked out and got an opening on a weekend with 2 days advance notice. The activity was much as we had expected from the description on line. All 4 of us (parents in their 50's and kids in their 20's) loved this challenge. We worked together on different puzzles and kept our cool. It was really, really tough. You need codes to break codes to find answers to questions which guides you to the next challenge. There is a stress level to keep going, to find new clues, to put things together, it is mental, but at times it feels like a physical challenge. In the end we were successful and opened the door of the Zen room. This is a terrific activity for adults. I would not recommend it for any children under 16 years of age, it is just too difficult and too long. It is pricey but so original, we didn't think it was overpriced. This is not a 'London' activity. It could be done anywhere in the world. It is a family or friends activity for adults and/or older teens. We loved it."

There were about 18 of us split across 4 rooms and after a 10 minute briefing we entered the room and started looking at the various clues in the room trying to understand the relevance of the evidence that lay before us. There is lots to look at and it requires a calm concerted effort to get to the bottom of the mystery with a few red herrings thrown in for good measure and some clues relayed to the room via a television when the team is going in completely the wrong direction.This really is a good team work task, it requires various skills (none of them are physical) and different approaches to succeed and being just one hour- it is long enough to feel worthwhile/a challenge and short enough to keep everyone engaged- unlike so many corporate away days. Personally, I feel this was a great investment- good value for money and thoroughly enjoyed by all my colleagues!"

It was great fun, a good challenge that was hard enough to need a few hints, but not so hard that we didn't complete the room. Only 50% complete it though, so its not easy. Very clever and great fun for a gang of three to five. Going to do another room soon!"

The place itself is very understated and when you get there you do worry you aren't at the right place. I also started to doubt how much fun it was going to be. But once it got going it was so exciting, and really interesting to see how your friends work together when under time pressure. We were all surprised at how on edge we were, wanting to get it finished! We will certainly be going back. The only downside is it is so popular it is impossible to get a weekend slot unless you book months in advance."

The one problem I have with it is that was I have done the two different rooms there I wouldnt be able to do it again and again they need to expand and have more rooms I will definitely be back to have a crack at the other room.

I don't want to give too much away but basically you have an hour to get out of a room to by solving puzzles and clues.

Breaking codes, finding secret objects, following hints - all with a clock counting down towards zero. We solved it just in time. The kids - 13 and 9 - were better at it than the adults. I agree that four people is an ideal number.Can't say much more without spoiling it but worth every penny."

Even though we failed to escape :D You get locked into the room for one hour and have to try and escape... everything from hidden keys, codes to decipher, sudoku, robots and more. It's impossible not to get really invested and forget the time is flying.Really easy to find too, it's only about 2 minutes walk from Euston (and afterwards you're only ten minutes from Camden - bonus!)"

No seriously this is my only 5 star review of the whole trip. My wife and I walked in last minute, they happened to have an opening, they told us the cost (gasp) and we had to see what all the fuss was about!!! IT WAS THE BEST PART OF LONDON! NO SERIOUSLY! I hate giving 5 starts cause that means things are the best they can possibly be, I usually see one or two areas that could be improved... no this was PERFECT! AND CRAZY FUN. 6 months since the trip and my wife and I still catch ourselves reliving that day, with HINT HUNT! Nothing else from the dancing to the sights have we received this long lasting joy!"

It's mental rather than physical but it's different and something great to do with friends.

It was a great fun and I enjoyed it so much!The idea of the game sounds very simple: 2 to 6 people get locked into the room and they need to get out resolving some puzzles. The time is limited to 1 hour.Basically when you enter the room you have no idea what are you looking for, but soon you realise that room is full of locked boxes, coded lockers etc. And you just literally need to open all of them to get out of the room on time. Just search everywhere and bring all bits and pieces together to resolve puzzles, to create codes. Once you stuck with the puzzle, the hint will be given on screen. It is impossible to resolve it without the hints anyway.It was 5 of us in the team and I think it is a perfect number of people to complete it. The staff is really friendly and helpful"

My husband and I went with a couple of friends which is the optimum amount to play this game, although you can have up to 5 people play. The premis is very simple in that all you have to do is get out of the room before your hour is up. There are clues, keys and codes to find along the way and live hints to help you out. We managed to get out with 32 seconds to spare so it made for a frantic finish and great sense of achievement once the door opened. We are already planning our next visit as we had such a fantastic time. This is one of the most enjoyable and original things that I have ever done and would highly recommend it to anyone."

Looking at the concept on the website I thought I would give it a go. Originally was sceptical about the price but the reviews were so good that I thought why not. Hint Hunt is a 3min walk away from Euston station so very easy to get to.Walked into the building and was a bit shocked to see a room of chairs rather than a desk, seemed a bit weird. Was greeted by staff & we quickly were explained the challenge ahead. Straight away my group were hooked on the idea and couldn't wait to start. I don't want to give away too much about the actual experience, but it reminded us of Crystal maze & krypton factor. The booking was for 60mins, but this didn't include the introduction etc so we was there for a bit longer. I booked 2 rooms as I had a group of 7, split into 2 groups. We didn't manage to finish the task, but both groups came out excited at what they had just took part in. It was an amazing experience that really surpassed all of my expectations & was a big highlight of the Stag Do.I highly recommend it, the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable to the point where they didn't give away too much. It's a great concept, looking forward to going again and wish they have 20 rooms!!"

This did not disappoint! Easy location near Euston station and only a few minutes walk away. The girl who welcomed us and briefed us on what to do was very pleasant and approachable. The whole experience was brilliant and the time in the room trying to figure out the mystery flew by! Exhilarating and exciting we weren't bored for a minute. We tried the original room - John Monroe's office which was great and since we didn't quite make it out in time we were glad we didn't book the more difficult room. Even though that we were disappointed that we didn't figure the mystery out in time we loved the challenge anyway.Would recommend HintHunt to anyone and everyone, great for adults, kids and teens. Don't think we'll ever do an activity as unique and cleverly thought out again - a real brilliant one off!! It is pricey but worth every penny for such a good experience."

Our family of five - 2 adults and three children ages 10, 12 and 15 were very excited to experience Hint Hunt for a night of entertainment. As we wanted it to be a complete surprise, we did not search on-line on how to win the game. Arriving at Euston Station, the street where Hint Hunt is located is not super desirable. The signs are peeling on Hint Hunt and we weren't sure if we were being scammed. As we arrived early, we knocked on a locked door and was told we were in the correct location. Our guide for the program was very friendly, but the information she shared was extremely limited. She did say that only 50% of the people make it out in time, which was surprising since it seems the far majority of reviewers made it out. There is no mention of how extensive this riddle is so it is hard to pace yourself and it is hard to see the big picture when there are so many little obstacles. With the recommendation being to check behind the other person, it was hard to move forward fast enough. With some things needing to be roughly moved and others needing gentle touch, it was challenging to understand how much to respect the Hint Hunt property. It also would have been nice to have some sort of ability to hang the items collected so it could stay somewhat organized. The concept is clever and the kids did enjoy the experience. For the adults, it was a lot of pressure to accomplish the task. Unfortunately we didn't make it out in time so while we thought it was interesting, we didn't walk away feeling like it was a wonderful night for the money."

Hinthunt is a very fresh, new game/challenge that you have to complete in 60 minutes. I know the reviews on this have been a bit vague, but after having completed the game, I understand why. You want to go into the game with very little knowledge, except that you will be working together to find things and solve puzzles. It will ALL make sense once you set foot in that room - and they do a GREAT job at explaining things beforehand. Our family of 4, with 2 young teen boys, LOVED it! We solved it with 7 seconds (7 SECONDS!) to spare! It was SO much fun! There is a Hinthunt in Paris too which we tried to book last minute but it was fully booked. BOOK EARLY! Thanks, Hinthunt.

These two places are perhaps the first to live and die by Tripadvisor...they don't advertise, they just rely on users going along, having a good time, and then sharing their experience online.As a result, it's easy to think there's some scam going on...but these escape games are rather like entering a movie where you're the star and you interact with all the finest props.They are hopelessly addictive. But in order to ensure no 'hints' are given, reviews have to be rather scant in detail. You wouldn't thank me for revealing any details. Half the fun is it's all completely fresh.For the uninitiated, all you can say is these are a new breed of 'escape games' - you and up to four of your pals or family are locked in a room and you have to solve a series of puzzles to enable you to escape.Sounds potentially a bit earnest, but is actually rather thrilling.And I wouldn't really want to say any more than that.The two big players in London are HintHunt and ClueQuest - and we've now done both.HintHunt is, for this review really is about our trip here, excellently done. The room is well structured, the puzzles extremely well done. The staff are friendly. The location is very handy when exiting Euston station (about a three minute walk away).It is, however, not quite as polished as ClueQuest which, having recently moved into new offices, seems just a little more rounded as an experience. The briefing at ClueQuest is a bit more engaging and the space and facilities there make it a little more fuller.However, that is the frill to the main event - and, in truth, the two are so close for there to be next to no difference.Both are excellent fun.At some point these things are going to explode across the country. For now, enjoy them and the quality they bring.There are cheaper things to do, but your hour flies by at an incredible rate - and when it finishes you'll immediately want to do it again. A sure sign of a quality attraction.HintHunt is excellent....ditto ClueQuest...either will deliver great value."

I don't want to go into too much detail otherwise it will spoil the fun, but basically in groups of 3 - 5 you have 1 hour to get out of a locked room. There were 15 of us in total in 3 identical rooms, 2 teams got out in time and the 3rd failed.There is a great mixture of clues, brain teasers and twists. They have 1 different room so we can't wait to go back again and have a go at this.Location-wise they are a 5 minute walk from Euston train station so it's brilliant."

If you are like me, clutching for straws for days out (other than eating!) when you have teenagers - this is absolutely fantastic. I don't want to give too much away but you basically communicate and pull together as one to get you way out of a room. You will be surprised how your children think so calmly and practically. We managed to solve it with literally a few minutes to spare and the help of our very kind \"hinter\" who was watching us by a hidden camera all the time. We can't wait to do visit again in the other room."

We all really enjoyed the experience and then had plenty to talk about through dinner !Apparently the escape rate for the Monroe Office is only 50%. Even less for the Zen room. We were given 2 minutes extra, as we were so close, and therefore did escape in one hour and 89 seconds. Not sure if that means we are truly entitled to claim victory or not !The cost seems a bit expensive, but you have to have the undivided attention of a member of staff throughout, so I think it's warranted.This activity is not particularly aimed at or of interest to tourists, but certainly is a good choice if you're used to going out in London and just want to try something a bit different. My 17 year old daughter is very keen to have a try, and it would certainly suit her and a few friends for an evening out.Good fun !"

Friendly staff greet and give you a brief introduction, before you are let into your room (in our case John Monroe's Office). You have an hour to solve the mystery and escape. Whilst I won't say too much to ensure the mystery is preserved, this was challenging enough to ensure a good time, and great fun, I would recommend to anyone who wants n exciting (sometimes frantic when the timer is ticking down) way to spend an hour.Having read the high praise on here I was somewhat underwhelmed by the unassuming nature of the building exterior, but don't be fooled, the warm welcome and the thoroughly enjoyably hour we spent escaping (and yes, we did get out in time!) more than warrant the reviews."

We ended up in the Zen room which we were told has a 40% success rate with a quickest time of 53 mins to escape from.Being a competitive bunch we were eager to complete it and do it in the quickest time ever. The trick is to work as a team and to communicate. Our host was Tibi and he was fantastic. He explained in brief what would happen and how it all worked. He can see your every move via CCTV and provided some valuable hints when we overlooked something or had dismissed an item. We had all 4 of us look at one item and missed a vital clue! It's a mixture of skill, brain power and reasoning whilst being up against the clock. Did we get out in record time? No. But we did get out, and that's more than enough for us because its not as easy as it first seems. For obvious reasons what really goes on inside the rooms has to remain hush-hush. But this is a fantastic way to spend an hour and I cant recommend it enough. We fully intend to go back and try our luck in the other room."

Our family of 5 (kids aged 12, 20 and 23) were all able to actively participate and contribute to us solving the Zen Room in just under 57 minutes. quite a rush! The clues are tough and there is no way you can solve the entire thing without some hints, but success is definitely dependent on your observation and creative problem solving.The website says you can do this with 3 people, but i think it would be tough within the 60 minute time limit. With 5 people, most of us were engaged in something most of the time and we could let someone stay engaged with one puzzle without distracting them for something else. 4 people would work too.HintHunt is easy to get to, across the street from Euston rail station. The staff was very friendly. (Note, there is a nice pub next door for cleansing ale after you finish, too.)"

We were looking for something different to do in London and given the recent ratings of this on tripadvisor we decided to give it a go.Four of us and one child (aged 9) enjoyed an hour searching, talking, arguing, laughing and trying to escape the locked room together.For me it wasn't a five star experience because some of the clues are just too abstract. If it wasn't for the guide giving hints through the TV screen then I doubt if any team would get out in an hour . For example, who would ever think of adding the suspects ages together to get a code. There are quite a few things like this and some of the clues are so well hidden that again you could probably spend all day there and not spot them.However, we thoroughly enjoyed it, it's something different and I would recommend a visit."

Playing with a bunch of highly intelligent maths teachers who loving problem solving, I was worried that either the puzzles would be too easy, or frustratingly illogical, or requiring random knowledge and luck. I should not have worried. Let me reassure anyone who is likewise worried that this is suitably challenging without needing intellectual or much in the way of mathematical problem solving. The most important thing is being observant and working well as a team.Hints are fed into the teams to keep them working at a constantly fast, enjoyable pace and keep them from getting frustrated. It was nice to come close to beating what we were told was the record (53mins. Out Time:54mins 29 secs), and being complimented as being one of the best teams our observer had seen. How much truth there is to that, I don't know. I like to believe that it was. We were told that only half the teams made it out in the hour. Our other two teams (of five) both made it out with less than half a minute.Highly recommended as a team building exercise, for communication and a lot of fun for problem solvers of any level."

Some say it feels like more than an hour and others say that it goes in really quick. I think it depends on how many people you have in the team. We thought it went in really quickly and hit dead ends a few times but the lovely camera watchers were never too far away to offer us some much needed help.We solved a fair few clues to start with (and there are plenty of them) and I remember getting to the point halfway through thinking that we must be so close to completing the game only to discover even more clues that kept us scratching our heads on more than one occasion!There are a good deal of puzzles to solve with varying degrees of difficulty. One puzzle in particular had made us all wish we had listened a little more in class (ahem).While not wanting to spoil it for anyone interested in participating in this game, I would offer the following tips...Delegate:-Have one person allocated to do the writing on the board - it will fill up pretty quickly so erase what is not required as soon as you can.Strategy:-Work out whose going to do what when you enter the room, examine everything (at least three times), if you find yourself at a loss with a puzzle, swap with someone and you do something else - try and not stay too long with one puzzle - let someone else have a go..."

Have now booked to return and try a different room !!"

This was perfect! My kids are 12 and 14, but this would suit teens and adults alike. This was such good fun from start to finish. The time flies by. You never get bored, and in our opinion we could have been there longer. I can't say too much, but it's a cross between Professor Layton and the Crystal Maze. We will definitely be going back, and I can't recommend it highly enough. Excellent."

Was booked up for a few months so had been looking forward to this for a while.The reception was small and not as swish as I had expected and staff were laid back, as opposed to the more formal I was expecting. Alice was our hinter and was great. She left no stone unturned in the explanation and was very genuine. The game itself was great. It was the right level in being mysterious but achievable, with all sorts of codes and hidden clues. Wish we had half an hour more! But we did it. Will definitely try the zen room. Wish there was more of this kind of activity in London."

You enter a room and have to find clues and solve puzzles, such as finding keys and numerical codes to open several different kinds of locks. People enter a room in small groups and are accompanied by an \"angel\", who explains how the room works, the goal, and keeps providing clues to the group on demand, through a monitor, and sometimes with pictures! In our case, we were lucky and the instructor was nice, with a bit of eastern-europe accent. By the way, this is the type of attraction you should go only if you are reasonably knowledgeable in english; otherwise, the task will become impossible and you will miss most of the fun. We spoke english all the time, and this allowed the instructor to understand our ideas and provide better clues.I wish there were several other, different rooms, and also a different style of play, with more time to finish, like having 2h for the price of 1.5. Then the challenge becomes not only being able to finish, but also in a shorter time."

This was a great addition to our trip, so many of the great attractions in London are \"stand and look at it\" it was great to mix it up with something so active. I had a hard time picking a category of visit to put it in, it would be great with just about anyone. What happens (without giving away too much!) is you're locked in a room and have to find various clues, items, numbers, and letters hidden in, around, and on different objects. The room is filled with locked drawers, boxes, and cabinets that you have to get creative to figure out how to open! We did the Zen room and were just barely able to finish it. There is a person watching you on CCTV throughout the game and at the end you can ask questions about what you missed, where you spent too much time, etc. One piece of strategy advice: They will tell you in the beginning that each code (alpha or numeric) only opens one thing. Keep track of these on the whiteboard provided to you- You might find a code in minute 5 that opens something you find in minute 40!"

The location, though convenient, isn't super flashy; the staff are very friendly although also quite laid back which can work for and against a visitor attraction; the waiting area is really quite small and doesn't give you a particularly marvellous initial impression of the attraction. However, as one discovers during the experience itself, things are not always as they appear on the surface!The lady who explained everything to us was very friendly and personable as well as being informative about what we needed to know plus health and safety aspects including a friendly but sufficiently firm request not to vandalise the room in our quest for answers, and very soon we had started our HintHunting experience. Even once we had begun, any interaction we had with staff managed to follow through on the friendly tone which was very cool - it felt like they were engaging with us as a group. The facilities were good (understandably a little dogged) and the puzzles were very clever. It definitely appealed to my logical brainz and I can't wait for the opportunity to come back for the next level.The price is more than reasonable for the value you get in the experience, especially as the experience continues once you leave - discussing it and thinking about it. Great fun overall, thanks HintHunt!"

We cannot wait for them to create more rooms and opportunities.

You are locked in a room for an hour with a clock counting down for you to escape. You have to find codes and solve the murder mystery. It is quite ingenious! You have to work as a team and communication and creativity are the keys.A facilitator sits outside the rooms you are locked in and watches you on cameras and listens in to your attempt to get out. They sometimes provide hints for you on a TV screen which help you solve the puzzles.We has such a laugh - 1 kept on wandering off with the marker pen that you use to record things on your white board - drove my family mad!This isn't a cheap hour, but for between 3 and 5 people you can have a unforgettable time together.

I could only get reservations for the last day, which worked great since we had seen most of the touristy things already. Really had no idea what to expect, except for what I saw on trip advisor, but it was fantastic. **note on reservations - originally all time slots were booked on the website, so I put our name on the waiting list and was contacted by Hinthunt within a week that 2 slots had opened up and they gave me the choice. worked great.** Location is very convenient to Euston tube, or 5 min walk to King's Cross or St. Pancreas. Also very close to British Library - good to know for the tourist so you can do multiple things in the day. The game itself was great, simple to understand, but not simple to figure out. We were challenged the whole time. The staff was great, providing helpful clues throughout from a monitor. You are only with the people you came with which was cool. As a family of 4 (46, 44, 18, 15) we had to work together, literally because there is so much stuff to figure out. The pace is somewhat fast, not a lot of sitting around... and again, the staff onitors you from a camera so if you are completely stick they send you a \"hint\" to move in the right direction. Bring an open mind, sharp brain, a little imagination, and fun people for a unique experience. We described it as an interactive Clue game. We walked away so glad we did it and if in London again, would do the other room. "

We'd wanted to do two of the same room between the two teams so that it was more of a direct competition but all that was available for our chosen time and date was one John Monroe's Office and the Zen Room, so we settled for that. Our team took on the Zen Room and, after much frantic thinking, quite a lot of screeching and a few clues, we made it out with almost 4 minutes to spare! (The other team didn't make it out but I don't think they were far off...)It's probably not to absolutely everyone's taste, but honestly it was so much fun and, as plenty of other people have said already, the fastest hour you will ever experience!

The most key skills you'll need will be team work, alertness, and discipline in how you manage all the information you're presented with. Time in the room passes a *lot* quicker than you imagine, and you'll have someone at hand to help point you in the right direction if you're especially stuck. All in all, I'd highly recommend this experience, and can't wait to next try the more challenging Zen room.Special thanks to the wonderful Naomi who guided us through our hunt, without whose help we wouldn't have made it out in time!"

Not really sure what to expect had read the reviews which all seemed good. Location was a bit odd so was a bit sceptical when we arrived as it is a very modest venue and there is nowhere to wait if you arrive more than a few minutes before your booking time. We had to go back to the station for a coffee while we waited. When we went back staff were very welcoming. and all went very well. We booked 2 rooms boys against girls and had an absolute ball. The whole experience is like nothing that we have ever done before..It had been likened to crystal maze also a bit similar to 101 rooms app but totally unique experience Every member of the team got fully involved searching for clues to escape the room. The clues are certainly not easy but you get hints when needed so that the enjoyment is maximised even if you are struggling. We felt very well looked after and even though the boys escaped within the hour and us girls didn't quite make it I would definitely recommend this activity for families with teenage kids or adults. We all laughed so much it was amazing. Really hope that this attraction grows just a little bit as you cant do the same room again so if they get 2 zen rooms we will definitely go back to try them on a boys against girls challenge. Would have been nice for the winners to get prize certificate or something but the boys gloated all day so guess that was enough and you get a group photo posted on Facebook page. It was also quite refreshing to go somewhere that wasn't total commercialism. No coffee bar no gift shop no commercialism just fun whoever thought of this was a genius well done guys will tell all my friends you deserve success"

The kids are getting older now and their interests more diverse so reading the rave reviews we decided that this could be a fun family outing. We weren't disappointed. In two teams, 3 girls against 3 boys, we booked two John Monroe offices, were briefed and locked in and then set about our task of getting out within 60 minutes. In a huge yay to girl power the girls won! However, despite our evidently enormous detective brain capacity and super nous we unfortunately weren't in the 50% that escape the room within the hour. Bear in mind (ego strokingly) that the record for escaping the office is 53 minutes, escape is no simple task. The clues are cryptic and highly occult and the hour flies by. Thank goodness for the helpful screen hints given when necessary. Obviously, as born detectives, my daughters and I didn't need these hints (oh by golly we did need them) but they were provided regularly. A suggestion could be a prize for opposing teams, but to be honest, bragging rights are the best prize. Meeting the boys afterwards we debriefed over an early dinner at gbk and discussed how each team had used the clues and hints and also how these and about our individual team experience. It seems that the two teams, despite their virtually identical locales, had vastly different games. There isn't much I can say in way of advice without giving anything away apart from listen to your briefing before being locked in and do exactly what they say. It's easy to get distracted and forget the advice you're given but as mrs Harry hindsight, I advise you do try to remember and do. Loved it. Book and go, people. Already anticipating a group effort in the zen room whose escape rate is only 40%."

We managed to complete the challenge and escape with 1min 48 sec left on the clock and all agreed that this was no easy challenge - but definitely hugely enjoyable.We were talking about the game for the rest of the evening and cannot wait to return and try our hand at the Zen room. Will definitely recommend to friends and family looking for a unique experience. We don't want to give anything away about the game itself as it would ruin the experience for you, but we would say if you are thinking about booking - do it!"

We were booked into the Zen room which was the hardest one, but we managed to complete it with 30 seconds to go! I would recommend to anyone, except very young kids - our group was 18-50. We are not the sort of family who spend all our time playing puzzle type games, but we found that it was very easy to understand and get involved with. although not easy to complete! Hints are provided to help you reach your goal and it was a really exhilarating experience!"

We went with a couple of friends before an evening out and would highly recommend it!As a previous review says, when you walk through the door to a very small, simple building you wonder what to expect. We booked the Zen room, which is the slightly harder of the two rooms, even though it was our first visit and thoroughly enjoyed it. In short, the night consists of being locked in a small japanese-style room, and finding clues and solving puzzles to get out of the room within 1 hour! The \"host\" sends hints to you on a television screen to guide you if you get stuck. Apparently only 40% of people make it out of the Zen room, but with the help of our host we escaped with time to spare. It was very good fun, a real bonding experience that started an evening out on a real high. The staff were all really friendly and brilliant fun.I would definitely recommend this night to anyone who has fancied a go on crystal maze or similar! Excellent value too."

We made reservations months in advance and unfortunately all the rooms were booked except for the Zen room, which is more difficult than the original room, and this may be some of the reason for our disappointment. I consider us all fairly intelligent people and we came nowhere close to solving the puzzle. At first it was fun but quickly became tiresome and frustrating for everyone. The location was quite far from where we were staying and not close to any other attractions, so this ended up taking a full afternoon of our vacation; we did not find it worth the time and quite a disappointment after all the positive reviews on Tripadvisor. I would recommend it for people who live in London looking for something different to do with friends. For tourists, I would say to spend your time and money at the many other fascinating attractions London has to offer. If you do go, start with the original room."

It lasts an hour and goes by very quickly - you look at the clock and can't believe it's nearly at an end. At the end, we all had a big smile on our faces and I had a real feeling of wonder and exhilaration. The member of staff there to introduce the game was really nice and made us feel welcome (as well as giving us useful hints throughout the game). I would recommend this wholeheartedly - can't wait to go back and do the other room. If you're thinking about going to this - book it now - it's totally worth it."

I was excited at the prospect of HintHunt - whilst London has a lot of well known tourist activities, a lot of great places to eat, a lot of museums, a lot of bars - I'm always on the look out for something that will provide a different experience, something more fun and interactive.If you've ever watched the Crystal Maze and fancied having a go, if you're a fan of playing games, or if you're even the slightest bit competitive, you will love HintHunt. For me the idea is perfection, and the implementation is extremely good too.The basic premise is that you're locked in a room, and you have 60 minutes to try and find a way out. The rooms don't have a massive amount of objects in them, but they really need a thorough search - you might find useful things behind / underneath / inside various props, which can help you open up new areas and progress with the solving of a mystery and progressing towards your eventual escape. They say 50% of teams make it out in time; it's pitched just at the right level of difficulty, it's great fun and very exciting, especially as the deadline approaches - you'll be running around the room trying to put the last few pieces of the puzzle in place!You don't really get stuck for too long either, as the game masters can send you hints on a screen during the game to help things along. These are needed at times (nobody could get out inside an hour without any help), but they're not excessive and a good team will get out in time - a less good team won't!The venue has two different 'mysteries' available - one is duplicated in three rooms (each can take a maximum of 5 people), so groups of up to 15 can be catered for doing the same thing, and then you can have some competition to see who can escape the fastest. There's also a single room with a different mystery in, which is apparently slightly harder.My team completed the classic mystery with a couple of minutes left on the clock, I came out with adrenalin pumping and was sweating just a little from running around inside! And it was so much fun that I came home and immediately booked a return visit to try out the other room - I can't wait to go back!"

This is a totally different, novel attraction. For the first few minutes, you are unsure what you have let yourself in for. But for the rest of the time you become totally immersed in the experience. Don't arrive early - there is limited waiting room. If you are speaking to others who have been there, don't go into detail - you will enjoy it more if you are in the dark. Finally, all the times that I wanted were full about 6 weeks out, but I put my name down on the waiting list, which worked. We thought it was great value. Went for a lovely meal afterwards, and never stopped talking about it. Fabulously different."

The hosts were very welcoming and intriguing. Once the hunt began, there was not a moment of reflection - it's just all a mad dash for clues with collaboration and celebration along the way. We would relish seeing this concept come to NYC and would sign up in a heartbeat with friends. BTW, there's a nice pub just a few doors down where you can grab a pint and relive the experience."

It wasn't bad. The staff were really, really personable and helpful, and the whole activity was well organized. I think it may just not have been the right activity for us. First we went in with a 6, 8, and 10 year old. We thought since the site says you need 3 people to solve the puzzle and it was appropriate for kids over 9 that the other 2 would have fun playing the game but that we'd have our requisite 3. This game is way, way, way too hard for 10 year olds, let alone younger kids. Even when the game was over and everything was explained to us - we still didn't really get it. And then, it didn't really have anything to do with London. The truth is the game could be played anywhere and be exactly the same."

There is I believe a harder version which you can try, if your appetite has been whetted. Really friendly staff, I remember Lazlo's name but the lady in charge of our team was great.

It is very cleverly constructed and demands a high level of logical and lateral thinking. There is also someone on hand to provide hints throughout via a TV screen in the room. The female staff member guiding us was great - she was enthusiastic and engaging. The game is very interactive, the hour flies past, and you certainly have to think outside of the box. We all loved every minute of it, just wish I could forget the clues and do it all over again.All I can say is - I forecast HintHunt expanding across the UK and internationally.

The room was tailored perfectly for the time limit, there's no way you're going to make it out before getting your moneys worth. We got out feeling exhilarated and instantly started planning our return. Can only hope that the popularity continues and that more rooms are added as would love to keep coming back every few months or so.There's nothing overtly 'London' about HintHunt but as it's located right next to Euston train station and takes up around an hour and a half in its entirety it could easily be fitted in to a short visit."

It's suitable for all ages and I recommend you have four people at least as it does get particularly tricky at times. Fortunately the host provides clues to help you if (when!) you get stuck. As others have said, the hour does fly by and you have to keep searching and re-searching. Good luck, you'll need it!"

One of my friends and I had done something similar to this in the past while on holiday in Hungary, and we really looked forward to Hint Hunt after our previous experience.We most certainly were not disappointed :) Without giving away too much, the challenge was stunningly set up, and the tasks just fun fun fun. We were never left feeling frustrated for long as the lovely Hint Hunt staff would drop us subtle hints over the PA system on occassion to help us get back on track when we got stuck (and believe me, you WILL get stuck at times!). We had booked this reasonably last minute - 2 weeks before we went to play. It's hugely popular and rightly so, so I recommend that you book well in advance for this. As it was, we had to play the hardest room, the Zen Room, because of our last minute booking so it was all the more satisfying that we escaped the room with ample time to spare still :)Thank you Hint Hunt for an amazing send off, and I really do hope that you guys are able to set one up in Australia - I can't wait to be the first to line up for a room to escape here in Oz!"

This was the most amazing experience and if you do anything in London make sure this is at the top of your list.... although book early to avoid disappointment!When we arrived we were welcomed by Kitty who looked after us with care and attention the whole time we were there ~ thank you Kitty, you have obviously found your vocation in life and made the event even more enjoyable!!!Difficult to explain the evening as I don't want to give away any spoilers but it was great value for money, jam packed with surprises and utterly good fun. The four of us who attended worked really well as a team and got down to solving clues as soon as the clock started and by the end of it we were all mentally & physically drained yet completely exhilarated... fortunately there is a pizza express just round the corner which we fell into immediately after.Sadly I have to confess we did not manage to break out in the allotted time but we were so damn close, another 60 seconds and we would have cracked it.... arrggghhhh... the hour shot by!Don't take my word for it however... just do it and I promise you, you will not regret it xHintHunt we will be back and hopefully you will still have Kitty working for you... she is a great asset xx"

This was his specific pick for the whole family and I am pleased to have the privilege to report that this was the best fun we had in all of London. While we enjoyed all the cultural attractions of London, and there are many worthy contenders, this activity stood out by a country mile. It was exciting, engaging in every moment and a wonderful learning experience, illustrating the dynamic nature of the bond we share as a family. It was so interesting for all of us to experience how our minds worked on an individual level and a collective one in a time pressured situation. For us, this just brought us closer together and we left the experience on a complete high. While this activity is costly one, it is our recommendation to ignore this completely. In a city that is arguably the most overpriced city in the world, with so many useless tourist trap activities, this experience when compared, is a complete bargain. We also had the opportunity in the short time to develop a relationship with the young attendant who briefed us. Timea only enhanced the overall experience and was a true credit to her company. Thank you Timea! The young entrepreneurs that thought this up are clearly geniuses and we found out that they are actually Hungarians not English. We also learned that they value their workers, which is also why I believe people have such a wonderful experience from start to finish. Clearly there are many reviews of this activity, so in this respect, I am not sure if our review will make any real difference. We will say however, that we believe it is because Hint-Hunt is the full package that it gets such an enthusiastic nod from so many. We nevertheless trust that you will find this review useful too in giving you a slightly different perspective on which to base your decision to go ahead. TIP: If you are considering this for your next trip to London, make sure you book well ahead of time, giving yourself plenty of chance to book a slot that will suit you. Irrespective of season, it seems that they are always booked and we wouldn't want you to miss out.Thank you,Lali & Family"

The only slot available was for the Zen room which is a bit harder than the John Munro room so we were thrown into the deep end. Our host was extremely friendly and really helpful and we escaped with only a few seconds to spare. Didn't give it the full 5 stars because it is quite expensive for one hour of entertainment, also some of the clues are well thumbed and used so sometimes a little hard to read and decipher."

When your 60 minutes begin you neither know what you're looking for nor why you're looking for it or what you'll do with it when you find it. It's designed to get you working as a group and it cant be faulted as a bonding experience. When we finally cracked it with literally seconds left and the door swung open it was a great sense of accomplishment that gave us lots to talk about for the rest of the day. If you like a mystery or a challenge you have to get HintHunt on your London itinerary. Great fun and thoroughly recommended."

When we told him how much fun we'd had, he decided to go with a few mates one evening.If you find yourself in London, please, please visit Hint Hunt. I had a fantastic time and i'm very sure you will too, no matter who you go with.

We were under so much pressure to accomplish the game, we were working up a sweat!We didn't really know what we were getting ourselves into, but had so much fun finding all the clues and trying to solve the mystery. It was adrenaline based, and so much fun. It's difficult to explain the game without giving the 1 hour activity away. It's a great game for all ages (although there probably is a \"too young\" age category). It's fast paced, and the key to success is good communication.The unfortunate thing about Hint Hunt is that once you have completed the 2 different games (Zen room, and John Monroe) you have done Hint Hunt. To go again and repeat a room defeats the purpose, and would be a bit like cheating, but it is possible to do, particularly if you leave a long gap (about a year or so) in between each game.Note that the Zen room and John Monroe room are separate games and need to be booked separately.The venue is easy to find near Euston station. There is a toilet on site. Go play. It's the best hour you'll have. Book well in advance though, as it is very popular!!!!"

By the time we were in the room and getting started, we were all four totally invested. And by the time we were finished, the adrenaline was running so high, and we couldn't believe we had made it through! All four of us agreed it was such a unique, fun experience.Seriously, we finished at 1:30pm and talked about it the entire rest of the day. The only part we were bummed about was that we weren't in London long enough to have a chance to do the second room.It was so much fun; I would highly recommend it to anyone who has ever enjoyed a good mystery story or logic or escape puzzle. Please don't get hung up on the fact that it has nothing to do with London, really; it is the number-1 rated excursion for good reason! Yes, it could be anywhere else in the world, but it isn't. It's in London. And it's totally worth an hour and a half of your time while you're there!!!"

My husband and I are 40-somethings and then there was our 12 year old know-it-all son and our 6 year old daughter, who was pretty much just along for the ride. Oh, and we had to do the harder \"Zen Room\" since that was all that was available when we reserved. So we were doomed from the start...or so we thought!Working together, the three of us (the 6 year old just kind of hung out and watched the craziness) managed to run around like crazed monkeys, shouting clues to each other as the clock ran down and things got increasingly chaotic. Using each of our strengths, which we had determined beforehand (my husband was the puzzle solver, I was the methodical one so I did all the reading and tracking of clues, and the 12 year old was the \"out of box thinker\" -- having someone like this is essential in this game). What's really infuriating and also awesome about this game is that just when you think you're doing well, you realize how far you still have to go! Amazingly, we actually completed the \"Room\" and escaped with literally seconds to spare. I'm not joking when I say we were sweating and so hyped up on adrenaline afterwards that we were recapping all the events in the room for the next 3 hours like deranged mental patients.To sum up, it was some of the most fun we had on our trip and an experience we'll never forget. It's like you're in a TV show, mixed with a game show, mixed with some sort of life or death situation. What can I say but \"wow\"! Loved it! Can't wait for HintHunt Miami (come on, it could happen!)."

This may seem like elementary my dear Watson, but trying to explain just how good Hint Hunt is is tougher than one of Jessica Fletcher's cakes (she probably baked, I can't remember).Crappy detective analogies aside, Hint Hunt is probably the closest thing you'll get to experiencing solving a 20th century TV crime. The premise is simple, you are trapped in a locked-down murder scene with the police on the way; you have an hour to solve the crime before the police arrive and beat a confession out of you (hey, that's what they did in the olden days, right?).Four of us took part in Hint Hunt (five is probably the optimal number) and it was described before we started as \"the fastest hour of your life\"; this really was the fastest hour of my life, as we basically rooted around the 'crime scene', looking for clues, trying to interpret evidence and turning the place over like the marx brothers committing a burglary in a manic attempt to solve the crime and save ourselves from the impending fit-up job.Without giving anything more away it's hard to offer anything else that others haven't already said but it is truly is a great way to spend an hour. The only advice I would give is, if you *think* you might need the loo before you go in, go to the loo before you go in. One of our party foolishly declared himself un-in-need of a wee and after half an hour, was slumped in a chair, offering no help and providing only comedy entertainment with his pained expressions for the girl running the show from outside the room."

I am hoping that the organisers of Hint Hunt keep it fresh and new by adding new rooms or changing the current rooms so that we can go back again. :)"

If you like puzzles, and are good at lateral thinking & problem solving, you will love this. Basically you have to gather as much information as you can from the different objects in a room (turning everything upside down) and are drip fed queues to help you to solve a number of interconnected puzzles which eventually lead you being freed from the room. My group finished with a couple of minutes to spare. The story was okay - although would have been improved by having more of an ending, for example, enabling the customer to solve the crime story, in addition to finding the exit to the room. I also thought the customer amenities could be improved a bit. There was only one toilet, and eight people there when we arrived- so all eight of us ended up taking in turns. Also there was no shop or water or anything - it was all very small and basic. We hailed a taxi here from about a mile away but the driver had never heard of the attraction. It's not well known in London - yet somehow it still always seems to be booked up. Make sure you book well in advance, especially for a weekend visit."

I think this is more something for the locals to check out or maybe a fun event if you've been to London many times and are looking for something totally different and non-touristy.For Londoners who love a murder mystery this is a great thing to do. Get a group of friends together and have a crack, get a few groups together and play in separate rooms at the same time and then go to the pub to compare notes afterwards (as we did), or use it as a team building work exercise.I thought it was really well organised, was different to anything else I'd ever done and I'd definitely recommend it to my friends."

Basically, we were a group of two, which is really too small - far better would have been three or four, but they explained it was possible to get a lot out of the game - even if you don't solve the crime. They will increase the clues to accommodate the lack of players and I can say we still talk about our experiences in the \"locked room\".I found out a lot about how my grandson thinks under pressure and I was impressed.

The clues are hard enough for you to work your ares (and brain) off but not so hard that it's impossible. The staff are incredibly nice and are clearly proud of their company and were just as excited as we were, their energy was great. Even when we got out (with 93 seconds to spare!!!) and were bursting with excitement, our games master, with big dreamy eyes, dark hair and sexy stubble, was just as thrilled that we got out in time!

More than two are ideal (especially tackling the more challenging room), but if I had to do it again, under the same circumstances, I would. We had a blast! A very unique experience. A little tip - book this when you're at your sharpest mentally - you need to be \"on\" - this is a great brain workout.

We broke up into 2 groups-one of adults and one of teenagers. We all had a wonderful time. It was all that we hoped for when we read the reviews. I don't want to say to much to ruin the surprise for you, but I do believe that they can tailor this for different age groups. Both of our groups were very competitive, and the kids ended up winning much to the parents dismay! We all loved it!!! This is a must see when you are in London. Don't be put off by the outside or the neighborhood. We did have a drink first at a nearby neighborhood pub.Also, make sure that you make reservations early. We booked ours one month in advance. Many of the spots were filling up early."

I am glad to see the service is still very friendly and efficient and the second room is just as fun as the first. All my friends enjoyed it just as much as I did and look forward to going back to the room they didnt do the first time around.Quite expensive, but when you consider the full time role required to run the room you can see why, with 4 people it isnt too bad and I think it is worth it.Do it!"

Our \"kids\" are now 21 and 17 so we were looking for activities that all of us could enjoy doing together. We had to book a session well in advance so you need to be organised! Was interesting and challenging for all, plenty of laughs but also brought out our competitive side as we were told that only 50% teams complete the challenge within the 1 hour allocated (you do get additional clues and assistance if it looks like you are struggling so I'm not sure if it is true that only half of people succeed) - there is a big countdown clock in the room and you will not believe how quickly 60 minutes can pass!Thoroughly recommend for groups of friends or families with older kids. We would certainly plan to include another visit for the follow up scenario when we next visit London."

We were 2 adults and 1 teen and all 3 of us really enjoyed ourselves. We most likely would have gotten further along with another player.Tips: 1) reconsider coming right off a red eye-- lack of sleep might make the puzzling harder, and could make the player interactions more stressful. We went rested and were happy we did. 2) although you need to work together to solve the puzzle, everyone can focus on different areas."

Am I glad i chose to go to HIntHunt instead. What an amazing way to spend an hour in London. Very close to Waterloo station, with a nice pub next door for a little pre-drink before going in (just did not know what to expect!)We were a family of 4 (with 2 children 10 and 8). Our host talked us through what would happen. Little tip here - if you do have children, staff ask a number of times if you need the toilet before you go in, if you have children TAKE THEM IN even if they say they don't want to go. My son (8) needed to go after being in the room about 15 mins, i didn't think he would be allowed out of the room - host said later that he could have come out of the room to use the toilet!!The game surpassed all my expectations, we didn't solve it. My daughter (10) was brilliant and like the hosts said, great game to play with children as children will search in places that adults wouldn't look and they were right.The hour passes so quickly and the music builds at the end and you feel the panic set in.Book, book, book this - you will not regret it. We will defintely be booking again when we come back to London next year."

We escaped with 15 seconds to spare but only because, by that stage, the hints had to be so blatant we were pretty much being given the answers. It is a novel experience so we're happy to recommend it but, if your time in London is short don't do it at the expense of some of the \"proper\" London attractions.It wouldn't be suitable for very young children, people in wheelchairs, or people who don't speak any English."

My youngest daughter in particular absolutely loved it and was buzzing afterwards and has since been trying to find x-box games that are similar! Really really fun. Think it would work brilliantly as a work team building exercise. We were in John Monroe's Office 3. We were a little slow (I could have done with another adult on the team really!) and had an awful lot of hints and were some way away from getting out of the room, or should I say rooms, as there are 2 other doors to unlock which I didn't expect. Lots of combinations to find for padlocks and safes that when unlocked reveal other clues. Brilliant concept - well done whoever thought of it. Thoroughly recommend it. The only downer - the price! Cost me \u00a363 plus 20% VAT - \u00a375.60! Quite expensive for an hour's entertainment but if 5 of you are splitting the cost then it's most definitely well worth it."

Both boys want to come back for their birthdays, and I could not recoommend it highly enough! Match that with the fact that you can park outside after 7pm, what more could you ask for in Central London? Only probelm is that currently they only have 2 different rooms to experience, so would welcome more rooms to try in the future!"

Helpful hints from Laslo came at the right moment when we seemed to steer off course. Although the room was small, there was a fan to help circulate the air. This exercise showed us how we all could work together as a family for a common cause (get out of the room). We made it out with 8 seconds to spare."

I booked tickets for Hint Hunt after reading a review in Time Out magazine and took my brother & parents along as a surprise family activity. We weren't quite sure what to expect, but it was so much more fun than I could have imagined!! You need to think outside the box and work together as a team to work out all the clues in the 60 minute deadline, but the HintHunter team help you out whenever you get stuck so you don't waste any time. The adrenaline building up in those last few frantic minutes meant we were ecstatic when we managed to escape with 1min 53 seconds left on the clock! A great sense of achievement, and thoroughly enjoyed by all the family. I have recommended to all of my friends and can't wait to go back to do the advanced room.... Caroline (25yrs)"

It is so well run, and make sure you make a reservation in advance.

My girls thought is was the best thing we did in our stay in London.Everyone in the family contributed, in fact, my 12 year old figured something out that I never would have thought of.

Even going to the toilet felt a bit Cluedo....yes I searched for clues whilst in there.

The game host is watching from outside the whole time if you need anything (our pen ran out) and to give clues when you're completely stuck, unfortunately our clue screen seemed to stop working near the end and got stuck on one hint for about 20 minutes. I would definitely recommend this for groups of friends or families with older children."

We were only in London for a few days and were traveling with three kids aged 16, 12 and 11. For the kids, Hint Hunt tied with the Tower of London as favorite things to do in London (and I had a private guide at the Tower!) All I will say about the hour is that we really didn't understand what in the world we were doing for the first few minutes but as the clues started to come together everyone became more animated as we tried to figure out the puzzles. We did not escape in time but the kids were ready to go back in and try again. In fact, they really wanted to go back another day and try the advanced room but we didn't have time. Book your time slot well in advance so that you don't miss out. Personally, I feel that the experience was really more for kids than adults but all in all it was a great way to spend an hour in a completely different way. We are still talking about the experience days later, so I suppose that's the best review I can possibly give. Enjoy."

Big Ben...Westminster Abbey...?\" Due to the ranking on Trip Advisor and our good fortune finding team mates online (also Americans, living in Germany and enjoying a London trip at the same time), we decided to play. It was one of the best things we did on our entire trip! SO, so fun! Some have called it \"brilliant\" and there is really no better word for it. Our guide/game leader was fantastic. I think she really made the game for us because she knew just how many clues to give us to let us feel like we were clever...but not too many to spoil the fun and let us out too soon! :) We escaped with 7 seconds to spare. An absolute blast. The only downside is, though they keep adding game rooms, it's always booked solid well in advance. If you are considering it, book now so you won't be disappointed to end up on the wait list."

The team to greet us was enthusiastic and maintained the sense of mystery through the introduction and did everything they could to make sure we enjoyed our experience. One point, their reception area is quite small so plan to arrive around 5 minutes before your time.We tackled the John Monroe room challenge which provided a series of clues that built on each other that we needed to solve to gain our escape from the room. It is a real team game and there is a 60 minute time limit which builds the excitement as you get closer to your escape (or not as the case may be). There was lots of searching, figuring out clues, sequencing them and sorting out red herrings from the real clues.We did not break any records but we all came out of the experience having had a great time as a family. Everyone contributed and everyone really enjoyed.A team of 4 seemed perfect - you need all of the help that you can get but more than 5 would have been a tight squeeze in the room. It is not for very young children but our 9 and 11 year were well able to participate and enjoy."

This isn't just being sat in a room solving a couple of puzzles, you're immersed in a scenario where you have to rummage around a room to find clues which help you unlock things which lead you to more clues and so and so forth until you piece the last clues together to unlock the room and escape.We had 4 people, 5 is definitely the max and may have been a bit of a squeeze and a 'too many cooks' situation, 3 would've been do-able but any less would be impossible as there's just too much to do in 1 hour - we got out with 1m3s to spare!!This isn't the best thing to see/do in London but it is a wonderful way to spend 90 mins on a rainy day."

It was extraordinarily difficult to get a booking - even by London standards, where it seems everything is booked out weeks ahead - booking 6 weeks ahead, with great difficulty we got a slot and that too only for the Zen room, which is the more \"advanced\" of the two available options. (By the way their system for finding available slots is extraordinarily cumbersome and tedious - if you plan to book, do expect to have to spend quite a while on it. It seems to me that this is something that could easily be improved).The build up to the experience was nicely done as the person who welcomed us explained the rules and did a great job of creating an atmosphere of mystery and challenge. And then we were locked into the room that we had to find our way out of within an hour. My son said that it was like playing a live version of an \"escape\" game on the computer... but I've no experience of those :)It was undoubtedly a lot of fun and the hour whizzed past. One forgot everything else - like tired feet, hunger pangs, other commonplace preoccupations like what to eat for dinner... the activity itself generated incredible focus and energy and teamwork between the three of us. In the end we were about 5 or 10 seconds away from the last step to free ourselves when we ran out of time.So, yes, fun - and very different from anything I've ever done before. But the highest rated activity to do while in London? Not even close. If you have lots of time - not to mention lots of money, because Hint Hunt is far from inexpensive - sure, go for it! I'm glad we went to see for ourselves what the fuss is all about. But in retrospect I can think of many things I'd rather have spent that amount of money on."

It seems this place has had enough praise heaped on it that it doesn't really need any more from me!But if you vaguely like solving puzzles/challenges you will LOVE this. We completed the challenge with about 3.5 minutes to spare which I think was good going, it's really well thought out.It would be (literally) impossible to solve without the clues that the organisers drip-feed to you during the hour but that's all part of the fun. Will definitely return to do their 'zen room' challenge."

Suffering a bit of jet lag (9 hour flight, arrived the night before) so that's my excuse for not getting out in time. Still it was such good fun that it really didn't matter. We were only a party of 2 so went online to find a 3rd that lived in London (in case we needed some British help). Glad we did, you really need 3 people minimum. I always like to know if a place has a washroom (yes it does). You can use it before you go in but once in you'll forget all about how tired you are or if you even did need to use the facilities and didn't. Fastest 1 hour ever. Congratulations to the owners who took such a risk and have made this a great attraction. Really nice folks and really helpful. My only hint...(not a spoiler) is take a pen and a little pad of paper. You don't have to have to but so glad we did."

Our team managed it with 2mins 42 left, the other team with 48seconds left, bragging rights to us and it was the talking point for the rest of the evening!Fun, exhilerating and requires great teamwork! I'd highly recommend it for friends, family or even a work team building exercise.I don't think you can complain to much regarding the value for money, unless you fail to escape!Staff were informal but friendly and helpful, perhaps the only comment would be to streamline the briefing before the game begins."

I can't give away too much but I will say the hour flew, with all of us running around, shouting at each other and throwing things, going mad trying to work out what we were doing and why! You all get very into it and feel a real sense of accomplishment every time you find a clue, no matter how small.

And because you waste a lot of time at the start working out why you are there in this small room, the intensity of the last 10-15 minutes really sucks at your ability add up simple numbers. The experienced Hint-hunt folks are subtle with the clues too, they want to help but they want you to work it out.

It's very good fun indeed, beautifully executed, nothing like anything else you can do in London, and compressed into 90 minutes. (Indeed, we went as a group from work - it'll take not much more than a lunch break).No wonder they're often booked up well in advance.A couple of tips:- Got a big group (like we did)? Two of the rooms are identical, allowing for competitive play; which is excellent.- I'm not convinced this would be brilliant for under-9s; at least, not without a 1-1 adults ratio.

Different from everything else we have done.At first we were worried about English being an obstacle (with English not being our mother tongue), but this was no barrier for any of us.We will definitely com back again to try the other room on our next visit to London."

We have been to London many times and visited most attractions. This is something totally different from the norm. Great for my daughters 12 & 15 and just as good for my wife & I. We parked in the underground car park in Euston station and the place is just opposite. Great friendly staff make it an even better experience."

This business is a unique way to family bound under pressure. It really tests your problem solving, coooperation, and reasoning skills. The business states they prefer kids around 10 or older but they were agreeable to letting our 7 yo play with us. The funny part is SHE was the one that found the final clue! I really hope this business continues to grow. We will deficintiely do this again when we return to London in the future. I only hope they expend and develop new rooms for people to explore and play detective!"

From an unassuming doorway in Euston you enter a fabulous adventure where you have to work together as a team to solve clues to get out of the room before it's too late. I can honestly say it's one of the best hours of fun I've had, there were thrills, puzzles, excitement and the odd helping hand from the Gamemaster. We couldn't shut up when we came out and will be raving about it to anyone who'll listen. We were a group of 4 adults but there was a family with relatively young kids who played in the second room when we went and we both came out buzzing with adrenalin after our time in the room. It's probably best not to say too much about what actually happens in the room but I think you can trust that this didn't get to number 1 in the Tripadvisor rankings for no reason. This is a great experience, we're booked to come back for the second room and can't wait for more rooms to be created."

This is a stone's throw from Euston Station in central London, so we incorporated it into a day out from Birmingham. Everyone is very friendly, the 10 minutes before our slot was spent on a comfy sofa being given the few rules and hints for the ensuing game. Then we were led into an almost empty office room. The door shut behind us, the timer on the monitor started counting down from 60 minutes, and the frenetic fun began. I can't give you any details, so as not to spoil the experience for you, but if you like problem-solving, thinking outside the box and making connections, then you will love this.

However we were met warmly by 2 Hungarian ladies who put us at our ease and gave us a briefing on what to expect. I don't want to give too much away because the surprise is a big part of the fun. However, we found ouselves being led down a fire escape into a locked room with an hour to escape. The next hour was a frantic shared problem solving exercise which had us as a team working out riddles, searching for clues, dismissing red herrings and sharing laughter and frustration in equal measure. We escaped with 7 seconds left on the clock and came out with grins across our faces and a real sense of achievement. Even our hard to please 15 year old really enjoyed it. Highly recommended!"

Was met by the friendly hungarian who gave a short briefing on what we were supposed and left us to fill in the blanks. Once in the room you get bombarded with all these clues and non-clues. Really really fun. The hour sped by so fast. A great healthy amount of stress, quick thinking, teamwork, connecting dots -- all in all a great social activity. Highly recommended!!! Thank you to the organizers for all the hints and nudges."

Not knowing what to expect, we sort of had the idea that there would be clues to solve - but you don't really consider the level of detail that goes into something like that. The basic idea is to follow the clues/puzzles/riddles to get out of the room. It's been a while since I laughed that much! The whole experience was very interactive and really couldn't have been more entertaining! A good number of people to go with is about 4/5, and I don't think the rooms accommodate more than that. But more people would hinder, rather than help. From walking in to getting out we were faced with puzzles, little obstacles, some lateral thinking and looking in every nook and cranny we could find to find the things that lead to clues and solving of clues. Definitely recommended for team building - and especially if just for a bit of fun with friends. Ingenious Fun!"

It's so much fun and made me laugh because you keep finding things which you know must be useful but you have no idea why :)Andrea gave us some really helpful hints along the way and even helped us with our maths which was rubbish hahahah it was great that she was able to steer us along without giving too much away.We did manage to make it out in time (58 minutes and 36 seconds) but only just and the last few minutes were really stressful trying to lock together the last few cluesI would 100% recommend this to anyone, and we will be back to take on the Zen room challenge next!"

At those words we laughed, the door, looking very much ordinary, was opened, we got in and there it began! Following the main idea of the creators - not to explain aything-I omit all the details how we did it- say only it was absolutely captivating and brought us a great joy every time when we found something or solve a code or combination to open the lock!'So London is a wonderful city- BUT- if you are already somehow tired of the daily routine of sightseeing and viewing all the \"London icons\" -HintHunt is the right place to go and to have an experience of an absolutely different kind! We were not the winners- turned out to be in one step from it-but we really enjoyed every minute of those 60 given! We wish you success- you'll like the game-we are sure!PS SIC! Some HINTS for HintHunt:1.They start to sell it to the team of three- there were two of us and after corresponding HintHunt by e-mail we found an agreement-so address them,they are flexible.2.For my compatriots coming from Russia and actually to anyone who is not a native speaker-though Atti said- you don't need much abilities to speak English to play it- yes! that's true-but yoy'll definitely need to be able to understand the written one.Why?Just go and find out why!:-) We wish you all success and a lot of fun!"

Finished the John Monroe room with 8 seconds to spare with 4 of us which was a great buzz. Couldn't recommend more, a hidden gem and I don't see how you could be disappointed! Will definitely return next time we're in London."

We were a bit sceptical about it beforehand but it turned out to be so much fun, a real life CSI/Midsomer Murders investigation! The tips and hints given throughout the challenge were very useful and made it actually possible to solve within the 60 minutes. Can't wait to do one of the other, harder rooms. Have recommended it to everyone."

A fresh break from the usual tourist stuff. A few minutes walk from Euston station. Really hoping to be able to go again sometime. Better to wait til the kids are at least mid-teens. There were 5 of us and it kept us mad busy the whole fun 60 mins trying to beat the clock. Helga was fantastic."

It sounded I teresting and the reviews were all positive so it seemed an interesting way to spend an hour. It far exceeded our expectations. The registration notes that it is a minimum of 3 and we were just a party of 2 so I emailed the HintHunt guys to find out if we could still participate. Their response was very prompt letting us know that it is harder with two and we would have to pay the rate for three but if we were game they would do their best to ensure it was a fun experience, we decided to go for it. They were easy to find from the tube. Chobski was friendly, positive and clearly explained how to play and best strategies for success and then we were locked in. I wont spoil the fun but it was a very quick hour. We were one clue short of making it out but that didn't deter from the fun. It just made us want to go back and try a different room. Unfortunately it was all booked.If you want something different and like a challenge you will love HintHunt."

I was with my son. i had arranged this event and was intrigued as to what it would be like after reading previous reviews. My friend, being the suspicious type, had decided to check the venue out prior to meeting up with me. He said that he felt that I had been scammed as the venue was locked and he had a bad vibe!When we arrived the door was locked but at that moment the Hint Hunt crew appeared, as if by magic, behind us and let us in.From then on the adventure began and I will only say that we were not scammed and I will only describe it in one word- BRILLIANT!"

I went Hint Hunting with my husband and 2 friends this weekend and I can HIGHLY recommend it.A well thought-through entertaining game for all, we really didn't know what to expect before we went into the locked room, but now we're all desperate to do it again (and better!). We had a great time working together to solve the puzzles in the room, and when we came out we discussed it for hours - who had done what, where we had found X and what we would have done differently. This game is exactly as advertised and the creators have put in a huge amount of effort to make it enjoyable yet challenging; mind-stimulating but not frustrating. I was very very impressed and highly recommend it to groups of puzzlers - best way to spend a cold winters' afternoon ever!"

Before you know it your heart is racing as fast as the time is ticking down. There are plenty of Eureka! moments when you solve one thing only to realise that it just opens up a whole new world of things to work out and frown over. Now stop reading all these reviews, book your visit and be Sherlock Holmes for an afternoon as there aren't many places in London that offer so much fun for such a decent price!"

The how and the why are for you to figure out but beware as the door closes behind you you have merely an hour to do so. Unravel the mystery, follow the clues, solve the puzzle. we escaped with 9 seconds to spare! and were elated.In the pub afterwards we spent many hours discussing with our friends in the other group 'who found this' and 'how someone solved that', it was clear their enjoyment of the experiance was every bit on a par with ours. the excitement that builds with the momentum that seems to gather as the hour progresses was almost tangible! so much so that we needed to spend this time afterwards talking about it and reliving our expiriences. The one overiding thing which we all agreed upon is that we will be returning to Hint hunt as soon as possible to attempt their latest challenge."

The game itself involves being locked in a room (with a group of your nearest and dearest) having just one hour to escape- a hair-raising thought! In order to escape you have to work quickly to solve riddles, find clues and there is even some light arithmetic involved. If you're fast enough you are rewarded with freedom and a great sense of accomplishment. A lot of thought has been put into developing the game and there is a wide variety of different activities to keep you entertained for the full hour. Oh and trust me you WILL need the full hour- my group only just making it out in time."
