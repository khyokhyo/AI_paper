It was a beautiful experience to be able to worship among believers in a place that people have worshiped at for hundreds of years. We came back on a weeknight and got to listen to the organist play during evening mass. My brother in law played the organ afterwards due to his connection with the organist. We were in awe of the way the music flowed through the church! I would highly recommend visiting this church if you are in Buenos Aires."

The coolest thing is that they were playing music of monks chanting, which created a spectacular ambiance. We walked around and took picture ms with no issues, there were only two people on the pews."

It has one of the most beautiful interiors I have seen. It has lovely stained glass windows, intricately carved stone, wood and marble, intricate mosaics and tiled floors. The chapel in the crypt is also beautiful."

The outside is beautiful though surrounded on 3 sides by other buildings, so you can only really appreciate the front edifice. The inside is gorgeous and well lit. You immediately feel a peace when you walk in. It's an active church, so there were a few locals coming out of confession and praying while I was there. It was the perfect place to sit, gather my thoughts, and appreciate the blessing of being there."

The basilica is gorgeous and absolutely ornate, but it's not overwhelming in size; it feels more intimate than St. Peter's in Vatican City or St. Paul's in London. Not a single detail in the design was overlooked. Personally, I don't think you need more than 30 minutes here, unless you'd like to attend a service."

Not overly impressive from the outside (especially with roadworks going on out the front when we visited). Step inside and the splendour is amazing. Interesting bit of history inside as well. We were there for the changing of the guards. I felt that this was a bit over rated and there were too many tourists around at the time. Other travellers have noted how peaceful it was. Choose your timing. If a bunch of tourists are not your thing, don't try to incorporate the changing of the guards."

Firstly it does not look like a Basillica - and you could easily miss it because it is located behind big edifice. Locals told me a story about how the powerful family who did not like the \"basillica\" and had therefore built the big building to block their view. Well, the cathedral at the main square (where the Rosada is located) certainly is more grand and the inside more lavish. Unless you are in the neighbourhood, and have lots of time on hand, probably do not need to include this stop as part of your itinerary."

Just going inside and looking around for 10 min will be enough, I think. The most interesting part about this church is about knowing its history. I do recommend to take Free Walks in Buenos Aires, where they will tell you the tragic love story connected with the church. After knowing they story, it will be more exciting to visit it, I think."

The Catedral Metropolitana is in the Plaza de Mayo which you will likely visit anyway, and the Greek Revival exterior is different from the other churches close by including this one. Even some of the photos shown are not of this basilica. The foundation stone was placed in March 1908. In November of 1916 Pope Benedict XV established this it as a Minor Basilica. It has some interesting history but is much smaller than the Catedral Metropolitana.If this review is helpful then please indicate so below."

It does not look like a cathedral from the outside; it is in neoclassic style. Inside there is a silver lectern from which the current Pope Francis officiated when cardinal. There is what appears to a side altar with the remains of San Martin, the liberator of Argentina. he was alsoleader of the Army of the Andes seeking liberation from Spain in the 19th Century for Peru and Chile as well. However, this \"room\" is not really a part of the Cathedral, as San Martin was a free mason. The vault is guarded by army sentinels in uniform. Beautiful building with lots of history. "
