At the end of tasting time, we got a surprise: a late harvest wine that was not planned. ;P\nI think this was one of the best things we did in BA. Strong recommended!!!!"

He took his time explaining every wine and tapas we were giving. Our group was only 4 so it seemed really personal almost family style, just sitting and talking as we learned about the different wines. I think we spent almost 2 hours if not more but it was well worth it. I would do this again."

Diego was skilled at leading us through the experience with humor and intelligence, sharing his great depth of knowledge. The tapas pairings were delectable. It was nice to be in a small group where conversation can easily happen - we very much enjoyed meeting other travelers from Brazil and hearing about their experiences. A pleasant and enriching experience all the way around!"

We booked on the website and had a prompt reply with details of where/when to go. The location does not have signage outside and you have to ring an intercom buzzer to be allowed in. Diego provided background information and ample tastings of five wines, ranging from sparkling white to red wines, all from boutique wineries in the west of Argentina. The wines were accompanied with five small tapas, which complemented the wines perfectly.It was a great experience, lasting just over 2 hours. Highly recommended as a pre-dinner scene setter!"

It's nice to try wines from boutique Argentinian wineries and support \"the little guy\". The tapas tastings went well with the wines.These are not super high end wines, but very affordable, drinkable wines that are good for every day. They shipped our 3 cases back to California and the wines arrived at our house before we did! In a week! Our next trip will be to Mendoza to visit some of these wineries."

Located in a trendy neighborhood of Palermo Soho area of Buenos Aires. They have options to ship the wine back to your home- free if you order a case. They serve wines from vineyards that you can't find in the states. Definitely has be wanting to take a trip back to Buenos Aires just to go to Mendoza or Salta. They give you a tapas sized plate of food for every wine you taste. 2nd pours are encouraged and our host gave us a taste of an extra wine. Diego was very knowledgeable not just of wines, but also of things to do in the city- especially where to eat!."

This time we had Bertie as our tasting guide and he was excellent. Anuva has a very well designed area for the tasting as well as a nice balcony that you can drink on if the day permits. The food pairings with the wines were great. It wasn't to much food but enhanced the tasting. Being a beginner in wine tasting Bertie gave us lots of information that was easy to understand and remember. He really made the experience great and I couldn't ask for a better teacher. I left feeling like a pro. You also have the option to order wine and have it shipped back to the USA(which we did). All in all it was a great day, and it makes you feel like you have been to Mendoza without all the trouble of getting there. Highly recommended!!"

I would have loved to take the 3 hour flight to Mendoza but unfortunately time didn't permit so I tried to find an alternative. And I found the perfect one! Anuva Wines allows you to taste extremely high quality wines that are the \"best kept secrets\" in the Mendoza region. The wine cellar is clean and gorgeous. The sommelier is extremely well educated and teaches you all about the wine region, types of wine and grapes and answers any questions you may have. Would highly recommend of any wine drinkers/lovers!!"

We booked it because we weren't able to visit the Mendoza or Salta wine regions - but wanted to learn about and taste some quality Argentinian wines. This was perfect for that!Alice was our lovely and knowledgable host. We tried 5 wines - one sparkling white, another white (which had a sneaky twist!) and three reds. All were delicious. We particulary appreciated that Anuva showcases wines from smaller producers. The tastings were generous, with top ups always offered. The food was very good without being spectacular - but paired very well with the wines. We really enjoyed chatting with the other guests, its a very social atmostphere. The only small negative was that they had some diners coming (I think they offer dinners now) so it felt a bit rushed towards the end and we had to be coaxed out, we were having such a good time we would have loved to stay longer! Also hoping that Anuva might be able to offer free shipping to Australia (as with the US) sometime in the future! Let me know if you do!"

I am happy to report that Anuva exceeded my expectations. Bertie was our host and sommelier, providing a passionate and informative description of each of the varietals chosen for us, and the characteristics of the regions in which they were crafted. He is clearly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what he does. 2 whites and 3 reds made up our exploration. I will not go into detail about the names and traits, for I assume Anuva changes what they serve regularly. Suffice it to say they were each delightful in their own way, and I would happily drink each of them again. There are small plates that accompany each glass, selected for their ability to complement whichever wine you are sampling. There is a brief explanation of how the plate enhances the drink.Our tasting group that evening was made up of people from several different countries. The conversation was lively and fun, and Bertie was always there to facilitate discussion or answer questions (of which we had several). Should I find myself in BA again, I would be happy to return."

You are seated at a big table with many other friendly people (mostly tourists), so you get a chance to discuss the wine and get to know other people who are traveling. Everyone at my table was really friendly and got along very well. At the tasting, you can try 5 different wines - for us, there was one sparkling, one torrontes (white wine from Argentina that is delicious and not very common in the states), and three red blends (with malbec featured heavily in two). Our sommelier was very knowledgable about the region and the wines, plus he was quite generous with the pour. He was also quick to offer refills when he saw that your glass was nearing empty. Not only did I have good wine, but it was all paired with delicious food. I planned on having dinner after, but with two crostinis, a corn stew, a meat and cheese plate, an empanada, and a chocolate truffle, I was full by the end of the tasting. If you're traveling alone, like me, this is a super easy and fun way to meet people, make friends, and start the night off well. I definitely recommend it!"

The prize of it is too overprized for what you get. We were 8 people and after he poured the 7.5dl bottle, almost half of the bottle was full! so we did not even get half of the normal tasting size (1dl) to try the wine. We had to ask him several times if we could get a little more wine so at least we can actually taste the wine. I did also a wine tasting in Chile on a vineyard and there we only paid half prize and got the double of what Anuva Wines was offering. So all in all I do not recommend this wine tasting. I am surprised that all the other comments are so positive."

This was such a wonderful experience - from the ambiance, to the friendly/knowledgeable staff and diverse guests, I would say that this was one of the top experiences during my stay in Buenos Aires. The wine and food pairings were exceptional and I found that the carefully chosen food pairings definitely elevated the wine to an even higher level (who would have known that could be done!?!). The wine portions are generous and the host walked each guest through the experience of exploring the wines with each of their palates. Whether a novice or a skilled wine taster, I think each of us learned something we didn't know prior to this wine tasting. It is located in a trendy section of Palermo Soho, so if you have time to walk around before the tasting, check out some of the small shops that are around the area. I very much appreciated that Anuva wines are from small, family-owned wineries and the love that they have for wine-making is evident in the final product. Lastly, if you are interested in purchasing wine to come back to the States, this is the BEST way to have it shipped. This is one of the few places that can ship it for a reasonable price to your home (unless you reside in one of the 9 states that don't allow importation of of any alcoholic beverages)."

It isn't billed as dinner, but our session ran from about 6 to 8, and we really didn't need dinner afterward.Diego is a great host. Very personable, and extremely well informed. He knows a ton about the industry. If you are interested, you can learn a lot in a fun relaxed setting."

Diego was incredibly knowledgeable about all of the wines and Mendoza region. Each of the wines came with a paired tapa. All of the food was delicious and paired so perfectly with the wine. I learned so much about food pairing from this. Diego made sure everyone felt included at the table and it was fun interacting with all the other guests.

I thought that after a nap, this might be a perfect introduction to Argentina. We took a cab across town, arrived a bit early and walked around the neighborhood. The door is unmarked, you ring a bell, give your name through the intercom, and someone comes to fetch you. It is a bit like going into a speakeasy but instead of going into a windowless basement, you ascend to a light filled loft. We tasted about 6 wines with food pairing. Diego was a great teacher and his love for his country's wine and food shined through. You are able to purchase wine with free shipping to the US. We bought a case and it arrived at our house when we did two weeks later!The loft is also used for a pop-up dinner on weekends. If we could have fit it into our schedule, we definitely would have.

Ours appeared to know exactly pulling up directly outside the door. They rang for a taxi for afterwards to return to our hotel in the Puerto Madero area. Our host was Bertie who had a very pleasant way of getting us to learn and taste the flavours of Argentinian wines along with some interesting food.  The two of us along with three Canadians and two Americans had good time. About 90 mins if I recall. All in all a great afternoon and as it was raining outside so it worked well for us. I may well have purchased but they don't ship to the U.K. only the U.S. coupled with the fact we had to get on a ship and knowing their rules about carry on booze that ended that idea.  AuroraUK"

The price was fine for the amount of wine, food and explanation they provide, but she was quite pushy with wine sales. We bought a few bottles to ship home to Chicago, and really felt betrayed and scammed when we entered wine shops later in the week and found the exact same wines for a fraction of the price Anuva charges. See attached pictures for evidence.For example the Mairena Bonarda Anuva we bought for USD 25/per bottle (shipping not included) was 110 pesos (around USD 8) at a wine shop in Buenos Aires. The Laborum Torrontes Anuva sells for USD 20 was going for 185 pesos (14 dollars and a buy 2 get 1 free promo). Be aware of Anuva trying to rip off unsuspecting tourists."

We had a large group that is known to have fun and she not only welcomed us warmly but also shared her knowledge of exciting Argentinian wines. The Chin Chin sparkling wine was the perfect start. The Malbecs that followed were further enhanced by traditional tapas that were beautifully paired. It was my son's birthday and this was his most memorable evening of the entire trip. Thank-you everyone that made this night so amazing.Linda"

I loved that we tried wines from different regions all around Argentina, not just wine from Mendoza - Salta in the North and I think a Malbec from the South in Patagonia? All the tapas that were paired with the wines were delicious and the perfect amount of food. I learned a lot from Cara, the sommelier, especially in how to articulate descriptions of wine.  I went with my father who was visiting Argentina. He also loved the afternoon at Anuva Wines and it helped him appreciate Argentine Malbecs as we went out to dinner the next few nights trying them."

Cara was very knowledgeable and helpful for both the experienced wine drinkers and the beginners to tasting (such as myself). While they do not ship to Canada yet, the shipment option for the wines is another reason to choose Anuva Wines. If you are an American or a Canadian who can ship to a US address this is a great way to efficiently bring great wine home.Her and the rest of the staff were also a good help in recommending some other good restaurants and bars in BA. Highly recommend this experience!"

We visited Anuva on our second day in Buenos Aires, and had a phenomenal experience - the tasting room is in a great location, in a second floor loft in the trendy Palermo area of the city. The wines were both delicious and unexpected, as the company highlights wines which are only from smaller vineyards and types of wine that you'd normally never find back home in the States. The presentation and food pairings were great, and Florencia (the sommelier) was knowledgeable, friendly and spoke impeccable English. Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy wine and are in Buenos Aires."

The sommelier and his assistant were very personable and we had a lot of fun with him. The tasting, drinking, and eating were very well paced. The food was almost more of a highlight (for me anyway) than the wine. I liked the wines quite a bit even though I'm not a huge traditional wine drinker. I loved the white, the champagne, and one of the reds. I took advantage of what was on offer and ordered 6 bottles for delivery at home in the U.S. (rather than bother with lugging them around for the rest of my trip in South America.) They arrived as indicated in less than four weeks. A great experience; nice way to spend an afternoon in B.A. and I highly recommend."

Here is what the Anuva Wines experience was like for us:After booking on their website we showed up at the address provided in the confirmation email. No sign, a black metal door with gang graffitti covering it and a broken sidewalk directly in front. We rung the doorbell half expecting it was a scam at this point. A young woman answered the door and introduced herself as a study abroad student that would be conducting our wine tasting...Hmm, wine expert...So the tasting began and it quickly became very clear that the full intent was to sell sell sell wine. Obviously it is nice to be able to buy some wine to take home, but are all those signs saying they ship wine and including it in the script every 30 seconds really needed? The wines were quite mediocre in our opinions. In London we get much better wine from Argentina. Do yourself a favour and just go to a wine bar and order a few different glasses of local wine."

Diego introduced himself, passed out cards for our wine notes, then got started with the first wine, Las Perdices Extra Brut, right away. As he discussed the wine, we sipped, then tried it with the first of five appetizers. On to 2 whites and followed by 2 reds. I live near Napa so I've done this kind of thing before, so I was surprised that I learned some new information. The pours were generous, glasses were refilled and at the end we could ask for more of any of the wines. The wine was delicious. The cost, $52 USD each, was very fair for such generous pours and the 5 food pairings, with the excellent wine presentations as a great added bonus.We were invited to order any of the wines at the close of the program, without any pressure.The room is attractive with lots of natural light coming in through large windows. We were upstairs, and there was a balcony we could step onto. Everything was very clean. Everyone's English was excellent.Before we went I was confused about the food: While certainly adequate, the food pairings did not constitute dinner. Anuva is upstairs behind a black, unmarked industrial-looking door, and it is easy to miss. The directions we were given were good though, so no problem.The four of us had a great evening and we are very glad we went. Salud!"

Asking for seconds (or thirds) were not only expected but encouraged...from past experience, this is a rare (and very much appreciated) service indeed!It's not cheap at $52, especially by local standards - but if you can afford it, it's worth every penny.

It was a great opportunity to try wines from smaller Argentine producers that we weren't necessarily familiar with beforehand. The pours were all generous, with seconds on request. The accompanying food was incredibly delicious and certainly paired well with all the wines. We purchased a couple bottles to take home and wish they shipped to where we live!

Most were knowledgeable about wines, so there wasn't a lot of time spent on the basics. I've been on wine tours and tastings, but this was the first one I've done with food pairings. The combination with food made such a huge difference and really highlighted how this can affect the wine's taste. The food was good and the pours plentiful. We also received excellent recommendation for dinner."

It was a fun, relaxing way to start our trip. 5 great wines paired with fantastic food. Diego was our host, he was fun, informative and relaxed. Just enough information about the wine and region without being stuffy or snobby. He provided helpful tips and suggestions about restaurants and activities for the rest of our time in Argentina. The venue is a hidden gem behind an unmarked door. Great value for a truly enjoyable evening!"

My fiance and I spent our first afternoon in Buenos Aires at the stunning Anuva Wines loft for a wine tasting, which completely exceeded our expectations. Along with an incredibly knowledgeable sommelier to guide us, the range of wines was absolutely stunning, as were the delicious accompanying tapas. Not only did we enjoy drinking the wines, we also learned a great deal about Argentine wines and the South American wine regions. If you don't have a chance to make it to Mendoza while in Argentina, this is definitely the next best option!"

We heard about Malbec and its history in Argentina and were incredibly excited to learn more about wines from an expert. Another couple was scheduled to do the tasting with us, but canceled, so we had the afternoon to ourselves with Samantha. Samantha ran our tasting and you could tell that she was passionate about her work and wines. With each wine tasting there was a food pairing - chocolate truffles from Ecuador, empanadas, and sorbet. We had a later flight that evening and started our day off with this experience. Down the street are many beautiful shops, so you really can make a day out of this. With every wine we tasted came a beautiful story from Samantha about its origin. We had bottles shipped to us back in Chicago with no worries. Every time we opened a bottle we thought about this special trip. Highly recommend this, as it was a great afternoon and way to experience the wines of the region if you don't make it to Mendoza."

The place is nice. It looks like a big kitchen in a loft. Diego who presented the wines spoke Portuguese which was a plus because my partner does not speak English. The wines were amazing and really helped me to get to know the wine culture in Argentina. The tapas were really tasting and I loved the fact that you could drink more wine if you wanted to.

A couple friends and I went to Argentina hearing lots of things about their amazing wines, but we didn't really know what to look for when we were there, other than \"Malbec.\" Based on TripAdvisor recommendations, we decided to do a tasting at Anuva, and we weren't disappointed. We tasted (and sort of drank a lot of) 5 different wines, and were led on our wine \"journey\" by the wonderful Florencia. We tasted 1 torrontes, 1 bernardo, and 3 malbecs, and each wine was delicious and very well paired with the food items they were served with. Between the three of us, we ended up buying 2 cases of wine to be shipped back to us in California (and they had a great free shipping deal too)! Florencia also gave us some great food and drink recommendations around town! Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn about Argentinian wines from wine experts!"

One sparkling, one white and 3 reds, showcasing the best of Argentinian wines- not limited to Malbec! (Although the Malbec was fantastic). The food pairings were lovely and enough for me and my partner for dinner.

It was an intimate setting (only four other people participating - we greatly enjoyed chatting and discussing the wines with them) and Cara was warm, charismatic, and very knowledgeable. The wines were all delicious and demonstrated the rich variety of wines from Argentina which go beyond the standard Malbec. I was also pleasantly surprised to try a couple of Malbecs that had lovely flavor profiles that were really different from the Malbecs that I have access to at home. We ordered a case of wine, taking advantage of the free shipping to the US.The tapas offered during the tasting were delicious - the perfect appetizer before strolling through Palermo and enjoying a delicious dinner there later in the evening at Social Paraiso (recommended to us by Cara). All in all, a great experience and an excellent way to experience Argentina's wine culture without traveling all the way to the wine-producing regions. Of course - now we are eager to plan a trip back and visit the Mendoza botique wineries that Cara introduced us to.!"

My husband and I visited Buenos Aires this January, and had the opportunity to partake in the food and wine pairing lunch at Anuva. The experience was an absolute delight!There was not a wine in the bunch (and we tasted a total of six) that we did not enjoy - everything was very good quality. It also seemed that Anuva takes great care in curating their wines, with many varietals from all over Argentina. (While malbecs from Mendoza are wonderful and you should definitely drink many of them, we appreciated getting to see other sides of the Argentine wine world.) We ordered a case of wine after our tasting, choosing from wines we had tasted and wines recommended to us by the sommelier, which was shipped to us for free. Based on the costs of shipping we saw at wineries in Mendoza, this alone is reason to spend an afternoon with Anuva.On to the food... Delicious! Again, it felt like everything was very carefully curated, with much thought and care put into each dish. And these are just small bites either, you'll definitely fill up while you're here. I also appreciated how accommodating they were with my vegetarian diet - even though I was unable to give them advanced notice, they were able to whip something up for me even when the planned pairing was a meat dish. We especially loved the humita paired with a delicious torrontes.Good wine, good food, what's left? Good people! Anuva has that too. Our sommelier, Diego, was an absolute wealth of knowledge not only about the wines we were drinking that day, but about the entire Argentine (and Chilean) wine industry. He expertly weaved information about the wine itself (tasting notes) with stories of the wineries and wine makers, making the tasting interesting and informative. As we were departing for Mendoza a few days after our visit to Anuva, we asked Diego if he could give us some dining and wine tasting recommendations. He gave us a detailed list of wineries that they work with at Anuva, wineries that serve lunch, wineries we could bike to, and much more. We went to three wineries he recommended, and all of them were excellent, and very different from each other. He also gave us a wine tour company recommendation that we booked and had a phenomenal time with.The $52 USD / person is well worth it for a wonderful company and delicious food and wine in the heart of Palermo. Make a reservation & enjoy!"

Our host Diego was terrific and extremely friendly - made us feel at home. The tapas that go with the wines are just fabulous and really do go well with the different types of vino.

Walking into the loft I was pleasantly surprised at the decor...was very clean and inviting. The temperatures outdoors were also very hot and I was happy to find inside was nicely air-conditioned. We were greeted us with enthusiasm and kindness by Cara. She was great, able and willing to answer all of our questions about the wines we had. The wines were all paired with tasty tapas style dishes. I thought there was plenty of food and wine for the experience and I didn't leave hungry! I am not a very knowledgable wine drinker, but there were a variety of people at our table and I think we all enjoyed the experience. I would definitely recommend the experience to all who are curious about this wine tasting, from newbies to experts. The only concern I had was there was a case of stairs to climb to get to the loft. One of the guests had two canes to walk with but he made it up with some assistance."

Our host Florencia was really enthusiastic and had a lot of knowledge. She explained the history of Argentine wines, their development and the wine regions and did that in a very entertaining way. We tasted wines from different vineyards, they were great and tasteful and Florencia wasn't generous when pouring the wine. Finally, the ambiance was really good and I thought it was nice to have the chance to taste with other people in the group from all over the world and share our experiences. This wine tasting is suitable for people with any level of wine knowledge: most important is that you enjoy good wine and good food."

The food that was paired with each of the wines was perfect. Our wine education was limited previous to this visit, but we felt comfortable in the atmosphere of learning that now encourages us to taste wine with new eyes. An extra bonus was the connection they have with a distributor in the US, so we were able to order wine back home!"

The loft in which the event was held was tasteful and light and our guide (Diego) was a charming and lovely presenter who led us expertly through five different (but equally enjoyable) styles of wine: A sparkling, a white and three reds, including malbecs. I thoroughly recommend the experience, including the beautiful tapas that accompanied each wine. Thank you, Anuva', for a lovely and informative experience."

My dad and I were looking for a place to taste good Argentinian wines on short notice and we were able to book a wine tasting with Anuva wines. The experience was outstanding and one I would eagerly repeat! Diego was our phenomenal host and not only did he speak flawless English (among several other languages), but he knew an exceptionally large amount about the wine produced in his country. And not only did we enjoy tasting the wine, but the tapas provided were surprisingly excellent as well. The food paired well with the wine and was very well-prepared. My personal favorite was the chocolate at the end! We enjoyed the wine so much we had two cases shipped back to the U.S. for us.

My boyfriend and I were visiting B.A. for a few days and didn't have enough time to make it to Mendoza, so we opted for this wine tasting instead. It exceeded all expectations. I can honestly say this was one of the greatest highlights of our trip. I'm not even sure where to start, but I'll give it a try:1) Diego, a very knowledgeable and personable sommelier who educated us on the various exquisite boutique wines at the tasting (which included extra brut, torrontes, bonarda (bet you never heard of that one before), syrah roble, and a malbec reserve);2) THE PORTIONS!!!! Generous portions, like I've never seen before, with optional refills (we got way more than our money's worth);3) The FOOD!! Each wine was paired with a different small bite. This included empanadas saltanas, humaita, assorted cheeses and more. Absolutely delicious and the different bites really did bring out the distinct flavors of each wine. The food was also generously portioned, and my boyfriend and I agree that the empanadas were the best we've ever had. You will leave the tasting more than satisfied -- this can either suffice as dinner or you should plan to eat a very late dinner many hours later (you will not leave hungry, I promise);4) The WINES!!!! I'm not an expert, but I know what I like, and these wines were damn tasty. So much so that we ordered a case and had it shipped to us in the U.S. -- it just arrived!!.All in all, it was a delightful time and a lovely tasting in a beautiful loft (don't be put off by the graffiti'd building exterior, the inside is spacious and beautiful!!) It was an educational, fun, and delicious experience!!! If you are in Buenos Aires, you MUST make a reservation!! I trust that someday we will be back in B.A., and when we are, we will most definitely return to Anuva."

There is nothing else like it, so you don't really have a choice if it's something that you want to do. We tried to attend a wine tasting offered by a hotel in Palermo the night before, and it was canceled sometime during the 15 minutes that we were walking from our hotel to the wine tasting (our hotel had called ahead and made reservations). And some of the other places we called seemed to have a wishy washy answer as to what time the tasting was and whether or not they had space (if we \"came now\" they could fit us in but not sure about what time it would be the next day...). So, the only reliable place to taste wines is Anuva. Which is why they can charge $52 for a tasting.Everything here is conducted in US Dollars and they have a strict reservation requirement (which includes a $52 deposit per reservation). They also have a strict start time (since the other people in the group will be waiting on you if you are late). About the highest level of organization I came across while in Buenos Aires. Reservations are made online and a detailed confirmation email is sent out - make sure to read those directions carefully because it is hard to find (there is an unmarked black door; you need to push a button to have someone come down and open the door for you).Our 6 pm tasting included light bites as pairing that left us hungry for dinner immediately after, but not hungry enough for a large dinner.The loft and the pairing were lovely, and the sommelier was very knowledgeable. The tasting included a sparkling white, white, and 3 reds (with as many refills as you like, but be careful, as I got quite tipsy). LAS PERDICES Extra Brut (sparkling white) paired with a CrostiniMAREINA Torrontes (white) paired with strawberry and mango sorbetThe 3 reds are served together:MAREINE Bonarda - paired with a meat and cheese plateSAN GIAMIGNANO Syrah Roble - paired with a beef emapandaCARINAE FNCA DENEZA Malbec - paired with dark chocolateThe experience was great - the loft beautiful and everything presented well, BUT I did not love any of the wines. The sommelier seems to have \"moved on \" from Malbecs but for most of us, we have not yet moved on and probably would have liked to try more than one Malbec. We bought a couple bottles on his recommendation, but discovered we had been ripped off when we got to duty free (we paid $39 for a $22 bottle) so be careful of that. He recommended a dinner spot to us (Freud & Fahler) and said his friend would take care of us when we got there, but his friend didn't actually work there anymore. Oops. It was okay, but not great.So all in all, it was a fun experience that I enjoyed, but it didn't help me discover any new wines (or restaurants)."

In fact, he phoned back to the office to verify the address, as the door gave no indication whatsoever of the business that lay behind it. The staff were welcoming and knowledgeable, the wines were glorious and the food pairings inspired. A little more chilled white wine would seem a sensible precaution as not everyone can cope with red wine - I have no problem, but my companion does and she should realistically have forewarned Anuva. They tried really hard to solve this issue, full marks to them.Alas, they have no trade with the UK so we couldn't ship wine home; instead we bought some bottles for consumption whilst still in Argentina (they slipped down effortlessly).This is not a place you can wander into and they don't advertise anywhere but they do have a Facebook page. Our travel agent knew about it, because she used to live in Buenos Aires, hence the booking."

The wine was great as was the tapas pairings. It was great fun to get to know other travelers and discuss the wine with them as well. We originally booked a time that no one else had and the staff at Anuva asked if we would like to switch to a time when others were available as well, we did and did not regret it. At the end they allow you to order their wines and others that they work with and have it shipped home or to take it with you. Unfortunately they do not have the other wines available to taste and you just have to order them based on your best guess. I can't wait to get our case and hope I guessed deliciously!"

The location is good, the hostess very friendly, the wines are adequate representations of good Argentinian wine making if not great compared to what I tasted in mendoza a few days later (but that's all taste, right). The paired food wasn't anything worth remembering with the exception of the torrontes (lovely wine in its own right) paired with two overly sweet sorbets, which I found horrible. It literally left a bitter taste in the mouth and the ice cream closed my taste buds for the wine that followed. Reading back on tripadvisor later it seems I am not the first to write in negative terms about the sorbet and wine pairing. Apparently they do not change the combinations much but in a tasting at a too steep price for Argentina (so aimed at north-American tourists, I presume) gourmets would probably find this below par. For me, the tasting just didn't recover after that"

The food pairings are substantive enough that you won't need a very large dinner, if any, after. The wines were all interesting and mostly from relatively small production runs, and our tasting included a sparkling white, a white, and 3 reds. At the end, you can then order bottles of what you've tasted or any of the other bottles they currently have in their rotation (they will even ship them to you if you are in the United States). Was definitely a bit expensive ($50 per person) for those travelling on a budget, but is a fun and interesting splurge if you are interested in wine (and you can ask for as many refills of the glasses as you'd like, so on a per glass basis, you may even come out ahead). The people at our tasting were all very interesting travelers, and you have plenty of time to interact, so it is also a great way to meet some new people as well."

I went by myself and it was really great - nice people, cool looking venue, the wines were excellent and also perfectly paired with food. The last Malbec was perfectly matched with dark chocolate :-) Our host Diego did a great job in explaining the different wines and answering all types of questions from his 9 guest this evening. We tried 1 sparkling, 1 white and 3 red wines and there were plenty of re-fills for those who wanted that. We even got to try an additional red Malbec that he had open at the very end.The event started at 5 PM and lasted for about 2 hours. All wines could be purchased and shipped, but there was no pressure to buy anything. (...but of course I needed to bring back some of that perfect Malbec :-D)As I have coeliac it was really appreciated that they had prepared gluten free food for me - even empanadas! Great wines, great service, great evening! :-)"

I know that for people that are from Buenos Aires, like me, will sound weird to go and have these kinds of experiences, but price is not high, and the wine quality you get is pretty good, and the 5 different \"tapas\" are very good as well.. It only takes about 2hs, and you get to have a fun moment. If you do it in English, you will probably get Cara as you sommelier, and she is just great, funny and knowledgeable..

There were only 8 of us there, which meant that we got a very personalized discussion of each wine and the food pairings from our host, Cara. I was attending on my own, but never felt awkward or left out. Those running the show clearly are invested in the overall experience for each guest.I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to find the location, but the directions sent with my confirmation were very clear, and I was able to get there without a problem. They suggest taking a taxi, but you could as easily take the Subte and walk about 20 minutes from the closest station, or the 140 bus which runs along Cordoba and will get you within a block. The space itself is gorgeous--a light-filled loft in a beautiful neighborhood. Though the space is large, the set up still makes it feel cozy, almost like a dinner party with friends. The wines were fantastic. They are all from small wineries, so you're unlikely to have encountered any before. We tasted one sparkling, one white, and three reds (with refills on whatever you wanted to keep tasting). The food pairings were delicious, and the relationships between each food and wine were explained really well. I'm a vegetarian, and they easily accommodated this, even though I booked at the last minute. One final note: you can ship home any of the wines you tasted to the US (and I think Australia?). I had really wanted to bring wine home, but wasn't comfortable brining it in my luggage, so this solved the problem perfectly. And with wines that are unique, and that I now know the backstory of, which will be great for gifts, and putting in my own stock."

In Australia normally you get a small sample of the wine and can spit it out in a spittoon if necessary. This is not the case at the wine tasting by Anuva. We sampled a couple of white wines and a couple of red wines. A small tapas meal is provided with each wine. Personally speaking, I did not really like the wines and wanted to spit mine out. However there was nowhere to do this and I didn't want to be rude by not drinking the wine. Your wine glass gets repeatedly topped up so it is more of a booze-fest than a \"tasting\". My partner really enjoyed his wines and had no problems with the supply of wine... :)The food provided with the wines match the wines really nicely. The service was fantastic and the staff were very knowledgeable. By the end of the tasting I was pretty drunk and ended up feeling really unwell from the wine. If you book this wine tasting be prepared for quantity not necessarily quality. You definitely get value for your money."

We were in Buenos Aires on Christmas Day and found that, unsurprisingly, a great many of the usual attractions (museums, historical sites, restaurants, etc.) were closed. What to do on a major holiday in a foreign city? We ran across the Anuva Wines name on-line and found that they had wine tastings scheduled, despite the fact that it was a major holiday. We submitted our request for a reservation mere hours before the tasting began and received a prompt e-mail confirmation.A couple of hours later, we were in a taxi, looking for the mysterious unmarked door in the Palermo district that led to the Anuva loft. We found the correct street number and the door, rang the bell and waited. It all felt very cloak and dagger, like something out of a novel or a movie. But once inside, we got a completely different vibe.The staff of Anuva are warm and friendly. The ambience is sort of an upscale industrial chic. The decor and layout of this place remind me of the loft apartment of a successful 20- or 30-something urban professional. We found ourselves seated around one of three large wooden tables, with a varied group of other travelers from around the world.But what about the wine? Well, I'm glad you asked, because it was excellent. Anuva features mostly lesser known boutique wines from around Argentina. We didn't see most of the brands they offered in the many wine shops we visited around Buenos Aires. And, like smaller wineries and breweries in the US, many of these labels are clearly overlooked gems. Too small to get major distribution (yet), Anuva has picked them up and is starting to market them to an international audience.Diego, our sommelier for the afternoon, was a knowledgeable and fun tour guide. There were five wines, each paired with different types of tapas, from meats and cheeses to empanadas to dark chocolates. They offer generous pours and will top you off mutliple times with your favorite wines. The variety of wines was intriguing too, as we went beyond the Malbec that makes Argentina famous and looked at several whites and a red blend or two as well. We had a wonderful experience and ordered several bottles to be delivered to us back in the US when we returned home. There is no high-pressure sales pitch, but a price list of the items we sampled was offered at the end.This was a nice Christmas present that we gave ourselves."

Just where this interesting wine-tasting concept is located is not revealed until you pay for your visit. Even then, address in hand, it can be hard to find this well- disguised location. Although one of our group was frustrated iabout the hunt, I found it all part of the elan. This venue by a Portland, Oregon, man who visited Argentina and met his wife and co-owner, is intriguing in its mysteriousness. I guess the absence of signage allows for only those who are interested enough to pay for the experience to be admitted. Indeed, the ten of us who tasted that late afterrnoon all seemed much more than casually interested in wine and learning more about the esoteric boutique wines of Argentina.Our host Diego seemed as well versed in the wines he was showing as enthusiatic sales room denizens in other parts of the wine world. He was geneorus in his pours and not reserved in asking if folks wanted more of what he was pouring. He was sly in pouring one Malbec from a freshly opened bottle, then when retrieving more of the same wine that he had decanted earlier. Our fellow quaffers noted its improved nose. It was a great \"aha\" when he revealed why the wine seemed to have changed so quickly. We tried a sparkling wine made with Chadonnay but also Chenin Blanc grapes (a new blend for me). We then enjoyed a tasty Torrontes from La Salta, and then a Bonarda--an interesting new grape for me and I will need to learn more about it to love it. Then we were offered a Malbec roble from Maipu--Sangiminano (NOT vernaccia). I thought this was the star of the tasting. We ended with a Carinae Riserva Malbec. Each wine was paired with perfect tapas accompaniments ranging from lucious sorbets and truffles made of chocolates from Venezuela and Ecuador to lovely domestic cheeses and charcuterie, and even an empanada. These foods showed the wines, as you would bet, in the very best light. These pairings really established the value proposition for the Anuva tasting. Our group of four would go back in a heartbeat. The fact that case lots are delivered free in the US was also a great bargain, enhancing the decently priced selections."

So you will still have to buy these icon bottles yourself :-)BUT, this is in no way any criticism, because Anuva will take you a VERY long way for the budget they are charging. Actually they are providing a very honest value.The wines they showcased were deffinitely \"the good stuff\" and are good value.The food accompanying the wines is of surprisingly good quality, too.What made our evening however was a very energetic young lady from the UK, who was not only real fun, but was a thorough proffessional who knew her stuff.When she started off I was a bit suspicios, because she seemed to be overdoing things. I realised however quite quickly that she is simply very extrovert and that she's actually being herself. In that moment I relaxed and let her do her magic. She was not only fun and charismatic, but also extremely informative in every aspect.My wife and I loved the whole experience and especially that UK lady!"

Our host, Samantha, has a degree in the field and was extremely knowledgeable about the wines, the vineyards they came from, and the business of producing and shipping wine around the world. Samantha was as detailed as we wanted her to be: the tasting was informative but also accessible. It was a pleasure to learn from her.We tried two white, one rose, and three red wines. Each was produced in Argentina (some Mendoza; some not) and each is not available internationally; many were not even available in restaurants and wine shops in Buenos Aires. They gladly poured more of any wine we especially enjoyed, and paired all the wines with appetizers. (They are correct when they say it's not a meal but you won't be disappointed with the appetizers.) The group was about eight, with a couple from the US, a family from Europe, a solo traveler from Australia, and me.I had a case of the wine sent home and I know others did as well. Anuva also offers wine clubs and you can order most (if not all) their wines from the USA and some from other locations as well.I can't end the review without commenting on the beautiful space -- a well-decorated private loft in the trendy Palermo neighborhood, just a few minutes' walk from Plaza Serrano. Like many businesses, this started out in someone's home before expanding into its own dedicated space. Highly recommended."

Every item on the tasting was excellent and very enjoyable and really did compliment the wine. 2 of the other guests at our table had dining restrictions (vegetarian & lactose intolerant) and had let Anuva know in advance, and were pleasantly surprised when special food items were brought out so that they were accommodated and could try the same wines with us.Our host was British, but had lived in B.A. for years and had a degree in this field. She was knowledgeable, personable, and friendly. Her presentation was interesting and moved along beautifully. She even had visual aids!We were also able to converse with other guests which was great fun and really enjoyable.The wines were excellent, from boutique vineyards & original, and learning about them really made us enjoy them all the more. The information provided helped us identify what it was we were liking about a wine, a useful tool for the rest of our B.A. visit as every restaurant seems to have an extensive wine list.At the end they give you an option to buy wines... I read other reviews about this, but please know that from our side we did not find it pushy AT ALL. We were grateful to have an opportunity to orders wines for ourselves and as gifts and to have them shipped back to us in the States at unbelievable prices. I even joined their wine club when I got back to the States as I really feel after the experience, that I can trust both their selections and the quality.My husband and I kept saying the rest of the trip that we could have booked the Anuva wine tasting for every night of our stay, and both fully agree that it was one of the best events we ever booked in all of our travels."

I never felt like I was by myself because Cara, who shared her expertise about the white wines, and Diego, who spoke about the red wines made you feel at home. Also, the other people at the tasting were so friendly. You don't have to know a lot about wine to come to this tasting, whether you just started learning about wine or are a wine geek. Also, they served such a variety of food pairings, from cheeses and sausage to sorbet. There was no pressure to buy any wine after the tasting, but since they shipped the wine to your home, I took advantage of that."

The owner was our guide for the day. He was very brusque, rude, cocky and impatient. He made it very well-known when we walked in that he was doing us a favor. It was slightly awkward, nevertheless, we commenced our tasting. It is not necessary to get into specifics, but he was quite insulting to a very congenial group of university academics who were nothing but fun-loving and yes, maybe a bit chatty. The disrespect he should was embarrassing. It was a little bizarre when he told one woman to put her water glass down like she was a child and scolded another for picking up their wine glass. There are ways to tell people things. This left us excruciatingly uncomfortable. This does not seem to be the case when reading the reviews with the other guides. And therefore, for this portion of our experience, I'd say just make sure one of the others lead you through the tasting. As for the rest of the experience, I'd give it three stars. It was oh kay. We did learn some, but truthfully, I felt more than a tad bit like we were at a timeshare presentation. Later on in my BA visit, I went to fine wine shops and they had different takes on some of the information dispensed at the tasting. $52 US is definitely too high for what you get as well. Maybe we would have felt more justified had we not been treated so bizarrely and poorly. There are some amazing wine shops who can give you lots of knowledge (granted they may not have the wine tasting portion), but I would sift through and see if you can find other options that may feel a bit less like your being sold something super unique when there's lots of unique wine in the area."

Although we flirted with going to Mendoza during our stay in Argentina, we just didn't have the time...so we enjoyed a delightful afternoon at Anuva Wines. Cara, our guide, was informative and entertaining. We feasted on amazing hors d'oeuvres and drank generous glasses of wonderful varieties of wine. I highly recommend this activity during your stay in Buenas Aires."

I learned a lot about the history of the Argentinean wine industry and grape varieties (note - the Malbec is the best in the world but they have great whites as well). The whole evening was really well run with numerous tastings and score cards provided so you could keep track. I ended up buying a bottle at the end of the evening for a song - I cannot remember the name of the grape/ winery but I will always remember the smoked bacon on the nose."

I noticed on their site that they recommend that guests visit at the beginning of their trip because they love giving recommendations for restaurants and activities. This was the best decision I made.We scheduled a tasting for our first full day and it did not disappoint. The wine and food pairings were awesome and the portions were perfect. Daniel was super knowledgeable and willing to dish out anything we wanted to know about Argentina and their wines. He even had a list of his favorite restaurants in the city. We went to at least 5 of his spots and each was better than the next. His printout became our bible when visiting places and ordering food. We enjoyed our tasting so much that we ordered a case of wine to be shipped home! Dan even helped us pick out some different varieties we didn't get a chance to try based on our preferences. The case of wine was delivered perfectly packed and we can't wait to reminisce about our trip with these wonderfully delicious wines.I highly recommend adding Anuva Wines to your itinerary while in Buenos Aires!"

It was the start of our week in BA and we knew very little about Argentinian wine so was the ideal opportunity to understand what to choose. The tapas were wonderful and certainly sufficient without spoiling our dinner. Great variety of wine including a very good sparkling white wine which we were't expecting.

Argentina is famously known for its wines and I was anxiously looking for a place to do some taste testing. i didn't have time to leave Buenos Aires and head to the vineyards. I was happy when I discovered the Anuva tasting in the heart of Palermo. Six different wines, paired with different appetizers. The pours are more than generous and the food was just enough to support the wine but not enough to ruin dinner. Poppy was pleasant and very knowledgeable. We had a nice cozy group of people and we all enjoyed the flowing wine. I fully recommend this bubbly break to the day."

While we found Poppi, the person leading our wine tasting to be knowledgeable, we left Anuva with a \"bad feeling\".Yes, they do offer a fairly generous pour during the actual tasting. But as others have pointed out, the tapas are small (but we've done many wine tastings in California wine country and that is pretty typical). I will say, for the quality of wine you get, it is pricey. The Cakebread food/wine tasting is $45/person, and $20/person for wine club members), and what they served were no Cakebreads... The experience itself is nice. My partner and I were at a table of eight. As it turned out, 4 couples, all from the US. (one couple was a pair of college students studying abroad in Buenos Aires, so they were significantly younger than the other three couples). The way the wine tasting is done, it was very relaxing, almost like a get together with friends.After the wine tasting was officially over, they did do their \"pitch\" for their wine club and other wines they sold, which again was ok. What we did not understand and frankly, no on in the group understood was, why they would not let us drink a bottle of wine my partner and I purchased. On the one hand, they kept coming back to the table telling us to take our time and asking us if we wanted refills. On the other hand, when we asked them to serve us the bottle we bought, they told us they had another tasting coming in soon (well, they have three, probably more empty tables, we only occupied one table so we didn't know why that should force us out--they were also turning out the lights, which led us to believe they wanted to go home, and there was not another group coming in) and so we didn't have time to drink it. One bottle poured to the six of us would have been consumed fairly quickly!!! Not to mention we all stayed there at least another 20-30 minutes after they refused to open our bottle. And, when I asked for refills, of course the wine I wanted wasn't available. The three older couples continued our festive ways and continued on to another bar. We all discussed how it made no sense not to allow us to drink our bottle--they just didn't seem genuine about their \"stay as long as you want and drink more if you want\" message. We all agreed, don't tell us to take our time and ask us if we want refills, but at the same time, then not let my partner and I drink a wine we bought that we wanted to share with the group. It definitely made us question how sincere these people were, or if it was all lip service.We did order six bottle recently from Anuva. This was because the Sommelier at Aramburu recommended the wine and said the pricing was fair. We haven't opened a bottle yet, so it will be interesting to see what we think of the wine. It's unfortunate our experience left us with a bad feeling about the place. We wanted to like it, but actions speak louder than words, and their actions were definitely strange!!!"

I thoroughly enjoyed myself during my visit to Anuva Wines for their wine tasting. This place offers tasting of wines from boutique vineyards (i.e. small production vineyards) in the Mendoza/Salta wine country region. My favorites are the whites (the sparkling Hom espumante and the Carinae torrontes) and the San Gimignano syrah. Our sommelier Cara was very friendly and knowledgeable about the wines and didn't make us feel bad that we weren't very knowledgeable about wines. Eat tasting was pared with some small bite tapas that complemented the wine. All the wines and more are very reasonably priced per bottle, can be bought by the case (I think mixed up too) and can be shipped to the U.S. Note - there are no signs to this place as the entrance is an unmarked black door. When you make your confirmation, they will give you the address. After my wine tasting experience here, I wish I made more time in Argentina to visit wine country at Mendoza and la Salta!"

Unfortunately, all three Malbec wines provided during the tasting were about as bad as I have ever tasted, and I had heard of none of them previously. Anuva's spin on this is that they have found \"undiscovered\" excellent little vintners with outstanding wines that the lucky customer can purchase from Anuva. Their business model appears to be to get you to believe the wines they sell are grand, and to have you order a case or three at the end of the tasting. For $52 you will be much better off going to a nice restaurant and ordering two or three bottles of something that is actually a good wine, plus pay for your bife de lomo. Also went to a wine tasting at Lo de Joaquin Alberti, which was much better, not the least because the wines were actually good. Lo de Joaquin are far more knowledgeable about Argentinian wines, and carry a broad array of classic and hard to find (but good) Malbecs."

There was absolutely no pressure for this sale. We took them up on the offer and purchased a case. Earlier in the day we had stopped by a large liquor store and inquired about shipping wine home to the U.S. They said they woudl not because it was too expensive.

Once the hostess came down to greet us, we ascended the staircase to a spacious and bright loft with the table set for all of the folks attending. Our hostess was very personable and energetic and engaging. She poured the wine explaining the history of each one, the types of varietals used, and the notes we should taste and smell. Then a small service of food was presented to complement each of the five wines in turn. All in all, the food was great, the wine was better, and the presentation and hostess brought it all together.

We discovered wines from small bodegas that are not available in wine stores. Thanks to Anuva, we also met wonderful people. The Anova\u2019s experience was a highlight of our stay in BA. At the end, we were ready to tango.Paul"

Our hostess was very informative and answered any questions we asked. She was also very generous with the pours of each wine. We were even allowed refills in the end (can\u2019t complain about that!). We were served 5 different wines (a sparkling, a white, and three reds) along with 5 authentic Argentine tapas including empanadas, sorbets, and local meats and cheese. YUM! What was unique about this wine tasting is the wines selected are from small boutique wineries, so you can\u2019t find these wines just anywhere, which made the tasting feel extra special. It was also nice to meet and drink wine with other travelers with whom we were able to share stories of our Buenos Aires adventures! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a unique experience in Buenos Aires."

My boyfriend and I wanted to attend a wine tasting during our first visit to Argentina, so we reserved spots for one of Anuva's evening tastings and were welcomed into a beautiful, modern loft space in Palermo (definitely my favorite neighborhood in Buenos Aires!). Our group, which included about a dozen people, was seated promptly at two spacious dining tables, and the event was conducted entirely in English. Our host was gracious, knowledgeable, and very professional; I felt like I learned a lot of interesting facts about the history and reasoning behind various local winemaking processes. The wines were lovely, but my favorite part was the pairings\u2014they were thoughtfully selected, with nice surprises from chocolate to empanadas. They also provide unlimited refills, which makes for great value!"

            "review": "Best Wine Tasting and Pairing I've done. A normal wine tasting involves 2-3 wines and some cheese. Anuva knows that people drink many different types of wine and understands that food and wine can complement each other very well. They serve food that people actually would eat with each wine pairing. Yes, that means different types of cheese with some. But they also have beef and chocolate to pair with other wines. You end up with multiple food tastings with each wine you sample. It is not a giant meal, this is essentially appetizers but the flavor pairings are excellent. On top of that, they will introduce you to some wines that you do not know - vineyards and grape variety. If you want a very different wine tasting experience and one that level of wine drinker will learn many things and have a very enjoyable time - try Anuva. The layout of the tasting is also set up where all the guests can talk to each other and discussion flows. Even the geography of the Argentina is discussed. I tell all my friends traveling to B.A. that this is the place to visit. Staff is very knowledgable and they take great care in selecting their wines to offer. What is great is you can do this tour six times, and taste all new wines each time. So first time or fourth time, you will still learn more."

They host intimate wine tasting events in Palermo, introducing visitors to high-quality wines from small wineries, many of which barely export and are extremely limited in production. Their wine tastings are offered at a variety of days and times, and we opted for a 2pm Saturday tasting because we day-drink like that. We were lucky enough to book a time with Cara as our host. She knows her stuff. And she provides detailed background on wine regions, characteristics, and processes in a simple and approachable way, without making you feel at all ashamed for previously viewing Two Buck Chuck as a special occasion wine. Each wine comes with a small food pairing to complement and enhance the flavors. There is plenty of vino to be had and you\u2019ll not be left wanting for heavier pours."

She is witty and quick with loads of charm and knowledge. She not only presented all of the wines with in-depth commentary but also helped guide the conversation, dispensed invaluable advice on seeing BA, and most importantly-kept the wine flowing. Generous pours is an understatement. They also helped me get a case sent back to Hawaii without breaking the bank. We were able to have our own Argentine wine-tasting with friends when we got back home. If I'm ever back in BA,I'll be sure to look up Anuva Wines. Thanks again, Cara!

Unlike some places we've been previously, they offered top-ups from the open bottles, so you could have a fair amount of the wines that you liked. One nice thing was that if you enjoyed a specific bottle, they offer shipping if you have a US address. Note that you sit at tables of 8 people, so I guess your experience could depend a little on who you are sitting with; in our case we had very nice couples with us, which enhanced the experience."

Your host, Cara, is a wealth of information and peppers the tasting with wit, while she tells you about the exclusive wines that you get to taste. You will taste 2 whites and 3 reds and there are small bites of food that are paired with each wine. Cara will answer any questions you have about the wines, which are exclusive because of their small production.  Most of the wines are not available in markets but you are free to make a purchase at the end of the tasting if you wish but there is no pressure to do so. We met some great people who shared the table with us, there were six of us in total. We planned to visit Cafayete & Mendoza, the wine growing regions in Argentina, so for us this was a perfect introduction of what was to come.

This was a great experience for our group of 3, but would also be perfect for couples or larger groups. We continued on from Buenos Aires to Mendoza City where we spent two days sampling wines directly at the vineyards. I would recommend Anuva wines for travelers who want a warm-up to Mendoza or who won't have the time (or money) to spend going their directly.

Overall Anuva was really on top of everything -- organized, nice and offered an awesome atmosphere in a gorgeous location. Their wine prices were excellent as well, had tons of different options and were stocked with everything! Loved my entire experience with them, recommend to anyone looking for a good wine tasting in Buenos Aires!"

I went with my boyfriend, and we were both pleasantly surprised. I would definitely recommend. Their choice of wine, wine pairings, and insight into wine tasting was amazing. A must do. The wine portions were generous, and you could ask for second pourings if you wanted. I was not interested in purchasing wine and was in a hurry, so when the activity finished I had to leave immediately. Everyone was very friendly and many of the other guest stayed to purchase wine or just mingle. By no means do they make you feel that you have to make a purchase. To the contrary, our hostess was very professional and friendly.Nevertheless, it was a pity that I did not make a purchase,because two of the red wines were phenomenal."

We were warmly greeted by Rachel upon entering the building and instantly felt like very special guests when we saw how beautifully decorated the tasting room was. The wines did not disappoint and neither did the tapas, which were all nicely presented and paired quite well with each of the wines. I\u2019m definitely still a novice, but this experience was helpful in expanding my ability to detect new notes in wines and moving beyond describing only the taste and smell \u2013 I learned how to pay attention to weight and color as well. The conversation was very good too; we met some very interesting people and overall had a nice afternoon.The only con I would mention is that our wine tasting felt a bit rushed. I realize that we were scheduled only for a specific time slot, but maybe it would help to add some cushion time so it doesn\u2019t feel like the conversation is being abruptly brought to an end at times. Other than that, it was professionally-run and the presentation and ambience were very nice \u2013 each detail was impeccable from the lay-out of the table to our hostess\u2019s attire. Thanks, Anuva!"

The food pairings went well -- especially enjoyed the empanadas!!

A lot of wine tours or tastings I have gone to just have you try a few and that's really it, but Anuva Wines was super relaxed and offered seconds to anyone who wanted. 150% recommend to anyone looking for a totally different wine experience, meet people and to learn a thing or two! I walked away with two bottles and a few new friends in BA, I really loved it!"

I was a little apprehensive about going to the tasting as I consider myself a bit of a wine & food snob, but I really had a good time and thought the wines, as well as the food pairings, were good. I was surprised at how much wine and food we actually received based on some other reviews. We were able to have more of any of the wines we wished. The food, while not necessarily dinner sized, was appropriate for the tasting and didn't leave me wanting more. The presentation was informative and fun.I did not feel any sales pressure to buy at the end of the night, but the wines were certainly available for purchase. The loft was a really nice space and the directions for the location made it easy to find. I would definitely recommend this experience to anyone heading to Buenos Aires. It is appropriate for both couples or friends/business associates."

The experience definitely lived up to the rating. Upon arriving at the Anuva Wines tasting room, you're seated at a casual yet intimate dining table with interesting, curious travelers from all over the world (all English-speaking). Then, an extremely knowledgeable and personable wine expert walks everybody through 6-7 different wines (coupled with nice, appetizer-sized food pairings). The guide provides a crash-course in wine tasting and peppers the conversation with interesting history and funny quips. All in all, the wines were delicious, the info was intriguing, the company was great, and the experience was most definitely a memorable one. At the end, you can even order some of the wines provided during the tasting. So excited to receive my Bonarda! Kudos to the Anuva Wine management and staff for coming up with such a cool thing to do in Argentina. Highly recommended."

Our session was run by Rachel, a young (but very knowledgable) American woman with a prodigious passion for wine. The five wines chosen were mostly very good, although the opening bottle - a sparkling - did little to convince me of the merits of Argentine bubbly. Those that followed - a torrentes, a bonarda, and two malbecs - were all top-notch though; indeed it was quite wonderful to drink small-quantity wines of such quality, all superbly matched with food. Even as a solo traveller, I didn't find it an awkward experience at all, although I'm admittedly not the most retiring type. I'd recommend this experience to just about anyone - even those who (quietly) consider themselves wine buffs would find enough here of interest for it to be a worthwhile experience."

It's in a kind of dicey-meets-avant-garde neighborhood in Palermo Soho, and not particularly close to a subte station. Our hosts were British but had been living and working wine in Argentina for quite some time and their knowledge showed. The awkwardness I think came not from her but from throwing a number of strangers together - two couples and me (but I was glad they could fit me in), not sure what to say or when, how much wine to drink and so forth. It got looser over the two hours though. What I really liked was that they showcased five wines and none is available in the U.S., which meant I was trying wines friends had never tasted! I loved that it wasn't five malbecs, and that the host explained very well not just the region, but also the history, terroir (why some grapes worked in Argentina but not France, for example), information about the vintners, and so forth. I'm not a white wine person but the white chosen was amazing. The malbec was really good - I've had my share here, and this one was much softer and lesser tannens than most, which is a good thing. I loved that there were two flagship wines of Argentina (not malbecs). We were seemingly unlimited in the amount of wine poured. The pairings were chosen carefully and we were able to discuss the effect of the food on the wine, led by our host. I had registered that I don't eat pork, and they accommodated that request for me. (Well, they didn't substitute something for the sausages that others got, they just put separate cheese on a plate for me, although I could have eaten the cheese off the communal plate - but maybe some non-pork-eaters wouldn't even do that.)"

I attended the Anuva Wines wine tasting a couple of weeks back and I would highly recommend it to anyone in Buenos Aires - tourists and locals alike! I have been living here in Buenos Aires for around 2 years and it is so so nice to go out receive absolutely excellent service, while learning about a passion... fine wine! I have spent a lot of time tasting different wines, but this evening was extremely informative, without impacting at all the level of enjoyment... I felt totally spoilt and will not forget this evening of laughter and great company! Thank you to everyone from the Anuva team!"

We tasted five flights of wine, two white (one sparkling) and three red. The food pairings were bruschetta with a nice Roquefort with pear and walnut, amazing peach and lemon sorbet to accompany the white and a traditional empanada, cheese and salami, and chocolate to accompany the red. The pours are generous and refills are encouraged. Even through some rather dochey ramblings from my table mates about the wines and their flavors this was a wonderful experience and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good glass of wine, great food, and light history lesson about the history of wine in Argentina."

I had my reservations about this place since they wouldn't announce the address until after we had put down a deposit for a reservation. It was all explained and made sense afterwards. We lucked out and happened to be the only group at the time. We tried an espumante, white, and three reds. Each were paired with a food choice that was also excellent. It was also nice to see that they offered more wine after you were done your tasting. They also ship wine for you, which is great since not a lot of wine stores in BA offer this service."

You get lead up to a nice loft where there is a table with set up for the tastings. So my hopes were high...everything looked professional and the staff was very friendly. But once we started tasting the wines and the tapas I was less and less impressed. Each wine was on average just OK. Nothing exciting...nothing I would care to retry or even want to buy. Especially for the prices they were asking. I know I can find a nicer Argentinian wine at Trader Joes! And for the tasting fees of $45 USD it was not worth it. I would not recommend this. Rather just go to a local wine store and buy a bottle...you will be happier with the wine!"

The nibblies they bring out are not going to fill you up, but are well-considered to pair with the wines you are tasting. Aside from that, the space in Palermo is lovely. Bright and spacious, it really puts you in the right mood. The lovely hostess Sarah really completes the experience. She is highly knowledgeable about the wines, speaks a great deal and without hesitation about every wine that is brought out, and answers questions in an equally confident manner, whether they are about the wine industry, Mendoza, Buenos Aires or Argentina in general.

It said that at Anuva Wines we would learn about \"terroirs varietals, vinification'. and that here were \"generous, endless pours\". The web-site is very vague as to where they are located. Even when you ask them via email, they are evasive. This would be helpful to know when you plan your vacation. They have recently moved to a new location in Palermo. It is a nice place with lots of sunshine streaming in and a a long, steep staircase to get there.The set-up looked promising, all very clean and modern. It is nondescript from the outside; you truly wonder if you have the right address. Apparently, this is to prevent \"walk-ins\".We were greeted by David, a rather introverted fellow, who seemed anxious to get the whole thing over with, in my opinion. I asked if he was a sommelier. He said no and quickly changed the topic. Seems to me someone who is in the wine business and is giving a wine presentation should be properly trained. It was obvious he had a script to adhere to. He said a sentence or two about each wine, but not much about the terroir of Argentina. We quickly realized this was all about SELLING the wines they chose to present. The food pairings were interesting. When we finished the whites, the 3 reds were poured all at the same time. We felt rushed. I asked why they were all poured together, and David said that was so we could compare the colors; fair enough, but we never did talk about this. As for the endless pours, with a small group of about eight tasting a bottle , the endless pour consists of finishing said bottle. I do understand this is a tasting , not a dinner party, but do not be mistaken, no other bottles were opened.After his spiel, order forms were quickly distributed. How many bottles did we want of each? Perhaps the monthly wine club is more your thing? This is not a relaxing \"Learn about Argentinian Wines\" evening, this is a hard sell publicity stunt. That they charge you to attend is outrageous! If this is what you want, then I recommend it; but only IF if you live in the USA, because they don't ship anywhere else.I have visited other wine-tastings and have never been charged. For $46, I expected to learned something about the Argentinian wine culture, not just Anuva Wines export business.Perhaps if you know nothing about wines at all , you might enjoy this; other-wise, I recommend you visit \"Terroir\". They are an exclusive, very knowledgeable and helpful wine store.. Here you will find wines unavailable abroad or elsewhere."

Five wines (sparkling, Torrontes, Bonardo, Malbec, Red blend) carried by Anuva Wines, a distributor with exclusive license for North America. Very nice accompanying food--not enough for dinner but much more than ususal with wine tasting. The price is fair at $46US/person. They have just moved to a new setting which is very pretty. We will make this a weekly event as long as they can keep changing the wine menu.Wines can be ordered for shipment to US at reasonable cost."

We enjoyed a very relaxing 2 hours with Sarah learning about some of the lesser known but higher end wines and wineries in Argentina. 2 whites and 3 reds including excellent food pairings for each. Very clean, comfortable, modernized setting in Palermo. Not easy to find but don't let that deter you. Being from California and having experienced many wine tastings, this was unique in that it wasn't at a winery. Regardless, this proved to be a great experience.Sitting fee was 46 USD, not limited to one glass of each. Average price range per bottle was $18-35. Buy 12 get 2 free. Higher than some, but not having a feel for Argentinian, this was worth the time. Shipping available at $42/case. P.S. Signage on the door would help!"

It was a small tasting group (6 total) and we tried 5 different wines, demonstrating Argentina's wide range (a sparkling wine, a torrontes, a bonarda, a malbec and a blend). The wines were all delicious and they were each paired with something to compliment the wines (cheese, sausage, sorbet, empanada, etc.). And while I enjoyed the wines and the pairings greatly, the real highlight is the staff at Anuva. Cara was really good - she was what a teacher should be. She is obviously very knowledgable (she was able to answer every question with enough detail to satisfy the questioner). She was very friendly - not too formal, not too informal. I would definitely attend another tasting at Anuva (and likely will on my next trip to BA."

That said, we loved the wines, the pairings were just right, we had a really great group that interacted well and included serious foodies; the presentation was by a young woman from the U.S. such that there were no language issues; and the location was easy for us since we were staying in the Palermo neighborhood and could walk the couple blocks to the showroom. After the program, we were offered the wines for purchase. The wines we tasted were not cheap and the average price per bottle of the wines we purchased (including $42 shipping and $20 sales tax for the case) was $28. I was rather hoping that since we made a case purchase that at least a portion of the $92 ($46x2) tasting fee would be eliminated. That said, we had a very fun evening and will have a case of fine wine to enjoy as we reminisce about our trip to Buenos Aires."

We went as a pair and there was only one other couple at our tasting. Unfortunate for us, they were not hugely excited about being there. We loved the wine and experience but definitely dampened by our fellow tasters.Location: I believe Anuva's location is mixed. We were staying in BA's microcenter area, a 20-40min ride by collectivo to the Palermo location of Anuva. So, if you aren't staying in Palermo I certainly recommend that you plan your entire evening in the Palermo area. The specific blocks around Anuva are up and coming, so that is bitter sweet as well.Overall: Anuva exposed us to small, otherwise unknown wineries. Your tasting-guru should have wonderful storied about the wineries themselves and the formulations of the individual wines. I didn't find our 3 hours to be a typical wine tasting - like european style, but more a story and exposure to local wines. Fun and interesting."

They have relationships with a number of small Argentinian producers, whose wines they both offer for tasting and sale in Buenos Aires, and also import into the U.S.Thus, you can buy the wines you taste (or others on their list) and have them shipped to your U.S. address from Anuva's warehouse in Nevada. You must buy 12 bottles, but they knock off the price of the least-expensive two, which usually about pays for the $45.00 shipping fee from Nevada.Anuva's tastings are held in the bar/restaurant at the Rendezvous Hotel, a charming, tiny boutique Hotel in Palermo Hollywood. (Although Anuva's clientele is entirely English-speaking, from what I saw, the hotel's clientele seems to be French-speaking.) Our tasting had about 8 people; it was very social, with lots of opportunity to compare notes not only on the wines, but also on the experience of visiting Buenos Aires. The tasting was led by an American woman in her twenties who clearly knew her stuff. And I use the word \"led\" advisedly. She provided subtle but useful education and guidance to the less-experienced, explaining how to sample the wine, what aromas might appear in the bouquet, etc., etc. Our tasting started with a sparking wine, then progressed through a Torront\u00e9s to three red wines, one of which, a Bonarda, is not usually available as a single varietal. Each wine is paired with a few bites of a complementary food. For us, as diabetics, Anuva substituted Brie for the sorbet they would have ordinarily served; I think they can also do gluten-free (but ask).The tasting was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of pre-dinner hours. We learned something about Argentinian wine, and we bought some to have shipped home. Although you can probably select from a wider variety of wines to taste elsewhere in Buenos Aires (and certainly at The Vines of Mendoza, in Mendoza), I'd recommend Anuva for any American with an interest in Argentinian wines.

You also get a guided tour of the wineries. Now you tell me whether Anuva is worth it. A rip off, I say.

With so much fabulous wine in the area, we thought there would be so many opportunities, but that wasn't the case. We chose Anuva because it sounded like a fun wine tasting. We booked just a few days in advance, and had our hotel telephone for us. The day we wanted wasn't available because there was a group scheduled already, but the 2nd choice of date worked out fine. We did not book ahead as we were in Buenos Aires for 10 days and had some flexibility in our schedule, but if you are there for a shorter stay I would suggest that you reserve from home on their web site. We took the subway to Plaza Italia and walked, because we wanted to explore the Palermo neighborhood. Everyone else arrived by taxi. Even though we were on the correct block, we walked by the Rendezvous Hotel entrance at least twice before we figured out where it was. The signs are small for many hotels here. There ended up being 9 people total on that day. Our wine taster, Sara from Ohio, was very sweet. She poured 5 different wines, and a few were paired with small tasting items- a spread on a toast, sorbet, small bites of cheese and cured meats, an empanada, and chocolate. We tried one sparkling, one white and three reds. They were all good choices, and we especially enjoyed the Bonarda, which we would compare favorably to a Cabernet Franc grape. We had never had that variety before, and started searching in out in Buenos Aires restaurants. Anuva Wines does distribute wines to the United States, and they offer a wine package or wine club that you can order. We did not order any wines, as we already have other wine clubs at home that keep us well-stocked for our needs at this time, but it would be a great way to keep trying wines from smaller bodgeas in Argentina that you would otherwise not be able to get in the US. We thought the price was a bit high at $46 per person, but it seems like things in Buenos Aires are always leaning towards very much less or very much more expensive than we would have predicted. We had so much fun at the tasting, and went for drinks and a light dinner after the tasting with 3 of the other people we met that afternoon, and that was so enjoyable. There was a handout with some suggested restaurants, and we had a great experience with Anuva Wine. We have experience with wine tasting in a variety of settings. Keep in mind that this is an overall educational experience learning about some Argentinean wines and bodegas, with an emphasis on the educational aspects, and not a swill some wine and move on type of thing. You'll be there for about 2 hours. It's a tasting, not drinking event, but I think between the 9 of us we did finish off just about all 5 of the bottles with refills as we were going along. I would suggest this outing for people who are already somewhat knowledgeable about wine and wine varieties, and who are willing to spend a bit more to get a thoughtful experience. I would not suggest this outing for the extreme budget minded tourists or someone with no wine background at all- you might not be able to appreciate the differences in wine styles and may come away dissapointed. We fit into the first category and had a blast. Choose according to your tastes and style."

Sarah, who spoke fluent English guided us through five delicious and different wines that we would otherwise never know or dare to try. Paired with each wine was a delicious amuse bouche - in particular the empendas were the best I had in BA! Plus, the pour was generous so we could go back and reevaluate our favorites and rediscover each wine after it had breathed. Plus, we were able to order the bottles delivered to the US! Could not have been a more enjoyable experience (and as a bonus, Sarah directed us towards great shopping!)"

I recently was in Buenos Aires on business when consequently it was my birthday so our logistics provider was kind enough to have scheduled a wine tasting with Anuva wines. The group was quite large so they reserved a private tasting at a great little bar called \"Magdalena's Party\". It was a lovely setting and the pairings they provided for the six different wines we tasted were amazing. Each one was quite an experience. The wine expert we had at our table, Sarah Bons was just so knowledgeable and patience with us. We were quite a loud group of Americans from all over the United States and lucky for the bar owners, we weren't disturbing other people's meal or bar thanks to Sarah and her ability to captivate her audience. The wine I fell in love with was the Bonarda - Mairena which, according to Sarah, was named after the owner's daughter. It is a very robust wine made with cherries, plums and blackberries...the best wine to have with a steak dinner! it was so good I came back to the states and have plans to buy a case for the holidays...guess what everyone is getting for Christmas this year!?"

The hotel location is within Palermo (where we were already staying) and was a very cool interior. Cara was helpful and informative, and we went through 5 tasting that were each paired with food. The food serving size was not large, but sufficient enough that my wife and I felt we did not need to go out for a meal after. The wines were delicious, and Cara refilled our glasses upon request. The setting was quiet, which we enjoyed so that we could talk and meet the other patrons at Anuva.All in all, something I would definitely recommend early on in your trip to Buenos Aires! What made this experience special was that we really hit it off with another young couple attending the same wine tasting."

It was great to try a bonarda and a torrontes - the five wines we sampled were a great intro to argentine wine before our trip to Mendoza. Definitely do this at the start of your trip, so you can look out for varietals/brands you enjoyed.Also wasn't too salesy at the end - you can ship wine or take bottles away with you, but neither were pushed on you.

The registration (same day) was simple, the location at the Rendezvous Hotel in Palermo was excellent, and the host, Sarah Bons, was fun and very knowlegable. Most importantly, we were treated to five fantastic wines from smaller Argentine vineyards. There were four other participants during our tasting and it was really interesting to compare and contrast each wine with everyone else. I was hesitant going into the tasting that it might be a big sales pitch by Anuva to purchase the wine, but it turned out to be a very low-key approach. Of course they would like you to purchase wine, but there was absolutely no arm-twisting. In the end, my wife and I purchased two cases but it was simply because we loved the wine so much. Try this activity as a great introduction into one of the great wine regions of the world!"

Wine is something which has always intrigued me about Argentina and I love perusing the shelves at supermercados and wine stores and selecting between high quality brands and various unique Malbec brands at extremely affordable prices.I felt like I wanted to start checking out the more high quality wineries which have an even greater selection but which charge higher prices as well. In order to truly know what I like and don\u2019t like, and which bargains are better than others I felt like I could use some more hands on information. Everything I had heard about tastings and hands on wine education was outside of the city in Mendoza, Salta, and other wine producing regions which I didn\u2019t have the time nor energy to go visit. A little more research and help from TripAdvisor found Anuva Wines and before I knew it I was at the Palermo hotel sitting down for a tasting.Anuva was truly excellent. It was easy to sign up and it offered some incredible wine from those same important and farther away wine producing regions which I had always heard of. I learned all about HOW to taste a wine, what to look for, and how to differentiate between common Argentine wines. Things I never knew before. The wine was delicious and varied, and accompanied by food pairings which \u201caccentuate certain characteristics.\u201d The info on the creation process as well as the wineries themselves was surprising and interesting. I would go back and do the whole thing again. Not to mention that the wine they offer is hard to find anywhere else in the city."

I wish I could give the same raving reviews as I below but unfortunately my experience was not that spectacular... in fact, I was really underwhelmed by it all. I took my boyfriend and uncle who is visiting from Australia at the moment and we shared the table with three others. Half our group were spanish speakers and the other half were english speakers. This made for a really disjointed discussion but my boyfriend and I tried to translate as best we could between the two conversations.The information we were given about the wines weren't any more than we could have read from the label of the bottle, even when we tried to encourage more information from the expert. We would have been better off putting our money towards some good bottles of wine and talking amongst ourselves. The accompanying food was really average as well. For the money it wasn't worth the visit. Save your money up and go to Mendoza or visit one of the great wine stores who will happily discuss the varieties of wines with you for free."

It's also expensive (for Argentina) and they want to sell you some of the wine (which is the point of a tasting!). However, we had a fabulous night out and I'd recommend it to anybody except the complete wine buff. Sarah and David ran a good tasting and had chosen some really unusual Argentinian wines for us to try. We tried two grapes I'd never tried before and enjoyed some Argentinian sparkling and of course, some Malbec. They weren't shy at topping up and offered some tasty food pairings to accompany the wines. They also offered some great restaurant and bar tips which came in very handy.While they probably weren't the most knowledgable wine experts I've ever met they more than made up for it by being hugely friendly, laid back and good fun. Their approach really suits the Argentinian style and we met some really nice people who we kicked on for a few drinks with. What more can you want from a night out? Treat it more as a fun night out than an education and you will not be disappointed."

I recently visited Buenos Aires with a couple friends and read reviews of a few wine tasting services in the city and am SO happy we chose to go to Anuva. David, who is really knowledgeable of Argentine wine, but also very nice, led the tasting. He prepared a small food pairing to go with each wine, and was able to recommend other foods that would go well with each grape, which is helpful for me. At the end of the tasting we got restaurant recommendations, which were the best places we tried on the trip. One other prop was that David was both completely fluent in Spanish and in English--I felt like a wine pro when I left, able to use some of the more educated wine terminology. Even better, I was able to buy some of the delicious wine to bring home--especially since it is currently not imported by the United States, where I'm from. Aunva was also located in Palermo Hollywood, in the heart of Buenos Aires' where all the best shopping and restaurants are concentrated. On Saturday's and Sunday's there is even a fair in Palermo so I'd recommend you do the wine tasting on the weekends (They are open seven days a week!), grab a bite for lunch, then walk around to do some real artesan shopping! The Anuva wine tasting was so much fun and I learned more than I ever imagined about wine, the culture of Argentina, and let's face it, the wine was pretty good too ;)"

We had read it was good, but were blown away by what we got!!First of all, we were unable to make one of their available times due to the time our flight was arriving (we were leaving early the next morning) and they worked with us to start at a time we could make. Amazing.From the beginning they were very reliable via email contact and answered all of my questions about shipping, timing, and confirmed my vegetarian pairing.When we arrived they were able to lock up our luggage for us (we came straight from the airport). They were very friendly, helpful, and made the tasting amazing. They explained each wine (very knowledgeable) and the pairings that went with them. It was not a stingy sample either. Very laid back with the wines!I've been to tastings in Napa Valley California, the Loire valley in France, Champagne in France, Italy, and Chile. This tasting was by far the best overall!!!Just a few tips.If you book, there is a minimum amount of time that you have to cancel by or they will charge you anyway (one of our friends couldn't make it last minute and we had to pay for her)If you want to ship to Canada they can't do it. But they were able to work with me to ship it to my cousin's place in the USA.Really fabulous!! Definitely do this if you're in Buenos Aires!!"

We tasted 5 wines from small wineries not available in the US, and each was paired with a traditional Argentine food. All the wines were great, and a couple were varieties I'd never seen in stores or restaurants. My favorite part of the tasting was how fun, relaxed and un-pretentious it was compared to other tastings I've done before. Sarah and David (both fluent in English) who lead the tastings are extremely knowledgable of wine, and I'm sure could answer the most obscure wine related questions if you ask. They are also very friendly and made the experience feel comfortable, as if we were with long-time friends. Except we had the added bonus of learning all about Argentina in the process.

I love wine, so I was looking forward to the opportunity to try some new Argentinian wines that weren't from the major vintners, and that is just what Anuva shared with us. We sampled some interesting wines, most of which were very good, including a surprising new favorite of mine, a torrontes. I'm a red wine fan, but the torrontes immediately evoked summer sun and relaxation. As my husband and I and the other participants tried the wines and got descriptions about the vintners and the grapes, we were presented with delicious food pairings to complement the wines, which by the way, were generous pours!The two young women who hosted the wine tasting that evening were both knowledgeable, charming, and good at putting people at ease. Delightful hosts! We had a great experience with purchasing wine through Anuva, too. Our order arrived just a few days after we got home and was in perfect condition; it was shipped at a reasonable cost, and we were sent emails about its shipping throughout the process. It couldn't have gone smoother!Finally, the hotel the wine tasting was held in is a charmer too! We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would recommend it as a great introduction to different Argentinian wines."

The empandada was soooo good. Best of all was the host: she was a wealth of knowledge on Argentine culture, the city of Buenos Aires, the wines of Argentina... she was helpful with much more than just wine knowledge, which was a pleasant surprise! We connected with some tourists and made a few friends from the tasting as well, (a nice perk, and easy to do because it was such a small tasting) and have enjoyed trying all of the suggested restaurants that were on a paper they gave us.

Angry emails were sent, a dozen nasty names were called, threats were made, etc. (what can I say? Don\u2019t mess with my wine). Just as steam began to pour from my ears, Daniel shipped us all 12 bottles of wine at his cost, along with a great, big helping of humble pie. I don\u2019t know exactly what caused the confusion \u2013 my own assumptions, his changes in policy, neither of us asking the right questions \u2013 but in the end, good customer service, a deep devotion to excellent wine and a gracious host prevailed.

We had food pairings with each wine, and each food pairing was something Argentinean as well. The best part about Anuva (if you live in the US) is that they have a warehouse in the US filled with all of their Argentinean wines, so at the end of the tasting we ordered a case of wine each and didn't have to pay for shipping all the way from Argentina. I would absolutely recommend Anuva - even if you do make it to Argentinean wine country, it's a great way to get exposed to smaller wineries you may not have visited."

On top of the wines, the food pairings were also great. We highly recommend Anuva Wines to anyone that either lives in Argentina, or is just here visiting."

Dan guided us through numerous wines paired with tasty appetizers - empanadas, cheeses, sausages, and so on. The white wines were good, but the red wines were fantastic. Dan shared his considerable knowledge of the wines and wine-growing regions in a very friendly and relaxed manner. This was like going to a party with friends - and learning quite a bit in the process. I did end up buying some wine and having it shipped home but I didn't feel pressured to do it - I usually buy some local wine when I travel and this made it very easy to get gifts for friends as well as some for myself. I highly recommend this experience and would definitely do it again!"

After hearing and tasting some amazing wines throughout my holiday through south america i got to Buenos Aires determined to do some wine tasting to find out more about the range available. Anuva Wines were incredibly easy to book and go along to. Dan introduced us (a group of both spanish and english speakers) to six different types of wines, all chosen by a group of blind tasters from a variety of vineyards, all of which were delicious and unique. Each wine was paired with a different food to complement the taste, information about the wine, its region and history was explained and then the details were emailed to us (for those of us with fuzzy memories after the generous portions of wine we consumed during the evening!!). The people i met there were delightful, it was located in a safe and easy to find part of town and it definately satisfied my interest in the wines of south america. I would recommend it as a must do when in Buenos Aires. Thanks guys!!"

As a non-drinker, I was hoping to understand a little more about types of wine, differences in taste, and the correct combinations of wine and food.Our host, Sara, met all my expectations - she was hospitable, attentive, helpful and knowledgeable, and gave me lots of individual attention. Her assistant Koko was also very nice. Even for me it was a very enjoyable evening, and others in my group had an even better time discussing the different wines.So in a nut shell - a pleasant and memorable evening that was a unique experience during my two weeks in Buenos Aires. If you are into wine or just want to learn a bit more about it - this can be a good fun."

Located in a charming boutique hotel in Palermo, Anuva's wine tasting was so lovely, that when it ended all the guests lingered for forty-five minutes, savoring the delightful experience.Six delicious Argentine wines were sampled: one sparkling, one white and four red. Each wine was paired with an equally scrumptious food to complement it. Explanations of the wines, given by owner Daniel, were educational and entertaining. His passion for wine is contagious, and his charismatic presentation of hand-selected wines is the finishing touch on an already perfect experience.Anuva prepares a spread and presentation that can be appreciated by wine novice and expert alike. One will learn about the entire wine making process - from grape harvesting to the scientific properties of wine's chemical compounds, to bottling, aging and exporting. Whether you're a foodie, wine affectionado or tourist, Anuva's wine tasting is a memorable experience of Buenos Aires, through the rosy view of a bottomless wineglass."

As a novice wine drinker and for someone who doesn't particularly drink wine as the drink of choice per se, the wine tasting experience from the ambience, culture insights, wine tasting experience and the staff was overall excellent. The owner of the firm-Daniel was present and you could see the personalized touch of their service. Select Argentinian wines were paired with diverse food groups, the knowledge of which I could then use on my own when experimentating the restaurants in the city. This is definitely on my list of experiences on my next visit. Cheers to Daniel and his team."

I always enjoy wine tastings in order to taste new wines and learn something new, but Anuva allows the tasters to make it an experience of their own. Even if you don't like wines, you should give it a go. First off, the tasting is held in a chic hotel in Palermo amongst the best restaurants in the city (perfect locale for dinner after the tasting) adding to the overall feel and mood of the experience. Our guide educated everyone at the table, even the aficionados with insights into the Argentine vineyards, grapes, and culture. We tasted 6 wines all distinct in taste along with 6 traditional dishes to get a taste for the Argentine palate. Whether you are staying in Buenos Aires for a quick visit or a long stay, try the Anuva tasting. We even had people at our table who didn't drink wine, but still enjoyed hearing about the vineyards and country while tasting the empanadas and gourmet chocolate."

Our wine host, Sarah, was clearly tired, and gave a very rushed tasting. By the time we were halfway through tasting and discussing one wine, she would already be pouring the next one. At the same time, I was shocked by her knowledge. She had no good advice for our upcoming visit to Mendoza (the wine touring capital of Argentina), and actually got some wine facts wrong! (She said that Chile doesn't grow Malbec, which isn't true, see wikipedia for example.) After the rushed drinking portion, almost half of the tasting was centered around trying to sell their wine club and their wine. I'd expect that at a free tasting, but not at a supposedly elegant tasting that I paid good money to attend.Finally, for $40 a person, you can buy a lot of great wine in Buenos Aires. I added up the price of the wines we tasted, and for the $80 that my wife and I spent, we could have just bought one of all of the bottles that we tasted (at Anuva's prices!) Never mind that with $80 we could have an incredible steak dinner and a superb bottle of wine and still have money left over.I'm baffled as to why Anuva is ranked so high, and would suggest that visitors to Buenos Aires skip this tasting and put their time and money towards better activities."

Sarah did a fantastic job hosting the event, describing what we could expect from the wines and giving us some background on the wine terroir. We started with a sparkling wine just to get us in the mood and then followed by a white Torrantes and then 4 reds. The wines were accompanied by a tasting platter with the individual food elements matched to the wines to bring out the taste. The sorbets were seriously to die for.Starting at 18:00 allows you to fit this into your itinerary and go for dinner afterwards. There is no hard sell, Sarah just hands out a price list if you are interested in getting hold of more wine. She also provides hints and tips for restaurants in BA and trips within the region. We used her recommendation to go to Sarkis and had an excellent meal.Really enjoyed it and would recommend it - very accessible and enjoyable part of your trip if you don't have time to get to Mendoza."

The wine tasting was rushed and conversation seemed controlled by the host. The food was average at best and the empenadas were cold. To top it off, upon leaving our host tried to upsell us 12 bottles of wine to be shipped from the US, where they bottle and distribute all of their \"Argentinian\" wines. If you want a more authentic argentinian wine experience, go to the super market, buy 4 bottles of wine with your friends, some cheese and bread and go for it...it will definitely be cheaper too."

He knew each wine very well and even seemed to have personal relationships with many of the wineries. He answered my basic questions openly and clearly.I must admit that when it comes to wine I am still a novice. Many of the subtle scents and tastes in wine generally escape me. For what its worth, the wine we sampled was good. A sparkling white followed by four progressively \"fuller\" reds (mostly Malbec) were all delightful. The wine was poured liberally and refills were encouraged. Each was paired with a different food. We ended the night with Daniel's personal dinner recommendations (VERY HELPFUL). Our experience at this wine tasting really helped set the tone for the rest of our trip. We really enjoyed many of the recommended restaurants, confidently ordering Malbec at each."

As an added bonus, the tasting included a food paired to each wine. The careful thought that went into choosing the wine and foods were evident in the fact the the pairings were perhaps the best we have ever had. Sarah, the tasting room director, was extremely knowledgeable about the wines and was very friendly. We had both experienced and novice wine drinkers in our group and she did a great job of making sure everyone could enjoy the tasting. We were the first group to have a tasting in their new location at the Rendezvouz hotel in Palermo and it was gorgeous. The space is intimate and comfortable and the decor is beautiful.

Food and sorbet were excellent. Most importantly- one gets an expatriates view on where to go ( dinner, art entertainment) what to do, where not to go, how to tip etc. in a relaxed atmosphere. One also gets a glimpse of apartment life in BA. My wife even developed a taste for something different. Even better it is a gift that keeps on giving, since you can continue to order wines not available in the states"

We, along with 2 other couples tried 5 wines, a sparkling, a white and 3 different reds paired with food such as chocolate, empanadas or sorbet. As we tried each wine we were given a description of the wine, flavors and location of the grapes. They also have a wine club if you would like to sign up at the end. A good choice if you are in BA and enjoy wine."

It was fun to hear everyones opinion on each of the wines as we tried them. We were probably there for about an hour and a half. We tried 5 wines from Mendoza, Argentina. Each wine was paired with what I would call a tapas offering selected to compliment the wine. We enjoy wine alot so we thought this was big fun and well worth the 40 US dollars each that it cost. Our hostess Sarah, did a great job educating us about Argentine wines and also telling us lots of helpful hints about BA."

Due to disastrous weather our group was over 1 hour late to the Anuva Wine Tasting hosted in their lovely Las Canitas apartment. Despite our tardy arrival, the Anuva staff patiently waited for us to and even speeded up the process by sending us a personalized car service that they use. The staff couldn't have been more professional, fun or kind. The wines were a great variety of Argentine wines from a sparking white to a traditional Malbec. All which were paired nicely with little tapas that enhanced their flavors. It was an intimate night and we learned a lot about Argentine wines as well as their wine club that delivers from Buenos Aires to 34 states in America. I recommend it for tourists interested in learning more about Argentine Wines and shipping wines to America from Buenos Aires."

Our hostess was very informative about not only the wines, but also other activities in Buenos Aires, restaurants, etc. I was impressed with the presentation of the wine and the food it was paired with. The wines were excellent and we were served a variety of different types, including a sparkling wine and Malbecs. The food was delicious. I was pleased to find out that Anuva ships their wine to my house in the U.S. Overall, this wine tasting was a very pleasant experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something fun and relaxing to do."

The wine and food pairings were to die for. We actually purchased 24 bottles of wine that will be shipped to us in New York. We also loved our hostess; she's a class act.Not to be missed!"

The host Sarah is a charming vinophile who passionately educates the group on the amazing wine selections she pours. Our group sampled 3 reds, one white, and a sparkling white. Each pour was well paired to a food sampling that helped bring out the flavor of the wine. What I liked most about the experience was the coziness of it all. It was like being invited over to a friends house for an evening of wine and good conversation. And we were all strangers! Also, Sarah will arrange for you to have any of the wines you liked shipped to you in the United States. I would highly recommend that you include Anuva Wines in your Buenos Aires itinerary."

It was informative for my novice standards and very laid back, so questions could be answered. I do, however, think the tasting was overpriced at USD $40 (not incl. taxi fare to/from the tasting site). I was expecting more food choices or snacks for that amount, or some kind of small gift (bottle opener with Anuva logo or something)."

It is a wine tasting that is set in an apartment, which makes it very cozy. It is very nice and the hosts Sarah and Daniel were great and very friendly. The wines were from smaller wineries throughout Argentina and were delicious. They paired them with some light tapas which were really good and really complimented the wines beautifully. You do not need to be a \"wine snob\" to have a great time here. They can ship Argentinian wines to some US states via their wine club, which makes it easy to get fantastic wine from smaller wineries. I would go back to Anuva anytime I was in Argentina!"

There were small local food samples to accompany the wine which were excellent and they also provided an alternative vegetarian plate for one person in our group.

The atmosphere was warm and engaging, not a typical \"lecture\" environment. They listened and learned about my preferences and made excellent recommendations, not just for wine, but for restaurants, tours, cafes, and more. Best of all, the wine was FANTASTIC! Their wine club is such a great deal. Can't wait till I start receiving some of these great Argentine wines back in the states!"

We relied heavily on tripadvisor in deciding where to go and what to do. Since people eat dinner late in BA, we had to come up with something to pass time in the early evenings. We like wine and decided to give the Anuva Wines tasting a shot.We both really enjoyed it. The wines were delicious, the pairings were thoughtful, and our hosts couldn't have been more gracious. We got to taste things that we might not have otherwise come across, from small producers. As Americans in BA, it was nice to spend a little time speaking English with other Americans (Dan the owner is from the States, as is Sarah his colleague) and they gave us great tips on which restaurants to try, which to skip, and how best to use our time. We also asked Dan about mat\u00e9, the Argentine beverage we had wanted to try, and he promptly heated some water, filled a gourd with yerba, and introduced us properly to the mat\u00e9 ritual. That was a great bonus.If I had to come up with any criticism, I would say that the price seems a little steep for BA. Maybe in the future the price will come down or Anuva will offer to apply the tasting fee to a purchase. But it was a fun experience, and we're glad we went. I'd suggest doing this early in your trip if you want to take advantage of Dan's knowledge of the city and recommendations. Now that we're back in the States, we are thinking of ways to use his online store to send gifts to friends."

I was one of three participants in the wine tasting, so we had plenty of opportunities to ask questions, discuss wines and other topics, and absorb authentic Argentine hospitality. If you like or want to try a small, intimate setting for a wine tasting, give Anuva a try. The instruction in Argentine wine is worthwhile, but I think it has the most value for those who want to have a dialog about it. The entire event is akin to having wine with friends, but where the subject matter IS wine. A great time."

My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hours dedicated solely to ourselves in his apartment. There were 5 wine tastings accompanied by tapas, carefully paired and beautifully presented. We kicked off with a cava, a white torrontes and three reds, the last of which was a reserve. Throughout the tastings we learnt about each of the wines and wine-tasting in general. They were so divine we had 6 bottles sent to our hotel the following day! Even if you are only in BA for a few days, this is an evening not to be missed."

Next time I visit Buenos Aires will check if Anuva has some new exquisit Argentinian wines."

There are also 5-6 wine glasses in front of every setting! Every wine we tasted was very good, from the sparkler to the big chewy malbec, all were awesome! Dan is knowledgeable in regards to the wines, the city and it's people and I would suggest doing this early on in your trip. Not only will you get some local knowledge, but you can also purchase the wines that you taste for extremely reasonable prices so that you can have them to drink over the rest of your stay. Additonally, you can have Dan ship any wines that you like back to the US!"

I enjoyed the presentation during the wine tasting I attended because Daniel catered to both the experienced wine drinkers in the crowd and the newbies, such as myself.If a wine term comes up that I wouldn't know, I never needed to ask. I learned a lot about the wine regions of Argentina, what makes them particularly unique (hint: the Andes Mountains), and also drank a nice variety of wines from an Argentinean sparkling white to the Malbec I've heard so much about. I have joined their wine club and am happy to be able to take a little piece of Argentina home with me."

And oh, the wines! Great Malbecs and some interesting stuff too that I had never heard of. My friends were very happy that Anuva ships to the U.S. as well for very cheap. Apparently they are the only place that does."
