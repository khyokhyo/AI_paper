The bridge is Ho Hum but the Walk from Manly to the Spit Bridge or the reverse is world class.Get a guide leaflet an do the walk early morning or late afternoon and enjoy Sydney at its best.If you get a ferry to Manly ,turn left and keep walking.,About 10 klms in all.At the Spit bridge you can get a bus or taxi back to Manly or a bus back to the city."

The Spit Bridge, connecting the Sydney North Shore suburbs of Mosman and Seaforth, has played a vital part in the development of Sydney from Seaforth right up to Palm Beach, 40 km to the north. Without the Spit Bridge, access to these northern beach side suburbs would have been via other harbour crossings, involving much longer and more complicated routes.At the beginning of the 20th Century, the only crossing was by punt, a slow and frustrating procedure for those in a hurry.In 1924 the first Spit Bridge was built, a low-level timber bridge.This was replaced in 1958 with the current bridge, a steel and concrete girder bridge, with a bascule lift span to allow yachts and other boats passage across Middle Harbour, which is part of Sydney Harbour.The Spit Bridge is also either the start of finish, depending which way you walk, of the famous Manly to Spit Harbour-side walk."

From sandy beaches, rugged cliffs, thick forest that could have been a million miles from anywhere to beautiful suburban homes this walk had everything.

Actually we were wondering the difficulty of this walk. It was mentioned with gentle - medium but we think it it rather medium. If you want to do the whole turn you need to be quiet fit as there are a lot of stairs/steps. It was a very nice walk with almost no people which was surprising. We fully recommend this walk. It was beautiful and a highlight so far. The Bondi to Coogee instead was also nice as well but very crowded."

            "review": "A beautiful walk with great views. This is an excellent alternative to Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk. Perhaps a little longer but more varied as it passes through green vegetation as well as beaches with many great picnic spots along the way. The view of the harbour and over to Manly are breathtaking. Highly recommended even in not so good weather. Take a bus from Wynyard that goes via the Spit Bridge; ask the driver where to get off. The beginning of the track is reasonably easy to find, just under the bridge on the north-east side. Once on the walking path it is pretty straightforward although you have options to take side paths to mini beaches or view points. Along the way you will see lizards that might come quite close if you happen to sit down and eat an apple! In spring time you can see many wild flowers. There is one beach that you will have to cross continuing in the normal direction. If there is high tide you might need to take off your shoes as the strip of sand between houses and the bay is narrow. Once you are near Manly you again have to watch a little where you are going but the signposting has improved over the years and there are usually others you can ask for direction. Once in Manly, you may wish to visit the famous ocean beach before taking a ferry back to downtown and the Opera House. A great day / half day program!"

We caught a train to the city, a bus to The Spit, did the walk to Manly and then caught the ferry back to Circular Quay and train home.We went in the cooler months which was very pleasant but I believe those that do it in the warmer months, take extra time to jump in for a swim at different beaches along the way, to cool off.Whichever time of the year you do this walk, you won't be disappointed."

Scenery to die for with new views around every corner and a good work out for an afternoon. Track was narrow in places so needed to be aware of other walkers and we missed the turn off to the lighthouse ( next time) . Plenty of up and down so those who are after the exercise this is great.

Parking is better and getting back there is easier too. It's an easy walk, for keen walkers of all ages. The views are just amazing. My favourite bit is around the Grotto Point Make sure you don't miss the aboriginal engravings when there. There are no toilets and no food to buy on the walk. So , either stock up in the Clontarf cafes or in Manly. ALso, I don't think there are any water fountains, so make sure you have sufficient amount of water with you. The walk is partly shaded but still make sure you have a hat, camera and some snacks.Let the views, the ocean and the bay do the rest. It's so rewarding and recharging you will feel miles away."

The 10 km walk is a great experience for my son who basically loves the amazing sights , beaches & coastal walk. Passing along the beautiful ,idyllic places, sacred to the Aboriginals before the development took place. Seeing the water dragon lizard up close & personal, wildlife plants and the serenity and stillness of the place once you reached the top of the hill is unimaginable. Walking along the coastline is a magical experience especially for a 11 year young boy. Although , there are some spot that you lose signal from your mobile but not for long. I'll strongly recommend to pack some food & snacks, bring a lot water. Autumn is a good season to do the walk. The highlights of the walk is you get to jump in any local beaches after the walk before you head home. Buses are frequent that travel to the city after the walk of you can head back to Manly beach and take ferry going back to the Circular Quay."

But if you are up for the challenge then it will be worth starting from Balmoral Beach.It takes about 3hrs 30min, so make sure you have a snack handy, as there are no cafes or shops until you reach Manly.Keep an eye on the water as you might be treated to the whales or the penguins."

There are toilets close to the Manly portion of the walk, yet you are very isolated for much of it, especially from Clontarf reserve to forty baskets beach.

I stared from Spit Bridge and walked till manly. If you are going from City, you can take bus # 178 which takes approx 25 mints to reach The spit. I travelled on Sunday, so frequency of the bus was once in an hour.The walk is somewhere between Easy to medium (there are few steps) at some places. I could spot some elderly people as well as people with toddlers on the way. But you cannot take strollers on this walk.It takes approximately 3 hours if you halt occasionally for couple of minutes as it's 10 kms long stretch- perfect for a day outing.

We started by crossing Spit Bridge (there are many buses which stop just before the bridge) and picking up the clearly marked coastal path. The 10km walk winds around picturesque headlands and through harbour side bush and past plenty of secluded beaches (perfect for a swim on a hot day!). There are also marked places of Aboriginal importance, so make sure you check out some amazing rock carvings, and take a look at the view out to sea while you are there. Some of the lookouts face back towards the city and others provide a beautifully clear view out to North and South Head and the sea. There are a few places scattered along the walk that would make good lunch stops, or it is possible to do the walk and make it to Manly in time for lunch (as we did). Some of the track is quite exposed and there is not always a lot of shade so definitely take a hat, sunscreen and plenty of water, as well as sturdy shoes as there are some steep inclines and steps. This is a great way to spend half a day (or stretch it out for a full day). There is plenty to do at Manly and the ferry is the easiest (and most enjoyable) way to get back to Circular Quay. This is a great way to see some iconic places in Sydney and to get outside for the day."

So we took the steps going down towards the beach and started proceeding climbing boulders until such time that it became difficult making us to retreat and take the steps going uphill. We lost about 20 minutes in this little confusion. Towards the end when we reached the sandy beach again we didn't see any pointers to spit bridge. Other than these two drawbacks it was a lovely walk which we took about 4 hours to complete. My 6 yr old son and 60 yr old father could complete this walk with little difficulty.

The route is well shaded so you aren't in constant sunshine but it is hot so make sure you take some water with you. There is one point along the way where you can fill up your water bottle if needed.We took the bus from Sydney which is really convenient and then returned on the Manly ferry. Fantastic views and plenty to see. Wear shoes or trainers appropriate for walking because even on a dry days there are wet patches. The ferry back is the perfect way to round off the walk, which takes approx 3 hours at a leisurely pace."

Personally i will recommend coogee to bondi beach, the sea view are breath taking. How to get here: take bus from wynyard train station, stand C at Carrington street, a lot of bus from there, 178, 179 and 180 (more bus i supposed ). Stop before the bridge, and walk under it to the other side of the bridge and walk across the bridge. The walk start here.The route can be pretty heavy at certain point, but mostly are fine, look for the sign MSW (manly scenic walk) for the direction. When you arrived at manly, do not forget to go to 4 pines micro brewery, it's great bar (separate review )."

You could probably do it in a couple of hours if your really got a march on but don't, take your time and soak it in. Allow 3-4 hours or more if you want to make a day of it.

We took bus to the Spit Bridge and after the walk - ferry from Manly to Sydney Harbor.It is a 10km walk that took us approximately 3.5 hours to complete with many stops for picture taking and stop for a swim on one of the smaller rocky beaches along the way. It was very hot. There are some places that are completely open with no shade; we burnt badly (especially ears and necks) even with sunscreen, because it was hot and sweaty. The worst combinations for me were steps up in completely open spaces on hot sun. There is also detour in the end of the walk.The walk offers spectacular views of the entrance to the harbor and over to the city, Downtown. Loved the Doggie Beach, our dogs would love it. I would do this walk again in some other season, not summer. The walk is beautiful, definitely would recommend it.The views from Manly Ferry were beautiful as well."

It had rained heavily the night before so the path was very wet and muddy in places, definitely wear very good walking shoes. We stopped in the park at Clontarf to eat lunch (there is a kiosk there as well as toilets and a place to fill a water bottle) Not sure how this took some previous reviewers less than 2 hours, it took us 5, we were taking it easy but I don't think it would have been possible for us to do it in less than 3 hours unless we did not stop at all. This was strenuous in places if you are not fit, a bit of climbing up and down. They were in the process of installing steps closer to the Manly end when we were there, I'm sure this will help with the muddiness on the trail. If you enjoy walking this is a must do!"

You can do it in joggers, thongs and carry your water and phone if you want but why make life more difficult for yourself.Enjoy!

I have been meaning to do The Spit Bridge to Manly Walk for ages and finally managed to do it.Approximately 10km long, it takes around 3 hours to walk it in one direction depending on where you start and how many stops you take.We went on a Sunday and it was pretty hot - about 29 degrees; however there was a nice sea breeze which kept us cool.There were quite a few walkers doing this route in both directions and there are quite a few shady spots which keeps you out of the sun. However make sure you bring sun lotion and plenty of water/food/snacks with you. There are some water fountains along the way and toilets if required though.You also pass a few beaches along the way which is perfect for cooling down in; however as it had been stormy the last few days we didn't go in the water as it says you should not swim due to the pollution. However we did have to take our shoes off near the start as you have to walk in the water along the beach for a bit so make sure you bring a towel to wipe off your feet!As you are following the coast there are many opportunities for fantastic views and you can see the city at some points as well as the Heads. There are some steps up and down so this is not good for prams or wheelchairs. Make sure you have good footwear too. Part of our paths were quite muddy and slippery due to the rain from the days before so be careful.When you get to Manly you can either get a ferry back to the city or a bus back which we did. You can start at either location but I think the way we went was less hilly (don't quote me on that though!).Overall a fantastic walk which you can do quickly or leisurely with lots of stops.

You can get a taxi from manly and then walk back to manly. Or leave your car at spit bridge and then taxi back (it's about $15 max). The walk goes around the headland of the coast, with amazing views of Sydney, aboriginal rock drawings, little creatures and lots more. Stop off for a swim along the way, and don't forget water & sunscreen. There is only one cafe and water spot at the start (from spit bridge) otherwise you're on your own. Enjoy."

Take lunch and swimmers with you as there are several spots where you can have a dip. The track is not hard but there are a few spots to be carefull. Keep a lookout for aboriginal rock art and see if you can find the hidden path to Crater Cove in the photo where early huts have been preserved."

Quite a change from here in the states! A very long but beautiful walk with some amazing scenery. The walk was nice and quiet as I did not see too many other walkers. The trip does bring you up and down some hills so you certainly want to be in decent shape. The view were spectacular and you get to see a variety of Australia wildlife and vegetation. They even have an area where you can see Aboriginal carvings in the rocks. Made it to Manly and walked around town and walked the beach where I stumbled upon the Shelly Headland Upper Lookout where I watched a beautiful sunset. After a quick bite in town I took the ferry back to Circular Quay. Highly recommend this long trek. Can't beat free views!"

Having spent most of my Sydney life in the east or inner west I was coaxed into crossing over the bridge to do the Spit Bridge to Manly Walk. Let's get one thing straight we started in Manly and made our way to the Spit Bridge. Along the way it was a mix of walking along the beach or in the national park. The track is well maintained but I would suggest wearing good walking shoes although some people were wearing thongs/flip flops. The signage along the way explaining various things was also helpful. It was great to see Sydney Harbour from the other side of the bridge. I wasn't disappointed and will definitely return if I have interstate or overseas visitors to show them a different perspective of Sydney."

There are bathrooms there, at Clontarf beach 30 mins in and some more about 30 minutes before manly. Take your own water - there are a couple of places to fill up but these are easy to miss - just pulled sticking up out of the ground - called bubblers. Wear shoes with good tread - there are some slippy areas especially when you start the descent into Manly. Be careful at 40 baskets beach, if the tide is in you have to take a marked detour. Parts of the trail are still a bit muddy after the recent rain, so be prepared to get a bit muddy. Not always well signposted, we had to ask for directions at Clontarf beach after we lost the trail. Lizards were cool! The whole walk took us about 3 hours, ending in Manly with a well deserved lunch at the Bavarian cafe on the ferry wharf before catching the ferry back to circular quay."

Last weekend we embarked on it for the 3rd time. Caught a bus from Central station to the Spit and began the walk. Were fortunate enough to see the Spit Bridge open so that was a great start. The begining of the walk is probably the hardest. More bush tracks and more ups and downs. By the time you get to near Manly, it is pathways which is a great way to end it off. The views along the way are magnificent and the sea breezes keep you cool. Plenty of places to stop for rests on the way or a splash in the ocean but no shops really to purchase drinks or food. It is a 3 hour walk so wear comfy shoes but it is a doable walk for people of all fitness levels; simply go at your own pace. We have done it with young Primary age children, with teens and this time, just my husband and I. Once you arrive at Manly, you can then reward yourself with a delicious fish and chip meal. You could even end the walk off with a visit to the Aqarium which is really worthwhile. We love this walk and if we lived closer, would do it many more times but we live an hour and half drive away. However, we reckon it is worth the drive to see those amazing views."

The walk is not easy, lots of stairs meandering up and down but the views along the way are worth it all, it's so pretty you marvel you are in a capital city at all. The walk crosses local beaches and in places you must walk the sand and risk getting wet feet ( all part of the fun) there is shade a lot of the way, but as you come up over the headland and start getting those wonderful views out to North and South Head and Manly too you are quite exposed to sun and wind, hats necessary, some wonderful Indigenous Rock Art also on the headland , don't miss the slight detour to take that in."

The Spit to Manly walk takes about 4-5 hours to cover the 10 kms of walk through a multitude of beaches, vantage points, hillsides. It starts from the Spit bridge (if you are travelling by bus, get down immediately after the Spit bridge and look out for signage indicating the start of the walk) and ends at the Manly wharf. A few pointers:1.) Carry a water bottle (and some snacks) as it is a long walk 2.) Carry a camera is possible as you will get some amazing views on the way3.) Food and water is available at select places only (Clontarf Reserve at the start of the walk has an eatery - you can grab a bite here if needed)4.) Look out for side roads moving away from the main route - these are very rewarding with fantastic views of the seas, cliffs and even the cityscapes. There are a few aboriginal carvings as well at a location. So take your time and allot at least half a day to savor the most from this walk5.) You will find a few good beaches as well, including a few reef spots for snorkelling - carry your gear in case you feel it interesting6.) There are markers / signs all along the way with maps of the vantage points / points of interest - do check them to ensure you know which ones to pick (check image)Lastly, once you reach Manly, there are multiple restaurants to help you with a well deseved meal to regain a few of the calories lost"

            "review": "Great walk. We walked from Manly to Spit Bridge and then got the bus back. We picked up a map from the visitor centre in Manly which was useful at a couple of points so we could be sure we'd gone the right way. The walk was largely sign-posted clearly, the only issue we had with directions was that almost at the end when you get to the beach, there's just a vague indication that you have to walk the length of the beach, but we couldn't as the sea was all the way in at one point. Thankfully we could navigate our way to the far end on the side-roads behind the beach.Also, there was meant to be a coffee shop about two-thirds of the way along, but we didn't even notice a sign for it. Then not long before the end of the walk at the beach there is a shop and cafe you can't miss.There are a couple of stopping points with water taps/fountains and toilets directly off the walk, it wasn't too hot the day we were there and we found a litre of water each was enough between refills. Probably worth having more than that and taking snacks if you think you're not going to walk very fast.The walk took around 4hrs, with us walking at a fairly quick pace but stopping for photos / drinks / suntan-lotion application now and then. A lot of the walk is quite shady, but you do definitely need hat / sunglasses / suntan-lotion. There are a lot of steps, both up and down, as you go along the coast popping down to the shore one moment then back up along a cliff edge the next. The difficulty is probably a medium level, most people could manage it but some might need to go slower. There were people jogging/running some sections though!The views are great and the whole walk is very scenic. Highly recommended."

The views are, as always, spectacular, and the trail is perfect for people of all fitness types. You can turn it into a gorgeous run, or take a slow stroll and enjoy the scenery. Either way, you can't beat the beauty of nature! The walk will definitely take a long chunk of time - but that depends on how quickly you walk!"

            "review": "One of my favourite walks - a nice longer walk than the usual tourist routes. I love this walk and regularly take the trip over to do it (we're in training for a 100km hike). I think it is better to start at Spit Bridge and walk to Manly as opposed to the other way around as transport links from Manly are better, plus its a nicer place to finish up (there's not much at Spit Bridge - there is a nice Italian restaurant though with some delicious gnocchi).The start of the walk is tricky to find so follow these simple steps:  If taking the bus from the city, alight at bus stop and cross to the opposite side of the road (use the pedestrian crossing just behind you). Now continue the direction the bus was going and walk across the bridge. On your right hand side once you have crossed the bridge you will see an unnamed road (car accessible), walk down here and you will see the signposts for the beginning of the walk. The walk itself has some steep climbs, steps and mixed terrain (beach, bush etc.) so I wouldn't take my grandmother. I would say anyone of any fitness level could do the walk, but you might need to take it slower. I am a quick, energetic walker, many a time I have more then a bead of sweat at the top of one of the hills, especially in hot weather.Take suncream! There are some water fountains en-route, so refilling isn't too much of an issue. The time it takes to complete the walk really varies on fitness level, photo taking etc. When I've taken guests, it has taken up to 4-hours, when I went solo it took 2-hours, 8-minutes the last time (to be precise).The views are amazing, the animals (lizards and birds) en-route are awesome, and it is just truly a fantastic walk! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others!"

Gorgeous scenery, lots of wild life, and a bit of history in between. Would recommend to pack a rucksack with some water and perhaps food. And if you fancy a swim, bring your bathing suits and towels. There are some beached on the way where you can cool down with a swim.Arriving in Manley, you can find a local bar to enjoy a cold beverage, or find a place to get a cooling ice cream. Would definitely do this walk again"

Trek along the shore of inland tributary towards Sydney Harbour and along towards Manly. There are bushy, woodsy areas, wooden tracks, stones to fossick, beaches to stroll, and some of the finest vistas around Sydney. I highly recommend the trek for the natural experience alone... yet when reaching Manly, we often enjoy a cafe meal, drink, then board the Ferry back to the City. What better? Top off the day with a harbour cruise (on one of the many ferries) for just a few dollars -- enjoy!"

If you are scared of water dragons, first 2 km may be difficult but after that is all paradise. A few cafes on the way. Carry a change if you plan to take a dip in the beautiful water on the way.

We exited at Grotto Point, and to our astonishment, found a free bus at the exit point to take us to Ballgowlah shopping centre and another back to Manly ferry. Before you leave the ferry terminal, go to the information centre there and pick up a free brochure listing the buses and their routes. It's worthwhile having the buses as back up in case you hit a bad day as we did. The bus drivers are very helpful. At Grotto point the buses seem to come at a quarter to the hour, and not sure of other times. We will take the bus there the next time to finish the walk. We caught the ferry from Circular Quay, returning later in the day on the same ferry. Nice cafes at Manly for lunch or coffee and cake."

First, make sure it is a nice day, not too hot or humid and definitely not when its raining. And carry water, even in the cooler months. Spring is perfect - when the wattles and wildflowers are in full bloom and the track is a blaze of colour. And the views over the bush and the harbour, back to the city and across Manly Cove are stupendous. If for some rare reason the person doesn't enjoy the experience, you can reassure yourself that you have tried your best and they are just not the bushwalking type.The track is about 10 km long and takes about two and a half hours to walk. Most of the track is well made, though there are a couple of steep bits and it does get muddy and in places slippery after rain. Get to either end of the track by public transport - bus from Wynyard Station to the Spit or ferry to Manly. The kiosk at Clontarf Park is only about half an hour from the Spit and is an excellent place to stop for a coffee. In fact, it is the only such stop along the route."

            "review": "One of Our Most Memorable Hikes!!. On a gorgeous day in early September, we walked a block from our hotel in Sydney's CBD and caught the bus which stops on the far side of The Spit bridge across Fisher Bay. Since it was Sunday, we had purchased \"Sunday-Funday\" tickets for AUD2.50 each, which allowed us to travel by metro, bus and ferry, all day long, a super bargain.Alighting at The Spit, we took the trail which goes under the bridge and heads around Fisher Bay, then on to Sandy Bay Road to Clontarf Beach. On a Sunday morning, this lovely area was chock full of families, kids everywhere, barbies roaring, dogs splashing in the bay, fun everywhere. The walk continues along the shore and headlands of the Middle Harbor, then moves inland as the trail turns to the northeast. There is a lot of up-and-down walking, many sets of stairs, some boardwalks, but mostly just track. The way is mostly smooth walking. And it is absolutely spectacular! From each high point, a lovely vista opens up -- marinas, gorgeous clear water trending from turquoise to deep blue, a few whitecaps showing, sailboats underway, ferries passing. And then the view from the next headland is even more stunning. On a Sunday you will encounter hundreds of hikers, going in both directions, but the trail and the topography easily absorb all comers. From Crater Cove around Dobroyd Head to Reef Beach and on past the residences of Forth Baskets Beach and around the North Harbor, the trail takes you from one breathtaking site to the next. It's a ten km hike from The Spit bridge, and one you will remember.Once you arrive in Manly, the crowds really take over on a Sunday morning. There are folks everywhere, milling about, filling all the cafes and shops, ambling along the Corso over to the Pacific side, then filling the beach over there as well. So just be ready to \"go with the flow\" until you find a nice spot to stop, have a beer or eat lunch.We chose the Hotel Steyne's spacious restaurant, grabbed a table overlooking the action on the beach and had some excellent fish 'n chips, with a very nice local lager to wash it all down.Then off to the ferry back to Circular Quay, where we immediately hopped (for free) onto another ferry out to Watson's Bay and back for a different perspective on this magnificent harbor."

At that time it is cooler and you avoid most of the earnest latex clad runners pushing past. It is a most scenic, interesting, varied path, and quite challenging as it is 9.5 km each way and rises up to 200ft above sea level before descending again to the beaches. There is an interesting midden made from shells discarded by aborigines years ago, and many birds and usually large lizards to be seen up close. We used to breakfast near the wharf in Manly and walk back again, enjoying its unspoiled natural state clambering over rocks and by-passing rain puddles. However , some five years or so ago the authorities started \u201c improvements\u201d (Schlimmbesserung) by bringing in great sacks of gravel (by helicopter I'm told) to widen and line paths, handrails have been added and I believe steps installed in some places. We don\u2019t go there anymore. These works may help some less fit people and others but spoil the experience for many more. I accept that, at my age, I cannot climb Mt Everest now but I don\u2019t want a lift installed for people who can\u2019t do it."

The view along the way is just gorgeous. Walking with the sea on one side and views of Manly on the other is a relaxing way to spend a day. This is a popular walk and the path does get busy at times. Lots of places to stop and sit of just take a photo.

We go early to avoid the hordes (which is getting harder to do these days) and stretches through the National Park have been vastly improved over the years. My husband starts in North Sydney, and I drive to Manly. We cross over somewhere near the oval so husband continues to Manly while I actually exit at Balgowlah Heights to get a coffee at the fab deli at the top of the hill, and wait to be picked up. The beauty of the walk is the different \"worlds\" you go through - by the harbour with all the locals exercising their dogs, a few suburban streets, the Harbourside parks, the bush of the national park, and of course the stunning views of the Heads. Whichever variation of the walk, it is a winner, and of course the benefit of doing whole Spit to Manly is that you can have brekkie at one of Manlys terrific cafes."

Some parts are quite closed over so although still enjoyable you don't get vews 100% of the way around.

It's up and down so don't think it's an easy stroll but then of course it's also not like walking in the Dolomites where uphill really does mean uphill! Take a snack as there are numerous places to stop and sit and look at one of the most beautiful harbours in the world. And take water especially if it is hot.You could do the walk in standard running shoes or sneakers. If you end up in Manly then you're spoilt for choice in terms of cafes and restaurants. However, if you finish at the Spit Bridge then there are really only expensive restaurants to choose from. If you park your car at The Spit Bridge (time limits apply so be careful of parking fines) you can catch a bus back from Manly to The Spit Bridge. Great day out! Or half a day if you walk quickly."

Four of us did it on a warmish, Autumn Sunday (It would be a killer in full summer sun). It's a solid 12 km walk. There are quite a lot of steps in some places, but the views are well worth it. Standing directly in from of the Sydney Heads was a one of many great sights. Also very worthwhile were the indigenous rock engravings. These will be eroded sooner rather than later and are a real treasure that need to be visited asap. Other reviewers describe the walk as 'long' and suggest one has to be fairly fit. That's probably true of urban dwellers who don't walk regularly, but for those who walk often, this is a walk not a hike. However, while regular walking shoes are adequate there can be a bit of wet, even muddy dirt in places. Allow three hours plus in order to take in all the sites. Return to Manly by bus or, alternatively, take the bus to Spit Bridge and walk back.Tip: Take food and take plenty of water.Note: This is not a walk for people with limited mobility."

It is long and quite tiring and can be hot so bring hat etc plus water. This section takes you to the tops of the escarpment which gives the most outstanding views. These views are easily accessible by car and frankly that is OK unless you are a very keen walker because to get there on foot involves a fair bit of not so great walk through the scrub.For me the highlight of the walk is from the start of the beaches once the track meanders down on the northern section all the way to Manly. This part takes you through lots of small pretty secluded beaches (one is, or was, nudist) past boatsheds across a park and then a couple of kilometres of well made path only metres from the water to Manly. Outstandingly beautiful and it takes you past what is now Fairlight where Captain Phillip, the first Governor of Australia in 1788, met with the original inhabitants and was so impressed that he called the area Manly. This is now a tourist trap but still very worth the visit because of it's amazing location, beaches and other wonderful walks."

She had bussed from Manly to The Spit Bridge and then walked back, but she said you could do it the other way, walk first and bus back. 10km she said, and a delight. Don't forget to take the time to enjoy the views along the way.So. I got some basic info from the a manly info centre near the Manly Wharf set off the next morning. Comfy sneakers or walking shoes, and hat, litre of water and a snack are well worth taking. It took me more than two and a half hours but I'm a fair walker. I did most little detours and one big one, and stopped to enjoy to view regularly. you don't have to be super fit but there are a lot of ups and ups and ups, and downs and downs, and lots of steps... It's not for the faint hearted.But I thoroughly enjoyed it. Once there ( at spit bridge) I crossed the bridge and had lunch at a ldelightfull little cafe called The Plank (or was it The Plonk) while I contemplated whether to bus back or walk.Unless you're super keen I'd do one way only. I did both and loved it, but I had no time pressure and I had all day. The walk back with less stops and detours was less than Two and a half hours but I was tired by the time I got back.Basically you just keep as close to the waters edge as you can. There are MSW signs (Manly Scenic Walk) and Google maps will help keep your bearings.I passed plenty of fellow walkers, none made me feel uncomfortable ... but it does get quite out of the way of everything so you may prefer to walk with a friend.There are quite a few toilet stops along the way if you look for them, but don't rely on shops or cafe's.The walk is a treat in either direction so choose what works for you."

Better still do both, they are totally different and a lovely way to get out of the city.For this walk, take the Manly ferry from Circular Quay to Manly, then stop off at the tourist information office as you disembark, the very helpful staff there will give you a map and details of how to pick up a bus back to the city when you finish. Grab some water, your camera, sun lotion if it's hot and a snack and head out.The views as you leave Manly and start to hug the coast are delightful, very quickly you are off the beaten track and wondering is you've wandered into paradise. The coves are tiny and for the most part you will be completely alone. The walk takes you along the coastline and through a number of nature reserves, the biggest of which is part of the Sydney Harbour National Park and includes Dobroyd Head. You climb quite steeply through native scrubland, but it's well worth the views from the top.The walk took me about 3 hours. I am a regular walker and am used to hills, although I did stop to take lots of pictures, so it may take others a little longer. I had a beautiful winters day but I can imagine in the summer it might be quite hot!One word of warning, there are a lot of steps, well maintained on the whole but they could be slippery in wet weather.When you finish, walk to the other side of Spit Bridge and pick up a 179 bus which will take you back to the city in about 30mins."

As regular runners we thought 10k would be a breeze but we forgot to take into account the Australian climate (even in Winter) and the rugged terrain.Main tips? Sensible, comfy shoes and plenty of water and snacks.Although this is technically a coastal walk, you don't actually get to see all that much in the way of coast as most of the walk is along a tree-lined forest path. Where there are viewpoints however, the sea views are truly breathtaking - definitely worth taking a decent camera if you've got a comfortable camera bag.By the time we got to the 8k point we were stopping every 400m or so to have a little rest (there are plenty of benches) and we were very relieved when the harbour came into view at around the 9k mark. It was also at this point that we got to a beach where (at the right times of the year) you can see the native \"Little Penguins\" basking in the sun. They are currently mating and nesting though so we had to make do with the far less cute seagulls.When we finally reached Manly Harbour (about 4.5 hours after we set off from the Spit bridge) we were spoilt for choice in terms of places to rest our weary legs and fill our hungry bellies. We opted for Hugo's on the main wharf (reviewed separately) and we really enjoyed it! Once refreshed, we popped over to the beach (definitely worth a visit) and then hopped on the ferry back to Circular Quay.All in all, a very pleasant walk for those who like a good hike and are prepared to work for their views."

A very scenic walk with some steep spots but generally not hard work The views from most of the walk are sensational with the top of the walk looking straight past North Head to the ocean. Whilst below hidden amongst the rocks are the depression started artist shacks that was the beginning of much of the famous Australian artists. Finish up at the Manly Wharf Hotel or 4 Pines for a well earned thirst quencher."

However you can just do part of the walk or you can do what I do and walk to Manly, have lunch then walk back, you will be tired at the end of the day but you will love the beauty along the way whilst receiving a great workout. I have seen people do it in thongs or sandals, however there are lots of uneven steps and I think you should have good walking shoes.Take water as there is no where to get it on the walk and use a light day pack with some snacks and water. About half way there is a great coffee shop and nearby there are public toilets. I can't say how long it will take as everyone walks at a different pace and how often you stop to take in the views, but give it a go, you won't regret it"

Our 'go to' walk is Bondi to Coggee. This was a real treat. Fewer people, more challenging, and fabulous scenery and vistas. Seeing the variety of neighborhoods up close was an added bonus. Can't recommend this walk enough. We took the bus from downtown to the far side of the Bridge and walked down the stairs. We took the ferry back from Manly. A must do for anyone who wants to get away from the typical tourist attractions!"

The walk provides access to Clontarf (Sandy) and Washaway Beaches and some beautiful scenery, including littoral vegetation, harbour-front sandstone cliffs and historic squatters cottages, which are open on weekends for viewing.A short part of the walk into Manly is along the road before re-joining the esplanade and ending at Manly ferry wharf, where are plenty of places to eat and drink. A short walk through the Manly Mall brings you to the Manly ocean surf beach and if you're really keen you can continue south to Shelley Beach, which is quite sheltered and has some interesting diving."

At just under 10km, the walk should take around 2-3 hours depending on your fitness and of course how many times you stop to take pictures!The first km is fairly uneventful, skirting Fisher Bay with the sound of traffic still ringing in your ears. Clontarf Reserve is a super place for a picnic, with wide beaches, a netted swimming area and a great park and play area for kids. The next 5km take you round the edge of Dobroyd Head, giving you great views back to Balmoral and out towards the Tasman Sea. The path until Forty Baskets Beach is hard-packed dirt single-track, with plenty of steps - not suitable for rolling transport!Continuing from Forty Baskets Beach, the path is metalled all the way into Manly. If travelling with wheels, be sure to take Condamine Street up to Lauderdale Avenue, bypassing North Harbour Reserve, else continue up the steps and onto the spectacular harbour-side path.Toilets are located at Clontarf Reserve, North Harbour Reserve, Fairlight Beach and of course Manly, with water taps at each."

It is a moderate walk and takes you through Sydney Harbour National Park as well as a few suburban streets... To get to the start, your best bet is to either a) Drive to the Spit Bridge and walk to Manly, then catch a bus back to Spit Bridge. OR b) Bus to Spit Bridge and then either bus back to your destination and if your destination is in the city, a ferry back to Circular Quay is another option. It is advisable to take plenty of water and supplies with you as there are not that many facilities along the way and it can get quite hot during summer. Keep it a little on the light side though as it is a 10 km walk.Take your swimmers as there are opportunities to swim during summer.You will get plenty of chances for fabulous city and Manly pictures along the way and additionally there are aboriginal rock art works. Not really recommended for small children or prams as parts of the track can get a little rough.Ending up at Manly, there are plenty of eating opportunities as well as great beach.Highly recommended nature walk very close to the city and highlights the hidden beauty spot that are hidden all around Sydney.Note: As you travel though a National Park, Dogs and other domestic animals are not permitted."

At Spit Bridge, I was lucky enough to be able to witness the bridge rising in order to let boats pass through underneath, which was a real treat as I had never seen anything like that before. The walk itself was great- it was very tranquil, quiet and peaceful throughout. There were some tricky bits here and there where the path narrowed to the point where it couldn't have been more than a metre across, plus there sometimes would be trees and bushes obstructing the path every now and then which needed to be ducked under. Not exactly very well-maintained, but definitely not a reason to avoid doing the walk altogether and the good far outweigh the bad.It took about 4 to complete, and by the end I was pretty drained, so make sure that you're well-prepared by wearing comfortable shoes, applying sunscreen, and bringing lots of water. Overall, would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone willing to do a bit of walking."

After a couple of minutes we already saw some really nice, isolated beaches and had to push ourselves to not stop every 5 minutes. After about 2 hours, we found a completely isolated beach which we could only access by climbing over spiky rocks and getting all wet, but we had a beautiful beach full of shells to ourselves and probably spent 2 or 3 hours there. The entire walk is beautiful, on one hand the ocean is always on your left side, but on the other hand you feel like you're in the middle of a jungle with all kinds of small bridges and plants. I unfortunately forgot my sunscreen and after a sunny day in the Australian summer, I was very sunburnt, so don't forget your sunscreen! We took the bus back to the city from The Spit. If you only have limited time in Sydney and have to decide between this walk and the Bondi - Coogee Walk, definitely go with this one. Even though it's longer and more exhausting, it's absolutely worth it!"

Parts of it are along flat paved pathways, but most of it is bush track which includes rough patches with rock stairs. At times you will be using short sections of roadway.You need to be reasonably fit with good knees and hips due to the many ups and downs encountered. You will be rewarded however with great views over Manly and the Heads, as well as native flora and even Aboriginal rock carvings. Towards the end is a park where you can grab lunch or a coffee, or even have a swim. I generally do the walk in just under two hours, but that is at a reasonably fast pace.Pros- it's FREE- you get to see great views. Take a camera.- it's reasonably well signposted.- there is a coffee shop with lunch available towards the end- at the Spit are also coffee shops and places for lunch.- there are a few water bubblers along the way but mainly in the first section within small park areas that you walk through. I suggest you carry some water.Cons- you need a reasonable degree of fitness for some sections involving steps.- the track could be sloppy in wet weather- you could accidentally get side-tracked in some places if you don't find the direction signs.- only the first small part of the way in wheelchair accessible.Suggestions- take a camera- take some water- wear good flat shoes with traction- wear sunscreen and a hat- look out for the path direction signs and check the maps which are placed at various spots along the route.To get there, catch the Manly ferry to Manly wharf, leave the wharf and turn left towards the aquarium.At the Spit, walk across the bridge, cross to the western side of the road and catch the bus back to Manly (route 143 or 144). The stop is about 100m from the southern end of the bridge, directly across the road from Zest Waterfront Venues.Enjoy beautiful Sydney."

Caught the 180 bus from the city to Spit Bridge to start the walk so we could finish at Manly, have a bite to eat/cup of coffee and then travel back to the city via the Manly Ferry. Suggest you hop off at the stop just before the Spit Bridge as there are clean toilets in the park, and you can then walk over the Spit Bridge before commencing the Walk. The walk took us 3.5 hrs, which included a stop for lunch and also a swim at the beautiful quiet little Reef Beach. The walk is not too challenging and is very scenic with beautiful views of the Harbour. The Aboriginal Rock Carvings at the Grotto are also very interesting. Take your swimmers as there are a number of quiet beaches along the way. At some places you may get your feet wet or have to take a short diversion if it is high tide. We saw some lovely wildflowers, a few bush turkeys and a number of water dragons. A great walk, definitely recommend it."

Not a strenuous walk, just kinda long, kinda hot with some killer views as well as ups and downs.Ferry over from Sydney and Take a cab (~$20) from ferry to the bridge spit. Easy trail and well maintained. Up hills and down hills. Takes 2 plus hours. I liked this walk better than Bondi to Coogee. Much more varied walk and terrain. I say do both!

Recommend starting at Spit Bridge so you can end in Manley, have a beer and get the ferry back to Circular Quay. You can catch the bus outside the QVB, every 15 mins or so, 30-35 min journey. Get off at the Spit Bridge stop, virtually on the bridge, cross the bridge and turn right. We made the mistake of going on one further stop, ending up in the suburbs and doubling back. The first short stage is along a suburban fore-shore but the walk gets quieter with great sea views. Loos available along the way."

If you are specially lucky around Christmas you might see some red and gold Christmas Bells. Either catch a bus to the Spit Bridge - the walk starts from the northern side. Once you have reached Manly there is either the harbour pool or a short walk to the surf for a refreshing swim.

We spotted plenty of lizard varieties basking along the path. Take water & snacks but remember no bins along this walk I assume because of wildlife so please don't spoil this wonderful environment and take litter home with you. When you get near to Manly the walk takes you through a residential area & park but this is interesting to see the houses in this prestigious location.

Dont rush. take water and snacks. well marked path. huge diversity of native plants on the way. great views of sydney harbour and manly. We have done many of the walks around sydney harbour and this is one of the most challenging so take your time. the harder bits are in the first 1/3 of the walk from the spit. You really enjoy food and drinks at one of the many Manly restaurants or cafes when you get there!! If the temperature was much more than low 30s I would not do it on that day. Morning would be best and low tide is better than high tide. We saw quite a few eastern australian water dragons on the walk which are always great to see. Stopping at the Arabanoo Lookout is worth it later in the walk. When you read that cafes are on the way (in some websites they mean at the end of the walk as there are none for 90% of the walk."

The walk takes you through some beautiful suburban areas of Manly, with spectacular, ever changing views of the coastline and harbour. The path is gently undulating to begin with, but there are some short steep climbs along the route. The path is well managed, but is some places, steps are in need of repair and you need to watch your footing. This is evidently about to be rectified as concrete blocks had already been delivered to areas of bad wear.We took the walk on a warm (31C) afternoon. There was plenty of shade, but it is essential to carry water as we did not see anywhere on route where we could have obtained any.On the day we walked, the tide was relatively low and we were able to enjoy long stretches of the walk on the foreshore. In one place this involved a scrabble over some rocks. We do not know whether we missed the path markings, or if this was the intended route. However, it was great fun and added some extra interest to our walk. There is an alternative higher path if the tide is in.The path is marked as being about 8km. It felt longer, and took us about 3 hours to complete, taking our time and enjoying the scenery, but ceratinly was not unpleasant and we would recommend"

Being prepared for all weather elements in an unseasonal period of Sydney weather, we took in the sights of the Spit Bridge and nearby boats and the occasional boathouse, as we wended our way across sandstone steps and winding paths. Barely into our walk the heavens opened and we were forced to shelter in a convenient marina at Sandy Bay to wait out the downpour. Most of the remainder of the walk took in spectacular harbour views, including long distance views of the Sydney Heads and the Manly Ferry as we made our way along the ever ascending and descending sets of steps of the walk path. At one point we found diverted to Grotto Point to take in primitive Aboriginal stone carvings of fish, whales and kangaroos. The big weather disappointment came within a few kilometers of Manly, when an approaching jogger warned us off the track due to heavy flooding. The resultant detour cost us several kilometers and considerable time in making a 2+ hour walk into a 3+ hour ( and very tiring) trek. None-the-less, the Spit to Manly walk is worth the effort and the views, including colourful flora, along the way make it very rewarding for the photographer."

If you enjoy bush walking, the Spit to Manly walk is a good option when in the Sydney area and affords excellent views of the Harbour, City, and Manly. It follows the coast line from the Spit Bridge through bushland, and round a number of bays and inlets. Around 2 hours (assuming you aren't stopping too frequently). If travelling from the the city, a bus to the Spit, and the ferry back from Manly is what I'd recommend."

A long walk, with many steps, some quite steep. Some stepped areas currently under upgrade. The walk is teasing, as although Manly ferry area is in sight, the path goes well away as it follows the bay. It took us about 3 hours,as an older couple,but if you want to stop and look at all the side paths on the way, allow much longer. Make sure you walk it with enough light to finish, and when cooler but not wet, as it could be difficult on some of the steeply stepped areas. Manly is a great place to visit, with lots of places to eat after the effort."

I grew up in this area and always love doing the Spit to Manly walk. The views are spectacular and while you're never very far from houses, there are parts where you really feel like you have 'escaped' the city. If you're moving at a good pace, it will take about 2 hours. Make sure you have water and sunscreen and if it's been raining, be careful as it can be a bit muddy and slippery. There are lots of cafes in Manly to grab a coffee and a bite at the end (try Cartel or Fika) and it's really easy to catch a bus back to the Spit bridge or a ferry back into the city."

We started our walk from the Spit Bridge which is located on the harbour side of the bridge, there is ample signage to direct you in the right direction. If in doubt just walk along the foreshore to Clontarf Beach and you will come across the bush track at the very end of the beach and once there the route is clearly marked. The walk took us about 2 hours with a few stops at spectacular vantage points to take snap shots of the views over Sydney Harbour. We were blessed to have the most glorious sunny day - there was a slight breeze and the sun sparkled on the water - the views are just magnificent and breathtaking! The walk itself I found fairly easy with well marked tracks and as it had rained a couple of day prior there were a few muddy areas yet just take your time stepping around or through the wet puddles. At the end of the walk you traverse through a park past quaint residential streets before hitting the busy Manly Wharf precinct. Once in Manly there are many established restaurants and fast food outlets at the ferry wharf together with the Manly Wharf Pub .The ferry will take you back to the city or catch a bus the city or along the jump off at The Spit Bridge to jump back into your car. I would suggest to go early morning before it gets too warm as there isn't always much shade. Do wear comfy walking shoes, wear a hat, take a camera or your mobile phone, a water bottle and a beach towel for a dip at Manly Beach. This beautiful coastal walk is a fun experience. Highly recommend it!"

Lots of small bays and sandy beaches with clean, clear water - great for a quick dip. You walk through a beautiful red gum forest and will see some wildflowers depending on the time of year. Choose a cool day if possible, bring lunch and water, wear comfy shoes and a hat. There are a lot of 'up' stairs if you start.from The Spit end, less if you start from Manly but I would recommend starting at The Spit because you do the hardest bit first when you are fresh, and the stroll into Manly is a lovely end to the walk.and there are lots of places for a cold drink or dinner in Manly. We love to go to the Steyne Hotel which overlooks the surfing beach. I'm 61 and not super fit but apart from the stairs which I find tiring, this walk is certainly doable. We allow about 4 1/2 hours which includes stopping for lunch as well as regular stops to enjoy the views. If coming from the city, catch a bus from Carrington Street behind Wynyard and alight BEFORE The Spit bridge. It's fun to walk across it and admire the view!"

It doesn't matter where you start, The Spit or Manly. There is food at both ends and a bus to return you to your starting point at the end, unless you have 2 cars.The special way to do it is find out when the tide is going OUT and start at Manly and walk over the rocks which are high and dry. Then climb up at Crater Cove and join the walking track. You can do it the opposite way if you can find the track down to the cottages at Crater Cove and then down to the rocks. Its a bit more difficult to start with but worth it either way.We have done it often and never had a problem, but don't risk the tide coming in unless you start right at or just before low tide. You will be able to scramble up along the rocks but you need to know where the track is to join it.Have fun. Take shoes that may get wet and are comfortable on rocks."

We decided to take this route for ease of logistics.The trail itself is well marked and easy to follow - not easy to get lost unless you try really hard. You will also find that this trail is able to cater to various needs for different people - the tourists (like us), health freaks (runners, joggers, walkers etc), families & friends (catch up sessions), pet owners with their pet dogs* and even couples on dates! Having said this, it is not suitable for families with young children or strollers. You will be walking on wooden platforms, sand paths, gravel paths, steps cut out of stones, the beach, pavement and even lanes through the houses in the suburbs. Not all routes are dog-friendly, watch out for alternate routes. Also, in cases where it is high tide (makes you wonder what the actual route is like right?), there will be alternate routes for you to take to continue the walk.There at least 20 points of interest. The main attraction however would be the breath taking views you will be rewarded with. Along the way, we also discovered that Manly is home to the endangered Little Penguins and it is the only mainland breeding colony in New South Wales. Cute little \"Watch Out Penguins About\" signs are visible on the pathway. Some tips if you are planning to do this: - wear walking/sport shoes or comfortable footwear - apply plenty of sunblock as you are exposed to the sun alot (or you can wear a light long sleeve t-shirt. You'll sweat a bit more but at least the skin is protected).- bring ample of water (recommended 1 liter per person) - bring along light snacks - carry along a raincoat/poncho. Umbrella might not be suitable at certain areas. - don't forget your camera. Getting there and back: We took the bus to Spit Bridge and the ferry back to Circular Quay.

For an experience that showcases the diversity of Sydney Harbour,there is nothing to beat the Spit Bridge to Manly Walk. While gawking at the mammoth houses that line the shores of Clontarf,we were floored by the amount of secret beaches at Castle Rock reserve. Our gentle meander included smaller tracks that adjoin the main walkway.... 10 km in all. We took five hours including lunch at Reef Beach. I would suggest to bring towel,swimmers and snorkelling gear and good shoes to slip in and out of. Showers are available at all the spots. So here is the plan. Hop on a bus at Wynyard disembarking at Spit Junction and once you crossed the bridge on foot,turn right onto the trail. the walk is well-signed,with detours for those looking for of-track adventures. The terrain is varied. One minute you will be walking on cement footpath,sandy trail the next followed by rock staircases. The views that greet you towards North and South Heads are second to none. Absolutely spectacular,with wildlife spotting a certainty. At Grotto point there are aboriginal engravings giving a background to the history of this area. Once you get to Manly reward yourself with a long and cool drink or late lunch before catching the ferry back to Circular Quay. By the way,if you sit on the right-hand side of the ferry,you can see some of the coastline you have just walked along,albeit, with a different perspective of the beaches and lookouts you have just visited.

Its easy to get back to the city with buses and a ferry option.A general level of fitness is required but the walk isnt too steep and has a clear path with steps (no bush bashing). Maybe dont wear thongs! I see alot of people in some truly terrible footwear, proper shoes will be more comfortable. Lastly, some sections cant be accessed during high tide so you will have to take the alternative route on the road."

This walk can be done in either direction, but Spit Bridge to Manly is best for pub and food options at the end and a ferry back to Circular Quay. The harbour and city skyline views are spectacular; the landscape changes from rainforest gullies to wildflower-strewn heathland to cliffs and beaches; wildlife runs to eastern water dragons, a variety of birds, occasionally dolphins and rarely fairy penguins.This walk is popular on weekends, so opt for a weekday if you prefer nature uninterrupted by cyclists and joggers. Take water. There's little in the way of food and drink along the way."

The views are spectacular and at times it is hard to believe that you are in the middle of Sydney. You go from the water's edge to cliff top views of Sydney Harbour and back down again. My favourite section is Reef Beach to Castle Rock Beach. That covers Crater Cove, Dobroyd Head and Castle Rock Beach. We've done that with a 6 year old, who had no problems. The paths are well maintained and well sign posted. On a sunny day, this is an unbeatable experience."

I tend to walk from Manly, to the Spit, and then walk across the bridge, and catch a bus to the city. The views on the walk are awesome, so make sure you take your camera with you. There is a small cafe in a wall near the end of the walk, near the public toilets, behind a larger restaurant, at the spit, which does nice cheese and tomato toasted sandwiches, and hot chips. If you are in Sydney for a few days, I suggest you get the weekly day tripper pass, which costs about 3 times the daily day tripper pass price, but lasts for a week. Then you can catch buses, trains, and ferries, all using the same pass, which is most helpful if you are staying in Manly, but are going to the city most days."

I really enjoyed it as It is such an interesting varied walk with great views of the harbour . A certain level of fitness is required as there are inclines, numerous steps, narrow rocky paths, and road walking involved. The scenery is really nice and there are areas to rest or have a picnic. if you remember to bring your togs, you can even go for a swim ! On the day we walked-- a Monday-- the walkway was quiet --there were few walkers and no joggers. Watch out for the wildlife-- hedgehogs, lizards and numerous birds. Manly was our destination where we had some delicious ice cream and a stroll around before taking the ferry back to Circular Quay. Brilliant day out ."

Depending on what pace and fitness level you are, may take 2 to 3 hours to walk the path (though those fit people running it would do it in the hour). Wear some good shoes, quite a few spots where it is wet from the natural water run offs that make some areas a little slippery."

I saw lizards, various birds and flying fish, a few yachts and kayakers, lots of fancy houses, and a great mix of terrains. I took the bus from Manly to Spit (143/144, stance D opposite the ferry) and walked towards Manly, so it was nice and quiet in the first stage. The final bit, walking through Manly, was a bit less interesting - a wander through the suburb - but was ok because it meant a beer was near.Some bits of the path near Spit Bridge are very narrow and pretty steep."
