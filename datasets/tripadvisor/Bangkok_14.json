Haha, it's not so, you can visit at anytime as you like. The opening hours is 8.30-6pm everyday. At N8 pier, you only have to spend another 3baht for the fee of crossing the river (one trip, return another 3baht) as the wat is located at the west bank of Chao Phraya River.Wat Arun has been the Royal Temple which dedicated to the 2nd reign of Chakkri Dynasty. Here is the most elegant pagoda, landmark of Thai. There are some formalities of visiting Wat Arun Rajwararam: dress code, not to climb the rail, not to dangle any doll, not to drop cigarette and waste on the floor. The entrance fee is 50baht, inside there's another 50baht fee for another wat visit (optional). For man, short pant is allowed. For women, short pant and shirt sleeve shirt are not allowed. But you can find certain stalls that sell long pants or ever the admission provide clothes rental service with additional charge. When I visited the wat in October'16, it is under minor renovation."

This wat is easy to find, everybody knows where it is and it has a nearly directly ferry to the location from downtown Bangkok. The evening view is dazzling and highly recommended to be viewed from a boat as it is all lit up. During the day, the 50B fee to enter is cheap compared to others. We found it on foot without a problem, arriving from a more northern location. The wat was smaller in square feet than expected but much taller than we thought it would be. The individual tile work is amazing and looks pain staking. When we were there they were doing some reconstruction work; we saw most, not every inch, but it was nice to see that our money was going directly to reconstruction. Despite the residential location and the surrounding alleyways, we felt no reason to be worried about safety upon arriving nor leaving."

There are also a number of small traders selling the usual street merch, chances to dress-up and explore the number of other spiritual buildings and statues in the surrounding area."

Architecturally, the wat is said to represent Mount Meru, the centre of the Buddhist universe. The main structure at Wat Arun is currently undergoing repairs, so it is covered in scaffolding and not looking its best. But it was still worth a visit, with an entry fee of only 50 baht (less than $2).The easiest way for me to get to the Chao Phraya River from the Sukhumvit area was via BTS Skytrain. An interchange at Siam Station allowed me to switch from the Sukhumvit Line to the Silom Line. I then rode the Silom Line to Saphan Taksin station, which is adjacent to the main Central Pier on the river. From Central Pier, I caught an orange flag water taxi up to Pier 8 and then jumped onto a ferry to get to Wat Arun on the opposite side of the river."

We took a ferry from pier no. 8 for (I think) 30bht (1 adult and 1 child). The grounds were pretty empty only approx 25 tourists. While the Palace had hundreds (felt like thousands) ! It's currently being renovated, but that doesn't stop the feeling of magnitude of height. Great little out door coffee shop outside for a relaxing drink / ice cream in the shade with fans that spray a cool mist!!"

It's a little bit different from the other Wats, since this one is left white and the colors are all given by broken chinese porcelain mosaic. It is required here to dress properly (shoulders and knees covered) but in case you are not, at the entrannce they give you skirts or pants for around 20 baht rent fee. The entrance fee is 50 baht what you have to pay at a little cabin across the entrance. The area of this temple is not that big but the building is very impressive and interesting. You can also walk up and down of the big stairs leading to the towers. It' a beautiful and one of a kind temple."

You can get there by taking the ferry to cross the river at the same pier where you get off for the Wat Pho which is N-8. there are two booths that collect money, facing the water coming from the market, the booth on the left is the one you want. Can't go wrong, there is a clear sign that indicates it crosses to Wat Arun. It's 3 bahts/person one way. Coming back is another 3 bahts. Up close it is still majestic but with construction ongoing it kinds of puts a damper on the overall effect. The best I have seen Wat Arun is from a river cruise or even just from the Chao Praya tourist boat at sunset and at night. The place is lit up and it looks like an exotic fairy tale castle. Then you can say, wow you are really in Thailand! There is a fee to go inside the temple but the grounds are free. So get your camera ready."

It is currently undergoing refurbishment and is covered in scaffolding. This prevents you from climbing the stairs all the way to the top. You can go up a short distance and look out over the river. The stairs are pretty steep, not sure what it would be like coming all the way down from the top. The ceramics on this temple are simply amazing and beautiful. The grounds are very well maintained, and there is the usual market stalls to buy anything you might, or might not, need, including drinks and icecream. Would love to have seen it without the scaffolding, so I might be back. To the people who advise you not to go over, but to admire it from the other side: you are doing a dis-service. You cannot admire the beauty of the building from that far away. Get off your butt and go over there! I agree with another comment about the 150baht tourist ticket, it's not worth it. Just pay for individual trips, unless you intend to visit enough places in one day to make it worthwhile."

You can walk around the complex and get up close to the spire. This is a nice example of using porcelain as the decorative surface of structures. Its basic white color gives it a pearly shine in the morning sun, probably where the temple of dawn name comes from."

I don't think it is worth the entry fee if the scaffolding is still there, as you can only climb up to half way up the structure. They have a nice small garden outside the temple, and it's accessible to everyone. We took less than 30 minutes to go around this temple, I'm not sure it was worth the hassle of crossing the river, again only because it was under renovation and the top parts of the temple was not accessible."

Personally, I'm not a fan of big crowds and super touristy areas, which is the feel of the Grand Palace. Wat Arun is great because it's a little more low key and less crowded, so it feels quite peaceful visiting there. I would definitely opt for taking a cab rather than taking a tuk-tuk, who charge outrageous fees and tried aggressively to persuade us to take an expensive boat across the river."

Now for those that don\u2019t know or have never been, its an exceptional half day out with many sites to take in, we were staying in a hotel near Soi Cowboy so from the Asoke BTS in front of Terminal 21 Shopping Mall, we boarded the sky train and got off at Siam. The total one way trip to our last destination being Saphan Taksin was 42 baht a head although they have day passes for unlimited rides. At Siam we went down a level and got onto another sky train to get to Saphan Taksin, this is all a little confusing, if you don\u2019t look at the train line maps on the walls, you could end up getting on the wrong train or going the wrong direction, which we did on the return leg. Once at Saphan Taksin, it\u2019s a 50 metre walk to the Pier, which is also Pier No.1 , our intended destination was Tha Tien Pier No.8 but the girl on the ferry gave quite a bit of info before every stop.The one way trip cost 40 baht a head but you could get a full day unlimited pass for 150 baht, if you wanted to stop off and see other attractions such as King\u2019s Palace, Chinatown, Floating Market, Flower Market, Wat Pho (Reclining Budha), River City Mall and many other stops. For Wat Arun, when you get off at Pier No.8, you just go next door and hop on another boat for 3 baht which takes you across the river and you\u2019re there. We also wanted to climb up the Wat for its exceptional view which Ive done before but it was a first for the miss's, unfortunately it was closed for renovations and I was quite annoyed that the farang (westerner) had to pay 50 baht entry but nobody advised me that renovations were taking place,all in all, a great day out, the river ride and the breeze a welcoming change."

Even if you been in Thailand many times and don't think of that country as of a hub of fine arts like Italy, for example, you are probably right, but it turns out that you had no time to dig deep.  In past it was beautiful, and Thai people made significant efforts to conserve the best artifacts of past. Give it a try, seriously! I was deeply impressed by ingenious and skillfull appearance of Wat Arun, although it's famous steepest staircase is closed for renovation till 2018 ! Most people visit this place solely to make a crazy selfie in the top of this temple and get disappointed when they realize, that steep staircase is closed.But let's just take a closer look and you will find out, that it's very magnificient : just imagine ( and take a look at the attached photos ) -- it's white walls are covered with numerous plates, which were made from Chinese porcelain! And at the top of this Wat there are gem stones, embedded in handrails! Everything look very fresh like if the time have no power here and the temple was built yesterday.Pay special attention to little stone figures, which are put along the perimeter of the wall. They are very expressive and unique ( their faces and poses never repeat and have deep symbolical meaning ).Also internal garden is in very good condition and it worth to have a little walk, if you like.Pay special attention to the fact, that it's not simple to get an express boat back to Central pier from here, you better ask local policemans for help or just pay 15THB and use regular boat, which will make a couple of stops along the way ( but to me it's still reasonably fast ) I traveled alone using BTS from Central world and express boat from Central Pier and paid funny 40 THB for a boat. Be careful! Locals are extremely misleading everywhere and you can obtain ticket for 100THB and more ( even 800 ) and in fact be a victim of local microbusiness. If you wanted to travel in 'official' ( i.e. municipal ) express boat from the Central Pier, then look for blue counter with 'Express boat' plate and expect to pay 40 THB there. When in boat listen carefully and when they will announce, that the boat is approaching to N8 -- leave here and take a boat to the opposite side of a river ( another 3 THB )."

Wat Arun was fantastic and must be seen up close to be appreciated - as you approach by ferry across the Chao Phraya river, but is a majestic looking temple - but the divine is in the details!Our guide mentioned about the Chinese porcelain which became popular at about the time Wat Arun began construction when the King of Bangkok lived here on the WEST side of the river - something about a sunken ship if memory serves me correctly..In any case - when you get close to the temple - it really comes alive with beauty - the only reason I did not rate 5 bubbles is due to large scale maintenance and scaffolding coverting the main central \"stupa\" (spire/tower) at the middle of the structure during our visit. When you see the detailed ceramic work however - it is understandable this will require almost constant maintenance and repair...We did not get to enter the central temple during our visit - We did however visit a shrine out by the entrance near the river where there is a venerated figure of the King of Bangkok - (from before the reign of the current Ramas) with his sword across his lap - we participated in the fun tradition of climbing under the bed in front of the king - and then as you pass under - you look to the king for favor and kindness - neat - You will enjoy Wat Arun - there are THOUSANDS of temples in Thailand, but this was much unlike any of the others we visited during our stay. Don't forget your sunscreen if you are light skinned - the sun can be very intense reflected by all that white ceramic."

It does however have a large population of homeless cats, some of whom are friendly as they're fed by the monks. This was a definite plus for me as I love animals. It also has beautiful gardens outside the temple complex and some beautiful architecture.Not Bangkok's prettiest temple, but if you have time spare it's worth a visit."

Easy to see juat across the river, you can take a picture with thai costum here with 200 baht, and there's a souvenir corner near the restroom which they can speak indonesian and use Rupiah.. so far this this temple is still in maintance but you can still take picture here and get around the temple.. there's a place to pray to Budha and..because this is the open space..it's better to go at the evening.. from this temple you can go back to the pier again from the place you go and visit Khaosan road or go to see china town at night"

A temple has been at the site since the kingdom of Ayutthaya (c. late 17th Century) and originally held the Emerald Buddha. The most identifiable part of the temple is its Khmer-style 'prang' which is unique for Bangkok and reminiscent of the architecture of Angkor. This tower and its four smaller sides represent Mount Meru and the corners of the Earth which is central to Buddhist and Hindu cosmology. The prang is decorated with faience creating a strange mix of color in the large grey structure. It is a unique and worthwhile building to visit whilst in Bangkok. Wat Arun is probably the only site you will want to visit in Thonburi unless you enjoy a walk or bike ride to the unremarkable temples and parks to the south. Access to the temple is via ferry which has a station directly at the base of the temple. There is a adjacent temple complex with an ordination hall to explore after visiting the tower. Temple hours are about 7:30 to 5:30. The entry fee is 50 baht. The climb up the tower gives a great view, but is quite high and the stairs remarkably steep, so it is not for the faint of heart or those with limited mobility. Keep in mind that the temple experiences frequent restoration works - it is, after all, a very old structure."

But the view of the Chao Phraya river and the neighborhood is worth it. When i visited in January 2016, the third level was closed for reconstruction.Strict dress code is to be followed, no shorts/short skirts, no sleeveless tops.

The best way to travel to the temple is to take BTS Sky train to Siam station and walk 5 minutes to the river boat taxi and take a local river boat for only 20 bath. There are also some tourist boat taxis that departs from the same station and they have someone on board describing every single stops, it's history and the attractions.

Wat Arun is the most photographed structure in Bangkok (especially during sunset), and understandably so. It is simply gorgeous up close and from afar. I took the Chao Phraya \"cross river\" ferry from the Wat Pho stop. The maps for Chao Phraya is everywhere in Bangkok so it's impossible to miss this. I also have my Lonely Planet: Thailand book which has good recommendations on walking tours, which includes this temple. When you enter the Wat Arun compound, you'll be amazed by its stunning design. It's simply majestic! And, you get to climb the temple too. Be careful though, the stairs are pretty narrow, and steep. However, your effort climbing up won't be left unrewarded. The views from the top is amazing and gives you a panoramic view of the Chao Phraya river and the old Bangkok. This temple should definitely be a part of any itinerary in Bangkok!"

We visited in May 2016 and there are currently restoration works being carried out at the moment which does impact on the overall feel of the place.However we jumped off when on the tourist water taxi (40 bht- one stop off) and got the ferry across to see the temple (3bht). Nice to go across the river and definitely worth doing and remember you appropriate dress!!"

When I was there, they were doing an extensive renovations/cleaning, so parts of it were obscured by scaffolding, etc. Still, it was amazing to see this colossal structure up close! Early mornings are the best time to go for photos, I've heard, but it was still lovely in the afternoon. It can get rather crowded, and in the heat, the narrow stairs are tough to climb, but it's very worth doing.My warning/advice, though, is to do your research. First, figure out how to get there before you leave your hotel so that you don't get misled by scammers who prey on tourists. They'll try to \"take\" you there, for a fee, or say that it's closed when it really isn't. They may also take you to souvenir stands where they get a kickback for the tourists they bring.The other warning is that you need to dress modestly, as with most temples in Thailand. Cover your knees and shoulders, regardless of gender. If you forget, they do have scarves or other outerwear available for rent, but it's time consuming to stop and get it."

You might want to take a public bus over the river and taxi it from there. DEF no tuk tuks...they are more expensive than a taxi. I thought the temple was unique and really admired the detail. One of my favorite attractions in bangkok"

You can visit the Grand Palace and/or Temple of the Reclining Buddha \uff08Wat Pho \uff09.Since i have visited both during my previous trip, i decided to give them a miss and choose Wat Arun instead.To go to Wat Arun, take a short ride across Choa Praya River for 3baht. Since I was blessed to visit the temple during Songkran, the surroundings were abuzzed with activities. You have to pay 50baht to enter the temple. Please wear proper dress code(applicable to all other temples and the Grand Palace as a mark of respect to Buddha and the Royal). They offer you a cloth to wrap around if you didn't, so not to worry.A little regret though during my visit. The stupa was under maintenance/ renovation. Otherwise, I could have climbed up the steep stairs to the top to view the surroundings. I went during the morning. It wasn't so hot and humid. Hope to visit again in the near future when the maintainence/ renovation of the stupa is completed."

My advice is please come early as this spot will close around 3pm even i came here pretty early around 8.30am but a bunch of ppl was already around this area. There have many temple surrounding that you can visit. If you are hungry ariund thus area there have a lot local hawkers store to fill your stomach empty. Trust me is was a fantastic food around this area. Just be careful with a tuk-tuk scam around temple. They maybe trick you and saying the temple is close before taking you to another place for the comission. This place is open everyday. Please walk further if you decided to leave this place if ask for the taxi."

This meant the grounds were sparse, the areas we could go in were limited and we definitely could not go in and up the temple itself so felt like a wasted trip. I'm sure if you were to go inside you would see much the same as the other temples in BKK but for us, not very impressed based on what we saw, which was very little unfortunately."

Being on the opposite side of the river to the other main attractions (although easily accessed via a shuttle boat costing only 10 baht), it was significantly quieter and therefore more serene than the other sites I visited. There were still plenty of details to admire amongst the buildings, and it was peaceful sitting in the shade and taking it all in. I look forward to revisiting when the restoration is compete and the buildings can be seen in all their glory!"

The many buildings and smaller temples are beautiful; and the architecture is fantastic. Tourists pay a small fee to enter the site and walk around at their own pace. We met a monk who was friendly and tied a small ribbon around our wrists, which was fun. Highly suggest taking a bottle of water with you and a hat to protect you from the sun.

One of Bangkok\u2019s most famous landmarks , the Wat Arun is best known for its massive prang, a tower on the Chao Phra river bank built in Khmer architectural style. The prang with its height of more than 80 meters is the highest in Thailand. The Wat Arun, commonly known as \u201cthe Temple of Dawn\u201d, is one of only six temples of the highest grade of the first class Royal Temples, and therefore one of Thailand\u2019s most revered temples.There was renovation works going on when I went this Feb 2016 so I jus walked around the temple and took some stunning views snaps.Wat Arun temple can be better enjoyed in the evening. The prang or the tower was raised to its current height of over 80 meters. The Khmer style tower is decorated with millions of small pieces of colorful Chinese porcelain, which in those days used as ballast on ships from China.A steep stairway on the side of the prang leads up to a terrace. You can climb the stairway giving a nice view of the river and surrounding area. Because the stairs are very steep and narrow it is not possible to go all the way up. Around the main prang are four similar smaller prangs. Although the Wat Arun is known for its impressive prang there are other buildings that are worth investigating. The main prayer room holds the principal Buddha image of the Wat Arun. Around the central prang are four mondops or pavilions enshrining Buddha images representing four important occurrences in the life of the Buddha,namely birth, first sermon in Sarnath to five monks, enlightenment and passing into final nirvana. The cloister of the temple complexbcontains more than 100 Buddha images. A mondop houses a copy of the Buddha\u2019s footprint. A number of very large guardian statues in the Wat Arun are very similar to those in the Grand Palace. On the river side you will find a number of salas (open air pavilions). The Wat Arun or Temple of Dawn is located on Wat Arun Amarin Road on the West bank of the Chao Phraya river,opposite the Wat Pho temple and the Grand Palace. The best way to get there is by boat. Take a Chao Phraya express boat to Tha Tien pier at the Grand Palace on the East bank of the river. From there, cross the river with the Tha Tien express boat. During the short ride you will have excellent views and photo opportunities of the huge Wat Arun prang. "

The reclining Buddha is the stage of all knowledge and \"nirvana\".The pieces of broken colorful pottery and the various ornaments and statues are so beautiful and unique, very pretty.Walking around is about an hour and then I walked onto the river side and crossed the river to Wat Po and the Palace. It was a lovely short crossing and the cost was 3 Baht (around five or ten pence). The crossings are regular and are the best way to get back to the old city.Stunning place, I would grant it number two attraction in Bangkok, the Grand Palace being number 1.The main Chedi is being renovated and will be done by \"Fall 2016\". However you can still see all the detail, just not climb to get a view from the high steps.Highly recommended to visit."

Take care of those who want to trick you in the streets of Bangkok telling you that \"today is the only day that the temple is oppened to visitors(the inside of the temple they mean) and you should hurry to see it\" and they offer to call a tuk-tuk for you for a low price and then reccomend a place where you can take a boat just for you and your friends for a small amount of money (3500 bht) taking into consideration that the other boats cost about 6000bht. It's a big trap. A cruise on the river shouldn't cost more than 800 bht/person(and you can easily negociate it at 600)if you want a private boat, or max 100 bht if you take the ferryboat. I enjoyed more the Great Palace and the Wat Pho Temple."

The temple gets its name from the rising sun and dates back to the 17th century. The central tower is made from coloured porcelain. One of Bangkok's prettiest temples. One can climb up the steep steps and go up the tower. However, if one is scared of heights, going back down is a scary experience!"

The ticket price should have reflected that, but there was no discount. That being said, what we could see and do was stunning. Exquisite carvings and craftsmanship. There were very few people there because, I'm sure, they knew what we didn't. If you're going from the Grand Palace, take the boat for 3baht across the river."

So we decided not to visit the temple.But as I wanted to capture Wat Arun, I went to the park beside Chao Phraya River , opposite to Wat Arun. I got an amazing view of the temple during sunset and got some superb clicks.There are restaurants like The DECK in Arun residence, where you can get good food and a good view :)But we decided to enjoy the local street food which are available in plenty near the park, and enjoyed the cool breeze of the river and offcourse the sunset from Wat Arun. Really a breathtaking site to see."

But because it has just one main building, doesn't need that much time.Our tour guide gave us maybe a 10 minute talk about the temple and then gave us another 30 to hang out and take photos. As of March 2016, it is under MAJOR RESTORATION. They are repainting the entire monument by HAND! I would NEVER suggest to skip something just because it's under renovation. Most of the temple is still open and it is still worth it. You are able to climb the temple still. just not to the top as I hear you're able to. Absolutely stunning! I'm sure it will be even more amazing when it is completed, especially at night!Time: About 30 minutes."

The small temple with the emerald buddha was my favourite of my whole trip to Thailand, there is something quite humble about him compared to some. The market stalls within the enclosure was a bit disconcerting....all selling the same things...I don;t know how they are all surviving. This Wat compared to all other we saw actually had more sellers than any within the grounds....I wonder if it is to pay for some of the work but couldn't be sure. There were massive incense sticks burning as well, and decorations seems to be up with Chinese New Year in mind.Overall a lovely spot, and the boat trip across the river fun!"

We knew ahead of time that Wat Arun was having work done on it when we would be visiting Bangkok. that did not deter us from visiting the grounds as part of a tour where we chose what we wanted to see (check out Your Thai Guide on tripadvisor). the company also informed us about the temple work. our guide, Nina, even recommended during our visit not to stand too close to the scaffolding so as to avoid any possibility of falling objects. Luckily we did not see or hear any falling objects. Due to the modifications taking place the grounds are not as busy. Despite the scaffolding you still can appreciate the shape and construction of Wat Arun. The temple grounds are not large and as many people realize you must traverse the Chao Phraya River to get to Wat Arun. As this was our first foray to Bangkok I do not know if the innards of the temple are normally open to the public or not. There is a smaller temple on the grounds closer to the river's edge where you can be blessed, for a small donation, by a monk who will also apply a colorful wristband on you. One can also catch a longboat in front of the temple. Now let's talk about the night view. As with many of the temples in Bangkok they are lighted at night and Wat Arun is stunning in its orangish glow. Alongside the river there are probably many places to be able to view Wat Arun at night but we were fortunate to view the night version of Wat Arun from The Eagles Nest at Sala Arun, which is a rooftop bar directly across the river. Absolutely a view to die for. For all the temples in Bangkok I wanted to see Wat Arun and Wat Saket."

To see all the water traffic so close was great.Being close to Wat Arun you can see all the magnificent details in its construction, and then you can climb the big steps to the top and see the city from a higher place.Finally from the other side of the river it was really enjoyable to watch the monument at dusk until its illumination comes on and turns it a golden marvel."

There's 3 shuttle pier on Sathorn. On the left it's pier for free shutle boat to Asiatique. On the middle is where you can get a public boat that cost only about 13 baht per person, you will PAY ON THE BOAT. Don't pay a ticket from the pier, it's expensive and its for a tour with longtail boat. On the right side, its a pier with a 100 BAHT TICKET PER PERSON! So remember to take the middle pier, and PAY THE TICKET ON THE BOAT!From Tha Tien pier, you can get a boat to cross the river (because Wat Arun is on the other side) for 3 baht per person.Have a nice trip y'all!"

The central structure is under construction, but the rest is still open and you can walk around the complex. From the Wat Pho side, the boat ride take a few minutes and is 2.5baht. There is a public pier on the Wat Pho side so you can catch the boat back to Saphin Taksin station or other attractions. The Tourist boat also stops at this pier.After the renovation, Wat Arun would be a definite must-see in Bangkok! I would also recommend seeing it at night when its lit up."

We recently saw it and even with the construction and restrictions, it is worth the 3 bhat ferry ride across the river (Chao Phraya) and the 2.5 ferry ride back to the Tha Tian (Tien?) pier. Of course wear enough clothing to gain entrance after paying 100 bhat fee. Otherwise you pay 20 bhat more to rent clothing to be covered properly. Get there before 6 PM gate closing. When you cross get in the smaller line and look for the small overhead sign that says ferry to the temple. You have to go through a turnstile after paying the fare first. Unfortunately the person who takes your 3 bhat may direct you to the larger public ferry nearby that many use to get back to there hotels or other places. You may have to persist to get on the proper smaller ferry. Otherwise you may take a longer ferry ride only on the east side of the river without the results you desire. A lot less crowds at this temple and we found the monks more engaging. From the nearby park you can watch the lights slowly advance up the temple as it gets dark. May have to wait until as late as 7PM to see the temple fully lighted. Awesome sight every with the scaffolding around it. Last ferry back leaves at 9 PM."

Hence it is one of the most captured on screen temple in Thailand . Most photographed. I went here the second time on Sunday and it was closed at 6pm. So we ended up sitting at the park across wat Pho waiting for sunset. You can watch slowly day turns into night , with beautiful reflection on the water of boats crossing and the lighting of the temple seem amazing it's how they built the temple it seems like the light starts to turn on from bottom to top. But if u look carefully they only place the lights on the one the few at the most bottom level but the sunset and how it's built made it lighten up from bottom to top. It's amazing. Heres some of the poor photos I took during my last trip. It won't help much but it will give you rough idea on how the place look like. Be sure to come earlier to at least go to Grand Palace first then walk to Wat Pho then spend ur time waiting for sunset "

We visited at the end of the day and it was still pretty busy.In the first room we were told that going under the King's old bed was good luck. So my 2 year old and I took the challenge of wiggling on our bellies under the bed. Bring on the luck!!The main temple is under repair, so there is scaffolding up on some of it. Still lots of photo opportunities though. As always covering shoulders and knees, for women, is a must, to be respectful."

            "review": "Bangkok - Beware of being cheated. We had an unpleasant experience during our trip. Retrospectively thinking, we should not have been so gullible....We were at Rama VIII road (near Khaosan) trying to head towards Wat Pho, when we were approached by a man claiming to be a teacher at a nearby school who mentioned that Wat Pho, Wat Arun and Grand Palace is closed until 3pm on that day since it was \"Special Buddha day\". He wrote down on a piece of paper list of five places that we should visit through a tuk tuk instead, namely Big Buddha, Wat Ben, Lucky Buddha and Export \u2013 having special promotion by Thailand Government. He added saying that tuk tuks will only charge 40 baht since gasoline was free on the occasion of Buddha day. He also told us that the Lucky Buddha temple is opened only once in the whole year on the occasion of Buddha day and we should miss the chance to visit the temple. We thanked him for the information and within a minute were approached by a tuk tuk who charged us exactly the same price for covering the 4 places. After visit the \u2018Big Buddha\u2019 temple, we were taken to the \u2018Lucky Buddha temple\u2019. Upon entering the \u2018Lucky Buddha\u2019 temple, we found all the temple doors to be shut so we went to look for another entrance and to confirm that the temple was closed for the day. In the meanwhile, while we were trying to find our way around the temple, we were approached by a respectable looking Thai man who shared that the temple was closed for the day and was open only in the morning. He started to speak to us about his new business in Australia and shared some stories of his work abroad. During this conversation, he spoke about the Thai export week and how he had gone the previous day with his wife and daughter to purchase sapphire jewellery at a low price. He mentioned that the jewellery is offered by the Thai government without any tax for only retail purposes through government controlled shops. He highly recommended that we visit the Thai export and reassured to us that only the best quality gems would be sold there. Post this, we got back into the Tuk Tuk who took us to Ban Thai Gems Co. Ltd. Saying that this is the government controlled shop for Thai Export. The shop is 3 floors high and looks very lavish in appearance. Looking at the variety and gems and seeming authenticity of the shop we decided to purchase a ring. We purchased a ruby ring worth 26,400 Baht. And were given all the certificate of guarantee and the receipt. We left the shop and got the tuk tuk driver to drop us off at MBK. At the end of the day, we realized that all the temples were open for the whole day and there was no such thing called Buddha day or a Lucky Buddha temple. We also very soon found out post some online search that there were no Thai government export promotions on gems or free gasoline on that day. Further, on checking the internet we found full details on similar scams associated with Ban Thai Gems and the Lucky Buddha scam. We suspect that the piece of jewellery sold to us is a fake. We reported to the police (Tourist Police near boxing stadium - Lt Winya Peter Thengnimitr - 0813422150) and also to the Indian Embassy, who were supportive. The police however, told us to negotiate a refund instead of filing a compliant since there was no hard core proof. Lt. Peter accompanied us to the shop. Since we had paid by credit card, we did manage to get a 100% refund.I would advice that as tourists, it is important to not not let the guard down, have access to GPS maps and not be bowled over by sweet talking polite strangers! Also I have noticed that the sweet talk soon changes to a stubborn refusal to understand \" English\" when the tables are turned against their favor - so take care!"

I would suggest to visit Wat Phra Kaew and the Grand Palace first thing early in the morning, then Wat Pho nearby and then Wat Arun across the river. The crossing costs peanuts. If you are tired after visiting the first two sights, have a break in the cozy, unassuming, air conditioned interiors of Gloria Jeans Coffees in Tha Thien Rd. close to the pier. Ice tea with milk there is just glorious. Or for a few bahts have a snack from the outdoor vendor-the real McCoy. At the pier crowds can be intimidating for the uninitiated but in spite of the hustle there will always be someone willing to help and direct you to the right boat that will ferry you across (2.5 Bahts per person one way). Wat Arun is yet another iconic treasure, that will take your breath away. Again, details can easily be found in any guidebook. Suffice it to say that one hour and a bit should be enough, maybe two if you are keen. Needless to say you have to behave and dress appropriately: cover your knees and shoulders, sarong being a good choice for women. The ticket costs mere 50 Bahts and crowds are negligible by comparison with say, Emerald Buddha."

Wat arun is amongst the top tourists attraction and hence we decided to visit..the decision proved to be insightful!This is a relatively huge temple and the exterior is much fascinating as it is made of intricate patterns out of colourful glass.. It was a bit scary to climb up the stairs to reach the higher levels of the temple as the Stairs were steep ..people with vertigo must avoid climbing .. Its a pleasant site amidst the chaos of the city life"

An easy ferry shuttle from Tha Tien across to west side of river leaves you in a mixture of pavilions, shrines, small gardens, vendors, and the huge center spire of Wat Arun. Great place to relax, spend an hour or two, and head back across when you're ready. Currently the main spire is scaffolded, and you cannot access the upper levels. But even the first level gives great vistas and first hand views of this incredible work."

Entry to the temple is 100 Baht (c.3 USD) and a visit can be done right after a visit to Wat Pho across the river. A boat zigzags between two riverbanks every few minutes, for less than 10 US Cents per person. The temple is made up of colorful spires, which have been decorated with pieces of colorful glass or porcelain pieces. Around the spires are various warrior figures with intricately crafted details. Be careful of the steep stairs in Wat Arun.

Wat Arun is nothing short of an architectural masterpiece.The main stupa glistens in the sun welcoming visitors on the bank of the Chao Phraya opposite the Tha Tien pier.Access is by a cross-river boat from the aforementioned pier (2.50 baht) which is usually full at most times.Once there, do take your time to take in the beauty of this Wat from all angles(not to mention photos!).It was undergoing restoration work at several places during the time of my visit but this did not diminish its beauty much. The main structure is a wonder in itself with alternating layers of marble and masonry in a circular structure being \"held up\" by a ring of Garudas at each level.We can just about make out a group of long-tusked elephants near the peak of the structure standing like guardians facing in (?2; correct me if I'm wrong) different directions.Be advised that there's a strict dress code as with any other Wat.

The decorations are special: a layer of plaster was laid over the brick structure which was decorated with bits of Chinese porcelain and ceramic tiles. The effect is dazzling, You can admire the structures from the ground or you can start climbing steep steps to get a bit higher (some parts are closed). There is lots to see, the attention to detail in the decoration is amazing. You can stroll about at your leisure, there are places to rest tired feet - and for somthing spectacular, watch he sun set over he temple from the other side of the river (there are a couple of restaurants which offer amazing views)."

On a warm sunny afternoon it provided a calm place for contemplation, iced coffee and shade . I took the local boat, did not go with a tour group, and did not get lost on the way. I was staying nearby so walked to the pier. Anyone can fairly easily get to the pier by BTS. The pier is a two minute walk from the BTS. Warning, the BTS is mostly unsuitable and inconvenient for those with limited mobility but taxis in BKK are cheap. The first boat takes you to the pier for Wat Pho. Then you pay a small amount again and quickly arrive pn another boat at Wat Arun. I visited it with my 84 yr old mother and we wete delighted to find several places to rest in the shade during the afternoon. An inexpensive, accessible, and tranquil experience. The expected Christmas holiday crowds did not appear that day. Another warning- we had fun dressing up in Thai traditional clothing but the man we paid 100 baht each to take our pictures was a terrible photographer and he uses your own photographic device.

The towers of Wat Arun are built of brick covered with stucco. The decorations are unique; thousands of pieces of multicolored Chinese porcelain. In niches in the central tower are green figures of the Indra God seated on Erawan, the traditional Thai three-headed elephant. Niches in the smaller towers contain figures of the Moon God or Phra Pai (god of wind), on a white horse. The multi prongs extend from the top of each tower."

Located on the West Bank of Chao Phya river and you could actually combine this temple to the same day trip to the grand palace, wat pho and other temples.Bring your hats and umbrellas along as the weather could be hot and humid.This temple features exquisite principle prang which has bits and pieces of ceramic stitched together.

It's unique! Nice to see in detail those ceramics especially which still has a complete shape like small plates. The quite bright color of the ceramics pieces made this temple shiny brightly comparing to common temples.Don't forget to climb to the top if you can to take pictures of Chao Phraya river & Bangkok as background.

The architecture is stunning and you can really walk anywhere in the small complex, touching the walls and the designs (which I rather feel we shouldn't do, to help preserve it). I wish we'd read up on the history of it or hired a guide as I think you'd get so much more out of it having that - but it was gorgeous to see and I'm glad we did it! An easy walk to the Grand Palace once you take the boat back over the river, so we headed there afterwards.

This temple is close to the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and The Royal Palace-- you just need to take a very cheap ferry (a few baht) across the river. It's worth it as it's not too expensive. We spent about 30 minutes or more on the grounds even though the upper parts were under construction. I do wish we would've seen the sunrise or set."

The number 1 bus takes you there, which you can catch from the Golden Buddha or Chinatown area. From the grand palace entrance you can walk approx. 15 mins to a pier where you can catch a boat directly to wat arun for a mere 2.50 baht. Rather than pay 40 baht one way at other piers. This boat is literally opposite wat arun. So be sure to keep walking up the road until you find the correct pier. Such a great cheap option. Directions from grand palace: turn left from outside of main entrance of grand palace, walk to end of the road and make another left, then keep walking until you get to the wat arun pier. Remember there are other piers along the way, where travel agents will try to get you to pay more hiring a boat etc. Just ask them where the wat arun pier is and they should point you in the right direction.Entrance into the wat arun as of 29th December 50 baht."

But because it's in the area of other attractions and because it costs mere pennies (when converted to USD) to go across the river to this temple, I would say it's worth a visit. There's a fee to get up close to the temple and climb the first level or so, but you can't go all the way up like you used to be able to do. Once you get up close to this temple and you see the intricate details adorning the outside of it, you'll understand why they're doing restoration work. It'll be beautiful when the restoration is completed. So if you won't be in Bangkok again, definitely visit Wat Arun. If you will be in Bangkok again in a few years after the restoration is complete, skip it for now because there are plenty of beautiful temples in Bangkok to amaze you. And of course, dress respectfully."

Wat Arun is currently under restoration, so I think it will be ideal if you just go there around that time as the lights won't be on at night during these times. Not so many people when I was there (partly because of restoration) but personally I like it with less people. Chao Praya at sunset was really beautiful and it felt really zen. If you're looking for inner peace maybe you can try going here and sit during sunset time. well worth my 50 Baht :>PS: Be sure to try some foods along the streets before boarding the boat.

There's major renovation works there in 2015/6 which restrict access. I was there 4 years ago before the renovations ad climbed the almost vertical stepped face of the temple, which in itself was a challenge, but amplified the style and nature of the temple.It's located barely 10-15 minutes away from the Grand Palace across the river.

This was the main Wat in days of yore (17th century) and stood on the grounds of the old Grand Palace. A new Grand Palace has since been built and stands across the river but Wat Arun is still one of the most significant sites visited by all in Thailand. Do take the river ferry ride up/down the Cho Praya river on a day pass as you can hop on and off indefinitely for the day. Enjoy the sights and sounds of Bangkok and don't forget to SHOP!!!"

There are vendors along the side of the grounds that sell food, water, clothes, and trinkets. But the day I was there the vendors were very rude. Maybe because there were no tourists, or that business was slow that day. So don't expect to see very many Thai smiles there. It can get very hot so ware a hot of some kind and stay hydrated."

From Wat Po you can take a ferry across the river to Wat Arun. I'm always surprised how many foreigners I meet in Bangkok who NEVER take a boat on the river. It's one of the easiest things to do in the city. I would have given Wat Arun 5 stars just for the views of the river and cityscape, but because of some refurbishing in parts of the temple, I can't right now. I took several photos of the temples and temple cats while in Thailand (including Wat Arun). If you're interested you can search for it. The slideshow is on youtube titled \"Morning Cat Temple\"."

Although still under construction (there are scaffoldings and the entrance to higher parts of main wats is closed) it is still a wonderful place to visit. The porcelain mesmerising decorations on wats are very unique. It is on the other side of the river so the number of tourist is smaller (in comparison with Wat Pho for instance) and you can really feel the atmosphere or a Thai temple. There are small bells on those buildings making your contemplation better and deeper. A bonus: even thoug under construction, the Wat is beautifully lit at night, a view especially worth observing from the other bank of the river."

Quite a contrast from Bangkok - its quiet, relatively traffic-free, and worth exploring the local laid-back community, numerous inexpensive Thai cafes, coffee shops and art shops.

            "review": "One night stand with Bangkok. What do you do when you have 1 day in Bangkok and want to make the most of it, how to come up with an itinerary that makes full use of the time. Not having the luxury of too many days leaves from work, me any friends planned a 5-6 days trip in Thailand, a perfect break! According to our itinerary we had 1 day in Bangkok! And trust me we made the full use of each minute! So here we go.. The Flight:We had booked an early morning flight, well early in the true sense. Kolkata, India to Bangkok flight, departing at 12:05 am. We had a Spicejet flight that cost us really cheap, but this was the worst flight experience in my life. To start with the seats were unusually cramped up. For a 5feet 4inch figure too it was extremely difficult to sit properly due to excessively less leg space. The flight somehow managed to have all the unruly passengers at once. There was a huge group of middle aged men who were the loudest and the most uncouth, lets blame the mid-life crisis for that. Anyways the flight was on time never the less. We arrived at 4:00 Bangkok time. The flight duration was 2 hours roughly. After a smooth Visa on Arrival process that roughly took us about an hour, we were all set to step out into Bangkok. The Taxi ride:The taxi service was pretty smooth, after having booked a pre-paid taxi we were utterly pleased to be directed towards a striking Pink Taxi. What more would be so pleasing for a bunch of girls at 5:00 in the morning, more than a hot pink taxi. That just set in the right mood. The roads were empty, clean and the sky a gloomy blue. The taxi driver was a pretty old man with wrinkles with a very warm smile. Yes he did not understand a word of English. So we have to wake our sleepy brains up to try and explain him where we needed to go. We had a hotel reservation near Khao San road. Unable to understand us and vice-versa we showed him the hotel reservation printout, although he was unable to read it. He did take help from a passerby to read him out the direction. He had lovely Thai music playing, we did not understand the language but it calmed and relaxed. Our first pic in Bangkok was one with the pink taxi taken by the driver!Morning in Khao San road:We arrived at the hotel which was perfectly place on the main road, no alleys or hassles to find out the hotel, since we had reached early at around 7:00 am. And the check in time being 12:00 pm, we had a lot of time to laze around until we got a room. So instead we munched on a few freebies kept in the waiting area, had some fresh coffee and headed out to explore what was around. The morning walk felt lovely, fresh air, empty roads, it was just the best start to a lovely day. We kept walking by closed shops, eateries and banks until we met a guy, whom we asked if there was any market place nearby. Fortunately we were a stones throw away from the famous Khao San road. We fastened our pace. And we knew we had reached Khao San the moment we could see restaurants with lazy tourists like us and colorful eateries, roadside stalls selling local food. The road sides were lined up with tables and chairs, with empty, some full with people busy enjoying there morning breakfast.We walked across the several restaurants admiring the various unique decors, names and themes that each place had. The entire stretch of the road somehow had a unique freshness and warm feeling to it, very welcoming and bright.We decided upon a unique place that caught our eye. It had a very welcoming living room type d\u00e9cor with super comfy sofas and waitresses dressed in pink, by now pink had already seemed to become the color of Bangkok. We ordered continental food but to our surprise it was lipsmackingly delicious. There were a couple of there tourists too who interacted with us, clicked pictures with us as well. Well the one think I loved about eating in Bangkok. You do not need to pay taxes J what a relief to be able to pay for exactly what you eat, also that almost all of these places offered free wifi. On our way we could not stop having a few tall glasses of freshly made fruit juice. By the time we were back in the hotel it was 11:00 am and were allowed an hour early check-in. Chao Phraya River ride:At the hotel we all took a quick one hour nap while the other was in the shower, that way we had our share of power nap while utilizing the time. We were ready in sometime and also set to explore the traditional side of Bangkok, also referred to as Old Bangkok. We asked the hotel receptionist for directions around old Bangkok, and they were really helpful to guide us with all necessary details and a map.And we took off, admiring the many shops on the way and after making our self a quick coffee and ready to eat noodles easily available in the departmental store. Within 10 minutes of walking we reached the Chao Phraya River side. The hotel guys were so helpful in advising us to not take a tuk-tuk (local 3 wheeler transport) which would cost us around 100-150 thai baht, and instead go via the quickest and cheapest transport, the ferry which hardly cost ur around 10 thai baht. Not only that the ferry ride is too beautiful. The river side if full of big fishes which is amusing to watch.Imagine yourself in a ferry and any direction you see there is heritage and tradition and the culture of the Bangkok. The ride itself seems like an attraction. One of the local guys helped us identify the ferry with a reddish orange flag as the one that would take us. Old Bangkok: Old Bangkok is mesmerizing with architecture that is intricate and colourful. Old Bangkok is house to most of the famous attractions like, the Grand Palace, the inspiring beauty of Wat Phra Kaew, the traditional learning centres Wat Pho and Wat Mahathat, the latter widely considered one of Thailand's first universities and a centre for meditation. Sanam Luang, a historic park next to the Grand Palace traditionally used for important Royal or Buddhist ceremonies, and the National Gallery. We deboarded from our ferry at the Grand Palace.Grand Palace is an epitome of wonderful thai architecture. Its intricate detailed work and maintenance is commendable. It still hosts important ceremonies today. After Grand Palace we headed to Wat Pho. Wat Pho or better known as the Temple of the Reclining Buddha is a must visit just to witness the magnitude and massiveness of the place. Please be aware that all these places have strict dressing rules, women are required to not wear short or revealing clothes. Although Wat Pho has the arrangement of a robe incase you are not dressed appropriately for the place. But yet it is advised to either carry a cover up change or clothes like we did as advised to us by the receptionist or be dressed in not revealing clothes. You are also required to take off your shoes before entering. What strikes the most about the place is the massiveness of the reclining Buddha. The figure is 15 metres tall, 46 metres long, so huge it would make you wonder how it even got inside the building. The Buddha's feet are 5 metres long and decorated in mother-of-pearl illustrations of auspicious 'laksanas' (characteristics) of the Buddha. 108 is a significant number, referring to the 108 positive actions and symbols that helped lead Buddha to perfection.* The rest if the area too is big enough and worth taking a walk through. There are many English speaking guides but I felt its better to gain knowledge about the place online than waste 200-400 TB unnecessarily.While these 2 attarctions were on one side of the river, the next place Wat Arun was on the opposite side of the river. We again took the cheapest and quickest way out to the other side of the river by the ferry at 3TB, it opposite to Wat Pho. Make sure to keep Wat Arun at the end of the list since it looks stunning during sun-set when it lights up. When we arrived it was still sunlight. Same dressing rules apply. Wat Arun is not only beautiful but adventurous too. The Temple has a unique structure and architecture. As you start climbing up the stairs of the temple the stairs start becoming steeper and steeper, and the stairs gets narrower. It does get scary at the heighest point, we did muster up the courage to climb up but trust me looking down the stairs was pretty scary. There is a railing to hold onto for sure, I would suggest don\u2019t miss the climb. BY the time we got down, it was just about sunset, as we made ourself comfortable on the lawn on the banks on river Chao Phraya, the temple lit up. It was so inspiring as symbolic to us to be present there to watch it light up against the setting sun. Khao San at night:After we were done soaking in so much tradition and beauty of Thai architecture and culture we knew it was time to enjoy the night-life. Since the ferry services last only till around 7:30 pm we had to make a quick chase to get back to Khao San via ferry, we were lucky to get onto the last ferry. The river ride is even more beautiful at night with the spires of the Thai architecture lit up all around. We go of and headed towards Khao San. Its transforms into a different place at night. Unlike morning it was bustling with energy and tourists of all kinds and places. The energy is infectious that it gets onto you. After an entire evening of walking and climbing we settled down for an obvious foot massage, very easily available at evry 10 minutes distance. Trust me the foot massage acted like an energy bar for me. As it it took away all the exhaustion. We set off to explore almost the entire stretch of Khao San, it has amazing clubs and eatries. We tried the local pad thai noodles and must say it was cooked to perfection. You can also find many vendors selling fired crickets, flies, scorpions, cockroach, but incase you are not a fan of fried insects you can click a picture of them or with them for 5-10 THB. Now that\u2019s business! You can see restaurants, bars, clubs of all sizes, colors and styles, and most of them seem pretty inviting with great continental or local thai cuisine. Indian food is usually expensive there. For shopping I would suggest this is not the best place as its on the more expensive side. Shopping for souviniers is easy though as bargaining is possible. With this we ended our one day in Bangkok, we made the most of it and loved every bit of it."

            "review": "One of the three ABSOLUTELY must-go-to (in my opinion) temples in Bangkok. There are three temples in Bangkok (among LITERALLY like a hundred of them) that, in my opinion, every tourist should get to, and they are Wat Saket (Golden Mount), Wat Arun & Wat Pho, and the good thing is that Wat Arun and Wat Pho are in a close proximity to one another (just across the Chao Phraya River from each other), so the two can be done one after the other in just one morning or afternoon.This temple is essentially consisting of a tall main prang surrounded on each of the four corners by a shorter prang, and the faces of the prangs if you look closely are mosaics of colorful ceramic or glass pieces, and so it's indeed quite amazing if you think of how much time of manual labor must have required for such an assemblage on these five giant prangs! The main prang can be gone up to about halfway along its vertical length (the last set of stairs needs a bit of caution as the steps get smaller compared to the ones near the bottom). But the going up is totally worth it with spectacular views from up there such as those of the Chao Phraya River, the city and the roofs of the Grand Palace a little upriver.Also, don't overlook the little temple past the market area that you'll see once you get off the cross-river boat (go straight through the market area to get to that temple). It's like an open pavilion with four covered corridors around it, and inside each corridor is a line-up of Buddha statues with some interesting statues (probably Chinese-influenced statues) outside in front of the corridors. The market area outside that little temple has all kinds of food, so there's no need to rush back across the river for food after an arduous climb up the main prang and coming back down because the food is readily available on the temple grounds :).The best way to get here, in my opinion, is by boat on the Chao Phraya River which will also give you a chance to enjoy the views along the river banks and of the river itself with floating vegetations and such. Take an orange-flag boat from Saphan Taksin Pier (the central pier) and get off at the No. 8 Pier (Tien Pier) after about 15 to 20 minutes which costs like 15 baht, then take the cross-river boat for a mere 3 baht which will bring you in just about five minutes to the pier beside the temple on the other side of the river from Pier 8. The temple's admission was quite reasonable at like 50 baht that I paid as a foreigner. One more thing about Pier 8 (either before taking the cross-river boat to the temple or after coming back from it and before going back down river to the Saphan Taksin central pier) is that it is great for small souvenir shopping with postcards available for like 10 or maybe even 5 baht each, so be sure to check out those gift shops at the pier (No. 8) either before or after your visit to the temple although there are also similar shops on the temple grounds on that side of the river as well."

Could see a lot of boats in the river next where even tourist boats were seen. A moderate entry fee of 50THB is charged. What impressed me moe was the advise everywhere not to use the revered Budha as a show piece by buying and displaying his statues. There are also small shops where curios and some ready made dress like T shirts, girls tops etc can be purchased. It is a must-see place for any visitor to Bangkok.Rtn.J.Ganesh"

First time I went there in 2002, once again, as most of things that I have seen and experienced in Thailand, Wat Arun has left deep imprint in my soul, so I just had to go back recently. Took my boyfriend with me. The best way to get there if you're in central Bangkok is to go to Taksin pier by sky train. At the pier, if you're planning to visit more attractions on both sides of the river, I advice to buy a day boat pass which costs from 150 to 300 baht. Once again, that's if you plan getting on and off many boats that day. If not, once you get on the boat going to Wat Arun, you will only need to pay a very small fee of 30 baht. This particular boat will keep stopping at different stops on the east side of the river. Once you reached Wat Arun, a small boat ferry will take you to the west side of the river where Wat Arun is. The place is amazing, architecture and religious art stunning, almost out of this world. Even though it is not very ancient, it certainly feels very ancient. You can walk around this unbelievable structure, can even climb it as there are stairs, mind you, very steep and high stairs. You can only climb half the structure as stairs end, but that is already high enough to see the surrounding areas, the river, miles and miles of Bangkok. Once again, you can get blessings from Buddhist monks. For cat lovers like myself, there are many temple cats just lying around, or following you and making whole experience more fun. Before going through the gates women will be given shawls to cover shoulders if exposed. A shawl is given, you have to leave 100 baht deposit which you get back after returning your shawl. Hope you all enjoy your experience at Wat Arun as much as I did it twice in my life. Almost forgot to mention souvenir shops there"

The best time (as the name suggests) to visit is at dawn. Except for once, I have never gone inside the Wat or the temple outside. However, the location is such that one doesn't have to go inside the Wat to experience its glory. The imposing structure as your boat approaches the Tha Tien pier is in itself an alluring factor. On Saturday mornings, the building next door to the Wat houses a school for young Thais to learn Buddhist chants. The melodious sounds of the chants will leave you at peace on Saturday mornings."

You can have your long tail boat take you to the dock and pick you up afterwards.This temple complex is smaller than most and therefore easier to navigate. Climbing to the top is a fun activity and offers a lovely view. It is a temple so be sure to dress appropriately (covered shoulders and knees). This temple is much less crowded than the Temple of the Emerald Buddha or Wat Po."

However the stairs to climb the temple are extremely narrow and extremely tall. Each stair was half the width of my foot, and the next step up would be above my knee. Luckily there are ropes to hold on to. But be prepared!Also good to note, this is a temple, and temple dress codes apply. (well to women anyway). Even if I don't agree with such things, I like to be respectful. And in temples in Thailand this means longer pants/skirts and covered shoulders."

The temple is very old, the colour on the wall is fading.

There is a prayer temple in the campus with big Buddha statue and an area where one can offer oil to the lamps. There is a Ganesha status and navagraha statues in the campus along with a laughing Buddha statues for offering prayers. There is a coffee shop outside which serves good shakes, thai tea etc. If you are visiting place by taxi or tuk-tuk, negotiate with them in advance and tell them not to take you to gems museums on the way (takes a lot of time otherwise)."

The best way to get to the temple is by boat since the city side entrance is in a narrow street.The temple itself comprises a very central spire surrounded by several smaller spires. There are very steep stairs to climb up the central spire which is worth the effort since the views over the river are spectacular.The riverside entrance to the temple is through an ornate gateway guarded by some chinese statues with some souvenir shops to one side. The temple and the spire are built of several levels each slightly smaller than the previous one giving a pyramidal appearance to the structure. Each level is richly decorated with floral motifs and there are mythical figures holding up the temple. The platform below the spire has rabbeted edges and statues on the four sides. The spire itself is almost vertical and very tall.When I visited, renovation works were in progress in the temple which offered a rare glimpse into the way the temple is decorated. The temple itself is painted a blinding white color. However it is so densely covered in decorative motifs, one things it is multicolored. The motifs itself are not painted but are made of colored porcelain pieces glued to the walls. There must be thousands if not millions of these pieces covering the walls of the temple which is a testament to the effort spent in decorating the temple.It is said the best views of the temple are at sunset from across the river. Unfortunately I could not stay for that. The temple is also lit up at night and looks beautiful from aboard a dinner cruise on the river.A must see if you are visiting Bangkok."

One side of it has been completed so you can take some cool pictures, but it will be a lot better once the scaffolds are removed."

For those who want to make Wat Arun as their destination during day trip should know this even though no movement as closed , but look like you won't get a scenery you expect and want to head to Wat Pho or somewhere else FYI."

If you're lucky, you can still find a taxi driver that will take you there from the center of Bangkok. The 50 baht entry fee was a bit off-putting and surprising, considering it used to be free to enter and walk around the grounds...times are different. Gone are the guys holding pythons for visitors to take pictures with (at least on the day we visited), and a portion of the grounds is full of tourist trinkets. Despite this, the temple itself, although under reconstruction/refurbishment, is still an impressive sight. Visitors can walk around the temple grounds and take photos of many beautiful things. The neighborhoods across the street are worth visiting as well if you want to walk through and get a sense of life in Tonburi."

Although it is under renovation until 2016, I didn't think it detracted much from my visit. There's a nice little market surrounding the exterior of the temple. Although Wat Arun is the Temple of the Dawn, it was definitely made to be seen at night.

Wat Arun is a beautiful landmark structure that is visible from far away along the Chao Phraya River, especially at night when it is lit in vivid golden hues. (Indeed, the best way to get to it is by boat.) When the temple and grounds are open during the day, the view back towards the east bank from the from the riverside landing is impressive as is the view from the boat back and forth as it looms larger or recedes into the scene depending on which direction you're headed. My friends who had climbed on up to the top level on their previous visits to the wat before renovation construction blocked about 3/4 of the facade including the steep and narrow stairs past the first level, say that the view from the higher vantage is even more exciting.The wat is not only an imposing and impressive architectural attraction, but is also an active center of worship, and appropriate clothing is required for all who would enter. Tip -- even though it gets rather hot in Bangkok during the day, wearing long pants and sleeved shirts will make it easier to come and go from various attractions including the Grand Palace as well as the wats in the area without having to rent \"cover up\" clothes at each location.Well worth the visit and worth allowing some time to look around even though much of it is covered up, rather than just taking a selfie and hopping on the next boat back."

They changed the name from Wat Jang to Wat Arun in the later years. You will be amaze with the original Thai' architecture on the golden stupa specialy at night time. The light is so great and made the stupa stand out from bangkok sky line, you can see it from the far distance.

It is literally on the opposite side. You can see straightaway it's under renovation so don't expect beautiful photos from afar. If memory serves me well it was 3 baht for a return trip. Once there it's 50 baht. Was a nice visit but the not the most impressive place I visited in Bangkok. I did however love the opportunity to dress up in traditional thai clothes. They'll dress you up and take photos for 100 baht. Overall, go if you have time but I wouldn't recommend it if you have only 1-3 days in Bangkok."

Be forewarned that if you are walking there from across the river, it's best to do it on an overcast day (if you can), and if you are going to take a short cut rather than following the river, be careful because it will take you through some poor local neighbourhoods. Just be careful and stow away your cameras and gadgets.On the river side of the temple, there is a small area with street food and vendors.

We were actually in Bangkok again in March and they have seemed to put up even more scaffolding which is a shame for anyone visiting it. The stairs are also very steep so if you have mobility problems it is probably not a very good idea to climb up to the top level although it is still just as a pretty from the bottom.

However, it is still an awesome spectacle. Wat Arun \u2013 the Temple of Dawn is 79 m high and towers above the Chao Phraya river. At the entrance one is greeted by two mythical giants which lead one through to the temple which is beautifully decorated with ceramic tiles and colourful fragments of porcelain ie broken cups bowls and plates some of which were donated by the locals. The main tower is surrounded by four smaller towers with statues of the God of Wind \u2013 Phra Phai. It is possible to climb part of the temple for amazing views across the river to the Grand Palace and beyond but the steep and narrow steps are not for the faint hearted. Be aware that the higher levels are currently closed as a result of the on-going building works. This is disappointing but the temple is still very much worth the visit.Situated on the more inaccessible bank of the river the temple is relatively easy to get to if one knows the route. Simply take a water taxi to Tha Tien Pier (near Wat Pho) and cross the river using the boats cross the river. Do not confuse the boats that serve only to cross the river with the tourist boats that run along the whole length of the Chao Phraya. Accessing the river from central Bangkok is easiest via the Saphan Taksin station on the Skytrain. A short walk brings you to Pier O (CEN) where one can catch a tourist boat up stream to Pier 8 and cross the river using the river taxi. The temple is open from 8.30 to 17.30 each day and costs 50 THB (about \u00a31GBP) for tourists and is free for locals."

The upper echelons are very steep. Easier to get up than down. Latter I did backwards, to avoid mishaps. Take your time to admire the many mosaics. All different. We were told they were made by ceramic bits and pieces, discarded by the many Chinese ships coming to port. Seen by night it's even more mysterious. A must visit!"

By making the boat trip across the Chao Phraya river to the temple grounds, making offerings of gift and prayer, as well as ascending the steps to the dizzying heights of the temple, one creates merit which influences our karmic profile, and enhances our being.I promise that you will feel this way after a visit to this amazing location! :)"

The Temple of Dawn ( Wat Arun ) is a large beautiful Buddhist Temple that is located on the West Bank of the Chao Phraya River. However, Wat Arun, is named after the Hindu god Arun. The tall and unique central Khmer tower with lots of spires is surrounded by 4 smaller towers decorated with sea shells and broken pieces of porcelain. At the base of the smaller towers there are many demons and monkeys. When entering the pavilion there are two giant figures (demons ? ) guarding the gate. As this is a popular site you need to be sure to have tennis shoes on not flip flops, plenty of water, and to be sure to put your money and credit cards in a pouch under your shirt or blouse as it gets very crowded. The large crowds is a perfect place for pick pockets to apply their trade. In order to avoid the rush and pushing of the large tourist groups, it is also suggested to let the crowds go by and then you can enjoy the site and take good pictures. If you arrive early you can also avoid the crowds. There is a commuter boat that travels along the river and you can take great photos from the river. There is also a dinner cruise that affords you the opportunity to take great evening photos. There is so much to see and enjoy at Wat Arun and it is a Must see when visiting Bangkok. A day visit and an evening boat ride when it is lit up is well worth your time."

You can still pay 50 baht to get in, but you cannot actually climb anything or see much. Renovations began February 11th. Until they are complete, you would be much better off going to any of a number of other Wats. If you haven't ever been to Wat Sukhat and the Giant Swing, go there. If you haven't been to Wat Saket in over a year, go there. Whether you've been to Wat Arum before or not, if you go there now you will be terribly disappointed. The small minor buildings to the west of the main chedis are interesting, but do not justify any effort to get there. The promenade in front of Wat Arun, where you can contemplate the river traffic, with your back to the Wat, is still wonderful. But with so many exquisite alternatives, why waste time on this one? Don't get me wrong, Wat Arun is awesome and I am delighted that they are doing this work. Get there as fast as ever you can, once the scaffolding comes down.

However currently there are maintenance works going to so we could not go up to the top. We only saw the surroundings and the grounds areas.

Thus, it is better to spend more money having evening drinks from restaurants across the river and enjoy the Temple basking in the lamplight"

Overall it's best seen from a distance as the external 'Kitsch' type detail is of poor quality anyhow.

Getting here by ferry, from Wat Pho, is the easiest and cheapest way to visit this amazing temple. One of the main things to do there is climbing the extremely steep stairs, which can be a big obstacle for some people but the view from the top is spectacular. Although the temple was under maintenance, the views were still worth seeing. Climbing down can be quite difficult but after a few tries, it is easy to go back down."

We told the driver that we dont want a tour we just want a boat ride but then he brought us to the wat arun tour that costs 800 baht per person. We declined and decided to just use the google map to find our way to wat arun. Just look for tha tien pier. The roundtrip boat ride costs 6 baht per person only and it only takes about 5-10 minutes to cross the river. The long walks finding the pier was all worth it. The view was magnificient. We wanted to wait for the sun to fully set but the guard whistled and instructed everyone to go down because the temple closes at 6pm. Aside from the expensive tour offered around at wat arun you have to be careful of the steep stairs."

Pay like 15 thb for a boat ride from sathorn pier to Wat Arun. I definitely recommend an evening hour as it offers an amazing sunset view. Don't go too late either cus it closes around 5pm. Many tourists make such a hype about Grand Palace and Emerald Buddha, but Wat Arun, standing tall on the opposite side of the river will wow you with its magnificent ancient architectures and beautiful ornaments decorated all over the temple.

Out of the 5 buildings at the temple, 4 of them were covered head to toe in scaffolding and therefore you couldn't actually get to the interesting bits. The one staircase that was open was VERY steep and was not only used to go up and down but also for Chinese tourists to stop and take pictures on. Unfortunately I didn't feel safe. The temples itself looked good up close with plenty of Buddhas and gods dotted around. The monks roaming around looked happy and you can pay to pray too if you fancy it.

At the moment (I stayed there in the beginning of February) the smaller Pagodas are all beeing renovated, which is definitely a good thing as practically all the ornaments have started to mould away - but not so nice to look at. In the middle of the Wat stands the biggest Pagoda, which you can climb if you`re fit and not afraid of height. It`s nice up there to look at Wat Po and the River, but for me this sight definitely wasn`t worth the climb. The steps are murderously steep at some points - I`m 28 and quite fit, but getting down that thing wasn`t really easy. So defininitely no sight for kids or older people! If you have to skip one of the three \"must do\"-Wats in Bangkok, it`s definitely Wat Arun!"

            "review": "Stunning view at night, rich in history, not much english. Wat Arun is just opposite the river from Wat Pho, which is located on the Bangkok side. War Arun is one of Bangkok's oldest temples, having been built before the Rattanakosin Era (The era of Thailand's Rama Kings). The temple and the surrounding area itself has undergone reconstruction quite a few times since it had been built, and was once the royal temple to the former King of Thailand. The temple draws influences from both Hinduism and Buddhism, while the surrounding area is slightly influenced by China. The Chinese statues present were said to have been used to balance boats that were coming in from China to trade, as the Chao Phraya river was once an extremely important trade route in Thailand's history. The temple itself is beautiful and was built upon the idea of Buddhism cosmology, a difficult concept to understand, but simply shows a hierarchy in life/death amongst different beings. It also depicts the buddhism/hindu belief in reincarnation. The downside to Wat Arun is that there is very little English, let alone signs to help guide you through the rich history of the place. There are absolutely no guides and as a visiting Thai, I would have had a lot of trouble if I had not previously done my research. I would expect foreigners to be able to appreciate the architecture of the temple but possibly not learn much of its history and significance at the site itself. What Arun has recently been very famous as a viewpoint/destination of sightseeing, but from across the river. At night, there are many restaurants (such as \"The Deck\") and hotels across the river on the Bangkok side which offer you amazing view of a beautifully lit up temple at night, the only one I've seen of its kind. To get To Wat Arun, it would be wise to take the cheap ferry close to Wat Pho, across the river form the Bangkok side. Taking a taxi across the river and trying to enter may take long and lead to other problems as well as it not being easy to enter from the road. All in all, Wat Arun is significant of life in the early Rattanakosin Era, being on the river, and is also the reason for King Taksin to move the capital from ancient Ayuthaya to Thonburi after war with the Burmese."

The design of the temple is very intricate but be warned the stairs are very steep once you get to the top! There are hand rails but once you are at the top it's so steep you have to climb back down backwards. Well worth the visit but if you have a fear of heights you might just observe from below."

The steps are really steep so you need pretty good mobility to get up and down them but well worth it for the view.The Wat is also surrounded by nice gardens and statues of Chinese guards.

Don't take a Tuk Tuk from either, but walk through to the river where there is a local ferry that goes back and to over the river for around 3Thb each way per person. There is a lovely little eating place hanging over the river there too. When you get off the ferry it's to your left, but you shouldn't miss it !! There are a lot of Thai Navy personnel around as the naval College is to the right. It's cheap to go in - about 50Thb and you can clamber as high as you dare up the temple. It's not easy and not for the faint hearted ! More on the way down than up. Great views over to the Grand Palace once at the top - and my 71 year old Mum made it to the top whilst my Dad sat at the bottom. The detail in the walls is amazing and no doubt tells a story. I love the guards too. This is on of the Temple's i never tire of at all and i think i've been to it on every journey. (I pretty much go 2 x a year)."

The towers or prangs, how they are called, (main and 4 smaller) are decorated with Chinese porcelain and coloured glass. Along the base of the main tower there are statues of Chinese soldiers and animals. There we were told that the central tower represents Mount Meru, the home of the Gods, and the 4 smaller towers are the 4 winds. On each of the smaller ones there is a statue of Pai, the God of winds, on his horse. At the base of the main tower, between each two small towers, there are images of Buddha showing the stages of his life - birth, meditation, preaching and enlightenment. In the ordination hall there is a golden image of Buddha and interesting murals.The stairs to the next levels are very steep and if the climbing up is difficult, the going down is really scary. After the exhausting climbing you can relax in the gardens surrounding the temple and you can see some other smaller structures. On the way out of the complex you will have to pass through a small market with souvenir stalls which is not the cheapest you can find in Bangkok!We went to Wat Arun after visiting Wat Pho on the other bank of Chao Phraya River. Then we walked some 300 meters to Tha Tien Pier and took the cross-river boat to Wat Arun (the boat is only 3 baht per person!).The fee is 50 baht and it is open daily from 8 AM till 5:30 PM."

The river trip is not amazing but it's certaily more interesting and less stressing than coming by taxi. I found this temples here to be smaller and less impressive in size but much more local and interesting than the other famous sights. I saw monks, people praying and meditating and plus you got to have less tourists to \"compete\" with while walking around. Entrance fee to part of the place is 50 tbh but there is a lot of temples you get in for free in the same area. It's worth to take a look."

This boat was only 3THB per person each way, so great value. Wat Arun is very ornate & while we were visiting, there was some renovation work taking place next to the main building which meant that scaffolding was present.I'd read previous reviews advising on the steepness of the steps leading up Wat Arun, I wasn't prepared for the reality. I was, however, determined to go as far up as I could manage. The first set are not only steep but are also narrow in depth. As well as this, there are no handrails: I therefore just looked down & took one step at a time & it wasn't long before I was on the next level. If you want to go up further, the steps seemed the same as before in steepness & depth, however not very wide, which meant that people could be going up & coming down at the same time in a fairly tight space. These steps had a handrail either side. I decided to take a deep breath & go up to the next level. This I did, again taking one step at a time. I'm glad I did so for the views, but decided that I wouldn't go any further as I now had to get down! Again one step at a time with my head down. When it came to the last set of steps without a handrail, I found it helped to walk down at the sides rather than the middle, giving some reassurance should I need to hold on to something solid!As well as the main attraction, there are also other areas to explore as well as places to purchase food. There are rest rooms, however it would be advisable to take your own tissues!"

We climbed the temple steps which were quite steep but it was well worth the sweat. Additionally, men and women alike are able to dress up in Thai traditional wear which I rented for 100 baht and take photos.

Unlike the sites on the other side of the river, you can climb the main structure of Wat Arun. The stairs are quite steep, but the view from the top is well worth the trip up! Although a portion of this wat is being reconstructed, there are several other buildings in the temple area that are worth checking out too. A great Bangkok landmark!"

We then took another boat across (only 3 bahts) from the same Pier. Wat Arun feels like it's on an island by itself (even though it's not) since you see green gardens and no car noises for once! Entrance to the temple is only 50 bahts per person.I always thought Wat Arun was made with some kind of prehistoric stone (sorry for the lack of knowledge) but it's actually white, decorated with blue and green and many other color porcelain. it's currently in renovation and we saw a restaurated part already which was stunningly white. As for the climb, this thing is steep. OMG especially the 2nd part is something to come down. Our only advice is to grab the handway well and don't look down. Look instead at the inner corner of each stair. We have been in Bangkok since 5 days now and this \"attraction\" was our favorite. The climbing, the beautiful setting and the quiet surroundings were such a treat. Do try it, you will always remember."

The main temple is relatively high and a wonderful view of Banhkok can be enjoy by those who climb it; however it should be noted that the stairs to the top are very steep and not for the faint hearted.Getting to Wat Arun was our biggest issue. We caught a ferry from the Centre Pier to Pier 8. To catch this ferry you wait until one arrives and buy a ticket (40 baht) on board. You do not need to get a longtail boat to get to Wat Arun. Next to Pier 8 is another ferry which takes you to the side of the river which Wat Arun is on (very cheaper, only 3 baht). It also cost 50 baht to get into the complex."

Make sure you spend at least 1.5-2 hours to visit everything since its a very complete complex where you can meditate, pray, think, relax or just taking pictures.At the top of the temple, the view of the river is eye opening.For ladies, make sure you cover your arms since this is a Buddhist temple."

TO GO:You can visit this place by taxi/tuk tuk or any other form of land transport.If you are coming by BTS, you need to stop at BTS Sanphan Takhsin, then take Exit 2 to the Central Pier. You will see a ticket booth selling tourist boat/express boat ticket. One way is TBH40/pax. Queue and wait for the call, the operators there will tell you when the boat arrives, just hold you ticket to let them see the colour type as there are day tours there as well.On the boat, a tour guide will explain to you briefly about the buildings at both sides of the river banks. To go to Wat Arun or Wat Pho, drop off at Pier 8 - Tha Tian Pier. You can choose to either visit Wat Pho first or go straight to Wat Arun via the cross river ferry. You need to pay another TBH3/pax per way to cross the opposite side.AT WAT ARUN:Foreigners are charged TBH50/pax. The locals call it the Number One Temple. You are allowed to climb up the stairs to reach the top (almost) of temple. There are two levels, one at the middle, another at almost the top. On top, you will be able to get a 360' view of the Chao Praya river and the surrounding area. Take your time to take some photos and be careful when climbing down the narrow and steep stairs. Do pay attention on the UP and DOWN sign and some people just ignored and caused congestion. BEST TIME:Go before evening for a good sunny view and stay until the lights are on for a nightshot.P.S. the temple is undergoing restoration at the moment (jan 2015) unfortunately but it is still opened to public. Metal racks for restoration are seen here and there, which is bad for photo. But the experience remains."

The temple itself is definitely worth a visit, the sculpturing and detailing is amazing. The steps ARE very steep but the handrails help (especially on the way down)! The view on top is definitely worth the climb. There is construction work going on at the moment so some parts are closed and there is some scaffolding on the surrounding temples but it doesn't distract from its beauty.One thing I also recommend is to see Wat Arun on a cruise along the Chao Phraya river as it gives you a very picturesque view of the whole temple."

Express boat goes there for just 20baht, that\u2019s about .63 cents to you and me. It should be a first stop for any first timers to the city. The views after the climb are miraculous. The climb itself is supposed to mirror the struggles of the human condition, of life, so yes they are staggeringly steep and difficult but worth every step. I arrived around 5pm not knowing if they would still be open. According to the sign on their property they are actually open until 6 so I had just enough time to see everything. A quick praise to TA, I would have never known that Wat Arun would have traditional Thai costumes that you can rent, on the cheap. It was only after browsing all the pretty photos I came across a few with the costumes and thought this is something I would LOVE to do. As a helpful hint, like everything in Thailand, the costume rental is negotiable so feel free to haggle a little, especially at the end of the day.As I am not a fan of one price for Thai, another price for everyone else. I will mention that it is free if you are Thai, everyone else must purchase a ticket for 50baht. For lack of better words I will just say it; this pricing scale is racist and I find any business in Thailand or anywhere else who decides to charge people extra based on the color of their skin is personally offensive. That said, the small ticket price does not take much away from the beautiful experience."

With fabulous views of the rising and setting sun and of the city's main attractions, the temple is one of Bangkok's most visited sights after the Grand Palace.Named by Bangkok's founder King Thaksin to signify the rise of the new kingdom (after Ayutthaya was destroyed), the Temple of the Dawn was originally much shorter until its expansion during King Rama III's rule (1824 - 1851). Local people donated the ceramic pieces that make up the temple's unique exterior decoration. It is possible to climb the temple for views across the river to the Grand Palace and beyond but its narrow steps are not for the faint hearted or if you have a problem with heights.Lots of stray dogs around,but do be careful,not to feed them,or cuddle I was told by my guide. Comfortable shoes and a hat is a must!"

After seeing that you were able to climb up the steps of this temple, I made sure that I would make myself do it. The first set of steps are more reasonable to climb up, however, if you are afraid of heights I suggest you stop here.I decided to push myself and climb up except I wasn't climbing up them, I was crawling. The steps are so steep that I didn't even feel safe crawling up them. I was absolutely petrified. After getting to the top, I wasn't bothered looking at the view as I was more concerned about finding a way to come down. The only safety barrier in place for the steps is a hand rail and that is it. Going down was even worse, if you make one wrong step or slip, you would have a serious accident so if you do decide to climb up further, I suggest that you take care and take your time. After saying that, I would totally recommend it though. Even though I was petrified, afterwards, I was so glad I did it and I knew that I would have regretted it if I didn't."

The steps to climb up are pretty narrow, and might scare you at once. But its definitely worth going for the amazing view and so witness the grand scale of the temple. The best time to visit the temple is just before the sunset. By doing this you can climb up the temple to two floors as well see the temple in the evening when it is lit. To capture this, the best option I think is to sit across the Chao Phraya river in one of the riverside restaurants, Amorosa being one of them where I went.This place expects tourists to be dressed appropriately. So its better to carry a sarong to cover your knees else, they rent out sarongs to cover urself at a minimal price of 20 Baht"

But the hard part is really getting down, especially if you are with young kids. Two of ours (6yrs, 4yrs) thought it was a cool adventure, but I know my heart missed a few heart beats in the process..Also, though the view up there is breath taking, the kids can hardly see anything due to the wall. So if you are with young kids, consider taking turns with your partner, so the kids don't necessarily go all the way up."

We bought tickets to climb the exterior walls for 20baht each. The stairs are very steep but the views are well worth it. There is a dress code that is enforced. Females should cover their shoulders. Sandles and heels are definatly not reccomended to climb the exterior. It was very crowded but that was expected. You can see this temple from across the river while it stands out from the others.

The temple is very beautiful especially when you see from the river side. There are quite numbers of cruising and restaurant on the opposite side that you can find with the Wat's view. I might recommend the restaurant which is opposite to Wat Po named the deck which have very nice scenery of Wat Arun especially at night."

What is interesting that every bit of detail to the temple is actually hand painted- we know this as we saw them doing it! The stairs are very steep so do be careful but you get some lovely pictures whilst at the top. There are stunning gardens around this temple. If you weren't already aware- do wear trousers and something that covers your shoulders. We forgot this but it wasn't a problem as there are vendors close by that will sell these items at a reasonable price. On the sunday that we were visiting there was actually a parade and it was fascinating to see all of the Monks dressed so differently. We didn't know about this so it was rather a surprise and delight!"

A visit to Bangkok will lead you surely to at least 4 temples - and you should enjoy each and everyone of them through their own perspective. Wat Arun don't have an impressive statue of Budah, or the richness associated with gold. It is a different style (Khmer), and the main material used in that temple is porcelain - broken pieces of China that were taken from the ships in the Thailand's commercial route. The interesting to do is to find out how those people transformed what was supposed to be garbage, in a decoration material. In Wat Arun, you can climb 3 distinct levels of stairs. If you do so, you can not only admire the city from the high, but see details of the temple that you cannot perceive from the ground. It is totally worthy. Note that each level of the stairs will have higher and smaller steps. So, just like our path to reaches the Nirvana, each phase will be harder...Be wise. If you're afraid of high, don't' climb. If you're a woman in a long skirt (this is possible, because you're visiting a temple in Thailand and that kind of modesty is required, be cautious in your way down. If climbing the three levels seam too much for you, try two of them... It will still be worthy."

The easiest way is by crossing the Chao Phraya river from the pier near Wat Pho. It will cost 3 baht per person one way. There is no fee to roam about around the temple grounds but you will have to pay 50 baht per person to get near the pagoda, but this is definitely worth the money. Thereon, you will get to see closely the ceramic tile pieces that have been used to decorate the pagoda. Climbing the steep steps to the top will give you a breathtaking view of the two sides of the Chao Phraya. Since we had time, we crossed the ferry back and spent some time in the park adjacent to the pier. Since it was Christmas time the park was also lit up with lights and was a definite photo stop. We stayed there till dusk and the lights on Wat Arun was truly impressive. A definite must visit."

No matter, it cost us next to nothing and like previously mentioned, added to the experience. Wat Arun was located a 15 minute walk or so from there. It is a very beautiful temple made up of layers of porcelain. Although it hasn't been confirmed, it is estimated to be between 67m - 87m tall and from the top you can get some stunning views of Bangkok. Taking the stairs back down again is scary as they're very steep but the view is totally worth it. This temple was one of my favourites in Bangkok and I 100% recommend a visit."

It's especially famous for the night time lighting, however it's totally worth visiting during the day. To get there you have to take a 3 Baht ferry from the pier next to Wat Poh. It takes just a couple minutes. The territori of the complex has several buildings, as usual, but the heart of it is the temple itself. It's not the kind of temple you enter, it's a kind of temple you climb!There are several staircases (on the sides of the temple leading to the middle level. And they are already tough ones. Stairs are high and kind of narrow, so you need to be very careful and it's a workout in itself. The middle level opens a nice view. Besides, the decoration of the temple is very interesting. The exterior is decorated with small colored mosaic-like pieces which compose an ornament. You can see women on the territory of the temple shaping and painting them. When you are on a middle level you have two options - down or further up. The top level opens a great view. BUT! The stairs become narrower AND higher. You can hold on the rail wrapped around with rope, still the exercise is a bit scary. Especially when getting down, the stair cases are put at a very acute angle and are nearly vertical, so think of getting down before going up. The temple is not as crowded as Emerald Buddha or War Poh and very unique. I loved it."

Wat Arun is easily accessible by taking a public express boat (not the overcharged tourist boats) which makes for an enjoyable experience in itself. We took the BTS to Saphan Taksin and then a boat from Sathorn Pier up the river. Visiting Wat Arun for a small fee gains access to the grounds around the temple and to climb the temple itself. Climbing the \"stairs of doom\" is frightening, but exciting, and the view of Bangkok / Chao Phraya river is (probably) worth the risk. But I warn you that these stairs are extremely steep and narrow in depth, so be careful!"

Remember u'l be climbing steep stairs as well. There is a entrance fee 500 baht then a u can take ur time exploring the place. Its true in the reviews here that the view is spectacular so no regrets. Went there 1st week of December and they were restoring the temple, repainting it so there were nets which was an unlikely site especially when taking photos. But I was able to get my way around it.

It is currently under some heavy renovation, 2 of the 4 side towers and the whole backside of the temple is surrounded by scaffolding, kind of a bummer but it shouldn't stop you from visiting if you are in bangkok. The stairs are steep but once you get to the top, you'll have a great view of the chao phraya river and the bangkok skyline in the distance. Take the sky train to BTS Saphan Taksin station at the edge of the river. Walk to the central pier where you can catch the ferries. Most tourists will buy the tickets to the tourist boat. 40 thb one way or 150 thb for an all day ticket. If you are savvy you can catch the local shuttle boats with the orange or yellow flag, one way should be 13 or 18 thb. Take any ferry to stop N8 Ta Tian. You can check out Wat Pho on the same side of the river, it houses the giant reclining buddha, another must visit, 100 thb entrance fee. To get to Wat Arun from N8, take the cross river ferry for 3 thb. Entrance to Wat Arun is 50 thb and closes at 6:00 pm. On the way back you can stop at N5 Rachawongse to visit chinatown (Yaorawat)."

After you climbed up all those crazily steep and narrow stone stairs onto the half top of the wat, while legs still a bit trembling, suddenly got astonished by the sunset overview of the river bank. Under all the shade of golden sunshine, the bustling river bank actually appears to be quite peaceful. However, calm down before you step off each stair as they seem to be more steep when going down.Wat Arun is just beside a pier, so most tourists get here by boat. Be cautious of the swindler who lobby you to take a \"much cheaper\" boat tour from some private piers. He/She pretends to give you a very friendly local advice. Actually, the boat tour from public piers costs about 500THB, but they will charge you 2000+THB."

However its still worth a visit to see the wonderful carvings and to climb the main temple which give great views. If you wander out the back of the complex there are small streets with a Klong running through. There is a 50thb entry fee. Enjoy!"

Be careful while climbing up and coming down the stairs. Just opposite of this temple other side of the rive is: Wat Pho, where we already had gone there, that place is also awesome."

You can climb the steps to the temple but these are VERY VERY STEEP, and what we did not apperciate, the steepness was the same coming down - I had to walk down backwards.The views from the top were amazing, you could see the roofline of both old and new Bangkok.The temple lights up at night, but we had left by this time.I think if the building works had not been going on, I would have apperciated it more.I do think it is worth doing as it is one of the must sees in Bangkok, and the entry price is cheap.Please also note that females are expected to dress conservatively, covering legs and shoulders. You can buy a cheap pair of trousers for about 150 baht outside the temples."

But as a resident of Bangkok, I can assure you that this should be one of the things you do on your visit to Bangkok. Wat Arun or The Temple Of Dawn is spectacular in color and design. The grounds are not huge so you will not be overwhelmed with lots of space to cover. Of course this is a Buddhist Temple. The porcelain and glass sparkles and the 2 demons that guard the temple are inspiring. If you attempt to climb the stupa, the central building to the temple, be warned that the stairs are steep and there are no railings or any object to hang on to, so be very careful. The murals and architecture are beautiful. Best way to get to Wat Arun is to take the boat from Saphan Taksin (first take BTS to the Saphan Taksin station). Then go downstairs, and take the local boat. It stops at all the piers. Do not take the tourist boat. It is much more money, unless, of course, you decide to get on and off the boat many times. Go to Tha Tien pier and take the boat across the river to Wat Arun. 2 baht. The temple charges 50 baht to get in but they may be asking for donations throughout the temple. Of course, Wat Arun is best seen from a distance, all lit up, so maybe a river cruise at night will give you great and lasting pictures of this beautiful temple."

Although shorts were allowed, they needed to be below the knees and no sleeveless shirts. They do have shawls to borrow for a small nominal fee, and I would recommend wearing shoes that are easy to take on and off, as you must remove them when entering certain parts.

I almost feel bad about giving Wat Arun just 3 stars but when compared to some of the other more ornate temples and opulent palaces it can be shadowed by it's more glamorous neighbours. It's only when you get close to the temple when it's true beauty and range of colours can be appreciated, a steep climb to the viewing platform rewards you with cracking photograph opportunities across the Chao Phraya and city. I wouldn't visit Wat Arun especially but if you're cruising along the river it's well worth an hour of your time."

The ticket cost is 15 THB, it will also be like a mini tour around the river (saves you 900THB on touristy boats!)"

It's very easy to get to - public taxiboat for 3 baht (no need to negotiate with the longtail boats) and seems to run very frequently. The temple is currently undergoing restauration - a mammoth project given the size and amount of intricate pottery covering the facades. It's considerably less 'bling' than the other temples and i really liked that slightly more 'natural' look. The buddhas looked gently aged and authentic compared to the highly polished versions elsewhere. This was the only place i actually saw monks! There is also a meditation center which i think might be open to the public.There is a really nice caf\u00e9 in the gardens which serves excellent iced tea/coffee/lemon&mint soda. This place is perfect if you want a break from the noise and touts of the other side of the river - if you have kids, this would be my first choice.Climb the stairs - they're not as bad as they look and view is spectacular."

There is an entry fee, about 50 baht I think?? Saves 100's doint it this way.... and if you get caught by the touters with the long boat special tours, will save you 1000's. Near the Kings Palace, and other tourist attractions, so if you are short on time, maybe best to go for one of the all in tours that speak your language."

Also be careful as it is hard to get to, with a lot of boat touts in the area meaning it is hard to get there for cheap. I'm sure it's doable, but I had to take a dangerous boat to get there as couldn't find the 'legitimate' route.The actual temple does have very steep stairs and they are hard to get down but don't let this put you off. You don't have to go up to the top. The actual temple was also a lot smaller in real life than I imagined it would be. It is near other major attractions like the reclining buddha and some markets so get all this into one day to make it worthwhile."

If you like Temples, it's one to visit.To get there, use the bus stop type boat from the N Stops, and make your way to N8. Should only be about 15 Baht per person. Then use the jetty alongside to get onto a ferry to hop to the other riverbank. This is only 3 Baht at the ticket turn style. At the other side, it's only a few hundred feet to walk to the entrance.There is a small cafe just before the entrance for drinks and icecream which is very handy on a hot day (today was 35 degrees).Make sure you are wearing respectable clothing, covering at least the knees and shoulders as with most Temples in Thailand.I hope this review helps you."

This Wat is nice in location as it takes you on the Chao Prahya river where cooler breezes blow (we hope and pray). The structure is much more beautiful from afar and with setting sun (or rising) a good photo op awaits the avid photo bugs reading this. But the closer you get to the building it is rather tired looking and not loved with mosaic pieces broken away and signs that \"WOMAN CANNOT ENTER\" for let us remember, we females with our menstrual cycles are a filthy bunch - try telling a monk that the reason he is on this earth is because of menstrual cycles. Still if you are new to BKK it is a must see, much like any iconic building/statue/cathedral/wat. Use a UV umbrella while in Thailand, it will keep you cooler."

The details of the temple is so unique. They use broken porcelain plates, bowls and cups to decorate the whole temple.My second visit was on Loy Krathong night.

You need to be a bit careful. Its definitely not scary or sth to be afraid of! - From Wat Pho you can go to Wat Arun for 3 Baht by a Ferry. The entrance at Wat Arun is 50 baht (for Wat Pho it is 100 baht)"

The ferry is different from the Chao Phraya boat. It cost 3Baht crossing the river by boat. Either sunset or sunrise, Wat Arun has the different views.

Wat Arun is an old Buddhist temple, you have to dress politely when in here.You can climb upstairs to get a nice cityview from the top of the temple.Beware the steep and narrow steps when climbing up or down the temple, surely you dont want to trip down from that height..afterwards you can buy some souvenirs from the stalls area right adjacent to the temple building. the price is quite cheap, especially if you are willing to bargain to get the best offer possible."

It was my first ever wat visited in Thailand on my first trip so holds a special place for me.The first time I went I walked across one of the bridges and to the temple on foot, getting lost and spending two hours of traipsing very non-tourist roads to find it (this was fun).However the ferry peer near the Grand Palace will take you across to Wat Arun for the current sum of 3 baht (about 5p in GBP) and you get to see a bit of the river as well.Wat Arun rises above the river. It's a serene little slice of paradise in my opinion, you can climb the steps up to the first and second levels and look over the river (be careful level 2 is steep and feels worse on the way down!)Also while you will currently pay 500 baht (\u00a310/$14) for a visit to the Grand Palace, Wat Arun is a steal at 50 baht (\u00a31/$1.5).So go spend your \u00a31.10 on a ferry ride there and back, and a wander in one of Bangkok's prettiest Wats."

The impressive central prang (Khmer-style tower) rises about 70 meters above the banks of the Chao Praya River, and is particularly impressive when viewed from a boat on the river.

The architecture of the building is amazing and the way temple blends in with all the smaller shrines allows you to take some great photos, both of the site and also the rest of the city that can be seen from the tower. You can climb up 2 levels of the tower, the first set of stairs are steep but manageable. The second set of stairs however are almost vertical! But it is worth it when you get to the top.The only thing that ruined it was the scaffolding and building works on some some sections, so the atmosphere of the place ruined a bit by this and can be an eye sore."

Closer to the solid, highly decorated edifice is covered with beautiful porcelain and offer further chances for fine photos. You can climb it if so inclined (it was raining and I'm getting old). But do prepare yourself: we had a guide but even a study of Wikipedia will help you understand it for what it is, not just what it looks like. we personally saw echoes of the Kajurao temples in India.

We were not aware, and prepared, that we had to climb up (and then go down) steep steps. Scary at first but worth it because of the wonderful view of the Chao Phraya river, other temples and the city. Also because it will allow you to have a closer look at the finer details of the Wat Arun.If you have time, go to the back and find more temples where monks are praying.Fee is only 50 Baht. Ladies should be decently attired (bring shawl to cover shorts). Drinks/food are available for sale within the grounds.Easy to reach by ferry for only 3 Baht from Wat Pho to cross Chao Phraya. I suggest that you take the same route (by ferry) back to Wat Pho to get public transportation (buses, taxi, tuktuk). Bus to/from our hotel was just 8 Baht. We tried to take the back route and got lost...I plan to go back this October and visit in the evening since they said that the lights are nice.The Wat Arun is included in a 2N/3D Do-It-Yourself (D-I-Y) itinerary for US$29 which I prepared for friends who are interested to visit Bangkok.

This temple is across the river and part of the fun is getting there via the local ferry which is extremely cheap (like 3 or 5 baht, I can't remember) that runs constantly. The temple itself is quite old, one of the oldest, and covered in old broken pieces of china and tile which make it beautiful but also difficult to maintain. The area is quiet and you can climb the outside on very steep stairs to get a lovely view of the river and Bangkok. It is a nice change of pace and a good place to go for a view of the city but if you are afraid of heights or wanting to see the gold and glitz of the Grand Palace you will be disappointed. But for a change of pace, lovely old temple, trip across the river, and good view then this is the place. Our guide recommended the duck soup sold there but my daughter got sick a few days later, I only had the broth and noodles and was ok but would pass on the street vendors!"

The return was via the ferry and took about 40 min . The temple area is quite exquisite in design and the top of the temple requires you to climb steep steps, but once you are at the top you are compensated by beautiful views if the river , the city and the Grand Palace and other popular temples .

Beware of these people, theres loads of them located along the harbour. Make you way to the water taxis (you will find lots of locals there). When we got to Wat Arun, we paid a small fee (50 baht) to get inside the attraction. The views were nice. You can climb the stairs to get to the top but we didn't bother as it looked really difficult. The stairs are very steep at the top and even grown men had to sit down to come back down the stairs.All in all, the visit to Wat Arun was ok but we enjoyed the Grand Palace more."

Travel Points to note1. If travelling with kids - there are people outside the temple with traditional Thai dress. They charge around 200THB for letting the kids wear the costume and take photographs, Its worth it2. The temple is on the other bank of Chao Paya river - Grand palace & Reclining Buddha are on one side (the side were people normally get dropped)3. There are ferry's taking people to Wat Arun from the pier close to Reclining Buddha and it would cost just 5 THB for the ride. One should not fall prey to the so called guides who try to cheat people by saying we will take you to Wat Arun ferry cost is 200THB etc4. Normally one should visit Grand Palace in the morning, followed by Reclining Buddha and then take the ferry to Wat Arun5. If one is going by oneself (as in taxi's etc) then note that after 5 PM getting taxi's is a problem and most of the guys then start charging flat rates. To avoid this suggestion is come back to the pier near Reclining Buddha and take a boat to Sapan Taksin (BTS station) - the boat is every 30 mts and will charge 40THB per person. From BTS station one can access any place in Bangkok. This way one can avoid being fleased by the Taxi guys6. The steps that take one upstairs of Wat Arun are very steep and can cause vertigo while getting down. But its still worth it as the view from upstairs is simply superb7. Visiting Wat Arun for sunset is must as the view is extremely beautiful - the sunset is normally around 6.45PM in summer and 6.20PM durng winter.8. If not sunset then sunrise is the other option Wat Arun looks beautiful on both occassions9. There are river cruises that operate on Chao paya in the evenings - one can take them to get a view of the lighting around Wat Arun in the nights (which is worth)Overall Wat Arun is a must go in Bangkok."

You are quickly met with a set of very very steep stairs which could be a hassle with small children, but do not let this dishearten you as the view at the top is well worth it. I would definitely recommend visiting the temple of dawn as it is unlike any other temple in Bangkok."

This is called the Temple of Dawn but most guides and guide books suggest going during dusk/twilight or even later when the whole place is lit up. Whenever you go, the place offers spectacular views of the river and the Bangkok skyline. Of course, the higher you climb, the better the views. Be advised that the stairs are quite steep and if you have dodgy back/knees or if you have vertigo/altophobia, then don't attempt it.The main central tower is surrounded by 4 smaller towers. The body of the towers are decorated with porcelain and sea shells. The central tower is topped with a seven-pronged trident. The base of the tower is decorated with various figures of ancient Chinese soldiers and animals. Over the second terrace are four statues of the Hindu god Indra riding on his elephant Airavat (called Erawan in Thai). The presiding Buddha image is said to have been moulded by the king RAma II. The ashes of King Rama II are interred in the base of the image.Though it is Buddhist temple, the name comes from the Hindu Sun God's name Arun. There is a fee of 50 baht(July 2014) to climb the tower, there is no fee for entering the complex. To reach the temple, you need to cross the river on a ferry; ferry charges as of July 2014 was just 3 baht. The journey takes around 5 mins."

Sounds great - the cost = 900bhat eachThe 'tour' ended up being 20 mins and the floating market was one woman in a boat (probably the captains nan) then we had a 20 bhat charge to get off the boat at wat arun.

We went here last 1st of Aug, there doing some renovations at the area but still you can walk up to the highest area tourist is allowed. To get here just take a shuttle boat across the river at Tha Tien terminal, very near Wat Pho Temple (Reclining Buddha). So best done after Wat Pho.3 baht/person only. The steps get steeper as you get higher. There are some hand railings to hold to. A must do if for first timers in Bangkok. There's a orange banner where you can write anything you want. The view from the top was relaxing. Overall be prepare to have lots of energy because this attraction is tiring.Dont forget your fluids!"

It is quite fascinating - the idea is to try and see it early in the day as the sun rises and also later as it sets. The colours and natural light effects are really wonderful.You can access it by river transport of course, taking the river express at the Taksin river station. It costs about 15 baht. You need to take a smaller boat which costs next to nothing to take you across to the Wat Arun site.If you're not afraid of heights, then you shouldn't miss climbing the steps to the top of the temple. You can see the skyline of Bangkok from up there and it is quite beautiful.Must warn you though that the stairs are quite steep - I saw people go up them with little children and held my breath until I saw them get safely down again.There are snacks and beverages on sale. You can rent local clothes and costumes and take pictures with these."

The journey is very short. The pier number where this is located is right by Wat Po- the reclining Buddha temple. The entrance is slightly hidden by a small market but it is no. 8 on the pier. The views from the top of the Temple of Dawn are magnificent but be careful climbing up as the steps are incredibly steep. For the ladies make sure you wear trousers as the climb down is very steep and could be quite revealing as some of the other tourists discovered. The steps are enormous and looking down is pretty scary. Also ensure that your shoulders are covered as this is a mark of respect and very important when visiting the Temples. An excellent visit. Seeing it at night is incredible too as it is lit up!"

Being scared of heights, I was too chicken to climb all the way up, and I regret it - don't make the same mistake. Bring sunscreen, water and a hat - and don't bring too much stuff with you cause it will only get in the way. One thing I didn't like was all the tourists crowding the place - they all probably think the same thing. If you want to avoid them get there early. Oh, one more point, the river boats don't take you directly there, but to the opposite bank (close to Wat Pho) - you have to catch a ferry to Wat Arun, which is right there and costs - wait for it - an entire 3 Baht! that's about 0.069 EUR; 0.093 USD; 0.10 AUD.

Explore the grounds a little too since there are some other interesting sights (incl. golden Buddha statues and towering guard statues).Ladies- save yourself some money in sweaty, used sarong rentals and just buy one of those cheap sarongs everyone's selling the first day you get to Bangkok so you can toss it in your backpack/purse every day.

I haven't been here for a while, we had some night photos last year and the year before.This time, i went up to the middle tier of the temple. It was an Asaha Bucha day, the day before Khao Phansa, Buddha Lent day. So it was so many temple visitors as well as tourists.It's really a great boat ride and we took a boat from Saphan Taksin to Wat Arun pier. Had to take two boats trip to get there.. The cost was 15 baht for regular river boat and 3 baht for ferry across the river. It was fantastic. We could capture quite alot of photos there and we were allowed to go up there until the middle tier.. It was a bliss and I was enjoying quite alot this time. There were a bit of renovation process going on and you have to be careful of the structures and built because they are quite vulnerable. So, please preserve and be careful of the stairs when you go up. The stairs are small and a bit slippery as well. However, it was not so steep and high compared to the Angkor Wat, so it's really for everyone and it was fun to see a bit from the top to the riverside.. Sunset photos are not that great, but I thought Sunrise photos would have been awesome.A must visit place when you are in the Bangkok City Center.. I would say."

It is inexpensive to enter (50 baht). You can see everything in a half hour. Make sure to bring a camera. In the surrounding area is lots of vendors with snacks, waters, and souvenirs but none really hounded you. Overall a must see in Bangkok. If you don't want to enter just hop on the ferry and at least see it from the water."

First of all, please visit Temple of Dawn (Wat Arun) before visiting Emerald Temple (Wat Phra Kaew) simply because some of you might be disappointed If you visiting Wat Phra Kaew first and than compare the two which are two totally different style and period of temple. Wat Arun is one of a kind temple!!! It is colorful( in closed up), old and simple nothing much but broken pieces of porcelain china from 19th century pieced together with beautiful design decorated. Wat Phra Kaew on the other hand Is more fancy, ornate with gloden accentS every where you looked. The whole Complex is stunning. Perhaps Wat Arun much better appreciated from the far distance or the other side of Chao Phraya River especially at dawn. It is gorgeous with all the lighting for its picture taking.Be aware of steep stairs to climb up to the top, but it well worth it. It is a beautiful view at the top. It is also very small temple and it won't take you long to finish up. It took me approximately 1.5 hours.If you take BTS, you will have to get off at Saphan Taksin and Take a orange taxi boat for 15 BTH( be aware that there are two taxi boat that take you to Wat Arun, one is more expensive than the other. The white flag taxi boat will cost 40 BTH, it's like a boat with tour guide that just tell you the history along Chao Phraya River). After first boat you have to take another taxi boat to cross the Chao Phraya River for 3 BTH. The fee is for Wat Arun is 50 BTH.Wat Arun should be to do list in BKK for sure."

If the sun is shining hard, be prepared: drink water, take shade breaks, whatever you need to do. There are rest areas in the corners where you can sit, drink, eat and smoke. There is also what looks like a nice cafe out front.This is a beautiful temple with plenty to see. The highlight is the cimb for the view. There are two levels to climb, the stairs are steep and the steps to the second one are even more narrow than for the first. Do not even think about it if you have any physical issues that make climbing difficult or you're afraid of heights. I shot straight up holding my GoPro, not looking down, left or right. But when it was time to go down, I can't pretend that I was totally cool about it. It helped seeing two cute Japanese girls really struggling to collect the courage to head back down so I just went down very slowly and carefully, sideways, one step at a time, like a 44 year old grandpa. No shame in being safe!This is probably my second favorite temple here (after Wat Suthat) and it's one of the two views in Bangkok worth the trouble: the other and easier one to conquer is Wat Saket (Golden Mountain)."

A must see in Bangkok!- stunning and beautiful, intricate carvings - lovely view from top- a little adventure climbing those steep stairs :)- you can see it from the boat ride but worth paying 50 BHT entrance - ladies need to cover legs can rent sarong for 20 BHT + depositNOTE: be aware of people trying to sell you boat rides for 300 BHT or more! Take the local or tourist boat (from Grand Palace then across river in total should not be more than 15-20 BHT for the 2 boats) and even from train station to the dock should be about 30-40 BHT. Do not over pay SO many people tried convincing us the cost was more. You can even get a full day boat ride hop on hop off for 150 BHT. Go directly to person at booth selling tickets to ferry (not tour companies at dock)BTW, I liked the reclining Buddha (Wat Po) even more, check it out too!Enjoy and don't get ripped off :)"

I take the orange flag taxi which costs only 15 baht from the Central Pier (Saphon Taksin BTS) and then take the cross river ferry for only another 3 baht to Wat Arun. I arrived at 10 a.m. and the crowds were scarce. However, when I left at 11:45 there were a lot of people there so I recommend going early. This temple is an incredibly beautiful mosaic of china plates in various colors and patterns. It is truly an incredible work of art. I climbed to the very top and took in the view of the river and city. However, if you are not up to taking the final set of steps (which are as steep as most ladders) then simply climb to the lower deck where the view is also quite good. If you climb the final set of steps you will be rewarded with a beautiful view, however you MUST climb back down as that is the only exit. After climbing the steps, be sure to take time to explore the grounds and side buildings. There are many magnificent golden Buddhas inside these buildings. You can reward yourself for making the climb with fresh coconut juice served in the shell and sold on site."

Yes, the Wat Arun is nowhere near as pretty as the temples within the Grand Palace, however, this site is far more peaceful, with far less crowds. Entry costs THB50 per person, and oddly enough, only women must cover their shoulders \u2013 men are allowed to walk around in thongs (flip flops), shorts and singlets.This temple is not pram / stroller friendly, but you can walk around the base of the temple, but don\u2019t even bother trying to attempt to carry the pram up to the second or third levels.The Wat Arun is worth going to especially if you\u2019re already out at the Grand Palace.

The ferry stations are worth it because of some really cool shops. also the station at Wat Arun has a nice little family run ice cream cafe for a snack. Wat Arun itself is a rather quick visit, but worth, the entrance is 50 baht and the excitement kicks in once you climb the first set of stairs, the second staircase is quite steep and not for the very faint hearted. I'm scared of heights but I made the short climb to get my kicks and I surely did. the view on top is pretty amazing and over all its fun. go for IT!"

Otherwise railway man will approach you & put you in the tuk tuk. My husband does insist on stopping & listening to everyone! OK so we got to see another temple .... & all for 20 Baht, but then the young boy dropped us off at the tourist boat rather than the cheap local boat. We only realized when they wanted 3000 Baht each! Eventually we got on 2 boats to the temple, one cost 15p each, the other 3p each I must admit I was exhausted by the time I got there & needed a rest & drink.

The temple is situated on the west (Thonburi) bank of the river opposite the Tha Thien Pier. This design of this temple makes it one of the most stunning temples in Bangkok, with its beautifully crafted and decorated spires standing majestically over the river. You can climb up the steps on the outside of the temple if you want to but the steps are very steep. From the top you have views over the winding river, the Grand Palace and the Wat Pho which is opposite. At the base of the central temple tower there are sculptures of Chinese soldiers and animals. As well as this being a tourist attraction, the temple is used by local Buddhists as a place of worship.Entry to the temple was 100 baht. If you got a river boat to the temple you have to pay a small fee at the landing pier so that they allow the boat to briefly moor to allow you to get off. The boats then wait for you in the river and pull back up to the pier when the driver sees you are ready to leave. The temple is open from 8.30am to 5.30pm and you should allow yourself approximately one hour to go around the temple. Make sure that you cover yourself appropriately, particularly shoulders. There are scarfs/sarongs that can be supplied for a small fee and a deposit is needed which is returned to you when you return the garment. Drinks and souvenirs can be bought on site."

I cannot remember exactly how much, but we did not break the bank by any means. When you get to the temple, you climb some very steep stairs to get to the top. It is always extremely hot in Thailand, so it couldn't hurt to have some water with you as well. Despite the heat, the view from the top of the temple is worth it all. It is very peaceful. I do not recommend the climb for young children! It would be very dangerous for them. There is rope and it is not an impossible climb, but I certainly would not want my children to try. There is no elevator to get to the top, so if you have any sort of mobility problems, this is not the trip for you. I would plan to spend 45 minutes to an hour here, between walking from the ferry to climbing, to walking around."

If you are anywhere in Bangkok, you can go to nearest BTS (blue line)/sky train subway station. Having a subway map handy from your hotel is good idea. Once you reach Saphan Taksin station (on green line), you are to look out for ferry terminal (subways has directions).At ferry terminal- don't fall prey to agents who would sell you expensive tickets. Go for 15 bhat ferry boat counter. Other charges vary from there to a bhat 100. Some tout tried to sell me aferry to floating mkt- 3000 baht..he came down to 1000 baht..that just put me off..By the standard ferry, one reaches the river side that is opposite to this grand temple. There is another boat (some 3 baht) that takes you across the river.I realised that best way to go to musuems, palaces is by this metro to ferry rides rather than catching tuktuks from train stations etc. I even ventured in their buses..but no english is used so we should know how to spell some words like Hualampong (main station) etc if we want to be adventurous enough."

And if you are so inclined, be blessed by the priests."

It is located right on the river, opposite from Wat Pho and is easy to get to from the ferry terminal, though it did require a change of ferry from the up river one to the cross river one. It's very cheap though, 3 baht for the cross river ferry and 15 baht for the upriver one. The temple itself has immaculate grounds, lots of cats, and the main pagoda can be seen from miles around. It was undergoing renovation work when we visited so some of the temple areas were off limits however the main pagoda was accessible. You have to climb about 80 or so steps to get to the top level and the stairs themselves are something to see, very steep. The view however is worth the effort to climb, you can see a good section of the river and city looking towards Wat Pho and the Palace. Beautiful craftmanship as always with Thai temples. Worth a trip to see"

Wat Arun has some VERY steep steps that lead you to a beautiful view of the surrounding area. The attraction costs only a tiny bit.Tip for tourists: This site, and all historical sites around Bangkok, are better visited with a good tour guide. Our entire Bangkok experience was better off for it (see my review of BKK tours for more info). Also, you should wear pants and cover your shoulders for all temples in Thailand. The locals consider it disrespectful if you dress more casual than that (though they are too polite to tell you so)."

Be warned: This is not the usual climb for tourists. Though the building structure is not high but the design of the step is VERY STEEP and not really for faint-hearted. Going up was still ok but coming down needs a little bit of patience and step-by-step movement. Saw some people struggling to make their way down .... No way is this place suitable for children below 4 years old. Entrance per person is 50 Thai Baht. Go during weekdays to avoid the crowds.Once at the top, a very nice sweeping view of the Chao Phraya River and Grand Palace (opposite) comes alive.Building structure has wear and tear and can see that the relevant authorities are in the process of some refurbishment and maintaining repair works."

They ask for 650 baht for some and upto 1000 bahts or more for some instance, wherein fact, the place is really close to the boat station. If you do this so, aside from the boat fee, you need to pay another entrance before you n get into the compound and another fee before you can go climb in wat arun temple. Also, there where lifesize dancing figures wherein there is a face hole so you can take pictures. You also need to pay for this after some one has taken the pictures.

I just had to go up and see the view and it was worth the climb! Considering that I'm 61 years old, I was wearing a skirt, and I'm not in great shape, I was pretty proud of myself! The climb is very steep and pretty nerve wracking, but if you go slow and don't look up or down, it can be done. Our guide was not very good and she didn't point out all the amazing parts of the temple and other structures. I didn't really notice all the beautiful tiles and statues (since I was so focused on not dying on the stairs - LOL) until I looked at my pictures later.

There's a 3 minutes ferry ride to and from the river banks which cost only 3 thb one trip. I've made it to the highest deck of the temple. Climbing up was pretty easy but getting down later on wasn't. The stairs up are literally a 85 to 90 degrees incline which is close to a total verticle climb up/down. And my legs are shaking all the way down. The second deck (highest) aren't really suitable for elderly or people with acrophobia but the first deck is fine for everyone.Entrance fee is 50 baht if things havent changed. You'll get a nice panoramic view of bangkok city at the top (second deck) which is beautiful."

And i am glad i went here, in fact i enjoyed it more that the Emerald Buddha and Wat Poh (the reclining Buddha), it probably had to with the time of the visit. Went here early in the morning (we were one of the first ones to buy the ticket). It opens at 8am. So avoided the bigger crowds that start coming in later in the day. Actually it is very good idea to get here early, as there is some climbing to do, and the heat later on in the day will make it more difficult. Even at 8, the sun was pretty strong! The views from the top of the river Chao Phraya were amazing. It makes it worth the climb. The main spire looks beautiful contrasted with a clear sky. And it surely is a beauty, worthy of its recognition as a landmark (you see it imprinted on the coins). There are some shops on the entrance on the river side, we bargained to buy a few small items, which i think was a good deal!"

It is just a quick (and slightly sketchy) boat ride across the Chao Phraya River. There are also some amazing restaurants and bars in the area that have amazing views of the temple lights at night.For the price and convenience, Wat Arun is a must see for any traveler.

The upper top level is a bit of a challenge particularly when you come to descend as the steps are extremely steep but if you can make it then the views around and up and down the river are brilliant. Relatively cheap to get in we got here late in the afternoon and it was pleasantly not too busy, although waiting to climb up and down was a bit of a task as people either bottled it going up or nervously put off matters to get back down. You just had to be kind and crack on or you could be there all day. The mosaic form of covering is superb and the temple itself a wonder of the city. Spend an hour or so just wandering around its base and if you do climb up then you'll remember it for a long time."

            "review": "Wat Arun - Excellently situated on the banks of the Chao Phraya River. Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn) is located on the western bank of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok and is one of the most popular attractions in the city. This large Buddhist temple that is enjoyable to visit and can be beautifully seen from the other side of the river. At Wat Arun (50 baht per person) was built between 1809 to 1851 during the reigns of King Rama II and King Rama III. Here you will find five separate Khmer style prang (towers), with the large centre prang towering 70 metres into the sky. You can partially climb the central prang by climbing rather steep steps found along its sides. The towers are decorated with encrusted porcelain and stucco figures that add colour to the temple when viewed from a distance. While attractive from up close, we actually prefer viewing Wat Arun from across the Chao Phraya River. Having the river in front of the temple adds to the view and makes for better pictures. In the evening and at night views continue to impress as the temple grounds are lit by flood lights. At Wat Arun, you will find souvenir stands as well as boat piers where you can feed catfish that reside in this part of the river. This is considered a lucky activity. Fish food can be purchased (10 baht) for a bucket of pellets or bag of bread. For those eager to visit additional temples on this side of the Chao Phraya River, you might want to make time to see Wat Kalayanamitr (large seated Buddha) and/or Wat Rakang as well. Combined these three temples make a nice way to spend 1/2 day on the western side of the river. Overall, Wat Arun is a very nice temple in Bangkok. It makes for excellent views and pictures from across the Chao Phraya and is worth visiting for those who want to see it from up close. Hint: For meals and drinks with excellent views of Wat Arun, try Bitter Deck or ESS Deck restaurants and the Eagle Nest or Sala Rattanakosin Rooftop bars, found near Wat Po on the eastern side of Chao Phraya River. We enjoyed each of these venues and have reviews for them here on TA if helpful. Hint: Ferry crossing from the Tha Tien Pier to Wat Arun is 3 baht per person and takes 3-4 minutes only. This is the cheapest and most convenient means for crossing the river to visit Wat Arun."

Get off the boat at the dock closest to Wat Arun (on the opposite side of the river) then take the ferry to the other side for around 4 Baht, then it's a 2 minute walk. around Wat Aruns gates there are also multiple food stalls that sell great food and fresh coconut(water). There is a sign post saying \"Tickets\" in front of the gates of Wat Arun, but the entrance is free of charge. At the ticket desk they charge you 50 Baht for a guide which is not present.It is not recommended for people that are afraid of heights.

It is enjoyable to climb up two steep staircase/ladders to reach different tiers and feast your eyes on the views at each level. This would certainly be a lovely place from which to watch a sunrise. The ferry shuttle across the river from the east side costs only 3 baht, about 10 cents U.S. The entry to the temple area costs 20 baht.

The temple grounds are quite neat and have a souvenir market nearby. Like many other temples, it's a requirement to cover your shoulders and knees. When I arrived I was inappropriately dressed with shorts above my knees. I had to hire a sarong for 100 baht but I get 80 baht back when I return it. The highlight of visiting Wat Arun is the excitement of climbing the stairs. It is so steep it is almost like climbing a ladder. The stairway is narrow and there are hand railings on both sides. It is definitely not for the faint hearted. The first set is not too bad but it gets progressively steeper in the next 2 sets. Between each storey of steps is a level where you are able to walk around the temple and see the city. The views are lovely. Going up the stairs was a challenge in itself but going down is the scary part. There isn't actually that much danger because you have the railings to hold onto and everyone moves down quite slowly but I think it's more a psychological fear that makes it scary. Definitely something I would recommend people to do in Bangkok. Since it is also very near the Flower markets and Chinatown we made good use of being around that area of the city for the day."

Yet another of the many incongruities in Thailand, which undoubtedly lead to the creation of the term \"Land of Smiles.\" Like many temples it looks better from a distance. The temple known for it's pearly iridescence, caused by porcelain inlays up close looks like someone dropped their best china and glued the broken pieces to the sides of the temple. The Wat Arun once housed the Emerald Buddha and was within the palace grounds. Both have now moved across the river leaving the poor Wat Arun in the low rent district. But the climb up the perilous staircase to the next more perilous staircase to the final staircase of death which can only be climbed by grasping the railing with both hands an pulling yourself up adds a redeeming nature for the thrill seeker. Once atop the temple one enjoys the breathtaking view while meditating in fine Buddhist style, \"How the hell am I going to get down from here.\"While the guards are not as strict as at the palace, woman probably should not wear short skirts, as the climb up the stairs would expose everything. This is a fun place to double dear your friends and loved ones to experience new heights.Note: The view of Wat Arun seems to be the selling point for all the boat ride shills. If you really need a boat ride, go for it. But Wat Arun can be visited by few baht ferry ride and a quick tuk tuk trip."

There is no doubt that Wat Arun, the Temple of the Dawn, makes a dramatic statement on the banks of the Chao Praya River.Though it is known as Wat Arun - it is actually best photographed in the sunset light from the perspective of the River.Please check with the concierge of your hotel to see if you can ENTER the Wat - because it has \"Restoration construction\" in progress.If you land you can (if it is open) climb up the steps to the top. To do this you must be VERY fit and have a good supply of water. It is a LONG way up. At the top you can't just hang around and photograph the surrounding beauty. Polite but firm temple assistants will move you on and down. There are many higher rise hotels in the area - take a trip to one and take an ice cold lime juice in the Roof garden and enjoy the equally spectacular view in comfort.You CAN rent a place in a long tailed boat for 500 baht and sail past Wat Arun with plenty of time for nice photos.

At the top of the temple - it's really worth climbing these rather scary narrow steps - one has a good view over the water and the nearby Wat Phra Kaeo temple. These two temples and Wat Pho (reclining Buddha) can easily be visited in one day, if one has the stamina to beat the heat (drink lots of water).

With an abundance of sea-shells and other adornments on its surface, it's easy to see why this would be the case. There is a dress code in effect -- they seem fine to tolerate tasteful shorts, but if you have short dresses they will rent you a sarong (their concern about the steep stairs and how short dresses would work there is understandable). Also worth walking around the temple grounds -- we saw a Buddhist monk in a nearby building meditating and interacting with the public, and there are some beautiful gardens as well. The view of the Chao Praya river from the top of Wat Arun is stunning."

Beware and be prepared to pay the 30 baht pp when you get off the boat and then to get into the Temple another 100 baht pp, not what they tell you prior to arrival. You can take all the pictures you wish. You have a VERY steep climb to the top, you will need both hands and one person at a time climbing up one side and you climb down the other side. This is NOT for someone who is scared of heights! It is a beautiful site up from the top, but you do need to be a little bit fit to make it and the last set of stairs you need to step sideways and the steps are about the height of 2 steps each. Take water as you will definitely need it at the top! The mosaics and statues are so intricate and beautiful you will really enjoy them. You can see the navy base from the top of the temple as well. Make sure to walk around and see the gardens to the side of the Temple, they are worth seeing and taking pictures of.

Where the others are immaculately preserved, you can see with this one the real history in its structures. The Wat its self looks to be hundreds of years old and construction of the temple sites is still occurring to ensure the temple is maintained.Like the other Wats/temples there are still many tales and stores inscribed into the walls and structures of every spire which are quite beautiful, and some are quite old that they are falling apart but in a kind of ancient beauty.You can also climb the very steep (and i mean steep) steps up to the halfway mark on the main spire of Wat Arun where you get a brilliant view over the city and the Chao Phraya river. Its definitely well work the short climb up. But if you are afraid of heights it may not be for you. But i must admit i really enjoyed it.There are also many gardens and other temples and building around the Wat Arun complex that make it an interesting visit, and it is also very cheap for entry as well which is a bonus.Id definitely recommend visiting this Wat if you visit Bangkok. This is really good to do with the big three if you wish to get a taste of Bangkok's temples:Wat Arun,Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew (emerald buddha)Wat Pho (reclining buddha)"

Just before the river bank boats station, turn left into a short alley. At the right end of the alley, climb the steps up to a bar restaurant. From the steps and from the upper level you'll see a magnificant view of the Wat Arun. I did it at night but this point, of course, is valid for a point of view, day time as well.

It's definitely worth climbing up the short, but steep flights of stairs to the top of this temple to enjoy the gorgeous architectural detail along the way and, once you reach the top, to look out over the skyline of Bangkok. I went about an hour before closing, which was perfect because the heat of the day had passed, the crowds had thinned and the sun began directly behind the temple, making for some gorgeous pictures. Ladies should wear pants/skirts that are at least knee-length. Although you can rent a sarong to wrap around your waist, if you forget."

Girls wearing short shorts/skirts can also rent long saris if needed. The temple itself is fabulous. There is so much detail with all the different animals and figures carved into it. The stairs to go up to the top are steep and nerve-racking, but once at the top you will have great fun taking photos of other tourists as they try to negotiate the stairs.

Unfortunately I did not get up early enough to see the morning sunlight illuminate the china mosaique patterns. Instead I arrived after lunch and immediately understood why Wat Arun is one of the most famous landmarks in Bangkok. It is completely stunning and has an interesting history if you're into that. The colourful porcelain used to decorate the temple had previously been used as ballast by boats coming to Bangkok from China.Whilst breathtakingly beautiful, be warned that the climb to the top of this temple may also leave you a little short of breath. It's quite steep with high steps and can be a little daunting for some. The views are lovely though so I would recommend chancing the climb. Maybe just take your time on the way down."

When visiting, take the stairs to get an overview of the beautiful area. You'll get a unique view of Bangkok as a city with the contrasts of old on the modern city skyline. Don't be discouraged by people who say it's difficult to walk up the stairs because of the height. It isn't. I'm afraid of heights and still had no problem doing it. A good tip is that you do it backwards when coming down.The ticket were only 50 Baht ($1,5)/person. When it comes to clothing, be respectful. No tanktops or short skirts. For men it is acceptable to wear shorts, but they have to go below the knee. Women have the oppurtunity to rent sarongs for 20 Baht ($0,7). So you don't need to walk around in jeans or long pants the whole day just because you want to visit the temple.Getting there is really simple. Take the BTS to Saphan Taksin, from there you can purchase tickets to the Cho Praya River Boat for 50 Baht ($1,5) /person. The boat ride takes about 15-20 minutes and stops on the opposite side of Wat Arun. Take the oppurtunity to vist Wat Pho (temple of the reclining Buddha) and Wat Phra Kaew (temple of the emerald Buddha). They're only a two minute walk away. Once you've visited these two temples go back to the pier and ask to go to Wat Arun. The tickets are 3 Baht ($0,1)/person and the boat ride takes two minutes. When you want to go back home just do the same trip, but in reverse."

Unlike most of the more popular temples it is situated on the west bank of the Chao Phraya river, The easiest way to get there is to take the ferry from Ferry landing N8 (Tha Tien) which costs 3 Baht each way. From the ferry landing it is a short walk to the temple and associated buildings including the tower (prang). The tower for a lot of people is the main attraction but the temple and surroundings should be explored. The tower is very steep and to get to the highest viewing level requires climbing two steep flights of steps. However, it is worth the effort as the views across the river are fantastic. On the way back to the ferry you can buy food to feed the catfish, the river is full of them!"

Try Sala, a new funky restaurant, or the old favourite Ambrosas. But, get there early. If you wait until just before sunset you won't get the prime front row seats. The rooftop bar at Ambrosas only opens at 5 (due to drinking regulations). We got up there just after 5 and secured a great seat and just drank cocktails until the sunset at 6.15pm. There are a couple of great restaurants along here that can be a bit tricky to find. it also pays to book, particularly if you want a window or river view"

It is a short ferry ride from the royal palace so i would recommend combing it with a trip to the royal palace. Takes about an hour or so to visit. The temple makes for some gorgeous pics from the water/ferry and up close as well. There are steep stairs (3 flights in total) to make it to the top. The view is really something. On one side you see modern bangkok, sky scrapers and all and the other side the royal palace with the chao praya river snaking through.Be warned the stairs are steep. they were not a difficult climb but my husband and I are young and quite fit so we did not feel it. wear shoes which do not slip and hold on to the railing and you should be fine. Around the temple (at the base) there are shops which sell \"ayutthaya costumes\". headgear and wrap around dresses which you can wear for a few quick pics dressed as an apsara or a thai nobleman. Renting these were not cheap unfortunately . you can bargain it down a little bit. and you can also ask for some mix and match versions. After hearing the prices we did the headgear alone and took some pics. This is if you want to do the regular \"i went to bangkok touristy stuff\"All in all this was one of the best architectural spots to visit in bangkok. We saw war arun from a distance later that night ,lit up . I cannot comment on those dinner cruises but i heard it is quite beautiful. i would certainly recommend seeing it during the day for the view from up top.the ferry across the river from the royal palace is about 4 baht. carry change"

We just stayed in the middle level and didn't dare go higher. Climbing is easier but going down makes you dizzy. But it was all worth it. Although they say the most spectacular view of the glittering monument can be seen best at sunset (we didn't have time to wait for sunset) it was still a sight either from afar or even very near.

I had imagined it to be taller and somehow more majestic. But when I saw it up close, I realised what an incredible piece of art it is. The entire temple from the base to the tip of the spire is covered in colourful little pieces of ceramic. They are arranged in beautiful patterns with rows of monkeys and demons in between. The level of detail and sheer hard work that must have gone into it are astounding, and make it all the more wonderful. Do make the effort to climb the steep steps (they're not as scary as they first seem) to truly appreciate its beauty. Personally, I found the complexity and aesthetics to be more charming than the other temples that seem to go with gigantic gold statues of Buddha - something that strikes me to be the antithesis of the Enlightened One's teachings. That said, even Wat Pho and the Palace deserve a visit, but if you're short on time, I'd certainly recommend Wat Arun over them. On the opposite side of the river (where the pier is located), there is a small restaurant right on the river with a stunning view of the temple at sunset, and good, cheap food too. "

As soon as you take the photo a little lady will pop out of nowhere demanding money.For 3 THB you can catch a ferry directly across the river to Tha Tien pier No. 8 where you can join the normal boats up the Chao PhrayaThe temple will loan you a sarong if you're dressed inappropriately, the best time to go is earlier in the day or later in the afternoon when it's not so hot to climb. If you're going to use the bathroom there, remember to take your ticket with you as you will exit outside the temple and may not be able to come in without paying again"

The main stupa is tall and of beautiful proportions. There is dress code for entering the temple (knees and shoulders should be closed); you can rent a sarong for a small fee on the spot. The stupa is fantastically decorated with sculptures, carving and ornaments made of broken porcelain items (I could identify plates in several cases). The legend is that the broken porcelain pieces were brought to Bangkok on Chinese ships as ballast. You can climb up the steep high stairs to the top of the stupa - you must be sure of you physical condition as it's quite an ordeal in the moist heat of Bangkok afternoon. The ascend gives you a chance to have a close look at the ornamentation and all the details as well as a great view from the viewing platforms located at several levels.

The steps are steep and going down can be a little scary at times. The temple is highly decorated with Chinese porcelain. The temple offers amazing views of Bangkok and at night it is lighted beautifully. It was under repair on the backside so it really didn't distract from the beauty. This use to be the home of my favorite Emerald Buddha. Just a very different temple that you can leave your shoes on which you will need for climbing.

We climbed the very steep steps of the temple and at the top landing, you get a very good view of both ends of the river as well as the areas around the temple. There was also a wide cloth ribbon draped on the wall where people were writting messages with a marker. You must be careful climbing up the steep steps but even more careful going down! They were also giving out free containers of water outside of the temple by the river. We gave a donation for their thoughtfulness. A nice temple with a good view."

The temple is a little bit different in the decor. The prangs are amazing with all the porcelain demons etc. Very different to Wat Pho (Reclining Buddha) and The Grand Palace complex. Not as touristy either. Great views along the river. We took the Chao Phraya River Ferry to opposite the temple (they don't stop at the temple but opposite it) and then you pay for a smaller boat to get you across the river to the temple."

You can get a boat on the river to a stop opposite the wat and then get a ferry across the river to the temple itself. The queue system was pretty confusing , however, to get on the river boats. The temple has many very steep steps to climb if you want to get a view over the city and across to the Royal Palace. Don't go up if you are at all frail and take it very slowly! However, it is really worth it if you can make it and the views of the city are stunning."

            "review": "Unique landmark. Wat Arun has been recently restored (in Thai 'art' means 'dawn'). It is definitely a unique landmark in Bangkok for many reasons. First, because of its symbolic architecture: a huge chedi (or stupa) flanked by 4 towers. The building reflects the symbols of the upper circle (the Sky) and the square delimited by the 4 towers (the Earth). The entire construction has been plastered with bits of chinaware so that it may glimmer in the morning light at certain times of the year. Hence its name, of course. Then, it holds a strategic position on the Thonburi side across the Chao Phraya River directly facing the East on one side and the West on the other. Consequently, it is worth seeing it at different moments of the day: morning, sunset and even at night. It is best to be on the Old City bank to see it then. Sunsets are really a magic time for this Wat.The stairs that lead up to the upper platform of the chedi are really steep (probably 75%) and are classified as one of the world records for stairs! As the temple is on the Thonburi side of the river, you must take a special ferryboat (only 3B) to cross the river. But it is quite frequent and quick to sail across. It costs 50B to get into Wat Arun."

The photo opportunities were amazing. Loved the fact whilst there were stalls you were bugged by the sellers at all. The monks were lovely to see and the place just screamed tranquil despite it being busy. I have heard bad reviews on how to get there. Best thing we did was a long boat. Takes you right to it and then across to the palace straight after. U can catch a long boat cruise which is private just you and you partner for extremely cheap around \u00a325 and it takes you up the river, through old city, through a small floating market, to this temple, let's you off and waits fir you for 30 minutes, which is plenty of time. Then takes you to the grand palace. Wish someone had told us of this boat trip before we came. Due to this we were able to see all the sights we thought would take a full day in a morning. Have robust this form of transport to get to the temple. The rest is just no where near as good. O and if there is more than two of you don't worry the boats have lots of seating, it's just they are hired out for solely your party for no extra charge. Would fit I would guess around 10-12 people max. But the temple best place to go! "

First af all, bring your good climbing shoes and some extra water, because you'll need it. Climbing the central prang (khmer tower) can be a challenge with its steep steps.

            "review": "Beautiful Wat in Bangkok. Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan or Wat Arun ( \"Temple of Dawn\") is a Buddhist temple (wat) in Bangkok, on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River. The temple is best reached by the ferry that crosses the river from the Grand Palace dock and takes about 5 minutes. The cost to cross is 5 TB (or about 16 cents USD) When you get off the ferry, go up the ramp and the temple is to your immediate left.For the foreigners, the temple charges an entrance fee of 50 baht (about $1.50 USD). It is definitely worth some time for you to visit the wat, though currently sections of it are being renovated. Women are required to wear pants,skirts or dresses that cover their knees and tops that cover the shoulders \u2013 no low necklines allowed. A pashmina or shawl that covers the essential areas is allowed. Gentlemen must wear shorts that reach the knees, and shirts that cover the shoulders. There are staff on each side of the entrance, and anyone who is not appropriately dressed are directed to a booth where they can rent acceptable attire. However, think about it. . .do you want to wear something that hundreds of others have worn without the benefit of laundering? Best advice is to dress appropriately and avoid the hassle.  The temple derives its name from the Hindu god Aruna often considered the personification of the radiations of the rising sun. Although the temple had existed since at least the seventeenth century, its distinctive prang (spires) were built in the early nineteenth century during the reign of King Rama II (1809-1824). The main feature of Wat Arun is its central 250 foot tall prang (Khmer-style tower) which is encrusted with colorful porcelain. The corners are surrounded by four smaller satellite prang. The prang are decorated by seashells and bits of porcelain which had previously been used as ballast by boats coming to Bangkok from China. The presiding Buddha image, cast in the reign of Rama II is said to have been molded by the king himself. The ashes of King Rama II are interred in the base of the image. The towers are supported by rows of demons and monkeys. Very steep and narrow steps lead to a balcony high on the central tower. The climb to the second terrace is steep but doable by most people. The climb to the top terrace is much steeper, with narrow steps and even with the rail is difficult. Coming down is more perilous than going up. So be honest with yourself about your ability, and don't be afraid to turn around and come back down part way up if you are beginning to feel unsteady. HNext to the prang is the Ordination Hall with a Niramitr Buddha image supposedly designed by King Rama II. The front entrance of the Ordination Hall has a roof with a central spire, decorated in colored ceramic and stuccowork sheated in colored china. Like all other wat in Thailand, if you wish to go in for a closer view of the Buddha you will have to remove your shoes.The best way to view the wat is from the boats that ply the river, and from the opposite bank. The place to be at sundown is the Amorosa Bar, part of Arun Residence, which hosts a restaurant (The Deck) and the Amorosa Bar. The place is fairly difficult to find as it is down an alley off the main road, and it is very poorly signed. Note that because so many people only come to take pictures and not buy any food or drinks, all of the tables along the river will have \u201creserved\u201d signs on them to prevent you from sitting at them unless you indicate you are going to eat/drink and then the ma\u00eetre d will seat you. They will allow you to go up the spiral stairs at the entrance of the restaurant to the bar above and take pictures for free. However, the reasonably priced food is quite good so you may as well relax and enjoy the beautiful view."

This temple has a 3 triered central tower and the steps become narrower as you climb up. The tower is tall and you can get a bird's eyeview of Bangkok once you reach the highest level. Though there are safety rails provided, it can be scary initially while climbing up or down. Nice stone carvings and statues make this temple a must on the itinerary."

If you can find the grand palace keep walking to pier 7, the public ferry and it will only cost you $3 to cross the river and then $50 to enter temple. The climb is worth it as the view is stunning. Only takes about and hour including river crossing and definitely worth doing. Skip Grand Palace."

It not explained as to where you need to cover your legs as there are areas that you dont need to so cover them all the time to avoid the hassle. As you approach a the temple there is a board you can stick your head in and look like a Thai dancer.....it cost 45 baht to take your picture......which I did not realize till after the picture was taken.....the sign is at the feet of the board which you dont see till its too late.

This reminds me a bit of the Hindu temples in Tamilnadu, India. The steps are very steep. As an asthmatic senior person,it was not easy to climb and more difficult to come down. Only the young and athletic attempted the 2nd and 3rd flight of steep stairs. The Ganesha statue in the complex ground was also unexpected in this Buddhist temple.Catch a ferry from the Pier No. 8-Tha Tien Pier, near Wat Po to Wat Arun. Cost us 3 Baht each.You can watch the temple and the boats on the river from the opposite side while having a meal at Restaurant Deck or another restaurant with similar name Ess Deck."

You can access it easily by ferry and if you are at the grand palace walk around the corner to the reclining Buddha and then to the river where you can catch a ferry across. If you don't like heights the climb can be scary as it is Really steep, but once at the top level you get good views. Entry is cheap. The excellent rating is also the experience of getting to the temple by ferry from down river. There is not much at the temple other that the souvenir shops at the bottom but I spent time up the top enjoying the cool river breeze and watching the fear on tourist as they tried to descend the stairs."

This is a great place to take photos in the beautiful dawn or dusk light. The temple has tons of intricate carvings, and some of the steepest, scariest stair cases I've ever seen the public allowed to climb. If you're scared of heights, you'll just have to observe from below. Great views of Bangkok from the top. Pleasant place to wander around. The only downside is that there are literally tons of tourists everywhere. Maybe try to come early when it's less crowded.To get there, take the Chao Phraya river taxi to the Grand Palace stop. Get off there and then pay 3 baht to take a ferry across the river. The lines look terrible, but move quickly."

You can climb up the wat which is cool in theory, but the steps are VERY VERY steep. going up don't look back. i got anxiety once i reached the top about going down because it literally looked vertical and got scared. not for the faint of heart. i went down the stairs backwards and held on to the rail for all my life. others were tackling the stairs frontwards which i thought was very scary.

Get off at No.8 Tha Tien pier and take the Wat Arun tourist boat to the opposite side of the river where the temple is located (the fare is 3 Baht).P/S: climbing to the top level of the pagoda is most highly recommended if you want to enjoy the beautiful river scenes of Bangkok.PP/S: not sure how many have noticed that Wat Arun is actually the reverse design of Thai 10 Baht coins"

Coming down is even more difficult and scary than going up. But when you get up the 1st level you start seeing the spectacular view. It is even better higher up.We have been to almost the same temple in Ayathuyya but it was not as steep climb though.After came down from the top, you can rent local dress for photo with small fee."

Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn) sits across the Chao Phraya River and is easily accessible by the blue Tourist Boat (150 THB unlimited all-day travel) plus 3 THB to take the ferry across the Chao Phraya.Unlike the rest of Bangkok, Wat Arun is well manicured and great attention is paid to keep the place looking clean. Surrounding the temple are gardens with trees, statues, and strategically placed stepping-stones. There was really only one peddler trying to get some of our tourist bahts, but he was pre-occupied with his most recent victims who were dressing up in Buddhist clothes and taking pictures by the temple. The entrance to Wat Arun was 50THB each and, like all temples, one\u2019s knees and shoulders had to be covered. We read about the climb and the steepness of the temple, but really didn\u2019t think much of it. However, this is something that is not to be ignored!Warning: If you are afraid of heights or have trouble get up and down stairs, you will not be able to make it up the temple steps! They are almost straight up and, at times, you are actually climbing opposed to walking. Regardless, it is worth the view.At the top, there is a nice breeze, which is sometimes lacking in Bangkok, and there are millions of pictures to be had. Also, there is a tarp at the top and we weren\u2019t sure if they were fixing something behind it or if they put it there for people to write on. The tarp was filled with signatures and we excitedly added ours to the list. This is definitely worth the trip and don\u2019t let the ferry to cross the river intimidate you, it\u2019s cheap and quick. Some people walk around confused about the ferry, just pay the 3 THB per way and jump on, you\u2019ll be glad you did."

You can get a ferry to it from Sapphan Taksin boat pier (by the MRT station of the same name) or you can visit it as part of a longer boat trip around Bangkok from the same pier. It's worth climbing at least part way up the central spire because this gives you good views across the river and enables you to look close-up at the seashells and bits of porcelain that decorate it. But, it gets pretty crowded and the steps are very steep in places without much in the way of handrail/places to hold on, so if you get a bit freaked out by heights and crowds perhaps go early morning (it opens at 8am)."

The main attraction is the central tower, which has been encrusted with porcelain and seashells.There are steep narrow steps up the tower, giving a view across the Chao Phraya river, not as steep as the steps for those who have been to Angkor Wat.

It is gorgeous. We also travelled across the klong on a boat to visit Wat Arun for roughly four hours. The temple is elegant with good visitor facilities (including a bookstore and gift store), bathrooms, and a chance to scramble all over the magnificent structure, whose fa\u00e7ade incorporates significant amounts of shattered Chinese ceramics and mirror glass that arrived in Bangkok as ballast on trading ships. The shape of the structures is extremely lovely. The temple location on the klong adds drama, as ever changing river traffic can provide a lot of entertainment. I would suggest taking one of the standard local ferry boats to the temple, then riding around the klongs on the ferryboats afterwards."

The construction of the tall prang and four smaller ones was started by King Rama II during 1809-1824 and completed by King Rama III (1824\u20131851). The towers are supported by rows of demons and monkeys. Very steep and narrow steps lead to a balcony high on the central tower. One need to be rather well fit to go up and down those steps."

Even so, my wife and I immensely enjoyed seeing this place. Wat Arun is lit at night, so you can still get a good look even if the main area is shut. Additionally, the surrounding grounds are very park-like, and you can walk among many beautifully manicured topiaries. In all, a trip there is not only a must-do in Bangkok, but also makes for a pleasant break from the traffic of the city. Speaking of traffic: if you want to take public transit, buses 19 and 57 have stops nearby and cost 8 baht one way per person. That's a good value, especially if you agree with me that bus travel in Bangkok is a combination of cultural experience and spectator sport."

The detailing on the walls is intricate and amazing, climb up the steps to the first level and start seeing the great view of the surrounding, the steps are steep, the next level is just amazing, the steepest steps I have ever climbed, you are suddenly transported to height from where the river front , the city skyline , the grand palace complex is all visible, a great view with the old and the new architecture superimposed on each other. The all around view is breath taking, you will run out of your camera batteries and memory, so much to capture in still and video. The climb down from the top is also a very daring experience. This experience Will stay in my memory for a very long time. Strongly recommended if not afraid of climbing heights, but should definitely give it a try."

When you alight @ pier 8, you will be on the wrong side of the river... So you need to take the transfer boat, which is even smaller, for 3 THB. It sounds cumbersome but it is not!

Because the temple is covered in a mosaic of tiles and old porcelaine plates it sparkles in the early morning sunshine. From a distance it looks like a Thai version of the Eiffel Tower and it is the most noticable landmark beside the river. You can get to it easily by express boat heading south from Phra Pinklao Bridge (the nearest jetty to Kaosan Road), which is in Phra Sumen Road. You can get off the express boat on the opposite side of the river and then pay a few baht for a boat across to the Wat Arun Jetty. It costs about 20 baht to go in but is well worth it for the views of the various chedis and other temple buildings.There are several Buddha images inside one of the temple buildings near the entrance and there are nice tropical plants outside."

The climb is definitely not recommended for little children or adults who are scared of heights or have vertigo. I bravely took my 4 year old girl up to the 2nd level. Going up wasn't a problem as she climbed on her own but coming down didn't look safe at all - I had to carry down her in my arms."

At night, Wat Arun is lit up brightly with changing coloured lights.

We decided to visit this Thai temple as it was mentioned as one of the attractions in Bangkok.The interesting thing is, besides the temple the actual journey itself was quite an experience. We stayed at Anantara Riverside during our trip to Bangkok. Our hotel provides a complimentary boat taxi to one of the main piers along the Chao Phrya River. Therefore to get to Wat Arun we took a boat taxi to one of the main piers and then onto another taxi to the pier on the opposite side of Wat Arun. We then took one final boat ride to get across the river to Wat Arun. The boat taxi is reasonably priced and one can even buy a day pass for any trips up and down the river.On arrival at Wat Arun there is the main pyramid like structure with a few smaller temples around. If you are up for the climb (walk up the steps) you can pay a fee to get into the main structure area. Otherwise you can admire the structure from ground level and see the smaller temples in the area. At the ground level there are some food stalls where you can have fruits and fresh coconut water (truly a thirst quencher on a hot day). There are other stalls on the side which are selling souvenirs including clothes for quite a good price (feel free to bargain)Overall a nice trip to see one of Bangkok attractions including the journey along the Chao Phrya should not be missed."

The entrance fee is just 50 baht (compared to the astronomic 500 baht at the Grand Palace), it's not overrun by tourists, and the souvenir shops are not located on the grounds of the temple, but in a building close by. This results in a temple you can walk around and look at and take pictures of in peace, without being trampled on by guided tours and harassed by aggressive sellers. Plus, the temple itself is awe-inspiring, at over 80 meters tall. It is possible to walk almost all the way to the top, which gives you a beautiful view of the Bangkok skyline, but be careful, as the steps up there are extremely steep (and a little slippery!)And don't listen to the tuk-tuk drivers telling you you HAVE to take a river cruise because it's the only way to get there!

The floating market consisted of 3 boats in the canal that came to you trying to sell you drinks and even for the driver. The long boat ride didn't need to be so long but you know when in Bangkok. However the biggest catch was the price 2000BHT was way too expensive - look to pay about half of that if you going on a private trip. That's the biggest thing."

We chartered a boat to do the canal cruise and got there without any hassle. However, the boat ride was quite bumpy given all the speed boats and heavy traffic on the river during the day. The Wat is the least colorful amongst those by the river but it was done at a period and modelled after the cambodian architecture. At night with the bright lights around, the temple looks much more glamorous in photo and real life. It is worth visiting if you are a first timer in this city. If you are not visiting during the months from Nov to early Feb, go late afternoon, the heat is much more bearable."

You can go on a tour, but you don't need to, just walking around on your own is a rewarding experience. Look up close to see the strange and interesting details of the temple (it's a unique design I haven't seen replicated since). Like many places in Bangkok, the earlier you get there the less crowded it will be. I would suggest approaching it by boat and then making landfall to do a wander."

It is not as large as some temples, and not as lavishly decorated (as it is decorated mainly with broken ceramics), however unlike other temples you get to climb it. I use the word climb with good reason, the steps are scarily steep. The first set of steps are normal steep steps and are of no concern, the second set of steps are very steep, but one might let a carefully supervised child climb them, the final third set of steps I'm not sure I'd let a young child climb. Especially seeing as they are far more scary on the way down than on the way up. A few people climbed up the third set of stairs and then realised they had a petrifying climb down ahead of them.It's quite easy to get to the temple, you can take a boat from the central pier north to Tha Tien boat stop (N8). This drops you on the wrong side of the river unfortunately, but on the pier next to the one where you are dropped there is a boat that takes you across the river for only 3 bhat (6 pence)For 50 bhat it's incredibly fun, just come prepare for a mini adventure"

Once you reach the top you see the old houses, adjoining beautiful buildings and you imagine how royal priest have felt ages ago. I loved this temple because it is decorated with broken ceramic plates! All kinds of design patterns and colours are together! In an magnificent way soooo simple. Of course the hardest part was coming down as there is no handrail or anything to hold on to unless you have a partner!

It was an experience, although crossing the river is only 10 minutes.Also, you need to pay to climb the pagoda. Majestic temple. Unfortunately our tour give us only 30 minutes to explore. Need more time. Looking at picture online, I would think that night visits will be better as the view is fantastic with lights. Read somewhere that there is dinner cruise that allows you to view the temple, maybe will try that the next time in Bangkok"

There is something about it that practically screams authentic. Instead of taking your shoes off and shuffling through crowds of people in tightly enclosed buildings like at Wat Pho, here you are outside, touching and feeling the ancient architecture, climbing (steep) stairs to the top, and getting an amazing view of the river and Bangkok in general. If you can only visit one temple in Bangkok I would make it this one."

            "review": "Unique, imposing and spectacular monument of breathtaking beauty.. Wat Arun is an imposing Buddhist temple on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok. It consists of a main pyramid-like central tower surrounded by four smaller ones. There are outside stairs on the main central tower leading to an open balcony-like corridor running along the perimeter of the structure. From there one can take another set of stairs that are quite steep and with taller-that-average steps, leading to a second open balcony higher up the tower.Wat Arun (basically the central tower) is a huge (at least 67 m tall), impressive structure. Also impressive are the surfaces of its walls, which are embellished with all sorts of figures, shapes and statues. These consist of myriads of colourful porcelain beads that are embedded in the walls.The visitor is strongly advised to walk up the stairs and visit both balconies, as this will bring him very close to the artwork on the walls and so get the opportunity to study the whole thing from a close distance and admire the fine detail work and the painstaking effort that has gone into its creation. Another reason for climbing up the stairs to the second balcony is the view of the surrounding area from up there; it is magnificent, exquisite and panoramic! And a word of caution: going upstairs, especially to the second balcony, requires a firm, athletic body!Wat Arun impresses by its sheer size and unique, breathtaking beauty. It is equally attractive at night when it is illuminated by spot lights, making for a rare, marvellous spectacle.In my opinion, Wat Arun is the star of the Bangkok sights. It is not to be missed."

After visiting Wat Po we managed to find our way to the pier crossing (very simple, only three streets away) and happened on the 3 baht ferry crossing to Wat Arun.Crossing Choa Phraya is a little adventure in itself and you can see close up the various boats doing the longer boat trips.Once you dock, for 10 Bht you can feed the enormous fish (and pigeons) that live near the dock. It is a short walk to the temple and for a small fee you can climb, and I mean CLIMB, this lovely structure.A reasonably steep ascent to the first level gives you lovely views across and down the river, but brave it and take on the almost verticla second level. Stunning views and a real sense of adventure and another example of an easy to do attraction, without relying on organised trips."

The climb of the stair is not that easy but short.

Worth visiting inside considering the art work.\nTemple of dawn doesn't look good as in the photos as they have changed the lights little ago. The lights are switched on at 6.30 pm. It is not worth visiting at night. Wasted lot of time waiting for the lights."

Not for the faint of heart.We went by around 4 in the afternoon. Took a 3baht ferry from near Wat Pho (reclining Buddha). It will take you 5mins or less to cross the river. Once you're there, there is a 50baht entrance fee. There is a really nice view of bangkok from the top.We stayed there for a while since we were waiting for the lights to come up. Its around 6:30pm when it does. Well the thing is we thought and expected that that the lights outline the structure, well, it doesnt. Its just a spot light from the bottom. It was more beautiful looking from a far than near from where we were. Since it will create a detailed picture with the shadows when you're far.But it was a great experience and I would definitely would want to climb it again."

Plan well so you can visit the Grand Palace, Reclining Buddha, and Wat Arun on the same day since they are all in the same area.Wat Arun requires you to take 2 ferry rides (<30 THB per person total) if you go from the dock closest to the Grand Palace (no direct boat from this dock unless you are willing to spend a lot more for a local to ferry you directly). One boat to go to the next dock on the same side of river. The second boat to cross the river.Worth the visit.Amazing how they built this temple.If physically able and scare of height, must climb up its steep stairs to see from the top level.Has a nominal entrance fee.

This temple is available for visitors to climb. The view from up top is amazing and allows you to see up and down the river. The 2 sets of stairs to get to the top are STEEP and may not be a great idea for those afraid of heights. There are no other ways to get to the top or get back down other than the steps. As many of the attractions (temples, palaces) in town, they will not allow you to enter the grounds in a short skirt, shorts, or tights (or pants they deem too tight, I was wearing tights under my shorts but they wouldn't even allow that) I highly recommend you take a long sarong with you everywhere you go if you don't want to wear shorts during your trip.The fee to enter was cheap and I highly recommend checking it out."

The asking price for each person was a scamming amt of 1000bhat, we eventually settle it 600bhat for each person for a boat since they were the only operator at that area fyi, we are the only guest as well. and of course the tour on the boat only lasted 30min instead of what we have agreed 1 hr. unable to communicate totally with the boatman. we alighted at wat arun temple."

A four hour river tour on the river would be time better spent visiting Bangkok. IMHO. If you have ample time, then include it in on the day with the Reclining Buddha since it is so close. It is just across the river and ferries are just 10 to 20 minutes apart. The cost is very cheap"

Since this was the first temple that I saw, I loved the ceramic decorations and dancing people made out of ceramic pieces. There were some wonderful sculptures as well.

His stall was the only one around the area of Wat Po (nearby the restroom)He told us that the Wat Arun (Wat Arun is just opposite Wat Po) had closed (it was abot 4 pm when we decided to have a rest after visiting Wat Po) & suggested to go to the LUCKY BUDDHA etc....& silly us, we went to the temple. Upon reaching the temple, there was very less people there & suddenly, out of nowhere, there is a guy, who was very-very friendly , explaining the history of the temple.In the end he recommended us to go to a shop selling local goods & we went there only to find out that it was a gem stones shop. Nowhere to see any local goods!Wat Arun is a good location to appreciate the beauty of temple.

Although we have been there many times we make a point to still go on occasion. The magnificence of the place and the intricacy of the sculpting cannot be overstated. One fun way to travel there is by taking the Chao Phraya Express boat to the dock directly across the river. Then you hop on a ferry across the river to dock right at the Wat. The cost for both of the river rides is very inexpensive; less than a couple dollars total for both, and they are ways Bangkok locals use to get to work and home. So you get a real Thai experience, not like the tourist boats that ply the river. I don't know if the tourist boats stop here or not. I also must tell you that neither the river express or the ferry have handicap access so be cautious of that if needed. Oftentimes when we step off the ferry there are people there holding pythons, etc that offer you a chance to take a picture. Be warned that they expect payment for taking your picture with the snake or, for the ladies, in a traditional Thai dress. This is Thailand; just go with it and have fun. It's only a few bucks, too. We took my parents here several years ago and my mother still has the picture of her in the Thai dress in her living room to this day. It's a great conversation piece. In short, Wat Arun is amazing and anyone with a couple days in Bangkok would be remiss not to see it at least once."

It is simply magnificent and significant! Even there are hundred of \"Wat\" in Bangkok, however for me I still find it very different from any other \"wat\" in Bangkok. Obviously It is among one of the oldest Wat, and that's why it is unique! Too bad that the sun was so fierce on me that day and I was not able to make it to the top of Wat Arun. When there is another chance in future, I will go Wat Arun at night time! Besides to stay away from the cruel sun, I eagerly wish that I can be given a chance to admire the beauty and mystery of great Wat Arun at night with lights on!!^.^* To respect the local religion, long pants or sarung please especially for ladies. :p"

Climbing first lot of stairs is fine but beware the second lot of stairs they are very narrow and steep and don't look down until you get to top landing. It is worth the climb as the view is stunning and regret not going in late afternoon for sunset but probably would not have climbed the steep part of the stairs. Excellent photos taken but when I looked down the stairs I freaked out and took me a couple of minutes to get courage to get down. Definitely worth a visit."

Paid entrance fee to the place at 15bht, another entrance fee to the temple itself for 50bht.Nth much inside, came out and the boat was gone. Nobody to help us and we had to ask for directions to take a tuk tuk to leave the place.This clearly means the temple and anywhere else they claim boats are the only transport are FAKE.Felt totally ripped off and not worth the price at all even tho the temple is pretty.Terrible experience.Encourage tourists to take bts to the various piers for any boat rides.Btw, went on a tuesday 1st oct 2013, the water is terribly dirty as I believe there are floods.Water is in muddy colour with rooted trees floating along.Boats were of such low quality that I am more worried for my safety instead of enjoying the view."

I would suggest going there later in the evening - around 4pm and staying until the lights comes on at about 6:30 pm. This allows you to not be in the heat and burn up as you climb the very steep steps to the top of the temple. The crowd also seems to taper off by this time and so the photo opportunities get better, especially with the temple lit up. Another perk is that you also get to watch the Buddhist service that starts around 6p in the temple behind."

There are other ways to get to this place, for example you can catch a water taxi. Our guide told is that this was the spot where the new capital of the old Siam was founded in the 18th Century by the King Taksin. He arrived there at dawn so he honoured the god of dawn, by building a Temple and calling it Wat Aruna, after him. The temple itself is very interesting. It is characterised by steeper steps than usually found in temples. As well as this it is quite a small site. The reliefs are intricately embellished with ceramic mosaics which creates a sense of fantasy about the place. There are monks who live on the site and who can be seen sitting and meditating under trees or just putting out the garbage. In keeping with the rest of tourist destinations, there are small souvenier stalls and opportunities where you can either put on a dancer's head dress and have you photo taken, or put your face in a cut out image of a dancer and have you photo taken. The money raised goes to help with the upkeep of the temple. There are also the river cat fish that come to be fed. They grow to an enormous size mainly because they are unpleasant to eat, so they just live in the river, entertain the tourists and earn their keep by generating income by eating the bread they buy from vendors for this purpose. This is a lovely place to visit. If you are on a spiritual journey and want to take the trouble, you can come here at Dawn, or even Sunset for that matter and meditate upon the state of the planet or the position of the sun in the sky. Otherwise it is quite a pleasant stop on a longer canal tour. It is important to get it that Bangkok is essentially a river city and doing a canal tour reveals the truth of this. Good for photos, take your camera. Bit risky for small children, older children will have your heart in your mouth because of the steepness of the stairs and because of the shallow depth of the steps. Real falling off the mountain territory."

Upon reaching the top, we were rewarded with magnificent views of the city, but the real thrill was in the descent! If you have a fear of heights, prepare to confront it, or you'll be stranded atop this soaring temple for quite some time. We finally chose a backwards, one-foot-at-a-time retreat, gripping railings for dear life. Ok, it wasn't quite that bad, but it sure felt great to feel both feet on solid ground again. Worth the trip across the river for the close-up view of the intricately carved architecture, the view from the top, and the rush of adrenaline scaling the structure. Definitely our favorite wat in Bangkok."

It was beautiful and worth it. It costs 50 Baht to enter the temple, and it's open from 8 AM to 6 PM daily.Climbing the stairs was dangerous, but an amazing experience. The view from top is amazing. Be careful while climbing down though.GETTING THERE: I thought it's difficult to get there, but it was pretty easy. Catch the BTS Skytrain (Silom Line) going towards Bang Wa (that's the name you'll see on the boards on the railway station). Get down at Saphan Taksin. Check out the exit towards the boat ferries (known as Sathorn boat ferry station at the Chao Phraya Tourist Boating Services), and take a ticket (costed me 40 Baht) to Wat Arun (which is the Station # 8) of the boat. There are proper boards, and announcements made in the ferries, so don't worry. Once you reach the Station # 8, which is actually known as Tha Tien. It's the opposite side of the temple. Then take a ferry to Wat Arun to cross the river (costed me 3 Baht), and there you are. Click on this ticket's photo on my website to open a higher resolution.Although it's a temple and I went there in shorts, I was not stopped by anybody, but it's always good to go there in decent dresses. It's very hot there, so wear accordingly."

Standing majestically over the water, this temple is a stunning vision of art and architecture. Two giant demons guard the entrance gate. Wat Arun is one of Bangkok\u2019s most noted landmarks, its most revered temple, and the image that appears on the 10-baht coin of the Thai currency.It is called the Temple of Dawn. It was covered with colorful mosaics of porcelain, and embellished with sea shells, elephants, monkeys and mythical figures, as were the four smaller towers (prang or spires) surrounding it. The grounds were quite extensive, with multiple structures. The chanting of monks could be heard in one of the temples, while a craftsman was busy at work at the steps of another temple.The central prang offers excellent views of the old city of Bangkok, if you are up to ascending a steep climb. Climbing these steep, narrow stairs symbolizes the challenge Buddhists face reaching nirvana. Although you are only allowed to climb to the second of four levels, the steps were still enough of a challenge. Descending the steps can even be more unnerving than climbing them.If you\u2019re in Bangkok, you have to visit Wat Arun.2MovingTheChi.com have been traveling since April. First in the U.S. and currently in Thailand. For additional photos and information on Wat Arun, visit 2MovingTheChi.com."

Feeding the catfishes at the landing pier was more exciting than sighting or visiting the Temple.It has, for me, one redeeming grace. Outside the Temple are photo-stations where you can costume yourself in a traditional Thai outfit and have you mug shots done. No need to pay the entrance fee to get into the Temple of Dawn.Near these photo-taking stations is a black statue of an individual flanked by elephants. There is absolutely no signage to throw light on who or what is represented.I thought it was Peter Pan! But then, maybe it was Droopy. Who knows?The visit is often a hurried one. Your duration to drink in the sights depends on when your boat leaves. Buy your entrance ticket, explore the Temple ... then find yourself rushing to meet the deadline for the boat's departure."

At first I walked all around the outside of the wat that you didn't have to pay to go in and looked at the outside temples and statues which were themselves cool, but the obelisk in the center is the main attraction, of course, and it doesn't disappoint. You can climb all the way up to very near the top, although I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who is weak, either physically or constitutionally, as the stairs are steep and tiny and it's a long way down. But if you can make it to the top, you are in for a treat. You can see the whole river and all of Bangkok behind it. I took some choice photos of me and Wat Pho and Wat Phra Kaeo, which you can see clearly from the top. The tower looks really cool as well, it has ornate designs all along it.

It is nice to take the ferry across and to see the Wat from the riverside.\u00a0The steps up the Wat are incredibly steep and not for people who are scared of heights - also not ideal in flip flops. Once you've reached the top, there is a good view of the tops of the monasteries and the river.\u00a0Wat Arun is a good introduction to temples and takes less than an hour to get around but if you are really short of time you should give it a miss. Entry is 50B."

There is a lot of detail in the temple, and while the climb up the stairs is ridiculously steep, it is worth the view if you are able to easily get up the steps!The first time I went to Wat Arun was super early to beat the crowd, I got there at 7 am, and nobody else was around; however, the sun wasn't up... This is something to be wary of if going during monsoon season. The temple was much prettier during the afternoon when the sun was out. So my recommendation is to try to see this temple when the sun is out & shining.Also, DO NOT TAKE A TUK TUK OR TAXI straight to this temple... It takes way too long. Instead have them drop you off at Wat Pho (reclining buddha), from wat pho there is a ferry near the market on the river where you can buy 2-3 baht to take a ferry across to Wat Arun, and then back again. This is much cheaper than taking a tuk tuk or taxi which might just drive you around longer than you need to get more $ anyways.My General Tips to Surviving Bangkok:-Taxi meter > tuk tuk! Tuk tuks generally try to give you a cheaper rate, but will drag you around to different places in Old town such as tourist agencies & suit shops, because they get free gas if you stay there long enough or buy something from the place. I only paid 40 baht for a 2.5 hour ride to a few sites, but also was brought to 3 places I didn\u2019t want to go to, and was really annoyed. So while it is cheaper, it can also be a hassle if you are limited on time.-Always tell the taxi driver to turn on the meter.-Don\u2019t shake hands with the people trying to sell you something, or the guys who say \u201cHey Brother\u201d or are trying to get your attention. They know how Westerners operate, and are trying to have western behaviors to lure you in so they can pitch their sale to you.-Best way to avoid them is to say no, look straight ahead. Don\u2019t waste your time or theirs.-When buying stuff, haggle haggle haggle, especially on Khao San road. You should never pay full price for anything they are selling in the markets.-Carry your wallet in your front pocket, or better yet get a money belt, or one that goes under your shirt and around your neck.-Do not argue or get in a very heated discussion with the tuk tuk drivers or taxi meters. While many are friendly there have been incidences or tourists being harmed & killed for not paying things as little as 50 baht. Sometimes it is just better to be \u201cripped off\u201d and pay the guy what he wants, than to argue over it.-The earlier you get to the temples, the more quiet and cooler it will be.-Don\u2019t open your mouth when on the river, that water is pretty gross, and a few drops landing in your mouth could make you sick.-Street food, restaurant food, drinks, silverware, cups, straws\u2026 They will most likely be contaminated at one point or another, and it isn\u2019t because they don\u2019t clean the items, but because many of the Thai people do not regularly wash their hands after using the bathroom, even in restaurants.-Bring antibiotics, buy them when you get there, and make sure you get your vaccines & shots you need to before coming.-Learn some Thai words before coming, like \u201cI do not want\u201d or \u201cI will not go\u201d"

The steps do get very steep which is very nerve racking but you don't have to go all the way up if you don't want to. The detail on the structure itself was incredible. The ferry to get to the temple is very cheap (3 Baht each way). Worth a visit!"

If the god -of- dawn is what you named your daughter,then this striking Bangkok landmark will strike a resonance with you. Its main prang is 79 m with acircumference of the base at 234m You will love the ornamentations created with broken pieces of porcelain. The style of this monument is Khmer architecture and its unique ,symbolizing Hindu-Buddhist cosmology. Climb the steep steps on the central prang and as you start to experience the tightening of calfs and knees,you may appreciate that this grade is as difficult as reaching higher levels of existence. You can climb halfway when restoration work allows. The degree of difficulty is high. Take your time and keep breathing. The four minor prangs are decorated with niches, inside of which are statues of Nayu,the god of wind ,on horseback. An interesting aside as you admire the colorful porcelain used to decorate the prangs was donated by local people. River views are best appreciated from the elevated levels of the prangs as well as from the river cruises and ferries on the River Chau Phraya."

I took ferry from Pier (N9) Wat Pho after exiting Grand Palace. Direction : After exiting Grand Palace, turn left and then again turn left from the corner. After walking for some time from your 2nd left, ask for pier to Wat Arun, you will be sent to pier N9. At pier you need to take ticket at the counter (Baht 3, each way) Ferries take off about every 10 to 15 minutes and operate daily from 06:00 till about 22:00. Walking around the temple gardens and looking at it from a distance is free, but if you want to enter the temple compound and climb the steep stairs, it costs 50 baht. The temple grounds are opened from 07:30 till 17:30. Thousands of foreign tourists visit the temple everyday, many of them by canal tour early in the morning.As we were tired, we just saw the temple from outside and did not buy the ticket."

If you suffer vertigo be careful about going down the steps from the top.....it is incredibly steep.It's a 3 baht trip by ferry from the wharf closest to the Reclining Buddha. My suggestion would be to go very early, see the Reclining Buddha first, walk to the wharf, catch the ferry then spend an hour or two here."

Entry to the temple is free for local, small entry fees are applied for overseas tourists. Dressed appropriately. No shorts - no thongs - no sleeveless tops.

It was quite breathtaking and good to get a sense of Thailand and Bangkok other than the shops and street food. I didn't climb all the way but my partner did. The few steps I climbed were tricky, going down even trickier. I wish we had have had more time to dress up for the photos with my daughter."

The detail looks amazing (until you see the chedi at Wat Pol (sp). Again, best to see at night unless you want to climb it."

The steps up the temple is very steep and probably not advised for older people. It is indeed a nice and wonderful place to visit if you have the energy to climb up the stairs. Each step is quite high and almost requires you to bend your knees. So you can imagine how high the steps are. We were amazed how they managed to build such a high temple! And also wonder the reason behind the high steps. Try to go all the way up and you will get to see a breath-taking view of the river and city."

You can take the boat across the river from Tha Tien pier for 3 baht (one way) & admission to the temple is 50 baht. As mentioned by almost every other reviewer, the views are fantastic, the temple is magnificent.There are 4 stairways up the main pagoda, the first set up is pretty manageable. The 2nd set of stairs get steeper, so it might be daunting for some as it was almost a 180 degree upward (& downward) climb. As with most temples in Bangkok, you need to be respectful and cover legs and shoulders, rental of sarongs at the entrance of the temple can be done. Side note, best if you didn't climb up the pagoda in a skirt/dress, especially if you don't want your undies turning up in some other tourist's holiday photo. As mentioned earlier, the stairs is literally 180 degrees upwards and downwards."

Hello trip advisor people Today i see it is Wat Aruns turn for some unnessessary complaining/moaning by more tourists.We have people moaning about various situations ranging from having to pay 50 baht ticket froma ticket seller?? to the temple being tacky run down and crowded? too many tourists and bad location? The main source of complaining is having to pay these huge 50 baht fees to see an outstanding beautiful historical temple of thailand (wat arun) My heart bleeds for these people..how do they afford this huge 50 baht charge for boats, temples? Considering their flight probably cost anything from 30,000 to 50,000 why do theycomplain about paying a very cheap 50 baht to take transport or to enter a buidling or historicalarea?To be able to visit such a wonderful temple is in itself an honour, i think many people all over the world can only dream about visiting any part of thailand let alone the temple of dawn. Whydo so many people complain about something when there is nothing to complain about.Its no wonder that on occassion thai workers in the tourist trade sometimes get fed up with visitors.I think it is an insult to the great thai people when tourists complain and moan about50 baht fees when we all know that they can more than afford it.Stop and think one about what you are seeing, the temple of dawn is not something that was built a few years ago. This wonderous temple dates back to the 17th century and has so muchhistory following through its time.Some tourisst have complained about wat arun being too crowded, well what do they expect from a major tourist attraction in bangkok? Do certain farangs think they will arrive at the temple or any other tourist attraction in bangkok and be the only ones there?Can we not come back down to earth and be happy and honoured to see such historical and beautiful sites rather than search for something to complain about and ridicule?I read where one tourist had reviewed the wat arun as tacky, god only knows where they link tacky with wat arun. These sort of people obviously have no culture understanding education or forward thinking about travel.I think its a great insult to thais if they have to read about the varied rubbish that some tourisstdeem true about some thai sites, cultures, trips etcFor those tourists reading this about to embark on their thai travels around bangkok. take it from me and understand that the temple of dawn (wat arun) is a 100% must see wonderfulexciting cultural experiance which you need to enjoyOh for those who are worried about the HUGE 50 baht fees for certain thai sites boats etc stay at home and buy yourself a POT NOODLE and immerse yourself in its culture.Ok my trip advisor people talk soon spigs"

There are other little bits to the temple area, not just the main temple. A beautiful gong - you can hit 3 times for luck, and a set of 5 bells you can ring. Beautiful gardens and paths with amazing \"Dr. Seuss\" trees, trimmed so they're little balls on curly sticks. Wonderful!The Temple of Dawn, Wat Arun, is a massive talk spire, but the lower levels have steep steps up the sides to about half way up. Its fantastic. Wear only sensible grippy shoes, no slaps or slippery sandals. Only go if your knees can take it. Take note of the direction most people are going. It's dangerous to go up when everyone else is coming down. Walk around the 'balcony' at the half way mark,....take your camera, but make sure you hang it round your neck, as you need both hands to ascend. And then up to the top for an astonishing view all the way over the river, and temples. Really interesting and unique.The temple itself is different to others in that it's ceramic...that is it's covered in ceramic plates and dishes for decoration, weird and eccentric...but totally beautiful. We loved it."

Take the 15 Baht river taxi up and down the Chao Praya to reach this wat and it's counterparts across the river.

Although I didn't climb it (too steep), my partner did and was impressed by the views. You need to be suitably dressed to enter but if not, sarongs and scarves are available for hire at minimal cost (deposit refunded). I was particularly impressed with the history of the formation of the city of Bangkok, which was originally built with its back to the river. But they soon realised that the river could act as a 'moat' to protect the city from the invading enemies and moved across the river to set up the city. It is amazing that the temple wasn't razed by invading forces as in Ayutthaya. Just as well as it is a tourist spot well worth visiting."

Wat Arun always houses a number of cultural museums in its ground and the assortment of the antiquities were quite something to behold.There are plenty of areas for one to sit down and take in the grounds and gardens.

Lovely temple and nice location.... river side, peaceful environment, looks marvelous in evening lights.good architecture to see. they have a park behind the temple (river side), good to roam around in the evening.Shoulders and Legs need to be covered while entering the Temple premise, so better avoid shorts/skirts or off-shoulder clothing else take scarfs/clothes on rent at the temple.Good place to visit."

I left my camera bag with my wife and daughter and went up with just the camera. A big mistake! It was tough climbing up with a heavy camera hanging from the neck. I was really worried that it would bump against the wall. However, the effort was worth it. You forget everything once you reach the top. This is also a nice complex by the river and you can spend some time here. I was there late in the afternoon as I wanted a sunset view and wanted to photograph it in the evening. The sunset view wasn\u2019t great as it became a bit cloudy. We crossed the river and there is a park next to the ferry station. You get a good view of the temple from the other side of the river."

It is so different to the other temples in Bangkok and the location on the river is magical. I went in the evening right before it closed and was one of about half a dozen people there. It is well worth the trip across the river (3 baht for the ferry) and it is close to the Grand Palace if you want to visit before or after going there.The stairs are very steep, but the view from the top is worth it!"

This one was very different and worth climbing the stairs for the view over the river. It was 50 Baht to enter, and they don't let you in with skimpy clothing on. I got in with a short sleeve shirt and long shorts on without challenge.Easiest way is to get the BTS Skytrain to Saphan Taksin make your way to the water taxi and get the boat to stop 8, it should cost 15 baht. Beware of the people selling 40 baht express tickets, unless you are in a hurry. The Orange flagged boat is the one you are looking for."

He took me to the end of one street by the river and a guy with a boat asked me for 1500 baht and said that it includes a ride in the boat for 30 minutes and then drop off to the temple across the river. I told him that I read on the internet that it takes 5 bahts to go across. He told me that there is no such thing and I can either swim across or forget about it. Even the guy at the Tuk Tuk that I hired for last 4 hours and treated very well told me that he is right and thats the only way to go across. I told them that never mind just drop me off somewhere else and i'll skip this temple. Because I had a feeling they were not telling me the truth. I found out later that the tuk tuk drivers get a kickback from these boat owners for bringing the tourists to them. Ideally I found the pier below the BTS station and paid 5 bhats to go across."

The days of the beautiful , quaint canal(klong)cruises are long gone. Instead get the cross rive ferry for 3 baht. save at least 997baht and get at least 250million fewer E.Coli in your mouth from long tail boat spray."

It is a stunning view of Bangkok. To get to the Temple of Dawn on your own, first make your way on the Skytrain to Siam. From there take the train to Saphan Taksin. Take the stairs down to the walkway to the pier. Do not get confused, just keep walking straight. Someone will help you if you look lost. Take a boat from here for 200 baht to Wat Arun. When you get to the Wat, you will be charged a 10 baht disembarking fee. The entrance fee to the temple grounds proper is 50 baht. Keep your ticket handy in case you want to go to the toilet or get a drink. For those not afraid of heights and who can manage the steep steps you will get one of the best views of Bangkok. For the rest of us you can take in the decorations of the temple. Here you will find porcelain that has been cut and used to make the decorative patterns. It is quite a delight. There are places to get drinks and buy typical kitsch. You might want to try on one of the costumes and pose in front of the temple. The young men and ladies will take your photo for you. On your return back you can catch a river boat to any other destination. To get back to the Central Pier it should not cost you more than 200 baht. If they try to get you to pay more just smile nicely and tell them you only paid 200 baht there. They will not argue with you and if you are lucky you will get your ride back on one of the very fast long tails! It is quite the ride (not for anyone nervous about fast boats though). This temple is also not for the very feeble. It is difficult to get in and out of the boats and you would only be able to see the lower levels of the temple. Also if you are temple hopping in Bangkok, ladies will need their shoulders covered and they will be needing to wear a skirt (and not a short one). Young men need long pants. There are always sarongs to rent while you are inside if you forget. Also easy on and off shoes are essential."

We rode a long boat through a river to the temple. In the middle of the river you will be offered to buy bread to feed the fish in the river. It cost 20 Baht (70 cents USD). When you arrived at the temple you will see many souvenir booths. And you will also find a cardboard cutout of a Thai couple with traditional dress. It has two holes on the face of the thai couple. Nobody sits near the cardboard cutout, and you will be tempted to take photos with it.After you finish taking photos, somebody will suddenly appear and ask for money. It's not free, you know. They will ask you for 40 Baht (USD 1.5). It's small money, no big deal. But the way they trapped you what makes it not fair.After that you will see the Tower of Wat Arun in front of you. It is not that tall but quiet challenging. Because when you climb it with the stairs, as if you climb it with ladder. It is almost 90 degree angle. Piece of cake? Wait until you go down. It is more challenging compare to going up.I saw one tourist has to be accompanied by her friends to go down the stairs. She almost cried. By the time she reached the ground, she has to sit down and catch her breath for almost 20 minutes. it is obvious that she's an acrophobic."

Tip: for a nice or romantic drink in the evening: go to the other side of the river, directly opposite Wat Arun and go to The Deck/Arun Residence. That's a bar on the 3th or 4th floor with an open view to the temple and the river. it's 120 baht for a small Singha beer, but on Khao san Road it's also not getting cheaper and over there you're sitting on a crappy little plastic chair with a view on drunk backpackers and streethawks."

There are not much to see at Wat Arun, as I have read in the net that there is nothing really special from Wat Arun when you see it from near.Not knowing what else to do, finally I decided to walk up the ladders to the top, it's a long trip to Wat Arun from south of Jakarta ;) so it would be a waste if I don't do what I can do there while I'm there...... STUPID stupid decision :D after finishing the 1st part of the stairs, which is quite high already... the second part is much worse, it's way more steeper and the steps are smaller, it's just about a span. To go up I have to hold both the railing left and right to make me more stable, at the top when my friend took my picture from below (smart girl, she doesn't want to go up :P ) I looked down (to face the camera of course), immediately regret came in to my mind and I was in frantic not knowing how to get down as it looked way steeper from up there then below, and getting down must be harder then going up.Finally after being dizzy looking down, I walked around the top of Wat Arun to calm myself too, the view is really great, you can see the Chao Phraya river, it's a pity I left my camera with my friend, so I can't show the view here, and the soft breeze is just great though the sun is still striking it's force. Ok... time to go down. With lips unstoppingly hushing prayers, I tried to go down holding both of the railing on my left and right facing down, besides being steep and only having small steps, the height for each steps is very high, when I stood up on one step I could feel the next upper step is on my behind.Finally when I reached at the bottom all I could say was \"Thank you Lord, I arrived safely\" while trying to catch my breaths back and tried to stand straight again with those wiggly feet. Seriously... that \u2018incident\u2019 made me traumatized with stairs for around 2 weeks."

The towers (prang) are decorated with meticulous porcelain mosaics; the central prang architecture symbolizes center of the Buddhist universe, Mount Meru, as I read. While you climbing (careful, very STEEP) steps you are reaching different base which each symbolizes different level of thirty-three heavens.

If you have an hour to spare at nighttime this is definitely the time to go see Wat Arun!"

You're already mesmerized. But the closer you get, the more beautiful Wat Arun, The Temple of Dawn, becomes.You soon realize that the temple's majestic silver gray colour from afar is in fact a rainbow mosaic of thousands of ceramic fragments which cover every surface. An amazing effect!What's even better? You get to climb halfway up the main spire. But be prepared for a \"steep grade up ahead!\" The final flight of stairs is as steep as an almost vertical ladder!! BE VERY CAREFUL, hold the railing, only take 1 step at a time SLOWLY.Of course, you'll be sweating like a sow in the tropical heat once you get to the top, but the effort is worth it. Your reward is an amazing view across the buzzing Chao Phraya River to the many golden spires of the Grand Palace, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and the Temple of the Reclining Buddha, all sitting majestically side by side on the opposite river bank.Arrive soon after Wat Arun opens (7am) and you'll be rewarded by cooler temperatures, less crowds (you'll have the main spire almost to yourself) and the sight of many Thais making merit by feeding the many happy, healthy temple cats. A very special place in Bangkok. You'll love it!Easiest way to get there: take Chao Phraya River Express Boat to Tha Tien Pier (N8) which is on the opposite bank directly across from Wat Arun, then take the smaller cross-river ferry to Wat Arun from the same pier. Very easy, safe, cheap."

If you had difficulty with the first steps, then REALLY think before attempting the next level. If you are bothered by \"edges\", it will be quite the challenge coming back down. I had to grab the railing and literally come backwards down the steps. If you have knee/hip problems - don't even think about the 2nd level. The 1st level will be YOUR challenge for the day!

It is about 60 to 70 degree sloopy.The only thing that I shall advise tourists is that do not take photo with the costume boards outside the temple. This costume boards are actually owned by the local. If you take the photo with it, the local will ask you to pay about 40B. I was careless this time to take photo.The moral in this trip to Bangkok is that the local people are more cunning and take advantages of tourists.

Far far away and high up in the sky there was a temple called Wat Arun. it was built with a view overlooking the Chao Prya River if you have the heart to climb each stairs, each ot the individual steps are not your conventional steps at your home but higher than usual. A look down from where you are would actually let you know how high you have climbed therefore you have been warned!All I can say is this is a beautiful place to go and if you are not much of a temple fan, try this to make it your only temple to visit."

It's a bit frightening on the way down. PS - Our guide walked us through the tables afterwards and stopped at a \"dessert\" stand. Had we not been with a guide, we would of walked right past it. If you go, look for a stand that has foot long bamboo pieces stuffed with rice inside. You pick the one you want (we had the darker colored one) and another man has a hammer and cracks the bamboo open and gives you the dessert inside. Ours was filled with sticky rice, coconut milk, palm sugar and red beans. It was WONDERFUL! My boyfriend and I fought over the one we bought to share. They stuff the bamboo and then roast it over a fire to cook the mixture. We haven't seen it again since :("

The plan was to go there after visiting all the other Wats at the other side of the river via boat ride. However, there was an ongoing Royal parade by the river so we had to take a cab which took us about 30mins where in fact it could have been less than 10mins by boat. It was worth it though. We got to climb to the top of the Wat. It was stiffed so it was scary when going down. We were able to watch the parade from the top so that was a good experience.Tip: Try not to take a cab from that place coz it will take you long to get one due to traffic jam. If there's no choice, ask a tuktuk driver to take you to the closest subway station instead. Keep your tourist map handy."

The climb up and down the temple is steep but it's not too bad. Just watch out for those people who can't understand signs and walk up the down stairs or down the up stairs.

There's so much to take in ---- the colors, the designs, the extraordinary figures, the serenity and the humor in its style. As you walk around the Temple your eye will take in different perspectives at every turn. Yes, you can do a lot of steps, with great views as your reward, but if you're not a climber (or if the heat has already fried you) you will still have plenty to take in and enjoy. Go one direction and pass a row of golden-colored Buddahs, another and discover a small garden.If you are visiting the site on a tour, as most do, try to do some advance reading so you'll know exactly how you want to use your time here.

To come to the temple from the Grand Palace you have to take the ferry boat to the other side of river. The fair is very cheap price (3 baths). It is the religious place so it requires proper cloths. But don't worry for your shorts because there is also sarung hiding service."

This temple is quite unusual in its design and it never fails to impress with its intricate tiling. The views from the top over the river are great on a sunny day too. In one of the temples the children received a blessing from a monk in return for a voluntary donation, but it was a new experience for them and this is what makes Thailand special. They kept their string bracelets on for the rest of our holiday, so it meant something to them."

Wat Arun is something you should not miss on a trip to BKK.It's easily reached by using the express boats that go up and down the Chao Phraya River and taking a quick 3 baht transfer boat accross to the dock leading directly to Wat Arun. The temple itself has a 50 baht entrance fee and strict dress code (esp for women), the ticket seller is located in a little wooden kiosk amid all the hawkers just east as you approach the temple from the dock. On entering, you'll see an old thai lazing on the side of the wall in a lounge chair as if he were taking a break (this is the ticket man, so don't make the mistake of trying to duck him, or he'll start yelling at you as if you mooned his mother).The Wat itself is is pretty colorful and impressive (according to many histories, it was decoraged with salvaged porcelin from the balast of chinese junk wrecks in the river), it depicts all sorts of Hindu deities and budhist iconography, but the most impressive thing is the view. Climbing up the near vertical steps is an experience (the steps are well over a foot and a half tall with only thick hardened hemp rope as hand holds) and there are three tiers of this (only two are accessable), but once you're up it is well worth it for the view and the light breeze (the latter so rare in BKK).After that crowning achievement there's not much to do except to go down again...that's where I had a problem. I'm not at all that afraid of heights, but facing a near vertical climb down, made me hesitate (i hung around the top pretending i was having a religious experience so i wouldnt feel that bad about my newly discovered achrophobia). It took waching a 90 year old Chinese lady shimmy down the stairs like a mountain goat to gather enough courage to leave the top.If you're only going to see a few temples in BKK, see at least Wat Arun, and once you're at the top, remember, a 90 year old Chinese lady made it down, so you can do it too you big baby!"

If you look closely enough, the temple is actually made of porcelains which Thai people received as gifts or from bartering in the past, and they didn't know what to do with some of it, so they broke it up and made it into shapes of flowers or all sorts and used it to make the temple. As the results, the temple is filled with colors and shapes that are just so creative and resourceful. Magnificent!!!Make sure you climb up the temple too. The view at the top is beautiful.

Maybe because it was almost 5, the closing time, or maybe because it is not on the tour-group itineraries, I don't know.However, we really loved our visit and are glad that after the initial hesitation looking at the steep steps to climb, we climbed right up to the top. One gets a close-up view of not only the temple, its carvings and embellishments but one also gets a fantastic view of the river-front. Even though it was a hot day, a cool wind was blowing to cool us down.The access to Wat Arun from Wat Pho is also easy. Just walk 3 minutes to the pier, on the way browse the touristy shops if something catches your eye, take a public ferry - for 3 Baht - and get down on the steps to Wat Arun.As a structure Wat Arun is really beautiful and one of Bangkok's major attractions.

Steep climb but you can come down backwards and it is easier."

The beauty of the broken china mosaic artwork takes my breath away every time - as does the steep walk to the top. I also find getting there \"romantic\" (albeit a bit gritty) as journeying the waterways in Bangkok always makes me feel as if I'm another world.Additionally, I always find the best bargains from the vendors here. Who'd have thought?If you have kids, definitely buy some food to feed the fish."

A word of warning this climb is not for the feint hearted and it was easier getting up than getting down. My friend and I certainly got a sense of vertigo from the top.Please don't let this put you off, take you time and do the climb is well worth it.Another must see if you are in Bangkok."

The only drawback is getting to it as you may be open to con-men - as you are at any major Bangkok attraction. Some even wear a uniform style outfit (light blue tops I've noticed a couple of times) and best be aware of them. they'll be outside or on the water transport.The only place to buy your entry ticket is at the actual entrance to Wat Arun - not on the ferry coming to it from across river, or on the boats going up and down river. it's worth going to - don't let my words of advice put you off!"

A word of caution,while climbing down ..dont look down the stairs as it can make you dizzy.Entrance fee is 50baht. Worth a visit!"

Approach some hotels located near BTS Station named Saphan Taksin, you can find this boat which can carry you touring inside the city of BKK. Believe me, it is a amazing experience to take a look inside Bangkok city on a river. Wat Arun, The Temple of Dawn has the highest Budda Tower in Thai. It is the most elegant pagoda, landmark of Thailand also. Besides, I find it's very attractive because of its outlook. Covered by ceramics and shells with different Budda stories in each floor made Wat Arun very special. You can take many beautiful pictures there. If you have power and energy, please climb up those stairs to take more wonderful pictures. Don't miss it!"

Another option would be to just hang out around the Wat grounds. The grounds are well-kept with a nice garden nearby where there are benches to sit and rest. So you can take a break enjoying the afternoon breeze while sipping an ice coffee from the little stall next to the garden (actually saw a few monks buy some drinks here), which is really nice."

It was interesting to see where people lived on the canals - some nice places and mostly not so nice places. At one point there was an older lady in a small boat selling trinkets and drinks and she encouraged us to \"buy a beer for the boat driver\", which we did!We arrived at the spectacular Wat Arun and climbed the steep steps as high as we were allowed to for the beautiful view. I bet it would have been lovely at night-maybe next trip? If you have short shorts, you can rent a sarong to wear, right beyond the gate. My daughter did this and I think she received a deposit back when she returned the sarong. We stayed for about 45 minutes-it was very hot and quite a climb, so bring water and stay hydrated. Don't forget your cameras.When we were ready to leave, we spotted our boat driver and waved him over to pick us up. It was a short, direct ride back to the pier. I think the entire trip was 2 and 1/2 hours, including the time at the temple."

Once there enter the grounds and climbed the temple stairs. Great views from the top (about half way up) but stairs are very very steep. *) Admission Fee - about 50B*) This temple is considered to be the most famous and photographed temple in Bangkok, which features a soaring 70-meter-high spire decorated with tiny pieces of colored glass and Chinese porcelain.*) Once you start visiting this places you have to very careful, people keep misguiding you. Take a tourist group and go, then you will not waste time searching for this place.*) The stairs are quite steep and you really have to hold on to the rails to ensure you won\u2019t fall. However, be warned that climbing up is the easy part. Climbing down is quite scary since the stairs are really that steep. I found it is much better for me climb down facing the stairs. However, we cannot discredit the beauty and history, not to mention architecture of this site. It was truly breathtaking. All I'm saying is, if you don\u2019t like heights, it might not be for you. You have to earn those memories with a steep climb up stone steps to the first level which provides lovely views over the river and surroundings. The real test awaits those who tackle the climb up to the second level. Beyond any question whatsoever, this is not for the faint-hearted.*) There wasn't a very strict dress code and we didn't have to remove shoes. *) Try to shoot this from the river so you can get it all in. Fabulous in the daylight, amazing at night.*) It is easy to go this temple just crossing river after visit grand palace and Wat Pho. *) Tip: Visit after being to Wat Pho, and if possible in the evening when lights add up a magical aura to the place. you really don't need to spend long hours when you come to visit this attraction - an hour would be more than enough.*) My Verdict \u2013 Must-Visit.

Get off at the last stop at Wong Wan Yai. Go down to the street on the Exit C side to catch a taxi, which there are plenty, so you can easily make a left turn toward Wat Arun. It should take about 10 minute in a taxi. Very easy!On the way back, taxi isn't easily accessible, so you'll need to take a boat across the river, then wait for another boat back to Saphan taksin. We waited forever for the second boat, as many boats pass by, none were going south. By the time the correct boat arrived, it was packed. If you don't get on then expect to wait another 15 minutes on the rocking dock and smell the fume from all the other boats passing.

You will need to take a boat before you can reach Temple of Dawn. It is a fast ride of about 5minutes. Take the chance to enjoy the breeze of the sea. You may get the chance to see a boat sailing items! Definitely an eye opener for Singaporeans like me. You will need to pay a small fee if you would like to climb. However, becareful as it is very steep. If you are afraid, best to stop at first level. It's easier to go up than go down. Thus, I did not climb because I was with elderly people. If you were to walk further in, you could see stalls selling food and some accessories. If you have intention of purchasing a Souvenirs or clothes or even bags from there, do remember to bargain!! You don't get to bargain a lot in Bangkok so take the chance to bargain!! The place before you take the boat sells a lot of roadside food and dried food. Not everyone would dare to eat it as you can easily see flies around! I would suggest that Singaporeans don't purchase the food as our stomach may not be able to handle it.Before you leave for the boat back, you may also buy some food and feed the fishes in the water! Food cost around 10 baht! Birds will also come flying to eat the food!Gentle note would be: Don't purchase Naraya Bags outside Naraya shops because high chance is that, you will be purchasing it at a higher rate."

Most access the temple via the watertaxi from Chao Phraya River Express (just about 10 baht one way) @ Central Pier near Saphan Taksin BTS, that plies the waterway regularly and 30B temple entry fee (foreigners only). To take note of the following tips when visiting Wat Arun:1) There are steep steps up the temple...for ladies wearing skirts, you will \"entertain\" fellow visitors below you as you climb the stairs. So to preserve modesty, jeans or other covered bottoms would be well advised. 2) The daytime view from atop Wat Arun is lovely...you can catch the Chao Phraya and the surrounding areas panorama. That is if you do reached the highest allowed point.3) When going down Wat Arun, do descend slowly with your body facing the stairs (like in a cramp yacht stairway) for safety and to avoid the jitters (especially those with acrophobia) 4) The edges of the temples are constructed of pieces of broken ceramics and can be rough...move around with care to avoid injury.5) The jetty at Wat Arun has shop selling leftovers bread, etc. You might like to feed the tons of catfishes that inhabits the pier area..of course, the pigeons will drop by to compete for the food. Makes for interesting holiday videos :) 6) There's a few Thai heritage costumes shop just at the temple foreground that rent out costumes (the type you see worn by traditional dance performers)...shoot with the temple at the background for keepsake... about 100-200/per session. Bring your own camera. Prices subject to change. Do haggle a little. 7) Visit at night for a different feel as the temple is lighted up at night..Best viewed at Tha Tien pier...the temple closes at 530pm Have a great time at Wat Arun..."

The actual temple itself is beautiful, decorated from bottom to top with sea shells and carvings. If you are brave you can climb to near enough the top, get great views from the top and see more of the temple however to there the first third is normal steps but from then on it is very large, steep steps all the way 70ft up with only a rope handrail. For me being afraid of heights getting up was okay but attempting to get down was difficult as its a sheer drop from the stairs. If you dont mind heights and have energy to climb go for it but if in doubt think about it before you get stuck at the top contemplating how to get down!"

It feels as if you entered a time long gone by. There are many such temples and I didn't see all of them but wat Arun is probably the best one. It is the most different one, no doubt. The others tend to get a bit repetitive. It is situated on an amazing location next to a river. It is visible from across the river, from boats giving many tremendous angles to view it. It is spectacularly beautiful at night, I know that from pics but I went there in day only. But one thing I learned from my trip is that such beauty cannot be captured in pics and you have to see it to experience it. "

I've been to Mexico and seen Chichen Itza and Uxmal and this rang some bells. To see the really old carvings in their current state of natural aging really gave the age away and added to the trip. There are parts that are newer, but the oldest parts of the temple were my favorite. We were there on a day when youngsters were being honored or admitted to something (we couldn't get an explanation, but stayed respectfully out of the way) and it was fun to watch. Smiles all around by proud family members so I expect that it was a big day.Definitely a must see in my book.

I always went with my Thai friends, and they said just keep walking.Do not wear skirts here if you're planning on climbing the steps. I wore a dress one day and that was a bad idea. I looked cute, but had to fidget and make sure people weren't staring at me from the bottom of the steps. It's a good workout.I've done the touristy photos in Thai clothes twice. Don't be like me and intimidated by the speed. Take a little bit of time to choose which color you want, don't let the ladies pressure you. Also make sure you get the pictures you want. I got bad pictures, but it's because I chose really bad colors for myself. They try to rush you, but if you insist on taking good pictures they will adjust to what you want. I'm intimidated and a big pushover :PIt's a very neat and beautiful temple. There are beautiful views from the top. Going in the middle of the day is not suggested, unless it's cloudy out.It has a very clean bathroom!!!!"

To get there, stop at Tha Tien Pier and take a cross river boat for only 3 baht/pax. Entrance to the temple is 50 baht/pax. To get to the 2 tiers of the temple requires climbing steep steps, but the climb was totally worth it. The view of Chao Phraya River and her surroundings was fantastic! And we could take a 360 degree view while walking round the temple on both tiers. Hence, we also had a nice view of Thonburi grounds, around the temple. Coming down from the temple was a little scarier but it was managable, with some caution. I was amazed by the tiles and mosaics that line the entire temple and stupas. Absolutely beautiful!"

Up close it has not had the same attention that the other Wat's and temples may enjoy in Bangkok. It has become a little grey and discolored, but to me that enhances it authenticity and beauty. And it is only when you start to climb the Wat Arun that you really start to appreciate its position aside the river.It is also once you start climbing the stairs that your legs start to ache and your fear of heights kick in. Try at least to get half way up, the stairs are solid, its just their angle. It like you are climbing a ladder. Up at the higher stairs there is at least a handrail. There is really no graceful way of getting down- but hey everyone is in the same position. holding onto the rail for dear life. (ha) It was a lot less crowded than the Grand Palace & reclining Buddha. there is also opportunity to \"dress up\" in traditional clothing for photos down in the gardens. We didn't have time to do it, but it looked like fun. The Wat Arun was high on my list of things to see and it did not disappoint. Sore legs aside, it is just magnificent."

You can walk up its super steep stairs for better view, but I don't recommend it if you're scared of heights.

You truly feel as though you have been transported to another land when you arrive. The first chamber you see when you first visit is very relaxing and peaceful. After exiting, you can ring the bells and then climb the towers in front of you. If you suffer from vertigo, you might think twice, but actually getting to the top of the stairs is completely worth it. The view of the Chao Phraya and its boats is very nice, but being at the temple itself and looking down the vertiginous staircase you just climbed is the best part. It is definitely worth suffering through the heat and riding the various ferries required to reach this place."

On the other hand, there were many people gathered and seated to listen to the monks chanting. We were told that this was a rare event, connected to the Chinese New Year and the chanting, together with the dark night sky, certainly added a wonderful ambience to the visit. Wat Arun itself was brightly illuminated and looked spectacular. The passing party riverboats were garish in comparison but provided an interesting contrast.

The tower stairs are steep but the climb is worth it. The temple is small and an hour should cover it. In typical asian flavor, the temple should be viewed in layers. The closer you look, the more surprises in store for you - take the porcelain decoration for example. Bangkok offers a unique cultural experience - the Temple of Dawn is a key component. Photo ops abound."

I would definitely recommend coming here at sunset time, to both avoid the heat and watch the sun set over Bangkok. Once you get to the top, you can watch the city across the river as you peer out from between the buddhist gargoyle-like figures."

I liked Wat Arun better - beautiful temples, wonderful views and less crowds. You can climb up the outside of the main temple for 50 baht via very steep staircases. The incline feels close to 90 degrees (I don't know what it really is - maybe 70?) and the climb is exciting, especially coming down. It was fun."

Follow the signs to the river taxi pier which is located on the left exit and hop onto the river cruise (should cost not more than 40baht per person). Get off at Tha Tien pier - first pier after the bridges; spot the Wat on the opposite bank or the unmissable crowd at the pier itself - and get onto the Wat Arun ferry (3baht per person). Dress appropriately to visit - covered shoes, cotton shirts for the generally blazing weather, long pants or skirts preferred and no bare shoulders would do fine. The temple halls is a great place to leave your mind behind, there will also be a monk there if you need blessings. Once you've conquered the Wat's steep steps, you'd be greeted by an amazing 360deg view around the Wat - so remember your cameras and snap away! Also note to bring along some bottled water. Plenty of touristy shops surrounding the Wat but you will find the same stuff everywhere. Dont miss the coconut guy though - his sweet cold refreshing juice is definitely a savior after the climb. To return, get onto the same ferry back to Tha Tien at another 3baht per person and your adventure continues!"

I was able to capture some great photographs of the temple without having too many people get in the way of the photos. To set the expectations from the start, you cannot enter this temple. This temple is solely for climbing purposes and to view the details of the design engraved into the stone. As mentioned in other reviews, it is a steep climb and I highly recommend you wear sneakers to climb this one. Women, you must cover your shoulders and cannot wear shorts. Gents, shorts and sneakers are fine and highly recommended as it will get very warm with the sun blazing. We went really early and managed to avoid the crowds that followed and crossed the river from the Reclining Buddha temple. I suggest going to Wat Arun first then heading over to the Reclining Buddha. You can avoid the crowds from Arun but still run into some crowds at the Reclining Buddha.Tip: If you arrive to the pier by ferry from Central Pier, you must pay 3THB to cross over to the Wat Arun side of the river and 3THB to cross back over to the Reclining Buddha side. Take bottles of water!ALSO! Read ALL signs around these tourist attraction areas. We took a photo of something and then a Thai woman appeared and pointed to a sign next to it stating we had to pay to take a photo of it."

The temple itself is not that large in width or height although it does offer a very nice view of the city. There are a few different tiers you can walk around, the top two offering nice 360 degree views (if you walk all the way around the Wat Arun). I notice people commenting on the stairs or the steep climb. Some of the climb is steep, I think it is a little misleading to say the whole thing is. There are three sets of stairs, one that sits perpendicular to the other two and two sets that go straight up the side of the temple. The first set of stairs that sits perpendicular to the other two is not steep at all, perhaps what you would find on a normal staircase. The next ascending staircase is steeper, it may make some who have height or vertigo issues a little uneasy. The last set of stairs is very steep and this may be what people are referring to. To say your body is parallel with the temple would not exactly be true but it feels like it. Again, that last set of stairs is very steep. Some of the people who I saw when I was standing at the top of the temple took one look at that last set of stairs, climbed up a couple and then climbed back down refusing to go any further. Too steep for them I guess.My wife and I went to the Wat Arun with a tour group so I do not know if they was any sort of entrance fee. A good place to go for a view and if you enjoy climbing up things that are rather steep."

            "review": "find the right way to this place!(tips). the problem is searching for the boat pier!50 baht for entrance. Reach it by boat for a short sail. This was my second time coming here.I came to this place after exploring the Grand Palace(crowded), and Wat Pho (Wat Phra). The pier for the boat to Wat Arun is Ta Thien, the pier is hidden behind market and crowded area. Using the boat will cost only 3 baht.Traveler must beware for the people that try to offer you boat trip with high price (thousands baht) and bring you to private pier (not government pier, the boat own by private owner). Also beware of tuk-tuk driver offer you small fee (10baht) ride that he said will drop you in pier to Wat Arun (but what really happened is he drop you at the private pier with high price). I experience this on my first coming to Wat Arun, but i avoid it by rejecting the private boat owner offer (although i got that 10 baht tricky tuk-tuk).tricky gang just try to take benefit from the hidden Ta Thien pier, by making tourists get confused and trick them to use the private boat. If you confused to go to Wat Arun, ask the staff in Grand Palace or staff in Wat Pho, dont just ask about the direction, but which pier you must take .Wat Arun itself is beautiful to see. The place really comfortable. You can hear the sounds from little iron that touch the body of the temple when wind comes. The building is in a very good shape. If you want to take photo in the stairs to the top of Wat Arun, just be patient (if you want to take clear photos without people behind you).the place isnt really suitable for children or senior citizen, because the stair step is high. If you go with them, just watch them carefully, especially when taking stair to goes down from the top place.There is also place selling souvenir with good price, its near the toilet area."

From Tha Tien Pier it cost 3 THB per person to cross the river towards the entrance of the temple and another 50 THB each as an entrance fee. You can also climb the wat for some great views of the river and surroundings. Surely worth a visit!"

Do take the river boat route as you can experience Chao Phraya & other beautiful landmarks along the mighty river. To get on top it cost around 500.00 baht & do climb upstairs. But the steps are quite small & ii is 90-degrees slop so do follow the UP & DOWN sign. On top is a piece of yellow cloth for anyone who one to leave marks on their visit there (I forgot to bring a pen).The temple may look creepy, dilapidated from afar because it has no gold-leaves covering but upon closer look, the colorful Chinese porcelains create a beautiful mosaics reflecting the colorful Thai history. And the view from above is AMAZING!!!TIPS: If your tour-guide takes your there & claim that the trinkets, souvenirs inside is cheap, they are RIGHT. But we were there on weekends & there are so many shoppers that day. The stalls outside of the temples also offer stuffs at the same price so do bargain around."

Furthermore, the temple gave me a South American impression whereby the middle temple was something you could climb on (big steps so watch out!). once you have climbed somewhat, you have an impressive view on the river banks and the Grand Palace at the other side of the river. If you want to get there, don\u2019t be mislead by any kind of taxi driver who wants to take you over one of the bridges, just go to the pier located next to the grand Palace and in just a few minutes and for a limited amount of money you are just in front of the Wat Arun."

The main attraction here is the chance t climb the central Prang. The stairs are quite steep and it is actually more tricky going down than up. That said it should not be difficult for any able bodied person. The Prang is fabulously decorated and by climbing it you get the chance to see this up close and also an opportunity to view wider Bangkok and the river area. The wider Wat site is nice without being anything special. Cost is 50bht. Wat Arun is a very nice site to visit. It gives the chance to get up close to the architecture and you should combine a pleasant boat trip over the river on the local ferries."

Often done in combination with a river trip, Wat Arun is a beautiful temple building on the banks of the Chao Phraya river and allows for great views and photo ops if one can be bothered to climb up the steep stairs. But do it and you'll be rewarded with a fabulous view across the river and a real feeling of spirituality and otherness...Incidentally, don't forget to buy some fish feed or bread from the old women next to the ferry walkway. Just watch what happens when you throw the bread into the river and the monstrous feeding frenzy starts below with giant catfish and other huge fish start leaping across each other for food. Fantastic!"

Though apparently I have visited there once when I was a kid according to my parents, as I did not recall it (at all nor there were pictures), this visit in January 2013 is my first experience. Always hearing friends mentioning it, I've always wanted to go to Wat Arun, but I didn't put in too much effort. But I really regret it now, because it turns out to be one of the most amazingly beautiful temples I've ever visit. On top of the Phra Prang you can see the skyline of Bangkok and the outline of the Chao Phaya river from North to South. It was a beautiful scene. Furthermore, hiking up those steep stairs are challengingly fun. Going up makes me laugh for a while. Looking down those set of steep stairs gave me a fright, and actually going down was simplier than I anticipated. Don't recommends from young kids, people with knee injuries or older people with joint problems though. Anyway, I think it's definitely worth it. Coming from a Bangkok-er"

Definitely would reccomend for anyone in Bangkok."

Spending time around Thailand and especially Bangkok you can become a bit \"templed out\", if you are trying to decide which temples to visit then this one is definitely worth it. It is different because you can climb up the outside and although the stpes are extremely steep it is well worth it. You get good views over the river and city. We paid a small fee to get in, only a few quid. It is easy to get to if yous using the main tourist boats down the river you get off opposite the temple then get a small ferry over. The building is much older than many others and is fab for photography"

Wat Arun doesn't look like much from a distance because it isn't covered in gold like almost every other monument and temple in Bangkok, but upon closer inspection anyone will appreciate the intricacies of the tile work that went into this grand temple. The views from the top are worth the steep and somewhat sketchy climb up the stairs. The boat ride across the river to the temple is also a nice experience. Another highlight is that it isn't crowded with tourists or at least it wasn't when we visited the temple. The place is lit up at night which also makes it a great place to visit near the sunset."

The entrance is 50 baht a ticket for foreigners which is a bit too high when you are paying for a whole family.

The real test awaits those who tackle the climb up to the second level.Beyond any question whatsoever, this is not for the faint-hearted.The first climb is at least 45 degrees but I'd put the angle of the second climb at closer to 70 degrees, perhaps even steeper.You can quite literally have a person climbing directly in front of you and have their feet at the same level as your eyes. It is that steep and tickets carry the legend: \"Do not dangle any doll. Do not climb the rail.\" Anyone who does must be certifiable.Climbers hang on to supports for dear life because one slip and it is an awfully long way down.The reward at the top is a chance to make a full circuit of Wat Arun, The Temple of Dawn, while enjoying views of the highest order.This site is one of the \"must visit\" attractions in Bangkok, but watch out for the entrance price of just \u00a31 because it is the only reality you will meet. Everything else is just like some fantasy adventure. Great viewing."

It is only a few Bahts to get the local ferry shuttle service from the other side of the river at Tha Thien pier which is the southern pier of the Grand Palace area.Personally I did not like the steepness of the steps at the Wat, but the view was great. My problem was not going up, but coming down as I suffer with some vertigo. I had to go down the steps backwards, and it was very stressful.

If you are afraid of heights do not look down. the view is dizzying."

You can climb very steep, tall steps for a great view of the city. The climb to the top may not be for everyone, its a little tough. You will probably have to take a boat to get here, which is fun too. Definitely add this to your list of Bangkok even if you are there for a short while."

The day we went there was some sort of celebration, chanting, talks via loudspeaker, food, etc., but we were observers only so had no clue as to what was going on. You can climb fairly steep stairs to an observation area, but the combination of heat, humidity, and overcast skies let us off the hook for the climb."

If you are confused ask the bus driver, be prepared with the temple's name written in Thai languange. When I was in Bangkok, I prefer to use public transportation because it makes me more connected to the local culture and local people. However, most of the Thai bus driver can't speak english so, it is kind of challenging to take bus if you are not familiar yet with the place you visit. But, this can be anticipated by writing all the addresses you want to visit in Thai language. Also, learning some Thai expression will be helpful to make the communication easier . Otherwise you ca just take a cab but u have to pay more...if u have unlimited budget so u can just use cabs :)"

The best way to get to Wat Arun is to take a river boat from the BTS Saphan Taksin station (either the river taxi, or hire a private long tail boat which will stop at Wat Arun.) You pay a 20 baht landing fee (for the boat to dock there). You only need about 30 minutes at Wat Arun. There's not a lot to do in the way of activities, and the actual structure you climb up is fairly limited, but it is a spectacular sight and the view from the top is amazing. As it is a temple, females must remember to wear a long skirt or pants to cover the legs. No spaghetti straps or tank tops, though they seem to be okay on t-shirts. Best to bring a sarong which you can wrap around your shorts and maybe another one for your arms. It depends on who stops you. I wore a t shirt and a sarong around my shorts to cover my legs with sneakers and they were okay about it. Men should also cover up, either with pants or a sarong over their shorts. You should wear sneakers or hiking sandals, definitely no heels! Also the ascent is extremely steep and the stairs are very narrow and thin. This is definitely not a place for anyone who is afraid of heights, and I'd also not recommend it for very pregnant women or the elderly who have knee or walking problems, as you can slip and fall on the ascent, or worse, the descent which can be challenging. If you're sporty and love hiking, it will take you 3 minutes to climb to the top. It really is a must-see and a fabulous destination for both locals and tourists. Try to make it part of the whole boat experience and Wat Arun as a stop along the way."

Good place to take photos from. You'll see Bangkok skyscrapers to the right (in the distance), Wat Pho across the river (although covered with trees) and you'll also get nice shot of Grand Palace if you have good zoom. It was breezy on the top which was also refreshing. The bathrooms next to the temple were clean and cost few BHT. Ferry back to the other side of river was also 2 BHT. It runs every 5 min.

We went this past fall (during the flooding, actually) but still found it accessible and very much worth the visit. We took the public ferry across the river. It's very cheap but a little rocky. When we got to the other side, we decided to climb up the stairs of the temple. It's steep but not too bad of a climb up. The view is great from the top. To give you an idea of how steep it is, you go down the way you came up (facing the stairs). Anyway, definitely see this temple!"

It has a great view of the city and you are allowed to climb it, with few restrictions, to partake of that view. The detail is amazing. It is inexpensive to enter this temple. Sadly, it is wearing away. Like much of the city, the acid rain that plagues it is degrading this truly beautiful site.We left on an hour long tour boat for the canals that ended up at the grand palace dock across the river. Six people for a total price of 900 baht. Not bad."

The mosaic covered Temple has fantastic statues with different facial expressions,which I noticed much to my joy. We spent a long time looking at the different ceramic plates which make up different parts of the mosaic covering the Temple. The Wat has different levels which you can stop at and gaze at the amazing views of different parts of Bangkok. The higher up you get the steeper and narrower the stairs get. I would not advise going to the top if you suffer with vertigo or have a fear of heights. However, if you have the stomach and a head for heights, the views from the top are magnificent (or so I have been informed)! The only negative I would point out, and it is a small one, is the toilet facilities at the bottom of the Wat. Plan in advice your toilet stops before reaching the Wat as the toilets are not the cleanest in the city."

Getting here is easy, you can take a taxi cab - it's located across Chao Praya River- with a really low fare."

Cheap souvenir stores, water and light snacks available on the site. It is just a short boat ride to cross to the other side where you may find the Wat Pho or theTemple of the Reclining Buddha and the Grand Palace. The sites are accessible via public transport and is cheap so do away with hiring tuktuks or locals on the streets offering boat tours. We went midday and the sun was really hot. Better to visit early in the morning or late afternoon, but check the opening and closing time on the website of the temples when scheduling your visit, some nearby temples may be closed during lunch hours."

The detail is stunning: the flowers that adorn every exterior surface are actually made from decorative pottery which was used as ballast in boats, back in the day. Close up, this feature is breathtaking. The height and shape of the different temple buildings are slender and take a little bit of effort to climb up but provide gorgeous views. Wat Arun is charming and well worth a visit during the day or the evening, when so many surfaces seem to sparkle, and I have made a point of visiting on 2 out of 3 trips to Bangkok. Beautiful."

Well worth it.If you are going after visiting the Grand Palace, you can reach the ferry in a 10 - 15 minute walk (the ferry pier is a little difficult to find, but you can take a tuk-tuk). The ferry will take you across the river for 3 baht (that's ~US $0.10) and it's fun too.Although there's a booth with a sign that says \"TICKETS\" (50 baht or US $1.60), these are voluntary; I presume they use this for maintenance, so I happily paid anyway."

Next to the temple you can find a nice market where to buy souvenirs and where you can also try to be dressed with a typical costume and make a photo in front of it."

The two piers, 8 and 9, are enough for a days adventure without too much stress and impressions.I found Wat Arun smaller, more genuine and serene, less visitors, an architecture different from the Tha Thien side and therefore a place to love and calm down a bit."

It is from a much older period and has the combination of Thai, Cambodian and Hindu culture. It is the sun temple and best visited early in the morning or later in the evening.I used public transport from Sukhmvit to get to Wat Arun. For those interested, here is the run down..Take the Sky train from Asok or Nana station( depending on where you are) to Siam. Siam is the interchange line. From Siam take the train to Central. Once you get down on Central, you are on the east side of the river. Wat Arun is on the other side. Unfortunately I haven't see a ferry that can transport you directly to the West Side. You will have to take a ferry that goes along the banks and get down at Pier 8 and for 3 bhats take a ferry that crosses across.While it seems a lot of work, the connections are pretty quick and it only takes about 35 mins. It cost about 90 bhats one way.Parents traveling with small kids might want to take turns as it is not safe to climb with the kids. Quite steep."

The view of Chao Phraya River and the city from the top of the Pagoda is stunning. You may go at Sunset or Sunrise (not sure when it opens though). Giants are the gate keepers to this vihar, your children will love them as much as they will love the Chinese figures in the Vahar area. Visiting Wat Arun before the Emerald Buddha Temple will enhance the knowledge of those who are interested in history of early Krung Thep. The temples have the same architectural style and also decorated with items from China. It's just lovely, a fun temple for the family :) Climbing up the Pagoda is challenging. It's almost as high as climbing up a pagoda in Angkor Wat. I think this is a collective culture that should be promoted for the solidarity of the region and humankind :)"

Nice wat with a beautiful view when you climb up the steep stairway.A lot of people (who are afraid of hights?) have problems when they have to go back. You dont realize how steep it is when you go up."

Never been there before, although already fifth time in Bangkok: make a better choice and go her the first time you are in Bangkok. The temple is delightfull, rather quiet if you consider that it is one that this is one of the major sights of Bangkok. Climb the steep stairs of the temple all to the top and enjoy the views over the river and (part of) Bangkok. Go with the express boat to the pier opposite of Wat Arun and take the small ferry that crosses the river (3 Bath each one way)."

Its just across the street from Wat Po, take the ferry which is only 3Baht/person and takes about 5 mins to cross Chao Phraya and you are there.It gives a fantastic view from the other side of the river, and the temple itself is also very nice. If you are able and fancy climbing the stairs, then do go all the way up. A word of caution - the steps of the stairs are really steep and it probably is harder to come down than to go up. But once you are up you get a fabulous view of the city with sky liners and the riverside, worth taking the risk and pain to clim all the way up.The entrace is only 50 Baht/person, so one should not miss. Liked it thoroughly!"

It costs 3 B per person to ferry across the Wat Pho pier to the Wat Arun station. The service operates once in about every 20 minutes or so.Entry fee is 50 B. I think it is free for Thais. There are a few souvenir shops around the ticket counter. You may be approached by a tout, we were not - maybe Indians know how to treat the touts and the locals already know about it by now. The temple can be explored in about 30 to 40 mins. The main tower of the temple is huge and you can climb up all the way to almost the top to see the Bangkok city. It is a stunning view of the river and the building of Bangkok. The walls have very detailed paints along with some cravings.At night, if you are on a river cruise, be sure when heading north, you have a look at your left to see the illuminated temple."

You can get a nice view of the river and the city from the top, just watch your step and hold on the hand rails. I find the details on the entire structure quite interesting as it has porcelain encrusted all over it. Looking up you'll see the God Indra riding a three headed elephant. There are giants supporting the main prang. I like everything about this structure simply because it describes a lot about Thai architecture, very grand and exotic.

It was beautiful looking far while on the ferry and even more beautiful when we get there. One catch is after you arrived to the wharf, walking toward Wat Arun, there are 2 faceless frames of Thai people where you can put your face in to take pictures, please don't get too excited and take photos with it because you will be rip off and charge 40baht, once your camera click there will be someone walking towards you and collect the money immediately. So beware.For people that are afraid of heights, the steps are very steep and children should not be left alone, recommended that children should not be taken up those steps because it is very dangerous. However, if you can get up all the steps, you will get an awesome view of Bangkok from the top. Be careful with all the electrical wires, some of them are exposed. Based on the previous review, getting there is very easy. Depend from where you stayed, example we stayed at Centara World, we catch the BTS skytrain from Siam station to Saphan Taksin---> get off and walk to ferry wharf and take the ferry to N8 (15baht per person) get off and catch another ferry to cross the river to WAT ARUN (3baht per person)Overall it is a must see attraction, highly recommend for everyone."

This was steep and sweaty work! There was one way up and two ways down the square tower. The tower itself was beautiful with mosaics and stones. The monks were also insightful enough to put up a graffiti wall in the highest part of the tower. Tourists do after all, like to leave little souvenirs of themselves. From the highest climbable level, the view of the river and the city was pretty impressive.The climb downward was definitely the most difficult part. It was probably a 70 degree incline. Our party tackled the going down different ways--some doing it backwards ala stepladder, some using our arms more than our feet, some at a diagonal. Going down was just as sweaty as going up but for an entirely different reason.I surmise the going up and down the temple tower must have been a test of one's will. I am not Buddhist so I really don't know but I can attest that it is truly a test of wills.Worth it? Yup, yup, yup!"

            "review": "Worth a visit: take your photo of it on the East side of the river. You can have the choice of only seeing this from a distance and avoiding the entrance fee or actually visiting it on the West side of the river. But you certainly should visit the Grand Palace, Wat Pho and the City Shrine in about three hours or so because they are all right near each other on the East side of the river. However, as I mentioned, Wat Arun is on the opposite side of the river across from the Grand Place and this will add at least an hour to your trip for a total of four hours or so to see all four attractions. As far as Wat Pho itself, there is not much to see there if you have seen a few Thai temples. However, Wat Arun offers something different than the average Thai temple: a pagoda covered in porcelain that was taken from a sunken ship. To be honest, I feel that the temple looks better from a distance. Once you get up close, however, I feel it kind of loses the magic you saw from a distance. TIPS:1. You can avoid the traffic by taking the BTS to Sapan Taksin and then get off and go down to the water's edge to take a cheap boat ride (great scenic views) to Tha Chang. Then take a ferry across the river. Ignore the touts who will try to get you to buy their boat service rather than the very cheap ferry service that the locals use. 2. Before you get on the ferry or as you are going across the river, take pictures of Wat Arun. Once you get there, it is not as easy to fit the spire of this pagoda into your pictures. 3. Be careful on the steep stairs! You are not allowed to climb all the way up anymore.4. Once you finish, take the ferry back across the river. You will get off and you will be right in the back of the Grand Palace and Wat Pho. The City Shrine where you can see the city's pillar is just across the street from these two temples. This attraction, unlike the other two I mentioned, is free. Make sure you wear formal clothes and that your feet are covered or Thai guards will not allow you in as you are. However, you will have to take your shoes off to go inside the temple where the giant Reclining Buddha is."

Steep climbs on stairs to the next level. I won't spoil the fun with more descriptions. Recommended Go. Located on the Chao Praya. You need to get on a river boat to get there. Go visit in the Morning (yes, becos it just too hot to climb the levels in the heat) Ladies, of course you need to dress decently. or be prepared to rent a Sarong to enter into the temple premises."

My Thai girlfriend wanted to go here over Songkran to make her devotions, and seeing as I needed an injection of real Thai culture, I enthusiastically agreed to this. We decided to go by taxi, me as usual at this time being a total coward and pandering to my Songkran hydrophobia, wanted to remain dry. .We crossed the Chao Phraya river by ferry (3 (or was it 30?) baht per person - a bargain) and were on the opposite bank in no time. A word to the wise though; watch out for the 'guides' (touts) trying to get you to go on an over-priced river trip! Once on the other side, we did the 'ethnic' number (well, for me anyway ... ) and dressed up in traditional Thai costume to pose for photos at 100 baht each. Well worth it, and she looked gorgeous as usual and I - well, I just looked like a total prat, but there you go. I have the photographic evidence of this, but I'm not sharing it with you lot that's for sure :-)So - the temple; well, I will let you see some photos we took as my clumsy, mere words cannot do it full justice, but seriously folks this place really is something else. More proof, were it needed, of why I love this country so much. The architecture is aesthetic eastern baroque, and almost touches the sky such is the elevation that the principal edifice attains. The carvings that adorn the exterior are intricate, highly artistic, and a fitting testament to the devotion of the Thai people to their religious beliefs. Now, for those of you who fancy themselves as ace clamberers, climbing up the precipitous steps can be a bit daunting as it's almost like going up a sheer cliff face so steep are they. But, me being me and in reasonable physical shape, myself and my companion got to the top to look out over the river and beyond. Absolutely breathtaking views of old and new Bangkok; ancient building set against the steel and glass fingers pointing upwards to a pure azure sky. Beautiful. All that said, I had to get back down again ... If you want to know what the real Thailand is all about, then Wat Arun is one of those places to visit. I cannot recommend it highly enough. A treat for the senses and the soul, this temple is truly magnificent. I know that i will go back, that's for sure."

Wat Arun is best seen from the opposite bank of the river; it glistens in the sunlight during the day and stands dark and noble at dawn or dusk. A visit to the beautiful, peaceful monastery complex surrounding the familiar towers is very worth-while.I visited Wat Arun on a weekday in April and the day was oppressivley hot but once inside the narrow streets around the temple it seemed cooler, there are many shaded and cool places a visitor can sit and contemplate the beauty of Wat Arun. The beauty of the Wat and the surrounding buildings is breathtaking and it is hard to imagine this was all built using ballast from ships. I found the staff working here to be helpful and very respectful, this is a trait found in most Thai people I had dealings with.A word of warning if you decide to climb the central prang be prepared for a very steep climb, perhaps this is not a good idea for those with vertigo. The view across the grounds of the Wat and the river are breathtaking.There are places to take refreshments in the Wat and they are moderately priced."

The entrance area, with gardens/ foyers is very pleasant. Entrance fee is 50B.Climb to the main temple (and descent thereafter) may be arduous, especially for aged persons/children.

There is a big market and bus stand there and you can cover the Grand Palace at a near distance. You can get there directly by bus or private hire as well. The gardens are open to all but the inner temple has a nominal entry fee. You can also get flowers as offering for the diety. There are a lot of photo opportunities and the river makes an amazing backdrop (try getting some pics on the boat itself with the temple behind....nice......). The main tower has different levels which run around circumfrence of the monument where you can rest during your climb up. The steps unidirectional for climbing and descending with handrails for grip.

We had visited the Grand Palace earlier in the day and Wat Arun was just a very inexpensive ferry ride across the river. There is a small charge to enter and walk up and make sure you are dressed appropriately, meaning no exposed shoulders for women and you must be wearing pants. The view from the top is very nice as you can see around the area and across the river over to the Grand Palace. It's one of the most photographed temples in Bangkok and is even featured on some of their coins. Just as a side note, there are a lot of stairs to climb, so be prepared as it can also be very hot and you must be fully dressed while visiting."

We stopped here during a boat trip along the river which is for another review...The temple is one of the temples which I\u2019d seen featured in many guide books and tourist guides so I knew that I wanted to see it for myself. The temple is very ornately decorated but one of the main attractions is to climb to the top and see the view! But be warned this is not for the faint hearted, at the top the steps are steep and I mean steep! They take a real effort to climb up to the very top level but if you can it\u2019s really really worth it! (Also if you take a Sharpee then you can sign the orange cloth at the top which thousands of others have done already)We both really enjoyed it, frankly we aren\u2019t the fittest people out there by a longshot so don\u2019t be put off from there, but it is steep and a little bit hairy if you don\u2019t like heights coming down!"

Also with a little planing you can cross the river for 14Baht versus paying a Tout boat 1000 Bant for a \"Canal\" tour. These \"tours\" are a waste of money and a complete scam best to be avoided.

Wat Arun is one of the \"big three\" that most tourists visit (along with the Grand Palace and Wat Pho). The good news is that they are all in the same area of the city. For me, Wat Arun was the most memorable. It has an odd Cambodian style to the design which made it different from anything else which I saw in Thailand. Great to climb up (note that the steps are very steep). You also get great views of the river and surrounding area. If course, everyone will have their personal preferences in terms of design. But I highly recommend that you visit this Wat if you are in Bangkok.In terms of how much time to allot, most people would probably spend an hour or 2 at this site."

As we stood on the east side of the river, those spires seemed to beckon to me. Once there, the highlights are the colorfully decorated spires themselves, as there is not a truly significant Buddha image such as the Reclining Buddha, Golden Buddha or Emerald Buddha found elsewhere in Bangkok. Once the steps are scaled that take one a good ways up the main spire, a great vantage point is gained to look out across Wat Arun, and across the river to Wat Pho and the Royal Palace. Well worth the journey."

This was a deliberate ploy as having been to the City numerous times I have always found this temple to be my favourite. The ferry ride across the river to get here costs a few Bts and the boats go from a dock close to the Temple of the reclining Buddha so its not out of the way.The big attraction is the huge central Stupa which one can climb ~ although the steps are quite steep. Some stairways are for going up - some for coming down (A fact lost on some). The views across the river back to the City are wonderfull and its nice to get some fresh air if one has been visiting the larger temples previously. I have never been here when it has been too crowded like some other temples.Outside the temple there are the usual collection of vendors selling water, pop and souvenirs and its a nice spot to stop for a dring and a rest. Certainly well worth coming across the river for."

I climbed up the steep steep staircase, and walked around the top of the temple, as far as they allow you to go that is. The details and sculptures are incredible and beautiful. There is a School of Meditation outside of the temple that children attend and you can also go at 4:30pm and meditate if you wish. Beautiful area."

I caught my ride at the popular river taxi terminal just across from the Grand Palace.Wat Arun is rather quiet and peaceful especially when compared to the Grand Palace so it might be a nice thing to do after seeing other busier sites.

You can often take pictures of the inner sanctuaries of Buddhas, but you have to do it from outdoors through a window. There are a lot of Chinese statues and painted wall murals that are interesting if you wander beyond the main tower.

The boat waits at the pier where it drops you off to see this magnificant structure. The Entracne fee for the ticket is 100 Bahts and after checking out the outer parts of the temple grounds, we proceeded to the main Temple itself. First thing that hits you is the intricate workmanship and sheer size of the temple, which by the way, is actually a pagoda, and atleast 6 to 7 stories high. (my guess ofcourse). Another thing thing you will notice very quickly is how steep the stairs are. Infact, I could only reach the first level. I woudl recommend atleast making your way up there because you will be rewarded with a wonderful view from the pagoda looking onto the Chao Prayo river and beyond. I could only imagine what a monumental sight it must have been for visitors hundreds of years ago when they would ply down the river on their boats and witness this magnificent buiding. One caution I would like to pass onto my fellow travelers is there is isn't much room to walk around and secondly, mind your steps when descending. I noticed a gentleman almost slip as he misjudged his steps. Neverthess, if you can make it to the very top then you will be greatly impressed with the view looking out. So I hear !The visit took us about 20 minutes and we walked back to the pier and found our boatman. Here you have the option of crossing the river and visiting another famous Temple the Wat Pho (Reclining Buddah) or turn back and get dropped off at the pick up place. We decided to oroceed onto Wat Pho."

The climb up the temple is scary, but worth it for the soaring views of Bangkok."

I've also found some of the friendliest locals in Bangkok there who will chat and even show you hidden places in the area.From there, if you are staying in Sukhumvit area, the really intrepid traveller can take a tuk to a major klong that will take you all the way. The photo ops along the way are fantastic and almost no-one will have done it! Ask a local how to get there"

The close-up appearance is very different from the vision you get from a distance but I found both very appealing and the contrast rewarding.You can clamber to the top up some very steep steps although coming down again is a struggle for some.The rest of the temple grounds are also well worth exploring with various structures and statues that would be worthwhile even on their own. I particularly enjoyed all the Chinese statues, many of which I didn't see in any other Wat."

Well you have to get the ferry across the river from the Imperial Palace but for starters the toilets are clean.A great photo opportunity and far quieter than the Imperial Palace.Now the steps to first and second level are at least at 50 degrees to the horizontal so not for you if you suffer from vertigono and whilst you can only climb approximately half way up the monument, the river view and surrounding area are very pleasant but not high enough to be astounding. The Buddhist idea is that you climb up on all fours and approach God with a bowed head and carefully. It is a physical depiction of humility and it works. You have also achieved something on the short climb. No one too old to make this short climb just reasonable fitness and a slow pace required. There are handrails and your hands can reach both of them, but expect to use both hands to cling to one of them! Being tall is no advantage here. The same applies to coming down but you do it backwards (far safer) looking at your feet, one step at a time, and a little like Christ, carefully as it safer to arrive intact albeit slowly. Some good stalls at the bottom right next to the jetty but you have to get across to the East bank of The Chao Phraya to catch the express or Tourist Ferry."

You can climb up three secrtions, with the steps getting steeper and steeper to symbolise the increasing difficulty of making spiritual advance. The carvings are astonishing and the atmosphere impressive. However, do be careful over the price of water, if you are going to be thirsty, take some with you.

Then you find the Up Stairs (do not climb up the Down stairs as I did once!) and hold on tightly to the rail. Prepare for a very steep climb. Hold on tightly to the rail and climb slowly and carefully. You will be rewarded with a great view and usually a nice breeze at the top viewing area. You have a great view of the Chao Praya River and the Temples on the other side of the river and the surrounding modern and ancient architecture mixed together. After enjoying the view and taking photos, take the Down stairs set slowly and surely, but be careful looking down at the precarious steep steps below you epecially if you have a fear of heights! The steps are STEEP and a challenge if you have knee or ankle or hip problems. IT IS NOT FOR CHILDREN! The steps are actually too high and steep, and one could literally die if you fell from the high steps. You must hold on to the railing. If you are not in decent cardiovascular shape you must go slowly or abstain.In addition there are nice shops which have some decent souveniers on the grounds. There are also vendors who sell ice cold Cokes or Coke Zeros and Magnum Ice Cream Bars, etc. which are much appreciated after a climb in the humid Bangkok heat."

Wat Arun is best seen from the opposite bank of the river; it glistens in the sunlight during the day and stands dark and noble at dawn or dusk. A visit to the beautiful, peaceful monastery complex surrounding the familiar towers is very worth-while. These towers, the \"Phra Prang,\" although best known, the only part of Wat Arun. It also contains narrow lanes; elegant, old white buildings; shrines, pools of turtles;and two fine giants, \" Yuk Wat Jaeng,\" mortal enemies of the \" Yuk Wat Po\" across the river. Wat Arun figures in one of Thailand's most colorful festival, the Royal Tod Kathin. Then His Majesty the King travels down the river in a procession of Royal barges to present new robes to the monks after their three-month lent period."

If you can make it to the top, do it. Great view.Leg and shoulder coverings are supplied at entrance for a small fee.Ticket price is worth it.Dont miss even if you cant climb to top."

It is one of my favourite tourist sites - a beautiful outdoor structure decorated with colourful pieces of ceramics. Bring a hat as it can get very hot. The climb up (from any of the 4 sides) is challenging. I suffer from fear of heights so I usually stand below while my guests and sons negotiate the steep narrow stairs. I climbed up once and found that coming down 'backwards' (i.e. facing the steps) helped. It's a nice view of the Chao Phaya River from the top.The entrance fee for an adult is Bath 50 and children go free. There is a market selling souvenirs next to it. You can rent a Thai costume and have your picture taken on your way to/from the pier.To get there, from Pier N8 (Tha Tien), take a small boat which marks 'Tha Tien-Wat Arun-Tha Tien', costs only Baht 3 one way once you pass the turnstiles. To get to Tha Tien Pier, depending on where you are coming from, I usually take the BTS all the way to Saphan Taksin BTS station and take a tourist boat (going right - upstream) costing Baht 25 per adult from the Saphan Taksin pier just next to the Saphan Taksin BTS station. Tickets may be purchased onboard."

The grounds are meticulously maintained, the environment serene, the temples well cared for and the fact that the site is on the river provides a cool breeze and great backdrop for exploring and contemplation. The biggest attraction to this site has to be the giant main pillar temple which rises 75 meters. Constructed out of stone and adorned with ceramic and shell pieces, this climable temple not is not only an attraction but provides brilliant views of the river and distant downtown core of Bangkok. You can also negotiate inexpensive hour long boat excursions and book tours through the ITAT government site. Wat Arun also offers a foreigner-friendly mediation program in English which you can inquire about while you're there. Getting to Wat Arun is very easy. Just walk across the street from Wat Phra Kaew to the ferry terminal. By-pass all of the tour operators go to the end of the terminal, hang a right then a left and you'll see the ferry entrance. 3 bhat gets you across and another 3 to get back. An absolute must see when you're in Bankok!"

When the sky turns dark, the lights turn on at the temple which make it a beautiful place for night snapshot of photos. The temple is always open for public, so do not believe if someone come to you on the street and tell you that \"the temple is only open today, once in 500 years\", you might be tempted to visit since the local said so and you will be paying THB 2000 per person for the so called \"special discount ride\". There is no such thing, so just be aware of what local said.

Apparently there's lots of scams that go on around most of the Wat trying to lead tourists away from the Wat, saying its closed etc or trying to direct you for a boat trip on their friends boat. Dont listen to the scammers!! Just smile and walk away if someone seems too friendly, they are!We made the trip across the river to see the Wat, definitely worth seeing! It wasn't as busy as some of the other Wats we visited, I think due to the fact its slightly out of the way, not as easy to get to as some of the others, but its just a short taxi/tuk tuk boat ride away!Again, you can spend quite a while wandering about and seeing all the artifacts, but its definitely worth climibing up to see the view across the river from the top!"

You really need the sun to be out to experience all the gold glinting, and the gentle sound of the tiny bells ringing all over the site. You also need to be reasonably fit and steady on your feet to climb the steep stairs to the top - the view is well worth it.

Every surface is dotted with individually crafted pieces: glazed plates, flowers, leaves, and other shapes, some coloured, some patterned.

Don't make the mistake of getting on the Express Boat (which operates from another pier at the same terminal) by mistake! Wat Arun is a very beautiful \"temple mount\" spire and the climb up the very steep steps is rewarded by stunning views across the river and city as well as a cooling breeze.Be aware; the steps are very steep, almost like a ladder and once youre up you have to get back down as well!"

Upon arriving, there were GIANT fish you could feed... so bring some small bills/change to get some food. I know this seems stupid, but it was a lot of fun. We walked around this gorgeous temple towards the end of the day so we were tired. It had great views of the river and a variety of interesting areas to walk around.One of the things I wish I knew in advance was that climbing the temple was difficult. It was extremely steep AND slippery. Make sure to wear some sneakers to get up there. I had walked around in sandals all day to get into and out of the temples easily. It backfired here.There were some services going on that were very cool to witness. There were also a few \"scam\" artists on the way in so just keep walking! Enjoy!"

We were picked up by our Thailand International Tours\u2019 driver shortly after breakfast, and arrived when the temple was still quiet. Wat Arun is one of the best known landmarks in Bangkok, and easily recognized with the high pagoda in the centre which is almost 100m. It is possible to climb the prang, using some very steep steps, to two terraces giving excellent views. Your legs will surely burn the next day!! Phra Prang is decorated with a mosaic of multi-coloured Chinese porcelain, which surely adds to its majestic beauty. The decoration reminded me of some of The Taj Mahal in fact. The outer four corners hold statues of the God of the Wind or Phra Phai.This temple is classified as a principal class Royal temple. It is a fairly old temple, being built in the days of Thailand's ancient capital of Ayutthaya and originally known as Wat Makok. It has changed its name a few times. King Thaksin changed the name to Wat Chaeng. King Rama II restored the temple and gave it a new name as Wat Arunratchatharam. King Rama IV also made some additional restorations and again changed the temple's name to the present one as Wat Arunratchawararam. However the most famous name is Wat Arun or the Temple of Dawn.Wat Arun is best viewed at sunset if viewed from the Bangkok side of the river. Take a boat trip on the Chao Phaya when you are next in Bangkok, and make sure you visit Wat Arun, you will not be disappointed. Alternatively, there are several restaurants and coffee shops across the river which make fine viewpoints of the temple. Probably a good idea is to take in the magical sights of Wat Pho, and the Grand Palace on the same trip, and if you have the legs for it, perhaps Wat Pho all in the same trip.It was an impressive day for all the members of our group, and a big thanks must go to Thailand International Tours for their professional organisation throughout the whole day."

They might take a candid shot of you, but don't be too afraid, they will make a nice decorative porcelain plate with your face on the center, just wait couple of minutes, and the cool souvenirs is done. They will charge you for about 100 bahts if you want to get the plate, but if you don't, that will be ok, they will let you enjoy the rest of the temple. Well I can say the front yard is the 1st best photograph spot in this area, I suggest take about 10 minutes enjoy the scenery there, take photograph as much as you can. As you enter The Temple you'll see many statues figuring Budddha, just like other Budhist religious site. Some of the statues covered with gold finished, I'm not sure if thoose are real 24K gold plated. The temple is Pagoda shaped, and the largest one lies in the center, this also the highest buildings in the temple. I didn't know exactly what is the main materials of the temple, while the solid cement concreted wall covered with mozaic piece of colorful ceramics as the finishing touch looks very stunning and beatiful. I agree with many review before me, is quite difficult to climb up to the top level, either when you climb down. The stairway are very steep, although they provide steel handle along the way up, you must very very careful. Just don't be afraid of that, if you like to dare yourself , just try to climb up to the top level, no matter how hard it is, your sweat won't be wasted, there are a very worth stunning views waiting for you up there. This is the 2nd best spot in Wat Arun for me, take about 10 - 15 minutes there, enjoy the scenery while you can resting, you'll see The Grand Place on east side accros Chao Praya river and the shadow of bangkok's busy sourrounding. Before leaving, if you still want to buy some souvenirs, t-shirts, hats, and etc there are several small store inside the temple area. Once Again, I found Indonesian language there, many of them can't speak english well, but Bahasa Indonesia is more popullar. They wrote down a label with Bahasa, like \" Diskon \" in english we said \" Sale \" , \" semua kaos sablon putih @ 99 bahts \" in english \" all white printed t-shirts @ 99 bahts \", how nice is that, they will give more discount if you buy up to 5 pieces. Bargaining is OK, but just ask them to lower the price 5-10 bahts. Sun block cream, hats and sun glasses is necessary. If you plant to get on the top floor, prepare your shoes, especially after rain the stairway can be slick, you do not need to hurry, just take it easy and slowly, be safe. Bangkok can be very hot in mid day, you'll always get thirsty, I suggest bring enough drinking water. As we must put respect to this sacred place, do not ever try to get in there wearing short pants or mini skirt, tank top or sleeveless, wear a proper dress. We must obey the rules, mean while they will charge you 20 bahts for renting \" Sarong \" , you will need it to cover up your bottom piece if you wear short or mini skirt and still want to get in. :) :) :)"

You can buy a ticket for a \"tourist\" boat which is 30baht. Or you can just stand inline and wait for a semi-express \"local\" boat (with yellow flags) heading up the river. After the boat departed, they will ask you for the fare, which is 15baht.Once you get to Tha Tien and disembark, you just walk up the dock around to the right and pay 3baht (yes, 3!) to board another boat to cross the river to the other side where Wat Arun is.To go back, you just reverse the trip.I would not buy anything at the Wat. It's over-priced! You can get food/drinks back at Tha Tien dock at better prices (or bring your own)."

You will need to wear attires covering your shoulders (t-shirt will do) and covering your legs too. No short skirts and pants allowed especially got girls. If not you will need to pay 100baht for the attire rental (rental only) So be prepared! There are shops around but their price is pretty high and unwilling to negotiate, so don't suggest to buy anything there. The temple is pretty unique if it's your first time visits and those girls who are very long skirts even climbing the stairs is pretty hard for them. Basically i saw a few man peeking up at them because the climbing was really steep! After visiting the temple, do try and go to the corner and search for this noodle store which is quite tasty too! It's 50baht per bowl but it's delicious. Unless you're dying for water or coconut juice, i suggest you don't buy from there too. Bring your own water because across the river at Tha Tien station there's a mini market which sells cheaper stuff and cheaper drinks and coconut especially!"

This temple is breathtaking, and its not hard to reach just using a public boat at 3 bath one way per person. But at that moment the weather is really hot so me and my friend not climb until the top only see from the close. But is amazing to see some tiny porcelain put together and become that temple. It is really beautiful, absolutely recommended."

Best way is go there is to take the boat ferry for 3THB from nearby the Grand Palace. I would recommend to take the boat tour on the Chao Phraya River. The boat tour takes you to canals where still people live nearby the canal. It reminded me a bit of Amsterdam."

Not recommended at all for those who have phobia of heights. The temple ground is maintained and clean. However, I'd rather disappointed to see that many of the paints are faded. The difference is very noticeable on how the temples and building inside Grand Palace complex have colourful hues while the one at Wat Arun is left to be desired.For 50 bath, I felt it was rather more value for money to go to Wat Pho (which has same entrance fee) instead.Facilities>>Bathroom are located outside the temple ground.

By day, we visited the grounds and took our time visiting the buildings and climbing the central monument. We went to Tha Tien pier and then took the ferry over directly to Wat Arun for only 20 baht each. The entrance fee for tourists to the Wat is 50 baht each. The Wat is open from 7am to 5 pm daily. Please remember men need to wear long pants and women need to wear pants or skirts that cover to just below the knee, shirts that cover the shoulders and back and shoes that cover the ankles and toes, (ie no flips flops!)The stairs on the central prang are very steep and one must be very careful when climbing and descending. the steep stairs do have meaning though- they represent the difficulties of reaching higher levels of existence. The view of the Chao Phraya river and the rest of the grounds is very beautiful when you do get up there. Also, the popular view of Wat Aurn, as seen from the river appears on the ten baht coin. there are 4 other minor prangs that flag the central prang.It is amazing as you walk around the grounds and look closely at all the prangs and see all the small pieces of ceramics and porcelain that were used to complete this amazing temple.If you get a chance to see this exquisite beauty lit up at night like we did on our river cruise, take the chance, it is incredible."

While wandering the streets of Bangkok near the Grand Palace, we came upon a woman offering boat rides on a pier at the end of an alley. We figured what the heck, and hired a boat for a tour of the canals and a stop-off at Wat Arun (1000 bhat for the 3 of us, definitely negotiable). It turned out to be a fantastic way to get to see some wildlife (numerous monitor lizards, fish, etc.) and experience a less well-known part of the city. Wat Arun, I believe a Khmer-era temple, is beautiful and worth climbing up the dizzying stairs for a good view of the city. There are also some gardens with a few impressive statues around the temple and of course the ubiquitous shop selling cold drinks and trinkets (also bathrooms!). Admission is a modest fee, and non-natives are encouraged (required?) to wear appropriate clothing as this is a sacred site. I believe there are options to see other sites from these boats including the Snake Farm, where they make antivenin, but we didn't partake."

            "review": "Definitely worth the cross-river trip. The Wat Arun or Temple of the Dawn is located at the west side of the Chao Phraya River. To get there, take a cross-river ferry from the Wat Pho stop (Tha Tien N8). The ferry takes off every fifteen minutes or so, and costs about THB4 per person one way. The ferry operates from six o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock in the evening daily.The dress code for visiting Thai temples applies in Wat Arun, which means no shorts, mini-skirts, tight-fitting trousers, tights, sleeveless shirts, see-through shirts, sweatshirts and sweatpants, quarter-length trousers, and sandals without ankle or heel straps. Better bring socks just in case because bare feet is not allowed. All shirt sleeves also cannot be rolled up.Although there are various structures of note in the Wat Arun complex, such as Wat Mahathat, which is one of the six royal temples of the highest class and was built during the Ayutthaya period, the central prang of Wat Arun is the main highlight of the trip. There is a fee of THB20 per person to enter the prang compound. Be prepared for a steep climb up the central prang -- those who have fear of heights should not attempt to go all the way to the top lest they are unable to go back down. The steps get narrower as you get higher up the prang, but even the halfway mark shows you breathtaking views of the river."

As others mentioned you can easily reach this Wat via a ferry from the other side which costs only cents, the entrance is also pretty cheap and while it looks pretty impressing from the other side of the river (or the public transport boats, stronly recommend them for getting around in Bangkok, no jams) it is also fully worthwhile to see it up close.As most Wats in Thailand is is full of statues, full of decorations and colours and also full of details. Some general knowledge of the religion and culture will enhance your visit there greatly so you can identify better what is what. The climb up is pretty steep and narrow (as well as the climb down) and in the Bangkok heat and humidity this can be exhausting and you need to be able to use such stairs (think ladders). The view from up over Bangkok even to the grand palace is pretty much worth it anyway. It is different from the other Wats in Bangkok, no big central Buddha, more of the Camobodchian (khmer) style so you have a unique thing to see here. All in all you can have a good visit in about one hour so if you are at Wat Po and Grand Palace it can be easily included.P.S. As somebody already mentioned, the grand palace is always open so if somebody approaches you telling otherwise he is trying to scam money from you."

Yes, the view from across the river is fantastic, but so are the views from the temple. Moreover, the Wat is unusually high (about 104 or so meters high according to the Thai Tourism board), and you can climb it up through rather narrow steep steps. The views even climbing half way are fabulous. The structure itself is worth seeing up close. Don't miss it. We went on the Express Boat on the river, up and down, and made several stops, but our destination from the start was the Wat Arun, and don't regret it. We paid about 20 bath to enter, and 2 bath per person each way to cross the river from the Express boat stop on the other bank. You can go easily across the river to see Wat Arun when you visit the Grand Palace, which unlike another review mention is NOT closed on Wednesday or any day for that matter. The people who tell you that the Palace or Wat Pho are closed (even temporarily closed) are just scammers trying to redirect you (and transport you for a fee) to another place. Please don't pay attention!"

There are only two (2) legitimate entrances to the temple grounds\u2014one each on the East side and West side. There are warning signs not to pay anybody who approaches you.Caught a ferry from Central Pier (East side of river) for 14 Baht ($.45 US) and rode it about 7 stops to Ta Wang Lang (West side of river). Then, I walked due south on a road parallel to the river, followed the signs to the temple grounds. Taking my time, it took about an hour and some of the streets were a little questionable. Instead, cross by another ferry from Tha Tien Pier (East side of the river) adjacent to Wat Pho temple. It only costs 3 Baht ($.10 US) to cross the river. Arrived at approximately 1700 and was amazed at how empty it was. Maybe 10 other people wandering the grounds. There was a family with 3 children under the age 10, but I would not recommend climbing for anybody under 13 years and those afraid of heights. Beautiful artwork and amazing construction done with fairly primitive technology. This is the type of cultural site that one expects to see in Thailand. Wish there were more signs or a handout to help explain the significance of site.There are 2 fairly steep flights of steps going up and another set of stairs going down. As soon as I entered the grounds, it started to rain, but I still climbed the steps. There are steel rails on each side of the stairs, but recommend using both hands on just one side of rails. Going up was challenging, but coming down was borderline scary. On the way down, I highly recommend you walk down the stairs backwards, using both hands on a single rail. Found it easier to control my center of gravity because if you feel as if you are going to fall, you can just lay on your stomach or drop to your knees. Glad I made the trip, but climbing to the top would be a challenge for the majority of my relatives. Even if they did not actually climb it, it would be worth the 50 Baht to just walk around the temple grounds. Of course, when I attempted to buy a ferry ticket at the Central Pier, was told my only choice was to buy an all day pass for 150 Baht ($4.88 US). Having fallen for that trick on my last trip, told them I only wanted a one way ticket. Surprise, but he still my only choice was 150 Baht even though the tourist standing right next to me was charged 35 Baht. Just buy the ticket on the ferry for 14 Baht ($.45 US). Have no problem paying the fair price, just hate being cheated. Where are the Tourist Police when you need them?"

The towers are decorated by seashells, porcelain and ceramics and fashioned into an array of flowers and other images. The central prang is topped with a seven-pronged trident.If you visiting the river by the water taxi you will need to take a separate taxi to go across the river. There are steep steps that you can climb and enjoy the views of the city. However on the day we visited the weather was so hot, we opted to have a fresh coconut drink instead and watch others struggle to reach the top."

It is so worth the climb to the top, as the views of the city skyline, the river and the Grand Palace are wonderful. One tip --- it\u2019s a very steep climb, so coming down, you\u2019re better off going backwards. You\u2019ll want to use the hand rails in both directions!"

The craftmanship is amazing. It was very ornate. The view was breath taking once you make it up the steep stairs. Walking down those stairs was very scary. It was steep. I don't recommend walking up the temple for anyone who is afraid of heights and with bad knees/hips."

Directions: If u are visitng wat pho. Face the entrance of wat pho. Turn to your right and keep walking straight. You just have to cross one street and then go through this alleyway passing stalls selling spices and dried fish. Catch the ferry to wat arun is a 2 min ride across the river. Price: You have to pay 3 baht to go there and when you are on the other side 3 baht to come back. Entrance fee is 50 bahtI found the temple beautiful and loved the architecture. Once on top there is a cool view of the river and grand palace."

If you are not planning on other stops along the Chao Phraya River, the best way to do is to go to end of BTS station (Silom Line) -- Saphan Taskin station and take any of the free hotel shuttle (Mandarin Oriental is probably best). Get to the other side of the river and then take a taxi. If you use the Chao Phraya River Tourist boat, it is a long wait for the boat and then when you get to Tha Tien ferry pier, you still need to take another ferry to Wat Arun.Make sure you are wearing proper shoes so that you can climb all the way up to Wat Arun and then see the view from the wat. It is truly beautiful."

Got there quite easily on the tourist Chao Praya River boat on a day ticket that is now BAHT150 for the day. You get off at stop 8, or Tha Tien Pier, you then get on another smaller boat to take you to Wat Arun. Remember to have your BAHT3 ready each way as this is what you have to pay before getting on the cross river boat. It cost BAHT50 to get into the temple. If your clothing is not deemed appropriate there are shawls to rent at BAHT20 with a BAHT100 deposit. I am aware that there are cheaper boats to get you to Wat Arun but this is what we did.The temple was looking its best and in a particular WAT a man was completing one of the columns with some fine detail. The others had been completed and looked beautiful. We saw many people take the walk up the steps and it was a reminder to us to take it easy. It was 32degrees celcius at about 10:30am and the possibility of falling and hurting yourself was there. But if you take it easy and pace yourself you will be fine. We took our time but saw lots of people rushing about. We read up on the history before we went and read up again when we returned as you get a better understanding as there is soooo much to take in.Enjoy Wat Arun. We certainly did."

This is one of the three must-see temples in Bangkok, and can easily be combined with Wat Pho and Wat Phra Kaew (in the Grand Palace complex). If you only have 1 day in Bangkok, I suggest that you finish all three, and you're good to go! Wat Arun is the most photographed structure in Bangkok (especially during sunset), and understandably so. It is simply gorgeous up close and from afar. I took the Chao Phraya \"cross river\" ferry from the Wat Pho stop. The maps for Chao Phraya is everywhere in Bangkok so it's impossible to miss this. I also have my Lonely Planet: Thailand book which has good recommendations on walking tours, which includes this temple. When you enter the Wat Arun compound, you'll be amazed by its stunning design. It's simply majestic! And, you get to climb the temple too. Be careful though, the stairs are pretty narrow, and steep. However, your effort climbing up won't be left unrewarded. The views from the top is amazing and gives you a panoramic view of the Chao Phraya river and the old Bangkok. This temple should definitely be a part of any itinerary in Bangkok!"

Wat Arun is a historic landmark in a very huslte-bustle Bangkok city. It reflects the spirituality of Bangkok's people.There so many things to do in Wat Arun's Area which are (of course visiting the main temple), climb so many stairs to reach the upper storey of the temple and enjoy the view over there, and shopping various Thai souvenirs or foods in the area. We can find so many cheap but nice things in Thailand ~ also in Wat Arun. I bought a pair of wallet made from stingray leather, it costed me only 250 Baht (Approx. 9-10 USD) and if you are a good bargainer (and i'm not) maybe you can get lower prices than that.There was a bad experience happened during my visit to Wat Arun. All travelers especially foreigner should be aware of some irresponsible local people. In my case, I happened to be tricked with my money ~ when i wanted to pay the bill about 100 Bath (I took a photograph with a Sriraka statue and i haven't got any idea if should pay for that, they put so tiny sign about the prices so that if we weren't aware, we could not see it... geez) and opened my wallet, they took my money 100 dollars but they took the Singaopore dollars not the Thai Baths. I had a little argument with them and at last then they returned the money and i gave the real bath (100 SGD = 2000 THB).So to all travelers, enjoy your visit to Wat Arun and also be aware of yourselves. Eventhough, Thailand is still the land with smiles.( ' ' )V"

            "review": "Watch those stairs!. This is a great Wat to see up close. From afar, its very majestic and probably the most iconic image of Bangkok. To get there, simply take the Tha Tian express ferry across the Chao Phraya river. It will drop you off directly in-front of the Wat. There is an entry fee for non-Thais. Wat Arun is simply a sight for the senses. Look up close to the bits and pieces of the Wat - they are decorated by seashells and bits of porcelain which had previously been used as ballast by boats coming to Bangkok from China. They form many images - many of them floral in shape. You can easily climb up half way without much of a problem. However, if you want to go to the top, be warned, the stairs are narrow and steep! Going up isn't so much the issue, it's coming down. So please secure all lose bags and make sure those shoe laces are tied! It's a nasty fall. The views are very lovely and it makes the climb up all that much more worthwhile.If you do a dinner cruise along the river, you will see the Wat all lit up - and it looks quite pretty! This Wat is quite a nice change from all the glitz and gold from some of the other Wats in Bangkok."

The temple is made from 1000's of pieces of broken porcelain. It is a small temple and no more than 30 minutes is needed to see it all.Although shorts are allowed, women must cover their shoulders. My wife just tied a shirt around her neck and draped it over her shoulders."

It\u2019s a pity more people don\u2019t visit it.Not a typical temple in the Thai style, which is quite refreshing if you\u2019ve been in Thailand for a while. It consists of a central prang with stairs up to two levels. There are four smaller prangs at the corners. There is no temple building with a Buddha image inside, so no need to remove shoes at any time.Broken pieces of porcelain and small bowls are used to decorate the temple so it\u2019s certainly colourful with lots of demon \u2018yaksha\u2019 figures for decoration.Be warned the steps are very, very steep to climb to the two levels. They are supposed to symbolise the difficulty of ascending to the heavens."
