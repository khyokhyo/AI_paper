You can use your octopus card to get in, fairly inexpensive, and have a blast drinking beer and eating juicy hot dogs and delicious curly fries.We didn't bet on the horses as we'd never been to a horse derby before, but there were many people that did and it was still super exciting to watch. Also, of note, casual dress is not a thing here. Many men were wearing suits and women hats and dresses."

Then, it is a place where fortunes are made or broken up. It is not the Jockey Club's policy to encourage gambling. But, Chinese are fond of gambling and most people don't see it as a high society activity. I wish you the best of luck!"

Very interesting was the positioning of the pharmacy in the clinic. We were lucky to be shown round by a Kiwi who is a very important part of the racing industry in Hong Kong and this made it much more personal.

And what a place it is: well-maintained grounds surrounded by gorgeous skyscrapers as handsome horses run past, you realize just how good you have it living in Hong Kong. Sure, you can place bets and hopefully win some cash. But I enjoy being more of a non-invested spectator who hangs out near the beer garden, soaking up the incredibly buzzy atmosphere. The best part? Admission is a nominal $10HKD and can be paid simply by swiping your Octopus card."

We were fortunate enough to be in Hong Kong for the Last race meeting of the season and what night. The track was packed with lots go people not just to gamble but to party. It was great the atmosphere was electric and the horse races were great to watch. $10HK to get in and min bet $20HK. We came out winning (Grinning). There is plenty go food and refreshment outlets including McDonald's to eat and drink at. Seating is sparse but you can find a seat if your patient. They had lots of entertainment off the field as was and it was one big party night. Would definitely recommend it to the party goer or gambler. Just check the dates of the races as the season stops between July and October."

The facilities, the atmosphere and quality of racing was phenomenal. I was mesmerised by the size of the grandstands plus the fact it's in the middle of the city. The service they provide is second to none particularly the betting agents taking your bet, before handing over your ticket & taking the money they make sure you've made the correct selections by politely pointing out your selection & wager. Australia could learn a lot from the Hong Kong Jockey Club on how to conduct a race meeting. Everyone there was having a great night whether it be the expats meeting up for a night of fun or the local punters doing some serious punting! The whole atmosphere was electric.This is a must do when visiting Hong Kong!"

As a racing enthusiast, this place has been on my bucket list for a long time, and I wasn't disappointed!We attended the bank holiday racing day, on Thursday 9th June, 10 races from 1pm through to 6pm! Normally it's a Wednesday evening with fewer races.There was a mix of tourists, locals and hardened gamblers mixing easily - beware that seats, corners and spaces are reserved early by people leaving their marked up newspapers (like a beach towel on a deck chair!), bags, food and drink and so on, as we found out when we sat down in the stand - but the locals were fairly easy going, so it's no biggie to find a space. And as I found as a taller westerner, there are plenty of great vantage points that allow one to overlook the locals and get a great view of the track.We had the choice of paying 10 HKD for general entrance (what would be similar to 'silver ring' in the UK), or entrance as a tourist. You pay more as a tourist - 130 HKD per person when we went - but you get to enter by gate E, in the members area.NOTE - if you are entering on a 'T' Tourist badge:- you need to take your passport (just the passport); and- gentlemen need to wear trousers or long shorts, covering the kneesMy host had short shorts, and there was a bit of commotion due to his 'offensive knees' but the management found him a pair of trousers to wear!If you go in as a tourist, you may also want to consider getting there early and going up to the second floor bar where you can bag a restaurant table overlooking the racetrack. There is a further 40 HKD walk in fee for that bar, so it adds up but it looked pretty comfy.We found that entering as a tourist gave us access to slightly less crowded facilities, you get better access to the parade/saddling areas, can get really close to the winning line - and as I found out, really close to the jockeys, connections and behind the scenes - probably too close as security gently ushered me away when I almost ended up in the jockeys dressing room trying to find my way back!!!The facilities in the members area were fairly good and there was food and drinks, but if you just want to go for cheap eats, beers and racing, then maybe the general area is for you.Betting is via a pool system at windows - it's bets to get a bet on in good time so you can get a good vantage point for the race. The staff had enough English to help even the relative novice to betting so just go to the window and ask for the bet you want and they should be able to help you. Use race card number, rather than the name of the horse.I managed to describe a reverse forecast which turns out to be a 'quinella' which you do as a place bet as well...there are all manner of exotic bets that I might look in to next time.Toward the end of the day's racing, we wandered (you can get back and forth on the tourist badge) in to the general area - there were plenty of covered seats, pop up bars, and music - so it was a great day out either way. You won't be disappointed if you just want to enter via the general entrance for a good days racing.I can't wait to go again!"

If you do not fancy being in the betting ring then all hotels offer hospitality packages including a meal, transport and at table betting.

Recently, I have installed an App of the Jockey Club, so that I can bet with my i-phone, After the installation, I got a gift and they send me free tickets to see the Happy Valley Racecourse (Wednesdays). It's so excited of seeing the horses so close. Also, they have different themes from time to time. While watching the races, you can enjoy the good foods and wines. Last month was Korean and this month is French May. There're performances and games as well. it's not just betting but likes partying. I usually left early (before the last race at 10:30 pm), as the traffic is very congested after the races."

I enjoyed this very much. and also a great excuse to gamble a little."

The betting system was clearly explained and started from HK$10. The balcony gave good access to the course atmosphere with additional views of night time Hong Kong.

(However there are different options to get up to one of the booth among the VIP if you have a Jockey Club member friend to take you in or you are willing to pay ca. 500 HKD.) Even if you go as a tourist you will find a lots of expacts to have a conversation - we did run into Hungarain visitors after 15 minutes already ;) Do gamble a little and cheer your selected horse! The minimum bet is 10 HKD, bet for 'Place' meaning you bet the horse is going to be within the first three. Get the magazine to read special information and tips on horses in English.

Bets can only be placed at the official Jockey Club booths, but having a flutter is easy and there's no need to wager high roller stakes, so the amount you spend is entirely up to you. Watch the race from trackside to get a feel for the power and speed of the horses or from the elevated seating to see the whole of the race unfold; and don't forget to shout encouragement to your horse and rider, everybody else will be cheering for theirs!"

I tried one taxi and the driver just said \"No\" and drove off so it was a long walk from Tsim Sha Tsui but we probably got there faster walking than if we had taken a taxi. When we were almost to Happy Valley we discovered we could have caught a bus or tram.It only cost 10 HKD to enter and you can use your Octopus card.My son and I had never been to a horse race before so this was a very new and fun experience for us. It had quite a festive atmosphere - food booths, a live band and a real mix of people milling about, along the fence and in the stands. Inside (where you place your bets) there are monitors and other food concessions - though we didn't get why so many guys wanted to sit inside watching the race on the monitors instead of outside watching the actual race. We made a few 20 HKD bets (I think that is the smallest you can make) - we knew nothing about horse racing, we just picked names that we liked. My husband showed us how to fill out betting form and the cashier helped as well. My son's horse did place second so he won 17.50 HKD which is about $2 USD. So you can have fun without breaking the bank.The starting gate was moved around so sometimes the race started on the far side of the track (away from the viewing stands) and sometimes the starting gate was right in front of the viewing stand which was a LOT of fun to see. I wish I had brought a small pair of binoculars.I think the first race was at 6:15 and went every half hour. The last race was at 10:15 or 10:45pm, not sure as we left after the 9:45pm race. Fun evening. We caught a tram outside the gate (a little ways down the street) to get back to our hotel."

Dinner was served in a fantastic viewing room which provided a panoramic outlook of the course and surrounds. Betting was also available in that area.

I suggest you get involved in the betting as the betting minimums are very low. They sell programs if you are familiar with how to read them. If you have no idea what you are doing, just put a couple bucks on a horse with good odds to place (finish in the top 3). You won't win much, but you'll have a high percentage play.

The food in this bar looked delicious but we stuck with cocktails. It was a fantastic experience and is not expensive to do; much mor atmosphere than most UK racecourses. BUT, we were refused a taxi from HK Island to our hotel in Monkok by more than fifty drivers whose reaction to us was as if we had asked to be taken to the end of the world!!

The fun and excitement was apparent from the moment we walked in. The facility is huge and quite a lot to take in. We were fortunate to be hosted by a member of the Hong Kong Jockey Club which afforded us the opportunity to partake in a splendid dinner during the races. The restaurant served delicious entrees while the rest of the meal was buffet style. Enjoying the entire experience in an air conditioned space with TV monitors providing data on the horses, races, odds, etc. was great fun. The member\u2019s restaurant has an outdoor balcony from which the real thrill of horse racing can be experienced: the up-close-and personal thudding of twelve thoroughbreds roaring past\u2026very exciting. Betting is easy \u2013 just fill out a simple form with details of the particular race, take it to the counter where it is processed, pay your money, get your stub, and then hope for the best. Minimum bets are only $10 HKD which, at the time of our visit, amounted to only about $1.30 USD at the time of our visit. If one isn\u2019t able to use the members facilities, general admission is also available but without the amenities and dress code. Given Hong Kong\u2019s racing history and the Asian tradition of enjoying gambling, a visit to Happy Valley Racecourse is a must if there is racing on the date of your visit. Check the website for racing schedules to avoid disappointment."

We had a fabulous time; booked through the Hong Kong Jockey Club which included a dinner in their seventh floor restaurant with viewing balcony, binoculars on hand - we first thought it was dog racing we were so far up! We also went down to the ring to see the horses walk round. A fabulous evening and we've recommended it many times over to friends and colleagues.Such a shame we couldn't take our teenage children this year whilst we were there for a return trip."

We thought this would be a highlite of our stay and we stayed in a hotel across the road and had easy access on Wednesday night through the subway from the hotel. We read that buying a tourist badge was the best option. The ticket box people had very poor English and we were not given any brochure or program which would give better information about where Tourist Badge people were allowed to go. The cost was a lot more than in the $12 public area which is not upmarket. We went to eat in a part where our tourist badge allowed and sat at a table by the windows overlooking the course which did not have a \"reserved\" ticket on the table, only to be told after starting to eat that we were not allowed to sit there! It was very embarrassing and we gulped down our meal out on a little stand up bar table! We then went to find a seat in the stand as the races were starting and discovered that the \"locals\" place sheets of newspaper over the seat next to themselves just to save it for their bags etc, and very few seats left for visitors. The Happy Valley Races do not offer a welcome to overseas visitors. Would not waste my money again or if we did go again it would be in the public area where you do get value for money!"

Having never been to any kind of horse racing I wasn't really sure what to expect, and I was in a really bad mood on the night we visited so of course I was sure that I would have a dreadful time, but the night actually ended up being the most fun I'd had in ages! I'd liken it a bit to the bingo with horses, each race is really short so you have a bit of time to place your bets and then have a drink or some fast food in between races, there's plenty of room to stand around so that you can see at least some of the races, and of course it's thrilling when your horse does well!A thoroughly good time to be had, the races are well organised, betting is easy, and the little booklets they give you with all of the information are easy to read- good even for a first time gambler like me!"

We handed this in and it seemed to work. Staff are very patient. The side shows area annoying because they are allowed to go right in front of the track and obstruct the view which is stupid, they should all be moved back nearer the stands. Macdonalds, drinks, a very efficient fast food outlet sells hot dogs and chips and Chinese food. Pricey and poor but just what you'd expect. There is a huge screen to watch the racing on.

OK here we go racing recommenced about three weeks ago and will stop when months are really hot.Originally racecourse was never high on my list but it should have been.Now it should be high on your list.In geographic walking order head to the Jockey offices at northern end of complex.You can enter reception hall see some murals and get a feel for members only and staff areas of the offices.Outside a nice bronze horse at full gallop.Walking past numerous fibreglass statues of horses in colours one first approaches a car park entry.What few people know is that on non race days the public can enter here for free and run on the 1km perimeter track. It is off limits and used for traffic and ambulances during racedays on Saturday and Wednesday. But at other times from early in morning you can run this great 1km track and feel like royalty.The views at night are to die for.About another 30m south from car park one enters the Jockey Museum and if feel like it take your special lady or man to a swanky restaurant just opposite.Exiting and following wall of grandstands south one rounds to the southern end and cheap exit for public at $HK10.Other entries one passes are for members and annual ticket holders which may use higher boxes. The $Hk10 entrance can use Octopus Card.Inside on racedays races are about every 30 minutes with around 12 horses per race doing 1 track.Good luck looking at form guide because races are only one lap there is usually a photo finish of about 4 or more horses.So your horse can be going good until last 100m but you never really know if it did good at end because it is full on finish. Myself I bet a place bet for $HK10 and go for reasonable odds and hope it comes in first 1-4.For betting go up steps and you will find plenty of blue coats to help you fill in a form.But suggest waiting for the odds about 10 minutes before race.There is also a saying that if racecourse is doing badly that the long shot in last race will win.In between races there are stage performances, freebies, food and of course beer.One can see horses parade before start of race at end and lots of pretty ladies promoting things.Take a souvenir from the shop.In the centre of Happy Valley racecourse is property of adjacent Football Club and it has full on services from Restaurants,playing fields and presentation of all sports and is currently under reconstruction."

Race evenings make the area very very busy.Beer is reasonable priced and the atmosphere electric. Much more fun than many of the race courses that I have been to in the rest of the world. Hong Kong people love to gamble and many of the people bet on Number 8 which is the Chinese lucky number, even if number 8 has three legs people will bet on it.Number 4 is unlucky number, so even if the horse is the best in the race, it will not always show the tightest odds."

If you like local color, a fever-pitch atmosphere and people-watching, go to the horse races at Happy Valley (this venue being centrally located on Hong Kong Island is more easily accessible than the Shatin Racecourse in the New Territories). Entrance to the General Stand is HK$10 payable at the entrance. For HK$100 and upon presentation of your passport, you can get a one-day Member's Badge that allows you to watch the races in the Members' Area. You can also take the Horseracing Tour if you are a foreign passport holder and willing to pay more. The extra fee covers transportation to and from the racecourse, a buffet lunch/dinner and a drink, a HK$30 voucher for betting, access to the Members' Boxes and the betting halls, and a tour of the parade ground and winning post between races. A friend who is a member of the Jockey Club invited me to have supper with her and her family at the Happy Valley Jockey Club Moon Koon Restaurant on a racenight. There, we watched the races in a very pleasant environment as we enjoyed fine Cantonese cuisine. Check the race schedule beforehand. The horseracing season is from September to June or early July. Check out the Hong Kong Racing Museum (it is now closed but will be re-opened in September 2015)."

This race course is located in the middle of tall buildings and apartment blocks. It's hard to get a good look at it unless you go up the hills to the lookouts. We were unable to get into the course on the day we were there as there was some security thing happening. But I think it would be worth a visit."

If you take your passport along with you for HK130 (about AUD$20) you can gain admittance to the Members area which was really good. We also crossed over to the General Admission area during the evening and had great fun down right on the fence. To be up close and personal with the horses on a warm and balmy night with lit up skyscrapers and people filled stands was an amazing sight. Just loved it."

It is really popular on a Wednesday night and has a great atmosphere and is just 10 Hong Kong dollars to get in - basically a quid! Then it is up to what you spend. There is a lot of take away style food available. I had chicken and rice but it was more like bones and rice. The pork and rice option looked good though. Definitely worth a visit if you get the chance. Travel afterwards is tricky and you might need to wait or walk for taxi unless you are clued up on the trams waiting outside."

Since then I was amazed by this catchy atmosphere you experience on this Wednesday night evening event. If you are a tourist in Hong Kong avoid the expensive Jockey Club entrance. Use the public entrance which is costing much less. What I personally like is that you will meet any kind of person on Wednesday night at the race course. From taxi driver, expat, local white collar worker, tourist, rich and famous everybody is there to bet on horses and have a good time with his friends. After the races I recommend to move over to Wan Chai. Especially it is worth a trial, as on Wednesdays it is ladies night in many bars and selected drinks are for free! If you visit Hong Kong you should have experienced this special atmosphere at least once."

It is several years ago now (not June 2014) that I did this but one midweek evening after our training course had finished I caught a bus/trolly down to Happy Valley Racecourse. I decided not to take up the tourist offer of access to the grandstand and lounges but head into the general public area. From memory the admission was something like $2 and, dressed in a suit, I was yelling with the locals to encourage our favoured horses around the track. One mistake I made was to carry my camera (taking of photos wasn't allowed) but security just gestured for me to keep it under my jacket, rather than surrender it, and not take photos. I still have fond memories of this experience and feel it was the better for mixing with the locals rather than the corporate experience."

According to web info, it's about 1370m for one lap, its well-paved flat path (next to the racetrack), and is perfect for travelers who are tired of running track-mill. Changing room, toilet and lockers are available at the building in the middle of the sports ground. And the best part is, the field is open to public except on a race day. I went there for my morning jog. It's so good when I found out that I was running like a local there, we run together, and say hi to each other. Besides runners, there are many old folks were doing there \"Tai-Chi\" or daily exercise, while a group of kids were playing football there. It is truly a relax and wonderful morning for me in a hustle bustle city like Hong Kong."

This is racing with a party twist, everyone is here to have fun, dance and be merry, jugs of beer, live bands and party people make for an excellent night out. Entry is only 10HK$, you will need a ten dollar coin or scan your Metro Octopus card to get through the turnstiles. The racing is great fun, bets are easy to place and the atmosphere is great, some dress up, hen nights in fancy dress is common and many come straight from work in their suits but its hot so don't wear too much! Air conditioning inside is bliss but the toilets are not fancy or big, and after a while not particularly clean either. You can grab a hot dog trackside or visit the cafes and bars inside. Plan ahead as its location is in a busy part of Hong Kong and timing on a Wednesday night makes it hard to get to in a hurry, several trams stop nearby and the Metro is a short walk. Taxi's are perfect on a hot night as they are air conditioned but leave plenty of time as you will no doubt be stuck in traffic. There are many themed nights throughout the season but as it gets too hot for the horses the racing stops, usually around late June. You can still visit HV for a great night out but sadly no racing."

A night time tram ride to Happy Valley Racecourse, it brings you to travel to another dimension of the city.Take the ride after 9:00 p.m. when the tram is no more mass public transportation but a tourist transport. Tram is Hong Kong traditional transport. It allows you riding with fresh air, trees are along the side of Wong Nai Chung Road. If you are lucky enough, the tram stops at the Broadwood Road station, you can have a glance of the St Margaret Mary's Catholic Church on the left hand side on a hill slope. And there is less traffic during night time, you can feel the speed and shaky of riding on a tram. It is so much fun and relaxing.It costs HK$2.3 for a tram ride. No matter you take the eastward tram or westward tram, you can get on a tram with Happy Valley as terminus."

Lots of beer and wine available as well as a few fast food restaurants to grab a burger and chips from.It's a really sociable place, and everyone is there to have a good time. Definitely take some money to place bets. I'm not big on betting so I only put small amounts on, but it makes the races so much more exciting!It was a little chilly in the evening so definitely wrap up warm around this time of year.I'm really pleased we decided to go to Happy Valley. I'll go again next time I'm in Hong Kong!"

I have always heard that Happy Valley is one of the most exciting horse race locations in the world and let me tell you, it didnt disappoint.The grandstand looks almost like a 10 storey building and as it is house right on the track, every seat has a great view and vantage point.I booked through Splendid Tours who did a great job and I would recommend them. The tour may not be that cheap at about AUD100 but that included transport to and from, a buffet meal plus as many drinks as you would like (beer, wine etc) plus a great seat. It also included tuition as to how to bet there which you will need. Then the fun starts and trust me, it is so much fun.Do it!!!"

No need to know anything about the horses in advance - there are plenty of free papers around with hints and tips. The staff are very used to tourists and experts at checking they are placing the bets you wanted. We sat in the beer garden section for most of the night, placing low value bets, drinking cold beers and people watching. A great evening out which I would highly recommend to anyone in the area on a Wednesday. We paid for the tourist pass but really I wouldn't bother. We may have missed something but we couldn't see what extra you got for it. You can sit in the end section but when we got there most of the seats there were taken. Other than that I don't see any benifit - the end section is also further from the bars and food stalls."

Music playing, bands, lots of people and what a fabulous atmosphere. It is very easily located on HK Island. We caught the Double Tram right to the track and what a great atmosphere that was also. Totally crowded with every one going to the track. Its is incredible cheap to get in and you can even use your Oyster card. Betting isn't hard to get the hang of and drink and food is cheap. Beer is sold on plastic jugs. The location is incredible with so many high rise buildings overlook the track. For a fabulous experience even if you don't follow the horses, don't go past a great night, cheap and great atmosphere at Happy Valley."

Depending upon the time of the year and nightly theme the rowdiness and crowds can vary (opening nights for Oktoberfest are out of control). This is were many expats go to unwound during mid-week and in some ways you may even forget you are in an Asian city. The Tai Hing skyline offers the best sports stadium backdrop in the world - on par with baseball stadiums in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Entry is $10HKD - use an Octopus card - and beers start at $40HKD. Food is also reasonably priced by Hong Kong standards. The entrance is one the southwest corner - and if you want to complete the Hong Kong experience, pick up a tram near Times Square and ride to the racecourse in style."

On this tour there was a continuous buffet with great food, sweets were amazing. Drinks were also free flowing, good Sav Blanc and my husband had a choice of a few different beers. After the 5th race we were taken downstairs (optional) to go to the marshalling yard and then watched the race in front of the winning post. We then visited the souvenir desk to purchase momentos - hats, ties etc. the trip does leave before the last race but we elected to stay, keep drinking and watched the last race home. You then have to find your own way home but the mtr is right there. We were placed on a table with two English couples and had the best night.

Check the web sites for this and Sha Tin and book in advance is my tip. Also get a lesson on filling in the tote tickets, its different to Australia but easy to learn once you are shown.

Its setting is magical - the course is surrounded by skyscrapers and at night could rival Disney - the atmosphere is great, and the evening is one not to be missed. The area is small enough that you can get close and watch the horses parade before the race ['that's the one I'm going to back, I'm sure it just winked at me!'], and then you can move across and be on the rails for the actual events.and see the whole thing both actually and on the big screen showing the parts of the track that you cannot see. Mind you it is almost as much fun to watch the people watching the races!!! It is very cheap to get in - unless you want to get up into the boxes [which I dont recommend, the fun is on the ground!], and bets can be small. You can get both food and drink - we've never tried the former we're always too busy, but we do buy pitchers of lager to share - often necessary because of the amount of encouragement shouted to your runner!! We wouldn't miss it - it is an evening of fun and excitement - we've never come away richer [perhaps that horse just had a twitch!!] but that's not why we go.Do watch out for the fact that the area surrounding the area is more or less gridlocked before an event so allow plenty of time to get there and get in, and it isn't always easy to get away after the event - the trams do line up outside the course and it is worth thinking of taking one of them - just to get away from the area if they are not going your way!"

HK has two race courses where the other one locates at Shatin.As a local HKer, I do encourage visitors to see this place and try their luck see if they can win a free dinner... or a free trip! Good Luck!(Note: age under 18 is not allow to enter so if you have kids you'd better settle them down)"

It just happened to be Oktoberfest and on this Wednesday, we immersed ourselves with the locals and expats to enjoy beer and horse racing in the Bier Garten right by the track. Everyone knows the backdrop of this race course is phenomenal (you definitely won't forget you're in Hong Kong), the grand stand is a work of art, and the crowds' passion is contagious. If you take the Happy Valley trams, you can get off right at the public entrance; however, you may also walk from Times Square (about a 10-15 minute walk) or Wanchai. I have tried the tourist admission before and it was definitely a better experience (as in more abundant restrooms, food choices, etc.), however since we were meeting with some locals, we just went straight authentic this time. We got there early to get a spot right in front of the billboards by the fences with the shelves to set for our food and drinks on. Getting up close to feel like you can reach the horses when they go by with their trainers is a wonderful feeling! However, if you snooze you definitely have to fight crowds and deal with not being able to secure your beverages or foods in a comfortable manner. There is beverages and foods galore, all for HK $10 - go for the betting or just go to be there! Just remember, later in the night when more foods and beverages are consumed by the crowds, there are not many restrooms available versus the amount of attendees, so get in line early!!I didn't bet, however my fiance did in the beginning; by the 6th race he said that the inside was like a mad house and the lines were crazy, so he just enjoyed the horses racing by. There were 8th races and it can get to be a very late night, so wear good shoes and comfortable clothes; no bulky bags because there is not a lot of space when the crowds start piling up...In general, you have to go and experience Happy Valley when you're in Hong Kong; it's a very unique experience!"

Very busy for a Wednesday night. If you visit the Hong Kong Jockey Club with your passport you can purchase a tourist card for about $130HK which is about $23AUS which allows you into the members section which is not as busy as general when wanting to place bets. Placing bets is easy when you get the hang of it. Very similar to filling out tab tickets back home. The crowd is amazing and up roaring every race. My partner and I were dressed up as you would at the races in Australia, suit and tie, dress and heels but people dressed like us were very few and far between. Many is shorts and shirt which was a little disappointing. We managed to score a spot right on the finish line which made the experience 10 times better."

Different from what we are accustomed to see on racetracks. In the intervals between the races, there is a kind of party, fueled by booze and people dancing as if they were in a true night club. Very fun! Worth knowing."

The racecourse is located right in the center of Hong Kong, we took old fashioned tram there from central area and it only costs HK$2.3 which is 30 cents in US$. After the race, we took the same tram back to central again with no waiting time because there are many trams lines up to load people. The course is beautiful with high buildings and mountains as the backdrop, with all the lights and night sky, it is amazingly beautiful. Plenty chairs to sit for free or standing drinking a beer. Few beer stands, price is bit high, but you can bring your own beer or food or whatever in with you, no bag check, no security check!Crowd is interesting to watch also besides betting on horses. Mixed crowd indeed, locals and foreigners, youngsters and elders, all there having good time. It only cost HK$10 to get in to have a great night out in Hong Kong!"

It will give you access to a section right next to the finish line and a better perspective of the entire place. 2. Check the website before you go to confirm that the races are happening. I happened to go on one of the few \"Wednesday\" race nights that didn't occur on a Wednesday.3. Dress up a little bit nicer. Wear pants and a collared shirt.Don't:1. Frozen beer. Although the concept of frozen beer is novel, the frozen part on top is just the crappy foam."

How wrong we were, we had one of the best nights our on honeymoon! We opted to go the for the cheaper entrance fee meaning we could stand right in ther thick of the action and the fence. The atmosphere was fantastic, we even had a gamble and won on every race! We don't know a great deal about placing bets but staff were very helpful and the race programme helped us choose which horses to go for. The stadium was brilliant and the backdrop was even better. The track is overlooked by skyscrapers all the way around which made for the atmosphere, especially when lit up at night.We'd say it is a MUST DO in Hong Kong even if you're not into Horse racing or gambling."

The race course is litterly in the middle of the city, so you have these sky scrapers around you while your enjoying yourself at the races. Cost about $1.20 aus to get in (10HK)So efficient with their bars and food there was no wait for drinks and they had live music, dancing and competitions. Putting a bet on was super easy too.The whole grandstand is open to the general public but on your far left the speakers call everything out in chinese/cantoneese (sorry for bad spelling) and the right side where the bands are bars are is all in english. So many expats too so its a great mix of hong kong and western culture.Honestly, it was in my top 5 things i did in HK and ill defiantly go back if im ever in HK again. "

I went by myself but I could see how if you go with friends, you could stay all night!

You have to put a coin in yourself, but there are official employees standing there who will give you change if you don't have a $10 coin. You'll see everyone from old Chinese men gambling to young expats dressed to the nines, to couples dating to good friends hanging out. I didn't pay for the \"tourist packages\" that are advertised, but I squeezed into a great standing spot right by the fence and the winners circle. I watched 2 races and then walked around for a bit.

It's pretty neat to think that this is a major equine location, so it's an insight into something new, even if you'll never watch another horse race again! Also, it's right in the middle of the city, so the Hong Kong skyline is gorgeous around you. All in all, it was a fun night. I had been to Hong Kong before so this was a nice \"extra\" rather than running around checking off tourist destinations off a list! There is also a free Jockey Museum (before the turnstyles - you have to exit to get to them if you are already inside, although I think if you have paid to access the Members Clubhouses, etc., you can get to it without accessing) and I stopped in there before they closed at 9pm.

Use the $10 entrance as everybody does and it's where the main areas are. No need to pay more for the toffs areas. The racecourse is 15 minute walk from the MTR so allow that time to walk there. Also, take a pen! Most people go out for a few beers after so be prepared for a heavy night drinking, we got back to the hotel at 630am! "

Wednesday night racing is therefore something of an iconic event in which Hong Kong's gambling-mad populace bet around HK$80 million on each of the night's 8 races. We booked a package in advance at \u00a374 a head which included access to the visitors boxes in the main stand, a generous buffet dinner with unlimited alcohol, great views of all the races, paddock access, and private betting stations. We had a great evening with friends, won some, lost some, and were only down HK$244 (\u00a320) on the night.

Great atmosphere; although expensive, there's food, drinks, music, cool people, what more could you ask for. There are always events with entertainers, little contests/games, you can do a little betting. It's a fun night out in a cool setting. If you have time, I recommend to check it out."

Easy to put on bets and very helpful staff for those who are first timers at the Valley. You need to book at one of the restaurants. We went to the Gallery. You will need to give your credit card on booking so make sure you turn up!Food is OK. Buffet starters and dessert but set main which you order and collect when your buzzer sounds at the table. The only down side is that if you want anything different for a main there are additional charges. You can go to the buffet and dessert counter as many times as you like. If we went again we would stick to the pizza , which is huge, and the desserts and starter counter.Take you passport if you want to get into the members stand as a guest. Make sure you leave well before the last race as the police close off part of the road. Queue up at the taxi rank outside the main public gate."

Gave access to most of course but realy if you just want a fun night out only need to buy ticket at gate. General entrance and go with the fun crowd. Band playing between races. Plenty of beer for sale and easy betting. It's realy just a great fun Wednesday night out that's cheep and cheerful. Easy to get to. Just hope on a tram going to happy valley and get off with everybody else and follow the crowd. Same getting back. If you are staying in Kowloon just get the underground or Starr ferry to Central and hope on a tram. Easy as.betting in hong king dollars is fun and unless you are a serious punter won't cost you an arm and leg. Just stick to the favourites and have fun."

We did this night out a little better!I stayed at the Excelsior Hotel and booked this night out with 5 associates.While we could have walked to the track, for $900 HKD (roughly $125 Canadian) we were treated to Coach trip and sat in the Hong Kong Jockey Clubs private members box.We enjoyed a sumptuous buffet, beer and wine included, and the most incredible view of the track. Our special guide coached us in the subtleties of Hong Kong betting and helped explain the racing form. The highlight of the night was a trip to the paddock area for the 5th race and seats right at the rail finish line.The view is amazing. To have a grass racetrack right smack in the middle of a huge city and surrounded by 100 story buildings!The staff were polite and informative and while our betting did not fill our pockets it was great to know that the proceeds basically all go to charity.What a great way to spend a Wednesday night out!"

Recommend going with the crowds for general entrance and you can then watch the horses parading around the ring, watch the races from the rails or sit in the stands and cheer on your horse. A large screen enables you to follow the race around the track. I would recommend getting the useful English programme at the track as this gave a comprehensive guide to all the horses, the jockeys and tips on their current form. Eight races over the evening and the time just flew by. Definitely a fun and enjoyable evening."

Despite reading reviews saying there is no advantage to the 'tourist entry ticket' we felt safer on a first visit doing this - what a pair of idiots, all the facilities were in the 'cheap' section, - absolutely no need to pay the extra - Pay 10 HK dollars, not 100.Commentary is in Chinese BUT toward the middle of the stand it is in English, well worth finding this bit if English is your language.We are regular racegoers in the UK so felt at home with horses/betting etc. Soon got the hang of the betting slips - despite nearly wagering \u00a3140 on first bet due to ticking a wrong box! The staff are very helpful and friendly.In the stands people put newspapers over chairs to save them - worth doing if there early enough. A wide variety of food and drink is available. All reasonably priced.Music and various entertainers are a norm.Beware at the end there is no immediate public transport (or taxi). We walked back to our hotel near Causeway (the nearest station) in about 15 minutes.A really good night out at a very impressive racecourse."

As we were staying opposite the Happy Valley Racecourse and we were staying on a Wednesday we thought we had to visit it on their Wednesday night race meet. We actually went inside the day before as there is a running track you can use.We had seen that it was only about a \u00a31 (UK) to get into the racecourse but there was also a \u201cTourist Ticket\u201d for about \u00a310 which meant you could access other parts of the racecourse areas. We spoke on two occasions to box office staff beforehand when we were given the impression that we could access many more areas with the Tourist Ticket. We therefore went ahead and bought them on admission after again asking more questions about access. Also we were told 3 different prices.When we got to the lift we asked one of the girl stewards which areas we could access with our tickets and she said \u201cthe second floor\u201d. Fine. We went to the second floor, going past numerous stewards and found seats outside near the finishing line. Great we thought. Husband went out to buy some drinks, again going past stewards both in and out and he was allowed back to the seats without any problem. We then decided to go down to the main area to see what it was like. Husband bought some food from there, he went back up to our seats, again past stewards who did not query him going where we had been sitting, whilst I queued for some Chinese food inside \u2013 which was absolutely delicious; best and cheapest takeaway I\u2019ve ever had. When I went to go back to where my husband was I was told I couldn\u2019t go through. Took me a bit by surprise as no one had stopped us when we had been going in and out previously. Thought there must have been a language problem and I had misunderstood. When I got to where we had been sitting someone else was in the seats where we had sat and our possessions had been removed to the next seat. No problem I thought! The man looked at us very aggressively and I stared back at him wondering what it was all about. Turned out the area was for season ticket holders, which of course we didn\u2019t know. A steward came over and said we had to move. I complained and said we had bought the tickets asking lots of questions beforehand as to where we could go and we had gone in and out on numerous occasions. She came back and told us firstly that we had to move and then if we wanted to pay more we could stay in the seats as the people whose seats they were weren\u2019t attending that day. I said no and that the box office (and their website) had misrepresented the extent of where we could go and if I were to move I would want a full refund. Senior steward came over and said we could have a refund and escorted us out of the seats as if we were some sort of criminals (might add I\u2019m a small grey haired 64 year old!) and gave us a refund. We noticed there were other people, who like us, hadn\u2019t appreciated that it was very limited where you could go on the tourist ticket as they were being turned away from areas..Moral of this story is DON\u2019T BOTHER BUYING THE TOURIST TICKET. Just go for the basic entrance price.Just as a PS. We chose the first two winners but didn\u2019t know how to bet so didn\u2019t win any money! We went back to our room overlooking the racecourse and watched it from there as we had a good view."

I went for the cheapest entry which at 10 HKD is ridiculously cheap and gives access to what I'm sure is the most fun section - and there is seats as well.Standing right next to the track you as close to the action as you'll ever get, there's loads of places selling beer and lots of entertainment during races.I didn't know what to expect, but it really feels like a place where loads of people (expats, tourist ...) go out on a Wednesday.Lots of fun."

We purchased our tourist tickets from the local betting office (there are many all over Hong Kong) and it was well worth the small entrance fee to be have access to the members' stand. Happy Valley races are held each Wednesday night during race season and is certainly a great night out."

And what a fun experience it was!Getting to the course was easy - you can take the MTR to Times Square and once you are outside there are fairly obvious signs to the track. It is about a 10 min walk - you can also just get a cab ride which we did after with no problem. This essentially allows you access to most areas of the course including the parade area and the standing space right by the finish line. It's easy to get the pass - just go into the lodge box entrance (not the main gate at the end) and you will see a sign for \"tourist passes\" The staff behind the window will check your passport (to make sure you have HK stamp) and then give you a small tag to attach to your shirt or pants once you have paid the fee. Inside the course you can get the racing forms and booklets. Placing bets was easy, although some of the options are different. In addition we discovered after a few races that it seems to be easier to win, so make sure you keep all of your tickets and bring them back to the window to double check. The serious fans watches the races, reviewed the horses and made a few bets, while the rest of us enjoyed a few beers, met some interesting people and enjoyed the great night view. I would highly recommend adding this to your HK plans - I'm just sorry it took me several trips to get out there!"

It's certainly an experience getting the Tram; crowded, small and noisy they may be, but a really fun experience.When you get to the HV terminus, follow the road around in the direction you were travelling and then cross the road. Follow the path for around 150 metres and you will end up at a large, brightly lit entrance. There are ladies there waiting to help you buy the tickets at 10 dollars a pop - around 85p for my UK friends!On entry, it is all laid out for you immediately. Food and drink stands are immediately followed by betting tip teams who will hand you an English language race guide and quickly run you through the betting system, which is fairly logical. A quick tip to my UK compatriots who are used to Each Way betting - at HV to do an EW bet you need to do two separate bets, one for a win and the other for a place. They aren't done under the same bet as they are at home, as I embarrassingly found to my cost when questioning, ever so politely, the lower than anticipated payout when my placed bet horse won the 7th race. DOH! After that just grab a beer, place your bets and enjoy a raucous, fun, buzzing night out. Highly recommended."

We had wondered about doing the full-on excursion trip with entry into the Members etc, but our little dip-in and dip-out was all we really needed.

Food and beer on offer is inexpensive but of good quality. The crowd is fun and lively. All this for a nominal HKD10 entrance fee. Believe me when I say that some of the hottest people in the city come here just to see and be seen.The final races of the 2012-2013 season culminated with 26,000 people in attendance at the Happy Valley night race season finale.There was a record breaking turnover of almost HKD94 billion, up 10 percent over the previous racing year, and higher than previous best during the 1996-1997 pre-handover racing season.To get to the races which start at around 7pm and go on all the way till past 10pm; take an eastbound tram marked \"Happy Valley\". Fare is HKD2.30. Get off at the terminus, and walk about 300 meters to the entrance gate. Pay HKD10 and your in the thick of the action!"

We were treated to good bar service and a decent buffet. However, my takeaways were the heavy Australian accent of the announcer who was calling the race and the feeling the roar of the crowd - making it in my eyes an authentic spectacle - but also the electronic gaming desks, where young hosts/hostesses helped punters use this giant ipad like contraption to review the horses, jockeys and trainers to assist with your betting. A very entertaining evening!"

In between courses we went outside to watch the races. Downside side was that it was really difficult to get a taxi afterwards, but I suppose that's everywhere when there's thousands of people trying to get home at the same time. Well worth a visit if you have a night free."

Races from September to July normally on Wednesday evening 3 times out of 4, but days do change so best to check before going. One source is the South China Morning Post which provides a racing supplement on race days and normally helps to narrow the choice of picking a winner from the normal start of 12 horses. Entrance fee gets you in to the beer garden which on most nights is very lively with a great atmosphere and alternate entertainment in between the races. Beer and food are fairly priced and normally the cost of your evening is how much you want to gamble. Other alternatives available through the HK Jockey Club which provides food and drink packages for around HKD500 which again are fair value and in venues which provide less hustle and bustle than the beer garden. However, my preference is the atmosphere of the Beer Garden having a few beers with friends. Top jockeys are Douglas White, Brett Prebble and Mark Chadwick. Top trainers at HV are CH Yip and C.Fownes, but to be honest favorite number, colours or names work just as well work.Good luck !!"

We arrived 15 min before the start of the races and had our choice of seats. If you go after the start of the races, you'll have a hard time finding seats. Inside the stadium there is a beer garden, McDonalds, and a few other food stands. I saw people bringing in their own food, which is a good idea if you're into healthy foods.

Plenty of beer on offer and even gambling novices can part with a few dollars for the experience of seeing your horse fail miserably !The course is also open in the day with sports fields and jogging tracks although once around the track in 90 degree heat and nearly 100 % humidity is enough for both man and beast . Most surreal experience was watching London Scottish playing rugby against a Hong Kong side while jogging , hopefully they replaced the fluid they must have lost during the match in the usual rugby post match tradition."

With the member's entry, there's really not a lot of extra area you can get into compared to the public entry. The biggest negative is that there is no 'bar' in the member area. The bars are in the public area, and the atmosphere is much better. The only reason you will spend the extra HKD 90 for the member area is that you can stand right in front of the finishing line, and get a lot more up close to the horses (and jockeys). However, if you are just there for a (few) beer and a (few) bet, then just spend the HKD 10 and have a great time!"

It does seem a little expensive as the racetrack is close to the ferry terminal on Hong Kong Island and the basic entrance fee is quite small. But for the \u00a360 or so, you get coach transport to and from Kowloon right to the front door of the Hong Kong Jockey Club entrance. From here we were whisked up to a dining room high up in the main stand with an outside viewing terrace. Here unlimited drinks, wine beer or soft drinks were served before a superb hot buffet with a fantastic choice of hot and cold, vegetable and meat dishes were offered. A wonderful selection of sweets and gateaux were also available.The price also included betting vouchers for 3 races, we also had bets on the other races, both of us had winners and came away with a modest profit.For the 5th race we were walked down to the parade enclosure to watch the horses and jockeys close up, as they left the paddock for the race track we were escorted over to the finishing post to watch the race.This was an excellent night, it was great fun and the food was only surpassed by the electric atmosphere. A must-do for anyone in Hong Kong on a Wednesday night."

We also had the chance to visit on the Saturday afternoon meet which was great as there were almost 55,000 people there and the atmosphere is electric and if you choose general admission it is only $10 about 90p so who can go to the races for that in the UK and have the wonderful atmosphere of Happy Valley along with the fantastic view which is on offer. -"

I mean, for years, it was the Sierra Nevada mountains, then later, the Mission Ranch Restaurant in Carmel, California, but now I have to think it over. And I don't know a thing about horse racing. For a year I lived a half mile from Del Mar and never went. Truth is, I was in HK on business and thought of John LeCarre's cold war novel The Honorable Schoolboy, the story takes place in Hong Kong and one of the main characters spends a lot of time at Happy Valley. And It just happened to be a \"Happy Wednesday\" when they run the horses and I took a cab to the track, along with some co-workers who were willing to indulge me for a while. They ended up like the place as much as I did. As an American used to violent live sporting events in the USA, I thought to brace myself. The last time I went to a SF Giants game I practically had to fight a guy. But once I got to Happy Valley, I found it unlike anything I've experienced in the USA, and it was probably the turning point at which I began to fall in love with Hong Kong. I've now been to HK six times and have managed to visit the track on every trip. I love going there. I don't care if I lose money, I'm grateful to be alive and sitting in the stands. I love being at fun events with happy people, and I dislike violence, so HV is a good place. But there's much more to it.The track is gorgeous in every regard, it is amazingly beautiful. It's surrounded by skyscrapers, but is an oasis of greenery and gorgeous lighting. The place is immaculate and well run, and there's an absence of aggression and rowdiness. There's not a golf course in the world that compares to this gorgeous setting, and everyone, including the staff is happy to be there.There's a kind of beer garden trackside, below the stands, where you'll see a range of business types in suits and locals in casual clothes, just enjoying themselves as the horses run by, but again, no aggression, just nice people there to unwind. No bums, no thugs, no tattooed boneheads, it's un-American !!! The grandstands are multi-level, with basic seats and betting places, hamburgers, Chinese food, restrooms, etc. You enter this section from the street and admission is the equivalent of $1.50 US. You can take an elevator to the top level, with bird's-eye view of the entire track circuit. Or you can stop mid-level where there's a restaurant. There are many other sections and levels of the grandstands, it's quite extensive, some of which reserved for members of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, and some of which are accessible to non-members having dinner in the various restaurants in the stands. I'll let you know about the club seats after I win the lottery.The announcers speak in English and Chinese. These guys are so smooth, so mellow, they could make Julio Iglesias sound like Janis Joplin. It's all part of what makes Happy Valley a civilized, fun, positive, life-celebrating, intelligence and accomplishment-celebrating experience. Though it's not snobby, not at all.How to get there:-Take the MTR to Causeway Bay and take the Happy Valley exit(exit A), though you'll walk a long distance.-Take a cab right to the track. Cabs in HK are cheap and the drivers could win Daytona. Great way to go.-Take the \"tram\" (those funky narrow double-deck British looking electric buses) to the track. Cheap and fun.-DS"

Firstly it is so cheap. 10$ HK to get in, 2.30$ HK to get there.Beers cheaper than in most bars, food at reasonable costs. even McDonalds at normal costs.Races that happen every 30 mins! and entertainment in between each race. The night we went there was a very good band and a couple of very good magicians.The track is close to where you watch the event, in a stand, by the track or where the fun is in the Beer Garden. A brilliant TV screen, information all over the place so newbies quickly work out where to go or have a bet. Signs in English for the tourist!We also thought that the rule that you have to be 18 to come on to the course is very sensible. Race courses with the emphasis on gambling and drinking should not be a place for chn! All in all it is a great nights entertainment even if you do not bet! This is probably why they are so successful. Australia has millions of gamblers but except for a few very special dates, i.e the Cup or a day when Black Caviare was racing nobody turns up trackside. If racing in Australia was a bit more like this then people actually may go along and watch!This was the most enjoyable night and entertainment we experienced in a week in HK."

A visitor can buy a members ticket on presentation of your passport at the member's entrance for $100 but don't bother...There is a beer-garden in the piblic area and they have entertainment all night between races...Adequate fast food options are also available..Betting is easy if you keep it simple...most operators speak English and you can easliy place bets example \"next Race..No.3 win $100\" or Quinella box 4,5,10 for $50....never say please as you may finish up on Place or place quinella.....of course should you want a place bet or place Quinella that's a different story.Good luck with finding a winner."

We booked a package with Viator Tours to keep it all simple to organise and would highly recommend them. Picked up from the lobby of The Excelsior (which in itself was a good place for a drink) taken in a small group by mini coach to the Jockey Club enclosure where we were welcomed with a drink and shown to a table right by the window overlooking the course. Fantastic views. Nothing was too much trouble, the betting was explained, we had $30 each to bet included in the tour cost, we could see the racing from the large outside balcony or on the TV screens and all was made so easy and enjoyable. The buffet food was excellent and much better than we expected. Available throughout the evening so nothing felt rushed or limited. Endless wine was also included which was perfectly acceptable, chocolates, coffee, tea, really anything you wanted. They took us down to the parade ring during the evening, we saw the horses up close and then watched the race right by the ring at the finishing line .... no crowd, all looked after and personally escorted, really felt like a special night out. Even if you've never been to the races make sure you visit Happy Valley on a Wed or Sunday you'll really enjoy the night. And if you don't want any hassle we'd highly recommend booking with Viator. They took care of everything, we met some lovely people in our small group and the evening felt top class and not at all like a 'package'."

If u don't know how to bet on the horses u can get help from the staff. It is very fun to gather some friend and bet a little bit of money or a lot. I mean the most fun thing is to look at those people who screams and shout as it was life or death. You can grab some food on mc Donald's or you can try the street food. You can buy a beer jug to share. They have live music in between the races. If u go here you will have a great time:)"

It takes more time, but its so easy to take any tram that terminates at Happy Valley (written in english on the front of the tram) and pick another one up for the trip back. Couldn't be easier - the terminus is across the street from the track - and its less than $1 US round trip. Add another $1 us for entry fee and you have a unique Hong Kong experience for next to nothing (assuming you don't bet or drink...)If you are not familiar with how the horse races work, you can come late and leave early, and you don't have to bet. if you do, the minimum is about $2.50 US a bet, but since there is only 10 races or so, you won't go broke.There is an option to sign in as a tourist (bring your passport) and get access to the members lounge (about $12 US), which sounds better than it turns out because all the seats are reserved and the area is dominated by semi-intense local bettors. I had a lot more fun down by the trackside beer garden with all the international expats. Theres also different levels of food available, from Mc Donalds on up, so something for everyone."

Make the effort on a Wednesday night, catch a tram or a Taxi, to Happy Valley, pop your $10 coin in the turnstile or swipe your octopuss card and enter a wonderful sporting arena. I have enjoyed thouroughbred racing in Australia for over 30 years and was not going to let this opportunity slide during my recent brief trip to Hong Kong. Regrettably kids are not permitted into the racetrack.I had planned to pay the extra $100HKD to enter the members concourse but I was more than happy enjoying the atmosphere of the public area. A broad spectrum of punters in attendance, numerous food and \"beer\" options (I am not entirely sure if there was anything other than beer available) There was a Heinekin tent, Stella Artois tent, San Miguel tent etc.... High Granstands and scryscrapers envelope this short lush track which sees the field of horses pass the main straight and finishing post twice in even the shortest of races giving the crowd plenty of opportunity to view and cheer on their selected pony. The mounting yard is enormous and accessible in terms of opprtunity to view the horses as they enter the arena. I could not find a betting ring with private bookies anywhere. All bets are placed with a central betting authority with numerous booths around the public area. The betting slips and race info screeens are easy to follow if you know a bit about horse racing. If you don't, there are attendants hovering around the the betting booths carrying clipboards assisting tourists to complete their betting slips. DJ's play tunes between races which are generally 20-25 minutes apart unless there is a protest. A protest will see the race meet stop until the stewards adjudicate. Head to the Devil's Advocate in Wan Chai for a pint on your way home."

I booked the tour for this through Viator which offered cheaper prices than those offered by our travel agent. I am not very interested in racing but my partner is a keen punter so I went with very low expectations. To my suprise, we had a really terrific evening. We were taken by bus to the race course and then escorted to an eighth floor box by the tour guide. We were assigned a table and introduced to our fellow guests, all of whom also came from Australia, but who had been travelling throughout Asia and had plenty of interesting things to share with us about their travels. The evening included a buffet dinner which was of very good standard, with a wide variety of both Western and Asian choices. Drinks were also included and were offered frequently by the very attentive staff. The tour also included a HK$30 betting voucher and race guides which gave all the information needed to place bets. The dining room opened on to a large balcony from which all the races could be viewed. Around half way during the meeting, our guide escorted us downstairs into a track side area where we could view the horses parading before the race. This was located close to the finishing post and we could watch this race from there and really be close to all the excitement! Overall, it was an excellent evening - good food and drink, great company and the opportunity to spend time at a very uniquely located race course. The only bad thing about the night was that the Aussie jockeys let us down badly, with only one win for the night!"

I paid the 100HK$ to go in members (available to tourists if you show your passport) but the general entry of 10HK$ also gives access to excellent viewing areas.In my experience Happy Valley is a unique racing environment. The track is closely surrounded by high rise blocks, the stands are built very high, but because they are close to the track this simultaneously creates the feeling of a major but very intimate racecourse with a stunning cityscape background. In short it's a lot of fun.The Jockeys challenge is a bit of harmless fun where the locals get to see some top European riders up close and the tourists get to see how good the locals (and locally based Aussies) are.For the record, the beer was cold, the hot chicken legs were fantastic and I had a great night on the punting (Thanks Christophe LeMaire and Zac Purton) but tried not to let this colour my review too much."

Once as an international visitor, showing our passports and the second, booking directly with the Hong Kong Jockey Club. The visitor option costs $100HK and gives you access to the lower level members area. It is very congested and can be hard to find a place to sit, particularly if you want to eat. The second occasion we booked directly with the HKJC and paid $210HK. This gave us a pre-booked seat, over looking the racecourse, access to buffet and unlimited soft drink, tea and coffee.The accommodation was better and each table had its own TV monitor to watch the race. Overall it offered the best value."

All very painless, but you do have to wait until after the second last (of ten) races before you can head home if your want to ride back in the bus.Or find your own way there - it's quite easy and inexpensive (take your passport) and you will get some good deals at the members' Entrance."

As an avid horse racing enthusiast who has sold a horse into Hong Kong, a trip to Happy Valley was always on the bucket list. Coming from South Africa where horse racing attendance has dwindled over time it was fantastic to see so many people actually attend a meeting. I was lucky enough to be entertained in the Stewards/members dining room. What a treat - food was ample and tasty and service (both from the waitrons as well as the staff in the tote) was fantastic. But you are really there for the atmosphere and it was something I have never experenced before - around 40 000 people just for an average race meeting. For those who don't know the course, it is much shorter and tighter than the English, French and American tracks which leads to exciting finishes and nerves of steel from the jockeys. Some great finishes and good riding from the South African jocks made for a memorable night and an event I would like to repeat again"

We went on the same tour with the same company reading the same speal on their marketing material. We jumped at the opportunity to go again because of the great times we had had before. We ended up on the 4th floor, close to the bend well away from the finish post. The buffet was 1/4 the size of the last time we went and we had to keep chasing a waiter for a drink. I don't know if this was a one off for renovations or what but if you book, be sure to ask before hand where you will be located. Luckily the company was just as wonderful with strangers having a great time with strangers even though we couldn't understand each other sometimes.

The staff were friendly and helpful and helped me fill out my form so that I was putting the bet on as I intended. We payed 100 HK Dollars to be in the members enclosure which I thought was fairly cheap compared to what I have paid in the UK and we got some great views over the finish line as the horses went past, but apparently you can go in to the public section for just 10 HK Dollars. I expected to have to wait ages to get a taxi as everyone floods out at the same time after the last race, however we just walked up a side street across from the race course and had a taxi to whisk us away in just 5 minutes.

Even if you don't like horse racing - it only costs $10 to go in the public entrance and you could just watch a couple of races and go out. However if you want a seat - get there early. It helps if you are in a group so that someone can keep your seat for you if you go to the food outlets/bars/loo/or to place a bet. Westerners tend to congegrate near the entrance where there aren't many seats - but there is a beer garden.However it can get very crowded indeed - especially October thru December with queues for drinks and real congestion near the entrance where you can be jostled and if you are claustrophobic and don't like that sort of thing I don't recommend it.If you are not familiar with the tote system of betting - then there are helpful English speaking guides at the information desks who will explain how to do it. If you don't like the sweaty crowds and want a more exclusive experience - then there are various ways of getting a race badge for the members' enclosures - and some boxes will have their own bars and catering. I believe this can be arranged through local tour companies, or travel desks at hotels. However the easiest way to do it - is to go to the members' enclosure with your passport and pay HK$100 for ordinary meetings and HK$150 for special meetings. Check the Jockey Club calendar. There is a dress code for the members' enclosure however - generally no jeans, t-shirts, sports shoes, shorts etc. A collared polo shirt with slacks and shoes (with socks) is fine for men - and generally smart casual attire for women is OK.Watch the totalisator and see how much money is bet on each race. A staggering amount."

Winning money is involved so why not? :)There are races at different days as well as eve's organised. I went on the Wednesday eve one which is most popular and I believe useful for tourists. If you stay in HK for longer time you can also book a table at some of the higher levels of arena combined with betting and the dinner.However if you are in HK for a short visit and you happen to spend Wednesday whilst here, go for the horserace. Cheapest entry is HKD 10 and you get to the first level where the horses are actually running. You can put your bets and if you don't understand much of it, don't worry and ask stuff for advise. They are really helpful and explains how the whole thing is working.It was amazing event with quite a crowd (tourists and local \"regular\" attendants to see and experience the feeling or just to win some cash. I end up losing, however did not bet much whereas my friend won some money enough to get 2 cocktails for us later.Start your night out in Happy Valley! I wish you to win some money and enjoy the rest of the night out in central (both when chai and lang kwai fon is close by! :)"

We were going to take a tour to the races but it happened to be fully booked. We were advised it was very easy to do on your own so we gave it a try. You cant miss Happy Valley on race night simply follow the throngs of race goers heading to the Stadium. From Causeway Bay head to the far end of the stadium to the Public entrance, there are multiple turnstiles to enter the stadium and you can use your Octopus card if you have one entrance is very very cheap in comparison to the uk.On entrance you will be met by staff handing out race cards and information, do not feel worried about putting on bets at each of the outside kiosks there are staff helping you complete the forms and explaining the bets. There is a lovely atmosphere in the public area, between each race there was a band playing. Lots of food and beverage outlets including McDonalds to grab a bite to eat. You will get a large mix of tourists and locals many who have come straight from work in their suits to catch the night races.As darkness falls you appreciate the sheer scale of the stadium and all the lights twinkling.If your stuck for something to do in Hong Kong give it a go"

If you want to take a look at the racecoursefield, the cheapest way is to take a tram that goes to Happy Valley that circle round the area to give you a good look. Remember to stay in the upper deck and sit on the right side of the tram. If you want to look from the top, after visiting the Peak, take a bus that goes to Central (upper deck of course!) and you can have a view from the top. If you have time, just leave the tram at the terminal and walk around the residential area and enjoy the food provided by the restaurants/cafe there. You may be surprised on their quality - local taste! Don't go there too early (after 11:00 a.m.). Stay away from racing day if you are not the fans."

When you get there you are taken to the \"member\" entrance, which is really nice as the lines for the normal entrance were huge. You go up the elevator and you are in your own private A/C dining area for a gourmet buffet meal including all the wine, beer and mixed drinks you want. You have your own private persons to take your bets so you do not have to fight the crowds at the normal counters. You have your own private balcony to watch the race outside. Another highlight was being taken down to track level at the finish line to watch one race. The whole evening was a blast and I would highly recommend it even if you are not gamblers or into horse racing."

The people of Hong Kong are passionate about horses (?gambling) and the place was electric. A big screen broadcasts how much money has been bet on each race and it is mind-boggling. I placed some bets, had no idea what I was doing, and unfortunately still had to show up to work the next day.There is reasonably priced food/drinks for purchase and they had a band playing in the general admissions section.

            "review": "Hong Kong Tea..... It really has little to do with the attraction The Happy Valley, but i happened to have sampled the Hong Kong Tea in the Happy Valley, so i just write about the unique local flavour, the Hong Kong Tea.Happy Valley is a residential area where one will find a lot of expats living here. There are even two drinking pubs adjacent to each other at the south end of the race track. Both are neighbourhood pubs where you will see the local expats drink and eat nightly here. They are very much like the pubs in London, and the whole neighbourhood is very clean and neat. You will find everything that you need to lead a normal metropolitan life in the Valley. I walked along the Sing Woo Road the major artery running south off the Wong Nai Chung road and straight uphill to the mountain, and stepped into a local restaurants where you can have all day breakfast, lunch or anything. I ordered a Hong Kong Tea.Hong Kong tea is a hot beverage made of tea that is from boiling the Ceylon tea leaves in the tea kettle so the acid can infuse in the clear brown liquid. It is strong. To smooth out the caffeine loaded drink, cream or Carnation condensed milk or the Eagle's brand sweet condensed milk is added to enhance the flavour. The concoction is a heavy but smooth acid laced tea with a strong body. It is like drinking a cup of strong coffee. Its uniqueness rivals with the Indian Chai or the Vietnamese Coffee which use heavy cream or condensed milk to smooth out the acid. Interestingly, all such beverages are evolved from their humble beginning of the colonials trying to emulate their colonial masters' refined beverages, but brewed over the time span of an Empire to perfection. i can assure you that this unique beverage is not served in the Peninsula Hotel in TST. If you are into unique drinks, i strongly recommend this hot beverage. I bet you that it is available in hotel restaurants also, but you have to ask for it."

We had pre-booked dining in a box and it was fantastic value, about $60 Aus including buffet meal, unlimited beer, wine, softdrink, etc. Betting facilities were right nearby and the staff were very friendly and helpful (as we filled in our betting slips incorrectly just about every time!!) The view was fantastic as the stands are right against the track so everything is really close. Went to the parade ring and watched a race up against the fence - the horses were much closer than in Melbourne. Was fantastic. Would highly recommend - if you take your passport and go to the members gate you can pay HK$100 (about $12 Aus) and get into the members enclosure. The VRC at Flemington has a lot to live up to!!!

Extremely well organised of course like everything in HK with plenty of event staff on hand to help you place your bets.The only downside of the night was getting home (if you're staying on Kowloon). As Happy Valley is on HK island, none of the taxi drivers want to go back to Kowloon that late at night and we found ourselves stuck.My husband came up with the bright idea of getting a taxi to HK Central MTR (as taxi drivers WOULD take us there) and then MTR'ing it back to Kowloon. Other than that, well worth a visit."

It's ten Hong Kong Dollars to get in (82p). Drinks are expensive though but plentiful. Didn't bet myself but I believe it's easy enough and there's automated machine bettting too. If you're at a loose end on a Wednesday night, it is THE thing to do: the atmosphere is electric! The ability to get close up to the horses and feel the cheering rise up into the Hong Kong night sky makes it a floodlit experience like no other.TIP: Take a happy valley ding ding tram for 2.3 HKD (that's about 20p and a joy to the ears of us on budgets), take it all the way to the end of the line. On alighting, move forward and round to the right where the entrance ot the race course becomes apparent - Octopus can be used to get in too."

Very atmospheric and the view from the Jockey Club Balcony is thrilling. You get the pulse of racing in the blood evening if like me you are not a betting person. The betting system is not clear as there are more opaque betting options but they must be types of accumulator. Just a lovely environment without the hassle of crowds if you go for the Jockey Club evening. It is the same feeling as a cabaret night out.Our Lord taught me to trust him for all my needs and not to attempt to get rich quick but some people never learn this and horseracing is not a pleasure but a headache of trying to pick winners and getting desparate when that fails.Think of good food, a visual spectacle and take good company with you but you should meet no aggression on this trip.Chris, Anna & Jordan"

There is also Sha Tin racecourse where you can walk to the area in the middle of the tracks and picnic."

Each race lasts for a little over a minute, and it's about 30 minutes between races. Most of the fun comes from the anticipation, scouting out the horses before the race and listening to dreamers scream out their lucky numbers in hopes of being able to spur their selected horses on to victory.The atmosphere is alive and the track is a pretty fun place to hang out with your friends or co-workers. I can see why the locals like coming here."

Because we were tourists, we showed our passport at the ticket office near the members entrance and paid just 100 HKD (so around $12AUD) which gave us access to the general area as well as part of the members stand, including level two and the arena where the horses parade before the race. My only complaint would be the quality of food offered in the cafeteria on the second level ... a bit average but I suppose what do you expect for around $8. Even though we didn't back any winners, we had a great night out."

I have been several times and would recommend going to the public enclosure at track level rather than to one of the restaurants to get the most from the experience. Entrance here is just HKD10 and there are plenty of options to get food and drink.There are normally around 8 races and betting is a tote system which may seem a little complicated at first but there are assistants around to help and those taking the bets are very patient when you fill the betting slip in incorrectly (which I did most of the time). The minimum bet for each race is HKD10 and so it need not be an expensive night with the excitement of some potential winnings to come.The setting is quite special in the middle of urban Happy Valley which seems to add to the buzz. Giant outdoor screens in the centre of the track allow you to follow the action at all times.Traffic to Happy Valley can be very congested so plan ahead to male sure you arrive in time.Thoroughly recommend it."

Bets are easy to put on, almost as easy as going to the beer tents dotted around the track - if you like lots of drunk Westerners yelling and dribbling beer, then you'll like it here. If you detest that, maybe you'd do better visiting on a weekend or the Sha Tin race course (event meetings alternate between the two venues, which you can check on from the Hong Kong Jockey Club's website for an up to date schedule)."

To help you choose your horse they provide free form guides/tip sheets which came in useful. Beer garden sells different beers at very reasonable prices ($34 for a pint of San Miguel) and the chicken kebabs were very tasty and filling. Unless you are travelling by road then there's no real need to leave before the last race as recommended by some as it's about a 15 minute walk back to the MTR and I didn't experience any big crowds or queues at the station.

The Hong Kong Jockey Club has a weekly meet at the Happy Valley racecourse on Wednesday nights year round except during summer (approx June to Sept) as the weather is too hot and humid for the horses. Apparently, a weekly meeting sees more bet than the entire Spring Racing Carnival in Australia including the Melbourne Cup! We entered General Admission which costs HK$10 (US$1.20) to get in and allows you to go anywhere you want on the ground level next to the final straight. There are a bunch of beer stalls and lots of cheap food options here including McDonalds (!), plus plenty of betting stalls. What is surprising is that it's quite easy to get a spot right up on the rails, which will allow you to really feel the horses thunder by when the races are on. The expats will generally hang out next to the rails on the grass and will treat this as more of a social affair, while the locals tend to take the punting sheets and betting a bit more seriously. The night starts around 7 or 7:30pm and the last race is around 11pm. Happy Valley is an easy 10 minute cab from Central (which might cost around HK$40 or US$5-6) or you could catch the tram which will drop you right outside the main entrance. The traffic can be a bit busy after the last race so you could consider leaving after the second last race to beat the crowd."

At the back of the boxes was a betting counter so that you could easily place bets. There was also a fabulous buffet that you could help yourself to with lovely chinese and european food. All drinks were included and your glasses were top up as soon as they started to get low. We were then taken down to the winning line to watch the end of a race from the winners enclosure. The setting for the course is breathtaking a large green track surounded on all sides by sky scrappers. I would have happily spent 3 or 4 nights here it was easily the best night we had in Hong Kong and I would love to visit again."

After arriving in Hong Kong and already feeling this strange nostalgia for New York we then discovered the Happy Valley Racecourse. Wow.Bright green grass, pitchers of beer, foreigners / ex-pats everywhere, asian men gambling to their hearts content... all surrounded by the Hong Kong skyscraper jungle.If you're in Hong Kong and the races are going on (I believe they happen on Wednesdays, but read other reviews to be sure) this is a must."

Just a short taxi ride from our hotel to the course, and entrance fee paid by Octopus $10 which is just so cheap (around $2 in NZ money). Like everything in Hong Kong, entry to the venue was efficient. We are not into horse racing at home, but enjoyed the HK experience just wandering around the public area, and into the stands, seeing the horses parade, race and the lights. Food was a chicken kebab from a stall which was all we needed and we resisted the temptation of McDonalds. While there, there was an Australian/New Zealand wine promotion, so tried a local NZ wine (served in a plastic cup). Races every half hour, and the time between these goes quickly. Rather than wait for a tram, again returned to hotel by taxi, the queue for taxis looked rather long, but it moved very quickly."

            "review": "Fun, even if horse racing is not your thing. Getting there was a little hassle, took the MTR from TST area, but the MTR station near the Happy Valley Course is far away from the actual stadium. took us nearly 20 minutes to walk and of course the non-member entrance is the furthest away around the stadium. Entry was easy and cheap with the octopus card. We came around between the 3rd and 4th races, so there were no lines. There was a wine festival when we went, so we bought a pass to try 8 wines from 6 different countries, nice deal. Also had a kebab and a sausage platter. Good price and quality for stadium food. Made a few bets, it was confusing trying to make those, but there are staff attendants to fix any mistakes when you place them. Collecting was easy. We left just after collecting our bets from the 7th race. jumped onto a packed tram which we were told was going somewhere else, but managed to get off at an MTR station anyway, and make it back to our hotel. I'm not the biggest fan of horse racing, but this night out was a lot of fun for the atmosphere and people watching. Would be a great date place for me."

You therefore shouldnt miss to visit one of the best places for this in hk: the happy valley racecourse.its located in happy valley which is easy to access by public transport. The tram is only one of various possibilities to reach it.HK people may watch the races on tv and bet using the internet but for me its simply not the same. The racecourse has enough stands to oversee the races and an entertaining and exciting evening is pretty guaranteed.The place is also good to meet people, if you stay in hk for a longer period. On Wednesday a lot of interns meet-up there."

            "review": "It's a great night. I had recently visited Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore and being a bit of a punter, I was looking forward to this night as the highlight of my trip and it didn't disappoint.First of all, it does require some planning to get there if you choose public transport. I was staying in Mong Kok so I took the MTR to Admiralty then changed onto the Island Line and got off at Causeway Bay. Was about a 10-15 minute ride from there to the track.I did go for the HK$100 tourist member pass but in hindsight, all you need is the general HK$10 entry. The first couple of races were reasonably quiet, I noticed that after most people came between the 2nd and 3rd races and the racecourse filled up very quickly so it was difficult to get a seat in the grandstand, so get in early and get a seat if you need one.The racecourse was really well set up. It was an interesting mix. The Chinese origin crowd tended to occupy the members seats near the finish line while the ex-pat crowd seemed to favour a \"party area\" down near the 200 metre mark where there were several beer tents and music playing between races.Also in that area were staff from the HKJC who were helping put bets on.All in all, I had a great night (probably helped by the fact that I backed 2 winners at reasonable odds. It's always good to leave the track with more money than what you went with). I left the track after the 2nd last because my feet started getting sore. As I was leaving, I noticed a very long taxi line beginning to form with very few (none actually) taxis at the rank. I grabbed a tram back to Wan Chai and caught the MTR back to Mong Kok so I would suggest you look at finding an alternate means to leaving at the end of the night than a taxi because you could be waiting for a while."

As we were walking around the stadium to that gate, we did notice the swankier crowd entering through other gates. I don't know if this was for the tourist level or not. We were at track level and as you enter on your left, just past the McD's stand there are a bunch of gentlemen in blue jackets standing there to help you place bets. We had never been to a horse race before and we quite clueless. They spoke English well and were very helpful. The gentleman who helped us was very friendly and infectiously happy. We were too after we won 3 out of 4 races we bet on! Go - you can't not have fun!"

            "review": "Fun, but chaotic. As with the last reviewer, what should have been an excellent evening was heavily marred by an incomprehensible labyrinth of corridors, lifts and zones. With hindsight, we shouldn't have bothered with the faff of taking our passports to obtain tourist passes, and we should have stuck to the public areas further down the course. From what we could see the public area had plenty of facilities and was close enough to the start/finish line to get in on the action. By contrast, with the tourist pass you are left wandering around the members section trying to find somewhere that you are allowed to sit/eat/bet. You had no idea whether a guard would welcome you into a zone or block your way. To aid matters, most lifts went to different selections of floors and seemed to be a bit random.The web site appears slick, but ultimately didn't offer us much practical info as to what to book. Having been there, it seems that there are some 'loges', pairs of seats with mini tables that overlook the start/finish lines, that appeared to be quite popular. If I went again then I'd look into booking one of those.All that to one side, seeing night time horse races surrounded by tower blocks is a very unique experience, and we are glad we did it, even though we were completely knackered from endless wandering."

            "review": "Disappointing; confusing evening with 30 minutes between each race. We had a different experience from other reviewers; we found many of the staff unable to speak English. This was problematic, because upon entering we didn't know where to go (the Members/(tourist) section has a horrible layout with a patchwork of permitted/off-limit areas on different floors). We also didn't know how to bet, and then we had a hard time finding the apparently lone ATM location.With a lot of patience, perseverance, and walking we got betting instruction pamphlets and HK$2 pens from the 1st floor information desk. We then still filled out the wrong betting slips (there are different ones that look almost identical depending on whether you're using a machine vs a teller). We finally placed some bets, only to learn you have to sit around for 30 minutes between each race.The food in the Members III section was limited to mostly a small selection of meat + rice. The grandstand was smoky.Even getting to Happy Valley is confusing. If you take the bus from Admiralty and get off at what appears to be the racecourse stop, you are actually on the exact opposite side of the track and must walk ~1 mile around to the entrance.Overall, very disappointing after seeing Happy Valley rated as HK's #4 attraction."

Im not that into horseracing but totally loved it, seeing the horses in the parade ring before the races was fab.We had to ask how to fill in the race slips and the staff were very helpful and spoke perfect English too!We paid the 100 dollars to get into the members area (tourist pass) but we actually spent most of our time in the non members area so i dont think we really needed the tourist passes to be honest!There are a lot of regulars and if they put their newspapers over the seats (so they can go and put on bets) then dont sit in those seats!! we made that mistake and had an unhappy Chinese man come back to the seats we had sat in!! oops!Anyway, all in all a great fun night out and we won 4 races out of 8 which was fab!!"

            "review": "Great night out!. On my 2nd trip to Hong Kong I was finally able to make it to this in town race course for the Wednesday night races. And what a fun experience it was!One of our group found out that for HK100 (approx 13USD) you can get a \"tourist\" pass for the racecourse. This essentially allows you access to most areas of the course including the parade area and the standing space right by the finish line. It's easy to get the pass - just go into the lodge box entrance (not the main gate at the end) and you will see a sign for \"tourist passes\" The staff behind the window will check your passport (to make sure you have HK stamp) and then give you a small tag to attach to your shirt or pants once you have paid the fee. Inside the course you can get the racing forms and booklets. Placing bets was easy, although some of the options are different. In addition we discovered after a few races that it seems to be easier to win, so make sure you keep all of your tickets and bring them back to the window to double check. The only down side to the night was the food - we waited until late in the card to eat and didn't have very many options. I would suggest eating early or elsewhere. Getting to the course was easy - you can take the MTR to Times Square and once you are outside there are fairly obvious signs to the track. It is about a 10 min walk - you can also just get a cab ride which we did after with no problem. Finally on the night we were there the infield was full of beer tents and games for \"Octoberfest\" It seems like most weeks they have some sort of promotion or fun activity in this area. While this makes the racing some what less serious, it is a great distraction for those less interested in the horses. As a result we felt that the course had something for everyone in our group - the serious fans watches the races, reviewed the horses and made a few bets, while the rest of us enjoyed a few beers, met some interesting people and enjoyed the great night view. I would highly recommend adding this to your HK plans - I'm just sorry it took me a second trip to get out there!"

As Horse racing enthusiasts we couldn't resist the temptation of a little flutter when we found that there was a meeting at Happy Valley during our stay in Hong Kong.It was a Wednesday night meeting and following threads in the forum we headed for the Causway Bay MTR station about 2 hrs before the first race.. as we knew there would be one or two going along :)As you exit the MTR, follow the signs for Leighton Road and then the floodlights can be seen in the distance. It was well sign posted but by this time the crowds had started and we just followed along. We made our way to entrance E, the Members main entrance, where upon presentation of your passport you get a Members Day pass for 100 HKD. This entitles you to go anywhere in the massive stadium where a member can go. Any doubts on where that is, is easily decided by the vast number of staff on hand to help you. Everyone spoke English and the betting was explained and we sat above the winning post in the members enclosure. It was breathtaking looking up at the 9 or 10 storey high stands with all the punters duly awaiting the horses.Programmes in English were available and there was numerous food counters and coffee bars. There was a 'pomp' surrounding the occaision where the horses are led out by riders in a red uniform and the winner is then led to show off in front of the crowd. It was a fantastic evenings entertainment and another tick in the box.PS.. 1 winner & 3 places but the night was the winner :)"
