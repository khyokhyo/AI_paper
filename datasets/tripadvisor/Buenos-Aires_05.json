The process was a bit involved since we wanted to make sure we got good value and good seats which involved using two websites, simultaneously comparing the seats view to the price. Booking involved using a credit card and it said you must bring a Passport to claim your tickets which we did a couple of hours before the show and did not end up needing to use our passport- it was an machine, not unlike an ATM, where you swipe the CC you used to book tickets and they printed out immediately. The theatre is beautiful. The show was great, with Spanish and English subtitles. We ended up leaving after the third intermission because we were tired and hot- for some reason there was zero air flow so even on a cool evening where you needed a jacket outside, the theater itself was hot and stuffy. They served drinks during the three intermissions but did not have flat water, another reason we left at the third act. I would not visit again but I would recommend to anyone to visit at least once. We paid about 30usd for our tickets and our seats were a good view in the center."

We arrived just in time for the English tour. The guide was very knowledgeable. We enjoyed every minute of our time with her. The building is magnificent and filled with history. During our visit they were checking the sound system for an opening performance. Although we could not take photos in the theater, we had the opportunity to listen to voices both loud and whispered. What amazing acoustics! Try to attend a performance. It will to be fantastic."

Better to book in advance either online or just stop in to the tour office in the back. Good lecture on the history of the place and your visit includes going into the theater.If you can arrange tickets to a show, I would recommend you do it. I believe you can book online.

Visiting Teatro Col\u00f3n, if possible, is a delight; a 50-minute visit that goes through the main halls, corridors, balcony and take a peek at the actual theater, along with interesting information about it's construction, renovation and details. The tour guide is polite and did a great job conducting the tour. It really makes you want to watch an opera or a music presentation at that marvelous place.One downside is perhaps the ticket sales, the cashier was a bit rude, did not ask for a language preference, and after we were done with our visit, we noticed a very, VERY long line to get tour tickets (something we managed to avoid by getting there early) - which indicates they are either understaffed or really not caring too much about their job.Nonetheless, get in there in the first tour hours, ask for the language options, and you'll have a great time."

It is ranked the third best opera house in the world by National Geographic and is acoustically considered to be amongst the five best concert venues in the world. Even though there are guided tours to visit it, I strongly recommend you to buy a ticket (it is not necessary an expensive one, a cheap one will also do!) and assist to one of the concerts or operas that are always of excelent quality. You will be surprised by the atmosphere of the place, an amazing music cathedral."

El Teatro Col\u00f3n is not only the usual expression of arts and comedy that a visitar would find in any major European-style or North American city. It's one of the most vivid examples of a time when Argentina was a rising economic power, at the top 10 of wealthy nations of the world. It's facade hides a world of its own, layer under layer of workshops, stages, dressing rooms, practice halls, etc. As a theatre it has one of the best accustics in the the world. It's guided tours leave every 15 minutes, every day of the week, from 9am to 5pm."

Ten steps ahead of us two patrons entered and two steps from the door the stooge at the door (who clearly saw us) set the two pillars in front of the doors. He told me the taquilla was closed, gesturing toward the pillars in a condescending fashion. I showed him my phone, the clock on the wall and even his own watch, which said it was not yet 8PM. We were turned away, the door shut in our face. I was told to go around the corner for any complaints. The staff was unsympathetic and when they told a supervisor that we had been rejected in that fashion, she said \"Well I wasn't there so how do I know?\" Unbelievable! Frankly, I found this experience appalling. The show had not yet started and yet we were told to pound sand, maybe come back tomorrow (when the show would be long over) to complain further to some other jerk who would surely offend us further simply for wanting to hand him our money. This sort of arrogance supports stereotypes about Argentinians, and in a place that is a symbol of national pride and identity."

Despite availability of tickets online for whatever reasons the ticket office stopped selling tickets for the tours with no explanations. Undeterred I went back a couple of days later for a performance by one of the pianists that I like. As I was unable to pay on line I went straight to the box office and bought a ticket two hours before the concert. I took my place in the auditorium and after thirty minutes wondering why the performer didn't look like the pianist I remembered ... I realized that the programme had been changed due to illness of the pianist (not the theatre fault) but that no one had bothered letting me know when I bought the ticket (very very bad customer service especially when you expect to see a specific performer !!!) even though the pianist had been sick for two days and replaced in past performances already. So basically I ended up paying 100 usd to see a pianist I didn't see in the end. On the plus side : the replacement pianist was also amazing and everything written about the theatre is true : great acoustics, the excitement of being in a world class venue, opulence beyond belief ...as an opera and music fan it was a real treat !Note : theatre doesn't take Visa cards with chips either online or at box office"

The theater tickets are only available online with a 'visa' card - no other! We collected from the ticket office the day before. Theater was packed acoustics great. We were up in the God's to one side and in front row - perched on the edge of seats to view. The better tickets sold out. Ours were about $850ars each. Very good performance. You can also get seats higher that mean you stand up for the performance for Ars $130. With no legal room to spare and our tickets- may have been better viewing from the cheap seats? Thankfully no interpreter required for Opera Orchestra or ballet! Free city WiFi nearby to order uber.GO"

Our knowledgeable and friendly English-speaking guide was excellent.Only disappointment was that at c.50minutes we felt the tour could have been longer - and perhaps included seeing the vast workshops, rehearsal studios and inner workings of the theatre.Definitely worth doing though, a stand out marvel in the city."

We had purchased tickets to the Opera, but due to flight delays we were unable to make the show. Although the box office would not refund the tickets or give us access to another show (sold out), they did give us tickets to a rehearsal of the Philharmonic. There are tours offered, but try and get any rehearsal tickets if you can, they are FREE!! The theater itself is very beautiful, I was told it had a face lift not to long ago. We sat in very a nice balcony box #3, and had no issues with the view. The acoustics are amazing and just being there while a performance is going on is magical. You can get there by metro, there is a stop across the street."

We booked tickets for a \"Funcion Extraordinaria,\" which is a show by the secondary cast (understudies), so the nicer seats were more affordable. We booked seats in the Plateau (main floor), row 17 and had a fantastic view. To pick up the tickets an hour before the show I had to show my passport and credit card. The opera was in Italian and translated into English and Spanish above the stage so we could follow along. If you book the nicer tickets (plateau etc) you can also enter through the beautiful main entrance and access the grand halls during the intermissions. There's also a subway stop right out front and we easily caught a cab home afterwards. There's a dress code but we were more casual (dress shirt, no tie, dress etc) and we didn't have an issue with this particular show. Definitely book tickets to an opera if you can. Wonderful experience. Well worth it."

The tour, which takes about 50 minutes and can be done in English or Spanish, is well worth the time and cost.

Our guide was knowledgeable and friendly, and urged us to try and see a show if we could (sadly, I could not).

If you can't at least take the guided tour. Enjoy music with five senses. Look up and revel at the marvellous allegory painted in the cupola by Ra\u00fal Soldi in 1966 (the original one had deteriorated by 1930s). Drink champagne in the foyer. Touch the costumes and the props. Smell the thrill and nerves before each opening. Listen to the still silence onstage. Do not miss the jewel of a foregone country.

The fee is a cheap U$S 5 for local residents and a little more for foreigners. Knowing all other Opera Houses in the world I would (in his time category) rate the exquisitely renovated Teatro Colon as the best lyric theater in the world, if you take in acount the refinement, luxury, overall beauty and good taste of the building which goes up to the smallest detail. Unluckily the Colon doesn t have actually the money to bring the top performers, which by the way, say it has the best accoustic. Nonetheless is almost always sold out, so plan carefully if, besides the visit, you would like to attend a concert. As you will be told in the guided visit the marvelous Colon could only have been buid due to the inmense wealth and affluence Buenos Aires and Argentina had hundred years ago. In an inside alleway, originally destined for the carriages of the rich elite, you can buy your ticket and also have a drink in the cafeteria."

We booked to see Daniel Barenboim conducting three Mozart Symphonies.On arrival, the collecting of our tickets and being guided to our seats in one of the balconies was very abrupt and unfriendly.The Theatre is truly magnificent and the acoustics outstanding.The Buenos Aires Symphony Orchestra oozed enthusiasm and played extremely well obviously enjoying Barenboim leading them. Their playing was perfect.Prior to commencement of the performance there is an announcement regarding cessation of flash photography and the turning off of mobile phones. Though in Spanish it could have been made in Ancient Egyptian for throughout the performance the flash photography never ceased. Accompanying this was the nonstop, various, totally annoying mobile phone tunes sounding and, to our horror, being answered both by text AND verbally.We were amazed and disgusted at such ignorant behaviour which we would consider very poor etiquette and insulting towards the Orchestra.When we come here again, even if it was our very favourite orchestral work, we would not go as the performance is spoilt by people who should know better and curb their habits."

            "review": "It's a miracle to have such a theater in Buenos Aires. A couple of months ago I took my 10 year-old grandson to visit it. He was reluctant to go but, when I said to him that it is one of the very best in the world, he said: \"Are you kidding?\" and added: \"One of the finest and it's here in Buenos Aires?\" (and that gave me the idea for itle tittle of the review. The theater is nothing short of impressive, inside and out. Nevertheless, I like it more inside. Designed by two Italian architects(Tamburini and Meano) who died while it was being built, it was finished by a Belgian one, named Jules Dormal. It took 28 years to pass from a pile of blueprints to inaguration day on the 25th of May 1908. (with Verdi's Aida)We had to take a tour in Spanish. Unfortunately, as it was a Sunday there were no discounts for local kids or retired people, as I am. Did they expect he was going to miss school? (ridiculous)The guide showed us around, but I perceived he had an \"attitude\" against the rich. I can't remember his exact words, but he said it had been built by the elite for the elite. I said to him something like: \"Where on Earth in the 19th Century were Operas built for peasants or working class people?\" And he said something like: \"You have a point\"Further on, he mentioned the arrogance of those who decided to build such a huge theater (slightly under 3,000 spectaors) One more time, I had to make him think about what he had said. \"Arrogance?\" and I compared it to the Opera in Montevideo -inaugurated in 1857- which is smaller(1,000 spectators) but, compared to the population of the city at that moment, was proportionally more \"arrogant\".(Montevideo had slightly more than 30,000 people at that time)Despite those two minor problems with him, generally speaking, it was ok.I have attended opreas at the Col\u00f3n, but I'm not an accoustics expert. Nevertheless, they say it's -at least for opera- one of the best.It looks so beautiful inside that I recommed foreign visitors to go and visit it...even more: they shouldn't miss it."

Our English-language guide was a delightful young Argentinian who herself was studying music at the university level, so her tour was punctuated with wonderful musical anecdotes. The architecture and appointments in the theater's interior are simply breathtaking, reflective of an age of splendor the world may not see again for a very long time."

            "review": "A MUST-SEE FOR VISITORS TO BUENOS AIRES. One of the top attractions of Buenos Aires is Teatro Colon, the main opera house in Buenos Aires. Opened in 1908, it is considered among the best opera houses in the world both acoustically and architecturally. Guided tours of the building in English are offered only a few times a day and sometimes sell out quickly. It is a good idea to buy your tour tickets in advance at the box office. Our purchase required a major credit card and our passports for identification. The purchase price for foreigners is ARS200 ($200 Argentine pesos) which translated into about USD$14.29 each at the time of our visit - very reasonable.We arrived at Teatro Colon on a Friday morning and were told that they were running lighting tests that day and that the main auditorium might not be illuminated as a result. We felt that would be a bad choice as the main attraction of the building is the main hall where operas are performed so we opted to purchase out tour tickets for the following Monday and were very glad we did - as the main hall is spectacular and it would have been a real pity to miss it. Our tour guide was a personable young man named Emanuel whose English was flawless and who was not only full of information about the opera house and its history but who seemed to genuinely like what he is doing - which makes any tour anywhere more enjoyable. We not only got to see part of this wonderful structure, but learned quite a bit about its history. The group itself was made up of only about 25 people which made it more personal and easier to connect with the guide with any questions. The highlight of the tour for me was when we were in the main hall (with groups both in front of and behind us) Emmanuel asked if anyone would like to sing. I figured life is short and when would I ever have a chance to do this - so I quickly planted myself in front of the stage and sang the first line of \"La donna \u00e8 mobile.\" I then told our guide in Spanish that I could die a happy man being able to say I had sung opera at Teatro Colon ;-)I gave the tour only four stars out of five for three reasons: first because we found the 40-minute tour a bit rushed, with other groups both in front of and behind us. It was at times difficult to pay attention to everything our guide was saying and take the photos we wanted to take without being rushed forward by a guard. I understand that there is a need to keep groups moving in order to accommodate everyone who wants to view the building, but not being able to linger was a disappointment. Also we had thought we would get to see some of the \"behind-the-scenes\" areas - but the only areas which were shown were those that would be accessible to the general public the day of a performance. Lastly, there was a young couple in our group who thought it was appropriate to bring an infant and young child with them which was at times distracting (with the baby crying). At risk of incurring the wrath of young parents everywhere, I don't think it would be unreasonable for the theatre to impose some sort of minimum age restriction for the tour. Other than for those three things, this was an excellent, informative tour with an excellent guide and it should be on the list of any visitor to Buenos Aires."

With its plus red velvet seats with gold embellishments. Grand stair cases, amazing box seats and a stunning blue azure round ceiling. The acoustics is amazing I sat in a boxed seat in vieja 4 with 5 others. It was spectacular."

Although those tickets don't offer you much of a view (they're off to the side of the stage), you get to hear the hall in action...and it is worth it, believe me!! The clarity of the individual instruments in the orchestra is incredible, and so detailed - in fact, you can hear audience members whispering on the other side of the auditorium when it's quiet....!Appreciate this won't be an option available to everyone, as it will depend on what's on when you're in BA, but thought it was worth highlighting for those that aren't aware (as we weren't). :-)"

Of course it is a bit early in the season. The acoustics are superb. If you go on one of the guided tours the enthusiastic team will explain all of this. Take a look at the brass grills behind which widows would sit so they could not be seen in public (until 1950!).They will point out the massive chandelier 38 metres above your head and where there is space for 15 or so musicians to play instruments in pieces where \"heavenly\" music is desired.I think it was Placid Domingo who said something like \"this is a challenging theatre - so good are the acoustics that any mistakes in your performance will be amply reproduced.\""

Magical performance but also great to see the stylish Argentine audience out and about. Plenty of opportunity to grab a drink and wander around the theater. Programs are Spanish only so read up on what you're going to see before you get there if you don't speak the language. They tell you to arrive 30 mins before the performance and this absolutely necessary. It's a big theater with one entrance and it takes a while to get in and get settled. I purchased \"best available\" and it was a great seat but was in a box with 5 other people (a local family celebrating a birthday) and the ticket agent didn't mention that I was in a box and it's not apparent on the seating map. Don't even waste your time on the Teatro Colon website to buy your own ticket. It's a mess requiring registration and is known to be very unreliable. Go to the box office or get your concierge to handle for you."

The production was absolutely superb. The theater is gorgeous, and the whole experience was wondrous. This said, I am writing to warn visitors about purchasing box seats. As all experienced opera-goers know, if you don't purchase the two seats in the front of the box, then you are better off going elsewhere -- anywhere else, because you don't see a thing from the back of the box. Of course, we did this, and paid extra for those two seats. However, unlike all other opera houses we have been to around the world (e.g., St. Petersburg, Rome, Vienna, etc.), when you get to the performance, none of the seats within the box have a number, so there is no way to \"prove\" which seats you purchased. In this instance, we arrived early and took our two front seats, but had we come a bit later, the other occupants of the box would have surely taken them, and this would have created a very unpleasant experience, as you can imagine. Indeed, we sat in the seats all through the intermission for fear of losing them. So, at this theater, get there early! Separately, the tour of the theater (as opposed to attending a performance) was pretty mediocre, and showed very little (nothing backstage)."

The tickets can be obtained directly in the Theater, for that you have to use the side entrance, it was in that moment when I realized it wasn't a normal building (you have to see it). We were lucky enough to be in group with elderly people, and not to sound like a clich\u00e9 but they are the wisest and while I silently contemplated the art and architecture splendor (and took pictures of course) they asked the smart questions. We were told about the history of the place, the significance of the little details that are everywhere in the art, and more importantly, about the people that attended, their life and love stories. While we ascended and started cruising the halls, our tour-guide perfectly whistled classical tunes, while quizzing us and telling us little known facts about them. It was these little attentions that made the evening special, we were all engaging and interacting, laughing and remembering, while experiencing, more that watching, the building. Finally we reached the gallery that showed us the view of the stage, it was like in those good dreams you don't want to wake up from, but eventually you know you have to, well, we tried to prolong it as much as possible, asking for recommendations and gossip, but it was inevitable, we woke up, back to the modern world. After that I attended ballet and concerts, to say the least they were amazing, but not quite like that first guided-tour. Maybe it was the group that just clicked, but I will never forget that experience."

On our last visit, I was too slow to get our standing room tickets for the ballet. Since it was the farewell performance of a much loved ballerina, the concert was thoughtfully relayed onto an enormous screen outside, where hundreds of chairs had been set up for those, like me, unable to get tickets. If you are travelling on a shoestring, check out the free concerts; the one we attended on a Sunday morning was a program of tango music performed by local musicians which was so spectacularly good that I felt guilty not paying."

A brilliant night. Top Tip...The ticket office told me that I needed a white shirt and dark trousers as the dress code was enforced. Everybody else told me to relax and not worry, anyway I bought a Pink shirt and wore slacks. Have to say I looked sharp compared to all the jeans and leather jackets amongst the odd shirt and tie. So, don't panic, though I think they might demand a very smart appearance for their main events. Plenty of taxis after and the show was 3 hours starting at 8 pm.

It is a gorgeous concert hall and the acoustic is wonderful. We had tickets in Palco Balcon Centro 13. This is well situated inside the theater. However when I bought the tickets, it gave me the impression I was actually reserving specific seats, first row of the small six-seat area. However we realized too late, after visiting a bit the inside of the theater before reaching the balcony, that it is in fact first come first serve among the six-seat. A family of four had already taken the four best seats, and frankly one of the two left had a miserable view. We had to take turns standing, or sitting in the antechamber of the balcony to see, although you could enjoy the music anywhere with great pleasure. So my recommendation if you want to do more than visit the theater, and want to attend an event, get there early, line-up at the entry and go straight to your seats. you can visit after the show! I bought my tickets on line and all went very smoothly. the night of the event, you can pick-up your ticket at the box-office. You can either line-up to have them hand delivered to you, or use a very convenient automatic machine and swipe the credit card you used to purchase them, and it will right away print them out for you. It took 2 minutes to do it. Definitely worth a visit, if you cannot make it to a concert or other event. "

A beautiful theatre, well worth while attending -rather than just visiting- for a performance of either a symphonic or chamber music concert, an opera, or a ballet. I personally prefer a seat in the fourth floor, CAZUELA, where I can appreciate the most wonderful acoustics in full., though wherever I'm seated it's great to be part of the magic. There are, of couse, guided tours for those who are willing only to admire the premises, though it's a pity to miss the atmosphere of a live top rate performance, such as I enjoyed yesterday evening listening to fantastic mezzo soprano Joyce DiDonato, accompanied by Craig Terry (piano) in an unforgettable recital! There are a few events, specially Sunday mornings, free of charge; prices vary, naturally, according to the artists involved, but you always get value for money, and even standing room in the upper gallery is a great place to appreciate musical artistry!"

There were only two English tours a day when I was there and I arrived promptly for the 1:00 tour. Unfortunately, the ticket agent told me that the lights in the auditorium were not working today, and maybe tomorrow. I asked if that was bad, and he nodded Yes. So back two days later, but the 1:00 tour is at 3:00 today. I came back at 2:45 - and the tour was full. Pleaded with the ticket agent, but absolutely no extra people allowed. Leaving BA today, but arranged with one of the Casa Calma desk staff to get me a ticket for our one day stay prior to our return home. And it was well worth the hassle and wait and frustration. An excellent guide and a wonderful experience. We were lucky to see a couple rehearsing for tonight's ballet performance. Next time I will make sure that I attend an event at the Opera House. It's a world class venue and a jewl in the BA crown."

The Teatro Colon is really a gorgeous building. I haven't been here for many years since before they renovated it. It's really spectacular. The architecture is gorgeous. My wife and I came for Don Giovanni and it was really a wonderful show. I can't recommend this place enough and it should be on the top of the list of things to do while in Buenos Aires.We easily purchased the tickets online and simply picked up tickets at the box office the day of. We had one of the seats directly above the stage in a private room. Fortunately there wasn't anyone else in the box. The others around us there were up to 6 people and unfortunately unless you are in the front row of the box, you can't see anything. We saw the people next to us having to stand up to see it since they were in the back row.The show started at 8 PM sharp and there was an intermission for about 25 minutes. In all it was about 3.5 hours long. The show was in Italian but they had Spanish subtitles running above the stage. If you don't read Spanish you're out of luck on translation but still would be beautiful to experience and hear the amazing orchestra. Wonderful!"

I was lucky in tour there was Opera singer accompany visitor and she sang a little for us. Most memorable."

Our group of 34 (the group limit) were treated to a few minutes of the orchestra rehearsing Don Giovanni. That mixed with the stunning beauty of the interior nearly brought me to tears.

We had heard that it is one of the few opera houses in the world that has perfect acoustics. We bought tickets for an English tour and had enough time to go across the large 9 of July Avenue to have lunch first. The docent/tour guide we got was very articulate and extremely knowledgeable. The tour begins in the grand foyer with the beautiful mosaic floors, marble pillars and staircase and stained glass inset ceilings. It is rich and yet very elegant and understated. From here the 'wow' factor just keeps going up as you go upstairs and see the way the major composers are honored all around you. After seeing all the spaces outside the auditorium you are finally let into the piece de resistance which is the auditorium itself. It certainly lives up to its reputation and compares well to the famous European opera houses. The acoustics are, indeed, perfect. You can sit anywhere in the theatre and the sound is amazing. The chandelier has a secret which I will not divulge here. In deference to the culture in Argentina at the time the theatre was built, there are several widows boxes on the sides obscured by black wrought iron screens. Apparently, widows were expected to observe mourning for 2 years and could not be seen in public enjoying themselves! So they sat in these boxes where they could hear the performance but not be seen themselves. There is a section around the very top of the theatre for people to stand and watch for a much lower cost. Dress codes are still in effect at this opera house and patrons dress up to attend. One section of the place reminds you of the palace in Versailles with its elaborate gold decoration and mirrors. This theatre is a gem and well worth a visit."

I'd missed this when I was in Buenos Aires several years ago as it was undergoing extensive restoration, and so was eager to visit this time. I was not at all disappointed. The place glows! We had an excellent guide who clearly loved the building and was eager to share details of its construction and restoration, and point out the busts of various composers while explaining why they'd been chosen to be honored. We had the added treat of hearing the last few moments of a tenor's audition, in a room modeled on Versailles' Hall of Mirrors. In every respect this was a lovely visit; the Teatro Col\u00f3n is definitely a must-see."

The Teatro Colon (named after Christopher Colombus) is hands down the best theater I have visited. Not only does it have amazing acoustics (apparently the best in the world for opera) it also blinds us with its sheer beauty. The tour is also well guided and helps us to further appreciate the beauty of this theater. Do not miss this if you are in Buenos Aires. Definitely one of the biggest highlights of the city."

The theater itself is a national treasure and a tour of it will reveal Argentina's aspiration to outdo European high culture at its own game. The differing styles of the foyer, grand rooms and main hall will amaze you with their opulence and over the top decoration in various baroque, rococo and romantic styles. You must see it for yourself.PS; The opera was beautifully presented and sung although its subject matter and male nudity will shock many viewers. Ginastera's critique of aristocracy, privilege and the upper classes lack of \"family values\" is very modern for an opera and quite daring given that he composed it composed in the late 70's when Argentina's time of the generals had begun."

There are a lot of stairs (all marble) and the pace is fairly quick. The guide takes you through the various halls and lovely ante rooms and finally you're shown the incredible auditorium and stage. The ceiling frescoes and stained glass are stunning. The coolest part of the tour was when the guide actually went to the front of the auditorium and sang an aria for us.

We also got into the adjoining rooms and a rehearsal area, also explained by students. It would have been nice to see the stage and the flys. Had a sandwich after in the small cafe but it's more convenient than exciting. The city was much smaller when it was built, so the grandeur was all the more interesting when the times were consideed.

From the grand foyer with its stained glass ceiling to the long gallery area with grand chandeliers to the opera seating area and private boxes it is truly magnificent. The history of the Teatro Colon is as intriguing as the structure is magnificent. The aristocracy of Buenos Aires wanted a grand European style opera house and had a famous Italian design and oversee its construction. All the labour and hard work was done by Italian immigrants who weren't allowed to buy seats in the opera house but could only get standing room in the back of the upper balcony. However they had the last laugh as the Italian architect built the building in such a way that the acoustics were phenomenal but no so more than in the upper balcony standing room area. So the poor Italians had the best sound and even more importantly most operas were in Italian which they could understand but the upper crust of Buenos Aires society couldn't as they spoke Spanish. Lastly when the operas didn't appeal to the Italian standing room opera goers they pelted the aristocratic Spanish speaking opera goers in the lower seats with tomatoes and other similar fruits and vegetables."

We walked past the theatre several times and thought we should take the tour, but having read some of the reviews it seemed sensible to see if there was a performance on so we could enjoy the full experience. We certainly weren't disappointed with the interior as it was quite special. I would say though that the seating is a bit odd with one end being blocked off if you're at the 'wrong' end you have to get the whole row to stand to let you out if you need to go to the toilets - and the seats we were in weren't for those with long legs! That being said, the price of the tickets and the price of the tour were about the same so we were happy enough on the whole - I just wonder how safe those seats are in the event of an emergency. Definitely recommend either a show/performance or the tour to see the inside."

There are some costumes on display.We went into the large box on the first floor facing the stage. The cashier had warned that the auditorium would be dark except for the stage, as they were testing the lighting, which would have been disappointing; fortunately when we got to the auditorium the lights were on.The guide said that there were always daily tours of Teatro Colon except on Christmas and New Years Day."

There is even a widow's area...which our guide pointed out had the same entry as the musicians, end must have lead to many interesting encounters.The Colon has been renovated and everything from the paint to the stuffing in the seats (horsehair and cotton) has been taken back to original specifications.

In addition to its formal fall / winter season, the theatre historical centre holds special summer open air recorded performances presented on a large screen just next to the theatre in the \u201cParque Del Vaticano\u201d. And this is what I would like to quickly tell you about, as there are only a few remaining concerts for this summer season.Below is a list of some of those remaining concerts in case you are, or will soon be, in Buenos Aires and wish to experience one or more of these fascinating programs. [The full list is available at the theatre].Mozart\u2019s Requiem Mass in D minor [Feb 4] Verdi\u2019s Opera Aida [Feb 5] Zorba the Greek Ballet [Feb 6]Puccini\u2019s Opera Tosca [Feb 12]The three Tenors concert, recorded in Rome 1991 [Feb 13]Brecht-Weill\u2019s Opera \u201cMahagonny Songspiel\u201d [Feb 14]The festival, which started January 14, includes 19 concerts, Operas and Ballets from the world\u2019s best production companies. The performances start at 8 pm [but are canceled in case of rain]; they are free to the public and seating is on a first come first served basis. This festival is sponsored by the ministry of culture, who is forever striving [and succeeding] to offer the public, access to all types of high quality art and culture. I attended three performances and was so impressed that I wanted to make sure you know of the remaining ones. The first performance was a collection of Gershwin\u2019s work including the Rhapsody in Blue and An American in Paris. The second was the magnificent Beethoven\u2019s ninth Symphony in D minor and the third was Karl Orff\u2019s Cantata \u201cCarmina Burana\u201d which was simply fabulous. The three chosen performances were exquisite and very enjoyable, as I am sure the remaining ones will be. I hope you will have the opportunity to see some of the remaining performances.Have a great time."

Tours in English don't happen all that often. But it's worth waiting for. We had a knowledgable tour guide who was passionate about the Teatro. We listened to a history of the building that was interesting, sometimes funny, and definitely worth what we paid. My only complaint is that we didn't get to go backstage or see the dressing rooms. The season was over when we took our tour. If you're there when performances are available, I'd definitely recommend getting tickets. They're available at a wide variety of price points. It's an opportunity you won't likely have again!"

Given that it's over 100 yrs old and recently renovated the exterior is majestic, but you really do need to join a guided tour inside. The tour costs rougly $15 (about 200 pesos?). You must pay in pesos, and the tour lasts about an hour. There are steps, so if you have trouble climbing stairs you may want to reconsider taking the tour. There are elevators, but the tour did not appear to be handicap friendly. We did not sign up for the tour in advance and our wait for an English speaking tour was only about 30 minutes: Just long enough for a coffee in the coffee shop in the waiting area. Not sure if we were just lucky with this short wait or this is the norm. The tour guide was passionate & knowlegeable. She took pride in the facility and the cultural heritage of the Teatro. Very little info about the exterior architecture of the facility. Bottom line: It's worth investing an hour or two of your time."

I wanted to experience the glory of this old theater first-hand.Although our trip was to take place in December 2015, I tried to get tickets in September from their website (too frustrating) and finally contacted the theater by email. I promptly received a return email describing the best way to achieve seats. Although I experienced some difficulty in comprehending their procedure, I decided to pursue this challenge to the end.I finally contacted them by phone and was told that tickets would be available exactly one month from performance date and that there would be an English speaking person to assist me. Well, on the designated day I called Buenos Aires to discover that the English speaking person was not there!!! I was asked to call back in the afternoon or the next day. I could see my chances of getting good seats slipping away! With my mediocre Spanish and with intense concentration I volunteered to complete the transaction in Spanish by phone!Little did I know what extensive information would be required to secure these seats which would then be held at box office. They proceeded to collect my address, \"zeepcode\" (which took me a few minutes to work out), telephone numbers, email address and passport details! I must say the agent displayed extreme patience! Approximately one hour later I was the proud owner of good orchestra seats. The performance was to be EL CASCANUECES, which on translation I happily discovered we were to see the ballet Nutcracker. What a reward!!The ballet was a classic interpretation with superb attention paid to every detail. The costumes and scenery were breath-taking, the orchestra magnificent.The theater itself is incredibly beautiful, with six tiers of seating for 2500 audience capacity, lit up with subdued miniature chandeliers. To have the opportunity just to sit in the theater during a performance was in and of itself worth the ticket price of $110 per person.The performance was truly extra-special. All price levels of seating are available including standing room tickets at very reasonable prices.GO AND ENJOY THIS HISTORICAL AND EXQUISITE THEATER !"

The Teatro tour (approx 50mins) was terrific the building is just beautiful and the tour is well put together - worth the 180 Paseo ticket price, get their early and book your ticket. Whilst the website says every 15Mins there is a tour, you still have to get a ticket. We had to come back in 1.5 hours after purchasing a ticket for that next available group. I think our tour guides name was Palona or Polana - I can't recall. She was incredibly passionate in the way she brought the tour to life, using imagery to imagine what the theatre was like in the old days and also the historical account. She also put in a few subtle jokes that worked really well and most tourists who would be in a zombie like state at the end of most tours all left smiling and happy after our experience and our tour guide got a justly standing ovation applause at the end of the tour. Highly recommend attending this beautiful piece of eclectic architecture."

Granted it was summer in BA and I had just arrived from winter in Canada, but even my Argentine friends were mopping their brows. Make sure to have some water for a long performance.

I recently did the guided tour at Teatro Colon, Argentina's premier and historic opera house This was the third time that i had done a guided tour of this place, once when I was a child and then as a young adult. The biggest difference I saw was that they no longer show you the workshops and backstage, one of the best things their guided tours used to offer. However, the grandeur and opulence of the halls and main auditorium still makes it one of the highlights of visiting Buenos Aires. This is a must visit when visiting Buenos Aires for the first time."

I booked my ticket for Cascanueces/Nutcracker online then had to pick it up an hour before the performance. The website is a challenging experience but I somehow booked a ticket, though wasn't really sure what kind of seat I had. I was amazed, therefore, to find myself being guided to a box next to the stage, over the orchestra pit. The view was excellent. And so comfy. The dancers' performance of the ballet and the orchestra's playing were fantastic. I did not want it to end. The theatre is stunningly beautiful: red velvet, gilt, stucco plaster. A fantasy world of old time elegance. The staff are charming. The cafe is charming. Everything about the whole experience will charm you."

Best described as viewing the \"Andes on the Water\"'.re Teatro Colon, don't take a tour for approx $20. Buy a standing ticket for the top level for only approx $15 and leave after 30 minutes after experiencing the fantastic acoustics, the orchestra, the staging AND if you are in luck the singing. I say this because in my case 40 minutes of Parsifal (run time 5 1/2) was enought Wagner for the evening.If you want to watch a whole opera then buy a standing ticket one level from the top and move move into an empty seat the minute the curtain rises. That seemed to be the general practice the night I went. The same thing is possible at the top level but there are not nearly as many empty seats.Also in BA buy a SUBTE ticket (pronounced soon tay) and use the subway/underground. And get a map of the Subt.

If possible be there a little bit in advance so you get to look around the luxurious lobby, some interesting sculptures or memorabilia are sometimes exhibited. If you are lucky you will find the terrace open and you will get an absolutely magical view of the Plaza Dorrego and Buenos Aires. Even if you don't attend a show you can still book a guided tour through the labyrinthinc underground of the theatre and sneak peak costume and shoe workshops, among other trades that keep the theatre going. In the basement there is an experimental modern arts laboratory that also hosts cultural activities.

I saw two performances of Prokofiev\u2019s Fiery Angel and three performances of Wagner\u2019s Parsifal. Overall the experience was fantastic.The theatre is magnificent and deserves its reputation as one of the great theatres in the world. The design is beautiful and the acoustics are fantastic.The standard of the opera was very high including excellent production standards and singing. The orchestra was mediocre performing Prokofiev but much better performing Wagner (although still below the standard typical in Europe and US).However, the theatre does have one big flaw and that is that a significant number of seats on the sides have partial views of the stage, or you need to lean forward to see the stage properly (I would estimate 15-20% of all seats). Choose your seats carefully! I sat in different seats and felt it was worth paying extra to sit in the Platea. I booked a 720 peso ticket in the Cazuela Lateral and sitting back in my chair I could only see about 10% of the stage without leaning over the balcony. I spent most of the performance with my eyes closed! A couple of nights earlier I paid 310 pesos for a seat in the 1st Galeria Lateral which in my opinion was a better seat.Also, the performances of Parsifal started at 8pm and finished after 1am. I know Argentinians love late nights, but these late start times are crazy. Some locals must have agreed because many people had left by the time the third act started at midnight.For English speakers, some performances offer both English and Spanish surtitles, and some performances offer only Spanish surtitles. The English surtitles really increase the enjoyment so check with the theatre which performances are offering English.When I booked tickets at the beginning of 2015 the website didn\u2019t accept Mastercard, and therefore I needed to pay with Amex who charged me about $30 in fees that I wouldn\u2019t have paid if I had paid with Mastercard. It is hard to believe an international venue such as the Teatro Colon can offer such limited payment options, though it is fairly typical of Argentina\u2019s fragile economy where any financial transaction is an effort. Having said that, it does appear that the Teatro is now offering more payment options. Also, given that foreigners don\u2019t have the option of buying tickets at the box office and paying cash (and saving about 40% using the blue dollar), the experience of visiting the opera in Buenos Aires ended up being quite expensive and not very good value. In my opinion you can have the same or better experience in Europe/USA and pay less (or better still, for the cost of a 720 peso ticket you can buy seven 40 reais tickets to hear the excellent OSESP in Sao Paulo)."

Sitting in one of the most expensive lodges and hearing all about the history by this excellent English language guide. We are in luck that one of our group was an opera singer and were treated at a short life performance proving the absolute fine acoustics of this opera house."

It is one of the most beautiful opera houses in the world. If there was an opera house built next to the Palace of Versailles, this would be it. They recently completed a six year renovation and it's remarkable. I only wished I could have heard an orchestra and/or opera performance, but nothing was playing while I was in town. I was fortunate to hear the orchestra rehearsing for Parsifal and that was a treat. The tour is wonderful because it provides the history of the building and it helps you slow down and really take notice of the art and painstaking details that went into this masterpiece; details you may overlook if you were just coming to a performance. I'd recommend the tour and a performance if you have the time. If you happen to arrive early for the tour, there is a nice cafe to have a coffee or cold beer while you wait for the tour to begin. Exchange rates will fluctuate, but our tour was less than $20 USD per person to give you some idea of the cost."

We had a palco (box) on Level 4 (Cazuelo).The ticket said we had only a partial view of the stage, and this was true - but the only part we could not see without leaning over the rail was the far edge on our side (stage left).The acoustics, as promised, were perfect. We had the box to ourselves - another couple turned up but then went away!They service drinks and snacks at the bar during the intermissions, but you can't take them back to your box. I can see why, but it would have been nice.The singing and acting, of course, were world class.The production was new and used multi-media as well as traditional sets.But even during the intermissions the place is incredible - beautifully decorated like a European Theater in the 19th Century, but with comfortable seats.It didn't get to do the tour but will defiinitely do it on my next trip to the city. If you're not an opera fan, I recommend you still do the tour, just to see the architecture.They also do concerts and ballet."

Our guide had excellent English with only a slight accent. We toured the entry hall, the Golden Salon where people mingled before the shows and during intervals, and the main auditorium. The lights were off in the main auditorium because they were doing lighting tests for a performance, but the tests were interesting also. We sat in the large box used for dignitaries in the center of the horseshoe shaped hall, in the second level of balcony boxes. Our guide explained the circumstances of the construction, the materials used, the renovations done about ten years ago, and the significance of the varios ornate decorations. She related this to the social and cultural scene of the times with clarity and humor. At the end there was a small display of a few of the costumes made in the workshops on site. It was very informative as well as entertaining. There are stairs only at the beginning and end, with an elevator for anyone who has difficulty with stairs. There is a coffee shop next to the start of the tour. The tour itself was just under an hour."

The tour guide demonstrated a nice voice when he talked about the main composers whose profiles are displayed above the entrance on the first floor. Impressive marble staircase and stained glass foyer domed ceiling, even more impressive red velvet opera set.The only negative is the cafe is the main lobby - avoid eating there by all means. All the food is pre-made and just taken off the fridge when you order it, explanations about food items are scarce and ... there are cockroaches. There was one on the table when I sat and the waiter flicked it away before I could decide whether it was a pie crumb - but then I was 'attacked' by another roach, very alive and walking."

Most box seats have 6 chairs and are first come, first choice so I recommend getting there as early as possible if you want a good view. We were in Box 13 and five out of the six chairs had good views, the sixth did not. For an 20:00 show, the line started forming at about 18:30 and the doors opened around 19:15. I'm willing to wait in line for a once in a lifetime experience and felt sorry for the third couple in our box who showed up around 19:30. Definitely get there early.People were dressed very well but definitely NOT a black tie event, unless you were going to a gala.There is a small cafe serving coffee, tea, drinks and light snacks. The prices were very reasonable. In terms of cost, I thought tickets were a steal. Ours were about US$100.

It has the second best acoustic among theaters. Classic music sounds there but I have also seen popular music shows in this theater, like Paquito de Rivera or Tango players. It's an amazing experience. The Theater was created the 25th of May of 1908 and it's really big, occupies the whole square. The stop at this theater is mandatory If you visit Argentina."

We bought tickets for the guided visit at the ticket office at the entrance through Viamonte and Libertad streets. They offer a good tour in English and our guide Nazarena was very knowledgeable. It would have been even better if the tour expanded to the roof and the three sub-floors where they are still running classes of dance and art. We loved it so much that we atended to see 'Romeo & Juliet' as this was the only show on at the time. There was plenty of time to take pictures before the performance. I recommend to book your seats between the third and fourth floor oposite the stage where possible as there is better view. "

There were a few seats left here and there, mostly with limited or no view. In fact, we were surprised at how many seats actually had no view. So make sure you double check before buying.So, we opted for standing in the Paraiso (the highest level, 6 floors up). And what a good choice! The cheapest option turned out to have great unrestricted (but steep) view of the stage and auditorium. It is a free-for-all to get the best standing spot, so arrive early at the side door and leg it up the stairs quickly when the doors open. We were also surprised to see that the opera, Elixir d'Amor, came with both Spanish and English subtitles! The story was quite shallow but had some humour and it was a great first opera in a fantastic setting for us."

I saw Swan Lake (might of heard of it) and it was an incredible experience that I will never forget.A few tips for the novice Teatro Colon goer:- There is no a/c and it can get hot as hell in there. I've been several times and the ones in the winter were far more enjoyable.- Don't be stingy and get cheap seats. As other people have mentioned there are some awful seats in this place; I kid you not in some you can't see the stage. Shell out the extra coin and sit with the ballers.- In the bottom floor of the theater where will call is, there is a little restaurant/bar. I highly advise that you arrive at least an hour before the show and order you some bubbly. I lived in BA for over a year (no big deal) so I know what I'm doing and suggest you follow my sage advice."

We did a tour of the Teatro Colon, where they show you around and explain the voice of god section, etc. the best seats in the house for the view, the sound. etc. The guide also tells you about the conservation process they undertook, etc. very interesting. They also explained who would be sitting behind the grills at the bottom, and why the boxes are facing the way they do, etc. really nice little touches. We also went to an opera show there and it was brilliant! We got cheap standing tickets which I would recommend only if you're on a tight budget, they worked out to about \u00a35 each, but you are standing still the whole time which is quite uncomfortable, also worth getting some binoculars as the standing spaces are at the top and at the very back. Hope you enjoy! "

An iconic theater and probably the most visited tourist attraction in Buenos Aires today! And it sure deserves all that fame. The theater built in ecletic style, with a strong French inspiration, opened its door in 1908. It was closed for renovation in 2006, being reinaugurated by mid 2010. Amazing theater, beautiful decoration and very well maintained premisses. It can comfortably accomodate nearly 2.500 guests, plus 500 in standing positions. Check the guided visits: everyday from 9Am to 5PM. Tours on English and Portuguese languages are also available. If possible, try to buy your tickets (General Admission: AR$ 180) in advance, as each tour takes only 34 guests. We really enjoyed our tour and David, our guide, spoke a fine Portuguese (with a Rio de Janeiro accent - amazing!). The tour lasted one hour and we were able to visit the most important areas of fantastic \"Teatro Col\u00f3n\". Enjoy!"

We bought tickets on the Internet before leaving Europe. The prices varies a lot - and we chose quite low priced tickets on one of the upper balconies. The theater is very large and it's shaped more like a horseshoe that the half circles I'm used to from Europe. This means that sitting on the sides on the upper balconies you have to stand up to see more than 1/3 of the stage. But that's OK - everybody in these seats do stand during the performances.Another strange part. When you have seats in the three upper balconies you enter through a side door. It also turns out that you are disconnected from the main part of the public areas. I had hoped to see more of the building in the intermission and hoped to have a glass in the main area - but here there is really a class system. Cheap tickets means no access to the main areas.The accousticts are wonderful and the singers were all fantastic. The musical experience is good whatever seats you choose to buy."

I discovered this by looking at their website (in English) and then emailing (in English) to ask about tickets as they were not for sale on the site. It turns out that some shows are free and you have to go a few days in advance to pick up the tickets, which is a nice way of making sure lots of folks of various means can attend.The onsite ticket office and the email address on the website are both great ways of collection this information, particularly when the tickets will be distributed. If you want to make sure you get tickets, show up a bit before the office opens as there will be a queue around the block. I got there 15 minutes before hey opened and it was fine. They also may give you two tickets, so just ask if you have any questions. The staff speak several languages and are very helpful. Regarding the venue itself, I can't say anything that has not already been said. It is spectacular and a huge miss if you are not able to see it. If there are no shows you are interested in seeing, then definitely go on a tour."

We purchased opera tickets for the inaugural season of the Teatro Colon after the completion of the restoration only to be turned away upon arrival due to a musician's strike. The following year we again purchased tickets for a recital by Argentina's leading soprano Victoria Cangemi and she was truly magnificent, but we still yearned to experience a full performance at the theater. Upon our third visit we scored front row seats on the central balcony for a spectacular Swan Lake. It is no wonder that the Colon is considered as the most beautiful theater in the world. The opulence of the theater is surpassed only by the astounding acoustics, you can hear every note of the orchestra and very step of the dancers with unbelievable clarity and intimacy. You are immersed in and become part of the performance, I still get goose bumps! Incredibly the best seats in the house were AR $300.00 per person .. we thought it was an error until we got our Amex bill, $67.00 including the international processing fee. Argentineans are passionate about the Colon, and it showed in the elegantly dressed crowd and impeccable theater etiquette, no one used a device or attempted to eat or talk during the entire performance. We were so impressed that we returned the following day for the excellent tour. The guided tour is AR $180.00 per person which in comparison to the ballet tickets is an astounding sum, so consider purchasing tickets online before leaving home on the theater's website for a performance and experience the full impact of the Teatro Colon!"

First of all, forget about e-mail, it will not be answered. I would recommend checking the schedule of performances online and making a purchase depending on the current availability of tickets in person, at the the ticket office using pesos, mostly because of the difference in the real value of Argentinian peso (blue course) vs. the credit card exchange rate, which is based on the official exchange rate. If you are not concerned about loosing roughly 25% of the money, you can purchase tickets online.We wanted to combine the tours of the theater (the tours are offered throughout the day) with the performance, but this is not possible since the last tour is given at 5:00PM and the performances start around 7:30 or 8:00 PM.The theater is huge. The performing level is extraordinary, this is a great orchestra. The acoustics is incredible and you can hear the performers perfectly well from any level of the theater. However, beware that if you buy an inexpensive ticket, you will not be allowed to see a foyer of the theater. In fact, there are different entrances depending on your ticket and you will only be allowed at the level where you seat is located. Also, you cannot walk freely and see the entire theater or to change your seat during the intermission. The least expensive tickets also offer only a partial view of the stage."

I\u2019ve been looking forward to attending some performances at Teatro Col\u00f3n, one of the world's most famous opera houses. I'll miss prime ballet, opera, and symphony but got tickets for two drastically different off-season performances.Breve Sue\u00f1oBreve Sue\u00f1o (Short Dream) was performed for a small audience in Theater Col\u00f3n's basement studio. It\u2019s one of several \"new work\" performances commissioned by the Center for Experimentation Teatro Col\u00f3n (CETC).The performance, Short Sleep, is described as a \"diptych made up of the work - Beyond - by composer Patricia Mart\u00ednez in collaboration with choreographer M\u00e9lanie Alfie\". The avant-garde piece was primarily modern dance with some theater, singing, and percussion accompaniment. The interesting production is difficult to describe but I enjoyed it. Many in the small crowd of about 200 were friends of the talented young performers.Mozarteum ArgentinoMozarteum Argentino, a private, non-profit musical institution in Argentina, organizes special performances at Teatro Col\u00f3n and provides scholarships to some of Argentina's most able musicians. The performing artists for this production, the German ATOS Trio, were magnificent!ATOS Trio has only been playing together for a few years, but they have won many awards. The popular group played at Carnegie Hall in 2010. This is their second appearance at Teatro Col\u00f3n. Last night they played trios from Haydn, Mendelssohn, and Dvorak. The group consists of Annette von Hehn - violin, Stefan Heinemeyer - cello, and Thomas Hoppe - piano.Teatro Col\u00f3n HistoryTeatro Col\u00f3n opened May 25, 1908 with a performance of Verdi\u2019s Aida. The theater became one of the world\u2019s premiere opera centers. Over the years Teatro Col\u00f3n hosted many notable composers, performers, and conductors, including Italian Arturo Toscanini, French opera singer Jane Bathori, Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, Greek soprano Maria Callas, legendary Luciano Pavarotti, and Argentine Tango bandoneon maestro Astor Piazzolla.Beginning in 2005 the Col\u00f3n went through four years of renovations. The theater reopened on May 25, 2010, the 200th anniversary of Argentina's May Revolution and the country's split from the Spanish to become independent.The renovated Col\u00f3n was to reopen two years earlier on May 25th, 2008, the 100th anniversary of the first opening of the theater. Renovations took twice as long as expected and cost four times more than originally budgeted.Teatro Col\u00f3n's history is dramatic. The opera house\u2019s original opening date in 1908 was almost twenty years after the first cornerstone was laid in 1889. A series of tragedies complicated and delayed the originally scheduled 1892 opening.The director of the project, Italian architect Francesco Tamburini, died soon after construction began. His friend and fellow architect, Vittorio Meano, took over the project. Shortly afterwards Meano died - murdered in a love triangle quarrel. Then, a third Italian architect, Angelo Ferrari, took on the project but soon after was assassinated and followed the other two to the grave!After the three dramatic deaths, a Belgian architect, Julio Dormal, took over and finished the project. Dormal also managed construction of several other grand Buenos Aires buildings, including the Confiteria Richmond Caf\u00e9 on Florida Street.Perfect acoustics are one of Teatro Col\u00f3n's main attractions. The sound \u201creaches every audience member perfectly \u2013 no matter where you are sitting\u201d. The beautiful ceiling frescoes surrounding the stage are not the originals which were damaged by moisture in the 1930s. Argentine Muralist Ra\u00fal Soldi repainted the original frescoes in 1966. Soldi's work is also found on the ceiling of the Galerias Pacifico shopping center.The concerts at Teatro Col\u00f3n will remain fond memories of this time in Buenos Aires. It will be exciting to be here for the 2015 D\u00eda de la Revoluci\u00f3n de Mayo celebration. This national holiday in Argentina is always celebrated on May 25th, regardless of the day of the week. It honors the First Independent Government in Buenos Aires formed on May 25, 1810 after a small revolution took place.\"The May Revolution wasn't so much a revolution but more a series of political and social events in Buenos Aires. During the early part of the nineteenth century those events led to the first local government not designated by the Spanish Crown in the region known as the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, which contained the present-day nations of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay.\""

Considering we had paid just 5 pesos for the wonderful sailing ship museum at Puerto Madero and 20 pesos at the fascinating Museo Nationale de Arte the day before, we were annoyed about the unreasonably high cost of this very short tour. It is something to see if you haven't been to places like Versailles etc - very ornate & opulent in a traditional French/Italian style, with grand Italian marble staircases, sculptures etc; however, other museums, palaces and theatres in Europe, Asia, Russia etc are often bigger and short tours like this are usually cheaper. Here they offered no more than some facts and brief descriptions - our tour was less than 40 minutes! Our suggestion would be to go to one of the free public performances that our guide told us about - we were amazed & annoyed when we heard that was an alternative to this tour! Apparently they're held quite regularly on a Sunday. We would have preferred to pay a bit more and see a performance if we had realised how poor this tour was. Our guide talked about the outstanding acoustics so why couldn't she switch on a simple, sound system so we could hear some classical music for at least a few minutes? As a retired teacher I hope they do that for their school students or I would expect the children to be even more bored than we were! So many museums, especially those charging high entry fees, provide an interesting video - maybe something for just 5 minutes? So expect a pleasant young woman leading this tour, mostly facts, a quick look around - 5 or so minutes \"sitting in the best seats\" with a view of the stage. No behind the scenes tour like at the Sydney Opera House. We would not recommend this tour until they give customers, especially tourists who they charge a much higher rate, better value for money."

We bought the tickets (180 pesos per person) in advance to avoid standing in line when we got there. (We didn't see any lines when we went for our tour). The building is simply magnificent from the outside and incredible from the inside. So grand and classy! We did the English tour at 10 am. We had a sweet, soft spoken guide and we enjoyed gaping at all the marvelous decor and embellishments. The auditorium is just splendid! It is huge and we could just feel the excitement of watching a concert or opera even though it was empty. This is definitely a must see when in Buenos Aires. If you can't get to watch an opera or concert, at least do the tour!"

There are tickets available starting at 100 pesos ( standing) which is a real good value compare to the cost of a tour ( $20 US) The building is beautiful both on the outside and the inside and the accoustic is renowed to be among the 5 best in the world . It is also safe and easy to access as there are metro stations close by ( we took Tribunales which exit is less than 100 meters away) and the Teatro on on the main Boulevard of Buenos Aires . The only irritant was that we never found the way to buy the tickets on line so we had to go and buy them at the ticket counter . Another odd thing is that the main entrance is at the back of the building . Taxis were readily available at the end of the representation at 22.00hrs !"

We walked right to the ticket counter and were able to buy tickets (about USD 20/pp) for the next English-speaking tour which left in about five minutes. The tours do really run every 15 minutes, making it very easy to catch a tour.We enjoyed a lovely, informative tour that lasted about 45 minutes. The architecture and finishes in this building are absolutely amazing and must be seen. While not an opera fanatic, just learning the history of this building and the performances held in it was fascinating. While a bit expensive, we would highly recommend doing this tour while in Buenos Aires!"

The building is amazing. It was intended by the elite of Buenos Aires of the time (1908) to mimic the world famous and opulent opera house in Paris, I have not been to the one in Paris but I have been to Versailles, which is not much more opulent. Pavarotti claimed that the acoustics were too perfect, revealing too easily every mistake. Listen closely to the guide, and you will catch a glimpse into Argentinian elite society of 1908, which was desperate to downplay any notion that they lived in a backwater of civilization and insisted that their elitist biases and pretensions were every bit as legitimate as any in Europe."

We were guided through the entryway, the waiting rooms and the center balcony. We were also able to hear about 10 minutes of the current symphony as they practiced for their upcoming show. That experience was outstanding. My son loved it. And everyone was wowed. The tour was full of historical information about how the theater came to be, how it was created, fell into disrepair and subsequently restored, who sat where and why and a number of details I have forgotten. It was very entertaining. It was long for us to wait, but ultimately we were only there about 3 hrs total. My son managed to take a nap while we waited in line. It was sweltering though, so if you're there in the summer don't expect a cool air-conditioned wait. The theater itself wasn't too hot though. Overall, excellent experience save the heat. Recommended, especially if you can hear a rehearsal of some sort while you're there."

One is a strong word of caution about the online ticketing: You can't buy a ticket online in advance and present your e-ticket in person via your phone. After navigating a clunky website, I arrived at the theater and presented them with the ticket on my iPhone and was told it wasn't valid, even though I had a receipt and bar code right there, which they could theoretically scan or even print out for me if they wanted. So I had to wait in line and buy a new ticket for another $18 US.That said, the level of the tour is quite good. You learn a lot about the recent renovation and see most of the public areas. You don't see any of the backstage operations, which would have been interesting. And a few of the recent controversies around productions at the theater were glossed over (the Katharina Wagner episode in particular). But the guide was helpful and spoke very good English. Bottom line: Definitely do the tour but arrive early to buy a ticket in person."

Shocked, they queried its nature. He replied that the acoustics were so perfect that were he to make a mistake...that everyone would hear it! I am an amateur singer, in the Capitol Hill Chorale, so when it came my time in the Spanish tour to take a picture of the immense stage and seating, I burst forth with the Beethoven's Ninth's \" Freude schoener Goetterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium\" from the rear box, front row(much to the irritation of the tour guide - hey, there were stage jockeys setting up loud metal thingies at the time).

My wife regularly attends our local opera, so she was not about to miss an opportunity to see an opera at the world famous Teatro Colon (despite the fact that she hates the opera that was playing during our visit: Madama Butterfly). I don't attend as frequently as she does, but one thing I've noticed when I do attend our local is that, when the soprano hits her high notes, it can sound somewhat shrill, or even piercing. That was not at all the case at the Teatro Colon; the acoustics are fabulous. The theatre is designed in such a way that sound is easily heard from anywhere, but at the same time, there are so many draperies in and around the boxes that the sound is dampened and doesn't bounce and echo around the hall. This really improves the sound quality - even if you don't care for the story being told. If you're an opera fan, the Teatro Colon is a must. If opera's not your thing, do what I do: just enjoy the music and try to remember which Looney Tunes cartoon featured it. If neither of those options suit you, or if there isn't an opera when you visit, you can still take a tour. Both the inside and the outside are impressive and worth a look."

It was built to impress, and that it does, with marble from Italy, Portugal and Belgium.

It's architecture is considered a fine example of Eclecticism. The hall seats over 2500 people with standing room for another 1000. It took almost twenty years to build, finally opening in 1908. A recent renovation took place over a period of four years, with the theatre finally reopening in 2010. It is located on the beautiful 9th of July avenue and is one of the jewels of Buenos Aires one should not miss when touring this fine city."

I thought the interior was much prettier/opulent and certainly the guided tour was much more informative and easier to understand. The tours werent packed in like sardines at the Colon. Check the schedule o see when our particular language you is offered. Tour entrance/ticket purchase is on the left side of the building, not the front. Get there a little early as th ours can fill up. As far as seeing a performance, check the schedule in advance of our arrival. Many months there are no performances."

Since tours are offered on the hour, but a tour in every language is NOT offered every hour, it might be worth calling or emailing before you visit to confirm when your language tour is available. And then make sure you show up well ahead of that time (an hour? maybe ask that too) to buy your ticket, because these tours sell out. There's a cafe that you can kill time in while you wait for your tour. And the tour is worth the effort - it's quite well done, and you learn things about the theater that you wouldn't ever know if you just attended a show. But I hope to attend a show here someday too! It's a beautiful theater - very reminiscent of La Scala in Milan."

I would have to say that it's the prettiest building I got to see while in BA...on a purely visual scale though, if you've seen the Paris / Vienna opera houses you may be a little less \"wowed\" by the BA one. We did get a chance to sit in on the musicians practicing and the acoustics were amazing. So, if you can book tickets to see a performance there, definitely do that. Overall, not a bad attraction to see while in BA but if you have seen other opera houses in Europe you may feel a little less impressed."

Guided tours are in different languages; I chose the English tour (first tour of the day). Our group is small, 5 visitors and our guide is Alejandro who started the tour by explaining the history of the Teatro. We learned that it was a Train Station before it became a theater. Shows at the Teatro include operas and other types of musical presentations. Famous singers and actors had sang and acted at this Teatro.He showed us the various rooms of the theater, explaining the uses of these rooms and the renovations that had been done. Allowing us to take as many pictures (no flash) as we wanted, he waited for us before proceeding to the other rooms. Areas inside these rooms are beautiful, particularly the ceilings. They reminded me of some palaces that I had visited in Europe. (See attached pictures)Lastly, he showed us the theater itself, pointing out some Boxes or Reserved Areas of the theater (reserved for city officials and politicians). He allowed us to briefly sit down at these reserved seats. Construction workers where busy doing something at the Center Stage so we did not visit this section. I truly enjoyed my visit of the Teatro. I wished I had more time to experience watching an opera or a play. Be sure to visit it!"

The acoustics, the sets, costumes and ballet were beautiful. It is well worth trying to reserve seats online prior to arriving in BA. The website is difficult to navigate; I had assistance from a Spanish speaker, and it was still difficult to navigate.

I've read that a guided tour was worth it so I gave it a try... it was well worth it! The guide was spirited and very nice, she did a great job at keeping everyone interested in this theater's amazing history: how it had 3 architects and what happened to each of them, their influence in the theater's architecture, the material that was used, etc. It was a very nice guided tour and well spent afternoon, I would visit again in a future stay at BA."

I imagine that it must be spectacular to see and hear the theatre come to life. Ticket prices are reasonable from what we could tell and there are even some free concerts on certain Sundays. Enquire directly at the theatre. The tour cost 150 ARS."

Each tour can accommodate 35 people and it departs every 15 minutes. You can take the English or Spanish tour. Our tour guide was excellent and you can tell she was also passionate about live musical performances."

The tour ticket seller was rude; the cafe, closed; the gift shop, extremely sparsely supplied. Several of us were determined to support the organization by shopping at their store, but there was almost nothing to purchase! And some miscellaneous musing: Why does a country with such rich indigenous cultural and so many natural resources need to bring everything from Europe for its building to matter? Are perfect acoustics only available with imported materials?"

The acoustics are incredible and even though we were up high in the rafters we heard every instrument, every dancer's footfall, and every choir voice.

To see the space on a guided tour is an experience in itself just because of the magnificence and history of the building. Unfortunately for me, there was no concert on the day of my visit. There are tours in English but I'm not sure if they are given every hour. The day I went, I got there at 1:00 pm and had to wait for the 3:00 pm English tour. I did not have to make a reservation in advance, just get in line and buy the ticket. There is a nice cafe at the Teatro where I chose to spend the time as it was, after all, a rainy day. However, this cafe does not accept credit cards so have cash available. The tour only lasts 50 minutes, which I feel is hardly enough to really appreciate the place. I do believe that to really experience this place it is necessary to attend an opera or a concert. Definitely a must see!"

This is where my husband gave his first solo guitar concert some forty five years ago and although the theatre has been updated and refurbished since then, it still has a romantic bygone atmosphere."

But, unless you go thru with a tour guide that can tell you about what you are seeing, you'll miss the important and interesting parts of the building and you probably won't leave satisfied. It's not the Palais Garnier in Paris, but I am glad I did a tour.While we were there, the symphony was rehearsing for Madame Butterfly. So, it was very nice to sit for a few minutes and hear the notes fill the theatre as it would during a performance."

As a classically trained musician, when I heard that Teatro Colon was ranked as the opera house with the 3rd best acoustics in the world, I decided I'd rather see a concert than go on a tour. When I went to the box office, I was amazed to find that they were selling tickets for that night's performance for the same price as the tickets for the tour. I am so grateful I chose to see the symphony rather than just go on a tour, because it absolutely blew my mind. What a beautiful theater! I dragged two of my non-musician friends from the hostel along with me, and they also absolutely loved it. I would recommend seeing a concert or opera at Teatro Colon to anyone, regardless of their musical experience."

I wish I could have stayed longer in Buenos Aires to attend an opera there.I must warn you though, the chairs are very hard and not very comfortable! We were in the orchestra seats on the very first floor for a classical symphony performance, and though the entire musical performance was only 2 hours at most including an intermission, I ended up with a very sore rear end and a sore back on my weak back. I am not sure how I would have fared on a 4 hour opera performance.

However, a Theater like this is a place you must see working: check for the amazing shows they usually have. I decided to visit the Theater at last minute, i got the cheaper and expectedly worst location (Cazuela). However, the acoustic of the Theater made the experience valuable, and the view of the stage was perfect. Even if you don't find a great location, do not miss a show. It's the most amazing experience in Buenos Aires."

You can't (seem to) book in advance on the web site and need to turn up in person. A top tip is to consider aiming to arrive just before 12:00.

Our tour guide was able to tell us much about the history of the building and some of the reasons it is so special. She also told us some great stories of personalities who have performed or been involved with the theatre.On the day we visited they were setting up the lighting for the ballet. This takes approximately two days for each new performance. Although it was dark and we were disappointed that we weren't able to see the main hall and the dome, which are obviously two of the special features of the theatre it was interesting to watch this happening.We saw some of the costumes which are all made in a workshop on site along with the sets, and upholstery.We would love to go to a performance now."

Then there's the phenomenal auditorium which is a sight to behold and rivals the most exquisite Opera Houses in the world in its opulence and beauty.

Am certain I will never get as close to the stage as we sat during the tour. I could close my eyes and almost hear Luciano's voluptuous voice caressing every note.

As opera addicts we had to spend an evening in the beautiful Teatro Col\u00f3n, in the first half of the 20th century one of the most important stages of the world. We thought it could have lost some of its brilliance, but the performance of Verdis \"Falstaff\" was a joy in every field - great singers throughout, the orchestra in good shape and very dynamic, a rather traditional, but convincing stage. And the building itself is already worth a visit!Good cheap tickets with almost full visibility were 360 AR$ (about 40 US$ with the official changing rate sep 2014), the best tickets around 1800 AR$ (225 US$)."

We arrived at the opera house with about 20 minutes to spare before the English walking tour, and were able to have a quick cafe y medialuna in the small cafe in the lobby while the rest of the group gathered. Make sure you have a map or good directions to the theater, as we arrived when a practice was about to begin and almost went in with musicians before we were stopped by security- it would have been cool, but would have missed the tour!Unlike some of the other English-speaking tours we did in BA, our tour guide's English was excellent and his stories were interesting. We got to sit in the theater for a bit while a group practiced, to truly experience the acoustics of the facility, and see a lot else besides. Probably not a tour to take uninterested children or bored non-music/non-history types, but I thought it was great."

Learning the Parisien aspirations of the Argentinians, the Golden HAll, and the various stories from a well informed guide. We also went to see if we could give free tickets for a Sunday concert, a little birdie told us there were free concerts on a Sunday at 11AM, but alas we were not so fortunate. It was resuming the week after we had left.HAd a snack at the CAfeteria and had a Rogel del Dulce de Leche, a signature dessert of the Argentines..soooo sweet though."

There was a notice saying that the theatre was getting ready for a ballet the following evening and testing the lights so it may be dark in the main theatre. I thought that would be ok & I had other plans for my last couple of days in BA. The tour guide was good and she spoke English very well and gave us opportunities to take photos and ask questions. When we came to the main theatre it was disappointing that it was very dark (could only just make out the dome at the top). To ask full price (ARG$150) for a tour when you couldn't see the detail was a bit disappointing. If you see a notice saying the lighting might be down & have time to come back another day do. I would've loved to go to the theatre but didn't bring any formal wear with me on my trip so couldn't go. Never mind. I must remind myself to pack something posh next time I go on a trip just in case I get tickets for something. I am saying this tour was very good and not average because I know it would've been if we had gotten to see the auditorium."

Also the tour was very \"music\" focused--which I get it's a opera house, but we were more interested in the architecture and that was more glossed over. Also, I don't think that students rehearsing in the hall should limit access for those on paid tours. I can understand if a concert or performance is underway, but what looked like middle-school students playing violin should not trump paid guests."

Instead of doing the 150 peso tour of the Theatre, we opted to go and see the Philharmonic Orchestra play for 170 Pesos instead. This gave us both a fantastic view of the theatre and a great muscial experience (we're not huge orchestra fans but it was a great way to experience the theatre)Definitely worth doing if you have time and there is a show on, the cheaper tickets are higher up but the acoustics are so good in this place that it doesn't matter. Don't worry about being under dressed etc.., the cheaper tickets are a mix of everyday people and we are backpackers who unfolded our least wrinkled shirt and enjoyed it all the same. We also popped in the front entrance (the posh/expensive side) before the show for a nosey before being directed to the side door for our seats"

Let me preface this with the fact that I'm from Washington, DC where virtually every museum / monument / park is free and those that you pay for (like the Newseum) gives you your money worth by having a full day or two's worth of content. The price as of July 2014 for the tour is $150 pesos per person (about $15 USD as of Mid-2014, and the student rate does not apply to foreigners. ) The tour itself lasts for about 45-50 minutes, and goes from the foyer, a side room, and the auditorium and that's it. It gives you enough time to take pictures of these areas, and gives you interesting facts about the place, but I didn't think it was worth the price. I had a longer, yet much more interesting tour with the BA free tours which I found more worthwhile. The cheapest seats for a show are only about $5-10USD more than the tour would me much more worthwhile. Nevertheless, it's a gorgeous theater; they should either show more of it or charge less."

The Teatro Colon recently underwent a multi-million dollar restoration by the Argentine Government returning this magnificent, historic building to its former glory. Daily tours are available in several different languages at nominal prices. It is home to the ballet, symphony, and opera in Buenos Aires and sometimes rehearsals are in progress during the tours. There is a small caf\u00e9 in the lower level which is open for refreshments while awaiting the start of your tour. The tours are short but they give an extensive glimpse of the front of house and the auditorium but not back stage. Tickets are also available for live performances depending on the schedule at the time of your visit. The acoustics in the auditorium are rated amongst the top three opera houses in the world and attending a show is very worth while and not too expensive depending on the seats chosen. They have an extensive website with details and booking forms. This theatre is well worth a visit during your stay in Buenos Aires."

Because of prior committments, we were unable to take advantage of the first performance of the season while we were there, and having learned that the acoustics were in the top ranks in the world, that was quite a loss.

I've done the guided tour twice -- each time was different, and I was surprised both times at how much I learned, and how much I enjoyed the tour. Aesthetically, Teatro Col\u00f3n is beautiful. The stories of how it was built and restored are historically interesting and, to me, important to tell and re-tell, so that the tradition of live performance can continue to thrive in the digital age. The performance I saw was excellent (Li Biao percussion group), and the space has undeniably excellent acoustics. Highly recommend."

Going to a performance at the Colon Theatre was at the top of my list before heading to Buenos Aires, so the first day we arrived we went to the ticket office to see what the schedule was. We bought tickets for a symphony performance of a Russian composer on a Thursday evening. Tickets were fairly reasonably priced, US 55 each for a well positioned seat. I've seen better symphony acts, but the overall experience was excellent. The people were nicely dressed, the sound was incredible, and the building was gorgeous. This is a must do!"

Unfortunately, all of that splendour is a little difficult to enjoy when your knees are killing you. We would have given this theatre five stars, if it were not for the rather stingy amount of leg room given to the patrons. We felt really bad about having to leave halfway through the performance, but one of the older people in our company was no longer able to put up with the knee pain brought on by the somewhat cramped seating.So, if you have generally healthy low-maintenance knees, or are quite short, I highly recommend this theatre. You will be able to enjoy this absolutely fabulous attraction to the fullest. Otherwise, your discomfort may overshadow all the other seriously amazing things about this place."

Our guide was great, light hearted very informative and passionate however her pronunciation of English wasn't that good and at times difficult to understand. The tour started in the entrance of the theatre then moved through to where theatre guests have their nibbles. The architecture and story behind the construction of the theatre is quite incredible.

If you do not attend a performance at the Colon, do take the tour of the theater, they are offered daily, every hour, takes about 40 minutes and will cost you approx $10 US. Just show up, buy ticket and wait a few minutes for your tour group to start. Rivals any European opera house in it's beauty. I can see why the Argentines are so proud of their Colon."

The opera house is magnificent, but hearing the history and learning about what we were seeing made the experience so much more meaningful. We had the good fortune to be touring at the time that the cast of the upcoming production was doing their dress rehearsal. Our guide allowed us to stay in the opera box a bit to listen. Fantastic!"

The theatre is beautiful, and the history is very interesting, giving a very interesting insight into the local culture in its early years. The acoustics in the theatre are wonderful, and our tour guide was a singer so he demonstrated this with a lovely aria - not sure if you get this on every tour! The tour is more expensive than museums etc in Buenos Aires, but I thought the tour was value-for-money. I believe that the tours fill up, so it is a good idea to arrive early to be sure of getting a ticket. Several tours a day are in English, but the website did not show this, however they answered my email query very promptly."

They're only 80-90 pesos (less than $10 with blue rate exchange) and afford an incredible view of the theater. Plus, unlike a tour, you can experience the lights dimming and an opera/ballet/show in an historic theater with incredible acoustics. Additionally, it is possible to visit other sections of the theater, regardless of the type of ticket you have and so if you see empty seats from the top balcony (which is a fantastic view anyway) you can go sit in them! Tour is great, I'm sure, but if you're in BA for opera or ballet season and on a budget, a fantastic way to experience Teatro Colon is through the standing room tickets on the top balcony."

It was my first time ever at the Colon - even if I had taken a guided tour of the theatre some twenty years ago (!).The theatre is probably the biggest Opera House in the world (if we make an exception for the Met in NY, which however is a more recent building). But at the Colon size does not come at the expense of beauty and attention to detail! The theatre is beautiful and blessed with a miraculous acoustics.Musically speaking, I was a bit disappointed about the playing of the orchestra in the first half of the concert (Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1), with the strings lacking a bit of weight. But when the orchestra came back for the second half (Richard Strauss \u201cEin Heldenleben\u201d tone poem), they really outdid themselves under the inspired, baton-less direction of maestro Diemecke. That was a triumph! I can\u2019t wait to be in the audience for a fully-staged opera performance."

You get to see the entrance, the auditorium and the \"golden hall\". Unfortunately, we only had 3 people rehearsing while we were in the auditorium. We were told that in 1 hour there would be over 90 musicians practising. So my advice is: when you buy the tickets ask when the next rehearsals are to get a mind-blowing experience (we were told by others).There are free concerts on Sundays. Tickets get be picked up from Friday morning to Saturday afternoon. Teatro Colon is definitely a must-do in BA!"

Completed in 1908 and has recently had a complete make-over restoring it to its former glory. Well organised tours every 15 minutes costing around \u00a310 with English-speaking guides every hour on the hour. We were told that if we saw nothing else in Buenos Aires we should see this and it was excellent advice! We were shown around by one of the singers from the chorus who gave us an aria in the Golden room so that we could appreciate the accoustics, and a rendering of a classical Argentinian folk-song in the auditorium for the same rreason. What a treat!"

I joined the queues to do the mid -afternoon tour of venue. It was a very interesting historical tour and particularly so because of the fact that it had been completely renovated in recent years. Our tour was conducted by a very well-read chorister of the theatre who enthused over the information he gave out.Unfortunately inside the theatre itself the lights were dimmed as a pit orchestral rehearsal was about to get under way. The interior theatre grandeur therefore was not evident, but the surrounding corridors and grand staircases were most revealing.It would be great to attend a performance there, and the ballet season then under way was sold out. A tip for tours is to avoid the mornings as long queues could mean a lengthy wait. Hold over to the afternoon if possible."

We decided to take the Spanish tour (my boyfriend speaks spanish) to save time waiting for the next English one. I must say I really did enjoy the tour and had never seen a theatre quite like it before. Even though I didn't understand much of the tour, just walking around and looking at all the different rooms and decor was pretty amazing. The tour guide was great. Once we got to the main theatre there was even an orchestra practicing for a concert and we got to sit in a balcony and listen.

From the street the massive structure is stunning. Once inside it is humbling with French and Italian influence throughout. Then finally when seated in the belly of the theatre it leaves one in awe. Did not have the opportunity to enjoy a performance here however I know it would be one to remember. Our English speaking tour guide was fun and very informative. The cafe in the basement is quite basic, ok for coffee, tea and a light snack."

Plush,red upholstered seats which seemed wider that usual and a gold crested seat number attached to the seat back. When full, about 3000 people it must be quite atmospheric. The walls were clad in Italian Carara marble and it has taken 18 years to renovate the building to its present state. Unfortunately we were not allowed to see the costume department. Certainly a must if visiting Buenos Aires."

For the more budget conscious traveler it might seem a bit pricey at first to take the tour but it is well worth the price, again if gorgeous old architecture is your thing. On the tour you'll learn all about the history of the building and learn about the incredible acoustics. Let's be honest, I was so busy drinking in the beauty of the building and snapping photos that I didnt really pay attention to the tour guide but taking a tour is the only way they allow you into the building if you are not attending a performance. Tours run pretty regularly throughout the day in both english and spanish so at most you'll have to wait an hour. While I didn't get to experience this first hand I did hear from other travlers that it is well worth attending a performance there and that tickets can be quite inexpensive and run from $8-$10."

Although huge, it is extremely elegant and well-proportioned. It was built a century ago and has been, until the sixties, one of the world's leading opera houses. Now, the building is well-worth visiting, should you be in Buenos Aires as a tourist. It is located in the 9 of July avenue, and can't be missed because of its gigantic size. There are tours every day and all day, at regular intervals. Just go there and buy your tour tickets. Most tours are in Spanish, but some are in English, see http://www.buenostours.com/teatro-colonThe building has been thoroughly and perfectly refurbished, a few years ago, inside and out.Now, the artistic quality of the shows presented there is another matter. While the ballet company performs at a good level, the orchestra and the opera productions standards are, in general, much lower that could be expected and in comparison to London, New York, Milano, Paris or Berlin. Otherwise said, the container is gorgeous and up to world's most high standards, but not the contents. Its glory appears to be relegated to a distant past."

I have loved it since I was a kid.This last year, for the first time, I have purchased two season sets of tickets, one for the Opera (8 shows) and one for the Mozarteum cicle of concerts (10 shows).Each of the Mozarteum concerts was absolutely awesome, amazing, emotionally moving, a feast for the senses.Each of the Operas, with the exception of Otello (one of the best Operas I have ever seen, directed by Jos\u00e9 Cura, an extraordinary production and performance) was a piece of very bad theatre, music and experience. I have left the theatre early in 5 performances, and stayed there till the end for the Marriage of Figaro (which is my favorite Opera and hence I stayed for the music although the rest wasn't great at all). The guided visit is great, and it's held every day of the week in several times, and the systems for selling tickets is outdated for ten years, so people have to stay in very long lines in any situation of performances, all the year long. The remodelation made the theatre a wonderful place to visit, and there are a lot of activities there to know the place and enjoy a lot of activities related to music.All in all, a great theatre, and a treasure for any music lover."

The sumptuously decorated building is certainly worth a visit. Duration of the visit is 50 minutes. Spanish speaking visits are more often than english.

This is one amazing building and a very great tour for US $13.00 (as of several days ago...as the prices are rising every day due to inflation!!.) It is a treasure with many great stories told by the guide (her English was very good and easy for us to understand) The acoustics are considered to be just about the best of any opera house in the world. Well worth the hour tour...and the prices for the seats during the season seemed very reasonable....so if you go during the season consider taking in a performance. The most expensive, best seat in the house is $US 180...which is a steal based on many US opera house tickets!!"

So we decided to take the guided visit to see it inside. The price is not expensive (130 pesos) wich is around 10 USD (with the rate according to the date of this review), and is less than what you can a spend going out a night in BA for a much less impressive experience. This is a must in BA and it is much better for ex than visiting the Pink House inside."

Make sure to ask the guide early if the group can view the main theater from the Presidential suite!! It gives you a different view of the main theater. When we finished around 10:45, the line was wrapped around the entire lobby and it was barely moving. so really, go early!! I did think it was a little expensive since foreigners have to pay like three times as much as the locals, but I ended up really enjoying the history and pretending I was rich and famous walking through the main parlor doors."

Now such a tour costs ten pounds (English Sterling) so it is not cheap, which is a shame as the size of the group is 30 so they get a lot of money from such tours. Perhaps better is to buy a ticket for one of the many shows and take in the atmosphere of a concert. Tickets range from expensive (170 US dollars) down to about 15 US dollars, albeit the cheaper ones are high up in the building. I have been iside the Covent Garden Opera House in London and it is second rate compared to this stunning building - the inside has to be seen to be believed. Plush is not the word.

Lovely old building, with grand decoration and furnishing as one would expect from an opera house.In Jan 2014 it cost A$130 for a guided tour - they have dedicated languages, we were lucky and only had to wait five minutes for an English tour.You get to sit in the main auditorium and are walked around some of the very grand other areas. The guide was knowledgeable and spoke English coherently enough to be understood!Well worth the money, especially if you are lucky enough to get a good exchange rate for your dollars!"

The dancing was marvelous, the set design lovely. But the musicians unfortunately just didn't deliver. It was a little bit of a bummer since the seats were pretty pricey (about $100 US/each). I'd advise seeing the inside of this amazing Center, but don't worry too much about getting great seats because frankly, the sound is only going to be as good as the orchestra up front. Buy cheap seats and enjoy the visuals and then go to one of the many jazz clubs around the city."

We saw Swan Lake on Friday, December 27 during a sold out literally standing room only performance. I've never seen rows of people standing in the back before or people clustered in the entryways - for 3 very long hours! We had fourth floor, 2nd row tickets on the stage right side of the theatre not too far after the curve starts. The seats were perfect to see everything. My only complaint was that despite having only three people between me and the end of the row, I had to cross in front of literally 16 people - most of whom were not happy at all, two of whom refused to stand up in the very tight space - when I had to use the ladies' room during the final intermission. The other end did not have an opening. I understand that it's a historical theatre, but taking out two small portions of a metal railing would more than likely not compromise the integrity of the theatre while making a major improvement for the audience. I found the temperature fine, but others in the row behind me and the standing row behind them were all fanning themselves throughout the performance. Absolutely a beautiful theatre totally worth experiencing."

It is known for its powerful acoustics and looking at the main symphony hall you could guess why it is called as one of the best opera houses in the world. Do not miss out an opportunity to catch a show here and if not able to do that at least make it to watch the place and its grandeur with a guided tour."

One of the members of my party was a senior citizen who needed time to go upstairs and downstairs, as needed several times during the visit. This was not a problem as the guide waited for her to start the explanations and still finished the tour on time: a great service that I truly appreciated. In the past, the tour took guests to the theater workshops underground. This was very interesting but no longer happens.

The amount of information was limited, but interesting. It was one of the better tours we had in BA, but a bit overpriced for less than an hour.

Please excuse the forthcoming dose of snobbism: We have attended operas at the Met, Garnier, SF Opera, Los Angeles Opera, Royal Opera, etc., etc., and can say our experience at Teatro Colon, Un Ballo Masquera (Verdi) was absolutely world class. Perhaps the most beautiful opera house in the world, sublime singing, brilliant orchestra, wonderful acoustics. We will never forget this night! Here was the problem: previous performances were cancelled resulting in a snail paced line at the \"will call\" window with anxious patrons hoping to exchange their unfulfilled tickets for this night's performance. As the clock ticked well dressed Argentine men started to rush the window waiving their tickets angrily at the ticket window staff. Security guards formed a blockade keeping the rapidly growing mob at a distance. Tensions mounted. The anger escalated. Having come all the way from San Francisco I refused to be denied, formed a \"flying wedge\" with my arms, exploited my 6'5\" frame, acted like I owned the place, and forced my way through the crowd to a window (I did not knock down any little old ladies). I begged/demanded/pleaded for our seats, trying to make up words in Spanish for, \"it's my wife's birthday\", which was true. Eventually two tickets were presented and we gleefully snuck through the angry mob, who looked like they did not make the last train out of pre WWII Nazi Germany, to our box seats. All o.k.? NO! When we arrived at box 16 there were two people in our seats, hands firmly gripping the arm rests, knuckles turning white. The young Argentine black suited usher was not able to pry them out of our seats..........the lights were going down........the conductor was tapping his baton. And Presto! We were taken to the \"El Presidente\" box immediately adjacent to the stage. It was the size of a small Manhattan apartment, with two anti-chambers, a private marble bathroom, large mirrors, and a subtle perfume that we decided was the brand Cristina Kirchner last wore to the opera.

It was scathing about politics, politicians, the \u2018disappeared\u2019, middle-class poverty \u2013 and I got all that without understanding much Spanish.The dramaturge was sensational, the orchestra was sublime and wonderfully received. The language was of today...there was an audible gasp when one heroine (there were two) and fallen on hard times, when asked her profession stated her work was vested in her vagina - Oooo!...Ahhhh!The Opera was in a minor key...probably E Flat minor, which required the singers to sing to the key, which meant there was little of singing beauty \u2013 more dissonance than harmony, more power than melody, but left us well satisfied. There was a full crew of voices, two sopranos (one, a metzo) a contralto, two tenors and a bass baritone, who were all vocally outstanding. The chorus, meanwhile made good use of their opportunity and sang with gusto and subtlety - to sing for 3 hours+ without melody and sustain pitch and purity is simply very professional.As with most modern operas, there were no memorable sing-along\u2019 arias, but was none the less valid and satisfying for that.There was a most amusing scene and act changer, whereby a large fly descended and an Ellen Degeneris flgure was back projected talking volubly in Spanish about I don\u2019t know what! Below her, was the sign translator giving a farcical rendition of Ellen\u2019s speech...sometimes stopping and interjecting that the Ellen character was going too fast. While clever, it somehow served to distract from the meatus of the Opera, rather than serve as counterpointAll in all, the experience compares favourably with other opera occasions I have attended and in my humble opinion, Argentina has an Opera ensemble of which the nation can be justifiably proud."

Very much worth your time!"

Four of us had travelled around NE Argentina for 3 weeks and had spent a lot of money on buses, taxis, trains, flights, hotels, food etc. - a lot of money. When we came to the theatre we were met with the dual-pricing sign that informs foreigners they have to pay almost 4 times the admission cost than locals (ARG$30 vs. $110). Then we wandered into the grand entrance hall and, when I raised my camera, I was told by someone in a uniform \"only if on tour.\" We were rather annoyed and left the building. Perhaps it is our loss not to have seen this theatre but considering the enormous amount of money we had spent in the previous 3 weeks it's notable that the theatre was the first occasion when we did spend a single peso from the kitty."

The seats were great, very close to the stage with very clear views. The balcony was a big plus because we don\u2019t have this back home. The opera was an original, local creation, with contemporary setting. The acoustics were amazing, so loud and clear. The opera was in Spanish, which we understood nothing of. Nevertheless, it was still a great experience. I highly recommend attending a performance at the Teatro. Performances of the comparable quality or seating would cost at least twice or three times as much in major opera houses in Europe.

We think someone in the gift shop alerted someone outside.The thief took money from a front trouser pocket as our friend entered the taxi from the street side. The robber disappeared into the park across the street. Not a horrible location. Just be aware."

Immediately upon entering this historic and beautifully restored theater I was transported into a theater experience of epic sensations. It is gilded, sparkling and electric with excitement. The sensation of being in a roomy, red velvet seat awaiting a concert had me breathless. Then the performance when perfect sound surrounded me had me dizzy. It was one of the best theater moments of my life. I wish everyone could feel and hear the beauty that is Teatro Colon."

I am so glad to be able to visit the theater in my trip to Buenos Aires in August 2013. As I am able to understand Spanish, I took the spanish guided tour (it also costs less than an english guided tour) and the tour guide explains very clearly about the history and background of the theater. To my surprise, the theater is a bit smaller than the other opera houses I visited in Europe. Anyhow, I still think one must pay a visit to this historical monument when visiting Buenos Aires."

I checked online and saw that there was a ballet in town the night I was there. I went to the theater and bought a ticket at the box office. Best seats are $500 peso but the prices go down from there. I also took the tour in English which was really interesting! I learned that the acoustics are rated the top 5 in the world!! The tour takes about an hour. You buy your tickets at the ticket office which is on the side street to the right of the theater if you are facing it straight on. Dont get confused if you go to the main entrance and it seems closed. Since the theater is a \"working theater\" there are many times that the tour is limited due to rehersals. They will tell you when buying your ticket. Tickets cost 120 pesos, about $16. The day I went, they were rehersing so you couldnt really see the beautiful decorations of the theater itself. The actual ballet was amazing and they are right about the acoustics!!! If you do go the ballet and need to taxi home, I would suggest walking a few blocks away from the theater to get a taxi since by the time the taxis get by the theater, they are already full. It took about 5 min for me to find a taxi. Be agressive and stand on the side of the street to hail the taxi. The subway is closed by the time the performances are done. The buses are still running though.Enjoy! its beautiful!"

We wanted to have the experience without busting our budget, so we purchased the second cheapest tickets (the cheapest being standing, only) for about $12 USD. Our view was quite obstructed, and we did stand for some of the performance for a better view, plus we moved seats after the first half; but, the acoustics are as good as they say they are. We could hear every note and breathe of the singers, and the music was extraordinary! The slight discomfort of standing for the performance was overshadowed by the perfection of the performance.

If you want to see a performance and tickets are sold out , do not forget to ask in the box office on Pasaje Toscanini , because they sell cheap standing-room tickets on the day of the performance , and sometimes there are special performance for tourists on Sunday morning."

English tours are also available, just ask at the counter when the next one is scheduled. As another reviewer said, it's not at all worth the price if you can't speak Spanish so wait for the English tour if needed. The tour itself talks a bit about the history of the theatre, the recent restoration and you get to see the different areas of the building. Unfortunately, they were running a lighting rehearsal the day we went so the main theatre lights were off, which didn't allow us to really see the inside of the theatre - if you have the time, you might want to ask this in advance and go a different day as it really is the highlight of the tour and we feel like we really missed out. Compared to many of the other sights in BA, this tour is a little expensive, but worth the trip to see this gorgeous building."

In a rare piece of luck, our tour experienced the orchestra in rehearsal so we gained a unique perspective on the theatre's extraordinary qualities for a few precious moments. The knowledge that the theatre is a working atelier of costume design, set construction, and music school furthers the significance of it as the crown jewel of Buenos Aires' many treasures."

In 2010 the newly refurbished Teatro Col\u00f3n re-opened for opera and ballet, restoring this great acoustical hall stage to its rightful place among the best in the world. How could we go to Buenos Aires and not visit?We booked tickets for an opera (Otello, in this year of Verdi) and then decided to book a tour as well. Finding the right place to purchase a ticket is a little bit difficult, since there are no external signs that we could find. The big building takes up a city block: the fa\u00e7ade facing the famous 9 de Julio Avenue is actually the backside and closed to the general public; the front side, located on Libertad. Entrance to the box office and the tour office must be access from Tucuman or Viamonte.The official site indicates that you need to schedule about three hours for the tour: this time is to allow for the wait from the time you get to the ticket counter\u2014there is usual a wait for an hour or two from the purchase to the start of the tour. To assist in the wait, the ticket office will give you a discount coupon for a snack at the caf\u00e9 just across the hallway. The tour itself lasts less than one hour.Our tour guide, who spoke excellent English, started the tour by inviting us to imagine scenes from the movie Titanic, since the theater originally opened in essentially its current form at around the same time as the big ship launched. It seems that at the turn of the century Buenos Aires was enamored of all things European, which accounts for many of the features found inside the theater.The tour focused mostly on the architectural and cultural aspects of the theater rather than its musical history, so we spent much time staring at the glorious stained glass and chandeliers and impressive marble finishings. Once in the theater proper we were told about the politicians who use the front boxes, which face toward the audience rather than the stage, as campaign tools, and about the widow boxes which line both sides of the ground floor. Then, as a special treat and to demonstrate the wonderful acoustics of the stage, our tour guide broke into an opera aria, delighting all of us.And then the tour was over. Note that at no time did we venture backstage or underground (there are two floors beneath the stage) so there is no view of the mechanics behind the stage magic. When asked, the guide indicated that the theater had received a lot of requests for such a tour and they were \u2018studying\u2019 the possibility of adding it. Costs are reasonable and the tour should appeal to history buffs as well as music lovers. Note that the opera we attended (Otello) was EXCELLENT!"

In 2004 the interior was dark and worn and I dare say \"grubby\". Everything is now clean and new. They have left one small square on one walls uncleaned. This is what all the wall looked like in 2004. If I recall the walls were so dark from the burning of candles and tobacco smoke. Thankfully, none of that will happen again. In 2004 we were taken behind the scenes and into the vaults below the theater where we could view the stage props of every kind and a hugh gallery where scene construction was going on . The 2013 tour starts and finishes in the opera house. The 2004 tour was much more interesting. But the current tour is well worth it to see the theater as it was so bright and clean. Make sure you take special note of the restored seats. On the earlier tour were we taken to the boxes, on this tour the theater boxes were not included. They now have a souvenir shop. They also have a snack bar where coffee and something to eat may be purchased while you wait for your tour. If I recall correctly the tour cost 110 Pesos which in March 2013 was just about $22 US. about $20 US as of today. Pesos only are accepted. The tour is about 1 hour in duration.

They walkaround during the show and you have to plain every time not concentrating for the show.Having watched more than 50 ballets in Theatro Municipal do Rio de Janeiro I'm sure Teatro C\u00f3lon is just a marketing thing nowadays. Rio's theater is much more beaultiful, all seats provides you a reasonable view of the stage which C\u00f3lon doesn't.C\u00f3lon is pricey for good seats and very expensive dor [--] seats.It was a deception so that now I'm sure Theatro Municipal do Rio de Janeiro is the most beaultiful of all Americas."

This time I saved some time for the guided tour of the theatre and I must say it is one of the best places you can visit in this wonderful city.The opulence is breathtaking and the tour guide was also great.Next time we'll try to buy tickets for a show."

The building was beautiful and the opera house along with the decor was so impressive. It was about a fifty minute tour, they offer it in english. If you choose to do this, go early to get your tickets~by ten or eleven. We made the mistake of going at 3 pm one day and the tours had long since been sold out for the day. I would recommend seeing a show if you could as I think that it would be even more impressive!"

If you're fluent just turn up and be immersed in the elegance of the place and try the acoustic yourself!Please be aware that unlike other venues the Colon does not accept returns, so unless you're prepared to taut resign yourself to losing your spare ticket. We did that as a friend was unable to attend due to illness."

You can either take the guided your, or buy a ticket for a concert. Either way you will get the whole picture of it.Nothing can be compared to the atmosphere of the scene, the lights, the decor, the music, the sound, the building , everything is enjoyable here.If you are on a budget, I recommend that you book Paraiso or standing tickets, and you will enjoy the music no matter where you seat, this theatre acoustic is perfect.Please be aware that this is a gov, theatre, and workers can go on strike, ccncelling the shows. Check that before going .If you are going to a ballet or opera performance I recommend that you take the lower seats, and central as possible.Timeschedule is mandatory, and once the show begins you are out if late.Si estas de visita o vive en Argentina, debes al menos una vez experimentar el teatro Colon, nuestro mas querido centro de arte. Su acustica perfecta permite que escuches conciertos en cualquier ubicacion del teatro sin perder detalle. La visita guiada te mostrara los talleres del teatro,donde se hacen los vestidos y escenarios. Y puedes tambien comprar un ticket para ver una obra. Si estas con poco dinero, te aconsejo que compres una localidad Paraiso o de pie, donde podras escuchar todo el concierto sin perder detalle. Para opera o ballet aconsejo localidades mas bajas y centrales, pues sino perderas parte del escenario.No dejes de ir.Incluso hay conciertos para ni\u00f1os y actividades gratuitas."

This is one of the best Opera Houses in the world and we could see why. I would highly recommend this tour. If you have time, try the excellent coffee at the coffee shop there."

The building is magnificent. The first time you enter the main entrance and see the grand staircase, it will leave you speechless. And then, entering the main hall is an experience that will take your breath away. The acoustics are spectacular, and while the seats in the top floors of the hall are small, the better seats are often not too expensive and well worth the price. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

The only bathroom is on the second floor, so if you want to visit before your tour, you will be ushered through a velvet rope and past a series of museum guards pointing the way so you don't get lost. Our guide, Virginia, spoke perfect English and peppered her historical and artistic lore with romantic anecdotes. She had a creative way to keep stragglers from lagging that I won't spoil here. Due to the recent renovation, flash photos are only allowed in the main hall, where there are several costumes from Carmen on display. I have visited the concert halls of Amsterdam and Vienna, but was unprepared for the opulence of Theatro Colon. Some Sundays offer free concerts; the acoustics are said to be the among the world's best. The Teatro shop, where your tour ends, offers a range of souvenirs from pens to scarves, including some small books on Argentine subjects like beef or nature in English or Spanish. I had a reasonably-priced empanada in the teatro's cafe while waiting for the rain to diminish."

I was fortunate to have a tour after the renovation. The building is quite magnificent and elegant and considered one of the best in the world. After a tour I can see why. One thing of note that I found very interesting is that the huge chandelier in the auditorium was designed to hold 15 musicians so they could be used in certain musical arrangements that might be required for a certain affect at times. There were tours available in English. I found our guide a young man very personable and interesting. If you are visiting Buenos Aires I would suggest not missing the opportunity to see Teatro Colon."

            "review": "World-class must-see: show & tour are both needed to get the full experience. Of all the buildings in Buenos Aires, Teatro Colon is the only one I would say is truly a world-class must-see. It is a classic, historic opera house on a par with La Scala.Before you arrive in Buenos Aires, visit the website. It's tricky because only a few pages are available in English, and it's not very easy to navigate in general. But you are able to book both tours and shows online. Not all tours and shows are available online; so even if they appear sold out, you will likely have luck at the actual box office. Tours sell out first online, weeks in advance. Shows do not sell out, but the best-value tickets will go fast.I bought my ticket to the opera Carmen online the day after they were released. Already the Friday night performance was almost sold out. There are no e-tickets; so you have to pick up your tickets at the box office. I picked mine up the day before the show and inquired about tours. They were 90 pesos each, which I thought was too expensive for a short tour. Since I was seeing Carmen anyway, I passed on the tour.On Friday, I arrived at the theatre and many lines had already formed. I asked a guard to direct me to the right line, and I wound up outside waiting for a certain door to open. This entrance to the upper floors does not have access to the main lobby or orchestra section; so there was no way to view this area during intermission or after the show as I had hoped. I regret not having taken a separate tour of the theatre.The theatre itself is spectacular, particularly the ceiling and the loges: elegant, opulent, classic. The acoustics are amazing. My seat was a fair distance away, but the sound was crystal clear. One thing to watch out for: most sections have a back row reserved for people willing to stand. Once the lights dim, sometimes these people will try to stand at the front row and impede the views of the people seated. Because the usher left her station during the show, I had to be quite forceful and ask three women to return to their standing areas as they were blocking the view that I had paid a premium for. No one else was prepared to be so confrontational; so my neighbours were grateful.The production of Carmen was above average. Sets and costumes were fabulous. The orchestra was solid. The romantic leads were head and shoulders above the rest of the company. I thought too many of the arias were not staged to optimum effect; why would you not have the soloists at centre stage instead of off to the wings? Because of our angle to the stage, our view was not the best. I would recommend selecting seats facing the stage directly, regardless of distance, for this reason."

            "review": "Beware of Very Expensive Seats with NO VIEW of the Stage. We would like to draw your attention to a serious problem perpetrated by the Teatro Colon's box office. On Wednesday April 17 at 11 AM, we took a nice tour led by an english speaking guide, who urged us to return to see a performance. We bought tickets to Carmen for Friday evening April 19, for $330 US dollars (1,600+ pesos). Our tickets were for the box seat 29. We arrived a couple of minutes after the theater opened at 8 PM to see that there were six chairs in Box 29, and that two people were already seated along the front rail of the box. We were astonished and dismayed to find that there was no way for anyone else in the box to see the stage without standing and hanging over the two seated people. Even standing and leaning over gave a view of only the right side of the stage. We asked the ushers for assistance but were told that there was nowhere else for us to sit. The english speaking usher asked us several times if we hadn't seen the map of the theater, as if that explained our not having a view of the stage. Contrast this to our Dock Street Theater in Charleston SC. We often book seats in Box LL or MM during the Spoleto Festival, and all six people can see the stage well - from the front or second row of a box also on the left side of the theater.After trying to stand and crane over the two people in the front of the box, we gave up and left after the first of the four acts. We argued with the manager that evening, Mr. Nigri, for a refund. After some time and very unpleasant back and forth, he signed our ticket receipt and said to come back to the ticket office the next day. We did return the next day - to ask the english-speaking ticket seller to refund our tickets, which involved more time and negativity. We did receive a refund - after I presented medical evidence of my inability to stand and lean over through a long performance.It seems to us that the theater is perpetrating a very dishonest practice. Who would knowingly pay $330 US for seats without a view of any part of the stage? We believe that the boxes on the sides of the theater must have been designed for two persons since only two can see the stage. In any case, the theater should ensure that patrons understand exactly what they can expect, and ticket prices should make sense relative not only to what you can hear, but also, see."

It is in the heart of Buenos Aires and is a most impressive building from out side. However the inside is much more impressive. Unfortunately there was no performance on the day we visited but still had a look inside the opera House. The building dates from mid 19th century but had its official opening in early 20th century but has undergone an expensive refurbishment recently. It has a horse shoe shaped auditorium is reminiscent of many European opera houses and can seat over 2500 people. The marble staircase and the opulent inside and the fantastic ceiling give a feeling of grandness. The acoustic is said to be excellent and in the top 5 opera houses of the world. Pity we could not hear or see a live performance. A must visit."

In the tour we found out that there are free shows in the mornings at 11AM, so if you are in town get to the theatre's box office and find out when the next free performance is, and try to get tix for it.

We could have made our own reservations, but had a guide for the day - that was double what we needed. The guide at the theatre was the best!"

The tour cost $100 pesos per person and we both thought it was money well spent. The restoration of the building, the interesting artifacts - costumes, courting bench, furniture, the gilding, flooring all made for a glimpse into the European influence in Buenos Aires culture. We really enjoyed the tour guide's fascinating facts about the president's box ( more to be seen than see the show), the widows' area and the expensive seats. Our guide sang for us and It gave me chills. If you are a singer, you might want to volunteer to have this experience and sing in this room. The flooring moves and if you cross the street you can see a picture of a ball that was held in the theatre. If you visit in March, you may be able to see a performance and really experience the theatre's atmosphere and acoustics."

One was a concert of Russian composers performed by the local philharmonic, which was lovely. The decor, boxes, balconies, ceiling, chandelier and public areas are beautiful and take you back a hundred years They even have \"widows' boxes\" , screened from public view, so widows could go out, but discreetly. They are unused nowadays, but add to the atmosphere. We sat in the platea, on the ground floor, towards the back, but had a great view. The second outing was to a trilogy of ballets, which were performed well enough, but generally uninspiring pieces. I didn't think they were worth performing. However, as we had a private box and dressed up for the occasion, it was worth it just for the experience. Boxes seat 6 people and the first to arrive gets the best seats. Seating is a bit squishy and you can get in each others' way, but we loved it. You can get a top seat for about US$80 which is great value, considering I paid $150 in Vienna for C reserve seats last year. It can be hard to buy a seat, as they only open the bookings a few days before each performance, but it's worth persevering. You can also take a guided tour during the day, which is worth the effort."

She clearly loves the building but also burst in to song for us on two different occasion and her lovely operatic voice only added to the delightful tour. We decided we will definitely plan our next trip to include a performance at this wonderful building, the acoustics are amazing! But if that doesn't fit your plans, I think you will find the $110 pesos money well spent for a tour."

If you go to a performance, remember you are not in your living room and your telescopic camera is intrusive to others trying to enjoy the performance. For God's sake, do not bring small children because the acoustic of the theatre will project their noises."

The tours are interesting (somewhat expensive for foreigners @ $22 US) and give you a view of how society was in earlier times. Before you take the tour, it is worthwhile to go to the park across the street from the opera house to see some pictures of its history, construction and performers. Two tips.. Because of the acoustics of some of the large empty spaces, it is hard to hear the guides, so stand close to the guide. Also, because of the narrow spans of some of the areas, bring a camera with as wide an angle lens as you have. You can take pictures inside, but with no flash use in the interior areas. I was a bit disappointed that we did not see any of the spaces below the opera house. I had the impression that these areas were part of the tours. Some of these areas are shown in the pictures in the park across the street."

It's a fascinating inside into one of the world's best houses.I also attended a unique occasion when the Wagner's Ring Cycle all four operas were performed in one day, whether this will be repeated in other theatres is still unknown but it was an experience. Wagner purists may have other views but I thoroughly enjoyed it.There are standing tickets for all performances at less than US $ 5.00 so anybody can enjoy the experience, if you feel flush there are also tickets at over US$300 for top seats.Colon is a must for anybody visiting this town, the new plaza called Vatican has just been opened, it features a gigantic LED screen that is used for some popular performances."

The tour guide was very informative, providing a comprehensive history of the opera house from the original building in the 1870s to the present time. The current opera house took 20 years and three architects to complete, and underwent a major renovation from 2005-2010.

Dancing, orchestra, costumes all excellent, and the sets were beautiful and very well executed. Our seats, which granted were not expensive at $70 each, were a big disappointment. We bought them live at the box office that afternoon, after reviewing the floor plan with the ticket agent, which showed them to be perhaps 30% off from the center point of the seating. In fact, the seating was a very deep horseshoe shape, and rather than being at off center at the far end we were more than half way to the stage, and had a sideways obstructed view, from quite a height since we were on the 4th floor. We moved into a nearby box so we could at least be at the front and hang our heads over to see more of the stage which made a big difference. An usher initially asked us to move back to our seats at the intermission, but my charming wife convinced her to let us stay which was great."

Also, there are tickets with not so high prices and good view plus adequate acoustic at \"Cazuelas\" 1st and 2sd floor, just over the orchestra. My only concern is that for any place in the floor levels, including the expensive ones such \"Palcos Laterales and centrales\" there are not seat numbered.

Toured the Teatro de Colon and it is gorgeous - just had a $100 million face lift! The magic of the theatre is its accoustics,though, and fortunately for us we were there on a Sunday morning where they give free chamber concerts for an hour. (You must go to box office to get your free tickets, though) It is quite magical when lit for a peformance and the accousics were phenomenal - even though mostly the concert was high school kids."

I payed 20 Pesos - around 5 USD for the entrance to the section \"Paraiso\". Of course the ticketprice depends on the piece they show and this is far away from stage, but if it is a concert it does not matter. In my case of a contemporary music concert, there have been many spare seats in the mainhall so we have been upgradet without a fee. \u00a1perfect!

The French and Italian influences is its design are so amazing. It's always a wonder to image how they accomplished such great construction. The tour, while relatively short, highlights the entry area and a view into the theater. There was a lot to take in about the construction, the import of the different materials, the history of the social influences, and even a hint of a curse on the architects. While we were there they were preparing the lighting changes for an upcoming production, so our view of the interior of the theater was briefer than normal, but we were given the chance to appreciate its splendor. The guide was a delight and very much enjoyed her job. The theater is worth seeing."

I will say that Teatro Colon is a nice opera house but nothing special. The price to see the opera house is 110 Pesos and I think that is fair as long as the money goes to scholarship for young artists with no money. If you are special interested in opera then you should go and see Teatro Colon but if you are not then you have a lot of other things to do in Buenos Aires.The guide was very good and she also song a part of an opera."

Here they claim good portion goes to Teatro Colon restoration and maintenance fund.I've been first on a tour in spring 2011, when the theatre just re-opened after few years under renovations. Season did not start yet.On my second visit to BsAs this March, I was lucky there was a concert:From Sorrow To LoveGuest Conductor: Marcello PianniSoloist: : Julian Lloyd Webber, celloKrzysztof Penderecki: Threnodyto the Victims of Hiroshima Edward Elgar: Cello Concerto in E minor, Op. 85Sergei Prokofiev: Suite from Romeo and JulietI did splurge on 2nd row orchestra ticket ( ~USD75) and was in musical heaven for 2 hours!Acoustics is unbelievable in this theatre!I am in BsAs again.It's a pity there is nothing interesting for me running now.

That just isn't fair. So we kept an eye on the programme schedule and today got in for free!! Individuals & companies of Buenos Aires sponsored a concert by Cuarteto Gianneo. This allowed us to spend a very pleasant hour and a half listening to works by Guastavino & Debussy. As an extra bonus there a guest artist - Rodolfo Mederos, who played his bandoneon along with the string quartet. They delivered Five Tango Sensations which more than proved the stunning acoustics that makes Teatro Colon world renowned. While listening to the music we looked around and appreciated the enormous orchestra area and the stunning paintings on the domed ceiling. Our perfect seats were on the 5th level - Tertulia Centro - but after the concert we were also allowed a little wander round at ground floor level. Reckon we beat the system. Got to do our own tour and hear the music all for free. Came home & completed the experience by reading the facts about the building on the Internet"

I do not like at all to write negative reviews but this time I have to admit that I have no alternative.I did the guided tour for some years ago in where I visited the WHOLE building that is, also the underground floors where the costumes, shoes and decoration are made for the concerts.As the Colon theater was closed for restauration for quiet a long time I wanted to see how it looks today. I pay 30 pesos and not the horrific fare of 110 pesos for tourists and other non residents.Let me say right away: for me the Colon Theater is beautiful: it looked like I was somwhere in Italy, France or even an English mansion. But...!This time you will not see the underground floors and you will only hear a few stories and descritptions of the building. A little less than 50 minutes and then you are out!Yes, you will be allowed to take a seat but you are not going to hear any music in spite that the guide will assure you that the acoustic of the place is among the 3 best in the world.For the asking price (for tourists) they could AT LEAST invite some music students to play for a few minutes or even play a cd or something.This is like sitting in the best rollercoaster in the best amusement park in the world and then leaving without riding it.Just not to be that negative: save the money and buy a ticket to a concert.Gosh, Im mad they treat tourists in this way...!Good luck! :-)"

After how many years and how much spent on renovating, aside from the outside looking clean and pretty, the Teatro is still an old lady on the inside. The seats have to be some of the worst we've sat on anywhere in the world. They're narrow and uncomfortably lumpy and hard. Had to tough it out for almost 3 hr performance! Pretty sure these are the original seats. Well, they've added a Spanish subtitle screen over the stage... Not sure what all the hub-bub was about the restoration. Guess it was in such disrepair that $100million still wasn't enough to include fixing up the seats.The guided tour of AR$110 for foreigners is a huge gip, if you compare it to something like the backstage tour of the Met. On the other hand, it's easy to imagine how the likes of Callas and Toscanini graced the stage."

There were scenery shops, costume and milinery shops. Rehearsal halls all on several levels below the performance space. Many of the treasures from the floors below were displayed on the performance level. Most interesting are the costumes worn by famous singers and the furniture of the period.We were fortunate to get tickets in a lovely box in the center of the second balcony. The productions of Sh\u00f6nberg's \"Ervartung\" and Shimanowsky's \"Hagith\" were well staged and well sung. They received positive reviews in the press afterward. Try to schedule a tour on a day when you are not going to a performance. It will be worth your time."

The only negative I have about the tour is that it was too short as there were a few places still closed to the public.There is a seating chart to view prices for productions inside the ticket office and there is also a small cafe across from the ticket office as well."

We recently participated in a guided tour after many years of renovation works of the Teatro Colon.We were very pleasantly surprised about the quality of the works undertaken. Iluminations, painting works, restoring many details, all in: very good quality which is extremely surprising in this city where the world quality is de facto unknown here.The public area in the underpath is well organized. Separate boxes to buy tickets for the Teatro as well as for the guided tours. There is also a coffee shop, though with unfriendly waiters, completely unmotivated to help and serve guests which unfortunately is a common thing in Buenos Aires.The Plaza outside of the building is not completed yet but it looks like they are going to make a good job as well. The lamps installed in the pavement will look nice as long as they work and are maintained, though in Buenos Aires such things - as nice as they look on day one - tend to break, get stolen or simply do not get maintained at all and then it looks horribly tacky. I sincerely hope, this will not happen there.Summing up: Good renovation works of this great Opera House which can be considered as one of the top 10 opera house worldwide architecture-wise next to the Scala, l'Opera in Paris, Wiener Staatsoper, Bolschoj Theatre and the Teatr Narodowy in Warsaw.Absolutely worth a visit to any visitor coming to Buenos Aires. What is a bit annoying is that they have this discriminating two tier ticket price system: local residents pay 30 or 35 Pesos whereas foreigners pay 110 Pesos."

I'd never heard such enthusiastic musicians, and I've been to plenty of concerts in a number of cities in the US. I shared a box seating area with a friendly and helpful Bolivian man and his 10-year-old Argentine son; they were there to see/hear the boy's violin teacher, an orchestra member. And of course the theater is gorgeous.At the start of this year's vacation, I unfortunately missed my flight from New York, so I had to fly to Buenos Aires the next night. I had an opera ticket for that night, so I emailed the box office to see if I could obtain a refund. Then my wallet was stolen, meaning I was unable to present the credit card with which I'd purchased the ticket online. Not only was this not a problem, but a box office employee responded to all of my emails about the mess with a courtesy and promptness that often seems to be lacking in the US these days. I was incredibly impressed, and I obtained a cash refund when I returned from my travels to other parts of Argentina.Bravo, Teatro Col\u00f3n!"

The tour was interesting and I'm glad we did it. I guess the money goes towards preserving the amazing detailing. We would've like to have gone to a show (the opera was performing that evening) to experience the most famous acoustics and ambience in the main hall (as standing tickets up the top levels only cost $40 pesos - the best place for acoustics), however we had been riding bikes all day and were exhausted. The thought of standing for a 3-4hr show did not appeal at that stage. If you are interested in art/architecture & history then the tour is worthwhile."

Even though they charge non-Argentinians a bit more for the tour, it is well worth the money. This place is spectacular. The have tours in English every hour on the hour and our guide was superb. Her excitement and enthusiasm not only for the theater building but for the arts in general was spontaneous. At one point in the tour, she even broke out in part of an aria from Verdi's La Traviotta. What a wonderful surprise. You get to see the highlights of this recent restoration, including inside the President's box, in the State box, the main stairs and the lobby. We happened to be there on a day when they were doing a light check for their next opera, Verdi's Force of Destiny. So we got to see at least one set before anyone else from the publich had. The second thing we did with the theater was to attend the opera, The Force of Destiny, a few days later. We had booked our tickets online through their web site. While part of the site is available in English, when you get to the ordering part it is not. So, while it was challenging, using a Spanish-English web translator, we were able to do it. We chose our seats on line and they have an enhancement so that you can see what the stage looks like from that section. Let's say that did not work well for us. The view from that section on the site is taken from closer to the back of the theater and our seats were on the first row at the beginning of the section next to the boxes on the 4th level. We were a little disappointed in the seats as if you sat back (which you had to do so that you would not block your neighbor's view) you could only see about a third of the stage. Most of the seats on the sides have that problem because the theater is in a horseshoe shape. While that makes for great acoustics, it's not so great for patrons wanting to see. The opera was spectacular, the music, the voices, and the sets made for one of the best theater productions I have ever seen. I just wish that we had sprung for the higher price tickets at the back of the theater. You could actually sit in the nosebleed seats in the back as well and have a better view than we did. So just be careful in ordering your seats and you will have a marvelous time."

The Teatro has been wonderfully restored and is truly breathtaking in it's beauty and detail. Our guide was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable about the building and it's history, as well as how it functioned in different social periods.Unfortunately we could not see the theatre hall illuminated since they were setting the performance lighting for the upcoming ballet 'Carmen'. We were informed of this at the ticketing office however.We returned a week following the tour to see Carmen. It was our first ballet (and perhaps our last), but the acoustics, comfort and quality of the performers were all top rate. We had a real sense of being in another time.I purchased my tickets online and picked them up at the box office before the performance. The Website for the Teatro doesn't provide much information on a performance until just days before tickets go on sale. Sales begin a couple of weeks before the permanent run. With a little bit of Spanish the ticketing process is easy once sales are open. Prices for Carmen ranged from 490 pesos in the platea and lowest balcony to 40 pesos on the highest balcony. Be aware that balcony seating is sold by the box which contains six or more chairs. Chairs assigned first come first served when you arrive for the performance. Finding the correct entrance according to your seating level can be a bit confused, but it all works out in the end."

The Buenos Aires Symphony played their first concert with a world class violinist, Nadia Salerno-Sonnenberg headlining. Since there were few tickets remaining when we finally noticed an event at the teatro, we had to settle for 4th balcony seats. I would not hesitate to recommend just about any seat in the house. The sound and accoustics were first rate. Even with the seasons first concert, the dress was quite casual. If you had come to Buenos Aires without gown or suit/tie, don't be afraid to venture to this venue. For those who need to know about cost, these seats were about $35 US per person. I felt it was a fair price for a great evening of music. NOTE: The tour of the Teatro Calon is $130 pesos---so a ticket to a real event is just a few dollars more. I would encourage anyone interested in the arts' to watch the Buenos Aires Herald for concert dates or peruse the Teatro's website."

Our daughter was a bit uneasy during the parts we had to stand still a lot, but the guide was very understanding (the same cannot be said for his supervisor but you cannot win them all).The theater itself is simply magnificent and it has been restored really well to the finest detail.

As one of the 10 best Opera Houses in the world, just recently renovated it would be a crime not to at least take a tour. Well we decided to see El Corsario on Dec. 28 and it was the final performance before the Theatre went dark for the holidays. Walking into the theatre our jaws dropped at the absolute beauty of the theatre. Our seats rich red velvet with gold filigree legs and arms, configured like chairs, I could imagine the great performances of the past with Evita in the audience. It was such a beautiful theatre with amazing acoustics. We were enchanted by the dancers, a combination of Teatro Colon company and some from the American Ballet Theatre. El Corsario is a very rousing ballet, very challenging for a youthful dancer and they were wonderful. If you are in Buenos Aires and want to have an elegant evening out, this is it. A note about obtaining tickets: The theatre website does provide information in English, but when you go to purchase it is in Spanish. Moreover, I learned that the theatre doesn't release tickets for purchase until at least 2 weeks before the performance. I worried that I couldn't get tickets and they would not be what I wanted. I went for broke, crossed my fingers and hoped I ordered front row,. The orchestra pit is rather large so it was still a very comfortable viewing distance from centre stage. Score! I happily received confirmation of my purchase and took my purchase to the theatre. The box office itself is not accessible from inside the main entrance, I had to go outside and walked to the right to another entrance where the box office was located, across from a small but chic theatre coffee shop. No problems once I gave them the e-confirmation."

The lady that gave us the English tour didnt know squat of English. Plus, she spoke so quietly that no one could hear her. In my guided group, there were about 30 people from all over the world. Many of them felt the same sentiment as I did.It was very frustrating, I really wanted to know it's history, but unfortunately, I walked out the same way as I walked in \"clueless\".

I've never taken a tour of the building so can't comment on the quality of that particular activity, but I have attended many concerts over the years and, as one would expect in Buenos Aires, all performances are of course sans pareil, gathering together splendid national and international artists to offer an unforgettable musical experience. In the past it was necessary to queue up at the box office to buy tickets a few days before a performance. It now seems possible to purchase these online, but the process is long-winded and several sorts of credit cards are not accepted. Credit card details are also stored by the company that manages the booking service. In general, it seems that any seats remaining once subscribers have had 'first dibs' are released via Web sales four days before a performance.If in Buenos Aires for more than a couple of days a concert or opera at the Colon is an absolutely obligatory part of the city experience. Dress code for early evening concerts is elegant but not overly so: a jacket, tie and dress pants for men, and a dress or suit (day wear is fine) or nice skirt / blouse combo for ladies. One does, inevitably, see a lot of silks, satins, and very eye-catching shiny garments being worn by the porte\u00f1as!There seem to be ample toilet facilities on each floor of the theatre, but the 'bar' that serves the seats in the stalls comprises a little corner table that doesn't seem to offer much more than coffee."

The first was on a guided tour in English at a cost of 60 peso. We saw a very limited amount of the theatre and the commentary we heard was nothing you couldn't learn after googling the teatro for 2 minutes. Don't get me wrong, the teatro is SPECTACULAR. And should not be missed for a second but... learn from my mistake. Go and buy the cheapest ticket for a show, I went to the ballet for 10 peso in the standing gallery at the top and got to see as much of the teatro as on the tour. Plus I saw it as it should be experienced, during a show! Hard to compare the two experiences, one was a sheep-herding tourist trap, during the other the colossal and decadent teatro came to life as a living, breathing stage for performance and expression. Note: I think it's a bit cheeky that if you're from Argentina you pay 20 peso for the tour vs the 60 peso price for a tourist."

Pavoritti said that he hated the acoustics because the audience can here every mistake. They have a place to put muscians in the ceiling. There is empty space under the floors for acoustic purposes.

This means, any error, the minimum it could be, it will be always perceived. It was opened, in today's address, on May 25, 1908, and went through the process of restoration from 2006 to 2011. It is regarded as one of five theatres with better acoustics in the world. It is open now for guided tours. These visits are in English or Spanish and cost, for non-Argentinians, $ 60 pesos. If you are really interested in visiting it, my suggestion is first see the schedule of concerts and performances, as some seats in the theatre are cheaper than the price of the tour. The address for the visits and tickets is Tucum\u00e1n, 1171 (Pasaje de Carruajes)."

I liked that we went through different doors and elevators based on seat location, so that there was no massive rush through the same set of doors. Despite being the cheapest, the seats on the top were very comfortable, and the acoustics were amazing!!! I felt as if I was in the front row of the orchestra, I could hear that clearly. And during intermission we were allowed to enter the main entrance and explore the various floors, an informal tour of sorts. Finally, the staff were very friendly and patient despite our lack of spanish. A delightful experience all around."

To be fair, most of the locals that we met were helpful & friendly, if you could somehow bridge the communication gap. Having one of those electronic portable translation gadgets would be a definite help."

We attended the Opera Falstaff in late November.As we booked our tickets online only about 1 week ahead, the only tickets that were available were those in the standing section (a pie) at the very top of the theatre (mixed gender).We enjoyed the view from up above as we could see the stage and also right down into the orchestra pit. We also enjoyed our birds eye view of the locals in their seats down below.If you get tired of standing there is a row of bench seats immediately behind (with no view of the stage).Even though this is standing room only, we would advise to get there a little earlier to get the better positions, right in the centre. We got there just before the start of the opera and so had to stand on one side which meant the stage was partially obscured.The standing section is very cheap - 2 tickets cost us AUD$15.We booked online and were able to pick up the tickets from the Teatro Colon booking office up to 1 hr before the performance. To pick up the tickets I needed to show photo ID and the credit card I used to pay for the booking.Overall, a great night out!"

I'm sure that opera lovers don't miss a visit to the Teatro Col\u00f3n, but, as we are not a great proportion of mass turism, the place is situated only in the 58th place in the ranking. It's a pity. From all the opera theaters I know it is the most beautiful and magnificent. Perhaps ms. Sharon Williams visits this page once more, I would like to send her some precisions. 1) It is \"Cazuela de pie\" y no \"Cazuela de a pie\". \"estar de a pie\" is having no car. \"Cazuela de pie\" are those places at the Cazuela level (first row above the third balconies row) established for being attended on foot. 2) you can go \"de pie\" at three levels: Cazuela: only for women, Tertulia: only for men and Delantera de Para\u00edso, for both sexes.3) the lady is astonished because people are expected to stand up in a claustrophobic tunnel over the seats during one hour and forty minutes.Let me tell you, my dear, that there are Wagner's opera lovers of reduced means who stay there for four of five hours. 4) The opera she saw was not russian, it was, most probably Janacek's Katia Kavanova. Janacek was a Czek. Russian operas are usually longer.5) Of course she could not get any other place in the theater three weeks in advance, sales per internet are open one month in advance and the argentinian public is avid to go to the theater after more than three years of interruption."

Neither experience (purchase or pick-up) was a difficult experience.There seemed to be a few different entrances depending on what kind of ticket you had but having floor seats I entered through the Libertad St. entrance without a problem. The entrance through the Grand Hall is part of the show itself, and suffice it to say that the restoration in my mind was worth the wait. I felt like I was transported back to the 19th Century!

However, just a few days before we were to leave the strike was over. What a treat we would have missed if we had not been able to tour the theater and attend a performance!The TourThe first thing we did the day after we arrived was take the tour of the theater. The carriage passage way is where the tour desk and the box office are located. You will find it runs through the theater and you can access it off Tucum\u00e1n near Libertad. (The address seems to be Tucum\u00e1n 1171) I have taken the following information from a tract I got at the theater.Guided tours in English from March through December 2005Mondays to Sundays 11:00 am, 1:00, 3:00 pmTickets $12 AR pesos. (We do not accept Dollars/Euros)For further information and bookings: Pje. Toscanini 1168-Tucum\u00e1n 1171. On the side of the tract it reads \"The Colon Opera House might alter or cancel the tour schedules.\"There are tours in Spanish too of course. There are quite a few more available during the day if you speak Spanish. The tours seemed to be limited to about 25 people each. We were allowed to take pictures in the lobby of the theater but no where else. I have posted a few that I took. We were treated to a brief solo violinist demonstration one of the side salons of the lobby before we entered the theater. Of course, the theater is fabulous. I won\u2019t try to describe it. It is what you would expect of a national theater that was built when money seemed to be no object. The tour also included the back stage rehearsal areas where we saw the orchestra rehearsing. We also saw several workshops where the costumes and sets are made. We learned that there are 1,200 employees of the Col\u00f3n.The tour includes a lot of stairs and walking\u2014something you should be aware of if that is a problem.The PerformanceWe were able to obtain front row seats for a performance of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic Orchestra. I believe the cost was $90 AR pesos for both tickets. We bought them before we even took the tour. They are available in the box office in the same passage way as the tour. They will show you on the computer screen what seats are available. I believe you can go online and order tickets. It was thrilling to be only three feet away from the stage. We could read the titles on the sheet music on the stands and see every expression on the conductor\u2019s face. Even though we were so close the sound was perfect. In fact, we learned from the tour that there is no bad seat in the house because of the perfect acoustics.The beautiful surroundings, coupled with the beautiful music made that night one that my husband and I will continue to talk about when we remember our trip to Buenos Aires."
