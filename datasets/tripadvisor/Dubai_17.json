More conservative mall with preference to be dressed with knees and shoulders covered and no PDA. Compared to the Mall of Dubai, this is a lot more quiet and nicer to shop."

The bus from Atlantis takes about 30 minutes, otherwise a taxi is 30D.Here you will find an excellent selection of high end stores and almost everything British but tax free. The diamond jewellery stores are an eye opener.In agreement with other reviews, it's a bit like Westfield only so much bigger and better. Shopping for all budgets - eg 30% off at Debenhams.Set your dear husband up with the kids at Ski Dubai, located in the centre, while you shop, shop and shop! Do pick up a map at the entrance - you will need it. Basically there are three floors: G, F and S where the Galleria and some are at the centre.Samsung at the centre of the Galleria is a good meeting point of you are lost, which is likely! There is an excellent range of cafes and restaurants and no filthy food court as is frequently the case in US (Ala Moana Waikiki).The Chanel is impressive with an increased range of goods and colours not normally seen in Australia. However it all comes with a warning: unless you dress the part you may not command attention and it does help if you are wearing a black robe."

Firstly, while the centre was large it was not so large that you felt you needed a GPS unit just to find your way back to where you left your car!Another aspect of the centre that I liked was that there was a supermarket there. Now this may sounds nuts but we had a great time going through and looking at what foods and products fill the homes of \"normal\" Dubai families. One aspect of the centre that my Mum commented on was that there was no casual seating. At shopping centres at home (Australia) there are seats and couches dotted around the shopping centre for when you need a rest but don't want to sit down and have a meal or a drink. These were missing from the centre, nothing major, but we did notice their absence. If I had to choose one mall that I would go back to time and again, it would be the Mall of Emirates - hands down."

As we were told - and experienced our selves, double EU prices with 1.2-1.5 and you have Dubai prices.If you are in the market for gold etc, be sure to bargain, and keep going.

There was 3 in the whole of the mall (for clothes anyway) which I though was quite weird for coming to Dubai, but apart from that, we really enjoyed exploring this mall.The whole catching a taxi thing was easy here as you just qued up and then as the taxis lined up you just get assigned one, very easy and efficient especially if your new to the country."

It has some 600 outlets and also boasts of Ski Dubai (a skiing facility that also has a ski lift, ice sculptures and live penguins), the glass domed Galleria, and a set of fine dining restaurants around a beautiful horse fountain."

I have visited almost all the malls in Dubai and i feel that there is a special connection with MOE and today, I must say I experienced it. I did some shopping for my little one and had two shopping bags. While waiting for the shuttle bus to the Double tree by Hilton, i kept my shopping bags on one of the benches. When the shuttle arrived, i just grabbed my handbag and forgot to carry the shopping bags. I realized this only after reaching my hotel 5 mins later.Immediately called MOE Lost and found and informed them about the bags. They noted the entrance gate number and details about the contents. Within 10 mins, I got a call back from the security room stating that they have found my bags. I can't express how lucky i felt. I was already back in the mall and went straight to the security room near Carrefour. They confirmed my identity and details about the shopping bags and handed them over. I would like to thank the MOE security team, especially Mr. Asim for helping me. I have never felt this lucky in a long time and I am sure this was possible only because of this excellent country and the excellent team working to make life better for everyone who lives in Dubai.I love Dubai. Thanks for reading.Chai"

There wasn't three hours worth of stuff to do in the centre in the interim, so we didn't bother.Also, beware the games arcade up the top level.

We visited mall of emirates as we had been to Dubai Mall many times on this visit and the last visit to Dubai. The mall of emirates feels like local people the shops of course have the high end stores but it also has normal high street bargain stores and a huge food court with fast foods and a supermarket. The people shopping there obviously live and work in Dubai there's definitely less tourists. The mall itself is not as glamorous or in your face as Dubai Mall and because of this you feel less rushed and can walk around at a leisurely pace as it feels more relaxed. There are of course so many shops you need hours to visit them all."

In a single complex the visitor will find a shopping center, the Kempinski Hotel Mall of the Emirates and an indoor ski resort \u2018Ski Dubai\u2019. This is the first indoor ski resort in the Middle East.  MoE has a multiplex with 14 cinemas, a 500-seat capacity Dubai Community Theatre and Arts Centre and one of the largest indoor family entertainment centers in Dubai called \u2018Magic Planet\u2019. Actually, this is my favorite mall in Dubai.  Now, after the reconstruction, a new uber-expensive extension, which includes several new boutiques, restaurants, and the Middle East\u2019s firsts and only IMAX with a laser screen the visitor will have a new consumer experience."

Unless you live/stay in Jumeira, Dubai Marina, Palm Island (or points further south, toward Abu Dhabi), Mall of Emirates is also further away from the old city center (Deira and Bur Dubai).However, one thing that Dubai Mall doesn't have, is that Mall of Emirates has the largest indoor ski slope in the world. For people who are not interested in skiing on a \"fake\" slope, you can still take pictures from outside.Just like Dubai Mall, it can also be reached by Dubai Metro train (Red Line). It is much closer to the station.Shopping-wise, there are also endless choice here. However, beyond shopping and skiing, I find that there are not really that many interesting things to see or do here."

The only downside is that it is very hard to find seats. I particularly enjoy the Victoria's Secret and the Harvey Nics. But they have lots of different stores. The first floor is all mainly designer shops where as the bottom is more your high street shops such as top shop, river island, h and m etc! Definitely worth a visit!"

Well spaced out, very clean and even though it was busy it didn't feel like it as the mall is so spacious. Prices are on a par with UK prices so no great savings to be had. Ski slope inside if you get bored of shopping! if you get a cab back to your hotel, be sure to agree the price beforehand - we were advised by our hotel it should cost around 30AED but our cabbie tried to charge us 70AED. We eventually agreed on 40AED but the cabbie wasn't happy and drove like a lunatic all the way back to the hotel without uttering a single word to us. Only example of poor customer service we experienced on our whole trip."

You have to be careful with the locals they feel privilege so they are rude and do things to show they belong. Luckily the staff made sure we were accommodated even when the locals tried to skip line and felt they should be served first. Overall great trip so much to do, lots of shopping and outside of the locals being a nuisance everyone else was great and hospitable. Don't get me wrong from what I can see their government has them feeling that way. If all immigrants left their country they would be lost. I don't care where you go if you pay your money you deserve first hand service. I did meet some locals who were nice but you can see they feel some type of way. I would go back with the understanding that they are that way, but it didn't interfere with our trip. I was a little perturbed at the airport when the guy allow some locals to skip everyone just because they were locals and had on the outfit that signifies they are locals. Its a game I choose not to play with them. Thank god for the staff..."

Myself and kids went to the Magic kingdom (i think that's what it was called) while the 'ladies' went shopping. Both groups had a very enjoyable time. Brought kids to the Cheesecake factory for a treat... expensive enough but we ask for a table looking out on the ski slopes (just waited 10 mins) so they enjoyed that."

Yes everything is Expensive in Dubai but my kids found they stock things we cant find in Australia so therefore many purchases were made on sport shoes. Also its a great place to have dinner with many food outlets and restaurants. Also easier to get to with Metro and some hotels have a shuttle service to this mall like Atlantis does. Of course there is a ski field in this mall just to to add to more entrainment. Definitely recommend a visit here. You can also pick up many souvenirs from the supermarket there so very handy."

Do's: where comfortable shoes... lots of walking.Take a sweater or warm jacket.. for those who are sensitive to the cold. As the AC is turned up high.Know what you want to see.. the distances between can be agonising long especially with young kids.Do schedule time to observe the fish Aquarium. .. it's breathtaking with the diverse fish and sharks.You can easily spend the whole day here ... so keep a track of time.It gets crazy over thursday night, Friday. .. which is the weekend here.You will need reservations for popular resturants like PF changsha, cheese cake factory etc. Do get to cab lines early to avoid the rush hour when the mall closes.To Avoid 'treasure hunting' for your popular stores... make good use of the info kiosks and electronic kiosks.Lil tip: you can cut through the mall using the souk on the ground floor and the food court on the second floor...Great entertainment for kids at Sega republic,kids zania and reel cinemasEnjoy, be warm and hydrated."

There are lots of luxury brands - enough to make any shopping fanatic faint from ecstasy and for those like myself whose focus is on food - a Carrefour supermarket which is so huge it could take an hour (or more) to get through the whole store! There are lots of restaurants, but I cannot personally recommend any as we didn't eat at any of them. The best thing to do is ask for a menu if there isn't one displayed at the front and check the prices first. Don't try to cover the whole mall in one day - make it easier on yourself and break your visit up into manageable chunks, so you don't end up with sore and angry feet like mine.

Absolutely nothing useful for the average consumer of goods, but it adds a nice flavour to the place. Also, the customers here are more diversified than in the other malls. A lot of tourist mingle together with a lot of niqab dressed people. Sometimes you read that you need to dress modestly. I don\u2019t really know what that means, but people were dressed in shorts and tees and no one cared.It is absolutely unnecessary to visit the mall other than in a purpose of seeing the biggest thing on earth. All shops selling western goods are more expensive than at home. And since almost all the major chains are represented here and no local stores, all prices are equally more expensive. You can find anything though, from consumer luxury goods to cheap non-descript tees.

I totally recommend that you arrive at the mall early, upon opening time, to avoid crowds.The mall is crowded and buzzing in the afternoons. I spent a day wandering around shops, and arrived back at my hotel around 8pm .. totally exhausted from all the walking :)There is also Dubai Aquarium within the mall, if not keen on entering, you might as well just spend some time in front of the huge glass pane, it is free!Make sure to wear comfortable clothing and equally comfortable shoes. There are tons of food places to choose from and if you just need a rest there are seating areas all along the mall to chill without the need to buy anything.A must visit once you're at dubai mall is burj khalifa, the tallest building, the dubai fountains and souk al bahar all just few minutes away."

It essentially offers the same array of stores and shops that Dubai Mall does with what some - as myself - might consider a big advantage: it is not half as frantic as the aforementioned. Maybe because it is not located at walking distance from any other major Dubai attraction as Dubai Mall is. In addition, if you happen to feel like it is getting too hot you can always get your skis on or go see the penguins at Ski Dubai."

Being the a major tourist attraction safety is key and how it was handled was really impressive. The mall is quite impressive. Think of any designer or international brand and name it, you cannot miss it at this mall. Only challenge would be to locate it due to the massive nature of the mall. So if you want legit designers definitely the place to shop.The human traffic is well controlled perhaps due to the fact that it is such a massive mall. And if you are into cars, watch out for them at the driveway as all sorts of cars come into the mall (though not for display but for individuals). The Mall also has a variety of restaurants as well as a hotel just next to it which you can access through the Mall. You can also access the Metro through the Mall too but brace yourself for a walk. What really impressed me were the activities that were within the mall. E.g the waterfall, fountains, aquarium and underwater zoo. These were actually the highlight for me. It was even time saving as I got to see 4 spectacular things all at the same venue as compared to going to 4 different venues."

There are probably more coffee and snack shops than actual restaurants, there is a very good Food Court in the lower levels. The ski slope is the large attraction here but there is also DUCTAC - arts centre, theatre and old library accessible near the round fountain, near the restrooms entrance. I often visit here as alot of women's coffee shop groups meet here but it is always pleasant to visit. There is also a Debenhams (good for sales) and Harvey Nichols for more expensive clothes.

As our hotel was a couple minutes walk away from the mall, we were here quite often! I absolutely love the variety of shops here and I recommend it to anyone! Range of activities to do and also a food court!! In my opinion it was the best mall I visited in the Dubai! So if you're a shopaholic remember to visit The Mall of the Emirates!!"

The only complaint was that we had to wait over an hour to get a taxi to leave. Partially, that was because it might have been close to a Muslim prayer time, and also it was rush hour. Next time, we'll wait for a taxi at one of the two hotels we saw next to the mall and hopefully have a better chance to get one."

I booked Hilton Garden Inn Mall of the Emirates which is situated just 5 minutes on foot from the Mall of the Emirates on purpose. I wanted to visit this shopping mall so bad.I visited the place during Dubai Shopping Festival (taking place between 1st Jan and 1st Feb). Super discounts everywhere!The area is MASSIVE and very beautiful. Do not worry, you will not get lost, there is signage everywhere. The mall has an ENORMOUS Carrefour supermarket (where prices are super cheap!), Ski Dubai (perfect for a fun day out!) and VOX Cinemas at the top floor (for movie fanatics! Star Wars is showing RIGHT NOW!)To really see everything inside the Mall you have to spend a morning and/or afternoon or else you are in too much of a rush. Best is to arrive at opening time ie 10am so that you can start exploring the area before hoards of people start coming.There are sooo many places to eat and drink you will be spoilt for choice! Shopping is available for everybody from bargain hunters to the avid designer fanatics."

This Mall is great and affordable shops for every breed. A Massive Carrefor which is bonus on the ground floor and can stock up on practically anything as they are the Asda/Tesco equivilant. 2 Main food courts at either ends of the Mall. Every fast food name brand you can think of is available - prices like the UK so don't expect anything too cheap. The Mall has Ski Dubai as well as a direct link to the Metro so this makes it a triple bonus especially as we had everything in our reach. Beatifully designed this Mall really is better than Dubai Mall for a good day out. Plenty of dessert shops such as Baskins and Hagaan Das. It has the first 4DX Cinema and the star war film was being shown at AED 250 - a must for star wars fan.IHOP and Cheesecake factory are round the corner from Ski Dubai. For those who want a view of the ski Dubai at room temperature then book a table at the Cheese Cake Factory and enjoy the views!"

There are a number of interactive mall guides to help you find your way around as well.Great range of stores from low to high end brand names. You could easily spend days here and not go outside.

You really need a lot of time to view all the attractions. Plan well in advance and if possible split it across 2 days. From the parking slot to the mall is well planned. We had to go twice in day, one was for Burj Khalifa in the morning and fountain show in the evening. Better to go around lunch time. Have lunch at the mall, visit Burj and later in the evening view the fountain show."

All things considered, it proved only to be a decent place to walk around and people watch. All things considered, anything I could possibly want in the mall is obtainable at home or online for a better price. I was tempted to ski, but was turned off by the large crowds and the price. As mentioned by previous reviewers, it is not the largest mall in Dubai. Overall, the Mall of the Emirates is worth a walk around if you are in the area and want respite from the heat."

There are so many food establishments on the food courts, or other fine dining restaurants inside the mall or out in the Souk. Also, plenty of coffee shops to just relax and enjoy the view.The water fountain show is better at night as one can see the lights and the Burj Khalifa in the background with the tower lights putting on a show of its own. There is a giant bookstore next to Virgin store offering many items not seen in any other bookstores. Clothing items are everywhere and available from low prices to top brand, babies to adults. There is also the Dubai Aquarium lower floor which offers the largest aquarium in the world and an Ice Skating rink if you're into skating. For those aviator want to be or pilot enthusiast there are two simulators, one Airbus 380 Emirates Airlines next to the Apple store lower level and one upstairs next to the Reel Cinema Boeing 737 Simulator. There are maps available at all information desks throughout the mall. And if you look at it you are exercising the entire time as you will walk many kilometers/miles when it is all finished, unless you take the golf cart taxi's around the mall (Really). It may take you days to be able to see all of it but it's worth it and it truly is one of the best malls in the world. Happy Shopping. Enjoy!"

If you are a shopping lover, Mall of the Emirates would be great and could be one of your best choices in Dubai. It means, that is one place which everyone would like to go in Dubai. But be careful because Mall of the Emirates is too large and if you are going to go there especially for shopping you\u2019ll need take some hours to visit it, so I really suggest you use suitable shoes for walking, but don\u2019t worry if you\u2019ll get tired because there are lots of cafes there that you can enjoy your time. Mall of the Emirates has sensible convenient and you can go there with taxi or subway. Please pay attention that if you are looking for fashion with reasonable prices you shouldn\u2019t miss Debenhams department store in the ground floor. Moreover, if you can manage your time I extremely suggest going to Dubai in January for Dubai shopping festival."

At the end of the new addition is the sport store GO which has a decent selection of out door climbing gear and gym equipment. My gripe with the GO, is that they haven\u2019t priced everything, which is frustrating at times,when there is no one to serve you,so GO please get it sorted. Tom & Serge new off shoot Common Ground is located next to the sports store. Borders book store has finally re -opened at MOE, after an absence of over a year, while not as glam as Kinokuniya books in Dubai Mall its a welcome return after an 18 month absence.Abercrombie & Fitch is opening an outpost in the Mall.I doubt there will be shirtless male models by the front entrance though. Dean & Delucas has opened,while the famous global chinese dumpling restaurant Din Tai Fung is choker block, so get a buzzer, be prepared to queue,as the dumplings are to die for,yes they do have usual chinese favourites, yet it defeats the purpose of eating here.

If you have little children you can leave them at Kidzania, which is the greatest concept for kids anywhere in the world and hit the shops. The mall has everything including the huge indoor aquarium which is very impressive. We visited the mall on a public holiday in Dubai this time and it was honestly wall to wall with people. It was quite extraordinary to be in such a thriving atmosphere and overwhelming at the same time which all the lights, noise and levels. If you want to attend the mall when it is quieter, I suggest going first thing in the morning as the locals seem to be late starters. Be aware of local customs and you should wear clothes that do not show your knees or shoulders as a sign of respect. However it is not absolutely necessary and Dubai seems to be alot more relaxed about this than it was 5 years ago or in places like Oman, where dress code is mandatory. If you do visit the mall you can make a day of it due to its size and all options from food to fashion are covered ten times over."

You will also have a full menu option. Gourmet sliders, finger sandwiches, beef tenderloin. All served to you by your private waiter on real china.

Yet, it is well worth a visit . The Mall is expanding and adding more facilities and attractions , now that it is celebrating its 10th anniversary . The visit to Ski Dubai is a fascinating experience, although a tad expensive @ minimum 250 Dhs per person . The designer shops and restaurants are a treat for the eyes and you can find all major global brands represented here . You are also spoilt for choices so far as food is concerned with close to 90 restaurants, cafes and eateries at the MoE . Worth spending half a day at the Mall of Emirates during the visit to Dubai .

I told him I was looking for a winter jacket, he took me to coat section which did not have the coat I was looking for. I showed him on my ipad what type of the coat I need, he was persuading me to buy one of the coats which was quite unlike the one I showed him.

The selection of shops is very impressive and seems endless when you wander around the mall. We were there during Ramadan so all the cafes were closed which made it difficult to shop during the day for hours on end with no place to sit and have a bite to eat or coffee. If you go during Ramadan then my advice is to shop at night as they keep the mall open much later, only trouble is you miss out on some of the other attractions Dubai has on offer in the evenings. As its so hot in July shopping during the day in an air-conditioned mall is preferable rather than being outside."

And it has some unique offering.It has all the big brands, fashion logos, merchandise etc. However, the most exciting feature for me is their mini Ice world. It has Ice sculptors, Real Penguin family, Ice sports and ski slope. Feeding food to little penguins is a lovely experience. They are just adorable. Then you have Zorbing, tube skiing and few small ice sports. However, the main battleship is ski slope. How they maintain such a big slope is something really commendable. The instructors are very hospitable and teach efficiently. Ohh, they have a food outlet across the hill as well, it gives you a complete feeling.All and all, I love my experience at Mall of Emirates. It should be in must-see list for any visitors of Dubai.Cheers!!"

Mall of the Emirates is smaller than Dubai Mall so personally I prefer it - you can find your way around more easily and it has all the good chain shops - clothes and house stuff, as well as a very large Carrefour.This, however, is not a review for a local living in Dubai, but for travellers thinking of visiting therefore I would say, if you want the \"Dubai Shopping Experience\" you really need to go to Dubai Mall! Mall of the Emirates, while nice, lacks the impressively large, so massive you get lost in it \"appear\" of the bigger, shinier Dubai Mall. It also lacks the huge selection of restaurants - while there are some nice ones in this Mall, there are far fewer.The other issue lies with the taxi rank which has recently been changed meaning you sometimes (particularly during shift change which I think happens around 4pm) end up waiting for ages as they don't come through so frequently and don't drop off in the same place they pick up from.It has a cinema, restaurants, lots of shops, and is lovely and clean and cool inside ... but none of the extra bits that make Dubai Mall an \"attraction\" to visit. For me, unless you are coming to ski, Mall of the Emirates is much more a mall for locals living in Dubai to visit in order to avoid the busy tourist filled Dubai Mall"

This wasn't my first visit to the Mall after previous visits to Dubai, however during these last visits I noticed no seating inside the Mall, I did ask one of the security staff why ? he said the seats had been removed within the last 12 months and one reason being some young shoppers were littering around the seating areas !!! I'm not sure if this is true, shopping or window shopping can be fun and relaxing, taking a rest in-between is a bonus especially with families with young children and the aged. The only seating area is either in a restaurant or cafe. Overall the Mall itself is worth visiting with a great selection of shops with some high end fashion shops like Chanel / Dior and other top fashion designer labels. Mall of the Emirates metro station is the main entry point to the Mall unless you prefer catching a taxi or public transport bus, it takes a good 10 minutes to walk from the Metro Station towards the Mall, great air-conditioning through the walkway & inside the large Mall. Great Mall to visit for all ages and budgets."

Parking is straightforward, I would always recommend approaching from Shk Zayed road heading South and go straight to the top floor up the direct ramp. If you get caught in the actual car park it can be somewhat frustrating getting through it at busy times. Avoid peak times if possible on Thurs and Fri night. There is a cinema with gold class, various cuisines, loads of shops from H and M all the way up to the Designers, plus Harvey Nicks and Debenhams. `all up, easy to wander around and find all sorts of interesting things"

Before we left the mall to our hotel, we stop by at Carrefour inside the mall to buy bottle water and snacks for the kids. One stop shop."

It is not too large, it is well planned out and it is stocked with essential things that you need. It is a safe bet for shopping, picking up groceries, getting taxis, eating well and entertainment. It is easily my favourite mall in Dubai and I live closer to other larger malls in Dubai.The gargantuan Carrefour alone has everything you could ever need starting from groceries to electronics to garden furniture to household items. Some of it is tacky but if you need to do a big shop, you would be hard pressed to find better for cost-friendly grocery shopping in Dubai.The food court is probably bit of a let down but there are good restaurants near the ski area - that's right, this is the mall in Dubai with the indoor skiing facility."

It feels like the mall of emirates is more conservative than dubai mall. More women, men and children dressed in traditional clothing. You'll see more women in nhijab than in ordinary clothes. Officially they don't allow indecent clothing like tanktops, cleavage or showing of knees. But I don't know how hard they inforce it. No kissing or showing of affection in public, including holding hands with your boyfriend, is allowed. It's hypocrisy on a whole new level when they at the same time have posters of girls and women dressed in bikinis and underwear around the mall. We had a nice evening shopping (tanktops, short skirts, bikinis and other indecent clothing) but I get tired just thinking of the double game Dubai is trying to pull off."

With three floors of upscale and luxury shops which goes on and on, it certainly is huge.Though we didn't go skiing (not a huge attraction for someone from a place with good skiing), we did enjoy looking through the windows at Ski Dubai, the indoor ski area at one end of the mall. It has a chair lift (very slow), and a variety of snow-related entertainments (sleds, skis, sled runs, inflatable balls a person climbs in). What we really enjoyed is the spectacle of it all, with all the middle-eastern tourists and locals in their rented coats, boots and helmets experiencing snow. It was a blast.As for the shopping in the mall, my impression is that prices weren't that different from the USA or Europe, so it was more about people watching and seeing the extravagant stores. Where else to you see women in mini-skirts and women in full burqua with only eye-slits and hands showing? The clash of traditional muslim dress and western luxury results in a very interesting mix of people and activities. It's clear that visitors from Saudi Arabia and other conservative neighboring countries come here to shop for western items, and perhaps to let loose a little."

I wouldn't really say a romantic venue but a fun hangout for fun loving couples ;).The food options in the mall are aplenty and do have great patronage.

Decent food court, although the McD's there must be the most chaotic, frenetic, and disorganised branch on the planet - quite good entertainment actually!"

Only in Dubai could such an improbably huge, beautifully decorated mall be dwarfed by a different mall that's only a few miles away (that's the Dubai Mall). We initially came here to hug a penguin at Ski Dubai (yes, we're both adults) but left without doing so due to the $30 charge (we'll find a more reasonably-priced penguin-hugging experience in the middle of a desert, thank you very much!) Nevertheless, we spent a few enjoyable hours wandering around the Mall of the Emirates spending what remained of our dirhams. Check it out to glimpse the novelty of Ski Dubai."

The sight of a AED 2800 (approx \u00a3523) price tag of a cashmere scarf almost gave me a heart attack-- of course I kept on moving. My husband fared better as he got some good deals on (90% off) shirts at both the Azzaro and Pierre Balmain's end of season sales. Families with young children may want want to note that it can be a bit hard on the feet as seating is mainly restricted to the food courts. All in all, a chic Arabian mall that celebrates opulence."

MOE is also quite big, but more manageable on a single visit, and it has more shops for normal people. On our trip I ended up buying way more from MOE than Mall of Dubai.Mall of the Emirates has maybe a bit more limited choice of restaurants, and it's a bit more further away from Bur Dubai but those are hardly any problems.Word of advice: don't try to leave around 7 PM and go to Bur Dubai. We learned this the hard way. Our taxi spent fifteen minutes just to reach Sheikh Zayed Road only to be bogged down in even crazier traffic there. We then switched to metro which was packed on a Japanese scale."

Relatively easy to walk around without getting too lost, but do grab a map of the centre and this will make shopping a little easier.I did notice that a lot of stores did not stock everything. I couldn't find my size in a couple of items, yet when visiting other malls, they seemed to have quite a few of the particular item in my size, so this was the only disadvantage. I think most prices are expensive in Dubai, having visited a few centres, I really didn't find items cheaper elsewhere.There is a huge Carrefour supermarket here, great for picking up supplies.

The mall was, is and will always be as popular as before because this is the only mall in the Middle East with an indoor ski resort. Furthermore, the management of the mall have been smart enough to bring in famous foreign brands such as Cheesecake Factory and Ihop as tenants to maintain the popularity. Even though this mall is now the 2nd largest, it's still one of the must see malls in Dubai alongside Dubai Mall and Ibn Battuta Mall."

The suit\u2019s trousers needed some tailor adjustment and we left the suit with shop tailor for adjustment.Today Jan 27 we went to the shop to pick up the suit and found out that trousers are damaged by hot ironing. 2 salesmen witnessed that the trousers are damaged by extra hot ironing ( Russian speaking sales lady and another male salesmen). We asked to replace the damaged trousers or to refund AED 3265.00 which we paid for the suit. The salesmen advised us to come back after 3 pm the same day.\u00a0 After 3 pm today I visited the shop however the same salesmen and his 2 colleagues in a very rude way refused to refund or to replace damaged trousers, they told me that I have to take the suit and that suit was never damaged ( they slightly treated by steam the damaged part of trousers) I asked salesmen to introduce themselves. They refused to introduce themselves saying that it is private information , after I again repeatedly asked their names they introduced themselves by most probably fake names Vijay and Mustafa, Russian speaking sales women refused to introduce herself at all. Such a rude behaviour of Zegna stuff\u00a0 heavily spoil Zegna reputation, I have been shopping in Zegna shops worldwide since last 15-20 years and never faced such an unpleasant experience. \u00a0"

If you are excited about the possibility of saying you went snow skiing in the middle of a very hot desert, this mall is definitely worth a visit. (Keep in mind that you will pay about the same to ski at the little slopes in this mall as what you would pay on a low-mid level ski slope in the U.S.) As far as the mall itself goes, it's fine, but compared to the Dubai Mall, it's a bit lacking. It's still a big mall with a lot of stores and a lot of places to eat, though. If I could pick just one, I would pick the Dubai Mall. That being said, when it's hot outside in Dubai, spending an afternoon at the Mall of the Emirates might be a perfectly acceptable thing to do. It also has easy access via the metro."

The lack of seats/chairs inside the mall is astonishing though, people were sitting on the floor along the walk ways/corridors/shop fronts from exhaustion having walked around the shops for too long. Ski Dubai was a unique attraction and much bigger than I expected! Definitely worth seeing if you're in the area, and do not be afraid of the long taxi queues outside the mall as the queue moves really quickly with plentiful taxis waiting to take passengers."

Check out the tea place ( has a french name!!) amazing teas and the turkish coffee is a must try. Do eat the caramel macaroons!! Go have fun!! and when you had your full and want to head home and do not have the vehicle to go back, check out the taxi queues they serve you water in bottles and also have fans to cool you down!! ( I visited in the summers!!)...amazing hospitality"

It's got great little restaurants and is easy to navigate - no chance of getting lost here. There's also SkiDubai for more fun if you don't intend only to go shopping. When I use to live across the road from the MoE this place became my second home! Needless to say, you can window-shop and spent no money or you can shop till you drop. Either way, it's always fun!!"

The famous ski slope is there; yes, it's incredible to think of a real ski slope with a real lift, inside a shopping mall. But more than that, everything you could possibly need is inside this gargantuan space. From high end Chanel and Carolina Herrera to Top Shop and H&M, you will be guaranteed to find that for which you are seeking. Restaurants are there in a wide variety, too. Cheesecake Factory to ice cream shops to Paul's Bistro. A prayer room is on the top floor at one end. The Tram awaits you at another. Very impressive. Extremely well-done. Perfect location. Kempinski Hotel is attached and most highly recommended as well. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"

Don't get me wrong as a Mall its great - it has shops...so I guess I should really give it 5 stars for that. But its not a tourist attraction unless you like shopping at all the shops you can get in the UK. It's basically like visiting Westfield in London - so if you love shopping you'll love it here but don't go expecting a bargain - we found most products could be bought cheaper in the UK and it really is the same as a mall in the US or UK so if you want to go somewhere with more character it's probably best to visit the Souk Madinat."

It's a beautifully designed Mall inside with many top fashion shops with quality merchandise, not necessarily expensive & really depends what you're looking for or what your budget is !!! Unfortunately you can spend hours in these large Malls and I only spent 2 hours strolling around, mostly window shopping and into one of my favourite stores DIESEL taking a look at the their mens watch selection, being a watch collector and DIESEL being one of my favorite brand name. I would ocassionally forget myself looking for a cafe or a restaurant dying for a coffee and then realising nothing is open due to Ramadan.

You can spend hours in here, from the huge cinema complex, the Carrefour shopping, and Ski Dubai, which is really quite amazing. A completely different world and one you will never forget."

I bought way more clothing than expected, even some everyday clothing and tourist t shirts in the massive incredible Carrefour (must be 2-3 tones larger than any other carrefour I've seen in the Middle East or asia). The choice of fruits and bakery goods in this Carrefour was amazing, just jnteresykng to visit and see the labels where all the fruits originate (from Africa, Americas, asia and some even from New Zealand and Australia). No bad prices either, considering where you are in the world and quality of good was excellent, by far best fresh produce on offer I've seem in the muddle east!! The chattels and finishing a of this mall are a tad better in my taste than the bigger more famous cousin too. Plus the coffee shops and restaurants here are more international and cheaper too.Hence, if you want a little time out and not on a tour bus, have 1 night at least at a local hotel (both novatels are excellent for European and asian tourists and Walking distance to the hotel, 12-15 minutes in the oppressive 40s heat but not long out of the air con)!!!!Must see!

When entering the building you immediately are greeted by luxury sports cars and men wearing an overpowering amount of cologne. The smell permeates as you open the doors to the mall and breath in the air conditioning, then slowly fades in and out as you navigate the halls of one of the largest malls in the world. There are tons of options for dining, people watching, and of course clothes shopping. One could spend all day at the mall and not be bored. And last but not least is the notorious Ski Dubai where you can partake in several snowbound activities like ski, snowboard, Zorb, sled, and meet the penguins. There are activities for children and adults of all ages, and the prices are somewhat reasonable, so I definitely recommend you try it, they have all the gear for you and its included in the rental price, so check it out. And if you are not into snow sports, at least walk by and people watch from one of the local bars or restaurants that face Ski Dubai, you will be entertained for hours."

I have seen many many huge malls through my travel (Sao Paulo, Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, Paris, Panama...) and I have to admit that mall of the emirates is one of the biggest. Price wise, electronics are more expensive than in Asia (even w/o duty) and I was not in a mood to check out the clothing, but sales from 25%~75% will definitely beat anywhere else on the globe :)Also to notice how unreal it is to watch/do snowboard when it is 40C outside 0.o"

Despite the almost grotesque sights of an \"alpine\" ski lodge with roaring (fake, of course) log fires and the snow-covered pistes and chairlifts at one end, I thought MotE had a better atmosphere than Dubai Mall. So if you're into the whole Emirati obsession with shopping malls, I'd say that, in many ways, MotE should be top of your list. And yes, it too has a Virgin Megastore, as well as a Borders."

Food halls are definitely some of the best I've visisted) and you can't forget to visit Ski Dubai!

Navigating inside the mall is a bit challenging as there isn\u2019t enough way-finding signage. In fact except for the entry points I didn\u2019t see any way-finding signage at all. There is hypermarket in the mall too\u2026"

The mall itself is massive and has every store imaginable from grocery to high end brands. There are some unusual items including an inter ski hill. If you are coming from the US, you will recognize many of our favorite restaurants including, Cheesecake Factory, Shake Shake, P.F.Changs and of course McDonalds. The mall also caters to local and international options that will give you tastes of local culture."

The most alluring feature is the Ski Dubai in the mall. Unless you are going to be skiing, it's difficult to see the entire ski run from the \"free\" window areas. There are restaurants at the bottom of the ski run where you can eat and watch the skiing. If you go in January to Dubai, there are sales everywhere. I believe the dirham is tied to the US Dollar so it's not to hard to figure out fairly quickly the conversion rate. The mall is also easy to get to by taxi or by tram (trolley). If you just want to see a large mall, this is it. If you want to buy something different, this is it. If you want to walk and get in your exercise, this is it."

If you're a Modern Marvels show fan, then you've probably seen some excerpt on one of the episodes about the skiing area within this hotel. Being an engineer, I had to see it. So essentially, I didn't go to shop, I actually just went to SEE it on the first trip; went to SKI it on the second trip!Parking/traffic was somewhat of a nightmare the first time we went, but then again it was friday afternoon (their friday is our saturday). Once we got in we found a plethera of big name brand-stores (many of which I wouldn't be able to shop at....$$$). We pretty much went straight for the ski area since you can view it without entering. It was amazing. Well, amazing if you remember that you just parked in a desert and it was 90+ degrees outside. We didn't ski that day, but I did end up using the mall's primary function and bought a nice pair of Carrera sunglasses unavailable back in the US; so that was a score.The next trip I went back with more friends for the sole purpose of skiing. I must say, they've got everything covered! You can rent anything and everything. The facility is very clean and well kept. Then we got out into the ski area and it was wild. Now, it's got to be said that I'm from New England and I was raised skiing and we have some harsh winters. With that being said, it was pretty refreshing to feel the cold and snow when we were living in Al-Qusais (pretty much desert); 3 of us were from northern USA. OK, to review.....from New England....living in the desert....at an indoor ski resort. This is where reality sets in. While the ski park is an engineering feat to be proud of, it's still not a mountain. There, I said it. Being a skier/rider I was \"bored\" after the first run. But honestly, remembering the heat I'd return to outside, I had a blast; no matter how \"brief\" the run is! Also, I had to buy gloves and I still wear them; \"Ski Dubai\" on my gloves is like a conversation piece in it's own. If visiting Dubai, visit the Mall. Ski Dubai aside, the mall is amazing; but I feel the main attraction is the \"mountain\". Skiing isn't necessary, but it's neat to say you did it when people mention \"that ski mountain in the desert\"."

So no need to shop for jackets for a day. Shopping is also great, there are stores for high end brands, such as gucci, LV, Prada, Micheal Kors, CH and many many others. There are also stores with average prices, such as Aldo, H&M, zara and more. The amazing thing is that there is a store for everything; furniture, clothing, brands, electronics, etc. Restaurants are also great, there is a great variety to enjoy, there is a close by hotel as well.

This happened to me in American Eagle. So I went through the pile of jeans and found a pair the the staff had overlooked the original price had been 200AED and the new price sticker said 310AED. So, 310 minus their 40% discount is 186AED. Still cheaper than home so I purchased them. But it did explain why the shop wasn't packed with locals trying to get in on the 'bargain'.- Speaking of which do check prices at home first, some things may be stupidly more expensive e.g. A particular box of Lego I wanted was more than twice the price in Dubai. - Of the two food courts I preferred the one at the Ski Dubai end of the mall. It had a lot more variety."

Every drinking water is in a bottle. We were dying for air condition and knew that the mall would offer the best relief. We took the bus from Jebel Ali port to go up to the mall. The trip would take 45 minutes- A great opportunity to take a nap. The bus arrived at the mall, and we descended from the bus. We entered the mall. Immediately, the mall surprised me. In the entrance of the mall, I saw a fountain. This fountain had horses designed on it! There was no way that I would pass up an opportunity to take pictures of this. After taking pictures, we decided to walk through the mall. This mall would offer many fancy stores such as Tiffany\u2019s and Rolex. I told myself that I would go into bankruptcy if I brought my wife and daughters to this mall.  After walking around, we found two important places that we had to stop- Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts. We found them surprising that both donut shops would be in a country such as UAE, but they were their beckoning us to eat a donut or two. John wanted to go to Krispy Kreme because he is from North Carolina, which Krispy Kreme stores are popular in the Carolinas. As for Adam, he wanted to coffee from Dunkin Donuts. For him, he is from Massachusetts where Dunkin Donuts are widely popular in the New England states. Robert and John decided to go to Krispy Kreme whereas I went with Adam to Dunkin Donuts. These donuts shops surprised us because no one thought the people of UAE had a sweet tooth for donuts. One unique feature that I thought was smart was the escalators. These weren\u2019t your ordinary escalators. These allowed a person to take his or her shopping cart up to the next floor- escalators floors were flat instead of having stairs. Another unique feature of the mall- and a cool one at that- is the indoor snow playground. I didn\u2019t get an opportunity to play inside, but if I had the opportunity, I would. The playground had a slide that you can go bobsledding on. For many people in UAE, this place is the closet they will see actual snow.  Personally, I believe that once you visit the Dubai Mall; you will realize how small this mall is. Even so, this mall is still worth a visit."

Even considered giving it a go just to say we did. Instead chose to eat at a lovely Lebanese restaurant (Karam Beirut) overlooking the skiing area and enjoyed a wonderful meal and great service.An interesting thing about the mall... other than the restaurants there is no place to sit.

If you're after shopping it's a good choice. There's shopping for all budgets I would say, it's definitely not all top end designer ware. For example, my wife found the Nine West store prices much much lower than in Australia. We had a 7 year old and no issue bringing children here and we felt really safe. There's lots of eating options and there are also food courts on the ground floor at each end (east and west). It has its own metro station but taxis are easier I found and inexpensive.

This mall has everything you could possibly want, but with size comes price and most things were expensive by AED and AUD standards. Definately worth a look if you are in Dubai and have time to spend wandering aimlessly through a vast array of shops."

It,s strange to see people inside a mall shopping in Carrefour with checkouts in the mall."

It was 2 floors simple to walk along one side and back down the other had all the shops we needed. an incredible supermarket too inside where we could pick up all the things that make a stay more pleasant. Great fruit, crates of water for the car and weetabix for my 3 year old. Parking was much easier here than at dubai mall and the indoor ski slope is very impressive the food court is a lot more strait forward too. All in my favourite mall, possibly in the world!"

Mostly filled with designer wear and jewellery, it also has a nice Multiplex Cinema and Grocery store. The mall has an enormous variety of food stalls and restaurants with anything you can wish for. There is one entrance that has valet parking, you will find a number of very exquisite and nice cars parked out for display of shoppers who are at the mall. That would give you an idea about the prices and brands in the mall.The famous inside skiing and bob sleding is also located in the mall. With every ticket you get free gloves and coats etc which is a great thing because it is very cold inside. Good thing is that there are a number of cafes close by where you can warm up after visiting the winter wonderland in the country that was a desert"

The shops are just like the shops to be found in many large town high streets, Debenhams, Marks & Spencers and even has a large Carrefour (forerunner to Asda in UK) on the ground floor. I love the shoe shops in this mall including a very nice Kurt Geiger shop. The architecture of this mall is simple but fantastic and of course who could forget to mention the penguins at Ski Dubai. Something very surreal eating at TGI Friday's and watching them snow board and ski the otherside of the window. This mall also has Magic Planet and has a very good bowling alley. The only thing I would say that is slightly annoying is the people in the middle of the 'streets' with their little counters who are always showing something under your nose and asking you to look, sniff or generally buy. If I was a tourist I might find this even more annoying."

It is (apparently) smaller than its gargantuan cousin, and yet they still manage to fit a ski slope in there, complete with chair lift. Nothing is missing from this facility, but it does seem more manageable and less crowded. The architecture is amazing, the highlight being the grand atrium, reminiscent of the grand train stations of the past. Prices appear to be a little more moderate, and in my opinion, Debenham's and M&S are much better here than at DXB mall. The metro station is (thankfully) only a short, covered walk away, but still travelators will assist you if you have worn out your feet bargain-hunting. Instead of Waitrose, you will find a massive Carrefour on the ground floor, and there is hardly any waiting time to get a table at the Cheesecake Factory. If I had to pick between this mall and its grand relative, this one definitely wins, but in the Las Vegas of the Middle East, with its insatiable appetite for consumerism, this mall may sadly end up being 'so five minutes ago.'"

This Mall is laid in a fairly traditional manner (at least from a Canadian's eye) but it is big. Big in terms of walking space, while Dubai Mall is bigger in number of stores, it is more compactly laid out. Thus the confusion folks may have that this Mall of the Emirates (MoE) is confusing.As I have written in my reviews of Dubai Mall (DM) and Dubai Marina Mall (DMM), they basically have all the same stores. There are specific differences - DM has their Souk, DMM has WaitRose foo store and some specialty shops, and MoE has the Ski Dubai, plus the Fashion Galleria. The Fashion Galleria is fun because of the atmosphere. The stores are the same as the other malls, in most respects.Like the other malls, the food choices are overwhelmed by chains of fast food, instead of local or regional food. But then again, unless you go to Deira, getting local / regional food in the new Dubai is pretty challenging anyway. Unless you have a car and want to brave the crazy traffic."

On the ground floor there is a large food corner, with a large selection of Asian, American and European food.

Rest assured, almost anything you buy in Dubai Mall is likely to be costlier. This place felt less 'touristy' and might explain a bit about the cost. A case in point is Carrefour, a chain-super market. Nothing beats stocking up on local goods to take back home from Carrefour.MoE has it's share of Perfume shops (Ajmal, Rasasi and Abdul Samad Al Qureshi ASAQ), souvenir and Branded clothes shops.If you really wanted bargains and don't care about brands, you would probably look at Meena Bazaar or Naif Market or venture boldly into more traditional markets in Sharjah / AbuDhabi.To keep kids occupied, it has Ski Dubai, Magic Planet etc. Although large floor space is devoted to these, I feel only older kids would appreciate these.Overall suggestion: Window shop at Dubai Mall and buy at MoE"

Did not go in this time, but have seen it earlier. Overall MoE is a good mall to go to in addition to Dubai mall. Best way to reach is metro, though we also used our vehicle."

In extremely close proximity to my hotel made me give this place a full 5 rating which might be biased but this mall had it all in terms of the variety and range of shops from mid range to the most lavish. The cinemas were at par with most you'll find in Dubai.With multiple food courts you can find most to eat from arabic to fast food to continental.The best thing about this place was the snow park and skiing.

We decided to visit this mall mainly to see Ski Dubai, plus it was nearby the Burj Al Arab (we had dinner reservations & wanted to kill some time before hand). The mall is large with 520 shops, 85 coffee shops/restaurants, a magic planet family entertainment area, & 14 screen cinema. It has 2 levels. The mall is easy to navigate around. It has the largest Carrefour supermarket in the city. We spent just about 3 hours here & still didn't see everything in the mall. I found the currency exchange (UAE Exchange Centre LLC) in the mall, across from Carrefour, had the best exchange rate (US to AED). We saw Ski Dubai, but we did not try it as we have excellent access to skiing nearby Vancouver. Its a shame tho, you can't really see people skiing if you are viewing from the mall side. Unless there is a spot that I don't' know of. You can only see people playing in the snow park area. There is an Arabian souk area. The high end shopping stores are bunched together in the middle of the mall. The mall is attached with the metro station. The mall also provides a complimentary shuttle bus service, which will pick up and drop off at a number of hotels on Sheikh Zayed Road and along Jumeirah Beach. You can catch a taxi @ the front main entrance. Sometimes there are long queue for a taxi, but it moves along quite quickly. I would only recommend this mall if you are going to actually do the Ski Dubai or if you prefer a smaller mall then the humongous Dubai Mall. With so many shopping choices, after awhile they all seem the same."

Excellent food courts again from cheap (KFC, McD) through to expensive. There are several major brands almost permanently selling at big discounts (Azzaro, Balmain, Pierre Cardin, Timberland, Columbia). Connected to the Metro and massive car park. During cooler months its best to drive to top floor where there are nearly always parking spaces. Only issue I find is the variability of the Security Staff when you ask for directions, sometimes extremely friendly , knowledgeable and helpful, sometimes the complete opposite."

And some non-sale items were unique or interesting enough that I felt ok paying the asking price, even if it didn't seem great value.It was handy to be staying at the adjoining Pullman hotel, since it was easy to return to the hotel periodically to offload the shopping haul.Pretty cool to have Ski Dubai - indoor skiing - available within the Mall too, even if all you do is watch it while enjoying a coffee."

Ski slope is great fun- even for older folk, who just want a gentle wander through the caves and snow- then a movie- it is all there.

You can go to the hotel that is conected with the mall and you can enjoy your coctail there."

If one were to have a free day to spend some time - this is the way to do it. It is a bit of a ways from the airport (DXB) and lots of other attractions however. Probably about 20 minutes drive with taxi from the airport - traffic depending.

They also have a great Carrefour hypermarket and two hotels!! Another advice would be to follow them on twitter, they give constant notices and updates on the shopping deals, and if you ever have a question, they do answer you back on twitter in such a kind and gentle way that you feel very welcome!"

There are any number of eating places in the mall, all serving wonderful meals. Carrefours is also located within the mall, so if you need or want to do grocery / food / fruit, then its all there. Some of the prices in the shops seemed to me to set at 'tourist' prices, so you need to think about 'value' if you're going to be buying gifts for the family or even yourself.My wife and I went to the movies there one night and had a great time - its fascinating to sit in an English language movie and see it with Arabic and French sub titiles.

The mall has a bit of everything -- of course it has a ton of shops, but there's a good, diverse food court, and even an indoor (and by now infamous) ski slope which can be viewed from inside the mall via the glass panes. A big bonus is the mall's proximity to a Dubai Metro station -- an air-conditioned bridge leads from the metro directly into the mall and vice versa, which is invaluable in the summer months.All in all, a very good mall. It's grand, it's accessible, and it's got lots to offer. It's also easy to get lost in, so the first thing every visitor ought to do is to get a mall directory and map. There are surprisingly few physical stands with the maps, so be sure you get the little handbook.Also, if you're short of time on your trip as we were, this mall is not far at all from Souk Madinat Jumeirah -- it's about a 15 minute drive away, so you may want to consider taking a cab from here for that.

They will get tired and cranky after a few hours and you will only be a third of the way through. To thoroughly enjoy this mall, go alone as a couple or only with kids from the preteen age up. Otherwise, it is a very wonderful place to be in. The architecture from outside is simply FAB especially if you are viewing from the train."

However, as we found later on, it appears on the Mall's map, so don't forget to include it in your 'to visit' list, if you're interested in buying such devices.

Same with clothes shops: most of the brands, if not all, are known european or american brands. Yet, I have never seen aplace where I could find them all in one place, in one city! From luxury brands like Channel, Armani, YSL to H&M, Zara and River Island. And many, many many more! If you're there on a Monday and like sushi, I would suggest you to have dinner at the restaurant in the entrance where they offer all you can eat very good quality sushi on Mondays for 25 euro only"

It is very big as all things in Dubai so you need to scout out shops if you're looking for something specific. There are many London west end shops here along with the designer brands. My boys (9 and 7) wanted to buy nintendo games and boy are they expensive here! With 5.7 dirhams to the pound, most games were around the 250 mark, ouch! I convinced them to buy them from back home.There is a really good food court catering for everyones needs and desires but it was so busy even at 4pm and we took around 15 minutes to get a table. Some food outlets only take cash so take some with you, although there is also a currency exchange service there too. It's nothing spectacular and not something to go out of your way to see unless you're a shopaholic!"

This mall is a bit of a disappointment, especially after Dubai Mall opened, the choice of outlets is out done, the location of the prayer room is very inconvenient. You cannot find anything in the mall, very poor maps and the fold out maps are incomplete and poor. There is not a lot of staff to help. They charge an arm and a leg for parking, we went during the week and they stated at the parking the first 4 hours are free, we were there for 4 hours and 12 minutes and they charged us 20Dhs, I asked the staff and they said one minute over the 4 hours and you are charged for the 4 hours. Bad, so bad. If you have not been to Ski Dubai that is a reason to visit. The two major problems I have stated are major and I certainly do not intend to visit this mall again unless they seriously make some changes. The mall is beautiful otherwise."

In the week days, if you come by car, you have to take a ticket at the gate but, if you stay less than 2 hours you don't need to pay anything. In the week end the access is free. The main attraction of this mall is the ski Dubai. I cannot comment too much on that because I only went to the \"children\" part of it, where you can play a little in the snow and enjoy the cold, but I didn't ski. You can rent warm clothes and all the equipment but some people who do it \"seriously\" have their own ski equipment. There are sport shops where you can find everything for winter sport! Otherwise, there are many cinemas, a very big food court, other restaurants and cafes and a good selection of shops, from the most luxury like Dior and Vuitton, in the new extension, to the bargains one like Splash and Forever 21. If you need some grocerie shopping, there is a good Carrefour, which can be very useful, even if you stay in a hotel. There you could also buy some souvenirs but there is a nice souvenirs shops in the mall called \"al Jaber\" (if I remember well). Mall of the Emirates is a pleasant mall, quite family oriented and I would recommend it."

It was freezing inside but it was super fun. It was my best activity in Dubai. The attendants are very accomodating, they offer information and answers to ignorant questions from 2 girls from the tropics graciously. THe sledding was okay, fun but hard to capture on camera, the snow tubing was great, we got one for two people and the crystal ball was super fun, you get to roll off a steep slope inside a bubble ball. I have been to other places trying to do a Snow City Theme, either the slope for sledding is too short or the snow on the slopes are too thinly layered that you get to see the stainless sheet forming the base of the slope. While in Ski Dubai, the snow /ice was layered deeply, you can even go snow digging without reaching the bottom. the lifts were great for getting an overall view of the attraction, it is really humongous, what it great also is when you go sledding down, they have provide thoughtful conveyor belts going back up to lessen your energy for truding to save it more for sledding. Even it is an all day pass, by the second hour, you can feel the chill through the bones , you have to thaw out in the mall and get right back in. Great idea for fun in a mall in a desert country, who can beat that !"

This was on my wifes \" Things I must see \" list on our holiday in Dubai , so after putting aside a day to go to the Mall Of The Emirates the next thing to do was plan how we could get there and back , it wasn,t as hard or expensive as we thought .Consulting the street map from the hotel lobby ( we were staying at the Hyatt Regency ) and a few handy pointers by the ever helpful staff there it was decided to take a taxi down to Union Station and then the train to Mall Of The Emirates on the Jebel Ali line .At a total cost of only $7.50 AUD round trip for the both of us this made it very good value , the trains are the latest and very clean , quick and as I noticed totally un maned which is a little disconcerting at first until you get used to the idea .Having arrived at the Mall Of The Emirates ( the stations are announced in english and arabic on board the trains .) we were pleased to see that we didn,t have to walk thru the heat to get inside as there is a air conditioned walkway provided to the mall but once inside WOW ! this place is massive although not the biggest ( Dubai Mall is Bigger ) it shore does impress with it,s shear size , space and variety , the best tip i can give you here is to get hold of a map of the floor plan on its many levels and use that to navigate around , these are available from the information desks dotted around the mall and if you still get lost there are always the fixed table maps at just about all the major intersections with the usual \" you are here \" red arrows on them ( once again in english and arabic ) .There is just about something for every body here from the classy \" Bling Bling \" shops that my wife loves so much to the almost K,Mart like department stores ( more my style ) .and everything in between , as far as food goes there once again there is everything for every taste from fast food ( burgers and chips ) to the more upmarket resturants and at very reasonable prices .The biggest attraction there of course is the ski slope \" Ski Dubai \" which for 180 Dirhams or $45 AUD will let you have ago on their 200m ski slope for 2 hours which of course I had to do regardless of the fact that I had not skied for almost 20 years but be warned the slope although it is a good length the surface is Really , Really icey with little or no powder on it so it is very fast and didn,t take much to get up ended as I found , much to my wifes amusement .Still after all that I was happy that I gave it ago ( didn,t come half around the world not to ) and there was a very nice cafe over looking the slope while drinking a loverly hot coco to warm up .It will take you a complete day to look around the whole mall and the only little , little gripe I would have with as seems to be the case with all the malls we visited , there just doesn,t seem to be very many places to sit ( apart from cafes and the like ) where you can rest those tired and sore feet and back a while .Getting back on the train to the city proved to us that timing is every thing , we boarded the train at about 4pm to find the train was packed obviously it is a popular form of transport here but in true Emirate style there was no pushing or shoving just an orderly boarding and alighting that made the trip a very memorable one back to our hotel .peter and sue"

The main attraction of this mall is Ski Dubai.It is the indoor ski resort with amazing snow setting to enjoy skiing, snowboarding and tobogganing or just playing in the snow. For Children there is Magic Planet which has variety of games and fun rides. This mall also has good retail fashion stores and Carrefour.After all the shopping and entertainment you can head towards the food court to grab a pizza, burger and drinks or for fine dining you can go to restaurants like Al Hallab, Chillis or More."

No place to sit ( no benches) , exept cafe, so if you tired walking, you have to go and find cafe to sit. Also really hard to find wash room. This small things make this big mall not comfortable for shopping!!!"

The Mall of the Emirates is a very nice Mall and visiting it is worth it, even if it can't reach Dubai Mall.It's easy to acces from the \"Mall of the Emirates Metro Station\" which connects the mall with the airport, downtown, creek area and Jebel Ali. It's also the cheapest way to go here with about 4.10 Dirham (0.90\u20ac)But the MoE can't reach the Dubai Mall, which has a much more inviting style. Aditionally, it was ramadan, and none of the two food courts inside the mall had a covered dine in area in contrast to Dubai Mall. Only the Kempinski Hotels Restaurant was open for dining in.In fact, the MoE is a nice mall, in which you can find everything you like, but it's not the best in Dubai."

I love browsing and buying items from the boutique stores like Christian Dior and Tod's. Whenever you go to this section of the mall, you feel like you're shopping along Rodeo Drive and the fact that you feel safe and well-taken care of by staff add to the good experience. The section has now easy access to the metro station which makes it more convenient for me to hop from one mall to another especially now that Dubai is celebrating DSS. More reasons to shop.\""

I had only two hours to do some shopping and I am happy that I choose this shopping mall. Great internal architecture, huge and diverse areas for shopping, dinning (check my review for Butcher Shop & Grill), even skiing! Even if you will not go snow-skiing in Dubai, you get images that add to the overall pleasant trip experience. Prices are almost the same as Europe unless you find clearence or sale bargains (e.g. 60% off Nike running shoes was a bargain that shouldn't be missed, but were only 3 pairs left)."

Yet this place is unreal. It's got it's own indoor ski slope. Come on!Despite all of the high-fashion stores in this mall, the one store that blew my mind was Carrefour. It's like Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy and the biggest grocery store around all combined into one store, then pumped up on steroids. I've never been in a store so big. Place was packed. Great place to do your one-stop shopping for souvenirs for everyone on your list, including yourself."

With all the big names at the mall on the top floor and a lot of high stree stores this is definatley a place to drop into. However do not go here expecting to find the big bargins other shopping malls in Dubai have to offer. Yes you can pick up the od cheaper item but by and large everything is not comprable if not sometimes more expesnsive than your home country or duty free. One store I noted was the Virgin store. I went looking to find an 160g Ipod. How disapointed I was to find all Ipod gear more expensive. I also noted that nost of the shops were now orientented towards the wealther customer. Although I would not dismis a visit just dont go here thinking you can buy all you Xmas presents at a knockdown price. My friend who has property in the city has notice an increase in prices across the board. This was just one of the let downs I had on my vist. By the way the Sky centre is very good if you can get in"

I have been to mega malls in the USA, UK, Singapore, Malaysia, Saudi, South Africa and UAE previously.The Mall of the Emirates is one of the two new malls built in Dubai since my last visit in 2004. I am not someone in awe with these structures as I have now visited so many.The gimmick of a ski slope is fine but to me its just froth. A fancy mall is no good to me if the shops in it does not have deals that can entice me to spend money. I'm looking for bargains.Dubai has bargains for jewellery, watches and used to be good for electronic products. Designer labels is not its forte but if you search hard you can strike a good deal.This mall is vast and is set on two floors. There is a big car park, plenty of entertainment. Apart from the ski slope, they have a cinema, a children's play area, arcade and a good selection of food places.Our kids had a great time in the play area and did not want to leave the arcade.There are a wide range of designer shops, electronic stores and a hypermarket. Walking around the mall you would not think that you are in Dubai but any other international cosmopolitan city given the diverse array of shoppers.At the time of my visit in February the French Connection store had good bargains. The Hypermarket was a good place to get cheap cigarettes for smokers in the family as gifts.But to me its just another mall. They did not have enough bargains for me to part too much of my cash."

But, like most of the things you see in Dubai....'Am i really in the middle of the desert!?'I have enjoyed the malls towards the Bur Dubai side more since they seem to be more established. The brands available at Mal of the Emirates are not as various as the other malls. The shopping experience just does not dawn on me when at the Mall of the Emirates. The mall has a couple of cafes that are pretty good....one worth mentioning is Paul's Cafe. I have heard the lebanese restraunt on the first floor is pretty good as well, little out of my budget."
