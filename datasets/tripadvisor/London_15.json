Great photos from the river ferries and across the river or on the bridge. Try to be there on the hour to hear the bells. It's a very short walk to Westminster Abbey as well. The Palace of Westminster where Big Ben sits can only be accessed inside if you are a British citizen."

Whenever near the Themse and with view on Westminster Palace, the clock tower (containing famous bell Big Ben) is visible or - best at full hour - to be heard.If you are in search of a perfect London postcard picture, make sure to have the tower in it (everyone knows immediately where you are, even though they may call the tower Big Ben). And do be bold and try different angles and views on the bell tower - from Parliament Sq, from the Abbey, from Westminster Bridge, from Lambeth or Vauxhall (footpath by the river) and, of course, from right underneath London Eye. Oh, and go at different times of the day (at least 2x) - it's worth it, as the atmosphere changes and so will your pictures (try to catch the evening sun).Do not be afraid to take funny pictures as well (jumping, hugging, leaning against, holding upright); there are so many tourists around you doing just the same! There are even great motifs of the bell tower to be found around Parliament Sq with red phone booths or - if traffic light helps you - with red double decker busses and black cabs in the front. We once caught all in one picture incl. the evening sun in the background.By the by, if you visit St. Paul's Cathedral - go up to the dome and take a picture from outside the dome in direction of Westminster Palace (the bell tower sticks out) with the surrounding sights like the Gherkin as well as London Eye and the bridges... A must-visit when in London for everyone!"

My first impression of the Big Ben, \"I thought it would be bigger.\" Haha, I really did say that when I first saw it. I guess the \"thing is 10 times bigger on screen\" have been proved again. Well, 10 times is a bit over the top though. but it really doesn't matter, the tower was still looking amazing, so iconic, and the clock just looked brilliant, magnificent, something old but still got it charm. The Details around the clock tower just caught my eyes, what a beauty. During my visit, I was even luck enough to here the strikes of Big Ben. And I was with my lovely hubby next to the river Thames.

While daytime views make for the best photo ops, be sure to catch a glimpse at night. The glow of all of the landmarks is spectacular. The best pictures of Big Ben may actually be across the Westminster Bridge along the Jubilee Walkway. But from any angle, it's London!"

I will say the foot traffic on the Westminster Bridge can be incredibly aggravating if you're just looking to cross to get to another attraction, and you have to continually be mindful not to get hit in the head with a selfie stick. People do not care if they are in your way or about to hit you with their cameras, it's all for the photo in their world. I would advise if you want photos not littered with other tourists early AM would be best, which during our stay for lighting purpose would have been at 4:30 AM. So it depends on how much it is worth it to you to get a photo without a billion people littering the way."

As the Elizabeth Tower is a historic symbol of the U.K., it was amazing to see it in person and hear the bells of Big Ben. Since it's free and right at a Tube stop (Westminster) it's absolutely worth a visit if you go to London. If you aren't going to be spending a lot of time in the area, make sure you go near the end of an hour so you can hear Big Ben. Also, the Tower is currently leaning (we watched some news on it while in London) due to the weight of Big Ben and this was noticeable in person - that was also beat to see."

This is a ballot and a bit of a faff doing it way in advance but but it was soooooo worth it. Utterly brilliant from start to finish. Plenty of steps but easily manageable for most especially as it is broken up into chunks with stops for informative talks and information on the way and a sit down. The guide was superb. Photos not allowed which usually I find annoying but it didn't matter this time. Views from the top amazing. Watching the hands turn, seeing the mechanism for this and the ringing of the bells was fascinating especially the adding of old pennies to the pendulum to make micro changes to the time. Walking behind the 4 faces was fantastic but the icing on the cake was actually watching the striking of Big Ben itself at 12 noon (with earplugs provided)....how many people can say they have actually seen this with their own eyes? I will never look at the clock and tower again without remembering this 90 minutes of my life! I am not usually easily pleased or quick to shower unabridged praise onto something but this was simply one of the best tours I have ever been on. And all for free! I would go back tomorrow if I could but am too late for the ballot and also it is closing for 3 years very soon for repair and refurbishment so you will have to be very quick. But even if you have to wait 3 years you must go, as even this long will be worth the wait. I think you can tell that I enjoyed this very much!"

I was sent the relevant security forms to complete and within two weeks received a response with a September date and time. So be prepared for a long wait.Upon arrival for my 9am tour (arrive at least 15 minutes early to get through airport style security) at Portcullis House (building across the road from Ben Ben), I submitted my health declaration and handed in my bag, which was locked away securely.My tour was conducted by Richard Bray, who was excellent! The tour began by crossing through the tunnel beneath the road, which led to the clock tower entrance. The climb was split into 4 parts, which made it far more manageable, with the first part being the most difficult (approx 140 steps). We then rested in a small room whilst Richard provided a good historical account of the tower and how it came to be.A further climb led us to the mechanism room which was fascinating! Another small ascent led us to the clock face, which I loved before finally ascending to the belfry in time to hear the 10am chime.We were giving ear plugs prior to this to prepare us.The tour was absolutely fascinating and I feel privileged to have have had the opportunity to visit up close and personal. Highly recommend."

I dont think there are tours of this tower anymore after 9/11, which is understandable, but you can do tours of the Houses of Parliment which I highly recommend you do. The best vantage point for photos of Big Ben is on the bridge crossing the Thames to London Eye. The cost is of course, free, but a must do look see for any and all tourists to London. The exterior of the Houses of Parliment are well worth seeing too, and as said before makes for an great photo op from the bridge"

The nearest tube is Westminster, which has (fee charging) toilets and step-free access to the tube. Big Ben is actually the name of the largest bell within the clocktower that forms part of the Palace of Westminster. It is architecturally stunning and well worth a visit. My favourite view is from the opposite side of Westminster Bridge, on the riverside walk around the side of the hospital. Step free access is tricky there but achievable - you have to go down Belvedere Street, take a left towards the river at the level of the London Eye, turn left when you reach the eye and continue until you pass through the tunnel under Westminster Bridge. Have a look over the stone balustrade at the level of the steps and see if you can spot the tiny gnome carved into the embankment.Toilets and refreshments are available in St Stephen's Tavern. There is also a supermarket in the block Westminster Station is in."

The tower is adjacent to the Houses of Parliament which are interesting to look at from the outside (going inside is not readily available to overseas visitors unless you plan some months ahead through your embassy, for UK residents plan ahead by contacting your constituency Member of Parliament). Also very nearby is Westminster Abbey a very old church where the coronations of many English Monarchs have taken place and you can go inside to admire the architecture."

If you stand half way up on the bridge you can take a pic of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben together. It appears smaller then you expect given its swamped by all the amazing architecture around it. A must see to tick off on your visit too London.

That's of course imagination and the house is still there and hopefully will always be as a representation of the will of the British people. Big Ben and Houses of Parliament are an amazing sight by night as well ... in fact by night they look much more amazing from the outside than by the morning and they are both a walking distance (15-30 minutes depending on how slim, fast and aged you are!) from Buckingham palace ... This is the walk you must take in London no matter what type or weather or which season it is."

The Abbey and Houses of Parliament are adjacent. Big Ben is the bell in the Elizabeth Clock Tower. Standing next to it when it tolls is amazing. However, it is not a lengthy undertaking. You will be able to get a good photo if in the area for the other attractions, on a Thames boat cruise, on the London Eye etc... Since you cannot go to London without going to Westminster, there won't be any difficulty seeing it. Immediately in front of it is a small grocery store (more like a convenience store) if you need to pick up a couple of snacks, drinks etc... There is also a good souvenir stand near the statue of Boadicea in her chariot. Caution: It is extremely crowded on the sidewalks in front of Big Ben. Watch your valuables."

It is centrally located so there really is no reason to *not* see it, at least from the outside. We stayed in London for three nights and saw it every single day, without even trying. The true experience I took home and have relived everyday since is the sound of Big Ben's toll on the hour. What a rush! To know that I have experienced that first hand is something that means a lot to me and is a memory I will treasure for the rest of my life.Visited August 2009"

There will be a magnificent light from the sun on the tower that makes it look like the tower was just photoshopped into reality! It is stunning. Hard to get a great picture from nearby, the best place to get as picture if from on the London Eye!You cannot visit the tower or go inside it unless you are a UK Resident and Citizen. Before I went, there was lots of confusion all over the internet with people saying that you have to be an EU citizen to go up, or that you had to be a British Citizen, or that you have to have a UK passport, but the TRUTH is, you need to be a UK Citizen AND Resident.This is a great icon to visit, and does not take long to see!

Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London,he clock and dials were designed by Augustus Pugin.5 August 1976: First and only major breakdown. The air brake speed regulator of the chiming mechanism broke from torsional fatigue after more than 100 years of use, causing the fully wound 4-ton weight to spin the winding drum out of the movement, causing much damage.Lovely place"

New tall buildings in London (like the London Eye, the Shard, etc.) make all the old buildings look a lot smaller, this is also the case with Big Ben. It is also very crowded around the tower. Best views can be had from a distance or from the London Eye.On a tour I heard that the tower will be covered soon for renovations."

UK residents can apply to their local MP and get a free tour of the houses of parliament and so save the tour price. The tour is pretty good but does mean you can't choose to visit whenever you want which would be a problem for people travelling down but excellent for people who live close to or in London like myself. We did the tour and there is lots of nice ornate rooms inside and some large halls as well as the house of commons chamber.

When Parliament is in recess (that's on holiday to you and me folks) there are tours available of the Houses of Parliament, both Commons and Lords combined. Tickets are available from the ticket booth that is normally found on college green opposite the House itself, the guides know their stuff and I was struck by just how small the commons is, and you can see why its a tight squeeze when all the MPs are sitting. Although I have only given the attraction 3 stars that is because I am referring to the Bell, the tour of Parliament is well worth 4 or maybe even 5 stars."

We didn't attempt to get inside the tower - no time available on our too-busy schedule, but if you want to see some clocks, head on over to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich; they have dozens of clocks on display. OK, Big Ben is quite unique, so every tourist has to go and take a photo and maybe hear the gonging; I'll give you that. You're probably going to pass it a dozen times or more during your stay in London because so many other attractions are right in the neighborhood (Eye, Parliament, #10 Downing Street, Churchill's War Room, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace)Enjoy your trip!"

For so many years having driven/walked past Big Ben and looked up at the Tower, it was a great feeling to be inside the tower and learning the history of the Elizabeth Tower and to touch the clock face! to walk up the stairs (334) and stand beside the bells as they chimed the hour. Looking out to lots of familiar landmarks , 360 degrees! it was a good sunny day, so that helped! There are a lot of stairs to climb inside the tower and not suitable for those with very young children. Need to pre-book the Tower tour. These tours are only open to UK residents and booked through your local mp. Refurb works due to take place so may not be open for much longer, for a little while. We visited sometime ago!"

The hourly dong was so loud!! You can walk to Buckingham palace and St James' Park from Big Ben in 10-15 mins and it's an enjoyable walk as you recognise all the areas that you've seen on the telly so many times! The London Eye is also a 5 minute walk (along the Westminster bridge) from Big Ben, you can see it very clearly when stood next to Big Ben. The only thing I was surprised about was its size; I was expecting it to be A LOT bigger!!!"

Going to Big Ben and seeing this iconic building is a task..... so many people crossing and the hugeness of the clock is so massive as it takes a real photographer to get the whole image. The secret is if you go down the road you will see the bicycle lane and across a small landing area- this is the area you go and have your picture taken, no photo bombers and you get the whole view and enjoy it from there. Another tip is see this clock at night but get ready to spend time since 9pm it is still bright and only around 10Pm that it starts to get dark, and then you see the view of the parliament at night - what a view to watch for- patience is a must,,,,,,,,,"

Try not to wave in the background though, these people have no sense of humour at all.Also remember that this part of London enjoys frequent demonstrations.

The one hiccup we had was a guy dressed as Charlie Chaplin who approached us to take a selfie and then demanded \u00a340 from us and since I didn't have them on me I told him that I would delete the pictures from my phone which got him upset and we almost got into an argument...Long story short, I ended up giving him the \u00a320 that I had on me and he was still upset! So my advice to you is be careful when some characters approach you to take pictures, they don't want $2 dls like in Times Square!!"

The tower is officially known as Elizabeth Tower, renamed in 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The tower holds the second largest four-faced chiming clock in the world (after Minneapolis City Hall). Its familiar ring is caused by a crack which appeared in 1859, within a few months of the bell being installed. The Elizabeth Tower and Great Bell have been scheduled for a major renovation, which is expected to last three years and is due to begin in early 2017. Essential maintenance will be carried out on the clock mechanism, which will be stopped for several months - during which there will be no chimes. Striking and tolling will however be maintained for important events. The 320' tower is the most enduring symbol of the British people. The famous chimes are still recognized throughout the world. I have been able to find out that the two times Big Ben was silent were for Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill\u2019s funeral in 1965 and for Baroness Margaret Thatcher\u2019s funeral in 2013. The Elizabeth Tower is not open to the general public. However, UK residents can book a tour of Elizabeth Tower to see Big Ben. Free Exterior - Tube Station: Westminster"

You'll have to come up with your own reasons why you want to see the clock if you don't have a UK passport.

It is the bell tower of the Houses of Parliament that dominate Parliament Square. Big Ben's chimes signify the exact hour and the tower is illuminated at night if Parliament is sitting. Laid out in 1868 the Houses are an impressive work of architecture. However, the site also known as the Palace of Westminster, dates back to 1097. One portion - Westminster Hall - is open to visitors. With its hammerbeam roof it is considered one of the finest of Europe's medieval buildings. Big Ben itself is not open to the public. But, it is the jewel at the heart of some of London's most famed sites. It is also a must for any tourist with a camera."

Elizabeth Tower is often mistakenly referred to as Big Ben \u2013 but it is the huge bell at the top of the tower which is named Big Ben. This bell has a weight of about 13,000 kilograms. The tower is over 150 years old. The nearest underground station to get to the tower is Westminster.The dial of the clock is about seven metres in diameter. The dial hands are about 4 metres long. It is an accurate clock that is regulated by a mechanism of weights and pendulums.Big Ben has survived the German bombings in the second World War. Each New Year\u2019s Eve, thousands of people gather to hear the chimes bringing in the New Year.The Tower is not open to the public. It is due for a facelift starting in early 2017 \u2013 and so I would recommend that you visit Big Ben before the scaffolding goes up before the start of the refurbishment programme scheduled to last about three years.I think that the best place to view Big Ben is on Westminster Bridge approaching from the South Bank towards the Houses of Parliament."

So if you plan to visit in that period, you may be disappointed as you may not get a view of this iconic clock."

Americans cannot go up Queen's Tower to see Big Ben (bell inside the clock). Only UK residents can go up there. My son is nine and we are American. He did not quite grasp how the British government operates. I am happy to report post tour that we both have a clearer understanding of the intersection between the Monarchy and Parliament. Our tour, the Queen's Experience recreated the Queen's Opening of Parliament Ceremony. This tour is currently running limited weekends. Check the website to book tickets. The tour was an hour and the guide did a good job involving the kids in the group. I would recommend it."

This includes the beautiful Victoria tower, named after the great Monarch from England's past. Across the street is Westminster Abbey, the most famous church in England if not the world. There are many statues throughout the square, and you are steps from Whitehall.Stop by the Churchill War Rooms, and take a stroll through St. James Park. All within a few minutes of Big Ben.

From the west townside Big Ben is mostly hidden and cannot easily be seen so you more or less happen to suddenly end up right in front of it, as happened to us first time we went to see it.Approaching from either across or along the Thame it can of course be spotted from quite a distance due to its unique look. I've already seen quite a lot of parliament buildings but each time I see Big Bena and the Houses of Parliament I continue to think that it is one of the most beauitiful ones in Europe. So coming here and having a look is of course a must, as well as is listening to its famous sound for the full hour. For taking pictures of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament in one view I would recommend to do this from across the Thame or from one of the Bridges nearby. Best lighting would then be between sun rise and noon. In the afternoon you will have good lighting for a selfie just with the Big Ben from the west near the Churchill statue."

Then the big part comes when you get up into the belfry at the stroke of the hour and you are standing right infront of old BIG BEN himself. When it happens and the gongs go and the tune, with the rumble of the bell at the end. And the view it excellent looking down over London and the rest of parliament.Was AMAZING to see. You have got to be British to go up. Write to your local MP for the area you live in and get tickets. They are free. But you do have to get permission from your MP. Email them with your Name Address Postcode Phone numberAnd say you want to tour Big Ben. There are no toilets on the tour.No drink apart from water which is allowed. You need to be quite fit to do the climb there are no lifts up.  And no cameras or phones allowed either. But all in all it was a great thing to do and would recommend anyone to try it.

Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Parliament and the London Eye (among other things) are all relatively close together. This will also put you right next to the Thames River which is super cool. Big Ben lives up to it's name, it's massive! There's a good sized empty grass lot right across the way (next to the Churchill statue) that's a great area for photo snapping. If you're planning to be in central London, these sites are totally worth it!"

Will not disappoint to see all the well known sites we come to know from our studies in the U.S., however, one of the most informative small bit of info I found interesting was the story of the iconic tall tower's clock Big Ben \u23f0 at the palace of Westminster. Maybe it is a very known story in England and the rest of Europe but Big Ben is not the official name! The history as well as value are priceless. The tower is offically known as the Elizabeth Tower renamed in 2012 former name the Clock Tower. For me it is as recognizable as NYC Statue of Liberty in the U.S. worthy of 5 stars\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50"

Surrounded by the Houses of Parliament on one side and Westminster Abbey on the other. I've yet to meet the person who has gone to London that hasn't come home with a pic of Big Ben. But the best place to take a pic of this area is on the London Eye. Yep, grab a ticket let the wheel go around until its at its zenith, (approx 15 mins into the ride), and then take your pic. You'll have the most fantastic shot of all that I've mentioned. It really is worth the price of the Eye's ride. A Kodak moment if ever there was one"

It's a lovely area, but be careful when crossing the road to get pictures of Ben and your loved one, or the obligatory selfie. the tourists just seem to take over the roads and walk where they want, but the are clearly demarcated and there are very few crossings, take thew time to walk all the way around and find them safely. Last time I was there a family of American tourists amused my by standing on the steps out of parliament to make family photos with Ben in the background and blocked approx. 50 Londoners who were ropable! It really does pay to be polite and thoughtful in London - the locals really do appreciate it ;)"

Visiting London was really amazing since in the time of around 5 hours I got to experience 2 world wide known tourist attractions, and also got to visit Madame Tussauds that is close to London Eye and is a famous building with wax dolls of different famous people. That is the favorite thing I enjoyed about London, in almost the same place you get to visit 3 wonderful places & also during the Queen's Walk there are a lot of tasty snacks you can buy that I otherwise can't because I live in Sweden.It was a great experience, and I would really recommend it to anyone if you're traveling with friends, couples or family it gives you a great experience either way for not a lot of money."

This clock tower is one of the most iconic sights in London and it does not disappoint. It's located adjacent to Westminster Abby and the Queen's Horse Guards, as well as other iconic London sights. The best part is it does not cost even a pound to get your photo taken with this London landmark in the background behind you and it's a great landmark to visit Rain or Shine! Just make sure you have your rain gear if it's wet out when you go. Big Ben is right off of the Westminster Tube Station and you can plan a trip to visit it in conjunction with a trip to Westminster Abby or The Queen's Horse Guards. Your can't visit London without hearing the iconic bell chime ring out, so make time to see this great landmark of London History! You can even get to it from any of the Hop On / Hop Off Bus Tours. Ben will put a smile on your face and make you want to come back to hear the amazing sound that comes bellowing out again and again!"

It's a beautiful clock tower that is worth seeing even if that's just visitng Parliament Square and taking it in, as well as the house and Westminster Abbey. However, if you're a UK resident you can arrange to actually climb Elizabeth Tower (which is the tower where Big Ben - the bell - resides). You just need to find your MP online and write to them to request tickets and they will arrange this for you. When you finally get offered tickets it can be some months away which is worth bearing in mind, but don't let that get in the way of you having this unique rare opportunity to stand literally on the inside of the four clock faces and to be right by Big Ben and the other bells when they chime - you are given ear protectors but the chime goes right through your body. It's certainly something to consider."

Left sidewalk of the Westminster Bridge across Big Ben As this is the best spot, it is always crowded with tourist, especially past 9 am to an hour after sunsets. Avoid back light by taking picture in the morning to early afternoon. As the sun sets behind Big Ben, taking pictures of Big Ben from this side in the afternoon (within 2 hours before sunsets) could be frustrating to non photographer which only equipped only with camera phone. (dark results)2. From London EyeYou can get full aerial view of the Big Ben and the Parliament House by taking a ride on board the London Eye Capsule (regular ticket: GBP25/person). Take the far right corner of the capsule for best view (if there're other tourists occupying this very spot, politely ask for your turn). Try to take picture during Blue Hour (30-1hr after sunsets) to get beautiful bright blue sky color in the background and that's also when you can picture Big Ben and the Parliament House with their beautiful lighting on.3. Right sidewalk of the Westminster Bridge in line with Big BenThis spot won't give you full background of the Big Ben and the Parliament House, but still give you a good iconic shot of Big Ben. This side is not as crowded as the side across Big Ben, so quite convenient during tourist rush hour (from 9 to sunsets). You can get a good picture with London Eye in the background too. There could be back light within 2 hours before sunset.4. The Parliament SquareYou can get the perfect pictures of London icons with caption like \"Too Much London in One Picture\". From this spot you can have Big Ben, the Parliament House, the London Eye, the iconic London black cabs and red buses all in one frame.Happy photo hunting!"

In 1844, it was decided the new buildings for the Houses of Parliament should include a tower and a clock. A massive bell was required and the first attempt (made by John Warner & Sons at Stockton-on-Tees) cracked irreparably. The metal was melted down and the bell recast in Whitechapel in 1858. Big Ben first rang across Westminster on 31 May 1859. A short time later, in September 1859, Big Ben cracked. A lighter hammer was fitted and the bell rotated to present an undamaged section to the hammer. This is the bell as we hear it today."

The tour starts with a short warning about health and general fitness so if you do not feel fit enough to walk up approximately 330 steps or you suffer from heights then this is probably not the tour for you. That said, the walk is taken in stages and the guide was excellent at making sure everyone was ok and taking it at their own pace - this isn't vertical rush! The guide was excellent at talking you through the history of the tower, its inception, building and development through to the current day. While it was a history lesson it was accessible and interesting. Having stood outside parliament many times and watched Big Ben chime, to be able to stand behind the clock face was an incredible experience, to then stand by the bell as it chimed mid-day really was the icing on the cake. You get ear plugs and a warning that the bell is about to chime so don't worry. I would recommend that you leave yourself some time after the tour to have a look at the first floor of Portcullis House and the incredible paintings of some of our more notable MPs and PMs - something you would not otherwise be able to access if you were not on this tour. I would also recommend travelling light, you are not able to take photos or bring anything with you on the tour. There are lockers where your belongings are kept safe. Arrive a bit early if you can so that you can visit the toilets as there are none while on the tour."

There are many other facts and figures you'll learn when you visit. You need to arrange this in advance through your local MP. . In my experience, my local MPs office got back to me in 2 days and organised a time to suit my party. Info you need to know: All visitors allowed onto Elizabeth Tower/Big Ben tours must be UK residents. No exceptions. Visitors must be over 11 years old. Visitors must be able to climb all 334 steps unaided without assistance. Visitors with heart-related illness or who are in the later stages of pregnancy will not be allowed. Visitors must arrive with sensible footwear, or they will be declined their position on the tour. It's a fantastic experience. Well worth organising. And much to do in the Westminster area. Good historic pubs dotted around, Westminster Abbey ...."

I applied for a free tour by writing to my MP back in Sep 2015, I got my appointment for 9 march so it does take a bit of time but is free and the only way you can climb the tower and actually see the bell. You must arrive at the scheduled time promptly. The tour takes about 90 mins total. There are about 337 step but you don't take them all at once, about 3 stops at rooms at different levels of the tower with the most steps at once being about 100 I think. You are not allowed to take photos and there are two guides (one in front, one behind) so no chance to take any photos unless you want to get in trouble! The tour guide is very knowledgeable and we stopped at one room to talk about the history, then another room where we were level with the clock faces and another where the main machinery of the clock is located and then the last level where the bells are - you get given earplugs as you arrive to hear the bells chime at top of the hour, it was for 15:00 for our tour. The views at the top are pretty amazing as you can see all around London, though it is very windy! Wonderful experience made better for the fact that our MP was on the tour and had some time before her next meeting so took us to see Westminster Hall and we got to sit in the House of Lord and House of Commons - a great afternoon."

There's not much to say about it apart from it's a clock and it's big. Just be careful as the crowds are very large and I can imagine that it is a pickpockets paradise. I found the area a little unsettling due to the groups of gangs with various nationalities simply hanging around on the corners.

Having been Grade 1 listed in the 1970s has ensured that this enduring totem pole, dedicated to the priapic ruminations of Victorian architects, has stood the test of time by being constantly maintained. It is \"Gothic Revival\" in design, so if it was next door to your house it would probably creep you out at night time, not just drive you mad with it's constant donging (see architects ruminations above...). Can be viewed from the car, a taxi, on a Boris bike, on foot, on your parents' shoulders and from the back of a police van (if you are one of the long-standing protesters outside on the pavement). It faces the famous 'democracy' lawn for the UK, but then Parliament passed an Act in 2012 banning the public from blocking the pretty view across the grass which resulted in long-term, anti-war protester (10 years) Brian Haw and his badge-laden Woody Allen hat being moved on. Sadly Brian died in 2011 in Germany. I do miss not seeing his tent as I pass in the morning."

The Elizabeth Tower, aka Big Ben, is among London's most iconic landmarks \u2013 a \u2018must see\u2019 for anyone visiting London.Big Ben is the name given to the massive bell inside the clock tower, which weighs more than 13 tons (13,760 kg). The clock tower looks spectacular at night when the four clock faces are illuminated.Each dial is seven metres in diameter and the minute hands are 4.2 metres long and weigh about 100kg. The numbers are approximately 60cm long and there are 312 pieces of glass in each clock dial. A special light above the clock faces is illuminated when Parliament is in session. Big Ben\u2019s timekeeping is strictly regulated by a stack of coins placed on the huge pendulum. Big Ben has rarely stopped; even after a bomb destroyed the Commons chamber during the Second World War, the clock tower survived and Big Ben continued to strike the hours. The chimes of Big Ben were first broadcast by the BBC on 31 December 1923, a tradition that continues to this day. The Latin words under the clock face read DOMINE SALVAM FAC REGINAM NOSTRAM VICTORIAM PRIMAM, which means \u2018O Lord, keep safe our Queen Victoria the First\u2019. In June 2012 the House of Commons announced that the clock tower was to be renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s Diamond Jubilee.The Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in 1834. In 1844, it was decided the new buildings for the Houses of Parliament should include a tower and a clock. A massive bell was required and the first attempt (made by John Warner & Sons at Stockton-on-Tees) cracked irreparably. The metal was melted down and the bell recast in Whitechapel in 1858. Big Ben first rang across Westminster on 31 May 1859. A short time later, in September 1859, Big Ben cracked. A lighter hammer was fitted and the bell rotated to present an undamaged section to the hammer. This is the bell as we hear it today.The origin of the name Big Ben is not known, although two different theories exist. The first is that is was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, the first Commissioner of Works, a large man who was known affectionately in the house as \"Big Ben\". The second theory is that it was named after a heavyweight boxing champion at that time, Benjamin Caunt. Also known as \"Big Ben\", this nickname was commonly bestowed in society to anything that was the heaviest in its class.The Elizabeth Tower is not open to the general public although UK residents can arrange a visit by writing to their MP, but bear in mind there are 334 steps to climb. It is not possible for overseas visitors to tour the clock tower."

Anywhere you are in the area, having this in the background gives immediate recognition worldwide. We took pictures from across the Thames, from the boat dock by the tower, but probably our best photo was us next to one of their red phone booth with the tower in the background, two icons for the price of one! To get this shot, proceed across the bridge and walk passed the tower. Stay on the right side of the road. There is a park next to Pariament, on the right side is a phone booth. With this Location, you get your person, next to the booth, with the tower in the background, a great shot, best light is with the afternoon's sun on this side of tower. We exchanged taking pictures with other American college students at this spot."

But the highlight for me was seeing all the bells, it was particularly interesting to be standing next to the bells when it chimed. Obviously ear plugs were given out by the tour guide, who did a fabulous job of telling us all the various bits of the clock towers history.I still smile when walking over Westminster Bridge, knowing I had stood behind the clock face"

You have to sign a disclaimer, for health reasons, and the guide makes sure you realise what you are about to do. Firstly, we had to gather at Portcullis House where we were surched (airport style), and then lead to a waiting sight. We had to leave our handbags in a lock up as up as you are not allowed to take anything with you, not even your camera. They are very precise on timing. We where then lead through a tunnel and arrived at the Elizabeth Tower. We started to climb the steps quite quickley and after 114 of them you get a break and a sit down to catch your breath. while the guide explains the building of the tower etc. The next lot of stairs is quite something, but at a much slower pace, and stops on the way up. Eventually you get to see Big Ben. an amazing sight, and a little worrying as to how loud it is going to sound, but the guide has already given us ear plugs, and all is fine. To hear it is something realy special, so go on have a go, you'll not regret it."

One of the first things I discovered when I moved to London was all London residents can book a free tour of Elizabeth Tower (which houses Big Ben) by writing to their local member of parliament... After going on the waiting list I went on a tour in November and it was well worth the wait. You arrive at Portcullis house by Westminster tube station and go through security and get taken under the end of Westminster Bridge (this part was pretty cool) and get to see the cloisters around the end of the Houses of Parliament before climbing Elizabeth Tower. Our guide was really passionate and full of interesting anecdotes about the tower, the bell and its history. I won't spoil the trip but essentially you get to see behind the clock faces and the inner workings and eventually get to hear the bell being struck on the hour. You aren't allowed to take photos, which was actually quite nice as no one had their smartphones out at every corner. Make sure you wrap up warm if you're going during the winter months as it can get quite cold! Especially at the top! You have to be reasonably fit and healthy too as you have to climb hundreds of steps."

I did so a couple of years ago and it was amazing, although security is very tight and all belongings have to be left in Portcullis House and the visit has to be prearranged through your MP. It is well worth it though, there are three levels (you need a good strong heart) and at each stage a guide gives you an overview, we reached the very top and was there as the bell chimes for 5 O'clock - the feeling is almost surreal!"

It knocks you out with its size up close! Since then, every time I step out of the station, I always look up and remember my first time, it never ceases to amaze me. Architecturally beautiful and seen in every direction, you can't beat seeing it in every weather. My photo enclosed is on a rainy day in February 2016. As far as I'm aware, you can't go inside the bell tower unfortunately but that has never bothered me as I'd rather look at it rather than inside it!Thousands of tourists of course and there are also iconic red phone boxes all around with queues of people wanting a snap shot but the photos will look good with Big Ben in the background.Walk across the famous Westminster Bridge and then turn around and experience it in panorama view, a special sight to behold. I also enclose a photo from Westminster bridge, taken early morning in September. Enjoy this prestigious London landmark at your leisure."

While millions of people each year view the outside of the Elizabeth Tower, hundreds of people each month climb the 334 stone spiral steps to the top of the tower to hear Big Ben struck the hour. You also get a chance to see a spectacular view of London and see what goes on behind the clock dials. It is fascinating that the mechanics of the clock are still adjusted using old pre-decimal coinage. The tour is FREE - but there is a catch. Tours are usually booked up around 6 months in advance and one can only make a booking through a Member of Parliament. The set times are 9 AM, 11 AM and 2 PM Monday to Friday throughout the year and I believe there is a further tour at 4 PM from May to September. It may sound a hassle to get tickets, but I promise you it is well worth it. If you don\u2019t know the name of your MP, go on to the House of Commons\u2019 website and use their search facility. I am unsure whether there are facilities for overseas visitors to climb the stairs and see the actual bell that is Big Ben. I should warn you that the 334 steps are not for the fainthearted or those with a medical condition. There is no lift!"

Our 2 lady guides were excellent, both were knowledgeable, friendly and amusing. You do have to be relatively fit to climb the many stairs. Even though you climb in sections, it is still VERY hard on the legs, so be warned! We were fortunate enough to be inside the tower to watch the mid-day strike, so experienced the largest amount of bell strikes, which was very special too!You have to write to your local MP to be able to do this tour, but I would recommend and advise everyone that is able to, to do it - awesome!"

The down side is that you can't choose when you visit, you are just allocated a day and time slot. We're Londoners, so it was easy for us, but so worth doing. You climb over 300 steps to get to the bell tower, with stops along the way to catch your breath, but the view from up there has to be one of the best in London. Unfortunately no photography is allowed. Our guide was really friendly and very informative. We were there for the 10am strike which was something to see, hear and feel!

It is astonishing to think the bell, which weighs over 13 tonnes, was cast on 10th April 1858 and has been providing the background to London life ever since.In my view, hearing Big Ben makes any visit to London more memorable."

We would recommend visiting the area during spring and summer, with plenty of options to spend a fun-filled day. The London Eye, the Thames cruises, 10 Downing Street and Westminster are all a 5 minute walk away. The multi-cultural colourfully attired crowds that throng the bridge and the banks of the Thames would interest most observers. By the end of the day, weather permitting, you should have several great photos for your FB, memorable moments sprinkled with a glimpse of grandeur and surrounding splendour. When evening sets in, the lights of London provides another fantastic oppurtunity to get stunning photos and indulge in selfies. Finally, a walk to Piccadilly Circus should whisk up an appetite to indulge in the multi-cuisine delights available there."

Most people know that you can take tours of the Parliament building but that does not include going up the Elizabeth Tower to see the actual Big Ben bell.However UK residents can apply to their MP to be included on a tour. These are quite limited and the numbers are small but it is worth trying - it took about six months for my permit to come through.There are over 300 steps so you need to sign a disclaimer to say you are fit to tackle that. There is an extremely informative guide who gives more information in the two rooms on the way. When you reach the bells it is amazing and there is an incredible view of London. We arrived just before mid-day and equipped with ear defenders were able to watch the bells in full action. Better still, it's free.No photos because you have to leave cameras and phones at the start of the tour. Very tight security."

If you plan on using public transportation more than twice per day, buy an Oyster Card (not a Visitor Oyster Card) for 5 pounds, then add 6.40 pounds per day since this is the daily cap for unlimited public transit use in Zones 1-2 (these zones encompass almost all tourist sights like Big Ben, Buckingham, Kensington, London Eye, etc). The 5 pound deposit is refundable if you go to a counter at any tube station before returning home (otherwise you'll have to request a refund by mail)."

I exited looking for the giant symbol, not realizing to just look up lol It is a grand structure and very beautiful during the day or night time. I believe one can pay to go on a tour through it, however I was pressed for time and did not look into it thoroughly. The best picture is from the sidewalk heading down toward the river, which is where most get there shots. Overall, one cannot come to London and not visit this beautiful structure... take the time while there and see for yourself!"

Only for uk residents I believe which is a priveledge. Shame no photos permitted but it's quite refreshing really to be truly in the moment I guess. 334 spiral concrete steps were well constructed & no wear evident so felt safe but the metal inner hand rail while sturdy was a bit scarily low. Tim led our pacey tour and was very informative. We did stop at different levels on route so we didn't do all 334 in one go. Standing inside the clock faces was really somethings as was of course the chiming of Big Ben and the 4 other bells. Still can't believe it was free. I forgot how little clothes shopping there is in the area so turning up ultra early was a bit of a waste. I head back to Victoria station at a good pace and made it in 20mins.

Best viewed for photo from the opposite bank of the River - South Bank - either London Eye side or walk under the bridge and view straight on. A must for any tourist and very close to Westminster Abbey, Downing Street, Changing of the Guard, Trafalgar Square, Admiralty Arch, the Mall and the Palace."

The only thing to avoid is kid day there are tourists everywhere u can hardly walk. Annoying tourists with umbrellas and 5 kids who never left their country up until now that stop even though 100 people are behind them and cause traffic congestion on the pedestrian bridge. You have your people who constantly follow you around to take the photo you take. You have people cram into bars and pubs....go early, super early or go late. This crowd is ugly I never felt so crammed even I. NYC Times Square. Otherwise it's a great must see attraction."

For the majority of Londoners and visitors alike it is surely the 'Elizabeth Tower', the Clock Tower of the Palace of Westminster, which houses the great bell known as \"Big Ben\". The tower has only been known as the 'Elizabeth Tower' since 2012 to recognise the Diamond Jubilee (60 years reign) of Queen Elizabeth II but many people still refer to the actual tower as \"Big Ben\". We had arranged a guided tour of the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament) but the tour did not include visiting the interior of the 'Elizabeth Tower'. Nevertheless, it was really exciting to be standing so close to this most famous of landmarks. Our tour guide also gave some interesting information about the tower during the visit of the Houses of Parliament. What surprises many people is that the tower was only completed in the mid-19th Century following a major rebuild of the Palace of Westminster. It was built according to the plans of the architect Charles Barry and a neo-Gothic design by Augustus W. N. Pugin. In some respects, the views and opportunities for photographs are better when standing a little further away from the Palace of Westminster. The suggested locations to take photographs are either from Parliament Square, along Whitehall from Trafalgar Square, the Embankment or from Westminster Bridge.Views of the tower from any of these nearby locations are excellent. Listen to the chimes of \"Big Ben\" and you know you could only be in London!"

I learned that fact in a DVD about the history of measurement in the world. The fact that clock makers were able to create such accurate timekeeping instruments is a miracle in and of itself.Even from the outside, Big Ben is impressive. When you visit England, be sure to give yourself the chance to appreciate this piece of history, as I did on two occasions."

Weather does make a difference and this time it was pleasant and not too crowded. I am struck (no pun intended) each time I set my eyes on the wonderfully constructed building - so old, so intricate, so striking, so stately, so wise. The building seems to speak to me from the past and I truly love how it stands out without being arrogant or imposing. I couldn't help the sad thought that it was built from colonial wealth and from the suffering of so many who toiled under its oppressive hierarchy."

Plan your days ahead, there's a lot of other point if interest in the area (westminster abbey and all).I would recommend you to view the big ol' ben from the westminster bridge and across the bridge.

It was important to take the required ID etc. to be allowed on the tour. We were given a brief intro before starting our walk up the winding steps to the tower. The steps are in a winding spiral staircase but very manageable unless ill or infirm. Our guide (Christine I think) was very good and we had a welcome stop on the way up which included a sit down and a talk on some aspects of the history of the Tower. The talk was interesting and it was then up to the clock. It is quite strange to be on the inside of the clock faces. We then saw the clock mechanism before our final ascent to the bell tower. We were there at noon so had the full 12 bells (ear plugs were provided)! Although a mild day, it was quite windy so I would recommend keeping a jacket on for when you are slightly open to the elements. I do not like heights but there were no areas where I felt too uncomfortable, as there are no really exposed places, so don't let any fears put you off of having this experience. The tour lasts about 75 minutes and afterwards there were opportunities to use the loos and have a look at some of the art in Portcullis House"

As we climbed the stairs she was explaining everything about the tower and its history, approximately half way up we stopped for a well earned rest and sat whilst she spoke about Big Ben and its history, we were also given ear plugs for the 3pm chimes. We stopped again at the clocks and we could walk around and see the hands moving around the outside, Once at the top she gave us ample warning of when to plug our ears. Right on time Big Ben went into action. The views from the top although it was a cold day were stunning.Well worth a trip to the top, very educational and the female guide made it all the more interesting. We booked in advance for vetting, take two forms of id one being a photo id.Well worth the climb up and down!"

Lol ! When you are visiting London , make this the first place you visit ! Also the area is quite pricey as are all shops near tourist sites worldwide so buy drinks and snacks from supermarkets , ive seen a tin of coke sell for 1,60 which is extortionate , and exploits people not used to the currency or price of things (even 1,60 by London standards in a rip-off)"

I understand that you can actually purchase a tour to go inside the clock tower and see the actual bell that is \"Big Ben\", but I'm opted to get me history through reading, as I only had 4 days in London & many things to see & do. I.E. you can't see the same London from the top of a tour bus as you can see from a pod on the London Eye, so I'm going to get off the bus to do this.

Plus I do think that Big Ben does look nicer at night.My daughter wanted to see Big Ben as it is an iconic part of London. She stood looking up and was surprised when it chimed for quarter to six. I then had to explain why it does that. It doesn't take long but you can then go on to Westminster bridge and get a great view of London and parliament. We'll be going back as the aquarium and London Eye are calling us so we'll stop and check the time."

It's gorgeous when you can see the reflection from the buildings into the river. Given that it's right next to the London Eye, it's very convenient if you want to see both of those things."

We travelled by the tube from Paddington to Westminster Underground Station, on a Saturday morning with the primary intention of visiting Westminster Abbey.Before we headed for the Abbey, we fought our way through the massive crowds in the area, on to the Westminster Bridge. It was from this location that we thought that you could get some of the best angles for taking photographs of Big Ben. The real difficulty was actually in finding a clear spot on the bridge from whence you could take your photos. Any idea of having your companion appear in the photo, in the foreground, with Big Ben as a back-drop were soon forgotten. It was just impossible with the huge number of people on the bridge. We were astounded by the lengths that some people were willing to go to, to have their photos taken with Big Ben, in the background. Some risked their lives by standing and posing in the roadway section of the bridge whilst cars, buses and trucks sped past them.We simply made do with taking photos of this iconic landmark without anyone appearing in the photograph."

The clock is just as ornate, beautifully designed, and crafted.The sounds are just as huge -- ding, dong, ding, dong. Actually, it is more \"dong\" than \"ding\" because the decibels are low. You can hear them from afar. The bell strikes on the hour. If I am not mistaken, it strikes once every quarter hour too.Tourists flock to see this clock. Be ready for crowds. It is, however, a happy place because everyone is so very excited. Images of Big Ben on television, movies, and postcards come to life.When the British conquered other countries in the old days for the British Empire, they built replicas of Big Ben. I have seen copies of enormous clocks like Big Ben in parts of Asia that the British colonized. These clocks also dominate the cities with their sizes and sounds."

You could spend about 30 minutes to an hour here. Come early to avoid the crush on Westminster Bridge from fellow tourists taking photos. Or come in the evening for a different view. One vantage point is from the other side of the bridge....turn left for the London Eye or turn right to be right opposite the House of Commons....great for a shot of Big Ben, the House of Commons, the River Thames and Westminster Bridge all in one hit.TA doesn't let you select more than one group type, but basically anyone will enjoy it.

I don't know why I fell in love with it, but the architecture is beautiful, and it's incredible to see both in the day and the night, although I prefer admiring at night in its majestic lighting. I even cried a bit when it was time to leave London, which is definitely ridiculous and not all of you will do the same obviously. Maybe I love it because I can imagine Peter Pan flying above it or it's so huge and chimes every 15 minutes and London knows how to light up a monument, but whatever it is, it's clearly a must see and, for me at least, it deserves all the attention it gets and is not overrated."

Visits must be booked about 6 months in advance and you have to complete a security form online to be checked ahead of your visit. 2 types of ID are needed on the day, 1 photographic (passport/drivind licence) 1 paper (household bill/bank statement). I asked for 4 places on a tour. We were met in Portcullis House by 2 ladies from the visitor service, security checked and taken to the Elizabwth Tower. There are 334 steps but you stop twice on the way up and are seated for 2 very informative talks about the history of this iconic building. We stood inside the clock face and even watched Big Ben strike 3pm ( with ear plugs in ). This was a unique and very special experience. It was well worth the wait for our visit. Our guide Monika Rubens is both informative and entertaining, a real asset to the visitor service. After we descended the tower Monika very kindly took us into Westminster Palace, gave us a talk about its history and told us how to access the Houses of Commons and Lords. So my friends and I popped into both houses as they were in session. A brilliant day out."

It is disappointing that even exterior access to this iconic building is restricted and no effort is made to interpret or introduce the site to visitors. A dirty tunnel leads from Westminster tube station to some steps and dark iron railings through which glimpses of the tower can be had as well as a row of chained up bicycles at its base. Climb the dirty steps for a view the tower from the pavement, not a very good view or a convenient vantage point. The clock tower is purely for show, it is heritage orientated and draws lots if tourists, but there is nothing here when you arrive, it is all locked up, not even a guide book. It is more famous and iconic than interesting anyway, unless you like Victorian spiky buildings. It typifies the Gothic revival fashion of the mid 19C. Howver George Gilbert Scott's St. Pancras hotel, built in the 1870s, is much better, more restrained and less confusing to the eye. The clock tower was claimed by Charles Barry who designed the new houses of Parliament but was in fact designed by his 'assistant' Pugin (who also designed Alton Abbey, among many others, sadly now a badly maintained ruin in a theme park in Staffordshire).It is not to my taste but if you like the overwrought quasi-ecclesiastical Gothick revival style then this is the very place to come. Just don't ask for a guide book. "

The Elizabeth Tower (aka Big Ben, though this actually refers to the bell) is a punctuation mark for the beauty and stateliness of the Houses of Parliament complex. A masterpiece of ornate yet subtle decoration and gilding, it faces the Thames and backs up to Parliament Square and Westminster Abbey. With binoculars you might be able to read the script on the bottom of the clock face \"DOMINE SALVAM FAC REGINAM NOSTRAM VICTORIAM PRIMAM (Lord keep safe our queen Victoria I).\" Make sure to HEAR the Westminster Chimes at the hour and listen to the hours marked out by the bell whose unique sound was created by a crack soon after it was first sounded in 1859. The views the Elizabeth Tower from across the Thames or from above (in the London Eye) are inspiring, but a view down Whitehall from Trafalgar Square and the steps of the National Gallery is an unanticipated pleasure. Don't overlook the statue of Boadicea (Boudica) and her daughters across the street at the north end of Westminster Bridge. Queen of the Iceni and ancient British tribe, Boudica resisted the Romans and paid the price, but is commemorated on the plinth as their superior with the words of Wm Cowper, \"Regions Caesar never knew thy posterity shall sway.\""

And make sure you are there on one of the hours. It's impressive to hear the bell chime.Interestingly, it's now the leaning tower of Big Ben. Apparently, underground tube station work has caused the tower to start tilting to one side. It's 1.5 feet off vertical and noticeable to the eye."

Fantasic tour inside the tour finishing with seeing the big fella getting a few whacks at 3pm, great knowledge by guide and amazing to see the workings, there are over 300 narrow stairs so the tour isnt for everyone but if you get the chance to go the moment you realise you are behnd the clock face will stay with you forever - no photography allowed though, would have loved to have taken a pic behind the faces and the 'workings' and of course of the main attraction Big Ben."

Few thoughts:1) It's always busy 2) The view you get as you come out of Westminister Tube is the best one.3) If you cross the bridge (away from Big Ben) and turn right and down the steps, there are a few benches there which give you a great few of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.

Interesting info! Make sure to be around when it chimes."

Seeing it up close is far too cool to put into words. The architecture of this magestic monument is something to behold. It was definitely a highlight from our recent 4 day trip to London. For a unique experience, take the tube to Westminster station and exit the station at Westminster bridge. You come out at the foot of Big Ben and it really puts the incredible stature of this beautiful bell tower into perspective."

If you do then come just before the hourly strike to hear the chimes and also come late morning as you get more chimes! The problem with coming here is that Parliament Square is so busy with loads of traffic so I would suggest heading to the River embankment to take your photos or to the nearby bridge.There is nothng to see in Parliament Square itself but loads of things around it. You can visit the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Hall at certain times of year. There are so many tourist sttractions nearby that I could not list them all but would definitely walk through St James's Park or walk along the South Bank of the river towards the City - the walk to Tower Bridge is probably only an hour but is one of the most beautiful in London and there are loads of sights to see on the way.."

Would even have paid for an official photo - there's an money-making suggestion for them!The tour guide stopped us at various points on the climb and told us stories and facts about the tower that were fascinating. At the top we got to hear the 5pm chimes (ear plugs provided!) and it was honestly amazing. One of the most memorable moments for a long long time, and quite moving to boot - felt myself welling up.

I think there is also a paid for option at times.This is well worth doing, you not only get to see it but there is a guided tour as well which gives you lots of interesting snippets of info \u2013 like the time that someone working in the belfry was so shocked by the bell striking that he swore loudly \u2013 as the chimes were being broadcast live on Radio 4! I think now they only broadcast them live at times when there will be no-one working. For our visit we were supplied with ear plugs.

Elizabeth Tower and Big Ben are the most iconic aspects of the Palace of Westminster, although Westminster Hall and Jewel Tower have a much longer history.Big Ben refers to the Great Bell, of course, not the tower or the clock but most tourists call the whole tower Big Ben.You should try to be nearby when the Great Bell chimes 12 o'clock but this area is so noisy now that the best place to hear this is from a boat on the River Thames.The bell was cast at Whitechapel Bell Foundry east of the City of London on Whitechapel Road and that place hosts tours on Saturdays led by its owner, but advance booking is essential.From memory I believe that the original bell was cast in northern England but cracked so badly that it never took its place here. Even its recast replacement cracked because the original chiming hammer was too large, so it had to be repaired although the damage is still visible. This explains why the sound of its 'bongs' is slightly off-key.For the benefit of 14 September reviewer/s Andamy of Los Angeles, it isn't just a clock and the chimes are not just chimes, because this most recognisable London icon is officially the most popular landmark in the United Kingdom. It has also been named as the most iconic film location in London - it is very often seen in establishing shots.I see this many times during the year and will review again once I have taken a tour (when you have to ascend 334 steps to the belfry). Only UK nationals may take the tour, by contacting their Member of Parliament or a Member of the House of Lords. Be prepared to wait several months, though."

Anyone can apply to do this by writing to there local MP."

            "review": "What's in a name?. At the base of each dial is an inscription in Latin that means \"O Lord, keep safe our Queen Victoria the First\". Victoria was, until recently, the longest reigning monarch of the UK. Our present Queen has just taken the record from her. One of the Towers of The Palace of Westminster is named after Victoria, The clock tower is now named after Queen Elizabeth (since her Jubilee). These names seem appropriate. But, I guess is that the clock tower will continued to be known as Big Ben. The clock is renowned for its accuracy. The specification is that at the first stroke of the hour, it should mark the change of the hour within an accuracy of one second. The dial is unique in that the Roman Numeral for ten, X, is greatly distorted and embellished. The designer didn't like the letter X. Look closely at the dial and you'll easily see the unusual gothic type letter for ten. If anything can be called 'iconic', it is Big Ben. Visitors cannot get into the tower, except British citizens who are able to arrange, through their local Member of Parliament (MP) for groups of constituents to take the climb inside. If you plan to get close to the palace (Houses of Parliament) to see Big Ben, consider taking a walk over the Bridge and down the right hand side walking along the embankment a little (in front of the hospital). I think this is the best view of the palace and a fine view of the river. It's hard to credit that at one point in its history, the river was so polluted that the MPs complained about its sink when debating."

Many overseas visitors, and probably most UK residents, often refer to the Elizabeth Tower as Big Ben when in fact it\u2019s actually the nickname of the Great Bell housed within the tower. Its distinctive sound is the result of a repair to a crack in the bell back in the mid 19th century. No matter where in the world you may be, the sound of Big Ben is easily recognisable. The general public are not permitted in the tower, but it makes an excellent photo opportunity. As an iconic symbol of not just London but the whole of Britain, it is therefore a 'must-see'."

Three hundred and forty odd spiral stairs isn't for the faint hearted, don't look down, but when you're up and in it's amazing. Out in the belfry - the view is amazing of London, plus the of course centre of attention itself, Big Ben. We were up there for 11:00 when it struck. We were given ear plugs and advised to push them in. You're a bit sceptical I suppose and think 'it can't be that bad surely'... Put them in. Bell strikes, the whole tower shakes and the shockwave in the air from Big Ben is quite amazing, emotionally moving in a sense if you're into that kind of thing. Once done and dusted, the descent, again, don't look down. Amazing. It's a rare opportunity and a privilege to have as demand is so high. If you get the chance you won't be disappointed."

This stunning building is just so beautiful, from the elegant carving on the lower part to the ornate gilded decoration above the clock, especially when it glints in the sunlight. If you ever get the chance to climb the tower it's an experience never to be forgotten, from the clock room, to walking behind the huge dials and standing in the belfry when the bells chime, all with a tour guide explaining the history of the tower. You need to be a UK resident but as far as I can gather it's still a free tour but needs to be booked well in advance because it's extremely popular. Well worth looking into though."

We then stepped off into a side room where our guide gave us a few facts, and was more than happy to answer any questions. Then came the second lot of stairs. We were then stood right behind the Big Ben clock face, and were allowed to touch the glass. It's amazing to see and be told how this works, and on our further flight of stairs we went into the control room and saw all the cogs moving. A further few flights of steps took us right to the bell tower, with amazing views and watching the bell toll 10:00am was such an experience. I would recommend it to anyone!

Another of the \"must-see\" attractions in London, although there isn't much to do other than look at it and take pictures of it. What people usually think of as Big Ben is actually not officially called \"Big Ben\" -- a nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Westminster Palace, although it's often extended to refer to the clock and the clock tower. Officially, what people usually refer to as \"Big Ben\" is actually called the Elizabeth Tower.Just an interesting tidbit -- you should not use \"Big Ben\" to set your watch... A couple of days after we visited, the BBC pointed out that the chimes (heard every 15 minutes) had lately actually been as much as 6 seconds slow. After the report, mechanics corrected the clock to be within 2 seconds of the correct time (considered \"normal parameters\"), and will continue to do so when needed, by placing pennies on the pendulum or removing them to fine-tune its speed."

The highlight was standing behind the faces of the clock. As the other reviewer said you do have to go through your MP to book the tours, we had waited over a year as tried to tie in with the school holidays. There are two stops during the ascent but it is still relatively hard going. Although, I found the descent harder looking down all those steps can be quite dis-orientating. I can understand why they don't allow you to take photographs but as videos are readily available on the net it would have been nice if they allowed you to take one behind the clock or by big ben bell - just to show that you had done it. That said, really pleased that we did it and can't believe we were standing behind those famous clock faces."

To be honest, I never anticipated that I would be this fascinated with a clock and the Parliament. I thought the Eiffel Tower was going to do that. Nope, it was this, and it was absolutely mesmerizing.. The tour inside the Parliament was nice. The statues were gorgeous. I found this more interesting than the Eiffel Tower. Additionally, there is so much history in that building. Everything looked grand. The men with machine guns guarding the building were intimidating, but it did not take away from anything. The gift shop was high, which was expected. I will l warn visitors that Big Ben is not available to non-citizens of the U.K. I asked and was told this. Also, Big Ben is the bell, not the clock."

Big Ben itself is the large bell that chimes the hour and when the top of the hour approaches you will be invited to stand next to the bell with your fingers poised to stick in your ears as primitive volume control.

The sound of the bell chiming is iconic and recognised worldwide as a symbol of London and Britain.

It's a bit weird having to arrange it through your MP and you may have to wait a while - we were lucky and got the dates we wanted due to a cancellation but we spoke to someone else who had been waiting 2 years! Our tour guide Catherine was really knowledgeable and funny and her colleague Lindsey was really kind and friendly. We learnt about all the secrets of Big Ben being made, and looking out from behind the clock faces and seeing the bell being struck on the hour was amazing! The health and safety guidelines probably over-egg how hard it is. In fact the steps are really modern and all even, and there is a solid handrail throughout. You walk up very slowly and there are opportunities to rest on the way up and down. I don't think many people know you can do this (and you can only do it if you're a UK resident) so it felt like quite a privilege to do this!"

We walked along the Thames and it was a lovely walk taking everything in an then hopped on the tube. Next time though we said we would go to the other side of the river to take it all in properly."

Not quite the view you get from the London Eye, but this one is rather special as it is the home of the Great Bell and Clock that boom out at the beginning of some BBC radio news broadcasts. And it is also the highest part of the Palace of Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is an historic tower, but not one for the faint-hearted or sadly for anyone of limited mobility as there is no lift and every visitor must climb the several hundred stairs to reach the clock and bell chamber. You will pass the cell where any troublemakers around Parliament could(can) be held to cool their heels and tempers, but the real supreme moment of the visit is the clock and the great bell. If you happen to be there at the turn of the hour, you get the special excitement of the deafening chimes from the bell. A daunting climb it is , but well worth the energy to get up - and coming down is much easier."

It is however the outside that people will remember, and a good spot for a photograph is about half way across Westminster Bridge."

It also seems much more impressive if you're standing right below it when it rings on the hour! We went when the sun was setting (about 9pm) as well, at which point it was extremely beautiful and the crowds also have dissipated for the most part. I'd recommend this for getting better photos that won't have a ton of other people in them if you so desire."

Nothing expresses that you are in London like a photo posed on Westminster Bridge with the Tower in the background and a double decker bus or black cab rolling by."

But after sending an email to their office my MP's really efficient PA replied within minutes (i the evening) and I soon had a booking.It's quite a climb up the tower, but there are stopoff points to rest. You get behind the iconic clock faces, get to the clockwork mechanism, and up to the bells. You get ear plugs and stand right next to Big Ben as it rings out, and you really feel the vibrations in the stonework. The views are terrific out the balustrades, and when you're back on the ground you can look up and see exactly where you were, near the top of this World icon. Definitely recommended."

I was alarmed immediately but we had nothing loose that could be taken from us easily so we were fine. But since I found it very suspicious we went a little further and looked back at the scene where we saw them repeat their little game a couple of time.So just be careful in the area."

When my relatives from India came in Britain, they went to London and after a brief tour, we went to see Big Ben, the most iconic clock tower in the Houses of Parliament. The best way to go is by London Underground and get off at Westminster Station on the District, Circle and Jubilee Line, because when you come out of the station Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament is right there in front of you. Not only can't you miss it but the position is also good for any photo opportunities. We also stayed around the area for a few minutes but there is a souvenir shack nearby and it is only a short walk to Westminister Abbey, another well known iconic place in London. Much of the restaurants and takeaways are further up north to where Big Ben is located, so it is best to take a pack lunch or eat before you go and visit. Because it is most popular, expect a lot of people both local and foreign to be all over the place. Apart from that, Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament are a great place to see both day and night and no holiday in England would be complete without seeing them, so if you have time to spend even for a few minutes, this place is well worth a visit."

The Big Ben is one of those spots in London that you cannot avoid seen if you visit the city for the first time.My mother was visiting the city for the first time, so my husband and I decided to do a tour for the main attractions. The tower clock was commissioned after a fire at the Westminster Palace in 1834. It started working in 1859 and became a symbol of London.Because of that and because there are other important attractions nearby, like the Houses of Parliament and the Westminster Abbey, this area is full of tourists and not easy to navigate. Prepare yourself for that."

Taking pictures is enough for me but for those who would like to climb to the top of the Big Ben you will need to pay \u00a318 if I am not wrong. It is attached to The Parliament Building just besides the famous Thames River. Now it is known as Elizabeth Tower for celebrating the Diamond Jubilee for the Queen. Previously it is just called Clock Tower but most people call it the Big Ben. Besides the Big Ben there is some other beautiful gothic building around so take as many picture you can from different angle."

If you are a UK resident you can request a tour of the Elizabeth tower - be warned there is about a six month waiting list.But, its well worth the wait - Really Amazing! 334 steps take you to touching distance of Big Ben (the bell) in the bell tower over 90meters up above the London streets.Fortunately you don't climb all the steps in one go - you have two pauses where your host will tell you something about the tower and its history.For me the highlight was in the mechanism room, watching the cogs and pendulum move whilst the clock chimed a quarter, but being in the bell tower whilst the clock struck 12, and seeing the huge clock faces from behind was pretty amazing too.No photos are allowed at all - but you will remember your visit anyway.Seriously enjoyable and not to be missed. Huge thanks to our tour guides Monica & Phil."

I must say there are loads and loads of tourists and the streets are very busy. For my tip, try walking towards westminster abbey, less people but the angles for photos are also superb."

I couldnt wait to see it in person after seeing it on television and it books so many times but I found it quite underwhelming if I'm honest. It is literally just a tower and I didn't find it to be particularly special even if the architecture is good. I would recommend it for a quick picture if you are in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way just to see it in person if you are staying outside the city."

The $5 BP Oyster card + preload fares (aka top up) is way to expensive comparing to other European countries day pass or pay as you go fair.

Also, you can see it in a lovely light at sunset, the red and orange lighting on it gives it a wonderful perspective. You can take some beautiful photos of it also from the city bus and, because there is an airport nearby, many nice shots with airplanes can be taken.

Instructions where given an away the tour started. Very enjoyable, had about three stops during the tour with lots of information given, would recommend. You can take water with you, you are not allowed to take photo's during the tour. We were there for 12ish to hear the Big Ben chime, had a good view of the sights of London from the bell tower. Our guide was very knowledgeable but seemed to have a speech impediment making it slightly hard to understand. There is a shop but this is not at the entrance to access the shop you need to come out of the entrance and turn left and left again and it is at the end of the building on the corner undercover (not very signposted). No toilets at venue you have to use the ones at the underground."

            "review": "Big Ben (http://www.bigbenfacts.co.uk/history/index.html). The illustrations on this page were created by students at St. George's Primary School in Camberwell, London, as part of our \"Happy Birthday, Big Ben!\" project. These illustrations were previously published in a booklet about the history of Big Ben.On 16th October 1834, the Palace of Westminster was destroyed by a fire. A HUGE fire. Londoners came out to watch it, and legend has it, Charles Barry (whom we\u2019ll meet in a moment) was passing by in a coach and stopped to watch for a while.There were so many spectators, they actually hampered the firemen\u2019s efforts to douse the flames.When the flames were put out, there wasn\u2019t much left. Only Westminster Hall. Parliament had nowhere to meet and they had to cancel their session.In November 1835, 13 months later, they set up a committee to re-build and they held a competition for designs.More than 400 designs were submitted by more than 90 architects.In the end, the committee chose the design of Charles Barry, but here's a little secret: His original design did NOT include a clock tower! They asked him to revise it and to add a clock tower, of course with a clock inside!Working with his trusty (but somewhat highly strung) assistant, Augustus Welby Pugin, Charles Barry added a clock tower to his design, along with four faces, and really big bells!But Charles Barry, quite rightly, asserted that HE was an architect, not a clockmaker. So he asked Benjamin Lous Vuillamy, clockmaker to the Queen, to design a clock.By this time, it was 1841, so you can\u2019t blame Charlie for wanting to get on with his project. However\u2026.ALL the expert clockmakers across Britain were upset that he had asked Benjamin Louis Vuillamy to design the clock, without so much as an open competition.One clockmaker, Edward Dent, wrote to George Airy, Astonomer Royal, asking him to recommend him for the job. Of course, George Airy did so, and, as a result, the committee decided that George Airy should write up a list of requirements for the Great Clock. They asked him to choose the design and the clockmaker to boot!George Airy was really excited about his job, and he wrote up a list of requirements that had never been seen before. It was a long list, but the most important requirement was this:\"The Great Clock should be so accurate that the first strike for each hour shall be accurate to within ONE second of time.\"Whew! Nobody had EVER required a clock to be that accurate. Much less a clock in a CLOCK TOWER, with FOUR HUGE FACES, and such LARGE HANDS!The expert clockmakers stopped grumbling and started whinging. They felt George Airy's specification was IMPOSSIBLE! They thought it could never be done.One man thought it was worth a try. His name was Edmund Beckett Denison (who later became Lord Grimthorpe). He was a cantankerous sort of fellow \u2013 a persistent, single-minded kind of chap who didn't take \"no\" for an answer.Here\u2019s my favourite part of the story: Edmund Beckett Denison wasn't even a clockmaker! He was a lawyer! Clockmaking was his HOBBY.So here\u2019s this AMATEUR (albeit a very intelligent amateur), telling all the EXPERTS, \"Yes, it can be done.\"Edmund Beckett Denison set his mind to the task. Perhaps CANTANKEROUSNESS has its benefits.He worked with Edward Dent, the clockmaker, to design the clock which would become the Great Clock in the clock tower at the Palace of Westminster.The key to the Great Clock of Westminster is the ESCAPEMENT. In fact the key to ANY turret clock is the ESCAPEMENT. The ESCAPEMENT is the part which regulates the going train of the clock, and allows the energy to escape to the pendulum. Without an ESCAPEMENT, a wound clock would unwind uncontrollably. In this case, Edmund Beckett Denison designed a \"double three-legged gravity escapement.\" The escapement works with the pendulum; each swing of the pendulum opens one of the gravity arms, which in turn regulates the GOING TRAIN.Well, all that time, while the clockmakers were grumbling and then whinging and then jealously watching Edmund Denison and Edward Dent achieve the impossible, the clocktower had been under construction.And the Illustrated London News had been following the story like stickiness on marmalade:\"The history of this already famed Clock dates as far back as 1844.... The escapement used by Mr. Denison is a remontoir, or gravity escapement, being more independent of the causes of vibration for the position this clock will occupy.\"(You can read the WHOLE STORY as reported by the Illustrated London News on the page called BIG BEN's STORY.)Of course, the Great Clock needed bells. Big bells. One bell for the hour, plus four bells to chime the quarter hours. They wanted the bells to chime a tune based on an aria from Handel\u2019s Messiah. It's the famous \"Westminster Chime\" that you hear just before Big Ben strikes the hour.So they asked foundries to submit a cost for casting all those bells, and Warners of Cripplegate won the contract.The first bell cracks!They cast all five bells. The big one was cast on 6th August 1856, in Stockton-on-Tees. It was transported to London on a steamship, because the bell was too big for the railway. It came up the River Thames on a barge, and then was loaded onto a carriage drawn by 16 white horses and brought across Westminster Bridge.It must have been quite a sight \u2013 all those horses! Wouldn't you HATE to have to clean up after that!The clock tower wasn\u2019t quite finished, so they hung the massive bell in the yard and every so often, they\u2019d hit it with a hammer to test it.The Big Bell was SUPPOSED to be called \"Victoria\", after the Queen, but Londoners being Londoners, they nicknamed it \"Big Ben\" and the name stuck.There are two theories who \u201cBen\u201d was. One was Benjamin Caunt, a bareknuckle boxer, and the other was Sir Benjamin Hall, who was the Commissioner of Works during the construction of the new Palace of Westminster.Now, where were we? Of course, we were hitting the bell with a hammer to test it.Wouldn\u2019t you know it? On 17th October 1857, the bell cracked!You can imagine the controversy, with Edmund Beckett Denison pointing his cantankerous finger at Warners and Warners pointing their grimy fingers at the guy who held the hammer and the Illustrated London News pointing their journalistic fingers at EVERYBODY.Big Ben is deliveredThey broke up the bell \u2013 smashed it into a lot of tiny pieces \u2013 and hauled them over to Whitechapel Bell Foundry where, on 10th April 1858, they cast a new Big Ben. A bit smaller this time, a mere 13 and a half tons, it took the second Big Ben TWO weeks to cool down! They tuned him and finished him and when he was ready, they put him on a cart and hauled him back to Westminster. Londoners cheered him all along the way.Guess what! The clock tower was STILL NOT FINISHED. And when they did finish, they discovered that Big Ben was too big to fit up the shaft into the belfry. The bell is wider than it is tall. What a mess!Fortunately, someone figured out that they could turn him on his side, put him in a cradle and pull him by rope up to the belfry. It took a team of men THIRTY hours to get that job done.With all the bells in place, they installed the Great Clock, and it started working in May 1859. And on 11th July 1859, Big Ben chimed the hour for the first time. At last!But our story does not end there. On 1st October 1859, disaster struck! Big Ben was cracked by the hammer strike, and they couldn't move him out of the belfry. After all, the Great Clock had been installed below the belfry. So to remove Big Ben, they would have had to remove the Great Clock and ALL the mechanisms.So Big Ben was silent for a number of months while the arguments ensued. Yet again, there was A LOT of finger pointing and blaming each other. Edmund Beckett Denison thought that Whitechapel Bell Foundry had cast an inferior bell, and Whitechapel Bell Foundry thought that Edmund Beckett Denison had designed a hammer that was too large and well, there was A LOT of finger pointing.Ultimately, George Airy came up with a solution: Turn Big Ben a quarter turn, so that the hammer will strike a different spot. And that's just what they did - turned Big Ben so that the hammer strikes a different spot. Even today, when you visit the belfry, you can see the big crack in Big Ben. We think it adds to his charm!Our story does not have an ending, because Big Ben and the Great Clock are hard at work every single day. Even now!They\u2019ve marked time throughout the reigns of 6 monarchs, the tenure of 25 prime ministers and the visits of countless tourists who show up at Westminster just to admire Augustus Pugin\u2019s fantastic decorations and to hear Big Ben chime the hour."

It was built in 1858, and it's simply amazing to me that it was transported by horse and carriage a few miles and then over the London Bridge-being that it weighs over 3 and a half tons. So when you go to London and see both the Big Ben and the London Bridge, imagine what it would have looked like in 1858."

In the same premises, you can see statues of leaders of Mahathma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Churchill and Abraham Lincoln. Walk few 100 metres to view West Minister Abbey. There is another building nearby - which I guess is Dean's yard and it is also very beautiful. Downing Street then to Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square can be reached by walk. You also get good views of Big Ben from London Eye and Trafalgar Square or National Gallery. During the New year celebration, this is the place above which world famous fireworks happen. Nearest station Westminister. If you walk down across the Westminister bridge towards London Eye, you will have lot of eateries."

Both the good and the bad here is that it's exactly what you expect, and have seen on countless photographs of London. There is little more to add in terms of what it is, looks like, etc.One real tip though: come in the afternoon. You will want to take pictures for sure, and there is one direction where you can stand and take pictures: the western direction. In the morning, when the sun is in the East, your pictures won't come out very well. That or you will need to squeeze into the sidewalk next to the bridge and take a picture near an iron fence."

Is very interesting to walk around and look at the facility and the sheer size of it. Is usually very crowded with sightseers and traffic is very busy around, so need to be careful and watch for people and cars, is best during nice weather, as you can roam around and see more."

Apply to your MP and join the waiting list, it's free and only UK people get to do it, go - you won't regret it (but your legs will!!).

I love Big Ben ( I know that's the bell name ) but we all know it as BIG BEN the whole tower ) I got in touch with my local MP ( member of parliament by email ) as that is the only way u can go up the 100 odd stairs inside the tower. Restricted access and wait to get a slot if your lucky , named address place of birth has to be pre notified fir security reasons of course As if it was open to the general public daily it would damage the stairs etc . Standing next to the giant glass four sided clock glass was amazing . The big hand of the clock is as long as a London Red bus . Interesting your guide . Re the history of the clock and its mechanics over the years . They still put a couple of old big Penny coins on the time keeping part , to get the correct exact time . The high light for me was at 11am we stood right next the the main big bell ( Big Ben and the smaller bells ) I held on to an iron girder as I wanted to feel the vibration AND hear the lovely big bell(s) strike 11 dongs . DOUBLE thrill . Amazing ! But to my surprise it didn't sound as LOUD as I thought . And I was two feet from the bells . As the famous sound of the bells you hear from outside in the streets sounds lovely and loud with that deep base sound . It still takes my breath away , and I was born 1/2 mile from Big Ben and grew up 2/3 miles away and if the wind blows our way on a late quiet nite we hear the bells in the distant . But busy mega London of last 10 years since May 2004 , re street noise . Extra buildings and a million or so extra people now living in London ( 10 million ? living in London now omg ) We don't get to hear the bells in the distance so much . Unless we walk 15 mins . I often do as I just love Big Ben strike its glorious bell(s) Also not far to walk to the London eye / Big wheel and touristy South bank area . So a good visit of that area all within walking distance too . It's Massive In sight and sound main bell Big Ben bellIt's my fave view in London is Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey . This is the icon of London in my book . .... Not the \"modern \" Shard or Gherkin , they are nice ....but modern is not really my thing . Good if you like modern architecture of course . I personally love old London sites / old London sky line .From a Londoner age 44 / a young at heart 44 lol "

Some say it is after Benjamin Caunt, a famous Heavyweight boxer but most agree it is after Sir Benjamin Hall who, as the first Commissioner of Works, oversaw the installation of the bell.This does seem likely as his name is inscribed on it. The bell is over 7 feet tall and over 9 feet wide. It was cast in 1858 at Whitechapel Bell Foundry (which I am due to visit and review soon) and weighs over 13 tons. It replaced an ill-fated earlier bell cast in Stockton-On-Tees which cracked beyond repair during testing.I saw the tower and clock from the front top deck of a routemaster bus yesterday evening and it is tastefully lit at that time of day. I was also close up to it during a recent private visit to the Palace of Westminster. British citizens, after applying through their Member of Parliament and waiting patiently for several months, may take a tour involving the climb to the top of the tower to see the bells and the interior and workings of the clocks."

One of the best things about central London is that one can walk around an entire day and just see and appreciate an infinite amount of historical architecture juxtapositioned with contemporary culture. With Big Ben one can get up close to the fence of the Houses of Parlement + appreciate the scale and intricate detail of this icon of the London cityscape, and a walk accross Westminster bridge will give you great views back accross the water of the entire Houses of P complex."

            "review": "You \"have to do\" this one but you need to look around carefully to make it worth the trip. Big Ben is actually the bell at the top of the tower so you can't see it, but you can see the Elizabeth tower named after our beloved queen. The Palace of Westminster itself is an Iconic building, photographed from every angle and when you see it yourself it will look familiar for sure and maybe a bit disappointing as you already know it. BUT don't give up yet, like all of London, there are hidden gems waiting to reward the detective tourist. Walking over Westminster bridge to the South bank of the river Thames is worth it for the different view. Better is to try walking to the right hand end of the Palace of Westminster (where the Lords do their Lording over the rest of us) where you will find the Victoria Tower gardens. This pretty little park contains some amazing statues from the British past. There's the Slave Memorial (the Brits started and ended the slave trade) and the statue of Emmeline Pankhurst leader of the Suffragettes movement which secured the right to vote for women. Or the statue by Rodin of the Burghers of Calais. What a story, around 1347 it is said that England's King Edward III, after a victory at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy, besieged the port of Calais in France, Philip, the King of France, ordered the city to hold out at all costs. He then failed to lift the siege, and starvation eventually forced the city to beg for surrender or die.King Edward offered to spare the people of the city if any six of its top leaders would surrender themselves to him to be executed. He demanded that they walk out wearing nooses around their necks, and carrying the keys to the city and castle and 6 of them actually did it - would anyone do that today I wonder... It was this moment, and this poignant mix of defeat, heroic self-sacrifice, and willingness to face imminent death that Rodin captured in his sculpture. By the way, there are other casts of this same scene - would be a great project to research all of them. . .Right in front of the Palace of Westminster is another green space called Parliament Square and if you can brave the traffic to get over there you will find more interesting statues from the history of Britain. Look out for the big man with the walking stick - accompanying him you will also find Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Ghandi, Jan Smuts (father of South Africa) and many more characters from British history whose names we honour and remember for their contribution to our country.Located at the start of Westminster bridge, over the road from the bell tower, ladies shouldn't miss the 1850s bronze sculpture commemorating Queen Boudicca (also known as Boadicea), queen of the British tribe known as the Iceni, who led a savage but unsuccessful revolt against the Romans in AD 60-61. An interesting local legend has it that Boudicca is buried beneath platform 10 at King's Cross Station - right next to that other famous platform there . . . .Note also in this area the beautiful Westminster Abbey where you will find the tombs of the Kings and Queens of England - how small they were. Look also for Poet's Corner featuring Robert Burns, Lord Byron, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, T. S. Eliot, Thomas Gray, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Samuel Johnson, John Keats, Rudyard Kipling, Jenny Lind, John Masefield, John Milton, Laurence Olivier, Alexander Pope, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Thomas Shadwell, William Shakespeare, Alfred Lord Tennyson and William Wordsworth to name most of them!Take a quiet moment here to imagine over a thousand years of history flowing around this place.If you have energy left then walk along Whitehall to Trafalgar Square and eat in the outstanding National Gallery. What a great day this is."

Background checks are required, and there is quite a bit of security before the tour starts. Our tour guide was very enthusiastic, and the tour was well staged to allow a gradual level by level rise towards the clock at the top. The tour culminated in us surrounding the Big Ben bell itself as it was struck at 5pm (earplugs were provided!). Well worth the organisation - write or email your UK MP to get on the waiting list."

The clock actually works each face individually despite the fact the time faces are all ways correct to the centimetre, the timing used to be with old one penny coins , with a 24 hour watchmen ,who used to sit in the face room of the tower, with ear defenders for the Bell LOL."

Only about 10 people go with you and guide. You will be told whole history and how big Ben works. You will even see and hear it from the inside. My favourite part was to touch number 6 and now i can show off by telling people i touched it whilst they didn't even know it's possible. However, i didn't like steps to the top and i am not complaining that there isn't lift but stairs are so plain that if i didn't know where I am then i would think that I'm climbing some council tower block.

The Clock Tower is officially known as the Elizabeth Tower, renamed in 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The tower holds the second largest four-faced chiming clock in the world and was completed in 1858. Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament set scenically along the Thames River.

Although it's a long way up the guide stops regularly on the different levels to give information about the tower etc. No photography. Cameras and loose objects are all placed in lockers as if an object were dropped it could kill someone lower down the stairway. I would recommend.

Right at 5:00 pm and Big Ben rang out the hours...Although Big Ben is the misnomer given to this tower by most...it is actually The Elizabeth Tower, the famous tower of Parliament. Big Ben is actually the nickname of the bell housed within the Elizabeth Tower - and Big Ben's official name is the Great Bell.Anyway, get there and see Westminster Abbey, the House of Commons, Palace of Westminster and even glimpse the London Eye from Westminster Bridge.

The area is a bit crowded but very safe, festive neighborhood. There is a spot that is suppose to be the most popular photo taking spot near Big Ben and that is by a single red, traditional London phone booth. I was told it's the most photographed phone booth in London because you get a great shot of the phone booth and Big Ben in one shot. Sadly, this was pointed out to us after our visit, by a double decker tour bus operator. Nevertheless, we got wonderful photos of this glorious monument.

Try to visit it both during the day and nighttime"

HahaThe clock inside the tower was the world's largest, because it was installed in the middle of the nineteenth century and is still the largest in Great-Britain. Unfortunately the clock tower is not publicly accessible. However, If you're looking for views over London, the London Eye, the Shard or the Monument are currently the best options.

Even if you don't go inside the Houses of Parliament, you have to view them externally and hear Big Ben mark the hours (and the quarters) with its deep resonant tones.Once you've taken your compulsory photographs, cross the road and settle down with a \"pint\" in the front bar of St Stephen's Tavern. This is the pub traditionally associated with the House of Commons and has lots of interesting pictures and memorabilia. They still have the Division Bell used to warn MPs that they have just a few minutes to scurry back across the road to vote on important matters!You can't avoid hearing Big Ben as it's only across the road. And it's a much more comfortable and relaxing way of listening to the bells. And there's so much more to see within a stone's-throw of BB. Westminster Abbey, 10 Downing Street, Horse Guards Parade, Churchill's War Rooms and many many more. Head for Westminster Station on the Tube and you're there. Help yourself to a large portion of (mainly free) British history!"

I was worried about all the steps, but they break it up, and you stop at the different levels on the way up, so you don't feel too tired or dizzy from the spiral stairs. The whole tour was excellent and I would highly recommend. Please note these tours can only be arranged through your MP and you do have to be security checked and cleared before you come so you can't just book at short notice.

I will tell you something different. Read this review though & I will tell how to climb the 334 steps to the top for free. 1) You have to be a UK resident 2) ID confirming your name & address 3) Fit & healthy 4) Age over 11 Then all you need to do is write a letter to your local MP. You will get letter & confirmation back to you in the post from your MP. There is approx a 6month wait as they take 3 groups per day to the top in groups of 16. It is not a difficult climb. It is taken at a good pace with regular stops. Where you get given info on the history & building of the tower. You reach the top timed so that you are in the bell tower to hear the chimes. You walk behind each clock face. All in all an awesome experience. Give it a go. I will never forget this experience."

The clock tower, which is the worlds most famous clock, is nicked named Big Ben because of the bell. It's still is worth a look as it's the most important part of English representation. A symbol of time and one seen each year to welcome in the new year.It has four faces and to get the full effect go see it at 11:45am and wait till 12:15.Not only do you see it and Parliament in all it's glory from the outside but you will hear the chimes.The sound created by the cracked bell is unique and warms the heart.This chimes you will hear are the sound of time. The architecture is pure fantasy rolled into the world of politics and law of the lands.Even at night she stand lit up like a Time Lady and is worth a view in the dark from the south bank.A must see."

Phones and cameras are not allowed in the tower. Our guide was great, really knowledgable and amusing, there are a lot of stairs, but broken into 3 levels with a stop and things to see on each level. You see the workings of the clock and at the top walk around the 4 faces of the clock. An amazing feeling! The tour is timed so you experience Big Ben chiming the hour.

Big Ben is actually the largest bell inside the clock at the top of St Stephens Tower which is attached to the buildings normally referred to as The Houses of Parliament. This isn't a lecture so, in a nutshell, you can't ordinarily see Big Ben per se but you can see the clock faces just fine; you can hear the chimes on the hour for the 'bongs' ;and the phrases for each of the quarter hours too. All pretty much as heard on BBC TV and radio for 1800 and 2400 hours local. Big Ben and the tower do not lie on the Greenwich meridian line which is perhaps five miles to the East, from which absolute time is taken, and so Big Ben probably sounds microseconds later. Like I say, this is an essence of the story for a bit of fun and is not a lecture. A charming victorian building, an iconic centrepiece for London and a bit of photography to say that \"I was there.' Shouldn't take long to see it, and arguably best viewed from one of the river buses most of which call in at nearby Westminster pier."

We were warned in advance to wear comfortable shoes (essential) and that there were many steps, but the climb was broken into stages with a rest after each stage while information was given. Seeing the clock-hands from inside the tower and standing about a foot away from Big Ben when it chimed (with earplugs!) were amazing experiences."

Very disappointing, though, that only English citizens can tour the clock - can't they open it to anyone from the Commonwealth?"

More important it add values to surrounded places. Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London and often extended to refer to the clock and the clock towerThe tower is officially known as the Elizabeth Tower, renamed as such to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II (prior to being renamed in 2012 it was known as simply \"Clock Tower\"). The tower holds the largest four-faced chiming clock in the world and is the third-tallest free-standing clock tower. The tower was completed in 1858. The tower has become one of the most prominent symbols of the United Kingdom and is often in the establishing shot of films set in London."

Even tho I've been to London sightseeing before (self-guided), I never realised until I was on a guided bike tour which took us on the south side of the river, that the usual view you see of Big Ben on TV is from the south bank of the river, with the Houses of Parliament to its left. So, walk across Westminster Bridge and along the bank a bit, and you'll get the best view of Big Ben to photograph. We also got another good view by accident one evening of Big Ben and Parliament all lit up by night as we travelled by a standard red double-decker bus from near the Imperial War Museum to Trafalgar Square (only about 1.50 per ride) which goes across Westminster Bridge as part of its usual route."

BB is located opposite Westminister Abbey near Westminster tube station and Westminster pier. The sound emanating from the clock when it chimes cannot be forgotten. A deep, powerful BONG sound. The general area around the Houses of Parliament, the Abbey and the adjoining park is very photogenic. There is usually a demonstration opposite the entrance to the Parliament, photographers capturing the drama and a crowd going through the area. Lots to see, lots of atmosphere and of course, the wonderful chimes of Big Ben every 30 minutes. And ... to it is all free. On two previous visits to London, I entered Parliament for Question Time and stood under Big Ben on New Year's Eve. This tiny spot in London has many memories of previous visits."

I managed to book for a group of 16 and for an 11 start meaning we got the full 12 'bongs' - worth waiting a few months for. It is important to note that only people with UK passports or who are resident here can go and you have to apply via your MP. You can go on your own or any number up to16. The main leader/tour guide was truly inspirational - there are over 300 steps but you do it in 100s, with a stop for a chat and to look at the mechanism on the way. Finally reaching the top with an extraordinary view of London from inside the bell tower and to be there as it strikes 12 is just too good to be true. But the real icing on the cake is to then go inside the clock face and walk round the inside - just like in the 39 Steps!!And it is free!! A must for any Londoner, visitor to London from the rest of the country or to anyone fortunate to be resident here."

If you really want to experience the whole experience of Big Ben - then a tour of the tower itself (Elizabeth Tower), is a must and the only way this can be done is via your local MP - there is no charge - but at least a 6-9 month wait to get onto the tour itself. Open to British citizens and a security clearance. You climb the 354 steps on the spiral staircase inside right to the top of the tower. You must be fit and able to make the climb. Then to stand behind the clock face/s and then the last final steps on up to the final level to the home of \"big ben\" - you are up close to when the big Ben and when the bell chimes. Views out from this level are really fabulous. You see the mechanical workings and how the whole bell system works - all very interesting. The tour guide was so informative with history etc., and it was an amazing experience and well worth the wait to go. So glad we have visited."

Anyone who is a resident in Britain can request to climb the 334 of the Elizabeth Tower via their MP, and it is free! It was an experience from the time we arrived at Prospect House, where we went through airport style security, then waited for our tour to start. There was 12 of us on the tour. We went underground to get to the Elizabeth Tower (so called after our Queen), there are 3 or 4 stops on the way up the stairs, we stood behind the four clock faces of Big Ben, then climbed further to where the bell called 'Big Ben' hung, we got there for the 12 midday bongs. The climb and the talk were fascinating, our guide had an amazing amount of knowledge regarding Big Ben, and the Elizabeth Tower. This is a day that will always stay with me. I found the walk up relatively easy as there were a few stops, however I had to concentrate when coming down, not quite sure why! I strongly recommend that you all write to your M. P's to get your free tickets to walk up."

Watch out for pickpockets. We had a couple of individuals masked like clowns approached our son in a group. They placed their hands over his shoulder, shook his hand whilst the others tried to pat for mobile phone and wallet. Fortunately our son was really alert. Since they are masked, London Police will not be able to help due to inability to identify the criminals. There is also illegal betting and gambling on the pedestrian pavements. Do not join in the game as these are criminal syndicates. Do not be carried away by what you are doing. Be alert ! London has changed much since our last visit 15 years ago. It is now more colourful and demographically different but also complicated and confusing. After the visit to the Parliament and the Big ben, travellers can walk towards the Buckingham Palace and even as far as Knightsbridge."

Then either keep sitting there or start walking the southern embankment as it twists and turns east toward tower bridge, or stroll the other way, west of Lambeth bridge, to a great barge bar called Tamesis Dock."

Access is under the road and of course there are steps 200 or so. There is an age limit too which I think is 12. First you go so far up and stop at a room where the guide gives you information about the history of the tower, the bell and the clock. Then you go up to the clock mechanism which is fascinating. The pendulum is weighted with old pennies. Then it's up behind the clock face to the bell. The tour is timed so that you reach here on the hour. Earplugs are provided. This is the best tour in London. The two ladies who acted as guides last time I went were great. You can also go into Westminster Hall and see where Guy Fawkes and William Wallace were tried."

Remember you can't see Big Ben from the street because Ben is not the building, but the large bell inside. Some of you didn't know that I bet...Anyway, London's a great place to walk around in nice weather, but even if it's a bit cold and rainy it's still surprisingly enjoyable...

Getting tickets is a bit of a job, as you have to be 'invited' by your MP or Member of the House of Lords, and that can take some time to sort, but it's worth the hassle, and it's free to go up! The climb is done in 3 or 4 stages, with a rest to view different areas of the tower, and standing watching the clock mechanism and being behind the clock faces makes you forget all the stairs! We got into the belfry at 4.55pm, so just enough time to put the earplugs in, and then off it goes!A fantastic opportunity to visit one of the worlds best known landmarks, and the whole trip takes around 90 minutes, so not too rushed.

You need to book well in advance (months) by contacting your MP and your choice of dates may be limited. At the time we visited it was free, but I think I heard there are plans to charge in the future? You have to be a UK citizen and security checks will be done both before you visit and on arrival. I almost don't want to say too much, because I don't want to spoil the surprise, but you can walk behind all the clock faces, watch the bell chime (go for the 12 o'clock visit, it is fabulous), the steel structure vibrates as big ben rings, see the mechanisms etc. The views are fabulous across London and the speaker/guide is fantastic. A trip I will never forget. Everyone should visit. (They do warn about the number of stairs which worried me as I'm not fit, but I was fine and you get to stop at various points through the tower.) The only downside is you aren't allowed to take photos."

Breakfast included was also very good, supposedly continental, but I took a huge full English from the buffett and no one said a word :) All the staff were very friendly and helpful and location is great. you should understand one thing that you should plan early before visit the big ben. i was prepared before go there because in this regard i visited a site to know about big ben, http://spirittourism.com/pleasure/monuments/big-ben-top-tourist-attraction-london/"

There nothing much to see for the clock itself unless if you're a UK resident in which case they have a special tour for you. The best spot to take pics and videos is probably close or on Westminster Bridge, although the area around there is quite crowded. Another possibility is on Parliament Square, although Big Ben will be quite far in the distance. The best time to record video, especially of the hourly chimes, is obviously to go when it will chime (and strike Big Ben) the most based on the hour of the day - i.e. late in the morning at or before 12 noon and late at night at or before 12 midnight. It's a bit disappointing to hear it chime at 1 PM. However, it will play chimes at 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the hour as I recall.I didn't visit Big Ben at night, although I can imagine how special it would look during that time of day. It's not worth a trip in itself, so just take some pictures when you go to Westminster Abbey, Palace of Westminster (Parliament), Churchill War Rooms, County Hall, etc."

The tour was informative and interesting, the guide was engaging but not tediously so and the climb was not too bad, there were three stops on the way up and down so it was very doable.We went up to the belfry to see Big Ben itself and were given ear plugs for the midday bells and then we went down for a walk behind all four faces of Big Ben, awesome. Great experience and fantastic architecture of the clock tower and great views from the belfry, do it."

Or you can just admire it from wherever you can and listen to the Clock Chime, It is much better seeing it in person rather than in books or photos on the Internet !!"

Only downside is the hygiene which can be quite bad on a busy weekend where litters are left behind by tourist which was make worst by the fact there is not litter bin on the pedestrian.

Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London, and often extended to refer to the clock and the clock tower. The clock's movement is famous for its reliability. The clock has become a symbol of the United Kingdom, particularly in the visual media. When a television or film-maker wishes to indicate a generic location in the country, a popular way to do so is to show an image of the tower, often with a red double-decker bus or black cab in the foreground."

My husband and I stayed in the Trafalgar Square area of London last week from Aug 16-22 and enjoyed seeing Big Ben and hearing it chime every day we were there. When you're in central London anywhere near the North or South Bank of the River Thames, you can see it towering watchfully over the city. You can see it from the streets, from the river, from the London Eye and many other places. But, I think it's best viewed walking across Westminster Bridge. Standing beneath it on the street is especially impressive! It\u2019s gorgeous - massive and elegantly dressed in gold, with its enormous hands and beautiful chimes that sound every 15 minutes. It is especially impressive when its stately bell sounds on the hour. Big Ben is one of the most beloved and enduring symbols of London and is not to be missed while you're in town."

The tour lasts about an hour and a half and our guide was very knowledgable and even showed me where my work was when we got to the bell section as he used to work there too!You go through an underground tunnel to get to Big Ben which feels so 007! There is a statue of a unicorn in the tunnel too which I thought was awesome. We were in a small group and did the \"climb\" in 4 stages. You get to see all the mechanical workings of the clocks and the bells and you go behind the clock faces. Then you are by the bells when it tolls on the hour. Afterwards our guide took us to another area that is open to the public (can't remember what it is called but it links to all the Parliamentary rooms). Amazing tour and a must do for every British citizen! Especially as it is free lol"

More than just a working clock chiming the hours away, this is a must see in London. We were impressed by the intricate detail. The crowds were huge on a hot July afternoon. We jumped off our Hop on Hop off bus tour to take photos and enjoyed a cruise on the Thames as well for a different view. One caution, beware of pickpockets. We saw one get caught on the bridge."

This tour was just amazing! you do have to wait about 4-6 months for it, but it's worth it! our tour guide was very informative, and the whole tour was timed perfectly, we made it to each level in time to see the whole process of Big Ben and the workings of the clock. Watching the bells chime at 5:00pm was incredible, and actually getting stand behind the huge clock faces, and even tap the glass, was brilliant. So glad I came across this, and so glad we did it. Now every time we see the clock and hear Big Ben it will always bring back fond memories. Only for UK residents though folks!"

When the hour comes, it does chime soundly and pleasantly and its such a great feeling to be able to hear in front of you.Surrounding the Big Ben is the River Thames, the Parliament, and the famous London Bridge. So you can spend a couple of hours here, moving from one landmark attraction to another. The city sightseeing bus has a stop here and if you purchase a day's pass, you are also entitled to take a free ferry along the River Thames and its another unique feeling and angle to see this Big Ben and the surrounding nice buildings and monument structures etc.You will be amazed of the Big Ben and so its definitely worth the time and effort to be there!!!"

This is a very old and forbidden way of gambling as it is ALWAYS a set up. People who were not british (I was informed that they were from Romania or former soviet states) in groups of 3 or 4 were trying to steal passengers pretending they were strangers who were tempted to play and - what a surprise! - got allthe luck doubling their bet ( which was almost always 40 pounds).

I heard that it's not open to public unless you have invitation to visit the clock tower. This makes it just a landmark that you possibly want to take some pictures with to keep your London memories alive forever. Not only the fact that it's a four-faced clock tower, but also its positioning at the bank of Thames helps tourist taking photographs in many ways. I'd recommend you to try different standing in front of different sides of the tower as it has huge impact on the 'look and feel' of your pictures. Of course, Westminster Bridge is a good position to place Big Ben at the backdrop, but if you have wide-angle lens, try standing at the green field located beside Westminster Abbey and also at the cross-junction situated near the Big Ben. Moreover, because of the color and materials of the tower, you'll find amazing effects if you take pictures at night."

As our bus went around London throughout the day, we got to see it from different angles, and at different times of day in different light which was amazing. Also heard the bell, which you wouldn't want to miss out on- it goes every 15 minutes. Truly one of the world's treasures... And much larger than I thought it would be!"

The image of the Palace of Westminster (the official name for the building containing the Houses of Parliament) and its clocktower known as Big Ben (to everyone except pedants, who will tell you that Big Ben is in fact the name of the bell, not the tower) has become an icon of icons. It is the scene most evocative of the capital's timeless nature, and yet all is not as it seems. Although the site has been in use for almost 1,000 years -- first as a royal palace, and then from the 16th century onward as the seat of Parliament -- most of what you see dates only from the mid-19th century. It was designed in a deliberately medieval-looking, \"Gothic Revival\" style to replace an earlier structure that burned down in 1834. There are, however, much older sections hidden within, including the 11th-century Westminster Hall, which still boasts its 14th-century hammerbeam roof, and the 14th-century Jewel Tower ."

There is a nice stone sitting area (kind of, it's more of some steps and a wall) right across the green for you to stare at. There's also a handy statue of Abraham Lincoln nearby. I don't know why that's handy but it is. I was lucky enough to be admiring Big Ben when the Horse Guard trotted by in all of their glory.

Its chimes are even more famous and familiar.Here are some less well known facts about Big Ben:\u2022Each dial is seven metres in diameter\u2022The minute hands are 4.2 metres long and weigh about 100kg (including counterweights)\u2022The numbers are approximately 60cm long\u2022There are 312 pieces of glass in each clock dial\u2022A special light above the clock faces is illuminated when parliament is in session\u2022Big Ben's timekeeping is strictly regulated by a stack of coins placed on the huge pendulum. \u2022Big Ben has rarely stopped. Even after a bomb destroyed the Commons chamber during the Second World War, the clock tower survived and Big Ben continued to strike the hours.\u2022The chimes of Big Ben were first broadcast by the BBC on 31 December 1923, a tradition that continues to this day.Well worth a visit."

If you are a resident of the UK - please do take advantage and see inside.See http://www.parliament.uk/visiting/visiting-and-tours/tours-of-parliament/bigben/for details.(Unfortunately - 6 month in advance booking as so popular)The tour guide I had was enthusiastic and knowledgeable. It was well worth the 334 steps to the bell - a tour I will remember for a very long time and will no doubt repeat, if I can with any future visitors to our house. A high light was walking 'behind' the four faces of the clock - seeing the hands silluetted in reverse behind the milky white glass. Also nipped across to see the house of commons in action and the wonderful St Stephen's and Westminster halls. With a stop for a scone and a cup of tea on a beautiful day - what could be better?!!"

There are sights within cities that define the city. memorable sights that instantly identify the city and the clock tower at one end of the Houses of Parliament is one of these. Commonly known as Big Ben this striking clock tower stands overlooking the River Thames. Built in the 1860's Big Ben is actually the bell within the clock but for well over a century now the clock and tower itself has fashioned the name. A must see for any London visitor and quite amazing is seen from the London Eye. Listen out for the chimes and watch for the London buses flying by. It can only mean you are in the English capital, London."

This monument is attracting your eyes non stop, because it is so unique, old, lively, cute, well really it was impressing us. We took quite a lot of photos and we will soon post them to this review, so that you can also enjoy what we saw.Just be aware that it is difficult to make nice pictures without anybody on it... I mean that there are a lot of people in London, a lot of tourists and every time you will try to take a nice photo, someone will be around, pass behind or simply stand where it will disturb you, so expect it and be ready for such inconvenient ;-)."

Your first visit to London would be incomplete without seeing the iconic Elizabeth Tower (also referred to as Big Ben). If you plan your visit correctly, you can hear the Westminster chimes and Big Ben ringing at the turn of the hour, as it has done for nearly 150 years. Everyone knows the sound of Big Ben, hearing it up close is one of the most memorable London experiences. A great way to spend a morning in Westminster is to arrive around 8.50 am so you can be around to hear Big Ben sound off at 9am. Then, you can make your way over to Westminster Abbey to queue for the opening at 9.30am. If you are in a group, one member can stand in the queue to enter the abbey, while the rest of your party walk across the street to Parliament Square to see the statues of important historical figures like Abraham Lincoln, Nelson Mandela and Winston Churchill. This takes around 5-10 minutes time. If it is sunny outside, you will have opportunity to take some lovely pictures of Elizabeth Tower with blue skies at your back as the light conditions are usually very good at this early hour of the day. Then it will be time to enter Westminster Abbey at 9.30am for your visit to this excellent historical attraction. Visits here will last 90-120 minutes, ending a great morning in Westminster, taking in two of London's most famous and iconic attractions."

Only that it is the most welcoming sight and sound, day or night that ensures that you are where you are. I also enjoy when it rings out along with Westminster Abbey bells in Parliament square. There are great looking black fence posts and finials which add drama to pictures surrounding the clock tower. Naturally, one must video old Ben as it rings out, especially around 9 or 10 o' clock. It is a special construction that \"is\" London, and those who take it for granted as they scurry by are missing out on a visage that pulls my eyes to it until it is out of sight."

I've heard you can get a tour of the inside but need to make a booking waaaay in advance.If you're on a budget/on limited time stop by anyway as it is a London icon and only a few steps away from Westminster Abbey which is truly magnificent; snap a quick shot and go on to explore the Westminster area which holds plenty of attractions."

So we may say in the common talk, that it reffers either to the clock or clock tower. The tower is officially known as the Elizabeth Tower and by its height stands as the third-tallest free-standing clock tower in the world. Almost at the top of the tower is the largest four-faced chiming clock in the world.That was another jewel of english craftsmanship, I had seen in great City Of London."

If you walk to it across the Westminster Bridge, you can get some really great pictures. We didn't get to hear it chime, but I'm told it's quite loud. Big Ben is one of the essential, iconic, must-see tourist attractions in London. It doesn't take up a lot of your time to visit if you skip the actual tours, and it costs nothing. The plethora of public transportation makes it really easy to get there. You'll also be in the right area to visit Parliament, The Eye, Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham Palace. Definitely go!

Your jaw drops each time & to listen to him chime is a very proud moment. I have seen Big Ben in winter rain & brilliant sunshine & covered at night in fireworks, & he is spectacular. You have not been to London if you have not stood outside Big Ben. I was lucky enough to see inside his mechanism & he is massive. I love Big Ben always will & when you see him you will understand why he is a National Treasure we are proud of. A must see."

UK residents can get a free tour of Elizabeth's Tower (Big Ben's clock tower) and see the bells, go behind the clock face, and see how the mechanism works. You are taught about the history of the bell. The tour needs to be booked at least two months in advance by contacting your local MP. Tours are not open to the general public or non-resident tourists. We had a lovely time. You have to climb all the stairs to the top, but this is done by stopping off at various points, and it was fine. We did this on a very hot day in July. The highlight was seeing the bells strike on the hour."

Tours need to be booked at least two months in advance. It was well worth it. We climbed all of the stairs to see Big Ben and were told how it worked and were shown the gears and mechanisms and went behind the clock face. It was very informative. We went up at the end of July, and it was very hot then, but we had several stops along the way. You don't climb all steps at once. Seeing the bells get struck was the highlight."

If you don't have a picture with this tower, it's like you've never been to London anyways. Its sad that we really didn't enter the building though. We just took a picture with this view in the background.When you ride the London Eye, this is one of the prettiest views because of the effects of the lights.Be careful with your belongings when you go here though, since this place can be congested with a lot of tourists."

When Parliament is not sitting it reverts to the Crown as the 'Palace of Westminster' and can be toured with a guide through prior arrangement with a British MP or through an office near Westminster Abbey (over the road). This building is well worth a visit and allows you access to both the House of Lords and the House of Commons.Security is tight but not rude."

            "review": "Big Ben and the Elizabeth Tower: The face of London. Big Ben is the name of the 14 tonne bell located in the iconic Elizabeth Tower (formerly known as the Clock Tower) that rises above the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. The tower with its four-faced clock is easily one of the most recognisable buildings in the world. It has long been a symbol for the city of London and is an attraction that all first time visitors to London should try to see. Historically, the Clock Tower was included in the reconstruction of the Houses of Parliament building in 1844. Big Ben, which is interestingly a second attempt at making the famous bell (the original cracked, was melted down and recast) rang for the first time 1858 and has reliably been providing the time for Londoners and city visitors ever since. The tower is beautifully set alongside the River Thames. You can see it clearly from many locations. We like views from across the river near the the London Eye and when approaching on Westminster bridge, where you can find many spots to stop and take unobstructed views of the tower and House of Parliament building. The ringing of the Big Ben bell occurs on the hour and is accompanied by four smaller bells which play the famous Westminster Quarters melody on the quarter hour. It is a lovely and almost calming melody and greatly enhances the experience of visiting Elizabeth Tower. As such, its worth sticking around long enough to hear the Westminster Quarters if possible. Hint: For an impressive introduction to Big Ben and the tower, use the Bridge Street exit the Westminster Tube Station. You will first see the Queen Boudica Statue. Then you'll find yourself face-to-face with the tower and its beautiful clock staring directly down on you. Its a great way to see the tower for the first time."

Therefore unless you get a guided tour (not available to non UK citizens) then you will not see It. The best you can do is hear it and view the tower which makes for a quick photo opportunity but really there is little to see. This part of Westminster is almost always incredibly crowded. Many people associate the tower with London and therefore it's worth a brief visit but I would utilise my time elsewhere."

            "review": "Unique and Very Interesting. In November 2013 my partner and I decided to have a weekend in London, the main catalyst for this idea being we had been booked in for a Elizabeth 'Big Ben' Tower Tour. Many people I spoke to before and after (including myself) did not know you could go up the tower and clock face or how to obtain tickets. Luckily my partner did. You must contact your local MP (email works perfectly and MP addresses can be found on the internet) and request tickets for the tour. This is a limited tour and they can only book you in up to three months in advance. They do most week days at 11:15 and 14:15 but not weekends. It may be to get on the tour you have to take what is available or like us miss out the first time and get one the second time of asking. Actually the lady who booked this was excellent. Having not been available for the first three months they offered, a month later she wrote back (without reminder) with a selection of times for the new third month now available, of which one we took. We were sent our confirmations and safety forms in the post and ready to go. Allow about 75 minutes for the tour and turn up on time as there are warnings people who are late will miss out.When the day comes you will need ID - photo card, ie driving licence or passport and a utility bill to prove address (this is despite already having the tickets, so do not forget them). You meet at Portcullis House, which when you come out of Westminster Underground, turn left and to the end of the pavement and turn left again (do not cross the road) and Portcullis House is on the left. There is an airport style security check here but is quick and painless. You then meet your tour guide in the lobby area. You can leave bags behind as there are many steps and it is quite tight but you will have to leave cameras in the locker provided as there are no photos at all permitted. Phones can be taken but must be switched off.You start by going through a small piece of Portcullis House, which is impressive in itself and to the left joining a tunnel that goes under the road and brings you to the door and first two steps of your journey up the tower. This is not for those who lack fitness, who have health issues or are afraid of heights. There are over 300 steps up this tower (and of course the same back down again) and it is just over 200 foot high. Be sure to take a look up through the gap in spiralling stair case for an impressive view of what you are about to climb (and back down again on the return). After a good number of spiral turns you come to room one for a small breather and more information. From start to finish the tour guide was full of knowledge and interesting facts and I do not think there was anything she did not know.Having had a little sit down it is up to the clock faces, which you get to stand behind. It is a surreal experience standing behind one of the most iconic sights in the UK, if not the world. From here it is up to the actual bell 'Big Ben'. If you are here in a winter or colder month be sure to wrap up. The bell is semi outside and the wind will get in easily, making for a very cold experience if not wearing enough. If you do the 11:15 tour as we did, you will hear the chimes at 11:30, 11:45 and 12:00 and of course the main 12:00 bell ringing. Do not worry you do get ear defenders whilst standing next to it! The views from up here are also excellent. Again you can look down to get an idea of just how high up you are but not recommended for those of a nervous disposition.Having experienced the bell at full throttle you get to go down a room and see the actual mechanics of it, which is thoroughly amazing and interesting. Then it is the long walk back down, which is easier than going up.When back at the lobby you are allowed with the passes you have to wonder around Portcullis House itself (can not access everything) but it is an intriguing design and worth a look.This is an excellent tour and seemingly quite unique as many people I spoke to had no idea you could do it. It has only been running for 10 years and only 5 years as a regular tour weekly. It was quite brilliant standing and going up such a famous landmark, all without cost and I would definitely recommend this. If you are particularly keen on clocks or how everything works machine wise, add a star and make this 5 out of 5."

First off, it\u2019s a must see if this is your first time to London. Big Ben and the Tower Bridge are the two icons that most people instantly recognise as London.Plus if you\u2019re there, you\u2019re also close to lots of other places to visit, like Parliament, Westminster Bridge, the London Eye, Whitehall, Westminster Abbey, and the surrounding gardens.It is possible to go up the tower and see the bell, and stand behind the clock faces, but it\u2019s not easy. First, you have to climb 334 steps of a spiral staircase. Second, you have to be a resident of the UK, make an appointment with your MP or a member of the House of Lords that you might happen to know, and wait for the first available slot. At the time of writing, October 2013, availability will open up around February 2014."

Good view of the boats heading down the River Thames and Southside. You need to walk across the Westminster Bridge toward the London Eye to appreciate an excellent view of the House of Parliament and Big Ben. We went early Saturday morning around 8:30a.m. and there was practically no crowds there, only around 5-10 people there. Wonderful photo opportunities at that time and no worries about the crowds. I understand that the only people who are allowed on top of the Big Ben bell are residents of England; therefore, any visitors outside from there will have no accessibility to the top. Anyhow, regardless, it is something every London visitor (especially 1st time) should see, especially the color changes during the course of the day- great for photographers."

It's good fun. its free. the nearest tube is Westminster but if your staying outside London you can take the train to waterloo station and its a 5 minute walk over the bridge. when you are there its tradition to set you watch to the time. Love it ! there is no reason to be disappointed. I would recommend taking public transport as the traffic can be horrific and parking terrifying"

Never having been to this part of London, I was surprised that the clock tower wasn't taller. By the way, it's the bell that chimes the hours that is called Big Ben, so unless you get a trip to see the clock mechanism, you can't even \"see\" Big Ben. It's a bit like people called the UK flag \"Union Jack\". Big Ben is the bell, and our flag is a Union Flag, unless it's on a boat or ship.The area around The Palace Of Westminster is meticulously maintained, but overall somewhat spoilt by the security barriers etc. but vital in today's world.A good photo opportunity from all sides and just over the river from the Millennium Wheel, no visit to London would be complete with a few pictures of a truly world class landmark."

We found ourselves there on New Years Eve among all the locals everyone taking a spot to watch the midnight fireworks which I felt like the best view was watching Big Ben explode into lights.

The tower is officially named the Elizabeth Tower, holding the largest four-faced chiming clock (Big Ben) in the world and is the third-tallest free-standing clock tower on Earth (or so the guidebooks say). For fun, call home 2 minutes before the hour\u2026. and let them hear BIG BEN!"

If you live in the UK, email your MP and get free tickets to climb the tower (a few months ahead) You enter via portcullis house and the tour lasts about an hour. You are in a group of about 15 and there are about 334 steps, but you stop 3 times during the climb so its very easy. You stand directly underneath the bells and hear it strike, the sound is simply unbeatable and you must hear it close up. Incredible experience. Bags are not allowed up the tower but free safe storage is provided, you need to take your passport and proof of address (bill) to be allowed admittance."

You'll need to do so in advance (I think we had to do it months in advance). After clearing security you are taken in a group of about twenty and start to climb the staircase before stopping for a brief talk on the history and working of the clock. You then complete the climb to see behind the clock faces (you know they're big but can't appreciate just how big until you are standing behind one), the workings of the clock mechanism, the bells including, of course, Big Ben itself (himself?) Tours are timed (ours was and I would think that they all are) so that you are standing at the bells when they chime - very impressive (and loud but you are given ear defenders).An excellent tour and well worth the climb to see behind the scenes of this London icon."

Email confirmation and communication was via our MP's research assistant and they arranged for us to tour the Houses of Parliament with them after our Big Ben tour.Our guide for the Elizabeth Tower was Katherine (I think that was her name). She was superb. So enthusiastic and knowledgeable, she made the tour so enjoyable, I can only express my thanks to her.The climb is long 334 steps but broken with two stops on the way up for finding out more information. You see everything, the old hammer, the clock workings, the bells (we were at the top when they chimed 3 o'clock). You have to wear ear plugs at the top but it was brilliant to be up there when it chimes. You also get to go behind the clock faces (all of them) which was fantastic.The only downside is you can't take any photographs at all, which is a shame as I would love to show family and friends.We took our 14 year old son and he loved it. Found out so much information and I would highly recommend this to anyone. Apply now it's well worth it and it's free."

Up close you see the amazing craftsmanship that was used to make all the pillars and the roof and st. Stephen's tower that big ben is housed in.

Having jumped off the tube at Westminster, his face was a picture as as we emerged from the station and he saw \"Big Ben\" for the fast time and exclaimed, \"Wow, it's even bigger than I thought!\"For those that don't know, Big Ben is actually the nick-name of the bell inside the tower. The Clock Tower at the north end of the Palace of Westminster was completed in 1859. The Great Clock started ticking on 31st May, with the Great Bell's strikes heard for the first time on 11th July and the quarter bells first chimed on 7th September. The Clock Tower was renamed \"The Elizabeth Tower in honour of Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee in 2012.Getting a good photo of the clock tower can be quite tricky. I tried as I crossed over Westminter Bridge but the crowds kept getting in the way. It's so tall that a close shot is almost impossible! I managed to get some good ones with my family looking tiny in the foreground from near Westminster Abbey. The best vantage point to get shots of he whole of the Palace of Westminster is from the London Eye."

The bells have been booming from the Victorian gothic tower since the 1860s, but there is still confusion about what is which - and why the names have become what they are.Big Ben is the name given to the second great bell cast for the tower at the end of the Houses of Parliament. It's nearly E Natural (for the musical buffs) and it stands in what was until last September called the Bell Tower. However, to mark her 60 years on the throne, it was renamed the Elizabeth Tower.Twice a day - at 6pm and midnight - its chimes are heard worldwide and live.Standing alongside Big Ben at midday may seem a quick way to end up permanently deaf, but it is one of the few free tours (yes, that's right) that can be done in London these days. What's more you can keep the earplugs that you are given.Look on the web for booking information. We did it through an MP 's office.The guide is exceptional, but starts you off worrying whether you will survive the 330-plus steps to the bell chamber. Well, at around 18 stone and aged 66, I did it yesterday, and was none the worse for the experience.(You have to walk - there is no lift)You meet your guide in the MPs new offices at Portcullis House opposite Parliament Square, then it's a short walk under Westminster Bridge to reach the foot of the famous tower.It's just over 100 steps to the first \"rest camp\" - about the same as most church towers, but with plenty more room and wider steps.Two more breaks are taken and each time your guide gives you more information, facts and anecdotes about the building and the rows, court actions and unusual solutions that occurred during its construction.It was in 1972 that the old copper penny was withdrawn, but a number still play an important part in the task of keeping the clock accurate to within two seconds. But go and see: we are so glad we went."

Stopped and asked a policeman who was lovely, he grabbed my shoulders and turned me around and said 'see that big thing there', I said yes and he said 'well that is Big Ben'. Funny. I just imagined it to be on its own somewhere. The building I liked the look off from across the road was Westminster. Another review for that. So Big Ben was great to see, I walked around the building it was linked to. You cannot go inside but I am glad I saw it."

Don't be too put off by the steps, it is a sprial staircase which is fairly narrow BUT you do get to rest three times (seated) on the way to the top for a good 10-15 mins when the guide will tell you about the history of Big Ben.I hadn't realised we would be close enough to touch the clock face and on a lovely sunny day standing behind the south facing one with the sun streaming in, we could see the second hand moving every two seconds. Very up close and pesonal.The rungs are still there where the gas light would be ignited each night to light the clock face for Londoners and I now know that the light at the very top (forget its name begins with A) is on when parliament is sitting at night. (So that Queen Victoria could see whether her ministers were working). Basically there are three main rooms to see; the clock faces themselves, the room housing the mechanism (really quite fascinating - a huge antique) and the bell tower. We were wearing earplugs (essential but provided) in the bell tower when the clock struck 3pm. An historical day when Margaret Thatcher died, we could see all the parliamentary buildings flags flying at half mast.I went up the tower with our eleven year old son while my husband and 7 year old son amused themselves elsewhere. When our youngest is old enough, we will definitely go back!As an earlier reviewer mentioned, email your local MP for free tickets and incorporate this with a tour of the houses of parliament (our seven year old was old enough for this one).

Facing straight at you when exiting Westminster tube station, this tower is absolute must while in London, jut to get a few shots or to go on a river, Despite the freezing cold weather, we managed to get a few shots and then headed towards Trafalgar square. If you're visiting Big Ben soon and the temperatures are this low, don't go on a river cruise."

Having stayed at a hotel in Westminster, my girlfriend and I passed by Big Ben (now Elizabeth Tower) countless times during our holiday in London in November 2012. The hourly chime always served to remind us of our being in London!Seeing it for ourselves the first time, we felt that the tower looked shorter than we imagined it to be, but were nevertheless impressed by the amount of detail and craftsmanship that went into its construction.On a clear day, Big Ben is also very beautiful set against the blue sky.15 minutes is more than enough to take all the photos you want of this icon of London, making Big Ben somewhat of a 'something to see along the way' rather than an attraction to visit. That being said, it's close to Westminster Abbey, which most people will probably visit.Good points:- Hard to miss once you're in central Westminster.- Many good spots for photo-taking. - Hourly chimes contribute to the atmosphere.Bad points:- Unfortunately, it is not possible for tourists to visit the inside of the Big Ben. UK residents, however, can apparently file a request with their MP to visit.- Feels somewhat underwhelming to just spend 5 - 10 minutes seeing something that is so central to London's identity and simply moving on to somewhere else afterwards.Others:- Spend some time around the area to visit (even if it's just passing by) the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey. It really helps you soak in London's heritage."

I thought it would just be a walk up, have a look and back down again, however our tour guide had so many well presented facts to say about the place that it made it very interesting indeed . This is must to have the chance to go up inside this iconic building . Great views too. Thoroughly enjoyed this visit , I've lived in London all my life and feel privileged to have had the chance to visit.As an aside , this is not a place to bring kids, also the tower may not seem that high from the outside but the staircase is unbelievable when looking straight up from bottom or down from top so think twice if suffer from vertigo . You get to see the workings of the clocks. Walk around behind the clock faces and go up to the bell tower when it's chimes the hour."

We arranged a tour of Elizabeth Tower (the name of the tower that houses Big Ben, which is the bell, not the building) through our local MP, and were allocated a time slot. You go through strict airport-style security just to get in to Portcullis House on the opposite corner where there is a small waiting room with a few seats, and toilets are available. Bags and cameras are not allowed up the tower, and mobile phones must be switched off (partly for security reasons, but also because of the time restraint - a dozen people taking photos of each other all the way up could take half a day!). There is a locked cupboard where bags and coats can be stored, although it is advisable to keep your coat on as the top of the tower is open to the elements, and it can be windy and cold. You get taken under the road and into the Tower by two guides, one at the front and one bringing up the rear. Any health and safety issues are raised before you set off, and anyone who is pregnant, suffers from asthma or vertigo, high or low blood pressure etc, are advised to stick to the back end of the group, so as not to feel any pressure. There were about a dozen or so people in our group. Although there are 334 steps in a spiral staircase, the climb is not as difficult as it sounds - the pace is relaxed, and you can take it at your own speed (hence the guide at the back to bring up the rear); also the steps are not all that steep. You also stop to rest a couple of times on the way up, with seats to relax while the guides fill you in on the history of the tower and bells. The aim is to make it to the level where the Big Ben bell is for the chime on the hour - it is extremely loud and I would recommend that you wear the earplugs that are issued to you. The whole floor vibrates, and it is an amazing experience to be up there for the chime. The view from there is pretty good too. On the way back down you get to walk behind all the four the clock faces (VERY cool!) before descending to the bottom again. You even get a certificate to prove you did it! It was well worth it!"

So try to be there when it strikes on the hour. The best view is from Westminster Bridge, from where you'll see Westminster Palace and Big Ben together.By the way: you'll find another great view of the Big Ben clocktower from the steps to the entrance of the National Gallery on Trafalgar Square. It's a 5-10 minute walk down Whitehall, where you'll pass the Cenotaph monument, Downing Street, the Banqueting House and the Horse Guards. Lots of photo opportunities."

Such an amazing feeling seeing this breathtaking building in person, the pictures don't do it justice. Looks most spectacular at night when it lits up. You also get stunning views over the clock tower from London Eye. A must-see for anyone going to London!"

Ok, first off, let\u2019s get this straight, for the record. What you see is Elizabeth Tower, completed in 1859. What you hear strike every quarter, half and hour is the great bell, nicknamed by Londoners as \u2018Big Ben.\u2019 We say \u2018struck\u2019 because Big Ben doesn\u2019t have a clapper; rather it is struck by a hammer. All UK residents own Big Ben and can tour the Tower for FREE. There are set times and bookings must be made in advance \u2013 at least four months \u2013 and through your local MP. Alas, non UK residents cannot tour the Tower \u2013 this is a UK resident exclusive. But there is an excellent virtual tour at http://www.parliament.uk/bigben. Still, the best way to experience the Tower and Bell is from Westminster Bridge, preferably on as sunny day with a nice breeze, as you gaze down the Thames, enjoying an ice cream."

It's one of those iconic landmarks that when you actually are in front of it, you're not really sure what to do or how long to spend. It's cool, hear it ring, take some pictures and then go on your way. If you want a really cool picture, walk towards the Westminstsr Bridge. There's a horse statue and if you position yourself right on the stairs you can get a super awesome, artsy photo of the statue with Big Ben directly in the background."

If you want a great picture of this beautiful landmark - Houses of Parliament - the best place is right across the river, at the south bank. Not too many people go there and you can take all the pictures you want without bumping into other people. You also get a full view of the building, and the clock. Most tourists take their pictures right in front of the building or on the bridge - in both cases, there are a lot of people and buses and other vehicles that block your view. If you're in London on Remembrance Day, the entire area is closed off to vehicles and, once the ceremonies are over, you can just walk on the street and take pictures up close."

It would be great if there was an opportunity to go inside it and look at the clocks and bells as on the street there is not much to see besides the exterior. There are good photo opportunities from Parliament Square or from the bridge next to it. Westminster Station is right next to it as are a number of other attractions so it's a good idea to combine it with the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey."

Now, it is named Elizabeth Tower, and stands opposite Victoria tower. A story you may NOT know, however, is that the original bell actually cracked during testing, and the replacement cracked three months after it was installed. In the tower, the bell was rotated an eighth of a turn and still rings today, crack and all. If you listen closely as it rings, you can hear the slight flatness and reduced quality, as opposed to the normal pitch and resonance of a large bell. This is a must see while in London. Also, cross the Thames and look back at the towers and hosues of parliament. If you have the opportunity, also see them while lit up at night."

They may not have an enigmatic smile, but its faces are still utterly remarkable to behold; 5 tonnes of iron railings and opal glass, 55 metres off the ground, with hands over 7 metres long and a 35-metre tall cast iron spire. Of course, reading statistics is pointless - go and see it for yourself!"

A couple in their early 80's managed it without looking too puffed out. A guide provides very interesting info. I just wished I could have remembered it all! The obvious highlight is the best view ever over London & of course listening to Big Ben chime at extremely close range (with earplugs provided).

It sits right on the Thames, so after viewing it up close, you could cross over to the other side of the river to view it from a distance. This side of the river offers the best views of the tower. The London Eye provides a great bird's eye perspective, or you could view it from below on a Thames river cruise. If those options are out of your budget, buy an ice cream and sit and watch street performers and artists (not sure if they are there year round, or were just there for the carnival that was taking place) with Big Ben as a backdrop.

Big Ben is the nickname for the great bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London, and is generally extended to refer to the clock or the clock tower (officially known simply as Clock Tower) as well. The clock tower holds the largest four-faced chiming clock in the world and is the third-tallest free-standing clock tower. It celebrated its 150th anniversary on 31 May 2009, during which celebratory events took place. The tower was completed on 10 April 1858 and has become one of the most prominent symbols of both London and England, often in the establishing shot of films set in the city."

You will be able to see photos in the future and know what angle it was taken from and what is nearby, etc. Personally, I think a photo, from across the Thames, not far from the London Eye as the sun is setting makes a nice photo. Be prepared for crowds. It's probably fair to compare it to the crowds of Times Square in Manhattan. But, there is so much else to do in the area that wrestling the crowds is completely worthwhile.

The clock tower which is built in Neo-Gothic style, soon to be renamed the Elizabeth Tower, houses Big Ben the bell inside the tower. Big Ben is 13.5 tons. It is made of copper and tin and cracked just 4 years after it was made. It has 7 (4 meter clock faces) and is largest four faced chiming clock in the world housed in the world's 3rd highest clock tower. Each clock face contains 312 pieces and 48 (1 meter fiqures). An inscription in Latin at the base of the clock dial reads, \"Lord\" keep safe our Queen Victoria the First\". Big Ben also has a twitter account that tweets \"Bong\" every hour. Good for office chatter. Easy to get to just take the tube to Westminister station, hop off and you are there. Best photo is from the London Eye although there are many other photo opportunities. Only UK citizens are promitted inside the tower to see the clock. Submit your applications to a member of parliament. Cheers!"

I didn't realise you could visit the inside of the Clock Tower until I heard the government wanted to charge for entry, determined to see the icon of London I wrote that day to my MP and received my 'e-ticket' soon after.Our visit was amazing! The guides made the visit come alive with fascinating facts and tit-bits of information.The walk to the top is quite strenuous and is taken in a couple of stages, the first 140 or so steps end with a sit down in 'Room 2' the only room on the way to the top that is accessible, as the others are closed due to health and safety grounds (there are no toilets in the clock tower, and no lift)There is a brief talk of the history of the tower before ascending the remaining 200 or so steps to the rear of the clock faces, then on to the belfry, which seems to be well timed for the hourly chimes (10am in our case) and all I can say is WOW! The bells are so loud! You also get to see fantastic views of London while up here, an old ventilation shaft that drops to the floor (a long 64 metres down!) The BBC microphones used to broadcast the chimes across the airwaves, the repair work to Big Ben to correct the tone of the bell when a crack formed a few years after installation.The visit then progresses in to the clock room where the three parts of the clock mechanism are explained in wonderful detail - including the adjustments made with old pennies to the pendulumAfter this you receive a certificate to confirm you climbed to the top of the clock tower!This visit is easily worth the proposed fee, and it's a pity in a way it won't be introduced, as there is serious conservation work required to the clock faces, and due to a short fall in funding the 5 yearly clock face clean has been cancelled this year :o(There is no access to food and drink in either the clock tower, or the meeting point of Portcullis House, also, there are no toilets in the clock tower!"

The clock tower and Palace of Westminster makes for some great pictures and looks really nice at night. Our hotel was directly across the street and when walking towards it from Vauxhall station, it was incredible. Take the time to see it when visiting London, it is free after all...Here's a big of trivia for you... Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell inside the clock tower and is thought to be named after Ben Caunt, a champion heavyweight boxer of the 1850s OR named after Sir Benjamin Hall, First Commissioner for Works 1855-1858. Nobody knows which is true."

Big Ben is of course really the bell, but is more often used to describe the entire building at the east end of the Houses of Parliament.How can you not love this icon of London? It's not massive by modern standards, a mere 96 metres high (the Empire State Building is 448 metres and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai 828 metres tall). You can't visit it other than to view it from the outside. However, you are able to get good views from north and south of the river, all all times of day and night, and in all lighting conditions. If you are in London for a few days, it would be worth taking in Big Ben from several perspectives at different times."

This right of passage is as basic as the photo of you emerging from a red phone booth, \"surprised\" to have your photo snapped. The challenge here is to bring originality to your photo. Most people stand near Winston Churchill's statue to snap Big Ben because it saves walking. Maybe you could wend your way along the Thames and take your photo looking back from the river? It is a challenge to your ingenuity to take a new pose, because a zillion people have gone before you. It takes a wide angle lens to get much more than just the top of the Clock Tower, otherwise it appears to lean or bend. This could prove interesting if you also are good at leaning! Actual tours of just the Clock Tower (Big Ben is the name of the 13 ton bell inside) are limited to British nationals. When Parliament considered naming The Clock Tower after Queen Elizabeth II, it was pointed out that everyone refers to it by the wrong name anyway, calling the whole thing \"Big Ben\", so what was the point? After you take your photo, set your watch. It's free!"

And ideally go do the Parliament Tour as you can then be on the grounds and get some better views/ detail. It's quite fun to be around when it chimes as well. Good quick stop to see a main big \"sight\"- and close to other things you can then do: Parliament, Westminster Abbey, #10 Downing Street, Trafalgar Square and more."

But there are many other parties too. You are taken up to the top of the tower - passing the room where Emily Pankhurst was held prisoner - and you are told to be careful whilst the clock strikes the hour - round the four outside bells and then Big Ben itself. The guide gives a lecture for 15 minutes when everybody is surprised by the 15 minute peel. A great experience."

This area isn't famous for its night-life just the stunning architecture. Have a look at the building directly opposite, not sure what it is now but it used to be Crown Court, the top floor was one huge circular court all in rich red leather! Just up the road is the changing of the guard and Churchill's underground war rooms. Cross over Westminster Bridge and on the South Embankment of the Thames where London Council used to have their offices is the London Aquarium. Take a peep at your guide or map book and you'll see there's just so much to see around this area, take the next Bridge along and on the south side is Lambeth Palace, I think this is the archbishop of Canterbury's official residence ... not 100 yards from Scotland yards famous forensic science lab. Going back to Big Ben look opposite, next to the Westminster Abbey is a large mediaeval building, in the olden days this is where all the money, gold and wealth collected by the king in taxes was kept, in the age of King Richard 1st (the Lionheart) this was used to finance the crusades to Jerusalem. There's 'Queen' Boudicca's statue on the North side of Westminster bridge and right next to Big Ben but in the grounds of the house of Parliament is a pretty little green light mounted on the railings, when an MP whose been working late wants a taxi he presses a button a the light goes on, a taxi then enters and collects him ... save shim having to stand on the street with the peasants! Go on look around, find King the statue of Oliver Cromwell who overthrew King James in the 1600's ... and what about King James? Is he depicted in such splendour? No, right opposite Cromwell's magnificent statue on the other side of the road in a grubby little alcove cut into Westminster Abbey is a bust of Charlie boy, looking straight at parliament. Its all there just a stone throw from Big Ben, and to finish on Big Ben, apart from the fact the its leaning over like the leaning tower of Pizza the whole timing mechanism is regularly tuned and balanced, not by computer but by placing old one penny pieces on one edge, the weight of these keeps everything just so ... enjoy."

The tour is a small group, you get to see the inner workings of the clock tower, and witness big Ben chime, (ear plugs are provided for free). The only way up the tower is on the narrow steps but there are plenty of rest breaks with information on the way up. Personally I found it interesting to hear about the engineering behind the tower and the bell and once we got down our guide asked if we had seen the houses of parliament, as we said we had not another guide quickly showed us around while on his break. All this was for free! It was a wonderful day out!"

On days I walk fromn Westminister Tube to my office of back I often see visitors who set eyes on Big Ben for the first time. It is so obviously a special moment for many of them; you can see it in their facial expression and sometimes their overall reaction. The feeling similar to the one I have experienced when first visiting othr iconic sights like Machu Picchu, Angkor Wat, my wife's home city of Halong Bay, The Pyramids and Taj Mahal. Can I really compaire Big Ben to any of these? Maybe or maybe not but it is obvious the pleasure it brings to millions and it is one of the must see sights for just about any visitor to London. Surely some are disappointed, I mean it is just a tower with a clock on, right. I guess if you look at it that way you may be but it is dammed impressive in its own right and seen on a crisp clear winter morning when the sky is blue and tourists are moderate in number is seeing it at its best. Very few who see it can ever get to climb up inside though there are a few who maage to - over forty years in London I have stll not but one day maybe. For now though I take it as a free sight and one of the pleasures of working in Westminister. I never get board of seeing Big Ben, hearing its chimes and best of all seeing the reaction of visitors who travel from all over the world. If you vsit don't miss it and look for the smiles, even if the clock fails to float your boat it will make the day of someone nearby and their smile will make yours. Enjoy."

This is a brilliant free attraction and worth doing, simply email yoir MP and you can go and visit the clock tower, go up the inside to see the clock working and stand under the bells as the hour stikes its absolutely fantastic.Our guide was very informative and had good presentation skills, there are over 300 steps to the top but you stop twice on the way up.First stop is a third of the way up and you go into a room for a little presentation, this is to give you a rest more than anything else. You then move up to the clock mechanism and get to see the workings of the clock, you then move to the belfry where you arrive just before the hour and actually watch the hammers stike the tune and then its big bens turn to ring the hour.Security is very tight and no photography allowed, we were searched twice and had to take passports and a utility bill too but its well worth the hassle, highly reccomended"

Since early 2011, per current restrictions, non-UK citizens are not allowed to visit as too much hassle to go through the background checks.It is not for the faint of heart as it is several flights of stairs. They also give ear plugs so that your ears are not damaged when the bells ring while you are in the tower. There are a few rest breaks (with some history lessons to boot!) at different rooms on the way up, so you don't have to walk up in 1 straight go.Highly recommended if you are able to do so! No cost!"

This is because the chimes issuing directly from Big Ben are delayed due to the distance travelled, so the \"thirteenth\" chime is a repeat of the twelfth that you already heard just before it came over the radio."

We found out a few days ago that it has started to lean, but we did not notice the clock tower to be leaning. If we can offer one caviat...be aware of women attempting to sell paper flowers on the bridge. They were asking for donations for a hospital at the time, but quickly arose our suspicions when they could not provide the name of the hospital to us, and furthermore, asked for paper money only. These women must work the bridge everyday, as locals just walk right by them. The Houses of Parliament is also located next to Big Ben and it is open for tours on Saturdays only. We were not able to tour the Houses of Parliament as we had made other plans, but plan to do so on our next visit to London. Located just over the bridge from Big Ben is the London Eye. Riverboat cruises are also available in the immediate area. Overall, a great way to spend a few hours."

However if you stop and take some time to admire the Tower, you will then realise how beautiful it is. It's extremely ornate with some beautiful detailing. Many people stop right underneath it to take pictures, which is a good viewpoint but the problem here is that there are so many tourists milling around, you will get knocked and bumped around. Find a quiet spot, perhaps on the bridge and take some photos. You can also get a great view when standing in from of the House of commons.Not many people realise that you can actually get a tour of Big Ben. Unfortunately it is only available to UK nationals and has to be booked months in advance.

It's good that it's right in front of the tube station so you can go to another place quickly.One thing that I want to warn you all about is to be careful when you are at the Big Ben. When we were taking pictures of us in front of the clocktower, a couple of women approached us, giving us flowers saying that it's childrens day today and asked us to donate money. We all took out a couple of coins each to donate and they were like \"No we only accept moneybills and then they just grabbed the money we had in our purses and ran away. We manage to follow one of the women for 30 minutes begging her to give our money back which she didn't. Instead she took a cab and ran away.And you won't get any help from the other people. Not even the people in the little shops and icecream vans there. They will say that they can't do anything, not even helping you call the police. But when we finally manage to contact the police they were very helpful.So be careful at Big Ben because the police told us the same thing happens ALOT to tourists there at Big Ben and probably other attractions too."
