So when you have the opportunity to visit a chapel containing not one, not two, but three paintings by Caravaggio therein, you really should take it. The St Matthew series is profound, and a marked contrast from the paintings of the previous century that you may see in Rome. And the rest of the church isn't half bad either!

This church is special in that regard because you get to see an entire chapel with paintings only by Caravaggio. The theme of the three paintings is the events from the life of St Matthew, an Apostle of Christ. All the people who posed for Caravaggio were common folk, people of the streets, and when looking at these paintings you begin to understand the importance of the new, gritty realistic style Caravaggio introduced into art. Wrinkled skin, sweaty bodies and dirty fingernails and feet have never looked so fascinating!The paintings are very large, and, as is typical in many Roman churches that have famous works of art, you have to drop coins into a box here to light them up.The church is dedicated to the French king Louis IX, who became a saint. Because of the French connection, the ceiling has a large fresco by Charles-Joseph Natoire, a popular 18th-century French painter. The church is quite plain outside, and thus it doesn't invite you in. But it's worth it to go through the door to see Caravaggio's startling paintings.I'll rate this \"Very Good\" on the strength of the Caravaggio paintings. Apart from that, the rest of the church is similar to a lot of other Baroque ones in Rome."

Here we found this jewel of french designed baroque religious edifice. The Piazza San Luigi de' Francesi is rather small and the facade of this french church instantly attracts the attention apart from the other so characteristic Rome buildings in the ochre colour, that are situated in the same Piazza.This church is dedicated to Virgin Mary, to St.Danis and St.Louis IX, king of France. Great contribution to the building of this church between 1518 and 1589 was done by Catherine de' Medici, who ruled in France in the second half of XVIth century. As a matter of fact, it can be said that this church is the national church in Rome of France.Seen from outside, there are several statues that remind us on the french history with the Charlemagne, St.Louis, St.Clothilde and St.Jeanne of Valois presentations in the stone.When we entered inside, we perceived the frescoes on the walls, that depicted the stories of Saint Louis IX, Saint Denis and Clovis.The organ is set high above the floor of the church, over the fenced marble balcony with the pair of angels on both sides of it, as they support whole white structure of terrace.But the church's most famous treasure is the cycle of paintings painted by the Baroque master Caravaggioo about the life of St. Matthew.We stayed for a certain period of time in front of these magnificent paintings of the great artist, which showed us the biblical life of St.Matthew and all these in such recognisable dark tones and colours, always referred to Caravaggio.Great church, we liked it so much !"

This beautiful, Baroque church is in the old French area of Rome, not far from the Palazzo Farnese, the French Embassy (only open for pre-booked tours in the afternoon). It is of note primarily for the St. Matthew Cycle of paintings by Caravaggio, the quality of which paintings shine out amongst the other rather duller paintings in the various chapels, though it costs only \u20ac1 to light three other chapels (and make your own decisions on that opinion) which I thought a bargain! Unfortunately, when I visited the Caravaggios they were just being readied for conservation but I was still able to see most of one, a good part of another though only a small piece of the third.The church is smothered in gold, heavily textured and has a lot of beautiful marble in various shades of red. It still offers Services and Confession in French and, being French, has chosen to offer translations only from French into Italian - except for the Caravaggios, their main money-spinners I should think, where there are explanations and translations in English as well.The church is beautiful and has a lovely 'feel' about it and, since it's so close to Campo de'Fiore, it's well worth having a look around if you're in the area - and don't forget that churches are usually free to enter and always offer that cool and quiet opportunity for a sit-down!"

This is a great thing because the churches are filled with so many artistic treasures, and having them available to the public is wonderful. This particular church, located between the Piazza Navona and Pantheon, has a chapel decorated with paintings by Caravaggio, not unlike the (more famous) Caravaggio chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo. These paintings are massive, and their magnificence cannot appropriately be understood through reproductions. Since this church is located so close to many of the main sights in Roma, there is no reason you shouldn't slip in to appreciate these masterworks; you will not regret it."

By them selves, this would be reason to visit. But wait! Wait! There's more. (Sorry, I loved this place.) The more is the the Contarelli chapel. (Families bought an area of a church and \"decorate\" as they chose.) This three-sided \"room\" contains three huge Caravaggio paintings commissioned by Cardinal Matthew Contarelli. By chance, they focus on the life of St. Matthew--The Calling of St. Matthew, St. Matthew and the Angel, and Martyrdom of St. Matthew. The paintings are amazing.The main church, each of the chapels and the nave are worth a long look. We went back several times.

The Church of St.Louis of the French (San Luigi dei Francesi) is the French National church in Rome, it is a lavishly decorated Baroque church located a short distance away from Piazza Navona. It was built between 1550 and 1568, from the front it looks more like a grand palazzo to me, the front facade is built in travertine marble. The four statues of the St. Clotilde, St Joan of Arc, Charlemagne, and St Louis were apparently added in 1747, but it is what is inside that we have decided to visit. Once inside your eye is immediately drawn to the white and gold ceiling and beautiful frescoes, but tucked inside are three painting by Caravaggio created between 1599 and 1600, they depict the life of St Matthew, when viewing you are within metres away, such valuable treasures."

X-rays show 2 (maybe 3) attempts under the paint. His sponsor wanted what was standard for the time: a whole gallery of bystanders in the background but Caravaggio wasn't happy with what he was painting. So he set it aside to work on the painting on the left, Matteo's Vocazzione. This one came easily but was nothing like other paintings of its time. Caravaggio's ability to \"spotlight\" the drama with light and dark was way ahead of his time. (Think of it -- there were no electric lights then, no spotlights. This lighting came from his imagination and it is powerful.)Look at how Matthew meets Christ's look but also still holds onto his money with his other hand. He is still on the fence about which world he will choose. See how the other money-holders don't even seem to acknowledge Christ, and see how their clothing looks like a different era (on the left side of the painting vs the right side).After Vocazzione, Caravaggio was able to go back to his first painting and did what he wanted, just ignoring the request from his sponsor. This is a frightening painting but here's one thing to consider: Matthew is perhaps not holding out his arm in protest against his assassin but instead reaching for the palm held to him by the angel. The palm signifies martyrdom as well as deliverance. I visited this painting several times and each time got more from it. If it's dark, ask at the souvenir desk about turning on the light boxes -- it's free to see the paintings but take a few euros along to pay for the lighting."

Plus it's fun to see the Italian Army \"Alpini\" guarding the Centre Francese next door in their green felt hats with a feather."

Not far away in the interior is a chapel painted by Domenichino, a slightly younger artist with a completely different use of color and light, but a similar interest in making things seem convincing, showing everything from little kids pulling on their mother's clothes to hurry them out, to a little kid peeing, in paintings in Rome and surrounding Lazio. Since this was the church of French expats, many later French painters came to this church to study these examples of Roman accomplishments. Bring small change, as you'll need to pay for the lights to really see the paintings, even on a sunny day."

Even though you will walk by hundreds of churches in Rome, this is one you must not skip! Keep in mind there is no admission, but you will need a 1 Euro coin to illuminate the paintings. Carvaggio paintings you will see: the Calling of St. Matthew, the Inspiration of St. Matthew, and the Martyrdom of St. Matthew."

This central located church is famous for there outstanding Caravaggio paintings. it is hard to decide wether the paintings in Santa Maria del Popolo are better or these ones, you have to go to both churches anyway . so you get 6 world class paintings for free , that is nearly free because you have to insert one euro coins to enlight them which is much more than a fair price for these heavenly paintings."

It's the national church in Rome of France. The fa\u00e7ade includes some French statues like Charlemagne, St. Louis, St. Clothilde and St. Jeanne of Valois.The interior contains a series of frescoes from Domenichino's masterful depiction of the \"Histories of Saint Cecilia\". The most famous contributions, however, are the three paintings from Baroque master Caravaggio (1571-1610) in the far left Contarelli Chapel where most of the visitors gather. These somewhat controversial works at the time are about the life of Apostle St. Matthew. The \"Calling of St. Matthew\" dramatizes the moment Jesus and Matthew confront the toll collectors. Check out his trademark light and shadow technique! \"The Martyrdom of St. Matthew\" shows the moment the executioner is forcing him to the ground. \"The Inspiration of St. Matthew\" was also painted between 1598-1601. The other highlight is the frescoed ceiling by French artist Charles-Joseph Natoire."

And the story of Matthew in these three paintings is fantastic. (If you like Caravaggio then you also need to do the Chiesa di San Agostino between here and the Piazza Navona, and then the Basilica di Santa Maria del Popolo on the Piazza del Popolo)But this church is the centre of the French community in Rome, with some art works and monuments worth seeing just to learn a little about this important story - the French in Rome. Moreover, there is an extremely good French bookshop almost next door to the Church, with a good Art history section. It's such a short walk from the Pantheon that it really is a crime to miss this place."

Feel things you've never experienced from a painting: love, fear, dread, horror, hope. Please read about them before you go. Don't go blind and think \"why the funny hat?\" Dedicate a few minutes to some research... and then go. Look. Feel. It will change your life."

The Vocation of Matthew is the most evocative image, showing the future Saint in an everyday setting as the divine light strikes his face. Worth the detour to this church.

San Luigi dei Francesi contains three of the greatest and most influential paintings ever produced in Italy by Carvaggio. The painting on the left, The Calling of St. Matthew, takes place indoors where Saint Matthew, then a finely dressed moneychanger, sits with a group of common types. Jesus has just entered the dark room, raised his arm, and uttered the words \"Follow me,\" (Matthew 9:9). The saint looks up, incredulous with an expression as if to say, \"Who, me?\" The composition contributes to the drama of the scene. A source of light above and behind Jesus' head slashes the darkness and slants down to illuminate the saint's face. As in many of his religious works, Caravaggio's subjects are depicted at the moment of a miraculous event. On the opposite wall hangs The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and the third painting, above the altar, The Inspiration of Saint Matthew, is not the painting Caravaggio originally created for this location."

Several of his contemporaries also have works in this church, and so it makes for an interesting comparison and meditation on how taste changes over the long haul. Truly gorgeous, but what is most interesting is seeing the extent of the contrast between when the paintings are lit and when they are dark. Also, check the hours, as they are not consistent with other churches in Rome."

Opening Hours are 10-12.30pm and 3.30-7pm (as of March 2015). Note that the church remains closed on Thursday afternoons. Within San Luigi dei Francesi you will see a decent nave with an attractive gilded ceiling. The ceiling fresco by French painter Charles-Joseph Natoire is well worth having a look. There are nice chapels on both side aisles of the church, each featuring paintings and frescos that are worth viewing. However, in the end, the main purpose for including a stop at this church is the Caravaggio masterpieces. The Contarelli Chapel is located at the front right side of the church nave. This is where you will find the trio of Caravaggio works. You will probably find a large crowed gathered here as well. Just take you time and you will soon be able to make your way to the front where you can see the masterpieces - 'The Calling of St. Matthew', 'The Inspiration of Saint Matthew' and 'The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew' painted by Caravaggio between 1599-1600. The three paintings are incredible and demonstrate Caravaggio's mastery of light and darkness which evolved into an entirely new style of painting known in later centuries as Caravaggesque style. They are a real treasure that will be easily appreciated by all who have an interest in fine art and seeing the works of Old Masters. Note: There is a coin operated machine at the chapel which can be used to illuminate the masterpieces if you want to take pictures. There is also a small kiosk area in the church, selling bookmarks, postcards and other images of the Caravaggio masterpieces at San Luigi dei Francesi.Note: If you want to see more Caravaggio paintings, consider also visiting Santa Maria del Popolo where there are two more of his masterpieces on display."

It is still in operation for the French community in the area, and houses some absolutely spectacular artwork. Their 'collection' (I say it as such because I don't really consider the church as having a collection, instead having more of a structure of artworks) includes three works by Caravaggio that are among his best. It is well worth a trip to visit this church. Like other churches in the area, it has eccentric opening times to the public, so make sure you plan ahead and are well aware of the hours. The only issue I saw with the church was the \u20ac1 it costs to light any side altar long enough to admire the artworks. You feed your \u20ac1 coin into the little tin box and the lights come on for 45-60 seconds and then go off again. Although there is no cost to visit the church in the first place and \u20ac1 isn't particularly steep, it would cost \u20ac10-12 to light all of the side altars to see each of them, and almost every other church in Rome is free entry, including St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican (not including the well worth it \u20ac5-7 each to go to the top of the dome). The artwork is part of the church. Don't call it free entry to the church if you're going to charge to see something other than darkness. The \u20ac1 for a church still very much in use was quite off-putting, especially as people feed their money into those machines all day, every day. We went in low season, and I don't think one full minute ever passed without someone putting a coin in the Caravaggio altar box. Still, it's a great spot and well worth a visit."

I suggest one takes a little stroll around the church before going to the C chapel to get some sort of context. Once one his seen the Leandro Bassano or the Domenichino wich are great paintings in there own right, one can move on to Caravaggio.

The Caravaggio has to be seen and the alters and sculptures are stunning and a really special place to stop in for a while. You can light a candle here for an offering and there is seating for quiet contemplation. Often large tourist parties or school trips come in and sadly don't observe the silence but do not miss this on your way to Piazza Navone"

The realism of the people in the scenes brings out the emotion of the moment. The saints look like real people with real emotions. Anyway, that's not all there this church has to offer. The marble, the scuptures, especially the one on top of the main entrance door, the chappels....... And, it's right beside the Pantheon. Enjoy!"

On a Sunday morning when Pantheon crowds were just too much, my wife and I wandered just a couple of blocks and ambled into this serendipitous discovery. Fronted by a small square, San Luigi dei Francesi is a small, magnificent find: a stunning triptych by Caravaggio on the left of the main altar, a Raphael hiding elsewhere. But the surprise for us when we wandered in on the Sunday Mass service was hearing the liturgy in French . . . this is the French national Catholic church in Rome. French . . . in the most Italian of cities . . . of course! What a testament to the diversity and vitality of Rome. Put San Luigi on your \"Rome for Locals\" list . . . it is absolutely worth a Sunday visit."

The interior is pure fuel for your soul and joy for all your senses. I'm not into art myself and have difficulties to tell all the artists from each other, but it doesn't prevent me from just enjoying this place. The outer didn't promise much which makes you wonder how different the interior can be. My neck got tired of all the staring at the fantastic frescoes in the ceiling. Being in the church you quickly realize where the most famous paintings are, the three paintings by Caravaggio, as that's where the crowd get stocked. Even me got thrilled by the The Calling of St. Matthew, to see if its the real sun that reflects on the painting through the window or is it's painted!

This church, near to the pantheon holds a real treasure in Caravaggio's remarkable St Matthew paintings which when illuminated by a euro recieving light near the alcove that holds the paintings are really something to behold, However it seems that some people are incapable of 1. obeying the church's simple rules about no photography and keeping silent and 2. looking at the works of art on display other than through an iphone or similar device. Not only is this very annoying to those of us that just want to look with our eyes but it is more importantly very disrespectful to those in the church who wish to sit in the church in silent meditation. This particular group of happy snapping philistines didn't even have the decency to put their phones on silent! It could be argued that an unenforced rule might as well not exist but given that there seemed to only be one man working in the church he really couldn't be expected to be everywhere. I really wish that Caravaggio himself had been there to see the utter disrespect shown to his work and given his prepensity for violence I wouldn't give much for their chances! It seems ridiculous to take a photo of a painting as it will obviously be inferior to the profesionally taken ones available in post card, poster and book versions in the church. So come on selfish snappers, don't spoil what should be should be an amazing experience with your crude attempts at photography, leave it to the experts and try just looking for once."

That way you can walk up to the little chapel at the left side of the alter and view the Caravaggio paintings in peace. This church is known for a couple of things. Most notably, the cycle of three Caravaggio paintings on the life of St Matthew, namely, the Calling of Matthew, the Inspiration of St Matthew and the Martyrdom of St Matthew. It was also where Martin Luther stayed when he came to Rome for his trial, which was held at the church of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva on the other side of the Pantheon. This place gets very crowded due to the Caravaggios and its close proximity to Piazza Navona.The Caravaggio paintings are magnificent and are worth six stars alone but this rating is for the church as a whole. You are allowed to take pictures, but only without the flash. If you have an Iphone you don't need the flash to get your picture. There is no excuse for people to turn theirs on (as so many do). Get there before these people arrive and spoil the atmosphere. You'll need to have the light turned on the get a good photo (1 Euro). There is also a nice ceiling inside the church."

Inside are chapels filled with fine paintings. The most famous are by Caravaggio, the stormy personality who had new ideas about conveying the drama of religious subjects. He often used spotlighting to emphasize the stories, and painted figures who looked like real people rather than versions of ancient Roman statues. He shows the Calling by Jesus of St. Matthew in a basement where Matthew has been hanging out with his disreputable buddies, by illuminating the hand of Jesus calling and by Matthew's hand that seems to be saying \"Are you calling ME?\" But do not neglect the paintings in other chapels, such as those by Domenichino and others."

There are three pictures of the life of St Matthew, one on each of its walls, all by Caravaggio. Just as he planned them with the light coming from the window and painted into the works. They are a little startling - partly because they may have been recently cleaned but show off the dramatic brilliance of the artist wonderfully."

Otherwise, the church is rather beautiful in itself. There is a splendid painted ceiling but the whole is offset with lots of white and gilt decoration. There are some lovely side chapels including a superb one to the Madonna with moulded drapes and a stone angel spearing an unworthy through the throat - very dramatic!

Even if it did not contain the 3 Caravaggio paintings it would still be worthy of witness. The walls and ceilings are covering in gold paint, fabulous stone work and murals of the highest class. To me this compares favourably with much of what you will see in the Vatican, including the Sistine Chapel.If it is the Caravaggio's that draw you in, they are located in a chapel at the front left of the church."

And, standing up, he followed him.In the custom's office painted by the Caravaggio we see two groups of people and we can distinguish them by their clothing. On the left, around Saint Matthew, they are dressed as in the Caravaggio's contemporary fashion period (a very modern and extreme way to represent a classic sacred scene, the same that nowadays we can experience in lyrical operas by the most avantgarde directors!) ; Jesus Christ and Saint Peter on the contrary are dressed as in their time period. In this manner, Caravaggio put the scene out of any historical moment, allowing his contemporaries and us to enter into our own evangelical story.Jesus Christ, lending his hand in the same gesture as Adam in the Michelangelo's fresco of creation, extends God's creation of man into vocation to follow his calling.This same extended hand crosses over the \"emptiness\" which separates the two groups of people, the separation between man and God, human and divine, sin and mercy. This crossover becomes the opening of an alliance between God and men realized by the gift of mercy. With this gesture, Christ has begun a dialogue in which Peter and Matthew both participate.Even the light coming from outside the painting has the meaning of the light of God. We can not see Him but we can see and feel His warm touch.If you pay attention to the simplicity of the shape of window, you can see that it is anticipating Jesus tragic end: the wooden Cross.Even if you are not Christian or religious at all and you will decide to enter this church ONLY to see \u201cThe Saint\u2019s Matthew\u2019s vocation\u201d it will surprise you so much that you will recognize how modern and scandalous Caravaggio was at his time."

I visit this church each time I visit Rome (now around 18 times) and I always marvel again at these stunning works of art. The church is located in a street called Via Santa Giovanna d'Arco. It is not stunning from the outside and you might walk right past it if you are not aware of its location. If you are sightseeing in Rome you will almost certainly go to Piazza Navona at some stage and then want to see the Pantheon and this church is on the way there. If you are in the middle of the Piazza Navona satnding at the magnificent fountain of the four rivers, exit the square by the middle exit to the east. Follow the street to the main road (Corso del Rinascimento) and cross at the pedestrian crossing following the signs for the Pantheon. You continue east along a lane on the other side of the main road and the first street that you come to is your destination. Turn left into the street and the church is on the left. The Carravagios are on the last side chapel (the Contarelli Chapel) on the left before the main altar. To get a good view you have to deposit a coin in a box which activates the lighting but there are so many visitors that this can often be on for long periods. My favourite painting is the oil on canvas called \"The Calling of St. Matthew\" which depicts the moment when Christ calls St Matthew, who was a tax collector, to follow him. The way the artist depits light in the painting is incredible. I have a framed print of this painting on my office wall - I advise people on their tax affairs and if I have a meeting with a tax inspector I like to make sure that he sits where it is in full view. It is such a stunning picture that it often prompts a question from the inspector about what it depicts and I enjoy explaining its significance. If a cheap copy can illicit that sort of attention then imagine what the original is like. If the church happens to be closed when you are there make a return trip. You will be well rewarded for your perseverance."

This one is worth a visit, in my opinion, mostly due to the Carravagio paintings. There are three in a side chapel. You can't go all the way into the middle of the space, but you can see them pretty well from the entrance. There is a pay-to-play lighting, meaning that you can't really see them without donating a euro or so. I have seen this elsewhere in Rome. Some of them are free, and there's a chance this one was. I can't remember. But just be prepared to use a couple of coins. It's well worth it.It's hard to mistake Carravagio. He has a very distinctive and beautiful style. For more, go to the Borghese Gallery (a few smaller ones). There's a lot more to see there too, especially in the sculpture arena."

They are about 5 minutes apart and will give you a glimpse of just why Rome is such a fantastic city: combine the greatest Roman temple with two churches with 17th century Caravaggio masterpieces. It is an easy walk between the 3 sites. Check the opening times of the churches - they close for the noon hour.There is no fee to enter San Luigi but take a few euro coins with you to put in the light machine to illuminate the works of art. Often there is a crowd and other viewers may put a coin in but it is always nice to pay your share of the lighting. (Look for a small box against the back wall of the church by the Contarelli chapel).You may have to wait your turn to get to the front of the railing. I believe you can take photos without a flash, or at least many were taking photos on their phones. There is usually an attendant - especially true of San Luigi -who ensures proper behavior, that is, no talking and wearing appropriate clothing. This church, more than any other, will ask that you cover bare shoulders. Short shorts are not appreciated. There are plenty of restaurants (for traditional Roman dishes, Armando al Pantheon gets good reviews by locals) and little shops in the vicinity and there is a taxi stand not far away (check your map).Travel tip: If you visit during the hot months, stop at the Tazzo d'Oro adjacent to the Pantheon and have one of the city's best frozen coffee drinks, a granita. You will get a clear plastic cup with shaved, sweetened, iced espresso topped with delicious whipped cream (pay at the register first - at far left - and then give the server behind the bar your receipt). Eat this on the portico of the Pantheon and then visit the 2 churches."

Although we do love old churches, and those in Rome are seemingly all amazing, I have to admit that getting some shade was at least part of the reason for visiting!What a lucky fund this turned out to be. The church itself is an old French church in the typical Roman style, and as you can see in the photos is absolutely beautiful. Beautifully decorated ceilings, and wonderful artwork, just typical of most churches in Rome. However, as I walked through, I saw a cluster of people in the bottom left hand corner; naturally this piqued my interest. As I got closer, the lights dimmed and I didn't know what people were looking at. Once someone decided it was up to them to put a Euro \"in the meter\", the art in this small chapel was lit up, revealing the famous Caravaggio paintings. What beautiful, amazing, well maintained decorations these are! They are incredible paintings, beyond words, and really must be seen to be believed. Find your way here; it's just off the Piazza Navona and it's definitely worthwhile."

For those unwilling or unable to spend hours in major galleries hunting for their favourite paintings, this is must-see viewing. Three works of genius placed where they were intended to be, so that the strategy of the painting's composition becomes evident. the rest of the church is pretty spectacular, too--really one of the most enjoyable tourist sites in Rome as it's never over-crowded."

I have visited 569 churches in Rome, which became a passion of mine. There is no better way to understand the history, the art (mosaics, painting, frescoes, sculpure, tapestries, vestments, sacred art), the architecture and the very essence of what Rome is all about. Whether it's bald face politics, wealth gone wild, or simple spirituality, it's all there within the walls of Rome's churches, shrine and chapels (which by my personal count, number more than 1800).I never come to Rome without stopping at San Luigi, and I will do so again four days from now. I am always drawn back by the Caravaggio paintings, each different, each unique, each (as the Italians say) suggestivo. The closest translation I have come across for this word is evocative, but that does not do the word justice. Make a beeline for the painting, in the far left forward chapel from where you enter the church. If no one has paid to turn on the spotlight, don't be a nerd: pay to turn them on. It's worth it. There are excellent signboards behind you with good enough explanations of the art for the casual visitor. If you need more, google the church and you will find plenty to read. Or simply google Caravaggio. I often hold conferences in Rome, and I always conduct a walking tour myself. If the church is open, I take the visitors there, usually after a nice espresso at the nearby Cafe St. Eustacchio. For Caravaggio devotees, I always then take them to the church of San Agostino, also close by, to see my favorite work by this artist: The Madonna of Loreto (or the name I prefer: the Madonna of the Pilgrims). I can gaze at this painting so intently that I can forget to breathe. Once again, pay to put the spotlight on it if others don't. As your eyes move around the painting, and you inevitably linger over the tired Mary holding a very robust baby boy, you feel as if she is carrying the future of the world. And for devout Christians, she was. I can think of no other painting of the madonna (and there are zillions) which captures this so well."

From the outside, you may wonder why you see so many people coming and going into this rather ordinary fa\u00e7ade. The reason is Caravaggio, arguably the most (in)famous painter to ever live and work in Rome. His reputation as a hooligan and troublemaker is only outdone by his talent as an artist. He didn\u2019t produce that many paintings during his short life, but the very best of what he did produce is here (for free) in this church. Don't miss it. Of course, there are many masterpieces by history\u2019s greatest artists scattered throughout this incredible city. But Caravaggio manages to stand out, even among this cast of all-star talent.

It can get very crowded, especially as it has limited opening hours (1000-1230,1600-1900), and you can't actually go into the chapel - you see the paintings on the side walls from an angle.The three paintings are:The Calling of St Matthew (left wall): Matthew the tax-collector is sitting in a dingy room, the setting is the Rome of Caravaggio's own time. Christ enters on the right and points at him. It's not totally clear who Matthew is.St Matthew and the Angel (behind the altar): a younthful angel is dictating the gospel to the elderly Matthew. Matthew is balancing precariously on a stool and looks like he's about to topple over!The Martyrdom of St Matthew (right wall): Matthew is attacked during a Mass service. A very chaotic work, perhaps the least successful of the three. Possibly a self-portrait of Caravaggio, in the background to the left of the supposed assassin."

And on the evening I first visited it in December there was a bright blue peanut shaped balloon clinging to the ceiling right in front of San Luigi! I enjoyed this as I've seen the ceiling many times before, but I imagine the parents of the child who lost it had to return to the Christmas Fair in Piazza Navona around the corner to replace the baloon."

The amazing thing about Rome is that it's like a living museum: it's so modern and sexy and just ROMAN -- but it exists in and around some of the world's most amazing and priceless art. Because of this, you don't ever need to set foot in a museum to see works of art: many great works are just sitting there in churches, in little side chapels. Just sitting there. Not hidden behind glass, not 50 feet away -- just right there in front of you.So it is with this church, which houses 3 very well-known Caravaggios. Even if you've never heard of Caravaggio or you don't know a thing about art, you will recognize these paintings. There's always a small group of in-the-know tourists there during open hours taking a peek and (non-flash) photos of the paintings... you can drop in some coins to activate the lights for a minute or two as well. Make a point of stopping in here and wander over to the side chapel up front, and you'll be amazed at what a Caravaggio looks like in person. Such exquisite painting that it looks like it's somehow illuminated from the inside. It's unbelievable that you're allowed to stand just a few feet away from these masterworks, which have been sitting here for hundreds of years."

You can also see Domenichino\u2019s Histories of Saint Cecilia frescoes, among the works of other Baroque artists.

You can almost hear the saint-to-be saying, \"Who? Me?\"This church can be combined with two others in the area: Santa Maria del Popolo and the Basilica di Sant' Agostino. A good plan would be to start with the Santa Maria in the Piazza del Popolo and walk down toward Piazza Navona to the other two.

The rock star of his era, Caravaggio was by all accounts a bit of a lad, but his paintings are mesmerising. Anywhere else in the world, paintings of this calibre would have top shelf security and cost you a bit to see. Not in Rome. Within 100 metres you can see four Caravaggios for free (take a few euro coins for the light boxes though), not to mention a Raphael and a few other not-too-shabby artists. This church is particularly beautiful. While the other paintings are \"nice\", you'll know when you're looking at Caravaggio's St Matthew's Vocation (3 paintings) - apart from his use of light and shade, he was unique in his inclusion of ordinary people in his scenes. Once you've finished here, head around the corner to Sant' Agostino church to see Caravaggio's \"Madonna di Loreto\" and a Raphael fresco (on a pillar near the rear of the hunch and not easy to spot!). Again free, but take euro coins for the light boxes and be aware the churches close for a few hours in the afternoon. For more Caravaggios, buy a ticket to the gallery at Villa Borghese and also the Capitoline Museum."

It was a lucky find, especially because there seemed to be a special occasion with informative tables about all the paintings. As this is a church that served the city's prominent Frenchmen, it's no surprise that you can find Jean of Arc and other notable figures there.

A few coins in the light box and you will hear a collective gasp as the magnificent paintings are illuminated. Save time and effort queuing for expensive and crowded museums and instead spend some time in this cool, relaxing and free oasis. Bear in mind that like most churches in Rome is closes for a few hours during lunch time (think its 12:30-15:00 in this case).

Given that it's in Rome this church is pretty \u00a0unremarkable, strange that it scores as \"no. 1 attraction.\"This is due of course to three paintings of Caravaggio. \u00a0The artist was certainly a most unpleasant man in real life. But it's his art that's in question so we can put aside his violent nature.\u00a0As an artist anatomy is Caravaggio's weak point; he gets this badly wrong often.\u00a0That said, everything else about the work is fascinating. It's place in western art and thinking undoubted.\u00a0It is wonderful to find a set of three works presented as the artist intended. There's a rare authenticity about this. That the setting is less than ideal is a side point, we can take it the patrons commissioning the works didn't fully realise how important they were to be.Of the three \"the calling of saint Matthew\" is my favourite. Having often looked at reproductions i was very disappointed that when I eventually found time to sit in front of the original masterpiece (it is a masterpiece as I understand the word to mean) the light had to be fed euros every few minutes to keep it on - this was really irritating.\u00a0As I studied the group of tax collectors trying to finally decide for myself if Matthew is pointing to himself or if he is in fact the \u00a0young guy with bowed head the light kept going off- hungry for coins.\u00a0On balance, \u00a0this is worth seeing but in no way is at as fulfilling or important an experience as its rating \u00a0here might suggest. Caravaggio just isn't that rewarding despite the current fashion in lauding him.\u00a0\u00a0"

In this Church, there are 3. They are contained in a small alcove so they are easy to find. Look for the alcove with lots of people. If you get there and find the alcove dark, drop a Euro in the box for some light or wait til someone else does. Since the 2 large paintings are on the flanking walls, it is impossible to get a great photo so don't waste the time and just buy the postcards. Enjoy the play of light through the windows in the Church and how this same angle is replicated in the paintings themselves. A little appreciated detail highlighted by my art loving daughter. There are posters located throughout the church that point out the highlights of the Caravaggio paintings, so it is worth wandering around to the rest of the church too."

It is also across the street from the Italian senate. They had some interesting things in their windows. As for the church, it is the national church of France in Rome, so a lot of the stuff inside is in French. Not to mention the beautiful Caravaggio paintings within! There are also frescos and other pieces of artwork that are well worth a visit. I highly recommend this church!"

Opposite is the drama of St Matthew's matyrdom, whilst the \"face on\" centre piece is the calmer \"Inpsiration of St Matthew\". I was unprepared for the way the light came out of the painting. The other tourists and visitors crowding round to view the painting seemed to become part of the tableau. The hand of Jesus (or is it the hand of Michelangelo's Adam?) points at St Matthew....but we become part of the grimy scene. Bathed in the light of divine love, we also ask \"who me?\""

Even better, you can see them free of charge--just bring a few Euro coins to operate the lamps to see the paintings better, and you may want to make a small donation to the church itself. The incredibly moving (and personal to Caravaggio--the priceless look on Matthew's face capturing his indecision and struggle about whether he should renounce his dissolute life and follow Jesus out the door recalls the painter's own extremely turbulent personal life) \"Calling of St. Matthew\" is probably my favorite painting of all-time, the gut-wrenching 'martyrdom of St Matthew', and the humourous 'St Matthew and the Angel\" are also enchanting.
