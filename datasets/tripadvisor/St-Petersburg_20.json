It provided a handy landmark for us as it was just a few minutes' walk away from our hotel, and leads on to Nevsky Prospekt. It's also where one finds the ticket office & starting point for the (at time of writing) only English language boat trip along the canals - which is well worth doing."

            "review": "A river runs under it. Anichkov Bridge is Petersburg\u2019s oldest and most famous bridge, which crosses Fontanka Canal/River. It is an essential element of Nevsky Prospekt, a major artery similar to Andrassy in Budapest. Originally constructed in 1715 (61 years before the American Revolution, and 168 years before Brooklyn Bridge), Peter the Great ordered its construction and named it after engineer Mikhail Anichkov. Nothing remains of that incarnation, and the current bridge was built in 1841, reconstructed in 1906. The four famous horse sculptures were added in 1849, and Anichkov Bridge has the most celebrated ornate iron railings in Petersburg. Anichkov Bridge is mentioned in the works of Dostoevsky, Pushkin, and Gogol. For those who think it\u2019s just a bridge, consider the historic ramification here, and for Charles Bridge in Prague. Besides, Faberge Museum is a block away. Without this bridge, visitors would have to walk miles to experience such attractions as Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, Hermitage & Winter Palace, and a host of other historic attractions just beyond Anichkov Bridge. But I enjoyed it for the attraction it is. It is the iconic bridge of Petersburg, and is featured in paintings. For those like me, who are travel budget challenged, there is no cost, so why not enjoy? Perhaps this is why it's TripAdvisor rated #20 of 1,662 Things To Do in Petersburg."

The Horse Tamers on every corner of the bridge give it a regal appearance. The horses were removed from the Academy of Arts building as they were replaced by Egyptian sphinxes when someone got the idea to relocate the horses to Nevsky Prospekt. Two were placed on the west side of the bridge and in 1851 two more sculptures were installed. Just north of the bridge a gilded coat of arms stands above the central wrought iron gates of the Sheremetev Palace."

And always, again and again we admired to its elegant features and lines. Thinking only of, how it started with the wooden construction in 1715 -1716, ordered by Peter the Great, and named after its engineer, Mikhail Anichkov. Then developped into the three-span stone drawbridge with the most celebrated ornate iron railings in Sankt Petersburg.And of course, here there are the four wonderful horse sculptures, that became one of the Sankt Petersburg landmarks.Amazing !"

If you prefer walking in St.Petersburg, which is definitely a smart choice to experience this city, you are bound to cross Anichkov Bridge at least once. The four statues on the corners attract many tourists by a silly legend that the emperor's face was secretly portrayed in a place highly inappropriate for royalty, and many groups go around the four horsemen closely examining the hind legs of the horses.

The boat played an on-board commentary in Russian but fortunately we had our English language guide Valentina sitting with us so we got the translated version face-to-face, essential to an understanding of all the significant buildings & bridges we passed. Our boat was a flat top type, the importance of which was illustrated when we passed under bridges as low as 2.4m (many were 2.5m) - standing up was not recommended - for health reasons! The crew member on our boat at one point nonshalantly ducked his head at the last moment to avoid get it taken off. We figured we knew what he was doing & was just 'showboating' to impress the punters. Cruising the open Neva afforded good views of the impressive Peter and Paul Fortress in the river island. In the boat the canals (Fontanya, Moiky, Gribeodova) afforded good views of many of the city's best buildings."

Once the 872 day siege was lifted, the horses were dug up and replaced on their respective plinths. I like the fact that one of the plinths (with the tamed horse) still shows its battle scars."

The tour is very well guided and organized, includes a stop for hot meal at authentic Russian restaurant with good quality food."

The whole bridge is a work of art! Don't jus walk over it - enjoy! I only discovered later that they are called the Horse Tamers."

As bridges go, it's nothing special, but, the statuary and railings that decorate it are very beautiful, well worth taking some time to study them.From Wikipedia:The Horse Tamers The Horse Tamers, designed by the Russian sculptor, Baron Peter Klodt von Jurgensburg. They rank among the city's most recognizable landmarks. The theme derives from the colossal Roman marbles, often identified with the Dioscuri, prominently sited on the Quirinal Hill, Rome. Guillaume Coustou's baroque marble horse tamers for Marly-le-Roi, the Chevaux de Marly, were resited at the opening to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Paris, at the Revolution. The St Petersburg sculptures have an interesting history. Prior to 1851, when the definitive versions were installed in the bridge, Tsar Nicholas I had given two of them to Prussian King Frederick William IV in 1842, and the other two had been sent in 1846 to Naples as a sign of gratitude for the hospitality shown to the Tsar during his trip there (see here and here). \"Petersburg lore tells of Peter Klodt's death immediately upon embarrassing discovery that tongues had been omitted on two of the four sculptural horses\"[2]. Another urban legend has it that Klodt depicted his powerful enemy's face under the tail of one of the bronze stallions. In 1941, during the Second World War, when the bridge came under heavy fire from German artillery, the sculptures were removed from their platforms and buried in the nearby Anichkov Palace garden. The bridge suffered serious damage during the war, but has been fully restored. As a memorial, the pedestal of one of the statues retains the effects of artillery fire, with a plaque explaining this to passersby. Prior to the tercentenary of Saint Petersburg, the statues were removed from the bridge again and underwent thorough restoration."

In a city of well over 300 bridges, the Anichkov bridge is worth a visit to see the beautiful horse sculptures at each end, and admire the view from the bridge, which anchors one end of the most visited part of Nevsky Prospect. It's worth starting here with the oldest bridge across the Fontanka before walking up to the Admiralty/Winter Palace at the other end of the major street.The bridge is quite lovely, of course, but we stopped because of the story associated with it -- the sculptor, annoyed with continued demands from the tsar and the workload, carved the face of his patron in the groin of one of the horses. Probably an urban legend, of course, but it certainly had us peering quite rudely at the statues!"

The Anichkov bridge is famous for for groups of horse tamers in its corners - all different and sometimes they say that they feature 4 stages of taming of a horse by a man. All the statues were made after models and cast by Russian sculptor baron Peter Clodt. The present design is not the genuine. For the first version baron cast 2 identical couples (one of them is still in its place in the western side, closer to the Admiralty) - but due to their high artistic quality tsar Nicholas I presented one couple to the king of Naples (where they can be seen nowadays near the Royal palace). The sculptor repeated the couple - which was later presented to the king of Prussia. Then the sculptor getting tired of repeating himself produced 2 new groups now decorating the eastern side of the bridge. Their main difference from the first groups is in lack of horseshoes. After the recent cleaning all the groups which were hidden during the Siege in 1941-44 in a nearby garden look brand new."
