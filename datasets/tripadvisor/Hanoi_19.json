Downside was story is virtually impossible to follow as was entirely in Vietnamese .... which would be fine if there was a program in English or other languages that we could see, to help with the concepts and our engagement with the show. Maybe there are programs or sheets available to buy, but if so they are not made obvious."

We still had an unobstructed view.The show started with some traditional songs before the main event. I liked that they reenacted myths and legends of Vietnam. They had some cute special effects like fireworks. The narration needs a little work as the local pronunciation was sometimes difficult to understand.I think the kids would enjoy the spectacle. Go early to get better seats. I have only seen one other water puppet show and it was pretty similar so I think it's a touristy thing to do at shops surrounding hoan kiem lake."

We and our 9-year-old loved this show, which runs for just under an hour several times a day in the afternoon and evening, right next to Hoan Kiem Lake (lovely to walk around in the evening). It was all in Vietnamese but that didn't matter - a beautiful spectacle and story, with high quality local music throughout. A nice cool rest from walking around in the heat! Book tickets in advance (same day is fine) as it's very popular. The caf\u00e9 at the bottom is convenient but expensive."

The accompanying music is excellent too and the puppets themselves are beautifully made. My only criticism is the everyone in the row has to stand up for others coming into their row. I also think they should stop people taking photos or videoing. I had an iPad in my line of vision for almost the whole performance."

Interesting and a cultural experience with its live musicians playing along the acts and scenes.However the inside is a bit old. The outside is too small and there is no waiting area. There are only a few seats beside the stairs. There are more seats in the restaurant further inside where you need to drink or eat. It will be good if more seats are available for those waitng for the next shows which is 45 minutes away."

I was wondering when and if I would see an event that captured Hanoi. The water puppets did for me. The story is old, the delivery is childlike and simple, and the live music is delivered with great respect and purpose. Ask for a seat nearest the front to take the full effect, and reflect in the knowledge that you are watching a style of entertainment that is many centuries old. It's only an hour. See it early in your trip, and it will help with perspective."

The price of ticket is reasonable at 100,000 VND per pax. I opted for the last show on Sun which is bout 8pm. Pokemon craze is in town as there are several Pikachus posing in front of the theater to draw in crowd. Gimmicks aside, I felt appreciative of the effort to conserve tradition in face of modern currents. It is definitely not an easy task to manipulate puppets under the water. The show itself is mainly in Vietnamese, slight English in introduction . Would be helpful for greater appreciation of the show if you go in with slight understanding of storyline or belief such as the 4 mythical creatures and the legend of the returning sword. I was most impressed on the opening part where a lady performed with the one stringed harp. Do go in with an open mind and appreciation of culture. It may not be fancy stunts or massive pyrotechnic but it is a beautiful experience. Note : 1. The venue is not air conditioned but with lots of fan . 2. No - you will not get wet, no water is splashed on the audience =)3. For friends of technology, please be respectful and not perpetually put out your phones to take photos or record and thereby obstructing the view of audience behind."

Grab a leaflet explaining the different facets of each 'puppet act' just near the theatre entrance (inside the building). Doesn't really matter if you don't get one beforehand though as you can generally work it out for yourself. Seating arrangements can be tricky if you attempt to get a ticket at the last minute; so sometimes good to book earlier in the day. Three shows a night, so plenty of options. Cheap entertainment!"

My only problem: phones are not restricted in the audience. A woman in the second row filmed the entire show on her iPhone. This led to people behind her having trouble seeing and that led them to sit up causing the people behind them to have trouble seeing, etc. etc. The show itself was lovely. But, if you get stuck behind the wrong person, then you're in for trouble, because the puppets are very low to the ground."

There was a bit with pyrotechnics which everyone loved. Most of the stories didn't need translation as it was entertaining enough without needing to understand the speaking bits, but for others, we would have liked to see subtitles to make it more meaningful. We did receive a paper with a summary of the show but a more detailed narrative would have been nice. Language aside, the music was nice and the puppets and movement of them was very well done. If you have sensitive ears, consider bringing ear plugs (I had a headache and the high pitched notes hurt so I put in ear plugs and enjoyed the show much more)."

Really enjoyed it and had a great time. Although it was in Vietnamese the show was entertaining and funny. The tickets were not expensive and I would advise that you book early so you get allocated a seat near the front. The most annoying thing is when people take pictures during the show. Why? "

It's one of those must-do things in Hanoi and at only $100,000 Dong for a ticket it's rude not to! We bought tickets in a group early in the day and we're glad we did - when we got there for the 5:20pm show the place was packed. You're also seated according to your tickets, so buy them together if you want to sit together. I took my fan in with me and was glad I did because it can get quite hot in there with so many people. The show lasts around 50 minutes. A definite cultural experience - beautiful music and singing too."

The tickets cost 100.000 dong per person. And as far as I can remember, there is show on every hour, with the last one being at 8pm. The show itself is delightful. It is in Vietnamese but you can guess the storyline. The way the puppets are made and manipulated on stage really makes them come alive. The show lasted about 50 mins. And it is accompanied by live music."

My 12 year old was a little more forgiving but said this was not something that he enjoyed. There was applause after the first one or two performances then it died completely when people realised how boring it really was. Half of the row in front of us was people playing on their phones to keep entertained.If this show was 15 minutes long it might be good. At 50 minutes it is painful. The only plus is that it cost only about 5 bucks each to see it. That's 5 bucks and 50 minutes of my life that I will never get back."

Ticket prices are cheap at 100k VND per adult, with shows running every 70 minutes, the show itself is 50 minutes long and is in a cool room but not air conditioned. This is our first time seeing a water puppet show having never come across one before. Certainly unique although my better half kept nodding off but thats probably due to jet lag! They have creative ways to make use of the puppetry but without spoiling the show I can't say much more. There is a live musical group with native instruments on the left hand side of the stage which was also interesting to see in action. Overall, a unique experience and popular with tourists. Be warned though that the story itself is told in Vietnamese. You can pick up a flyer in English which gives the title to each act though but would be nice if they included the story of what's actually happening!"

The theatre is just across the road from the Lake so easy to access but the traffic near there can be quite hazardous. My one reservation is the amount of leg room in the seats which row by row are far too close together unless you manage to get a VIP seat on the front row! Its a good idea to combine a twilight show at the theatre with a stroll around the lake beforehand followed by dinner in the old town which is just a 5/10 minute stroll away."

If you are in Hanoi then you must see a show here!The show lasts around 50 minutes and there is a schedule in English so you understand what each individual performance is about. There are a few spoken exchanges in Vietnamese but nothing you really need to know. It is easy to follow what is going on. The music is a great accompaniment and the puppets are beautifully decorated. The whole show is a really good experience of Vietnamese culture and we really enjoyed it.The only thing which spoiled it for us was not the fault of the company. A Chinese group tour behind us took up two rows and they were talking throughout the performance. They were very rude and ignorant of other visitors."

The show is performed to live music which is nice, the words however are not in English so can get a little hard to follow.The theatre is quite small, but there are plenty of shows on each day.

Once the puppets themselves started, everyone started sitting forward to get a better view. This meant that the people behind saw less. What I did see though was amazing...you might say mesmerising and if the theatre could fix the gradient of the seats, it would be well worth it, in my opinion. Be sure to pick up an information sheet before you go in (lots of different languages available) so you know what's going on...if you can see it all of course. The other thing that would enhance the experience is if they could ban flash photography as it was constant and really annoying!"

In 5 minutes, we were sitted happily in the back rows. We saw a tour group arguing that their seats were taken, etc, etc. They were standing around being annoying. Bet they paid more than us. Ours were totally hassle free. It was a one hour show, very entertaining, you can pretty much work out each separate simple sketch story along with the music nuances.

The theatre is quite well kept, air conditioned and the seats are numbered and very comfortable. There is a small restaurant at the ground floor, if you want to grab something to eat quickly before the show begins. There are restrooms as well. The show is very well put together. There are some very talented artistes who are part of the show. As this is something that tourists are not used to seeing everywhere they get quite excited. It might be better if they restricted clicking photographs, because half the time people are getting up and clicking pictures, or the flash from a dozen cameras spoil the lighting effect of the show. It is quite interesting, and it is amazing how the artistes have tried to explore various approaches, story lines, plot-twists and characters to make it engaging. Kudos to the team. But I do think the show can be shortened a little bit."

Live music on traditional instruments accompanies the puppets and is itself top notch. It is a must see event. Get tickets early as shows are sold out."

It's really nice to see a traditional art form being preserved so well. From rice farming to fishing to dancing and sea monsters, each vignette is accompanied by traditional music, lighting and special effects. The puppets are beautiful creations, and we really enjoyed trying to figure out how they could synchronize arm movements and other movements. The show is about 50 minutes long, which is a good amount of time. There are several performances, but if you can book your tickets early you will have a better chance for a seat close to the stage. At 100,000 dong, it's a good value.The theatre is located at one end of Hoan Kiem Lake, so easy to navigate to and there are lots of coffee shops nearby for a pre or post show refreshment."

Best to book at least 24 hours in advance to get the showtime you want and the seats you want. Just turn up a day or two before and book.

The narrator only speaks in Vietnamese, but you can pretty much get the jist of most of the acts by watching the puppets.

Still, there\u2019s no doubt that the puppet masters are highly skilled. Accompanied by singing and music. A nice overall experience.

The manager said that we would have to buy at least six other tickets for our group of nine in order to get in EVEN THOUGH the previous woman said that she remembered us buying the tickets. We even remembered the places that she sat us in. Of course, I realized that we were at fault for losing the tickets, but that was only about an hour prior, and I do not see how it makes sense for the manager to not let us in if her employee told her that it was indeed us who bought the nine tickets. We pleaded to the manager to let us in, since there were nine empty seats for us and it would not benefit them to turn us away (this was about 15 minutes into the show). She told us that there was more than 20 empty seats and that she would not let us in regardless. She asked if we were students and I said yes. She then said that as students, we must understand that tickets are needed. If you get want to get on an airplane and lose your ticket, you will not be allowed to get on an airplane. First of all, this is such a ridiculous statement. Second of all, I understand her needing of a ticket for people in general. But we were a group of nine students who already paid 900,000 dong to a woman who backed us up. Even with our pleading, she would not let us in. I found this to be infuriating. It was obvious that the manager only wanted more money for something that we already paid for, which was ridiculous. I even spoke to her in Vietnamese, so it's not like there was a language barrier between us. After our group became so frustrated with listening to her unreasonable no's, we walked out of the theatre. The doors were open and she stood there, laughing at us.

The saleslady was wonderful and we went to dinner.An hour and a half later, after dinner, I realised I had lost the tickets. After calling the restaurant and going back to make sure that I hadn't left them there, my friend and I went with 7 other people to the puppet theatre to see if they could do anything.The manager there was incredibly insulting, rude and conniving. Despite the saleslady being perfectly willing to let us in, and remembering that she had not only sold us the tickets but chosen our seating for us, the manager refused to let us in without buying a minimum of six more tickets. Corruption? Where was the money going to go?Although I own that it was my fault that I had lost the tickets, I can't get over how rude the manager was to demand that we either buy a minimum of six more tickets, or leave. The saleslady remembered us clearly and was telling her to let us in, knowing that we had bought the tickets, and yet the manager still wanted to squeeze more money out of us. As university students, this trip was supposed to be a fun, cultural experience. Instead, we became extremely frustrated with the terrible customer service by the night manager. None of us felt that it was right to pay for tickets that us, the manager and the saleslady knew that we had already rightfully paid for and what was worse was that the manager had the gall to laugh at us as we left. As students, we also didn't have the means to pay again.This was the most frustrating service experience I have ever had. I am extremely disappointed that I was not able to go visit the theatre, even having paid for the experience, and I do not believe that the manager should be dealing with tourists. Yes, it was my fault that I lost the tickets. But with everyone involved knowing that I had paid for them, and exactly which seats were ours, the way the manager behaved was unforgivable and she was coarse, abusive and just downright mean."

I said hello in Vietnamese and she continued to show her friend pictures on her phone. My OH and I waited and she only served me when I turned to walk away. I continued to be very pleasant and I asked for two tickets for the 16:10 showing (we were buying about 2:30 so already had a bit of a wait). All she said was \"No!\" and pointed to the time of the next showing. I asked again if there were tickets for the earlier showing and she just kept saying no. I then said ok thanks any way and walked away. Then, she bangs on the counter, tells us to come back and gives us the two tickets for the earlier showing!! No explanation given and I was feeling a bit scunnered (excuse my Scots) at this point and we weren't really looking forward to performance.However, the performance, although solely in Vietnamese, was gorgeous and the band were extremely talented too. I would say that they could improve this show further by offering an English synopsis of what each performance is about (there are 14 in total) instead of just a title. There's a fair bit of dialogue/singing that you can't follow. Would recommend checking it out of you're in Hanoi - just beware of rude staff."

I understand from local guides that water puppetry is a folk performing art of rice farmers dating back at least 1,000 years. The peasants used to entertain one another and the community during the raining/flooding season with this puppetry and music. It is a celebration of rice harvest. The water is the stage. The puppeteers are waist deep in water, hidden behind a screen. Each puppet weighs up to 30 lbs. and is controlled by sticks and strings from above (making it marionette to be precise). The puppeteers can make puppets perform amazing feats, such as turning, flipping, fighting, or even fire-breathing. The puppet characters include, men, women, kids, water buffaloes (popular with rice farmers), turtles (popular in Vietnamese folk legend), dragons (signifying royalty). \"Chu Teo\" is their equivalence of our Late Night comedian - the main story telling jester. He provides political and social satirical commentary, especially on officials' corruption. The musicians, numbering around 8-10, sit on the side. Instrumentation includes wooden bell, bamboo flutes, drums, cymbals, and gongs. There is vocal accompaniment as well and sung in a very typical Vietnamese nasal sound. It is a form of Vietnamese opera from the north. Singers sing songs that tell the story and interact with the puppets. Unless you do some reading up beforehand or hear it from a guide, I can see why most non-Vietnamese speakers have no clue as to what is happening - not that different from going to a western opera without knowing any Italian or French. I can see many things the performance company can do to better connect and educate non-Vietnamese speaking audience. Maybe a short intro at the beginning, printing more background information in the program, or even translation projection (supertitle). But then the cost will go up."

I would have been hesitant about going here for myself - maybe if there was a wet afternoon or evening however as I was travelling with my 3 and a half year old daughter it was a must.... She was mesmerised by the puppets, the musicians and the performance in general. We have a fabulous photo of her with the eyes popping out of her head how these characters are moving so quickly across the water in front of her.I did enjoy it - it felt like a slice of culture but in each to digest pieces.We had seats near the front and towards the middle - I would go for these rather than further back as despite the potential of a few splashes the experience of being so close makes the performance more impressive."

The show has around 15 acts but after you have seen two they become a bit redundant. It is not very exciting and the music and dark room lulls one to sleep. In fact 3 of the 4 of us drifted off at some point and so did many others around us. It is definitely something you could pass on and not feel too bad about it.They perform every couple hours throughout the day."

To be clear, I haven't been to the water puppet but I want to post this review for all the coming people who are going to visit the water puppet in the future.Today, I have chosen to do the Hanoi free tour with a local student. And during that tour, he brought us to a caf\u00e9 for locals but from now on, it will also be visited by some tourists with this review, I hope.First, the place is located only 100m from de water puppet show.It's on Dinh Tien Hoang at the number 13.If you plan doesn't show the street, when you are facing the water puppet building, make a left and follow the road which goes along the lake. That's the Dinh Tien Hoang street.At the number 13, you'll see a shop selling bags. The caf\u00e9 is on the first floor.You go through a corridor, than, you go up by some stairs.At the first floor, it's pretty weird. And after a hall, you reach a little caf\u00e9 with mainly (if not only) locals.And what's the specialty of the place?The best egg coffee in Hanoi.Besides, for the price of 15.000 vnd (0,60\u20ac).In other places, it's the triple said my guide for a lower quality.Before tasting, I said to him that drinking egg coffee in a weird combination. It's just like combining chocolate and mustard.I like eggs and coffee but I was reluctant to take them at the same time...But I had already read that some tourists already had tried and were rather satisfied, so, I gave it a try.What was my impression?It was suprisingly very good. I gave it a 9 out of 10.Actually, it first looked like capuccino.When I took some with your spoon, it was pretty thik and more solid than liquid.And when I tasted it, I had the impression that I was eating a dessert!I have to tell that the whole egg had been wipped and that I couldn't tell that an egg was inside.There was some sugar which gave a sweet taste to the 'thing'. Actually, if they had reduced the quantity of sugar, I even would have given a 10 out of 10 for this experience.Indeed, the place was not especially nice but is local which is also very important to my eyes.You don't go there for the atmosphere but for a new experience.Glasses of water are for free. That would be a good idea to have one with your egg coffee in case you find the egg coffee a little too sweet.If you are open, just like me to discoveries, you can order a glass of white a liquid looking like milk. The guide couldn't translate in English what it was but after tasting his, we have ordered another for us.I'm wandering if it's not made out of potatoes."

They also feature short sequences that didn't interact with each other, so a bit boring (a fisherman is fishing....fishing...and fishing) I appreciate the music and conversation done in it more, because they are done live, not a recording.

There was a few unique cafes around that area that you could chill. I went to HN time located at the first floor. The caf\u00e9 was quite unique and we actually spent more than 1 hour there just to chill around and watching people walking and car passing by downstairs.

Real live entertainment with the puppeteers, singers, musicians and commentator. Clever production and represents great value at just $5.The show runs frequently throughout the day and evening and is suitable for all ages. Ideal entertainment for a rainy day. My wife videoed the show and her students back home loved it as much as the kids did at the actual live perforamance.Highly recommended."

Showing English subtitles somewhere would have allowed us to appreciate the show more & I feel that the accompanying music could have been more lively & generally less melancholy sounding, but that is what I understand older Viet music to sound like. If i was a Vietnamese farmer, I'd probably be sad most of the time too. A definite recommend. Just remember to bring a fan or something to fan yourself with.

I didn't understand how they were making everything move the way they did, it was great. It's good to not always understand what's happening because then it's more impressive.It's in Vietnamese but it's mostly singing and music. There's not actually that much speech so you can follow along if you don't speak Vietnamese at all, it's mostly physical storytelling. They incorporate pyrotechnics, smoke, and water splashing and each of the stories are really cute and simple. Knowing it was in Vietnamese, I didn't think I'd stay the whole time to be honest, but I did and I was entertained throughout. It proved to be a nice after-dinner activity on a Friday night - one that would not be had anywhere else!Look, you're going to go to plenty of restaurants, see a few museums, and go to several shops on you're trip; the water puppet show will be a fun and unique experience for you that you're guaranteed to remember. 5 USD admission for 8pm show on a Friday night, air conditioned theatre with assigned seats that all have full view."

The puppets themselves are quite intricate and their choreography is cool.A series of skits was performed, each with a separate story. The show was entirely in Vietnamese, but the skits were easy enough to understand.The skits are great, but get a little repetitive towards the end. Luckily, the show finished before I got bored.I don't think this show is suitable for non-Vietnamese children under 6 years old. The combination of somewhat-creepy puppets, loud noises and music, flashing lights, sparks, and Vietnamese singing/talking seemed a bit overwhelming for some young children.Overall a fun way to spend an hour in Hanoi!"

The show itself is super fun, although not in english, but it doesn't even matter because of how great the visuals and music is! If you can, by tickets a few days ahead to get closer seats. The closer the row the better! If not, you will be trying to look through a bunch of heads to get a clear view."

The show is quite eccentric - almost hallucinogenic, and all the better for it :-)One idea for the theatre owners - why not say at the start that people shouldn't have their phones out recording. We had to move seats as we had four people in front of us all recording on their phones - we couldn't see a thing! One stupid guy stupid in the aisle and recorded the WHOLE show!

A cultural must-do, an evening of art and entertainment\u2026 so they say. In our opinion it was a bizarre, super strange, surreal experience. Everything about it was just odd. The story throughout was told in Vietnamese but basically consisted of puppet farmers trying to catch puppet fish. Again. And again. And again. Sometimes there was fire. Sometimes there was comedy. It didn\u2019t take very long for the whole performance to become extremely repetitive. The same routine, same jokes and same god-damn actions.You really could take it or leave it- there\u2019s not much else to say. We turned up without a ticket and at 100,000 Dong it\u2019s really inexpensive. It was raining outside and killed 40 minutes but actually I wouldn\u2019t really recommend it. The venue was very well run and the puppeteers and musicians are clearly talented but it just wasn't our idea of entertainment at all - Sorry Vietnam! After this we went to Dominos and waited 15 minutes for a pizza- on reflection this was probably more entertaining than the show."

The singing and music played on many traditional instruments was a beautiful accompaniment to a simple traditional story that was both symbolic and often humorous.

The price is reasonable if you buy (versus a 3rd party person buying for you). If you have someone sitting in front of you who is always taking pictures or videos on their phone, then that is a problem in you seeing, especially when you have children who are trying to see. (We had that happen.) There is a live orchestra and people who sing during the performance telling the story. If you do not speak Vietnamese, you must get a paper before entering the theatre which will tell you what each performance is and a little about the show in English. The show lasts about 45-50 minutes. Young children (under 3 years or so) may not be able to enjoy the show (especially if they can't see well), but children like ours (7+) found it fascinating."

The live music and general quality of the show was very good. Even though, all the narration is in the local language, the story told with the puppets is very clear. I personally enjoy performance arts, so this was a very good experience for me. It's interesting how all the movement is managed so well in spite of the water. The show is just an hour long, so if you're looking for some quick, local entertainment, this is a nice change!"

Had live commentary with music. Seats were comfortable. Usually the show is full so try booking 12 hours in advance. There are 4-5 shows everyday and the last one at 8 pm is usually in higher demand."

The puppeteers are very skilled, coordinating the puppet movement so well from behind screens while waist high in water themselves. We wonder if the same puppeteers do all of the daily shows?? And if so, do they have skin issues from being in water so much, or maybe they have protective clothing underneath their outfits? Interesting job to say the least!The puppets sometimes had candles or sparklers and the lights were well done. The puppets am were accompanied by musicians, percussionists and vocalists who sang alongside and spoke with the characters (puppets) in the play."

It is incredibly skillful and the Thang Long Puppet theatre artists have been performing in many parts of the world for over a quarter of a century. It is a traditional re-enactment of rural life in Vietnam that was begun over 1,000 years ago, and features such acts as swimming contests, dragon dancing, fishing, catching frogs, as well as Le Loi returning the precious sword. The performance is introduced with a folk music composition on traditional musical instruments, and is then followed by 14 items selected from a repertoire of some 400 items of the ancient Vietnamese puppetry. The whole performance lasts 40 minutes and takes place at the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre at 57B Dinh Tien Hoang Street. Admission is 100,000 dong and there is an additional 20,000 dong fee for taking photos, although this does not seem to be strictly enforced. It is advisable to purchase tickets earlier in the day at certain times of the year, as the theatre does get very full. An absolute \"must see\" whilst on Hanoi."

They seem to very in to the show and give it 100% - very difficult to do in a theater half full.It would be a good idea to have a program printed - even if it was to buy in additional to the tickets giving you more history and the story but otherwise just rest and experience the show.Worth going to but do not worry if you miss it."

The duration of the show is 50 minutes and there are 4 to 6 performances daily but as it is well patronised, it is best to book well ahead by visiting the box office personally during the hours of 8.30 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. as performances are often sold out well ahead. Although the commentary is in Vietnamese, the repertoire which consists of 14 items is visual and thus explanation is hardly required. The performance is slick and professional with one act leading straight to the next. The puppets are colourfully dressed and often perform acrobatic movements on or under the water and sometimes in the air. Around 10 puppeteers are involved, accompanied by a small orchestra playing local instruments and 3 to 4 ladies singing or acting as narrators of the puppets voices. An imaginative production well worth seeing once. The only drawback is that a few audience members who chose to video much of the action with total disregard to other members of the audience. Entrance fee VD100,000."

But I do find that the show is slightly repetitive for the stories they presents, also the plots weren't very captive. I am also a bit disappointed that the show does not have any English subtitles (but that is the general setting in Vietnam, very few people speak English).There are many review saying that booking in advance is recommended but my personal experience showed that same day booking was fine. I booked my ticket 2pm in the afternoon for show at 6.30pm on Sunday. Ticket price was VND100,000 (as of Apr 2016)."

We couldn't wait to attend this ancient and traditional water puppet show that dates back to the 11th century!Originally performed in rice paddies, a pagoda would have been erected as a stage to hide the puppet masters who stand in a waist deep pool. The water creates wonderful acoustics for the live orchestra and singers who are all dressed in native costumes!The puppets are made of wood and painted in lacquer, my favourite being the fire-breathing dragons! It is quite spectacular and this art form is totally unique to North Vietnam and the Red Delta River area.The stories or skits are based on folklore, handed down from generation to generation and tells tales of the rice harvest, festivals, fishing and life in general of a farming people. It would be worthwhile to learn some of the legends and tales of which they tell before you attend one of the shows, as it is difficult to understand what some of the skits are about unless you speak Vietnamese. But even if you don\u2019t, it is an entertaining and pleasurable 35-45 minutes way to amuse yourself.I recommend you book your tickets at least one day in advance if not sooner, as the shows sell out very quickly from morning until night!Adults, children, young and old will find this a truly unique experience. The puppets are enchanting and the puppet masters are a talent unto themselves!Enjoy!"

Trying to figure out how they did it and enjoying the impressive story telling. Yes it's in Vietnamese but that really doesn't matter. Most of the stories told don't even have talking. Not knowing what they were saying did not detract from the enjoyment. Temperature wise it was not as bad as some reviews made out and I don't handle heat well! If you can get seats at the end of an aisle you will be near the fans though."

It was a good price and a good length show.It's set inside a nice theatre and I did no research beforehand so did not know what to expect. I imagined puppets on strings and was very impressed with how the show was done, very clever. Although the show is in Vietnamese you can understand what's going go visually only missing out on a few jokes. I would recommend buying tickets the morning or day before as one show sold out and we had to go the following night. There are only two shows daily so if you have an older lonely planet ignore the times in there. If seeing other people taking photos bothers you ask for tickets near the front although you get a good view of the puppets from anywhere you will have a better view of the band from the right hand side."

We were able to book tickets on the day of the show, however, if you wanted seats in the first few rows we were told we needed to book months in advance.The show lasts approx. 1 hour, and gets pretty packed. After the show started, there were still groups of tourists entering which wasn't great as it was quite distracting. The puppet show was interesting, and the live orchestra were amazing (they played some beautiful pieces). However, the experience was slightly ruined by inconsiderate tourists extending their arms vertically so that they could record the show and take pictures. The constant flashing of the cameras made me feel nauseous.I would still recommend the show despite the negatives, just something to take into consideration."

For starters, the auditorium is not well ventilated (no A/C) and the seats are not the most comfortable and are pretty crammed (I am 5'11\" and it is worst than US air carriers economy seat spacing between rows) aside from the auditorium issue, the show was quite an experience. It was very neat to see skits related to rural way of life and Vietnamese folklore with some humorous twists. It was filed with unique colorful puppets along with singing and dialect between the puppets and to the orchestra. The down side of the dialects is that it was all in Vietnamese and for a foreigner, you will need to image what the story is about based on the puppets that show up. It would be nice if they had some sort of scrolling panel with some English translations so foreigners to help them understand/follow the show better, than again most places don't do this (seen it once in China, but that is about it). Also the show had some special effects (mini fireworks - more like flares). The orchestra in the show included some Asian traditional instruments and the music flowed well with the skits. Again this was a very unique cultural experience and would recommend it if you have the time."

It was the second show of the day and not as crowded as later shows.If traditional Asian style music puts you to sleep - don't go. But we thoroughly enjoyed watching one particular musician playing her traditional stringed instrument. The storyline seemed pretty basic to me.It may have been nice to have had an English translation but even listening to the young girl behind me she grasped the idea of the various scenes being portrayed as she asked her father what the cat, the crane, the turtle, the dragon etc were doing.It's about a 50 minute show and I thought the puppetry excellent. I found it thoroughly entertaining.I would highly recommend it but don't go if you hate culture, traditional music, traditional singing or puppets. Just go with the flow and enjoy something cultural of Vietnam."

There's not much to do in this city so it provides an activity to do. The gelato/sorbet in the theater lobby is excellent refreshment and you CAN take it inside. Try and get seats in front or its hard to see.seats are very close together and the rows too.it gets warm inside so be prepared.

This puppet show has its roots in an art form that dates back to the 11th century. I was told the tradition of water puppet theatre started from a time when rice paddy fields were flooded and villagers would make entertainment by standing in the waist-deep water with the puppets performing over the water. The show will start with folk music composition then the show with various themes such as dragon's dance, fishing, catching frogs etc. The show lasted about one hour and I enjoyed every minute of it.

Like nothing g else we've every seen. It took us a few Mai Utes to figure out how the actually operate them (we won't spoil it for you).If you'd like, you can pay $1 extra to be able to take photos during the show.

Puppet show quite nicely done and surely requires some good skill. However, the venue is very tired, no AC and latecomers are allowed to distract others by being allowed to come in late (and many do).The ladies singing had beautiful voices but seemed quite distracted and were chatting to each other. I suppose after 5 previous shows same day one would get bored.After the show you can buy some nice hand carved puppets which are cheaper than in shops outside.Overall, a good place to visit once and the price very reasonable."

The theatre provides a great insight into Vietnamese life, culture and art, as the announcements were in Vietnamese and English, but the performances were in Vietnamese only. The theatre would be ideal for art and theatre lovers, but it is a bit hard to follow the acts with only the theatre programs as your guide. The acts are accompanied by live music and a great way to immerse yourself in Vietnamese culture in a short time. The cost is reasonable and takes over an hour at the longest, but if your short on time and not a fan of art of the theatre then there are better things you can do with your time. Also this is very close to the lake of the restored sword."

So i bought tickets to this last minute as a friend was persistent that I had to go and I had pretty much exhausted the old quarter of activities. I attended the 8pm show, they run several throughout the day. The 60k Dong($2.75) tickets were sold out so I had to buy the 100k Dong tickets($4.50) not a huge deal but my seat was in row D. God forbid you are over 4 feet tall and sit in row D... the guy to the right of me was 6'3'' and had his knees in his chest with just his toes on the ground, the guy to my left was from San Francisco and a riot but as well was breaking his knees to sit in these seats. Perhaps it's a cruel trick they play on foreigners, but this place is pretty small and I don't see a need to get the more expensive tickets. The performance goes through 14 scenes and is very well performed with traditional folk music. It's not translated but if you pay attention and have a bit of imagination you get the idea of what is going on. Grab an English Program in the upstairs lobby and you will be able to follow pretty easily, and have an idea when the show is about to be over if you get stuck in a short row...The performances are as follows: 1. Prelude by clown Teu2. Thang Long festival drumming3. Dragon's dance4. Buffalo-boy playing the flute5. Agricultural work (rice planting, soil ploughing, water scooping) 6. Catching frogs7. Chasing the fox that tries to catch ducks8. Fishing9. Xa thuong: a melody in the collection of hymns dedicated to the cult of Holy Mothers.10. Phoenix's dance11. Le Loi returning the sword12. Unicorn's dance13 Eight fairies' dance14. Four sacred animals' dance (dragon, unicorn, tortoise, phoenix) Worth an hour of your time while in Hanoi. An interesting diversion."

If you are tall and you book early I wouldn't bother paying the extra for front row seats. It was just good for me because I am short so being so close meant I didn't need to look through so many heads. But for my Bf and my friend it didn't really matter. The show was really cute and funny. Even though it's mostly in Vietnamese you can easily follow along with help from the program. There is a live traditional Vietnamese band which is also really cool. I would recommend going, it was a nice thing to do at the end of the day."

Well, this one was too, but at least it felt something different and good. The show takes one hour more or less and is comprised by many scenes. Some of them are really surprising, but after a few, the limitations of the puppets make the show a bit repetitive. Nonetheless, the show has a high standard artistic quality, with live music and a very significant number of different puppets. No need of subtitles or explanations as the acts are quite simple indeed. Photography permit required."

I guess some people have become accustomed to expect something like Disneyland wherever they roam and if you are of that ilk avoid this place by all means as you will annoy people like me and it will not float you boat . But this little word link explains it all because the mastery of swooshing puppets and facing magic fish is what it's all about and this is enhanced of course by music and singing which would probably not appeal to many Western ears for too long.. But give it a chance after all it doesn't go on too long and if you are eight feet tall like me you will be glad about that because the seating was obviously planned for smaller people . All the characters are so true to their origin it's a pity that the story is not translated on paper for our benefit but l think we got the gist of it and we are so glad we bought our \" Happy Man \" puppet and his partner \" Happy Woman \" l'm looking at them now with a smile on my silly face and they're smiling right back at me - in fact if l am not mistaken Happy Man has just given me a little wave.."

Nonetheless, we tried since it was one of the main attraction of Hanoi. We were seated at the front row (I suggest you not to do that if you're allergic since smoke from the show is just in front of you). What I love about the show is their artistry / creativity. The puppets are choreographed, sound effects, lighting, and the story line. The sound of the voice of the singers is very relaxing.But since everything is in Vietnamese, I couldn't understand anything and let my mind wander.. it could've been better if they would at least give the non-Vietnamese speaking people something to understand what's going on. It was worth the visit, but if you have limited time in Hanoi, I don't suggest the show. You can try and roam around the Quarter instead. That was my first visit, and prolly the last."

But, it ended up being one of our favorite attractions in Hanoi (coming in just behind the street food tour). The musicians were excellent (especially the vocalist), and the puppeteers are crazy talented. The beauty of a show like this is that the puppets tell the story, and you'll understand it no matter what language you speak. After the show, souvenir puppets are sold for very reasonable prices (I think $4 US). I got one, but wish I would have gotten multiple varieties, because they make a great authentic decoration on our mantel at home.The bathroom on the first floor (shared with the cafe) is a little scuzzy. Ladies, make sure you bring your own tissue and hand sanitizer. The cafe staff was washing the dishes in the bathroom sink, so I'm not sure that's where I would grab a bite to eat."

There are few talking sequences which are difficult to grasp because they are only in Vietnamese. If you read about the legends and customs you will recognize some of the scenes. The whole show gets very repetitive. Live music and singing is very nice but a mild music combined with fumes coming from the stage made some people very sleepy. There are very little place between the rows so if you are tall aim for the first row or sitting close to the side."

The music was traditional and fantastic. The puppet dancing was incredible and very unique. Leg room was a major concern - I have bad knees but managed the hour okay. Be warned though because it is a little cramped. Our session was probably only one third full so a lot of people decided to move forward and closer to the stage just as the show began which is also good value for money if you're concerned. We caught the 8pm show. They do around 3 shows per day, check their website to see what will suit you best. I definitely suggest trying to catch it!

This theatre production has potential....Though I think it's probably produced more for children, it could be enjoyed by all if it were produced in English. The show itself and the music is quite lovely but the message or lesson is completely lost on a foreign audience, because nothing is explained or explicit so my family and I walked away feeling disappointed and uninformed.This show would have been received better if there was an option to purchase English audio or if there were an English voice-over during the production. Seems a shame that the theatre doesn't cater to the genuinely interested tourist."

Tickets were 100,000 dong each ($4.47 or 4.12 Euro each). The show is about 45 minutes long and provides some insight into the culture, history, and legends of Vietnam. I would recommend this after taking a few tours or reading at least a little about the country from guidebooks. I say this because the performance is not in English, but if you know things like the phoenix, turtle, unicorn, and dragon are sacred animals, for instance, you still get the gist of the performance. And even if you don't catch it all, the puppetry and accompanying music on local instruments are interesting. Overall, we think it's worth 45 minutes and $4.50. There are cheaper seats, 60,000, (about $3) and those tickets would be fine, too. The place is small enough that you can see from anywhere."

When we arrived we were seated in row G which is 1/2 way to a 3rd of the way up the seating rows. The best seating row is 'A'. The show starts with delightful instrumental music & soon after the puppet action starts.At this point every narrow minded & inconsiderate twit pulls out their smart phone or camera & starts holding it up in front of your view & snapping away at terrible photos. For the entire show I had almost every person from row 'A' to 'F' holding up their recording divides, flashes and all. Then there are the people who can't sit in their allocated seats & end up blocking the view for about 10 people behind them. For the short time I got to get a glimpse at the show & story line I thought it was absolutely fantastic. Bottom line is, make sure you get seated in row A or book out the whole theatre for yourself.

The show is very good and defintly not to miss if you are in Vietnam for the first time, except that we also stopped in our way back from Halong Bay in a farming village to see a show in an outdoor theatre, although the show was shorter it felt 100 times nicer and more authentic than the show inside the Hanoi Theater.Overall the show is very intresting and it depicts some of the most important Vietnam cultural aspects and Hanoi legends through the unique water puppets.We also had no issue coming there 40 minutes before and getting tickets 4 standard ticket for an evening session, we got the row before last and you could see perfectly OK. The show is long enough to be intresting but not too long to get tedious so our 6 and 10 year old kids also enjoyed it."

We did not buy the premium tickets but we could easily see the performance. We were about half way back in the theatre. There were a number of different stories.

Hence this time, the hotel I stayed in (Hanoi Elegance Emerald) assisted me in procuring tickets for that Sunday show which was my first day of arrival.Although the songs were all in Vietnamese, and I really didn't know what it was all about, I recommend seeing this at least once, if only to pay homage to this unique puppet show. The costumes of the puppet, lighting, stage and singers as well as musicians give us a good performance (even though I bet they've probably could have done this in their sleep with all the performances they do every day!).If you are staying at the Old Quarter and near the Hoan Kiem Lake, pop on over to this theater and get your tickets earlier so that you can choose which time and seat you will have when you see the show. I think its best if you sit a bit nearer to the front because sometimes you have people with bigger heads and bodies blocking your view (funnily, one or two guys were apparently sleeping in some acts).Arrive earlier so that you can queue decently as well as not disturb other folks who may already be seated or if the show has already started.There's a couple of shows scheduled every day, usually starting mid-afternoon.We got the VND 100,000 ticket and were seated comfortably away from any water splashing which may inadvertently occur.You can buy some souvenir puppets in the lobby area, or you can enjoy a cup of Vietnamese coffee when you leave the theater."

Don't let it stop you seeing the show, just be careful."

The music and setting took me into another space/time immediately and the lack of subtitle meant that the performance became completely alien to me which added a mystical quality to the whole thing. The puppetry is very well done, kids are especially excited to see actual objects moving around the stage, that's the magic of a show that actually involves some physicality instead of just moving images. For sure its touristic and people take photos/vids with their phones and make noises but isn't that nice to enjoy a show once in a while with interaction from the audience and just pure innocent fun? Completely great for the price and experience."

So if you want to go you MUST get front row seats or else you'll get blocked views from the people in front of you videoing etc. Also there was a constant damp smell throughout the show which made me feel uncomfortable.

True to the title, the puppets are brought to life by the skillful and adept manouvering of behind-the-screen 'players'. The unraveling of the Vietnamese peasantry folklore story really kept me at the edge of my seat even though it was in their native language. The crystal clear sound effects and seamless performance of the water puppets are unparalleled to other performances I have watched hitherto. At the end of the show, I gave these superb water puppet 'players' a standing ovation. It's highly recommended to visitors to Hanoi."

All singing and lines are in Vietnamese and on our visit there were no subtitled performances or information in any other language for sale at the theatre.Overall: enchanting show, one is completely immersed by the scenery and music (we had front roll seats and did not get splashed with water!).

Were told the show was booked out although there were quite a few seats left, I imagine people book like we did but because no payment is made until you get there it is no big deal for them to do a no show if they feel like it. Because of that I would rock up to a show even if it says booked out as I imagine it happens to most of the sittings.Chairs were small in leg room and I imagine a problem for tall people. Show only goes for 45 min all in Vietnamese. I agree with others it would help to have it spoken or at least subtitled in English. This is a show aimed at tourists, most of who cannot understand a word.It seemed to be lots of little skits. Some we caught on to the meaning, some we didn't.Most exciting thing was near the beginning, some of the sparklers caught the curtain on fire and there was an audible gasp from the audience but the flames were quickly put out by someone backstage with the water from the pool! Needless to say it had me looking for the nearest exit just in case...It was a good way to kill some time and see a bit of Vietnamese culture."

The show let me know more about the culture of Vietnam. It was really worthy for 100,000VTN. I think if you want to watch the show, you better go there earlier. "

We have seen much nicer and impressive cultural performances in other Asian countries. This show can be missed if you have elsewhere to spend time at."

The auditorium started to get warm as it is packed with people, not sure they turn up the aircond's celcius as it is winter day on month of Dec.The only uniqueness about the show is that the puppets are controlled by puppeteers underneath the water and the show was enhanced with fireworks effects and dry ice smoke. There's one scene where the puppet (an animal) climbs up the tree and i thought that was quite cool!Do notice some viewers dozes off as the lights were out. Anyway, it's an eye opener to have watched the show but would not experience it again as it is not engaging or something memorable."

The show is somehow divided into different sections and storylines linking each sections.There were no English conversed during the whole show. Lucky me, I had my eBuddies explaining the story for most plays. I do see people dozing off halfway through the show.

I booked a ticket for an 8 pm show on 16 December, which happened to be packed with tourists (not surprising, given that it's 8 pm). There are 5 showtimes in a day, the earliest starting at 3.30 pm. Would strongly recommend individual travellers/tourists to book their tickets in advance - one or two days prior will suffice - because most seats would be taken up by tour groups. Ticket prices are 100 000 VND for first class tickets, and 60 000 VND for normal tickets. I got the first class ticket, but was allocated to Row L. Not too ideal, since it wasn't exactly what I've hoped for. Advice to fellow travellers - book your tickets early! And try to get the front rows (Row A to about Row G), otherwise you'll be staring at the back of people's heads if you're not too tall. Show was rather interesting, despite it being entirely in Vietnamese. The only performance that I understood was the return of Emperor Le Loi's sword to the heavens! The rest of the performances depicted Vietnamese lives and legends eg. growing rice in paddy fields, dragons bantering with one another. Walked away being really impressed by the puppetry and the art of water puppet theater - you have to admit that the puppeteers are really skilled in controlling and handling the puppets! A great way to spend 45 minutes, and would recommend it to tourists heading to Hanoi."

They explain in the intro what the overall story is about in english, but after that it is not translated which I think I would prefer anyway. The only complaint I had was regarding their lack of a flash photography policy. During the show a lot of people would be taking pictures with their cell phones, which I could understand since it is such a unique experience, but some people went full flash with their cameras and that became very distracting (and seriously, how great can those pictures be when it basically highlights the heads of the people in the row in front of you). It would be nice if they banned flash photography during the show."

Though dialogue was in Vietnamese (obviously) the story line was easy to follow, and even if you were a bit lost with the story, the music and puppet action kept me engaged.Ticket prices vary based on seating. We were very close to the front and unfortunately I had a real tall guy in front of me--I'm not sure it's worth paying the extra for close-up seating, but if you're short or have kids along (and didn't have a tall guy in front of you!) maybe it would be.Show lasts under an hour which for us was just right.

Oh my god.The show is interesting the first two minutes, right until they start with the music intro. The puppet show is around 45 minutes and at the end of minute one you have pretty much seen everything they got. The rest of the time is absolutely a waste of time and money. Interesting as it could sound as part of ancient vietnamese culture, only tourists can be found in the audience. So that i found quite telling. After the first story everybody claps and pays attention. You can totally feel how gradually the audience is either sleeping, talking with the neighbour or just sitting there wondering if it is possible to exit the theatre in the middle of the show. Not good at all. "

A very colorful and sometimes funny performance that lasts about an hour. Acompanied by a small orchestra with narration by two young with great voices."

Visually speaking, it was interesting. However, it got quite boring given that we couldn't understand anything because everything was spoken in Vietnamese. The language barrier is something you could not ignore. They could've at least spoken in english bearing in mind that it was a tourist attraction and majority of the viewers were visitors. Looking around the crowd, I saw that a lot of people were getting drowsy and started falling asleep halfway. So was I.I recommend to watch this early in the day before getting tired from all the other activities of your itinerary so that you won't get easily drowsy and have more energy to persevere. Nevertheless, it was quite a sight to see."

The show lasts for 45 minutes which is long enough because though at first it is an interesting cultural spectacle it does get a bit tedious after a while - there are only so many splashing puppets you can take really. Also the whole show is narrated in Vietnamese so even though I accept it may have an interesting story I had no idea what was going on. The live musicians who accompany the show are excellent though, playing traditional Vietnamese instruments. The puppeteers are hidden behind the water tank and they operate the puppets using long sticks hidden under the water. The use of fire and sparklers does make some of the show quite impressive but as I said it does start to drag on after a while and 45 minutes is long enough. Definitely worth seeing though."

There were people that were sitting in our assigned seats and the staff didn't ask them to move. We sat in the next available seats we saw open. The leg room maybe a little cramped for a 6 foot individual but comfortable for a 5'5\" person. With nosebleed seats, we were still able to see the puppets.

You can get a ticket very easily on the day from the theatre and there are many showings throughout the day. I bought my ticket around midday for a 6.30pm showing for 100,000 VND and I'm not sure if they allocate the best seats first but my seat was on the second row which was pretty awesome.For my show, the theatre seemed pretty packed and you can grab a leaflet on the way in, showing the order of performances. There are musicians to the left of the stage with some Vietnamese instruments which I had not seen before. All puppet shows are done to background music with some singing and voice overs in Vietnamese which I did not understand, but I did not feel that it hindered my enjoyment of the performance.They make the shows very fun and enjoyable to all the family, and it's an interesting concept which I believe was derived as local entertainment when the rice paddies flooded."

It was the last point of call on a day long private tour organised by EXO Travel. As the whole show is in Vietnamese it was fortunate that our tour guide had explained some of the more popular legends like the sword in the Hoan Kiem Lake to us before we arrived.The performers are very skilful with the various puppets (fairies, dragons, snakes etc) dancing and jumping in and out of the water. It is easy to see how this artistic expression has its origins in the village pond where all the community came together to share their legends and be close to their natural environment. The instrumentalists and vocalists also displayed a high degree of skill and provided a lovely background to the puppetry. It would be great if some of the stories were available in English to take away and absorb as I'm sure we missed some of the finer intricacies of the performance."

It is a unique folk art that originated a thousand years ago during the Ly dynasty (1009). The show is in the water, and the people who control those puppets are also in the water, too. There is no much conversation during the show, so, it is no need for you to understand the Vietnamese at all. The content is mainly reflected the simple local life in the ancient time, like farming or fishing. I really like the way how they preserve their traditional culture.

If you are taller than about five foot three, you might want to book seats on the first row (row A) because the leg room is very tight! The set was beautiful, like a temple backdrop with a pool in front. The musicians sit to the side and the music and singing was beautiful as was the unique puppetry. They allow photography. The entire show is in Vietnamese, however it is easy to follow. The only thing that could have been been better is that this one hour show could have been shorter.The cafe inside the theater is a little pricey, but it has good quality food.

But service was non existent. The single ticket office lady was quite rude and ignored the line of customers while shopping online on her tablet. When she finally gave us her attention she asked for the day and time then didn't let us choose our own seats but immediately circled them for us. The entire first row was empty and wasn't reserved but she wouldn't allocate them. Right when we were handing over the money for the tickets the phone rang and she ignored us while talking for 5 minutes about an enquiry in Vietnamese then finally hung up but the phone immediately rang again and she answered the second call once more. Surely customer service should be balanced. She should've answered the call, asked them to hold, finish the transaction then go back to the phone and alternate between the phone customers and physical customers. Instead the line was continually growing. The person behind us said something to her in Vietnamese while she was on the phone because it really took that long but she just ignored him. When she finally got off the phone there was no apology or smile and she even gave us the wrong time even though she had already allocated the tickets. Despite the lack of service, a great show that's well worth a visit."

But we were able to get a gist of a couple of stories (the ones with just dancing puppets and no dialogue). After the show got over, we saw many people carrying brochures and we found out that the brochures explained the basic plot of the stories (although not in too much detail and I didn't see anyone consulting the brochure during the show). Somehow these were not given to us. If you visit, make sure you get your hands on one. The show is not extremely entertaining as such. But I recommend you go if you are interested in having a truly cultural experience.

The atmosphere was heavy due to the water evaporation which made it a bit difficult to breathe. All dialogues were presented in Vietnamese (why not have a subtitles monitor somewhere?). It lasted toooo long... After the first couple of acts, there was no actual interest as you cannot understand. Nevertheless, the acts were funny and generally it was a good attempt. I was also disappointed by the toilets condition... No paper, no hands soap and a bit dirty."

As musicians ourselves, we were amazed by the skill and artistry of the nine or so musicians, who provided every bang, boing and twang of incidental accompaniment, as well as full songs and tunes. As for the puppets themselves, they were entrancing, amusing and fun. There were water-blowing and fire-breathing drams, leaping fish, dancing chickens (or were they Phoenixes??), dancing maidens, a mini-tiger catching a duck and climbing a tree, and more. It's something you won't see anywhere else in the world. And even though the words are in Vietnamese, the languages of music and theatre are easy to understand."

Also the show runs so often once it is open for the day, you have a choice of times. As the theater is quite small and fills up quite easily, it is advisable to book in advance. The ticket seller will try and sell you the more expensive seats but in reality you can get just as good a view with the cheaper seats since the theater is so small.Even if you don't understand the show and language, no matter; the music is great."

The puppets are wonderful works of art and have surprisingly lifelike movements. Getting a good seat is critical. It is well worth paying for the more expensive seats with a better view.

If I'm honest I would get the cheaper ones, unless your on the front row the seat doesn't matter. The puppet show and the singing was entertaining for the first 20-30 minutes but me and my friends soon found ourselves looking at the time to see when it would be finished. The whole show takes about 45-50 mins. It's worth going to the show for the cultural experience but don't go when tired as could feel myself nodding off towards the end as it was dark. It would also be better if the scenes were explained both in Vietnamese and English as you do get a card which helps you follow but would be nice to just have a quick reminded through the speakers as well. Was okay for a one time thing to kill some time in the night but I wouldn't go back again."

A small brochure describing what each puppet story represented was given to everyone, most common languages were catered for. A small traditional vietnamese band performed beautifully before the lights dimmed and the variety of puppet performances began. Although no words were spoken the performance was accompanied by music and singing and traditional stories were told sometimes humourously about Vietnamese life and culture. The performance lasted for about 40 minutes. We all thoroughly enjoyed the show however the seating was hard and extremely squashed so much so i felt claustrophobic at times. Little puppets were on sale outside for about $5 . Overall a very entertaining performance (If you find this review helpful please tick the box tks )"

There was a Caucasian audience taking picture with a flash camera behind us non-stop throughout the show. I know there was no signage forbidding flash camera because the puppets could not complain. But I strongly advise the management to forbid the use of flash camera so other audience can enjoy the show."

No matter how much we googled, searched, or inquired, all of the answers were the same: No. How can a city with such culture have no live music to be found? At least Thang Long Water Puppet Theater offered a glimpse into the ancient past of Vietnamese culture with a small orchestra of musicians playing instruments I have never seen in real life before and three women who sing in the most angelic way. The best part is that the music is incorporated into the water puppetry that you watch. You can see before your very eyes the culture and the beliefs of the people by the display of the various numbers performed by the puppets in conjunction with the music. The only downside is that for someone who is very tall, the seats are crunched together so it is not that easy to get comfortable for the little over an hour show. So if you are tall and you decide to attend a show, which you definitely should, make sure you are not alone and are sitting by someone you want to get really close to so you can lean on them while you watch the magic and splendor unfold before you."

You can buy retired puppets beside the lake (and several other places) for less then the ones for sale at the show. I have been to both the show here in Hanoi and the one in Saigon. They are a bit different the one in Saigon is funnier but the one in Hanoi is more original (water puppets started in this area) and more professional. We were lucky to have a two string harp player do a short recital before the puppet show started, it was excellent. Don't get seats in the front unless you want to get wet (in Saigon) and don't get side seats in Hanoi."

We went with an open mind and found the music and singing leading up to the show was very interesting and entertaining. Then the puppet show started, each with a different story line. It was all in Vietnamese so we couldn't understand anything. The puppets were smaller than we expected but I suppose that's so they can be easily maneuvered. The puppeteers were hidden behind the curtain and it was amazing how they made those puppets dance and move around. At the end of the show the puppeteers came out from behind the curtain to take a bow. You could see the pride and gratitude on their faces that people came to watch their show and that is what did it for me! It's not about the puppets or the water, it's about the skill of the puppeteers and keeping the Vietnamese tradition, which will discontinue if the younger generation don't continue with it and that's will happen if no-one attends the show! Yes it is for kids but if you want to support traditional Vietnamese entertainment, then I would recommend it for young and old."

Much of it seems to revolve around gathering of food, clearly an important part of life in many cultures.The manipulation of the various puppets through the water was astounding and the accompanying traditional music supported the actions of the characters well.As with many forms of theatre, the story is only part of the entertainment, with the masterful craftsmanship and diversity of the puppets being impressive in itself, as well as the handling by the cast (hidden behind a curtain) and the use of fire to enhance and accentuate certain scenes. It was difficult at times to establish how the puppeteers were able to create such fluid movement and interaction of the characters through the water, which increased my enjoyment of the performance."

If you did a little bit more reading prior to going to watch the show, you would understand and appreciate it more. Yes the singing is conducted in Vietnamese, and I appreciate that even more because its traditional and keeping to their true culture and heritage.Here is what I learnt and I with everyone . The puppets are made out of wood and then lacquered. The show is performed in a waist-deep pool. A large rod supports the puppet under the water and is used by puppeteers, who are hidden behind a screen to control them.Traditional content of water puppet performance like daily life of Vietnamese farmers (cultivating, tending buffalo, catching fishes\u2026), communal entertainment (swimming contest, dragon dancing\u2026), or historical legends (Le Loi returns precious sword\u2026), with modest performance way have appealed audiences for centuries. However, the artists of Thang Long Water Puppet Theater want to renew the old puppet shows with effect of light, music and combination between people and puppets.You can easily walk to the Puppet Theatre, its right opposite to Hoan Kiem Lake and buy tickets on the day or the day before to secure your seat preferences. Please note that every session is always full, so get in quick before tickets sold out on your preferred session. Also just a tip, the theatre is quite small, so if you wan to save some VND I suggest to chose the back section.Alot of websites dont clearly state the Puppet Show sessions, so I took the liberty of taking a photograph of the session times (please see below listed and photo as well) just for ease of mind for those that are planning their itinerary for Hanoi. =)Cost: 60,000 VND (back section)/ 100,000 VND (front section)Show times (daily): 3pm, 4.10pm, 5.20pm, 6.30pm, 8pm, 9.30pmDuration: 50 minutesEnjoy the show!!

The well designed stage and the idea of performing a puppet show \"on water\" are certainly something unique and attention catching. BUT (and it is a big \"but\"), what you have to endure as an audience is 10-odd acts of relentless epileptic attack of the puppets with water splashing and repeated vigorous actions, accompanied by squeaky and irritating oriental/Vietnamese music.Inevitably, only two questions remain in your mind after the 3rd or 4th act, \"Why am I here?\" and \"When is this going to end?\"..."

The show takes about an hour and it was fun to see, my 12 year old was not so impressed and my three year got a little scared. All in all it is fun to see how well the puppets are controlled and the occasional fire add a little dramatic flare. The saloon where the show is performed is about the size of an average size cinema.I enjoyed the show but don't expect any spectacular. I would say that, if you are nearby and have nothing to do then rest your feet and watch the show. I would see the show in conjunction of taking a tour of the old quarters or some other activity."

I wasn't disappointed.First warning though - the entire show is in Vietnamese, but that doesn't bother me because it is quite a visual show and most of it doesn't require translating (unless of course if you have no imagination or don't like things with a cultural bent). Second warning - if you want to use a camera you need to pay a little more (unlike Saigon last year when I was able to bring some great video back to show the family). If you use a flash or phone just be aware of the rest of the audience, it can be distracting and even block a view. Third warning - book in advance to avoid queueing, especially for the evening performance.The set-up is unusual. The audience seating is normal, but the stage area comprises an area to the left to accommodate the singers and orchestra, and the rest is essentially a curtain across the back of a stage full of water. You don't have to know how the puppeteers manage to make the puppets do all sorts of things (fish, squirt water, create fire etc.) - just sit back and enjoy. The show lasts about 60 minutes and is not expensive. Not only do you get to appreciate the traditional instruments and songs live, but the unique skill and dexterity of the puppeteers behind the curtain recreate quite a different cultural experience."

Earlier in the day we had visited the Museum of Ethnology and seen the authentic water puppets and viewed an old water puppet stage in the outdoor exhibits, so had something to relate to when attending the show. The live music is extraordinary and the puppetry, considering it is done from behind a stage, standing in water is also terrific. The show isn't very long, maybe an hour in length, but the theatre is air conditioned, the seats comfortable, and the show very affordable. I think it is worth seeing when in Hanoi."

There was a wonderful festive atmosphere & tonnes of people in the streets that was fun to be a part of. As far as the show, the theatre seats were a bit hard & had very little legroom even for someone like me who is just a shade under 6 feet tall. Had I been 6'4\" it would have been very uncomfortable. I enjoyed the show very much. The music was good and the puppet techniques were very skilled & very adept at making the puppets come to life & project character. In my mind it is a show well worth seeing. You need special permission to photograph the show though (they want you to pay for the privilege to do so). I think this is a must see when in Hanoi."

However, I am also glad I went into it with low expectations for audience behavior. Many people were speaking loudly during the performance. The worst was when someone let their three children wander up to the stage in the middle of the performance. It was distracting to the entire audience and performers. This is clearly the guardian's fault; however, it would have been nice if the theater had kindly ushered the children back to their seats. I saw a previous review stating their children could not see from the back. Maybe this provoked it? So parents, buy front row seats. I brought earplugs. Theater very warm."

The presentation was unique Vietnamese water puppet show and was well choreographed and skillfully presented not to mention the live music to go with.The show is about one hour long. Make sure to buy tickets in advance as shows can be sold out quickly. The theater is near the Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake and air conditioned. The rows of seats are quite close to each other with very limited leg space. Not very conducive to get out in the middle of the performance if you wish to do so though.The puppeteers are very skilled and have conducted international shows. Good for children who could understand what is going on. Not a good idea to take babies. Tickets in good seats could be pricey by Vietnamese standards (500,000 VND).A recommended visit."

The show is well presented in both local and english languages with folk singers and musicians providing the soundtrack to the amazing puppet performances. The show has toured quite extensively around the world and I highly recommend a visit to this spectacle. The bookings are inexpensive but be aware that it is very popular, with busloads of tourists frequently arriving, so arrive a little early to guarantee a preferred seat.

The show's themes include humorous topics, depictions of rural traditions, and important history as well.

I spent most of the show trying to work out how they did it, but otherwise wasn't my cup of tea. Seats are also not great if you have someone tall in front as the action happens low down and you may have a head in the way for some of it.

A Dutch author, Maarten Biesheuvel describes in one of his books that he was in the middle of the sea and in the middle of the night he saw someone riding on a motorbike on the water. The biker explained him that he first learned how to put a needle on the water so it would not sink. This story flashed up in my mind when I saw the Hanoi Water puppet group during their first tour through Europe in the eighties. The Vietnamese name M\u00faa r\u1ed1i n\u01b0\u1edbc, means \"puppets that dance on water\". I saw them in Antwerp and I have seen them later several times. And it is always amazing how they keep on developing. Last year I wrote an article about the Vietnamese Water Puppet Theatre them for a Puppeteer Magazine and I made several pictures when they were preparing themselves to play, but when I visited them this year they had changed again. Always developing themselves. It looks easy but it is difficult what they do, Visit a few other Water Puppet theatres and you see the difference. When you\u2019re able to visit a performance outside, somewhere on a lake. Then you understand why the puppets do not talk, with all the surrounding noise you could not understand them. The stories also had to be short and good recognizable from a distance. And how they do it? Well, the special tricks are secret, they stay into the family. But it is great to see how the puppets really dance over the water, running from here to there without disturbing each other. Outside it is really funny to see, in the Ha Noi theatre it becomes a bit of magic."

It was fairly touristy but really showed the traditional art of puppetry and old world stories of prized creatures like the phoenix, dragon and tortoise. There were 14 stories told in all and this took about 40 mins. I liked the story about the lake of the restored sword best, especially after the visit earlier in the day to the Hoan Kiem Lake and the Ngoc Son temple. I felt that the puppet show gave these traditional stories more meaning. I also admired the skill of the puppeteers and the musicians. As a first timer in Vietnam, I feel it's important to see these traditional things, even if they are a bit touristy. If I was a repeat visitor, I probably would be over this kind of thing. The other thing is that the visit to the theatre gave us a welcome reprieve from the summer heat."

The 6:30pm show was not that crowded - so would be a good option."

I enjoyed the show and I think it is a must see for any culture loving tourist. Tip: out of the different sessions available, we chose the 6.30 session as I thought most people would be embarking on all the restaurants for dinner at this time. Most people would either want a pre dinner or post dinner show. I was right. The session before was full and quite crowded. The 6.30 session was comfortable. Less people in theatre = cooler atmosphere."

A lot of it, is fairly comic.It was interesting to see the use of pyrotechniques and lamps in the performance, in some of the sequences. The show last approx an hour and is a great way to experience an art form, unique to this region. The water puppeters join in at the end for a bow.Try and get the middle seats, for the best possible viewing angles.The only gripe I may have is that, the ventilation in the theatre is poor or the air conditioning was turned low and with the smoke machine used during the performance, there is a bit of the stale air."

The acts are short skits accompanied by live music or singing and tell stories of Vietnamese folklore using the puppets.Cameras are allowed in the theatre and you can take photos throughout the performance. We were lucky enough to be sitting on row A which was excellent - we had tried at 5.20pm to get tickets for the 6.30 performance but it was sold out so we went for the 8pm instead. Do try to book ahead if you can - as a foreigner you will probably be charged 100,000 VND for Type 1 tickets but this is still a bargain.

With or without kids, for the small cost, you should experience this if you have an hour to spare one afternoon. The puppeteers have performed around the world and it is an excellent show, like nothing else you would have ever experienced. The whole show is on/in water so the technique and skill involved keep you engaged even if the story lines at times are a wee bit basic (traditional folk stories), albeit charming. One of the highlights, if you are into traditional music, are the orchestra and singers set just to the side of the pool. Outstanding musicians perform beautiful renditions of Vietnamese cultural music to support the show, including the voice overs for the puppets. Warning, the theatre is hot (they have fans blowing which helps) and the seating is VERY tight. If you are over 6 foot and talk nicely to the ushers (like I did) then they may let you sit on the aisle. If you find the top of the lake (hard to miss!), then the theatre is just across the road opposite. Make sure you book (we asked the hotel concierge to do so) as nearly every show books out and you'll be disappointed. I scored this a 4/5 as I guess it wont be everyone's cup-of-tea. If you take it for what it is and soak up the culture you will score it a 5 for sure. It's not expensive and its a part of this city. Yes near the end you start hoping it's the last act, but you still should be pleased you've experienced this little piece of Vietnam in a very old theatre. I was."

This hour-long show is entirely in Vietnamese. One of tour guides mentioned that water puppeteering is native and unique to Northern Vietnam. If you're up for something local, this is a must see. The Vietnam Museum of Ethnology also has a short water puppet show around 10am on non-rainy days. We visited the museum on a drizzling morning.

The theater is fairly small so there are really no bad seats but you get the best views sitting in the center. Our group sat in the back in the last three rows in the center and had good views. The seats are tiered in each row. The show lasts about an hour and is fun to see. Would recommend seeing it if visiting Hanoi and is a show for people of all ages. A few singers and musicians in local costume are also part of the show. Very enjoyable."

The traditional music began and the storyteller, speaking in Vietnamese, unfolded the tales as they were dramatized by master puppeteers in the water before me. I had the foresight to pick up a program in English which allowed me to follow along and understand each of the vignettes and even laugh at the jokes. The program is essential to ultimate enjoyment.This traditional form of entertainment dates back a thousand or so years and this is the best place in the country to see it. I loved the live singers; I loved the traditional 10 or so piece orchestra; and I thought the brightly painted puppets charming. There were firework breathing dragons, smoke, military battles, and water buffalo and peasants plowing the fields. At the end, the puppeteers who had been waist deep in water, came out to take a bow to the cheers of all present.I loved this experience and encourage any and all to spend the 100,000 dong (five dollars) to see this show."

Music, puppets, fireworks and lighting all gel very well together and made me feel sorry that I don't understand Vietnamese so I could follow the stories better (though the broad strokes are easily self-explanatory).With its 100,000 Dong price tag it's one of the costlier attractions of Hanoi, but it's well worth it in my eyes. It's notable, however, that you have to pay extra to take pictures or film, but I think that's fair enough.I can particularly recommend this trip for families. Frankly, when I saw a family with a young child enter and sit down in the first row, I felt a certain amount of dread, quickly vindicated by the child starting to wail. When the show started it quickly shut up, though, so I'd say that's certainly a point for the puppeteers."

Ticket seats are individually numbered and cost between 60-100k each, depending on where you choose to sit. Far better to get the tickets at the theatre than pay package tour prices that will be many times that. Shows are roughly every 60-70 minutes from 3pm in the afternoon. When you come out of the theatre auditorium, turn left (don't go down the exit stairs) and walk around to the small attached cafe and have a drink and watch the world go by. When you do go downstairs to the little shop counter, look at buying the the puppet dolls as presents. At some \u00a32.50 (US$4) each, they are a real and quirky reminder of old Vietnam Nam."

Excellent value considering what tour companies try and charge. The theatre is air conditioned and the raked seating is comfortable. If you take children book early so that you can sit in the front so they will be able to see easily. We thought it was a charming show. I think that if you go with an open mind, like art and music and enjoy seeing things out of the ordinary then you too will appreciate it. The various ancient musical instruments look interesting, amongst them a bamboo flute and something that looks and sounds very much like a theremin (sort of electronic stringed instrument which was seemingly only \"invented\" in the west in the early part of the 20th century). The show is a sort of Vietnamese version of a Punch and Judy type show but using traditional wooden puppets in a water setting. The puppets being operated by unseen puppeteers behind a bamboo curtain. As you go in pick up a leaflet in English and you will have a better understanding of the 15 little scenes each lasting about 3 minutes. In fact we liked it so much we bought a couple of delightful jointed wooden puppets afterwards. Fantastic value and great souvenir of our holiday costing \u00a35 for 2 (80,000 VND). Cheaper than 2 beers and a lasting reminder, what can be better than that?"

Water puppets is a tradition that dates back to the 11th century, where it originated in the villages of the Red River Delta area of Northern Vietnam. Originally water puppet festivals were literally held inside a rice paddy. When the rice fields would flood, the villagers would entertain each other using this form of puppet play. And it was a popular way to celebrate the rice harvest.  A traditional Vietnamese orchestra provides background music during the show. Which includes vocals, drums, wooden bells, cymbals, horns, \u0110\u00e0n b\u1ea7u (monochord), gongs, and bamboo flutes. The bamboo flute's clear, simple notes may accompany royalty while the drums and cymbals may loudly announce a fire-breathing dragon's entrance.The puppets are made out of wood and then lacquered. The shows are performed in a waist-deep pool. A large rod supports the puppet under the water and is used by the puppeteers, who are normally hidden behind a screen, to control them. Thus the puppets appear to be moving over the water.Tickets are in-expenses and performances only last about 45 minutes."

The show takes place in a nice theater with good seating. The set is fine and there is a sextet which accompanies the activity on various different instruments, including a drum set, a half coconut shell and cymbals. The players are the best part of the show, by far. But if this were my job, I would be searching for another one. The show consists of eight people standing in water behind a bamboo curtain and using long wooden poles to manoeuvre various puppets around the water basin. They move left, then right, then left, then upstage, then downstage....all with amazing predictability and all to atonal Vietnamese music. There were 12 \"different\" pieces with different puppets in each but the only difference we saw was in the different plastic figures moving monotonously around the water. There was no explanation about the show....at one point I thought that that perhaps they were re-enacting children's fairy tales....but your guess would be as good as mine. It was very painful to watch and we would have left after 5 minutes if it were at all possible. We could not even make ourselves applaud. You would do well to skip this.

Yes all the dialogue is in Vietnamese and it is likely you won't understand everything that is happening (unless you speak Vietnamese of course) but that really doesn't matter. The puppets are beautiful and the way they are operated is incredibly clever and lovely to watch. We primarily went for our two children (aged 9 & 6) but actually we all loved it. Would be a shame to miss it if you are in Hanoi given that you can't see this in any other country."

As they played and sang the puppets unfolded on the water stage.Water puppetry dates back to almost the 11thC and is well preserved and very popular even today. The puppets skim and dance on the water, maneuvered by puppeteers with bamboo rods and strings. They enact popular tales laden with humour. The show is just about an hour long. It's very colourful and entertaining. One doesn't need to know the language to enjoy it. The actions are elaborate enough to know what's going on. A must-see in Vietnam."

The music from the ten piece live orchestra is also Vietnamese. What do you expect you are in a foreign country and many English speaking people think everyone should understand them and speak the language. That being said the show is highly entertaining and how the water puppets perform is totally amazing. The big and really big deterrent is the totally cramped seating. Anyone with long legs will be squeezed beyond belief. Luckily for me, the usher saw I could not even sit down and let me sit in a foldup chair on the aisle. Not a bad idea to ask for, so you can fully enjoy the show. There are ten puppeteers out of sight during the show. They do things with the puppets that are astounding. So except for the big, big problem of tight, tight seating the show is very special and just enjoy it without an English translation. I wasn't disappointed"

Going in we were up for a laugh and didn't think much of it. The tickets don't have seat numbers on them so we took up seats in the first row. Good choice! No splashing like they warn you in LP books. We were so surprised of how much we enjoyed it. You can follow the story kind of but not into too much detail. But you can see the puppet masters are skilled, there's fire and smoke and absolutely beautiful traditional music performed by the live band. It was funny and fun. Definitely recommend. It only takes up an hour of your time."

The show lasts just under an hour (which is probably the amount of time you can sit in a seat with very limited leg room).

I guess the actions of the puppets were quite universal. It was quite an amazement though how the puppeteers moved the puppets in synchronized movements. The singing of the folk music reminds me a lot of the Chinese traditional wayang that we have back here in Singapore.However, do take note that the theater is very, very warm especially when the theatre is packed to the brim and exiting the theater takes quite a long time as there is only a few exits and it creates a bottleneck at the end of the performance."

Having said all that, we were in the front and the puppets seemed small so I can just imagine how people ij the back could see.I'm glad the show was only 45 minutes long because it was boring. I like doing cultural things but not when I have no idea what I'm watching. When I was buying seats, I demanded to see which seat I was buying. They had 60,000 and 100,000 Dong seats, I had tried to order the 60,000 dong seats but she said I could only buy the 100,000 dong seats.

Worse, the Caucasian guy seated in front of me was probably having the same problem and would lean back, making his seat back squeeze my knees even more. We were also seated at the very end of the theater (Row R) and would have enjoyed it more if we had better seats (the puppets look awfully small and unimpressive from this distance).Also, they charge an extra 20,000 Vietnamese Dong (actually only about one US dollar) to take photos of the performance (or 40,000 VND to take videos), but everyone seems to be doing it and I doubt that everyone paid for it since there was no way they could have checked and/or prevented anyone from taking photos/videos.Very negative:The staff member at the ticket booth and the manager (he had a name tag) were quite uncooperative when I tried to ask questions. While purchasing tickets, I even overheard an English guy (judging from his accent) complaining that he was very disappointed with the ticket seller because she refused to show him the seat chart (I also tried to ask for it but couldn't seem to make the staff understand what I wanted and I ended up purchasing tickets in the last row).

You could see the buffalo plowing the soil, the people planting and harvesting the rice, and even traditional figures such as a dragon and Phoenix, all in puppet size moving in seamless coordination with the music. The music was played live with traditionally used Vietnamese and Chinese instruments. The atmosphere was good, although a little westernized (of course, it was made for foreigners...). On the other hand, the seating system was a little disorganized. We had to move and change seats several times before the program started, because the staff told us to move to make space for other people although we had pre-assigned seats (handwritten) on our tickets. But all this became irrelevant as the program started, and is nothing that takes you very far astray from transporting you to the rice fields and living the stories that the puppets attempt to tell you."

Third, because camera's are allowed, you have to contend with the constant flashing of cameras or people holding them up in front of you with little to no regard of your view.The good things are that the music and singing is excellent and seemed authentic.

Also, in the upstairs lobby of the theater, you can purchase a book that has excellent information about the traditions of water puppet performances in Viet Nam (along with nice photos as well) -- which makes for a good keepsake, and is also a great way to share this marvelous experience with the folks back home too :)) Enjoy the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre!"

Firstly, line up and getting in was comical. People getting in and out had to enter through a small narrow entry, and took a decent 10 minute to just get to the stairs. The seats were hard and the not the most comfortable to sit for prolonged periods of time. On top of that the seats are also packed in close together making it hard to see the stage in certain areas if you have people of average stature in front of your seats.Overall the show was good. The water puppets, and were skilfully operated. From start to finish it was an entertaining and worth while watch if you have some time in Hanoi."

For non-Vietnamese speaking travelers the music and voice actors made it very easy to somewhat understand what was going on. But...Four things sucked the life out of the performance. Seating, cameras/smartphones, flash photography and the door.The seating was obviously made for those 5' or smaller. Anyone taller than 5' ruined the show for others as it was near impossible to see anything happening on stage (except the band, they were on a raised stage and in plain sight). Many people around me were complaining or leaning to see only half of the stage. Frustrated at the seating situation, I took in my own hands and opened a seat on the stairs to the left of the stage. This seat was great.Let's move on to cameras and smartphones... The light from these devices (not the flash, we'll get to that soon) is so terribly bright that not only are you breaking your neck to dodge another humans skull, but you're also fighting maximum brightness set on the LCD of someone's digital camera or smart phone. EVERY camera ad smart phone has a brightness setting. Lower it or keep it in your pocket.Now let's talk about flash photography... Do not. Use. At all. Ever. The f@!$ing flash. On your camera. When you're at a concert or theater performance. It's just a no brainer. Your flash is nowhere near enough as bright for the light to reflect off the surface you're trying to take a photo of so don't even bother. Most DLSR cameras have the MANUAL settings (and the ever so brilliant Auto-No Flash preset) to take a very decent low light photo. Set the ISO high and shutter speed long. Smart phones and point and shoot cameras will have little to no chance at getting a decent photo. Your flash does nothing but light up the heads in front of you and piss everyone off. I'd draw a diagram for you but it wouldn't be worth it. Just don't do it, you look like an idiot.Here's some advice. While you're looking through your lens or at your screen, you're missing the most important part of being there. The show. In real 3D world life. Take one photo, with no flash or a short video, then don't pick it up again. This will give you the chance to capture that oh so important moment and enjoy the actual show.And now for the grand finale. The door. I don't know who's job it is to be responsible for this but fix the door. All you need to do is spray the hinge with a little WD-40 and it will never make a single sound for at least 30,000 years. When the usher was taking people in and out (during the show) this bloody door would sound like a thousand men on fire. Lube it or replace it. Simple.Sadly, this theater will probably never change much at all.All that needs to be done is fix the seating, ban flash photography, enforce mandatory low screen brightness or no cameras/phones at all and most importantly... spray some WD-40 on that door."

Sounds cool in the guide book but very different when there is one puppet in a pool of water doing a monologue in Vietnamese. There were cool moments with fire breathing dragons and candle carrying puppets but those lasted a couple of minutes and the show went back to storytelling mode. If you are tall the seats are tight but they have separate chairs in the aisle.

Its basically a puppet show where the puppets are in water as opposed to being on a stage. There is a chorus of people singing off to the side. You are crammed in and the theater isnt all that nice. With so many truly magical places in Hanoi (my favorite city in Vietnam), I do not see why people go here."

There are from two ( low season during monsoon time) to five show a day ( high season), starting from 3pm to 10pm. Tickets can be purchased directly from the theatre's ticket counter. Two things you should notice before the show : 1. Using cameras/ video will initiate extra cost ( Professional video recording is not permitted). 2. The legroom is quite tight among rows of seats so if your seat is in the middle of the row, make sure to use the toilet before the show starts."

There is very little commentary so you have no idea what story is being told or the significance of each puppet.There might have been one or two moments where I said 'oh', but other than that I say watch a show on YouTube and spend your time and money experiencing something else.I really felt that this was a waste of time."

My third time in ten years to see this water puppet show and this was the best experience due in no small part to having a seven year old who was totally engrossed in the show bouncing on my lap. So professional and some beautiful traditional singing and music accompanies the show. It's very bright , really colourful and has some amusing parts. The Cost is 100,000 dong (3.50\u20ac) for the most expensive seats . Its very popular and seems to be included in a lot of bus tours so If with kids book in advance and look for seats close to front. While waiting for the show you can stroll across to the lake and take some photos of the red wooden bridge and temple. if want to people watch there is a coffee shop and a fast food diner right next door. Well worth it. Only downside of puppet theatre was quality of toilets , they were filthy ....all due to patrons putting toilet paper down the toilets and not into the bins provided ( major issue in lots of public toilets) there was no paper at all so come prepared . the poor lady on cleaning really had her work cut out for her and was trying to unblock two toilets when I attended there tonight. Not to be missed in hanoi ."

The theatre isn't designed for taller people i.e. there's not a lot of legroom; however the show is not that long. The stories are easy to understand, and the puppetry and music are brilliant. I don't believe there is anything like this outside of Vietnam. It's not a long show, it's inexpensive, so it's a \"must see\".If possible try to get a seat towards the right hand side of the auditorium (facing the stage/water) as this will give a better view of the excellent musicians."

One interesting scene narrated the story of a Vietnamese King, a sword and a turtle. We guessed it had something to do with Hoan Kiem Lake (lake of the returning sword), which made the performance meaningful.The live singing of melodious ballads accompanied the movements of the puppets.

The show is very professional and features live music to accompany the action in the pool. Based on traditional stories of Vietnam, it is a series of little playlets. There is plenty of action so there is no issues with following what is going on. The day I was there the audience comprised mainly adults. But the show is enjoyable whatever age you are. The theatre is comfortable and air conditioned. At the very least it is a welcome escape from the heat. Very enjoyable and entertaining. Worth taking the time to see before you leave Hanoi."

When we tried to get tickets on our first visit, it was sold out. So it may be advisable to book the day before. There are several performances a day. Entrance is a modest \u00a33 for the top price seat. It is worth paying the additional \u00a31 more than the cheapest seat as the puppets are quite small and will be harder to see from the back rows, although I am sure you'd have a reasonable view from whatever vantage point.The artistic form is almost a thousand years old. The music is very Vietnamese, and may be a little hard on the ear at times for western listeners. But the puppets are international and the stories easy to follow. The \"sketches\" are only a few minutes long and perfect for children (or adults) with a short attention span! There are three female singers and a band.From no where, the puppeteers (who remain out of sight until curtain call) conjure up scenes of village life, fishing, farming, courting. And there are also smoking dragons and jumping fish - amazing! It has to be seen to be enjoyed properly. Just go!"

Technically it is clever stuff and some of the routines leave you attempting to work out how they are done. That said you have to ask why some of the routines were done in the first place as their story lines are somewhat obscure or long winded. The performance would have benefited with an English translation though the tradition music was interesting. A problem for Europeans is the seating is designed for a Vietnamese audience and as the majority of Vietnamese are somewhat shorter than your average Brit, the legroom is budget airline. Anyone over 6ft needs to bag an isle seat. Looking round the audience on our visit many had dozed off while a number had their mobiles out - and not to take photos. I overheard someone near me \"Oh God, there's still six stores to go before we can escape\". It would be interesting to know what the audience levels would be like if the Vietnam & Cambodia tour companies dropped this venue from their tick list itineraries."

The stories are ancient and repeated in water puppetry shows throughout the country.The Thang Long experience is one of the few water puppet performances conveniently available to the tourist Over the last few years, while the music has remained traditional, the performance has become modernized and concentrates on more spectacle than traditional scenarios. At this point, the best I can say is enjoy it for what it is -- a performance that speaks to the tourist, but one that would hardly be recognizable to the Vietnamese."

We went around noon to see if we could get tickets for the 300pm screening but was told it may be sold out. The \"may be\" is due to previous agreements with certain travel agents etc and the booking staff said we can come by at 230pm to see if there are no shows and that's what we did and we got our tickets.Its a very interesting show and kids would love it but adults would enjoy the show as well especially that the puppet show is done in this pool of water - very different from other puppet shows.I wish they would have provided more colour into the background behind the stories but it makes it more interesting trying to figure out what is going on.The show itself is only around 45 mins so give it a shot."

The show was a great spectacle and certainly something I'd recommend for those with children. It was also at this point I learnt about the Turtle, Phoenix, Unicorn and Dragon which helped me win a pub quiz later on this holiday.The great spectacle of all of this was that it's in water! The puppets are made of wood that will only last a short time as they start to get mouldy. All very interesting and something to see."

The orchestra has a unique one string zither-like instrument kept me interested as I've not seen such an instrument before and how it's played.

You are allowed to take photographs, but they are a bit blurry unless you have an expensive camera - I got a couple of good shots, but found that a short video was a much better option, and it also captured the music. We were with a tour, and were rushed back to our bus for return to our hotel, which was a shame, as many would have loved to buy the toy puppets after the performance. We left too quickly!

At 50 minutes long, I found it to be an enjoyable length of time to experience this art form. The show is entirely in Vietnamese, and there is no english (or other) translation other than the titles of each segment on the program. I did not find not \"knowing\" what was going on to be a hinderance to my enjoyment. I understand that in a foreign country, the theater is going to be conducted in their native language. It is like that all over the world.The water puppets varied depending on the segment and were quite detailed. I enjoyed the flaming dragons and drum scenes the most. There was careful choreography as well as humor throughout the show. The puppeteers come out at the end of the show and it was interesting to see how few people operated so many puppets at once. The musicians did a wonderful job as well.The theater allows photography and videotaping for a $1 fee. If you are in the back rows, expect to see many phones and cameras lighting up the area in front of you. There was only one or two rude people who blatantly held their cameras above their heads. The rest of them were held in front of people and didn't block your view.The only thing that detracted from the experience for me were the small seats. I do not consider myself to be very tall at 5'9\", but my knees were firmly against the seat in front of me from the moment I sat down. I do not know how the taller individuals in our group were able to fit comfortably in these seats other than sitting at the aisle with legs extended. If you are on the tall side, ask for an aisle or front row seat."

For 100000 VND ($5), I had a middle of the fourth row seat. A 10-person musical and vocal ensemble playing traditional music and songs accompanied the performance. The puppeteers operate the characters by using sticks and strings-all underwater. The puppets appear to be floating/swimming/moving along the surface of the stage-a 10 meter by 10 meter or so pool of murky, green water. What a great performance! I spent most of the time trying to figure out how they made it look so realistic and the other half of the time enjoying the spectacle: smoke, fire, colorful characters-and laughing children. The show lasted about an hour and 15 minutes and is really a unique, artistic treat. The only negative comment I have is not directed at the performers or the performance. Some of the adults in the audience felt it necessary to hold their camera and cell phones high in the air-blocking others' sight lines-while, obliviously, recording long videos to entertain future generations. Sit back a few rows to avoid them."

Water puppetry is a fascinating art showcasing Vietnam's folklore and the means of entertainment for the native folks in centuries past. Let me note that people either \"get\" this attraction or not. If one goes in without any insight or idea of what is happening, one gets bored very very quickly, as evidenced by some of the other reviews on this site. I would equate this to walking into an Italian Opera with absolutely no knowledge of what is happening and attempting to make sense of it all. As such, first thing before you go in, grab the programme (it is available in multiple languages, English included) and have a quick read before the act starts, it will help you understand what is being portrayed. The complexity and skill of the puppet artists were evident in the motion of the puppets, swaying, undulating and even climbing a tree. Those from sinitic backgrounds may recognise some of the shared culture we have with the Vietnamese in terms of the Lion Dance, but on water, which was an eye opener to me. The show is accompanied by a traditional Vietnamese orchestra and singers, of which little would make sense to anyone but locals, I urge you to hear past the lyrics but enjoy the music with the show. Taller attendees may find the seats to be quite tight, I am 1.8m tall and found that my knees were pretty much wedged into the seat in front of me, those seats were evidently made for much shorter people. Enjoy the show for the art that it is, and do not expect special effects or whatsoever, and please, respect the audience and the artists by not leaving in the middle of the performance, which meant standing up and blocking everyone's view for 5 minutes."

Myself and my friend went to this not really sure what to expect, but really did enjoy the show.The show we saw ran at about 50 minutes which is probably more than enough.The band were brilliant and we were both impressed with how they were playing their music from sight.The show is a fun experience, where audience members are welcomed to take pictures during the performance. But I did find myself having to check my Programme during the Performance to see what part of the show we were on. Maybe each new theme of performance they are moving onto could be made more clear to the audience. But, on the whole, great value for money at 100,000 VND a ticket which our Hotel was able to book us for on the day of the performance."

How do these clowns remember what they did on vacation before the advent of the smartphone???Until the management of the theatre introduce a ban on cameras and recording devices (like in any cinema) I recommend giving this place a miss."

The artists are truly talented and you can\u2019t help but admire their abilities long after the show has ended. My husband and I could figure out which way to look \u2013 at the puppets or at the musicians.The puppet show itself is quite dynamic and colourful. We were totally impressed by the dragon puppets who still breathed fire after emerging from the water several times. The love story of the water birds also was fascinating. A cute little baby bird pops up after the romantic dance of the parent birds. Despite the story being told in Vietnamese you soon get the idea of the story from the puppetry itself.The audience sits in a old theatre which despite being crowded and hot has an old world charm about it. Guests for the most part were friendly and polite so being crowded didn\u2019t really bother us. It\u2019s a good idea to take a fan with you though because the heat in a crowded old building soon seems to creep in on you. Probably not the best seating for someone really tall or large in build, butthat is to be expected in a Vietnamese environment.Be aware though that photography is not allowed during the puppet show unless you pay a small camera fee with your ticket. If you have a tour guide please make sure to tell them that you will be taking photographs so they can advise the ticket booth and pay accordingly.Even if you only have an hour to spare when in Hanoi this is a great attraction to visit."

The authentic music and singing was nice and there was some real talent. But we would give it a pass."

The show is split into various folk tales and stories told using amazing puppets and traditional music. I would advise saving this show until after you have done some trips around Hanoi and the surrounds to learn about the history to better understand the stories as they are only narrated in Vietnamese.Overall though a very pleasant experience and worth a watch!"

Granted, it was a bit different than what they were expecting, but captivating nonetheless. Our children are adopted from VietNam, and have a vested interest in the culture and traditions, but Grandma thoroughly enjoyed herself as well. It is well worth the price. Be aware, though, that the music is very traditional and not easily acceptable to the inexperienced Western ear. The first time I went, I can't say that I completely enjoyed myself although I really liked watching the puppets perform. This time however, I've had a few more Asian experiences under my belt and the music differences did not bother me; in fact, I realized that I have grown to appreciate Asian-style music, language, and culture. So if you're open to new experiences, you'll love this show!"

This time around was with my teenagers who really enjoyed the musical talent and the variety and skill of the puppeteers. The puppets themselves are brighter and in good shape. We really enjoyed the musical talent the best!The chairs are not comfortable for Westerers as we have long legs. We did find it annoying that people prefer to video the majority of the show than to watch it. Dodging all the camera screens throughout the shows was distracting to us. A possible solution is to sell small programs with nice photos and details about the show. Also, a professionally filmed cd or usb for sale of the show may be another option.Nicely artistically designed tshirts with water puppets on them might sell as well."

            "review": "A must-see for traditional culture seekers. We had never seen a water puppet show before and did not really know what to expect but this was a highlight of our trip. The basic premise is a stage filled with water on which puppets convey a story. You can not see how the puppets are moved, or see the puppeteers (except a brief glimpse of a hand at one point) during the show. Live music and singing is delivered by performers to one side of the stage who were clearly enjoying themselves, laughing and joking with each other inbetween the singing and playing. The puppets themselves are very varied and the actions are beautifully performed, from people and animals working the fields, to fishermen, to dancers, dragons, even the mating dances of birds. Some of the puppets carry flaming torches (was unable to tell if the flame was real or not but it looked like it) and the lights dimmed further for this night time dance scene. On other occasions fish swam, butterflies flapped around and a frog leapt back and forth across the water.My understanding is that there are in fact many different stories and which one you see will vary, but the troupe performing it have won awards around the world and the professionalism clearly showed.I could not follow the story and have no idea what was going on honestly but we enjoy that. We don't look for english speaking tourist events, but rather for the traditional culture and we found it here.You are allowed to take pictures and even film the event if you wish, though it would have been nice if they sold DVD's of it. We would certainly have bought a copy.The seats were comfortable although leg room was very tight. For a 50 minute show they were good enough. The price was very reasonable too and the building houses a waiting area and cafe downstairs and is fully air conditioned.All in all, absolutely wonderful. If you are interested in the culture, are not phased by non english performances and are in Hanoi, this is a must see show. I would point out though that this is NOT an english style puppet show. Do not expect Punch & Judy and be aware that this is not aimed at young children, who may well find it boring (as evidenced by the family with 3 youngsters sat directly behind us who did nothing but talk through the entire show). I cannot blame the show for inconsiderate audience members though so an easy 5 stars is well deserved."

We were unable to follow the stories being acted out. By the end of the hour we had reached our limit of enjoyment. There is traditional music that's interesting enough although the singing parts are somewhat difficult for the western ear. The musicians try hard to appear enthusiastic even though they undoubtedly have been performing the same set hundreds of times, several times each night. The experience is unusual. However, its entertainment value and its educational value are both low because we couldn't appreciate it."

The show lasted about 45 minutes with staged water puppet presentation about cultural folklore and stories, accompanied by traditional musical instrument band. However the play was all in Vietnamese language - if you do not understand Vietnamese you might just be there to enjoy the music, as well as, watching puppets move around in water. It is advisable to purchase tickets early in the day for an evening show as large groups of tourists flock that area and it gets very crowded. Overall I enjoyed the water puppet play (especially the Phoenix play) and would recommend it to anyone visiting Hanoi."

Therefore, it took me some struggle with myself before I decided to watch it since I was already there. And I did not regret spending 45 minutes watching the show. Thought I was going to fall asleep like my friends, but I stayed wide awake for the 45 minutes show. It was really impressive to see how the puppeteers can make the puppets move so freely in the water. After all, it is in the Guinness Record for being the longest water puppet show. For a fee of VND100K, it is definitely worth a watch. The singing and music is all live so if you really like to experience a different culture and to understand the history of Hoan Kiem lake and some of the Vietnamese cultures, go for it!"

There are programs available as you enter the theatre which give you the names of the acts you will see, this is helpful in keeping up with what's happening in the show.If you want to use your camera you will need to buy a separate ticket for this, I also recommend not using the flash setting - this is quite annoying to others in the theatre and I am sure your photos won't turn out as well as they could if you hadn't.They run several shows a day, you are able up buy tickets in advance."

The performance itself was pretty extraordinary - the puppeteers are clearly pretty talented - and replete with slapstick comedy moments. The music also seemed pretty authentic and I enjoyed it more as the performance went on. One downside was that the seats were not that steeply banked and I had a massive bloke in front of me which made it hard to see properly. If you're taking small children, be prepared (and maybe take a cushion?). At a little under an hour, it's an entertaining and peaceful diversion in a hectic city."

The puppets are pretty basic (traditional) but the puppeteers who are immersed up to their waists (and out of sight) operate the puppets in a really lifelike way and reality is truly suspended for the length of the show. One item in particular with 'dragons' is absolutely amazing! You will find it a very educational and enjoyable experience."

What I had not expected was that I liked the show just as much as they did. Singing, music, songs and the actual puppetry worked together perfectly creating a wonderful expierence for the audience. There is love, drama, history and humour on offer and in particular when the lights are turned down spectacular fire effects on water. A performance of 45 minutes is just the right time to keep young and old engaged and the price for this wonderful performance is so affordable that you can even watch it a second time. $2 more for seats in the front are well spent. Superb! Definitely worth a visit!!!"

If you have young children or you suddenly realized your meal isn't sitting too well you will find that the show goes on for about 15 minutes too long. Other than that, check it out."

A highlight of our trip and our stay in HCM city.I did have initial reservations having read some of the reviews that we might have our view impaired by people with ipads filming - occasionally someone would take a photo using one , but on a quick look around on 2-3 occasions, didnt see this happening so for us it wasnt a problem or it wasnt a problem on the night.It really is a must do - a very professional performance which is very engaging! 10/10 from me."

Before the show started, the narrator explained the background and story line in English so that the tourists, not speaking Vietnamese, would be able to understand the songs and dialogue. We booked seats for the last show of the evening at 8 o' clock.The duration of the show is only one hour, so you have still plenty of time afterwards to have somewhere a nice dinner. At the end of the show the puppeteers came forward so that the audience could see them. They actually stood in the water behind a curtain to do all these magic movements with the puppets. We as adults enjoyed the show as much as the children who were in the theatre. Highly recommended and a must see when visiting Hanoi."

The stage is a pool and the puppets seem to be able to move about the whole area. Sometimes there are so many moving objects that it is hard to understand why they don't get tangled up. The puppets were colourful and it was a great spectacle. I particularly enjoyed the fishing scene and the synchronised swimming. I wish I had paid more attention to the programme before the lights went out. There was musical accompaniment. I liked the instrumental playing but need more exposure to be able to enjoy the singing."

Tickets are 100k VND (August 2014) and for this you'll get just around an hour of entertainment, which is about long enough to get a reasonable understanding of water puppets. If you sit in the front row, you may get wet, but you'll also see a lot more than sitting further back.We got row C (three back), which is close enough to see, but not get wet. If you want to take photo's or video, then there's an extra cost (20k VND for photos), and while we were there, we saw folks warned that if they took photos (on taking out their camera) they'd have to pay. Not sure if this continued throughout the performance though.Its an interesting look at entertainment and I spent a lot of the time working out how they might actually perform some of the movements. You'll laugh out loud at some of the skits, and while the printed material that you can collect on your way in is supposed to guide you through what's actually happening and what is being sung, you can't actually see it once the performance begins, so its worth scanning it beforehand.Interesting, and a good way to sit out some of the summer heat for an hour."

Your tickets are for assigned seats so don't worry if you find yourself at the end of the line - you will still have seats together. The puppets are accompanied by local musicians playing a variety of folk songs. The music was enjoyable for us but most of them looked bored -no doubt they perform many times per day so I can excuse them for that. The puppets were interesting and it took my sons a few skits into the performance before they figured out how they were being operated which was added fun for them. I would have liked a more detailed explanation of the various folk stories being enacted as the stories were lost on those of us who did not understand Vietnamese. The brochure did provide some info in a variety of languages but was pretty brief. As our tour guide we had the next day talked to us about the history and legends as we visited various sites, we were able to related back to many of the skits in the show."

You are able to take photos throughout which can be a little annoying, especially when people are using their flash.

For example, there was a 'unicorn dance' which more looked like two dragons or dogs (they didn't look like unicorns anyway) playing with a ball than anything else.

Witty and comedic the tails told through the art of puppetry breaks the language barrier and you find yourself involved and laughing along to most acts even you have not one clue as to what is actually being spoken. The pamphlet is informative and gives you an idea of what is about to take place. Very skilful with water and fire work effects. If you don't go you have missed out on a wonderful experience. The shows occur late in the arvo nearly every hour so go in and book in advance to get closer seats. Even up the back it was worth it. Front row I do believe you pay extra. The seat leg space is tiny be prepared to be uncomfortable if you are tall ( really by this stage you are already aware of this being in Vietnam) don't bother paying for cameras everyone is doing it and they don't seem to have control on who does take pictures. Exiting the building going away from stage there is a back entrance where old puppets are stored. Can go have a look at these close up.EnjoyNote if you can't stand Vietnamese music/ singing try to sit through the first stage it's totally worth it"

Tall people beware there is little leg room between the rows so be prepared ! Also those visiting should carry mosquito repellant as there are quite a few resident mosquitos which perhaps are attracted to the stagnant water. The program is abt 55 minutes and has small performances centered around local tales including the story of the lake and turtle.The one downer is that all the commentary is in Vietnamese and the theatre should try and do an English version also.

Unless you have a great camera and a good view, don't bother taking photos or getting a photo pass...I had a point and shoot and most of my photos were blurry...just too dark and we were too far away for a flash to be useful.

I was advised to see the famous Vietnamese water puppets by a friend at home, but was rather put off by some of the reviews I read on Trip Advisor. My fears were raised when I found myself queueing, ticket in hand, in a long line of tourists waiting to enter the auditorium. I had been allocated a good seat, central and three rows from the front, so I had a good view of whatever was to come. As soon as the Vietnamese musicians started to play their traditional instruments, and the first puppets appeared in the water, I was entranced! Fabulous entertainment, and the hour sped by as one colourful scene flowed into the other. The Music was a real treat, as I had thought I wouldn't have time to attend a concert of Vietnamese music. So, two for the price of one, in my book! There were well carved puppets to buy in the lobby on the way out. I usually avoid such things, but left the theatre grasping a nicely carved wooden puppet fisherman in one hand. I go as far as saying that the water puppets are a unique experience, and a visit to Hanoi wouldn't be complete without seeing them!"

We had the cheapest category and seats in the last row in the back, but we still had a very good view of the scene. The duration of the show is 1 hour. Really fantastic traditional form of art and amusement, showing important elements of Vietnamese culture, e.g. ploughing the fields, harvesting of the rice, the 4 important animals in vietnamese culture (Phoenix, dragon, turtle and unicorn).

If you happen to be nearby, drop in.Just something to note - if you have very young children (up to possibly 2 years), forget it. It scared the bejezus out of at least two little kids near us, and one parent of each couple duly took frightened child outside to entertain them whilst partner-left-behind tried to manage other children.

There are also signs saying not to take pictures, but it seemed like 1/4 of the people in the theater with us were taking pictures practically the whole time and I didn't see anyone get in trouble. This part was a little bit annoying since we were sitting towards the back and there were fluorescent phone lights popping up here and there. There are plenty of shows everyday, don't worry about having to reserve ahead of time. My husband and I showed up 5 mins before the late show (8p) started and there was still plenty of seating space.Be forewarned - the entire show is in Vietnamese! It is a short show at 1hr. The show comes off a little bit cheesy (like a college production), but it IS cultural. Show up with an open mind and appreciation for this ancient art form."

If you have limited time, go to the Ho Chi Minh museum instead. If you go, get there early, or get your tickets booked by a tour company, usually hotels can do this. Seating here matters and tour companies have the best seats already bought up. And, if you are above 5'8\", prepare to have your knees just under your chin."

Weaknesses:-Have small seats (Suitable with small Asean people) Sadly enough, my friend who is 195cm high and 120kg weight, found sitting uncomfortable, so he chose the outside seat. I hope the theatre should be change and upgrade new big seats that are suitable with Western people. -Only perform by Vietnamese version. Its challenging to understand well for the international tourists. Should have billigual Vietnamese and English. -Some people are late, making annoyance and distraction. Please remind audiences to be on time. -Some people take a lot and take many photos with flashes. In short, this is a fantastic show which tourists should enjoy."

They have various performances during the evening and they are pretty much booked up fairly quickly. We managed to get one of the later shows allowing us to have a meal before entering the theatre. It's a pretty good sized seating area and the views are good. The show lasts about forty to forty five minutes and consists of the water puppet presentation and the orchestra to one side and two ladies singing. The music and the singing were great, as was the puppet show itself but I just couldn't follow the story. I got parts of it but was unsure what was really going on meaning it was less appealing and enjoyable. If I ignored any story then seeing how the puppeteers perform and listening to the music and singing was great but I left thinking I saw a great performance but not necessarily a great show. Perhaps the theatre could offer some form of understandable dialogue or explanation leaflet for foreign visitors in the future. I would certainly have benefitted from some assistance with understanding what was going on. Still, the show is relatively inexpensive and the theatre very attractive with a number of puppets on show in the area outside the performance hall. If you are to visit this place see if you can get some form of understanding as to what the story is telling you before you go in and perhaps this will make it better for us western Europeans."

It was full the day I went and several people left in the middle, disappointed or bored I don't know, it seemed a bit disrespectful to me, just my opinion. The location is very convenient right across from the lake. The times have changed slightly, 1st show started at 5.20pm."

There is no point rushing dinner to see a 45 minute show, so go first, then you have time to have dinner or go to the night markets on a Sunday. Sure this type of theatre is not every-ones idea of fun, but with it's cultural significance about Vietnam and Hanoi it is worth the visit just because you are in Hanoi. It is well done, It didn't seem to matter where in the theatre you sat (pre seated ticket sales), so if you are buying the cheaper seats, they still have a good view. There is not a great deal of leg room, so if you are very tall ask for an isle seat or front row (if still available).The programme is quick and each part of the show doesn't last very long so keeps your interest. As I mentioned it is only a 45 minute show. And it is very well done with live music and live singers as well as the Puppets controlled by the team of puppeteers."

It'd be great if there were subtitles but I think a lot of the jokes (particularly puns) would be lost in translation anyway. Besides the language just adds authenticity to it... I mean, you don't need explaining what the puppets are doing - fishing, flirting, etc. They have got the movement right. I was mesmerized when at one point early in the show they used firecrackers in the mouth of the dragon puppets!At one point it does feel tad dragged if you don't understand it, maybe about 3/4 into the show but I still recommend it for something different.

The start was a conversation between a puppet and one of the musicians, which is all in vietnamese so never had a clue what was going on, although this was expected, I assumed the show would speak through actions! Each of the acts I also thought I never had a clue what was going on but we picked up a running order which (think we were meant to be given at the start but somehow missed this) which basically told us what we though was going on was indeed going on!To explain one act had a boy on a water buffalo playing a flute moving back on forth across the water, no idea why this was happening or what it was meant to symbolise - turns out it was just meant to be \"Boy on water buffalo playing flyte\" as the description read! The other acts all follow a similar patter. At least for the show we saw.Overall I am glad I went but for me 20-30 minutes would have been plenty, 50 minutes was just a bit too much and I was getting a bit fed up.

When we came to the theater, we saw that there was already someone sitting on our seats - apparently the seats were double booked. When I approached one of the people who show you to your seats, he simply waived me off and told me to sit on the corner - whereas we had seats right in the center. He didn't even want to explain anything. Anyway, when the show started, there were people from the back, who were moved up front, even though I'm pretty sure they paid for the cheapest ticket. I don't know how that works, but it was disappointing. As for the show - it is really worth the visit - the mini orchestra is beautiful, the show is a lot of fun and you get to see the culture.

The only disadvantage is the show is performed in Vietnamese language. No narrative in English languages during the show, except the announcement made by the MC. The show performed in series of short stories, covering some legends stories in ancient Vietnam and some livings lifestyle of Vietnamese. The only legend story I understand is the returning of the sword by King in Hoan Kiem Lake.I was impressed by some additional tricks by the puppeteers in the water, i.e by shooting fire from the mouth of dragons. Some stories are performed in humour especially related to the daily lifestyle of Vietnamese. A-must visit place when you are in Hanoi."

The traditional folk stories were brought to life by the weaving, ducking, diving, soaring, superbly crafted puppets - I can't begin to fathom how.

There were two singers whose voices blended so well together. I'd you are in Hanoi I would recommend you visit the show as it adds a new dimension to puppets. The puppeteers actually stand waist deep in the water. As it is only approximately 45 minutes in length it will not take up too much time. Be warned you can take photographs of the show if you pay a small fee. A person in front of me had his camera held up in the air to tasks photos a lot of the time. A real pain."

If you want a fun, visible cultural introduction about the country on your first time in Ha Noi, you should get yourself a ticket for the Thang Long Water puppet show.

The only thing tip I could give you is that you should go there at least an hour before the show and purchase your tickets so that you can get a good seat. Don't get a seat far from from the stage..the closer the seat to the stage the better to avoid hands and shoulders and heads of people taking photos in front of you. if you're into videos.. make sure you got a very good HD camera and for still photos make sure the composition is right to take videos/photos on low light."

The show is divided into several little stories like chapters details of which are given in the pamphlet (which is available in English free of charge).

In fact, I'd say that you have to be somewhat jaded to not have a good time for the fairly short performances. Do not expect Cirque du Soleil.

I loved watching the musicians play the traditional Vietnamese folk music and mickey-mouse the actions of the water puppets, it was pretty interesting to watch that live. The water puppets were controlled very masterfully and with many different stories from local folklore and legend. They even made one of the water puppets climb up a tree.

Having done some research on this world renewed water puppet show before I came to Hanoi, I managed to persuade my wife to go for a show on a hot afternoon by telling her it would be a good way to get out of the heat\u2026.tricky, I know ;-)The theatre itself is quite obvious if you are at the north end of Hoan Kiem lake, it it at the north/north-east end of the lake, across the busy road. The show is about 1 hr long and we were seated in air-conditioned comfort. If anything, the fans blowing the cold air at the audience tends to make it too cold for some (like my wife). Seating is determined by the ticketing staff so be there early if you want to get front row seats. Otherwise, tickets are usually available even if you arrive last minute.I enjoyed the traditional Vietnamese show, especially the singing parts (which were quite melodic and soulful), even if I didn't understand what the artistes were singing about. The entire show is in Vietnamese, with no translations. Having read up on the story of Hoan Kiem lake before I came to Hanoi, as well as hearing the story from our tour guide, I could guess that the show was about how the lake got its name from the golden turtle who snatched King Le's sword and got it back in the end.Still, the repertoire of what you can do with puppets was quite limited, causing us to fall asleep a few times, 3 quarters into the show. The air conditioning and late afternoon tiredness after a long day of touring didn't help matters either. Our interest was briefly awakened by the fireworks-breathing water-dragons but otherwise, you could guess how the show ended\u2026with a happy ending!I would recommend anyone looking for authentic Vietnamese culture to come see it one time but to skip any return trips.P/S: We had some time after the show and spent it looking at the puppets on display on the 2nd floor of the theatre, on the right hand side of the theatre entrance."

The puppeteers stand in waist deep water behind a curtain, manipulating the puppets using long bamboo rods. The puppets comprise wooden figures, animals, and fire-breathing dragons. They dance and move through the water to the music of a live band sitting to one side of the stage. Before you enter the theatre, take a card (in several different languages) from a stand by the door. This lists the fifteen items to be performed, giving some but not enough detail. There is obviously much humour in the antics of the puppets, so it is frustrating not to understand the Vietnamese words. The seats have very little leg room, so anyone over 5' 8\" tall will be jammed against the row in front. Try to buy a seat on the end of a row, or in the front row. You can pay extra to take photographs during the performance."

I didn't know too much about the legacy of water puppet shows in Hanoi but I had definitaly heard about it so at only 100k VND a ticket i thought what the hell.I'll start by saying my expectations were very low...so low in fact that I was hoping to be seated near a door so i can make a suttle exit if i didnt like it.The show isnt in english so I could only hope to enjoy the visual display and performance although there was a bit of a problem with that - The theatres seating isnt very well set out. You have less leg room then an economy flight on an airline and my view was partially blocked by the persons head in front of me. There was a retard next to him that was holding his phone up trying to film the whole thing but the girl next to me told him off and he stopped it.The show only goes for 45 mins so if your in Hanoi... why not...just dont expect it to rock your worldI really do think they need to ban the use of cameras/phones during the show becuase it was highly annoying!"

The Water Puppets may well be a traditional entertainment, but it's difficult to tell how authentic the experience is, as it is unashamedly a tourist trap, and I didn't see any Vietnamese faces in the packed auditorium on the afternoon I visited. The entertainment is vaguely entertaining, and would probably be worthwhile if you have kids in tow. But it's all a bit twee for adults.The most annoying thing is that the first half of the performance was totally spoilt by selfish people raising phones, cameras and even hulking big tablets aloft to photograph every scene, obliterating the view of people behind them. This basically went on repeatedly until even they started to get bored. The theatre staff did nothing to prevent this, and obviously don't care, as they are raking it in for every performance.

The band and singers that give voice to each of the \"acts\" or vignettes are very good as well. The stage is a pool of water which is murky so that the mechanisms of the puppets are hidden from view. At the end of the show, the puppeteers come out from behind the curtain and it is then that you realise that they have been standing in waist deep water to run the puppets.Don't miss this show when in Hanoi.

The music and singing was excellent and the puppetry only got better toward the end. It was certainly not what we expected, but a really interesting and fun experience. We attended the late showing and the crowd was pretty small, only 1/4 full. We had good seats. While we thought all the performers were exceptionally talented, we thought they seemed a little bored with the whole thing. A little more enthusiasm on their part would have garnered five starts rather than only four. At 50 minutes long, the show was just right! Perhaps a non-starter, but it would be more interesting for foreigners who do not speak Vietnamese if the story being acted out could be explained either in verbal or written form in English. At the end of each scene, there was awkward silence because the audience full of foreigners didn't know the culturally-appropriate response to what they had just witnessed. Therefore there was only applause at the end."

I wasn't too long (I think more than 90 minutes of anything in a foreign language would be pushing it) but this is funny - the jokes work, the story is easily followed - the puppeteers are insanely talented. And the music is very well played. If you're not a theatre fan obviously not for you, but anyone who doesn't mind theatre and likes culture will enjoy."

There was so much hype because this puppet show went international many years ago.The performance started interesting but unfortunately became repetitious and monotonous.Biggest problem was the lack of subtitles for foreign audiences. All dialogue and singing was in Vietnamese. While many in the audience may guess the storyline, it would be more enjoyable if a synopsis (in English) was given before each act. Towards the end many of us were getting restive.However, I did enjoy the traditional music and singing.Perhaps when the show was performed at foreign art festivals, explanation was given in the languages of the host countries. Hence its world wide popularity. The theatre itself was small but right for the type of show. However the seats could be steeper because tall viewers, as many Caucasians are, tend to block the view of the audience in the row immediately behind."

The water puppet show was not really on my list of things to do since it sounded very touristy but since it was so close to the hotel I was staying in, I could just walk across so I bought myself a ticket (100,000 Vietnamese Dong..approx 5 USD). They have seat numbers so if you need to sit in front you have to book early. My seat was midway down the hall, but it was gallery style and I could see very well.Once having gone there, I really liked their music and enjoyed the water puppet show very much. The puppetteers are very skilled and since the brochure gives a synopsis of each of the playlets, it is quite easy to follow. I thought the show was designed very cleverly with sudden appearance of dragons from under the water, puppets climbing up trees, etc which seemed very skilled. It was very colourful and also made me laugh at parts. The show lasts for less than an hour. I am glad I did go, and also bought a little keepsake puppet from the lobby outside since they impressed me so much!"

It is clearer and when you want to take pictures, less heads to obstruct your picture-taking view. The show was visually entrancing. We wondered how they managed it because the cast came out at the end to receive their ovations. And they were not wet at all! It was colorful and energetic.

The show has a traditional Vietnamese band playing on the side of the \"stage\" which is a square pool of water with a bamboo curtain at the back where the puppets enter and leave the pool. Fire works,smoke and splashing dragons,turtles swimmers,fishermen create an enjoyable show. I would guess the show lasted 45 mins-which was long enough with shopping bags piled on our laps and very squashy seats."

Dragons breathing fire, cats running up tree trunks, birds, soldiers, boats, dancers - every type of puppet appeared from behind the screens and the puppeteers took a bow at the end of the performance.

Admittedly, the music -- which is like Chinese opera -- is not for everyone. Perhaps it is because I am Asian, but I like listening to traditional music every now and then. Our 1.5-year-old, who loves music generally, started dancing in my lap as soon as the music and show started, and was riveted. She did not fuss at all. Our 5-year-old likewise was fascinated and talked about it in detail when we got home. She even remembered details that my wife and I did not remember/see. Even my 19-year-old nephew found it interesting how they could operate the puppets in water. Again, because we have small kids, a 50 minute show was probably just the right amount of time. The chairs are a little cramped, and perhaps one could say that the ticket price (100,000 VND) is a little expensive. But given that water puppetry does not really exist outside of Vietnam, I think it is worth the experience. One final tip -- get tickets early (your hotel should be able to help with that)."

The whole performance is in Vietnamese so we didn't have a clue what was going on, but the puppets were skillfully worked and the live music gave an authentic feel to the performance. We purchased some puppets after the show and these were much appreciated by our grandchildren."

It takes a lot of skill to manoeuvre the puppets in the water that quickly and adeptly, using bamboo sticks and ropes, while standing in the water. Although I admire these skills, I found the show to be boring as it is not my type of entertainment. A few people left the show midway, while a few others fell asleep. I kept awake and watched the entire program and there are parts that are spectacular to watch.There is an extra fee to pay for a permit to take photos, which I paid. There is no enforcement and I suspect a few people took photos without paying the fee, but that is for the theatre to sort out."

It was for the most part packed and I understand that it is a big tourist attraction here. As another reviewer noted, seating quarters etc. are somewhat tight. I have no idea if they have an elevator. If they do not, you need to be able to navigate stairs for sure. The water puppet theatrics were somewhat interesting to me but what I liked more was the traditional Vietnamese music that accompanied the show. I thought that was quite entertaining being somewhat of a music kind of guy. This is one of those attractions to Hanoi that is worth doing once in my opinion but I also am objective enough to understand if others would want to go more often. The cost is reasonable by all means. Now I can say \"Been there done that.\""

We were Lucky to have a seat on the first row ( reserved by our guide of Indochina Odyssey Tours ) On the left of the water-basin, on an elevated podium, a Vietnamese band is accompanying the puppet-performance which content is a mixture of Vietnamese legends such as the Magical Sword given by the Gods to the emperor to defeat the Chinese invaders . After the war the emperor was rowing on the Hoa Kiem Lake when a turle appeared and took the sword back to the Gods.This legend and scenes of the daily life in the countryside of the North are the main topics of this show which is a real feast for the eyes. The puppets are controlled ( by puppeteers ) through a rod dancing on the greenish water of the basin.Dragons glide over the water, phoenixes mate , ducks play with balls sending sprays of water all around, fish are jumping and frogs make happy leaps . The 8 musicians play their instruments while 2 ladies sing and give narratives. Really a fantastic and magical performance very much appreciated by the audience."

The show lasts about 1 hour and i do not think is too much tourist's thing as i saw the 30% of guests were vietnamese (maybe not from Hanoi city...) This water puppies show based its roots in the ancient traditions of common people, so it acts the everyday activities plus mithes of pleasants. Chorus was great, absolutely...I found it very interesting and i went out excited at end of show! Is more than an attraction.. It's a work of art!Not to be missed!If taking seats in first lines you will be very close, but can happen you get wet ;-) just few drops not a thing to worry about!

The seats are granulated a little but it only take the people in front to take photos all the time and then show each other them to block your view.My husband was luckier and so I watched his video. It is very clever and you can follow the story quite easily. Ask for a front seat when booking or one at the back where you could stand up. All tickets have seat numbers on and do occasionally get mixed up.There is a notice that says you need to pay for a ticket to take photos but nobody seemed to take any notice."

It's all in Vietnamese so read the list of scenes first (they don't really flow into one another, it's more 'acts' than a story) so you have a clue what is going on. There's fireworks and action (cat catching a duck from the duck boy and quite a chase ensues and a fishing trip (or two) that gets dicey!) - you might not understand it but it's worth the trip. The cheap tickets are right at the back - if you want to take photos (you do need to pay about USD1 for this), get a tickets closer to the front as its quite dark so its hard to get a clear shot from the back."

It's easy to be a bit cynical about the folk/culture shows one comes across as a tourist, but this one really is a bit special. As we understand it, the water puppet shows were started centuries ago by the farming communities of Vietnam to provide some entertainment for the locals. This tradition has continued into modern times and is now offered for visitors at the Thang Long Puppet Theatre.The theatre has comfortable seating and everbody has a good view of the watery \"stage\" . The musicians are seated on a (dry!) platform to the left of the stage, providing accompaniment to the puppets on a range of traditional musical instruments. The show consists of a series of short performances from a wide range of puppet characters, playing out a selection of traditional water puppet performances. We had, for example, fire breathing dragons, rice planters, dancing fairies and Unicorns. Each performance was colourful, witty and brilliantly executed. The whole show is a little masterpiece of folk entertainment. I would thoroughly recommend paying the theatre a visit if your time in Hanoi allows it."

They are operated from behind a screen, as one would expect, and the show takes place in a large pool within the theatre, accompanied by a small orchestra playing traditional Vietnamese instruments, which they do with skill and accomplishment. Two of the girls attached to or in the orchestra also provide songs and other accompaniments to the scenes. The show itself consists of a sequence of short sketches dealing with aspects of Vietnamese country life, history and mythology. It would have been nice to have had, or to have been able to buy, explanations of the backgrounds to the scenes, even though a few were obvious. The show is well choreographed, and puppet handling, accompaniments, etc, are all done to high standards and seem to have been rehearsed/practiced thoroughly. This type of show is probably not something that one wants to see more than a couple of times but, equally, it is certainly well worth visiting."

The precise coordination, the well-rehearsed cues, the music, the singing etc. But what makes this special and different are the water puppets. That's not something you see everyday, and is easily worth your 5 bucks. The theater is located just next to the Hoan Kiem lake, and if you're in Hanoi you're somewhere around this area anyway. They have shows starting every hour or so, hence you can easily catch one if you're around.Now to the problematic bits...there should be a ban on recording in the theater, or people can pay extra to get a DVD of the show. Because what happens is there are always a bunch of people holding handicams above their head in the seat in front of you recording. Or taking big flash photos on their iphones. It can easily ruin the experience if you have someone like that near you. I would also have liked more details about what's going on somehow. Maybe a detailed transcript of the show for non-locals. Or headphones where you can hear the english translation. This is not hugely concerning since without this, you can still make out the overall structure roughly but it would be a great value addition. Lastly, for the seat allotment. I clearly asked the lady at the ticket counter to give me seats as close to the stage as possible and I booked very early relative to the show I wanted to go. But I still got seats 10 rows back! Overall, this still should be a part of your Hanoi tour and you shouldn't miss it."

Its not a big theatre so distance isnt an issue, the main problem is all the cameras that will be held up in front of you to block your view. You may get wet by accidental splashing but sitting in the first few rows would be my recommendation if you pay 100 anyways.Be prepared to have a camera in YOUR face. Not sure if its common or just a one time thing, but at the 630 show a man with a camera films the audience in a very bright light annoying way and also blocks the view of the band for a brief period. The show lasts for 45 minutes roughly. There is very little distance between rows, so if you are tall like myself be prepared for a little discomfort or sit sideways."

Thoroughly enjoyable. Just don't expect popcorn and usherettes, plus the seats are styled for Vietnamese-sized bodies!"

We had seats a couple of rows from the front but were also near the door. It was so frustrating to try and watch the show, when people kept coming in and then walking in front of you to get to their seats. They ended up making people sit in the front rows, which probably is one of the best spots to sit. The door was constantly left open, so light and noise would come in, hubby got up and closed it a few times. The lady in front of me had a big camera and was videotaping the show, but she was holding her camera up high, making it hard for me to see. I ended up asking her to put it down so that I could see the show myself. The show itself was okay, but we are not really into puppets. But the singing was beautiful. The puppets are part of the culture here, it was okay, but one we could have missed and not been worried about it. Reading the programme, made it easier to understand what was happening."

The comedy of some of the stories also translates well for this reason.Having read the reviews re the lack of leg room, when we bought our tickets I explained I was 6 feet tall and asked for appropriate seats. We got the front row which had ample room, and a great view, although looking back it did not seem too bad (I have been in more cramped theatres in the UK!). Wherever you sit the view will be fine anyway. The tickets were 100VND (about \u00a33), there are three or four performances every day (we went at 8pm) and this was my highlight of Hanoi - would definitely recommend and would be good for kids too.

All four of us nodded off at some point in the show, it did get a bit repetitive (dragons splashing round and round... fish splashing round and round... boats splashing round and round... then dragons again?) but some of the segments were gorgeous, the water fairies were cute and there was a nice sequence where rice was planted then grew and was harvested. I enjoyed the traditional singing and musical instruments but the seats were small and uncomfortable and at 45 minutes with repetition the show was just that little bit longer than the kids could bear. Maybe if you go early in the day and take some snacks, and make sure you read the pamphlet that comes with the tickets before the show so you know what each sequence is supposed to be about (it would be even better with more translation or someone providing more detailed explanations)."

Excellent and perfect harmony making the viewer feel that the puppets are actual humans , nothing artificial, brilliant.

Try to read up on water puppetry first as a lot of reviews posted on TripAdvisors seem to be by folks who have no understanding of what they are seeing.There's an excellent bookstore at 46 Tran Hung Dao that carries all sorts of books on Vietnamese culture by the Tre Gioi Publishing house. Even without script, sub/sur titles, the music and the vitality of the puppets is wonderful. Get your tickets several days ahead so that you can be up close, and potentially have some leg room. The seating is for Asian body, not the ones we possess. The seating is assigned, so no need to show up very early to the actual show."

However, it can be interesting for you to see the puppets, how the puppet operators control them over the water (for example, it was nice to see the puppets hitting the drums in sync with the music).

The art form itself is fun to watch: colorful puppets rising from a pool of water, manipulated by players hidden behind blinds. Live traditional music accompanies old mythical tales. The songs are all in Vietnamese, however, so if you don't master the language don't expect to be able to make much of what it's about. When the show ends, you've probably seen enough.Today, a brand new theater is right at Hoan Kiem lake and every day many bus loads of tourists are moved through the building quite efficiently for a series of shows. For Caucasian legs, seats are extremely tight, and the view may be partly blocked by dozens of fellow-tourists taking pictures or movies. Traditional art, in other words, in a not-so-very-traditional setting.,"

The show starts very well cause its unlike anything you've seen before, puppets dancing around in the water with very traditional music being played in a dimly lit background. Personally for me the novelty of this show was wearing off during the middle section of the play, but it picked up towards the last sections as they were some complicated puppet movements and multiple characters, with the tempo of the music changing. Overall it was worth a watch! and kudos to the team to have kept this show going on for several decades!"

They were great and without them the performance would have been bland.It's a shame that there was no pamphlet handed out or any translations given...the audience were mainly European...it was left to our own interpretations.Looking around the audience many were asleep...I have to admit I was bored.

The show is mostly about the life of Vietnamese in the old time with farming, fishing and showing the close-to-nature, simple, hardworking happy life of Vietnamese farmers. The songs praised the beauty of nature and people and the enthusiasm of working. Highly recommended for kids. This kind of puppet used to be the entertainment in some village in the north of Vietnam for Tet (new year) or other special occasions before we have TV and imported shows :D. I wish they could have made the show more various so people would have want to comeback, but now it's mostly for tourist :("

I bought my ticket for the latest show at 9:15pm just a few minutes before it started. I thought the show was charming and unusual. I liked how the water was not just a means to an end, i.e., a way to move the puppets, but also an important character in the shows. There were scenes of people cutting rice in the water and fishing. There were fish puppets and water dragon puppets, spraying water through their nostrils instead of fire.The live band playing Vietnamese traditional music was also a plus.The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the seating, While the seats were arranged on an incline, the incline was so slight that it was hard not to have your view blocked, especially if there were tall people sitting 1 or 2 rows in front of you."

Reserved numbered seats, the shows are very popular so make sure you book well in advance. Entertaining water puppet show comprised of about 20 short vignettes, so it doesn't get boring. Impressive what they can do; these are some of Vietnam's best puppeteers. The musical accompaniment gives you a flavour of Vietnamese music and singing."

The show is always popular but there is very little waiting time in the queue though pre booking is essential . The show takes place in a traditional theatre and even children have a good view due to the tiered seating. The stage is a mini lake and all the action takes place either on or under it. Different folk tales are enacted by wonderful large and very colourful puppets skilfully manipulated by a hidden cast. The best thing about this show is the traditional music played on traditional instruments by highly skilled musicians accompanied by haunting singing, all perfectly synchronising with the puppetry. The entrance fee was 100000 dong approx \u00a33 each for good seats and lasts about an hour. Could probably have done with more explanation of the story as I gather it tells the story of the sword in the lake in Hanoi centre"

The performance lasted approximately 50 minutes. For a small charge you were allowed to film or take pictures of the performance.

Even a 2 year old can understand that without the need to translate the songs into various languages. As for boring - I spent time trying to figure out how they control the puppet and other tricks and wondered how it was done. Won't give it away to you guys who have yet to watch it.Lastly though, I wished they ban all these wannabe photographers who kept on using flash. There was this woman who was next to me, photographed the show non stop, rotating between her digital compact camera, DLSR and phone and the flash lights were irritating.

I am not tall, but my knees had to be on an angle, and I still tipped the seat in front forward 10 degrees. We were about 15 rows back, which is a long way when the puppets are maybe 60 cm tall. The exit is more or less locked and concealed behind a black curtain during the performance, and extra chairs are placed in the access stairs, for that added degree of obstruction to exit. . The walls are timber coated in a gloss material, so this theatre meets my definition of a fire trap. The music and musicians were very good. There was no sur-titles or anything else in English, so I have no idea what the show was about, other than water dragons and water buffalos.

Although not in English, you will still laugh and smile at the show.Puppets will smoke, spray water and generally chase each other round. Very unique and very charming!"

After reading around a bit, and just the thought of puppetry didn\u2019t give us any sense of excitement, however my wife and I decided to give it a try. We were shocked at how hilarious it was. Also, the show had a certain line of though which anyone could follow easily. The show is cleverly done and exotic, among the best we experienced in Hanoi! They have really managed to get into a lot of history in these 45 minutes, the parts are small stories with classical Vietnamese music. The chairs were not very comfortable but they definitely good enough for how long the show is."

A fisherman choking on his pipe and a woman smacking a dude over the head with a fish net.The musicians sat to the side of the puppets and really brought the show to life, not only with their playing but also with their laughter as they genuinely appeared to enjoy the comedy moments of the show, despite no doubt having to do it 5 times a day for the whole of their living memory :)"

I mean there is nothing extraordinary, but apparently water puppet shows are \"very vietnamese\", and even though you don't understand what they sing, it is nice to see the performance of all those puppets dancing and fighting over the water... the colours, fire, songs, it makes it an interesting experience. They give out leaflets, so you know what's going on in each performance, e.g. a puppet returning a sword to the turtle god... it's cute and I bet children would love it. It's amazing how they control those puppets, it looks like they are doing everything on their own!"

They have a traditional instrument orchestra that opens the show on their own and then provides the music for the show. The idea of puppets in water was new to me and I really enjoyed it. The puppeteers told the story of how Vietnam was made by the dragon and then acted out the traditions of the tribes and villagers. You can also buy copies of the puppets. The seats are cheap and they perform 4 shows a day (afternoon and night). I'm not usually a puppet type of person however I enjoyed this show."

It would be even better if there had been a little more English to explain what was going on, but even not understanding the language you understood what was going on. The live musicians were fantastic and the puppeteers true masters! :-) Both me and my boyfriend are quiet tall, but surprisingly found the seats comfortable with enough leg room. I would definitely say, just enjoy the show and don't bother with cameras, or if you must then be courteous to others. We were very lucky in our showing but I heard from other people that flashes were going off all the time and they could not see the show for cameras.Best money we have spent so far in Vietnam! :-)"

For 80.000 for the \"cheap seat\" or 100.000 for premium seating ($4 and $5 US), you can spend another 20.000 for the privilege to take photos or movies.I first came here in May, 2012 and almost half of the time that I came to Ha Noi from Thai Binh Provence, 120 KM from Ha Noi (where I lived). The first show fascinated me. The music, very traditional, was mesmerizing. Watching the puppets in the water, well choreographed, presented aspects and stories of Vietnamese folklore, mythology and culture. Various regions and ethnic groups (there are, I think, 56 ethnic groups in Viet Nam) were represented.Where this art form originated was in the field where water-grown rice is worked. The water is usually only about a couple of feet deep at the most. Somewhere, someone put up lanterns , put puppets on long sticks and had a cast of water marionettes to move them around in the water. Certainly, the first puppets were quite primitive with no moving parts. As time went on, different small animations were added: arm and tail movement, turning heads, all rather repetitive, but which could be done in rhythm to the music.There are actually three shows (an hour or so each) in their repertoire that are rotated every two yeRs. So far, I have had the privilege to see two of them. In another 16 months, I will get to see the third!This is very enjoyable. They sell CDs of the music . I don't remember the price, but the price for each is about $10 US (200.000 VND or less).You can't miss,but you should get reservations ahead of time during the tourist high season (not in September or during the cold months from late December to mid-February). You may ant to arrange with your agent and hotel to get you tickets at the times you would like, from the afternoon until late evening. If you are backpacking or going it alone, you will need to go to the ticket office on your first day and get tickets when convenient for you. The theater, if looking at a map, is off of the NW corner of Hoan Kien Lake at the Old Quarter."

The puppetiers behind the curtain did a good job, although I would not describe them as very skilled or extraordinary. I think everybody can do this job with some practice. Not comparable with real artists or dancers on stage or other puppetiers (e.g. Augsbuger Puppenkiste, Germany).Overall the show was quite boring and both my wife and I almost fell asleep. We suggest to skip this part of Hanoi and better spend the money in a bar at the corner watching the Vietnamese street life. Much more interesting and you won't get bored even after 5+ hours...:)"

The venue is a new air-conditioned theatre, complete with screens for sur-titles and high quality lighting, sound and even effects like dry ice. The puppets themselves are the same quaint, wooden marionettes controlled via underwater strings and rigs, but the show's content seems to have changed too; instead of tales from the rice paddies we get a Vietnamese creation myth and episodes incorporating the country's ethnic minorities. It feels as though some government ministry has swept through and insisted on tweaking the content to make it even more wholesome and nationalistic, as if that had been necessary.But my biggest problem was the behaviour of the audience. People not only chatted through the performance as if they were at the pub, many used the iPads and DSLRs indiscrimately, and with flashes, as if watching the performance was immaterial - all that mattered was creating a record of the fact that they came. No matter if holding their screens up and using bright flashes in the dark auditorium affected others' enjoyment of the performance. Worse, they were doing this with the approval of the venue, who charge a fee for the right."

            "review": "Not for me. I arrived in Vietnam the day before my visit to the Water Puppet Theatre and therefore was enthusiastic and fully refreshed for this visit. The show commenced at 5pm with the Theatre itself resembling that of a normal Picture Theatre. Upon arrival, I found out that if you wanted to take photos,it would cost a fee. Although only $1, I was a little taken aback.In fact, I think I only took 3 photos as sitting up towards the back of the Theatre, I was to far away to get good shots,plus I felt using a flash would be distracting to those around me. Once the show got under way,I settled back to enjoy the entertainment. Although interesting for the first 15 minutes or so, I soon lost interest as it became rather repetitive. Sitting up towards the back probably didn't help,as it seemed you needed binoculars to see the finer art of the puppetry.Anyway,the show finished just under an hour which to my way of thinking was about 30 minutes too long. I have no doubt the costumes,carpentry,skills of the performers/operators was first class but it just wasn't my scene.Maybe it was the 65 year old male in me coming out! I was with a tour group which comprised about 25-30 people of mixed sexes, and I believe the consensus of quite a number,particularly the males that they shared my views,and perhaps we could have spent our time elsewhere. By the way,the Theatre was air conditioned."

The music, musicians and musical instruments were unique and fabulous. I had a 2nd row seat and was trying very hard not to fall asleep after the first 15 minutes. The story lines (translated onto a TV screen during the show) were vague and all the performances blended into each other. The hour long show seemed never ending! Costs only $6, so was worth the visit for its uniqueness, though I wish I could have sneaked out after the first 15 minutes without appearing rude! This show would probably be most enjoyed by very young children. I felt badly for the water puppeteers as the enthusiasm in the audience was low."

Eventhough we have seen another water puppet show in a village on our Vietnam trip, I really loved the water puppet theatre in Thang Long theatre. The musicians where great, the puppets where more colourful than on the other show we have seen. And at the end, it is a part of authentic vietnamese culture. Unfortunately it is also a part of each and every Hanoi city tour what leads to the problem, I had with it. The theatre was full but the audience was so ungreatful, loud, nobody applauded when the orchestra showed up, they barely applauded at the end of the show. A lot of smartphones and even tablets were hold overheads and interrupted the sight for those who said behind. I guess, many of those people did not really see the value in this play, they only took it as another (boring) part of a standard citytour. I bet, lot\u00b4s of them have never been to a theatre before and had no idea, how to behave. The show lasts about 50 minutes, I will never understand, why it is so hard for adult people just to sit down, shut up and listen for 50 minutes.That is really a pity and it made me said for the musicians and artists that are really doing a great job."

We had excellent seats in the centre of the second row. Something to be aware of - if you want to take photos, you need a separate ticket to be able to do that, although I'm not so sure that anyone would know if you had it or not. When I was taking photos I wasn't asked about it. Also, know your camera - it's dark,so you need to be able to operate it in the dark, and how to take low light photos."

The stage has been removed and replaced with an in-ground swimming pool on which the small puppets perform. Local ladies sing and play the music accompanying each performance and there is a description of each performance translated into English on the LCD TV screen either side of the stage at the star of each performance. It reminded me of the puppet scene in the sound of music but sung in Vietnamese and performed on water instead of a stage.

They are charged extra (this is not enforced) to annoy other people with their flashes, only to end up with some second rate videos and photos. The girls next to me had their views completely blocked by a woman holding her video camera above her head for 80% of the performance. The picture quality that I could see was terrible - are her friends and relatives really going to watch it anyway? You can see other peoples' low quality films on youtube.

Im a tall fellow and I have to say my knee caps were feeling it by the end. Obviously built with the slight physiques of the Vietnamese in mindSecondly, the audience. Behind and infront of me I had some inconsiderate oaths with hulking great slrs blinding me temporarily throughout. Perhaps not such a bad thing.

This popular and very professional theatre show is situated at the end of Hoan Kiem Lake closest to the Old Quarter. Be warned - you will generally need to purchase your tickets days beforehand to secure your preferred date and performance time. Large tour buses bring dozens of people and on the night of the performance I recommend you arrive early to have time to visit the bathroom and take a look at the interesting display of character puppets on the first floor.The ticket office advertises that if you want to take photographs you will have to pay more but I found that no one checked anyway. In fact, half of the theatre goers hold up their ipads for long periods of time, taking video footage, which thoughtlessly blocks or distracts the view of those sitting behind. VERY annoying.The show itself is charming and the puppet masters work their craft hidden behind bamboo screens, with the brightly coloured puppets skipping and dipping across the water stage, accompanied by a traditional instrumental group and a couple of very impressive vocalists. The whole performance includes nine different small pieces which tell various stories of life in the countryside, courting, food production, the significance of fans, and the culture of different ethnic groups. There are plenty of cafes and street stalls nearby so it's easy to quickly grab something to eat before or after the show. Try a coconut ice cream if you can."

Tickets are inexpensive, maybe VND 100K? Book early to get good seats. Show runs for around 40 minutes so dinner before or after is easy.  It's a shame they allow late arrivals and flash photography. We had a few bus loads arrive 10 - 15 minutes late. They didn't enter quickly or quietly, and then proceeded to take flash photos. Has no-one ever explained to them how utterly pointless (and annoying) is to use flash from so far back. After the show stay in your seats for five minutes and allow the pushy tour groups to empty - if you stand between them and their buses parked outside you risk being trampled. Relax and enjoy."

Apparently, this is a new production fairly recently revamped to focus on ethnic minorities in Vietnam and some of their cultural practices (e.g. hunting fish, playing pan pipes & holding umbrellas for courtship, etc). The Vietnam legend part was just at the start with the dragon & phoenix and the egg that produced 100 sons who became the Vietnamese people. The stage and music were great/unique and the puppets charming but without a dramatic storyline to tie all the segments together, it was not a particularly dynamic show, apart from some interesting puppetry (e.g. puppets spinning umbrellas). It's worth a visit for the novelty of seeing a live water puppet set/show, the live ancient instruments & singing. A few of my students nodded off (to be fair, we had just arrived in Hanoi a few hours earlier from 13 hours of travel from San Francisco, CA)."

Each puppet theme is created uniquely and artistically which matched the Vietnamese music. I love the sound of the harp (i hope i got the name of the instrument right) and the sweet voice of the lady singer and narrator. The english translation of the narration on the screen is such a great help for the foreigners. The show is also priced reasonably and started and ended as scheduled. The kids really enjoyed the show."

It was only my respect for other people and the musicians that I refrained from getting up and walking out.Yes, we had front row seats, so I can't argue and it was 100,000 dong per person, so only \u00a36 overall...HOWEVER...The whole thing seemed to be one giant tourist trap, stated by agents and tour guide and travel books as something cultural, ageing back centuries, but it was awful.The first 10 minutes were good, but once you've seen one dance, you've seen them all!The puppets were in a shocking state and I realise that they only last one average 3 months due to, obviously, water damage, but surely they can afford to given their faces a coat of paint with the amount of mugs like myself packing out the auditorium 4 times a day. They (the puppets) all appeared to have severe facial disfigurements.The music was fabulous and I wish I could give the musicians 5 stars for their performance, because they were wonderful, and if the show had just been them on the stage performing for 45 minutes I would have come away a lot happier!!!Don't bother!"

The puppetry scenes are interspersed with explanations shown on TV screens beside the pool/stage, often with great examples of Engrish - the local people being 'attacked by the Evil Beats' being one of my favourites!All in all, this is a fairly inexpensive hour of amusement. But book early if you want to go - all the evening shows were full when I went, but luckily I could just squeeze into the lunch performance.

Value for money is a guarantee, as something like this in the West would probably run over 30 dollars per person. The theater room titself is a bit crowded and the chairs really close together. The puppet show is really informative with background information written in English on a large screen to explain the difference scenes of the show. The live music is really nice. The puppets themselves are very well crafted and the puppeteers are very skilled. My 2 year old loved it as well!"

This is a live performing art where puppeteers hide behind a screen and move the wooden puppets using bamboo stick. The puppeteers usually perform in a waist-deep pool. Live music is also played together during these performances. We manage to catch the 3pm show which lasted for 45 minutes. The entrance ticket cost us USD10 for 2. There are 2 type of tickets. The expensive one which you get to sit near the front and the less expensive which sit at the back. I would recommend to go early and purchase your tickets early because this is a very popular show. Tickets sells out very very fast!! Faster than hot cakes."

There is a live orchestra, playing traditional music on traditional instruments, which is absolutelty lovely & the ladies that sing are wonderful, quite enchanting to watch them play & at the same time haunting to listen to.We couldn't help but think that if The Beatles had heard the sounds, then they would have been influenced by them, just as they were by the sitar & other ethnic music!Well worth a visit for those that are sceptcical, as we were!"

I would suggest putting any cyniscm aside, not expect anything overly sophisticated and go learn about some Vietnamese culture and history while being entertained by some wonderful artists, at approximately USD5, and one hour, you don't have much to lose if you do make the investment!"

I did see some people sleeping in the 8pm show, but our four-year-old made it through, so I guess it was interesting enough!"

The water puppet art is still well worth seeing, but the show was a little lacklustre this time (I've seen shows previously in Hanoi and HCMC), and lacked the humour of the ones I've seen before. Still a fascinating art form and the puppeteers and musicians are very skilled."

There were many repetitive moments although the puppets wore different costumes. The puppets are also quite worn out. If you have time to spare, you may consider watching this show. Otherwise, I think exploring the street food, walking by the lake would be of a better option."

It was a show describing the history of evolution of Vietnam in decades; it also demonstrated the different culture of different parts of Vietnam. At the left corner of the dias, the singers and the orchestra were sitting playing instruments and singing and describing the puppet dance; vis-a-vis at the right corner a TV monitor was giving brief in english as to what will be displayed next. In the centre of dias was the big pool of water upon which the puppet show took place. The puppets were placed on a bamboo and their parts were moving with threads fixed with the bamboo; whole time the bamboo was being moved from the back behind a curtained area by some expert puppeteers. They were saying this type of water puppet show is only one of its kind in the world! I don't know how far that is true but it was definitely a new and unique experience for me!"

Book ahead if you want good seats, as the best seats tend to go to groups.Plus points: You can see as well as hear the musicians on either side of the stage, and the music is excellent. Lighting and stage effects are also very good.The performance is fast-paced, and is all over in about 45 minutes - so it is not over-long for children.Less positive: The program packs in a great deal about Vietnamese cultural history and cultural diversity. The content was interesting in itself, but one feels the heavy hand of the Party and of political correctness: the message is clearly that VietNam is ONE nation and always has been. By contrast, I found the performances in the smaller water puppet theatre in Saigon much fresher and more creative,"

I had previously seen this troop when they visited Adelaide for a Festival of Arts some years ago. On their home ground the performers occupy a purpose built theatre with great accoustics and every seat offers a good view. Very tight for legroom though. The show itself is a series of 10 or so vignettes, drawing on stories from myth and religion as well as Vietnamese rural life. The performance is accompanied by traditional instruments, played with polish and flair by the resident musicians and singers. Photos are allowed, and there is no need to pay the extra money asked. Just go ahead. Overall, a great way to spend an hour with the kids."

            "review": "So much better 4 years ago.... I went to Hanoi 3 times in late 2008 and early 2009, and went to the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre each time. It was the same show but I thoroughly enjoyed it (why would I go 3 times in 7 months if I didn't!). The acts were varied, interesting, and incredibly humorous--Kids swimming, lots of parades, funny animals -- I don't recall any story based on legends, no real linkage between the acts. Just good fun, with background music that I remember to this day. I enjoyed it so much that after my third visit, I actually purchased one of the puppets that they sell in the lobby -- And I don't tend to purchase souvenirs, ever!I was in Hanoi last week for another work-related trip, and looked forward to paying another visit to the puppet theatre -- I heard that the program had changed: But was I ever disappointed. The dragon and swan duo at the beginning was cute, but the remainder of the program was stifling: The various acts were supposedly based on the day-to-day lives of people in the different provinces, but the puppetry essentially consisted of figures bobbing up and down in the water swinging their arms. Like so many others, I dozed off intermittently throughout, I found it so boring. It was like the puppeteers behind the curtains were putting in the least effort they could (again, compared with the past). I found the whole performance to be Incredibly uncreative, and I felt sad, as the various acts used to be so varied and sparkling.Bring back the old! Or if that's not possible, I hope they re-tool the acts significantly. Next time I'm in Hanoi, I'll be visiting the puppet theatre at the Ethnographic Museum, which I've heard is more \"authentic\"."

We went to a 5pm showing the other day and were entertained enough for the 45 minutes or so of the show. Just about worth a $3 seat to see it for its unique cultural experience, but not much more since the novelty of seeing water puppets wears off quite quickly and not all the puppets seem to work (or the puppeteers are being lazy behind those curtains). There is a Vietnamese commentary with English language screens narrating the show, although there are so many tourists and so few locals that it should probably be the other way around.However the start, which was probably the best bit from what we saw (the bit with the dragon) and should have been the novelty part being something we've never seen before, was completely ruined because two or three coachloads of tourists took their seats in the four rows in front of us after the performance had begun (filing in from the door noisily and disturbing more than just the back rows I'm sure). There's a cafe downstairs so no doubt the theatre or their tour guides were encouraging coffee consumption, but there's no excuse for missing the start. They didn't even rush to their seats but noisily talked their way in, despite there being music. Maybe these tourists were just complete morons, maybe it was their tour guides fault, maybe it was the fault of the theatre. No excuse for it happening though. Grumble grumble grumble."

A large rod supports the puppets under the water and is used by the puppeteers who are hidden behind a screen. Seeing the puppets tell the story really was amusing.

I greatly enjoyed the performance with the highly intricate puppets and can only imagine the skill it takes. The music and singing is also high quality and completes the entire experience. If you go to Vietnam, you really need to see this. The show is relatively quick and it's easy to work into a day touring around Hanoi. That said, the seats leave much to be desired. If you are more than 6'2', you will not be physically able to put the seat down! I'm taller than that, so I had to move to one of the folding chairs along the side stairs. It was awkward, but in the end, a superior seat as I had much more room. This is also the kind of thing that attracts the worst kind of package tourists unfortunately. There was a group in the front few rows that held up their cameras and video recorders for almost the entire performance I cannot imagine what it was like for the people directly behind them. Given the amount of international tourist traffic going through Vietnam, it would be worth the effort for this theater to remodel the seats to be slightly larger and with more viewing pitch. My recommendation. If you can see water puppet theater somewhere else in Vietnam in a more pleasant environment, go for it, even if it's an inferior troop. But if you're in Hanoi and this works into your schedule, just go into it knowing what to expect. It's a worthy yet highly touristic tick the box experience."

Scenes may have had both historic and legendary backgrounds, as I recollect. Are there many other puppet theaters in Vietnam? I don't know.

Leg room is virtually non existent - I'm 6'5\" and I felt like a sardine. Each ticket sold has a row and seat number handwritten on it which you aren't made aware of when you buy so always ask for the front row if you can. The puppets aren't huge so closer to the front also benefits your enjoyment.Secondly - now you know that you have a booked seat you don't have to take part in the awful scrum to get in. We were split, jostled, pulled and pushed on the way in and there really is no need once everyone realises that they have allocated seats.The show itself lasts about 40 minutes and is fine. There is a subtitled narrative and the puppets act out what has just been said accompanied by some good local music. Ok, the puppets are cleverly put together and skilfully operated but I was over that in five minutes, after which I got back to concentrating on how to sit more comfortably in my small seat. I don't want to belittle the puppeteers as it's obviously skilful just not really my cup of tea.The show tickets were pretty cheap but I've seen it now and don't feel the need to return."

It's not expensive so go do it... but don't expect too much."

But that's the fact, just 10 minutes ok.... Not really a fan of the puppet but the music very pleasant to my ears. I like the music more than the puppet. Try to open my eyes but with the air-cond, the music and the darkness it just a perfect time to zzzzzzzzzzzz....."

Put on for masses of tourists each day, this is but a watered down version of the real thing. It is not bad -- but far from excellent, but everyone goes down to the lakeside theatre without knowing this is not in fact the Vietnamese national water puppet company, an organization of excellence to be found a few miles away.I've been to both shows, and the one from the national company is far more skillful and fun too. You get dragons that snort real fire and an authentic full-sized traditional orchestra as well. There is great subtlety in puppet manipulation too. The setting -- outdoors in the middle of buildings -- is more attractive also.The audience at the national theatre is mixed Vietnamese and foreign -- far fewer foreign tourists come here than to the other show, and they seem to be on high-end packages whose guides know where to find the real thing for their clients. The show is in Vietnamese whereas the Thang Long has an English commentary -- however, understanding the words is not essential to experiencing the drama or enjoying the sheer sorcery of a puppet running its fingers over a flute while a real one is played offstage...The Nha Hat Mua Roi Viet Nam is at 361 Truong Chann in Hanoi and has daily shows at 5 and 6:30 pm. I recommend the 6:30 pm as there is particular magic after it starts getting dark. Traffic is bad, so allow plenty of time to get to the show from central Hanoi."

We had a whinging Chinese lady in our row who wanted the fan off because she was cold. I could see sweat running down others faces so I bribed the usher to leave it on (20k VND). The other bad thing (no fault of the theatre), was all the people in the 40-60 age bracket holding up iPads trying to record the whole show.

The show is well done with broad explanation given in the program and on tv screens of each act. However it is clearly predominantly targeted for the tourist audience which is all the more surprising that the seats are uncomfortable. Anyone more than aporox 1.80 or 5ft 11 will have their knees up against the seat in front. I assume this is one reason some find the show too long winded as clearly it is more difficult to enjoy when in building pain! Nevertheless the show is entertaining, professionally produced and worth the pain! The only seats without constraints are the first row (Row A) although I suspect these are snapped up by the tour groups. When I went all shows were fully booked for the next 48 hrs so if you are passing through Hanoi eg en route Halong Bay, make it a priority to book your tickets first. I was told (but can't confirm) that last minute tickets can be got at the door as some tour companies return their unused tickets. Certainly the day I attended there were quite a few empty seats in the first 3 rows ..... As an alternative you could consider visiting the Ethnology museum. It is worth the effort (see separate review) and has the bonus of putting on its own water puppet shows at 10,1130, 230 & 4 when I was there. These are in daylight, certainly more comfortable to watch (you pull up a plastic chair to watch) and more authentic in the sense that the majority of the audience is Vietnamese and clearly love it. Either way a water puppet show is worth seeing!"

Choose the front row so, you will get very good view. The show was not projected on the screen so you may not see properly if you are sitting behind.I just loved the colourful stage and the musicians and narrators in traditional costumes. Although the narration was in Vietnamese, we could refer to the translation at the two screens by the side of the stage. Or we just referred to the brochure in English/Chinese that we took outside the hall. So, understanding the show was not a problem for us.Till the end of the show, we were presented the puppeteers behind the show. They were all dipped in water (till waist height) throughout the show.

In our sleep-deprived, jet-lagged state we naively didn't check the face-value until we were being seated in the back row - not the best view as some of the puppets are quite small - and then it turned out we'd been sold 60,000 VND tickets (and offered no change in case, like us, you're trying to find the honest mistake).

However after several of these scenes, the performance becomes rather repetitive. It is roughly 45 minutes long and is a good opportunity to escape the weather outside.

It gives you a quick glimpse into Vietnamese culture.A few tips:Go early in the morning to get your tickets. Have the ticket seller show you what seats are left for the times you're interested in (it's assigned seating). Pick a show that you can sit near the front of the theater. Everybody takes pictures and the fewer flashes and iPads you have in front of you, the more you;ll enjoy the show."

It was interesting to see the puppets and hear the music although the movements were cruder than I expected. The design of the theatre is flawed \u2013 the gradient of the seating is not steep enough and it's hard to see the tiny puppets over people's heads.

As the title suggests, the strings are pulled by underwater operators while a dazzling light display adds a colorful background; a chorus and small orchestra provide musical companionship, and a narrator tells the story. The latter was generally na\u00efve communist propaganda --------- grasping landowners and heroic peasants; the son of a shoemaker getting the better of a wealthy young aristocrat; the lazy member of the commune who is banned from the Annual Outing, left behind, and single-handedly saves the precious crops when a vicious tornado suddenly strikes. Or simple fairy stories about good versus evil that make Hans Andersen and the Brothers Grimm seem ultra-sophisticated. If I were a censor, I would have given the show a special rating: Persons Over the Age of 15 Prohibited. Yet the theatre was packed, mostly with adults of which only a minority had brought their children along. It struck me that there is a lot of cultural naivete in this part of the world."

Your search of Vietnamese culture would not be complete without visiting the Thang Long Water Puppet Theater located in Hoam Kiem district. The theater hosts shows thrice daily at 5.15 PM, 6.30 PM, and 8 PM. Highly skilled puppet shows not only attract children but their elderly counterparts as well. Depicting the country life in Vietnam and re-living numerous ancient tales leading with the legend of the Hoan Kiem Lake, it will give visitor a glimpse into the inner side of the Vietnamese culture and tradition. Viewers will be mesmerized at the use of simple tools like bamboo poles for extending the puppets from the backside of proscenium and the expertise with which the performers handle the puppets. Unique feature of the theater is that the viewing could be better from the middle or back rows instead of the front rows in the theater hall."

A short synopsis accompanies each act so you know what it's meant to be about but really, it's just nice to watch.For $3 at it's cheapest there isn't anything to loose by giving it a go.

You'll hear traditional music, see the traditional water puppets, and bruise your knees on the chair in front of you. For 5 minutes, it's an interesting cultural experience. At 10 minutes, you realize they spent the entire special effects budget in the first 5 minutes, and that the remainder of the show is made up of puppets of people doing traditional dances/activities/ceremonies of various Vietnamese people.The issue here is sadly not with the product - these guys sell out multiple performances a day and have a great reputation. The issue is that this medium is frankly not that interesting, that the puppets are traditional and therefore incredibly limited in their range of movement, and consequently, most segments of the performance are frustratingly repetitive.My girlfriend paid $3 for a good snooze.

Was this a fascinating insight into Vietnamese culture? Yes, absolutely. Was this good entertainment? Definitely.If you're interested in culture and/or you like the fine arts, you should enjoy this show. It's a bit like watching Vietnamese fairy tales or folk stories acted out, and even if you can't follow the story it's fascinating looking at the way the puppeteers make their little characters move. Sometimes it's even quite emotional. The Vietnamese orchestra and singing is masterful and interesting. The puppets are sweet, and the puppeteers very skilled. Considering they were wading about in utterly freezing water -- I popped my hand in after the show, and it was really cold -- it's incredible how perfectly choreographed and delicate the puppets' movements were. It was great theatre.I wanted to take photos, which is OK so long as you buy an extra 'photo' ticket. The hotel concierge bought the ticket for me and I begged him to get me a front row seat. He couldn't manage that, but he did organise an 'extra chair' seat at the bottom of the aisle on the right of the theatre. This was great. Better still, someone in the front row got up and left, so I ended up with a front row seat after all. I got amazing pix!I really recommend this if you're wanting to understand local culture and a bit of real Vietnamese tradition."

The show's just under and hour, and that's enough. The puppets are charming, and there's an informative narrative introducing each of the 10 short scenes. It's in Vietnamese, but there are screens on either side of the stage which have the English translation. The narrator and musicians seem to be stifling yawns and wishing they could check their cell phones throughout the show, so keep your attention on the puppets themselves and you'll enjoy yourself more!"

Traffic to get there for the 5pm show was HORRIFIC but we embraced the experience chatting as best we could to our Buffalo Tour 'guide' who was very well informed and helpful with university English. We arrived for the last 1/3 of the puppet show but 3 out of 4 of us were relieved at the brevity of our puppet experience. Perhaps we missed out on the 'flow' of the full experience but I doubt it. We have since been informed (not sure how valid) that the theatre we went to is the second of the same 'company' for when the other is booked out. We booked at least two months in advance!?"

I thought this was a big shame and disrepectful and distracting. Apart from that I enjoyed this show very much and would even go again.As for the comments about tall people, I am not one but I could imagine having your legs a bit crampt for 45mins so you get a view over the top of people's heads is worth it.

This should be banned."

There are singers and a live orchestra and there is a small introduction to each scene in Vietnamese with English subtitles on the screen which is great. The water puppets are an old art so yes they won't be doing super whizzy but it is rather enchanting and visually appealing to watch.

The show itself was clever and the music is good but not my cup of tea I'm afraid. The best bit was when the the people came out out into the water at the end and you realise how small the puppets are...a great optical illusion. It's probably worth checking out as something different to do in Hanoi but if you're tall be careful when you sit down! The people that insist on videoing the show are annoying because they block the view of the people behind them. it must also be irritating for the musicians and the puppeteers to look out and see mobile phones, video recorders etc. Why anybody would want to watch the show a second time on their video player is beyond me.

There are large screens with English translations to explain the upcoming scenes. Then the scenes are played out by the puppets and live ethnic music.I was intrigued with how the puppets were made to move and the first scene was pretty cool, seeing a puppet dragon 'swim' across the theater. But about half in the show, it can lose its initial appeal and the scenes become similar to the previous ones and end up becoming a bit boring. It ran for almost an hour, I think it was enough.Be ready for the tiny seats. There's not much leg room and it can be uncomfortable. Be sure to visit the john before taking a seat. It will be cumbersome to take a leak especially when you are seated in the middle.Have a later dinner at Cha Ca La Vong or do some shopping after as the theater is in the Old Quarters."

While the theater setting was larger and looked better care for it was not as complicated or interesing a set up as the Saigon one. The Saigon one actually had better puppeteers and more interesting puppets. You can also see the musicians better in Saigon. Only drawback is that the Saigon theater did not provide explanation of the skits...I hope they change that...even as someone who understands Vietnamese I had a hard time understanding the stories.....as a Vietkieu."

The outside weather was cool but the temperature inside the theater was oven hot, humid & stinky due to the exceptionally poor ventilation and non-functional air-conditioner. I wanted to leave immediately but couldn't do so as there was hardly any gap for me to squeeze out along the row of seats. The seats were designed for people less than 50Kg with no spare leg room. Those who are above 50Kg will definitely be squeezed by the front seat. I landed with a serious migrain after the show. Should there be a fire, I am sure all will die of a stampede!The show was just so-so. I would strongly recommend to you not to waste your time and money and above all to suffer for 60 minutes which seems like 100 years."

Almost all tourists will visit it during their stay in Vietnams capital. Supposedly water puppetry is a treasured (folk) art form with a rich and varied repertoire performed by skilled musicians and puppeteers. Yeah, supposedly.In reality it's only 'performed' (to flattering a word) for an audience of foreign tourists (no Vietnamese will turn up there!) most of which are to bored, drunk or uncultured to recognize the tired, spurious and abysmally bad pageantry for what it is: a nasty first grade tourist trap. It's difficult to say what is worst. So many things are competing for the bottom rung! Is it the rundown ramshackle theater itself with its threadbare dirty carpet and fatigued tip-up chairs? Is it the fact that the 'singers' lip sync the whole thing? Is it the sad special effects (stroboscope light and smoke machine)? Is it the ONE creepily cheerful and maniacally enthusiastic puppeteer (who really believes in what he does!) at the end of the show while the rest of the performers seem to be embarrassed to the bone about what they've just done? No, it must be the 'story' itself: an endless string of tired clich\u00e9s and hyper-nationalistic anal-cramp-inducing bog wash produced by the propaganda division of the Vietnamese Communist Party. Is it really THAT bad? I assure you: it really is!But that doesn't mean you shouldn't go there. In fact I urge you to go. Happily Vietnam is changing. And it's changing quickly. This might just be your last change to see this kind of propaganda anywhere in the world. So go and have a laugh!"

The theater is located across the street from Hoan Kiem lake in the Old Quarter and tickets cost about 60,000 dong (~$2.25). The theater seats are pretty cramped (my knees were against the seat in front of me; I'm 5'10\") but the show is only an hour, so it's bearable. There are video screens that translate the Vietnamese narrative into English and the accompanying music was great; however, I would have enjoyed seeing the instruments and musicians play rather than them being behind a curtain. My one criticism during the show is that there appeared to be a lot of inconsistencies between the abilities or functionality of the water puppets. Some puppets were very physically agile and in-sync with the music, while others seemed lethargic and off-beat. We couldn't identify whether it was the fault of the puppeteer or the puppets needing some work; either way, it seems as though professionals would find it unacceptable and want it corrected.Overall, I would definitely recommend checking out the show; however, I would also recommend the company looking into correcting some of the performance inconsistencies."

There will be a stage with a pool of water where the handmade wooden puppets, coated with waterproof paint, dance with the music and song serenaded by a group of musicians at the left hand side of the stage. The stories and dances depict the cultures and history of Vietnam. The movements and gestures protrayed by the puppets in the water look lively and funny. There are several preludes in the programme. Each prelude has its distinctiveness. Believe me, even you don't get what the song is all about, somehow, the figurines will give you a sense of the storyline. Enjoy!"

The show was presented very well but it could have been a bit better if they had explained before or after about how the puppeteers worked. It was very enjoyable but I was curious to know more about the process. Don't expect to get good pictures unless you are in the first few rows."

I've been to the Water Puppets maybe 6 times, whenever I visit Ha Noi with friends. It has evolved over the last four years and is much more glitzy.

Was a good show and I would recommend it. Great for children. Our energy-filled three year old was entranced for the whole hour! Singing was lovely, music was beautiful, and the show was interesting. Be sure to grab an English version of the guide on your way in so that you can read what each scene is in reference to."

Positives; 1. It's cheap, we paid US$6 for two tickets in the middle of the theatre. 2. It's short, 45 minutes so it's easy to fit into a packed day. 3. You will laugh because you don't know what the heck is going on. 4. You will learn a small amount of Vietnamese culture. Negatives; 1. Even thow there are some English subtitles at the begining of each act everything else is in Vietnamese so you really don't have any idea about what's going on.2. Super small seats, I'm 6ft and could not fit into the seat comfterablely. I was lucky no one was sitting in front of me so I could pop my legs over into the spare seat, still wasn't that comfy. "

We got the cheap seats at the back, the seats are close together so anyone with long legs will have their knees pressed up against the seats infront.The music, singing and puppetry is excellent. At the end of the performance, those who worked the puppets come out from behind the screen. Outside the theater room are a huge variety of puppets they use that can been seen up close.

But in the final analysis, it's also an hour of watching 'unseen' puppeteers recreating incomprehensible traditional Vietnamese folk stories, in Vietnamese, thrashing around in water to the accompaniment of a cacophanous migraine-inducing band. I guess if you're really really short of something to do, or you're a culture-vulture, this could be a great way to while away an hour. But we're philistines, and the pubs were open so we lasted maybe 15 minutes..."

He didn\u2019t really enjoy it. I thought it was a good way to get a little feel for old Vietnamese stories. It is quite impressive what they can do with these puppets and was a good way to spend an hour in the evening. Do book ahead, at least a few hours in advance or more as some other people in our hotel couldn\u2019t get tickets for the night, booking early evening. I also know of others who couldn\u2019t get tickets the whole time they were in Hanoi. It is a good evening but not essential to your Hanoi trip."

I am pleased to have had the experience but would not say it s a \" must do\". If you are tall, ask for an end or front seat for comfort as 45 mins crammed saw many uncomfortable people. Respectfully, the venue was built inthe 1950's I was told, for local people. It was a joy to watch these children really enjoying the performance with their extended families."

The show is in Vietnamese but there were 2 smallish screens in the front which translated what was happening into English. Music is provided by a live orchestra playing Vietnamese instruments and there were a number of different cultural items performed. They started with how the Vietnamese people originated from the union of a dragon and a heavenly being (although it looked more like a bird) and then went on to showcase life in the rural areas, some of the different ethnic tribes and the effect of Indian influence on Vietnam. Since it is unique to Vietnam and so inexpensive, it is worth seeing once. It does get monotonous at times and the people next to us left halfway through. However the last part is possibly the most interesting so you should stay till the end."

The movement of the puppets are really good and amazing, there are exhibitions that are awesome. You can take pictures of the show with no additional cost.

It's an extra 20,000 to use a camera and 60,000 for video but as others have said- this isn't policed. The show is a collection of 10 or so sets with Vietnamese narration. There are 2 large screens with English translation so unless you can't read, there is no way you can't follow the 'story'. The music is truly terrible so earplugs may be advisable. The 1st set is by far the best so if you don't get on with that I advise you to walk out because it gets very boring! The puppets are shockingly bad and the movements repetitive, hence the boredom. Some parts are so terrible we could barely contain our laughter! Who ever wrote that you would die if you used the toilets needs their head checked- they are perfectly fine. The theatre is nicely air conditioned which provides a nice 45 min break from the heat of hanoi. I can't say I enjoyed the whole experience but I'm glad I went to see what all the fuss is about.

The water puppet theater highlighted the rich culture of Vietnam and their Chinese heritage as well. Though the puppet movements were in rhythm with the rich musical background from the orchestra of traditional instruments, the entire play was narrated in Vietnamese that made the story line hard to follow and thus bland and repetitive. Some of the water puppets also need some repairs or replacements due to noticeable dents and deformities."

The show is comprised of about 10 (maybe less) very short stories. It is worth it to get a closer seat. Though the puppetry wasn't perfect and the stories were simple, we had fun watching this show. It would be great for kids, too. The seats are not made for western bodies, but sitting in the front row is more comfortable. I agree that it's not worth it to pay for the camera pass, as the photos don't turn out. Get the tickets ahead if you can and you'll be there during a busy time (such as August). The show was about 45-50 minutes long. This show is much better than the free one offered at the Museum of Ethnology on weekends."

The music is good, better than I expected without the usual twang of a one string instrument in other cultures. I had some hesitation in going to this based on some reviews and almost skipped it because of a rain storm but glad I didn't. Pay for the 100,000 dong vs the 60,000 dong seats if you have a choice.

Obviously by very good musicians as the sound and how they were played was great.The show lasts for only a short time in which there are traditional stories played out via wooden puppets in the water. I didn't understand any of it being in Vietnamese but got the gist in the end and found it enjoyable and humorously quirky.Would definitely recommend."

The seats are pretty small, so if you are tall you may have an uncomfortable seating during the show.The introduction is in English but the rest of the show is in Vietnamese and takes around 45 minutes. For me it was a nice experience to see all kind of puppets dancing on the water combined with some traditional Vietnamese singing. Tip: When you buy a ticket at the cashier you often find there are only tickets left for the 21.15 show. So if you wish to watch the earlier shows it is wise to book in advance."

His words were more along the lines of \"where else can you see water puppets\" and I suppose, that is the best way to describe the show. It's a little bit cultural, all in Vietnamese, there are some clearly talented musicians and puppeteers, but it's really just a tourist show. But for $3.00, why not go and see it? What have you got to lose? There's a great cafe at the bottom of the theatre stairs for a coffee afterwards, and I must say there is great skills on behalf of the puppeteers. No, it's not the most interesting thing around, and if you're short on time, then skip it. But it is a bit of corny, tourist fun, and sometimes it's exactly what you need."

The women singers talked to each during the performance. While they may have been giving instructions to each other, it was rather distracting. Additionally, Individuals arriving late meant that entire rows of people had to stand up blocking the view of other patrons and once again distracting viewers from enjoying the performance. The information on the pamphlets provided to viewers would benefit from more in-depth information about each song and section of the entire show.

The show now is more touristy and caters to foreign tourists who seem to either love it or fall asleep in the theater. The puppets are themselves colorful and I have not seen a puppet show in past where they move in three dimensions. The stories themselves are simple ones about rural life. The dialogues are lost unless you understand vietnamese and the accompanying live orchestra while likely authentic gets a bit screechy once the novelty value is lost.The place seems to always run to full houses as I had trouble getting tickets the day of the show and ended up buying advance tickets for the next day."

It was a charming, unusual, and very clever performance that kept the whole audience amused. When a family with four young children sat behind us, I braced for fussy fidgety children. Instead, all I heard was laughter and applause.We soon figured out that the puppets were attached to the ends of bamboo poles under the water, but we are still puzzled over how the puppeteers got the dragons to spit water, the farmers to do the back stroke, the birds to preen for each other.If you have children, this show is an absolute must. If you don\u2019t have children, go anyway. It\u2019s a blast and an interesting window into the folk art of traditional Vietnam."

However it was an entertaining show and with a duration of 45 minutes was probably perfectly timed. I won't pretend to have understood every one of the stories told but I did understand some of them and found the stories about the fisherman and the Coconut collector to be funny and entertaining. Given the amount of movement above and below the water and the number of characters crossing paths on the watery stage at any given time, the puppeteers appear to be very skilled.The theater appears to hold about 350 people but with the tiered seating, even sitting in the second row from the back we had no difficulty seeing the performance. The acoustics are also excellent. However the seats are quite small and any normal sized or above man will find it a tight squeeze."

I enjoyed watching this traditional Vietnamese form of entertainment, originally performed by farmers to entertain themselves when the rice paddies flooded. The puppets were quite primitive and the movement on the water a skill to perform but nothing special to watch; for me it was more about being a part of a cultural experience enjoyed by the Vietnamese. The traditional musical instruments were interesting to watch, but as with other reviewers a lot of the singing was lost on me. I did find the small pamphlet next to the door as you went into the theater quite helpful for identifying the different performances, and was available in multiple languages. Finally, the theater itself and seating space is small - it was not built for westerners but worth putting up with for 30 mins or so. Tickets were 100,000 for 1st class (nearer the front) and 60,000 vnd (nearer the back) but I'm not sure where the split in the rows is made. We were sat on the back row and didn't feel it detracted from the performance at all."

We paid 100,000 dong, roughly $10USD, for the good seats. You have a choice between good and ok seats, 50,000d or 30,000d. We bought our tickets in the late morning the day of and they only had one show left for the day with only the good seats left. If you want your ideal price range and time, GO EARLY!It starts with the band playing 2 songs, which was fine, then the show started. There's 12 skits. Some range from one minute to a couple of minutes. A couple of skits were really cool with beautiful dances and a great stories, most were just ok (puppets splashing about with a vague story being told and a cheap laugh) and several were just plain boring. Twice puppets arms fell off during the performance.The seating is like movie theater stadium seating, so unless someone's tall in front of you, you'll probably get a good view of the show. The seats however have smaller space than airplane seats!! I'm only 5'7 and I was cramped. If you're over 6 foot tall, you'll be uncomfortable. The whole show is in Vietnamese, which makes it authentic, but if you don't speak it you'll be oblivious to the stories or what they're trying to explain.I was glad I went, it was a neat experience but on hindsight, if I missed the show, it'd be fine with that."

I can see why this was a popular entertainment back in olden days when there wasn't the tv or Internet. The one important tip I have is: Pick up a brochure before you enter the theatre. It lists each scene that is enacted by the water puppets so you don't get lost or bored because you don't understand what's going on. There is a story, and a meaningful story at that. Well worth the visit for us."

You step into a a proper theatre with the set in front of you and sure enough there is the water pool. An orchestra sits to the side of the water stage in traditional costume and starts the overture as such. You are then entertained for an hour or so by a variety of puppets portraying a rural story. Dialogue is all in Vietnamese which makes it more entertaining as you don't understand a word but enjoy the intonation of the actors.

The show is a series of vignettes, some more visually interesting than others, and some having more dialogue, so less enjoyable if you don't speak Vietnamese. If you have kids who would enjoy a puppet show though, this is probably a worthwhile visit. Side note - we went to a seafood dinner nearby at a street vendor after the show, and after being used to prices of $2-5 for sidewalk meals, were shocked by our $50 USD bill...not sure if it was because it was seafood, or because the area is so touristy, but make sure to ask the price of things *before* you order."

After entering the building (close to Hoan Kiem lake) you mount stairs to enter a usual theatre. After you have found your seat(s), you observe that the stage is a big pool filled with water. On the left of the \"stage\" is a section (dry of course) where a Vietnamese orchestra of about nine men and women is installed. Then the performance starts with music from the orchestra and the water puppets, operated with long sticks by artists, standing in the water behind the backdrop, will appear in the water pool. (See picture). There is also music from the orchestra and dialog between the artists and members of the orchestra, supporting the story represented by the puppet show. The curious thing is, that of course most of the public is tourist and don't understand a word of Vietnamese. So the jokes made in the water puppet show leave the public cold while the musicians obviously are enjoying the jokes. But, while we do not understand much of the story, the performance and ambiance of the Water Puppet Theatre is not to be missed."

The \"stories\" are virtually incomprehensible - a series of nightmarish vignettes loosely choreographed to Vietnamese screeching. Even the performers look embarrassed to be associated with this disaster... behind their lifeless eyes you can almost hear them weighing the pros and cons of drowning themselves just to end the agony a little bit earlier. I considered this as well. As for the other reviews that actually recommend this experience, I'm at a complete loss for an explanation. Unless you're some kind of water puppet masochist, you're better off crossing the street to mingle with the locals and watch the sunset over Hoan Kiem Lake. Or drowning yourself."

The Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre continues an ancient tradition that uses puppets to tell cultural tales of the lives of farmers and peasants who live along the water. The music was good, the stories were interesting, though like everything in Vietnam there is a strong pro-communist message built in. We went to the 9:20 show and I was a little disappointed. The music was great but the puppets were old, some broken, and most in need of some TLC and a paint job. What bohered me most is that this was supposed to be the International troupe who travelled the world performing in dozens of countries. What I saw was sloppy puppeteering, with puppets sometimes 3/4 submerged in water, moving out of time, or not moving when they were supposed to. It is possible it was just an off night but I suppose if you figure these guys put on six 45 minute shows a day, 7 days a week and we saw the last show of the night, I guess its to be expected.The Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre is worth a visit if you're in Hanoi and for $5 its worth it but I would think I would have been more entertained by a local water puppet show somewhere else in Vietnam."

If you are visiting the museum of ethnology, they perform a water puppet show there as well which is included in your ticket price and doesn't require you to stay through the entire hour show. Right now the prices are 100,000 VND for 1st class (the front rows) and 60,000 for 2nd class (everywhere else). There is an additional charge to use video recorders.

We went after seeing the reviews on trip advisor and walked out wondering whether other reviewers had seen a different show.The puppets moved awkwardly, when they were supposed to be beating drums they just looked like they were waving their arms in the air with drumsticks. They were not in sync, with some puppets moving a second too late each time and you could see the arm of the performer behind the curtain and the storylines were lame. We sat in the second row and could see people in the front row nodding off because it was so boring. Since the puppets are so simplistic and unsophisticated, they could have made better use of special effects and lighting but didn't. I think primary school students could have done a better job. After seeing the show, their claim that they had performed internationally was unbelievable. The only saving grace of the show was a lady playing a unique one stringed instrument with amazing sounds.

We arrived a few minutes late but were very fortunate to receive 2 seats in the centre of the front row. In hindsight the late arrival may have been good as we missed all the bus loads being dropped off and organised. I found the performance delightful and appreciate we were able to take photos.

It is a colorful show, the puppets are delightful and the puppeteers, skilled. The ideas represent simple village life where water puppets were traditionally performed in rice fields.

Attractive, colorful costumes. Well worth it. You need to purchase your tickets early. Our agent did for us. I think the hotel would also do it. Don\u2019t bother with the restaurant downstairs - food is pricey and nothing to write home about."

The only downside is that the seats are quite small and not much space for your legs, so if you are overweight or claustrophobic, this place is not for you... and don't come late, my wife and I thought it was a good idea to let people in before us, only to have our entire row have to stand up to let us go to our seats."

This is a must-see attraction when you come to Hanoi.The theatre is quite small and it is arguable whether it is worth paying for the higher priced ticket (100,000vnd) or the cheaper one (possibly 60,000?). We paid for the higher priced ticket and were halfway back and I reckon the view in the back row may have been just as good.Although there was a brief English and French introduction, as the show progressed there was no explanation of each of the scenes, so it was left purely to our own imagination to interpret what was being acted out. It was worthwhile seeing the show.Tip: Head to the theatre at least one day ahead to book and pay for your ticket as the show times sell out well ahead of time. (We noticed that some show times had sold out three days prior!)."

The show at the water puppet theatre was fairly enjoyable, and a unique form of entertainment, with colorful and humorous scenes acted out on the water by the wooden puppets. Unlike the puppeteers, who remained invisible until they came forward to get their applause from the audience, the musicians and singers in their traditional costumes could be seen all the time. The puppeteers are very skilled at maneuvering the underwater rods and strings attached to the heavy puppets, all the time standing in deep water behind the scenes, and must be admired for putting on a show like that for nearly an hour.The dialogue and singing is not in English, but it is fairly easy to follow the simple story-lines with the help of the printed hand-out. Children would probably enjoy the show, which includes a fire breathing dragon and some amusing chase scenes.On the evening that I went the audience was mainly tour groups, with a few Vietnamese, and was completely sold out. Apparently this is a popular theatre, so it is best to get tickets in advance.It is an inexpensive introduction to a very traditional aspect of Vietnamese culture. However, if you are over 6\u2019 tall you will find the seating very uncomfortable as there is so little room between the rows and we were packed in like sardines. Also, the traditional music might not appeal to all Western ears if you have never been exposed to it."

For those that paid to photograph or video, there was no control mechanism vs those who did not. This left the \"honest\" payers as feeling ripped off as this appeared to be nothing more than another money making scheme. 2) The seating venue is cramped and wreaked of smoke smell. This detracted from the ambiance and connection with the unique art form. 3) People file in late and again this was not well controlled. As the aisle in front of your seat and the next seat are very tight, everyone must get up to accommodate late comers."

Support this traditional art and have a night with a difference. Book early as each performance is very popular and go to this one in Hanoi rather than the one in Ho CHi Minh."

The theatre is located near the central lake and is a colourful and cultural respite in otherwise a drab, noisy city."

On the other hand:If you have the time to relax at the cafe downstairs and then go up expecting to see something extremely strange full of colours, dancing and a good first step into this different culture and actually enjoy the professionalism of all being part of it then you can have a very nice hour.

There is a \"programme\" which is free, and tells you a little about each act.

The audio system is very clear and the music so mesmerising. That itself is worth the price of admission.Next up would be the puppet show itself. While being in Vietnamese the complimentary guide (which comes in multiple languages) does brief us what the overall play is about (broken down by chapter).

A great performance, suitable for everyone, even people who don't normally go to theatres, as the 17 pieces are really short (it lasts less than an hour all together), and very interesting, and the puppeteers exhibit great skill. The art of water puppets has developed in the delta regions of north Vietnam during the annual floods, as the fields were flooded and the farmers had time to indulge into art!"

Since there were no cheap seats left, I found myself behind a mother with a child on her lap, and I rarely saw a puppet. Fortunately for my adult daughter, there was no one sitting in front of her, so she loved the performance. Since Vietnamese entertainment is so different from American entertainment, I think it's a good thing to visit these kinds of events, so that you can get a feel for the culture of the country. The music and the puppets are traditional. This is probably a must see for someone visiting Hanoi, and if you buy your tickets a couple of days before, you should be able to get the better, cheaper seats. Be there on time, as those who came late had a hard time navigating in the dark."

The lights went down and the woman to my left and the man to my right pulled out their cameras and proceeded to accompany the beat of the music with their camera flash, only to be joined by a course of the other audience members and their flashes. I finally closed my eyes and enjoyed the music. Oh by the way, the music is wonderful and well worth all of the small entrance fee. For more information Google Ha Noi Water Puppet show. With all that said, it is traditional art form that tells folk tales of daily life in the rice fields. Do see it, you will enjoy it."

As well as marvelling at the displays, it is also an opportunity to sample traditional Vietnamese music played on traditional instruments."

The cheap seats are 60,000 VHD, the good seats 100,000, get there earlier in the day to purchase your seat as they sell from the front back, and don't cheap out, it's only a $2 difference. on the downside, the water smells a bit musty and the seats are a bit tight, but you quickly forget as the show begins. The Dan Bao solo is beautiful and the movement of the animal puppets is surprisingly realistic.Make it a night by taking in this show and then heading out for dinner at one of the Old Quarter restos."

It was just after Tet so may have been lucky as it was quieter but the theatre was 80% full. Let's just be clear what you can expect....as a few rather impatient or misinformed people left 15 mins into a 50 min show (perhaps running late for their next itinerary stop!). This is not Disneyland Hanoi with lots of modern gadgetry but a wonderful piece of traditional theatre that has been passed down from generation to generation and has a performing apprenticeship of 3 years. There is a combination of singing,music and obviously the water puppetry that kept our 3 and 18 mth old entertained with the youngest asking for \"Moooorrrre\" by the end. Whilst there was a brief introduction in English,French and ongoing dialogue and story telling was in Vietnamese but given this attraction is all visual then you don't feel you are missing out. Yes, the theatre is less than modern and the seats are more tight economy class than business class but for 45 mins of traditional entertainment that has a charming uniqueness and a peek back into a form of entertainment that has played out for hundreds of years in Vietnam then this is worth making the effort before you roll into the evening in the Old Quarter ,playing chicken with the motorbikes, restaurant bound for some local delicacies."

The ticket window takes credit cards as well as dong and dollars. You get an allocated seat (we were in the second row from the front and the view was excellent). There are NO subtitles but this is an ancient and very obvious art form, it's very easy to work out what's going on in all the little stories, it's very visual humor.All in all, this is an inexpensive, different and entertaining show that I would recommend to anyone - especially with children!"

Perhaps I was still experiencing jet lag or was just exhausted from a long day of touring, but I fell asleep during this show and we ended up walking out early. The music was extremely loud and, while there was definitely a story being told with the puppets, I didn't understand it since it was in Vietnamese. The puppets are very cool and there is no question that the people controlling the puppets backstage are really talented. I think I would have enjoyed an English-version of the show. I've never seen anything quite like this as the combination of puppets in water (yes, some even swim) is quite unique. If you have extra time on your hands and manage your expectations, it may be worth it, otherwise, skip it."

We were told we need to pay a one dollar to take video or photos, but this did not seem regulated and no one checked the ticket we bought to verify we could. The music that played before and during the performance, used some traditional instruments. This was excellent and very entertaining in itself. The scenes were not too long and it kept moving along. Since it is in vietnamese it was nice to have it keep moving to keep the kids attention. This is not an expensive outing and a part of the Vietnamese culture. It was a highlight of our trip to Hanoi. Book your tickets in advance for the show that you want, it sells out daily."

The show is opened 30mins before the show begins and it is recommended that you purchase a ticket earlier that day or previous day. The theatre is opposite to Hoan Kiem Lake (a main attraction in Hanoi). The tickets are 60,000VND ($US3) for 2nd class tickets or 100,000VND ($US5) for 1st class tickets. The difference being front row tickets. When you purchase your tickets, they are numbered ie: L1 (row L, number 1), so there is no need to arrive too early, however they do close the doors on time, so don't be late. There is a poster stating that you need to buy a ticket for photos/video $4 extra, nobody purchases these, and there is no policing of this. The show is in Vietnamese, so it is difficult to understand what is going on, you do receive a very basic brochure with little explanation. However I do recommend that you attend this show, it is an enjoyable 1hr, cheap entertainment. This show is also available in Saigon."

The tradition of water puppetry comes from the rice fields when they were flooded. The Vietnamese started it for fun and now continues as part of their culture.The performance is 50minutes long. There are 5 times for the show, at 15:30 PM - 17:00 PM - 18:30 PM - 20:00 PM - 21:15 PM. We purchased our tickets on the day- we bought them directly from the theatre at about 10.30am, for the show at 3.30pm. You can choose between first class tickets $5, or second class tickets $3. We paid for first class and got the second row. You will be allocated a seat number. So there is no need to get to the show really early and line up. The performance is worth the price. There is a musical accompaniment to the puppetry. I agree with other reviewers that they do appear bored, and yes I did see some of the ladies filing their nails. I did not look to much at the musicians themselves as we had seen a couple of traditional music shows before, (in Hoi An and Hue). The best part was the puppet shows. The performances were very fun. The music and the puppets moved well together to tell traditional stories. Some were quite funny and the audience had many laughs. Others were more serene and beautiful. The water is murky and the puppets at not really smooth in movement, but nonetheless if you watch it for what it is and listen to the music rather than focusing on how the puppets move, you will enjoy it. The show went quite quickly, although 50minutes was enough. Although there is no direct translation into English, or other languages. You can pick up a show program when walking into the theatre (free) and it gives a brief, very brief explanation of each item. The programs are in many languages, Japanese, French, German etc."

This short performance is well worth the price of admission, if only to see the most intensely bored set of performers I've ever seen on stage. That they nevertheless produce some highly enjoyable music is a tribute to their talent. I can't imagine what it must be like to perform the exact same show 5 or 6 times a day, 7 days a week, ad infinitum. But the two lead female singers looked like if you handed them nail files they'd spend the entire show using them. Although they're not capable of super-sophisticated movement, the puppet-cast-of-thousands is also pretty fun. But to me the best part is the music.A few practical points: the performance is miked, and therefore overwhelmingly loud in the small hall. (An advantage is that it's suitable for small children, who can talk out loud without much danger of disturbing anyone around them.) The seats provide very little leg room for persons of height -- I don't think I could've managed much more than the 45 minutes of entrapment the show required. Oh, and tickets do sell out for the popular 20.00/8 pm showing so plan to get them in advance."

The only negatives are that tourists insist on photographing with flash during the performance, and that the excellent live musicians providing the traditional music for the show appeared to be deeply bored. I can overlook that, but the flashes of cameras do interfere with one's ability to enjoy the performances. I highly recommend taking in a show and then visiting the sales desk for informative books about the tradition."

            "review": "Critical Review - just my 2 cents. The Water Puppet Theater is located near the lake (north-east) in a building which is not very hard to miss judging from the number of people queuing up for tickets daily.There are 6 show slots every day (only 5 on Sundays), and it runs 7-days a week. Tickets are priced at 100,000VND and 60,000VND. Plus 20,000VND (can be paid upon entering the show) if you want to use your camera. I was planning to see the renowned Water Puppet show in Hanoi as I read quite a number of great reviews about it. My friend and I had to stand in line for more than 15 minutes before we got our evening tickets (8pm show). However, the lady told us the 60,000VND tickets were sold out and gave us the 100,000VND ones instead. We got second row seats nevertheless.The show was pretty packed that night, though I saw quite a number of empty seats behind. I am not sure where they draw the line between the 100K and 60K seats though.Generally, it was an entertaining performance. Good musicians, great traditional music, it was definitely an experience not to be missed.On the contrary, being a performing artist myself, I tend to review performances in detail.Presentation/appearance wise - I don't understand the poor maintenance of puppets and props. Seeing they do 6 shows every day of the week, charging tourists approximately $3 and $5 and selling off most of their tickets, they should be able to keep the puppets and props in good shape. Some of the puppets are not even functioning well (eg. one arm moves, the other does not. some even have 2 faulty arms), where else they are a few that look so badly worn out (big obvious chunk of paint \"peeled off\" from face, and very dirty-looking dragon). A small part of the painted-Styrofoam even came off halfway through the show (well, because one of the puppeteers keep maneuvering the puppet against it).Performance-wise: As this has been an ongoing performance for many years, I never expected so many glitches from the start till the end. There were a few occasions where one or two of the puppets were not synchronized with the others during a dance. Not sure if the audience noticed that, but it was pretty obvious for us (my friends and I) seated in front. Some parts of the show were pretty sloppy too, making it seem like a chore for the performers - I know they have been doing the same thing too many times, but it really shows in their performance. I did forewarn a critical review, and am not some whiny tourist. Maybe Thang Long Water Puppet Theater can look into the 2 aspects, especially the appearance of the puppets.As said, it is a great performance overall. Get your tickets early to avoid disappointment as some show slots get 'sold out' really fast."

Unfortunately the show lasts an hour -- and even the kids were yawning. It's a puppet show, after all -- and the only novelty is that the puppets are in a tank of water, being manipulated from behind via poles, instead of from above or below in the usual fashion.

For all you hear about the show ahead of time you come in with pretty big expectations. Unfortunately the show failed to live up to those expectations for us.The show takes place in the cozy Thang Long auditorium in Hanoi. The main stage area features the pool where the the puppets perform, and off to the left is an area for a small \"orchestra\" and some vocalists. The show opens with a couple of musical numbers, followed by 11 short puppet acts (which are described in the program). I should note that the show did start on time when we visited.The musicians were perfectly good and demonstrated some specialty instruments that you won't see in the West. However, the puppetry left us feeling disappointed. I went into the show imagining complex puppetry actions, but most of the 11 acts were a particular set of puppets doing little more than bobbing left and right across the pool to the music. It frankly struck me as something a group of middle school kids might put on. Mercifully, the show is surprisingly short, otherwise I would have been asleep when the lights came back on.For whatever reason this has become an obligatory stop for visitors to Hanoi, so I doubt I will sway you not to visit. If you're on the fence about going, don't bother. If you missed the show, you really didn't miss much."

I have never seen anything like this before and I enjoyed the uniqueness and enthusiasm of the performers.- The singers were great and the instruments they played were fantastic to listen to.- I guess it's somewhat 'authentic' for vietnam but you will have a tough time trying to find anyone who is Vietnamese in the audience.CONS- The show is in vietnamese so it's hard to understand what is going on. However, this is manageable considering you just enjoy the puppetry.- They need to ban camera flashes in the theatre. Because the entire theatre is filled with Westerners all sporting big canon cameras they often don't know how to use the first 5 minutes of the show is nothing more than flashes. It's annoying. If you have a camera you should definitely take pictures but turn your flash off for heavens sake. It's not hard!CONCLUSIONDefinitely worth a visit. This was the most enjoyable thing we did in the city of Hanoi.CONCLUSION"

Only lasted about 45 - 50 minutes, so not too much of a struggle. Lots of short segments, so no one part drags on for too long. The small live orchestra is good and you have to admire the skill of the puppeteers. Seats are a bit on the small side and visibility will be impaired by people taking photos. The gradient of the seating could do with being a bit steeper to minimise the impact of being stuck behind a tall person."

We booked our tickets through Art Hotel Hanoi and got a 3.30pm show, front row tickets.Many reviews mentioned that it was a boring show but since I am of an South-East Asian background, I could relate to the stories being told. Of course the stories could have been better. The show is 45 minutes long and the theater is quite dark. Try not to use flash photography as it really is disturbing to the performers and audience. It starts off with festival drumming where if you look at the troupe, you would see some interesting instruments being played. The puppet show includes a chapter on horse racing, buffalo fighting, village guardian procession. All these are played out by puppeteers behind curtains manipulating the poles their puppets are on, in waist high water. If you find stories on village life boring, you may either skip this show or sit through it with an open mind.There was a scene listed in the playbill about Quan Ho singing and a few people around us remarked they don't know why the singer was caterwauling. Actually it is no different from listening to Chinese opera. The story in this segment are songs sung between men and women during a yearly festival. The puppets show a 2 processions, one with a male sitting in a palanquin and the other female. It reflects a period in history where men and women were segregated and it is not sightly to see a male being alone with a woman without chaperons. So during the festival, the male may sing a song to his heart's choice without being reprimanded. At the end of the song, both male and female return to their own palanquins and go on their way. Try get any show before 5pm because it will leave you with time to go to the lake and after the show take an early ice-cream snack at Fanny's. Tickets are at VND100,000. Pre-book your tickets through your hotel to avoid disappointment. It is a show that you would watch only once for the experience and value the dedicated performers."

We were (and still are!) trying to puzzle out how the puppets didn't get cross-tangled in each other. The musical group accompanying the puppet show should also be commended for adding to the atmospheric performance."

I was a bit reluctant to see the water puppets despite it being one of the headline tourist attractions in Haoi - I am just not really a performing arts kind of guy. But I went after chatting with various other fellow travellers, and I am quite glad that I did.It is a little difficult to explain exactly what the show is. It is a blend of performing arts, comedy, history and music. It all comes together pretty well for an enjoyable 45 minutes or so. I suspect a longer show might well have felt like a drag, but they pitched it about right in terms of length.The main attraction is the water puppets themselves. As it sounds, these are puppets that are manipulated from rods below the water rather than strings from above. It is very cleverly done, and almost \"acrobatic\" if that makes sense. I didn't see many children in the theatre but I am sure kids would have been delighted. The music is suprisingly haunting, even if you don't like traditional Asian music.It is expensive by Vietnamese standards (100,000 Dong, or US$5.00), but still less than a cinema ticket in the West. Announcements are in English, French and Vietnamese, but the performance itself is only in Vietnamese. But, like the opera, even if you don't understand the words, it is pretty easy to follow what is going on - these are not sophisticated plotlines!Couple of tips: get your tickets early (or possibly even day before), as they do sell out quite fast. Also, most people prefer the evening showing, but I think it works better in the afternoon - makes a nice break in the cool of the theatre from the heat of Hanoi."

Not very loing, about an hour and al the seats are good enough and it only costs 60 VND. I paid as much for my coffee at the cafe next door. Easy to find right on the Lake."

It was only 45 minutes long so I didn't get bored and was a cute way to spend an evening watching the puppets and listening to the music.

I was interested to see how the puppets worked but that was about it. Found in very unprofessional that the two of the puppeteers while taking their bow were talking to each other - seriously? You're on stage for 2 min, can't you table your conversation? We would not go back and would not recommend seeing this. Had we not been seated in the middle of the row we probably would have walked out. Also, because you are allowed to take pictures for an additional fee most of the performance felt like a strobe light with all the people taking flash pictures the entire time."

Apparently all their shows run housefull on all days.There's a live band playing music and singing (a couple of really good voices) and a group of people behind the curtain who manipulate the puppets using long rods under water. It's fun at the start marvelling at the art form, but gets repetitive after a while. The songs are all in Vietnamese, so you can't really follow what's going on. The theatre itself, although clean and air conditioned, is very cramped. There's absolutely no leg room when seated. So much so that if anybody's trying to get past you, you have to stand up and fold back the seat."

We have spent over 4 weeks in vn over the last 1 yr and visited many museums, attractions and this is the first time my children have lost interest so quickly. There are more interesting things in Hanoi to see."

I only can based on the puppet show to understand that this shows actually showing Vietnamese life as farmer, praying for rain then dragon brings rain, some dance for ceremony, couple meeting from boat. Its hard job to control the puppet using stick from behind the scene. This shows attracts people who like traditional show. Since this show inheritance for long time ago.

They have rice planting, coconut picking, horse races, dragons and fireworks. I mean that is some pretty serious puppetry.

This is the second time to have visited the Water Puppet Theater in Hanoi and it did seem better than 5 years ago, although I don't know why! Its very cheap for the afternoon shows that are 40,000 dong. But the price rises quickly and the evening shows are 100,000dong (US$5) per ticket. This is probably a bit expensive for this activity. The show is interesting, the chairs are too tightly packed, quite uncomfortable if you are taller than 6.0 (ft) but the show is just 45 minutes so you are able to get in/get out quite quickly. If you've some time in Hanoi, there isn't much else to do other than take your pick of restaurants and wait for your next trip to Halong Bay, Sapa or elsewhere so why not give this a try. I doubt we will go see it for a third time but I would recommend to first time viewers just because its cheap and gives you something to so/see around the old quarter."

After some debate, we decided to go ahead and see the historical show for ourselves. We knew it was unlikely to buy a ticket for a same day show, but got very lucky and had great seats. The music alone is worth the trip and the $3 ticket. I have never seen some of the musical instruments played at the show, and the musicians were incredibly talented. The old theatre and small seats added charm to the evening. Although the puppetry wasn't flawless, it was a great experience to see the water puppets in action. I laughed the entire show and thought it was perfectly silly and entertaining.In response to some of the negative reviews: the show is in Vietnam and should be in Vietnamese. I was unable to follow the plot, and it didn't take away from my experience in the least. The water was murky, but again, this is a small detail and did not distract me in the slightest.

            "review": "Absolutely pathetically bad. I rarely ever make such a black and white statement about anything on Trip Advisor, but take my word for it, the whole Thanh Long Water Puppet Theater experience - in the big main old \"theater\" next to Hoan Kiem lake - is a joke. It reminded me of the movie \"Team America: World Police\", which was at least intending to be sarcastic and funny.The theater itself is falling apart. The entrance is a mixture of falling apart and mid-fix-up: anywhere else if the West and parts of Asia would have it covered up, or closed for renovation for safety reasons. Not here: it's a naked collapsing mess for the naked eye. The building itself it falling apart. Our tour guide in Hue told us that the Vietnamese often intentionally let things fall into disrepair until a world organization like UNESCO or a UN office or a foreign charity agrees to pay for fix-up: this must be one of those cases.The ticket seller - apparently the same one as a previous December 2010 poster had - is rude and useless, rarely looking up from her cell phone and tickets. No easily understood information is signed for availability: yes there are signs with times, but even the day before, most of that day's and the next days's tickets are sold out - in our case, there was a hand-written sign that said only \"9:30\" on it, which apparently meant only 9:30AM show tickets for the next day were still available. Because of the ticket seller's attitude and no other apparent desk or office in sight, it didn't seem like much use trying to find out more either.Tickets are cheap: $3 up front and $2 mid to back. Front is fine, but the seats are uncomfortable for people over 5 and half feet or so, they are made for the generally smaller Vietnamese frame I suppose. Still, for an hour or so you can make it.There are signs saying you can pay to take pictures in advance or after, but it seems to run on trust, and most tourists seemed to abuse that totally, with no one enforcing it. Despite the laughably poor quality of the show, they still ought to disallow cameras: it's a darkened room for much of the show, and whatever mood there is is totally ruined by constant flashes and camera sounds throughout. The show itself is the anti-Cirque-du-Soleil. There's a water pit in the front at seat level, with a background ancient VN-looking \"building\" behind it with faux grass curtains on the bottom floor hiding the puppeteers. To the left are the musicians and two singers. The show is about an hour. The announcer speaks in English with a heavy, easily misunderstood accent. The musicians are all right, and the two VN female singers were perhaps the only good thing about the show.The show is intended to be about life and culture in VN over the past couple hundred years. The puppets themselves are papier-mache or whatever, about a foot tall each, attached under the water by what looks like poles that you can't see, and the puppeteers move the puppets around seemingly over the water and between each other and back and forth over the water. Getting all the crossing poles right must take a lot of skill; however, that skill is not in sight at this theater (well, at least we didn't see poles getting banged up on each other).The puppets are well worn and well dated - at some point this has gone beyond nostalgia and antique into just junkiness. The puppeteers can't seem to get their puppets to move around and dance in sync. Some puppets have little wicks and fire effects (with little candles on them) but the puppeteers repeatedly unintentionally got them doused in the water by puppetting without care. The entire stage looks like it's falling apart, sometimes the lit puppets would bang up against the faux grass curtains as the puppets went back into the back and it looked like the fire would set the curtains ablaze (thankfully this did not happen). The water itself is so full of floating garbage that it's sometimes distracting and wholly unsavory looking.I can not overstate how bad this is. That is not to say the concept or location aren't fantastic: they need a LOT of work. The building needs fixing. The ticket attendant needs to be replaced. The staff overall needs training. The stage itself needs an overhaul, the sound system for the narrator needs replacing, the puppets themselves need replacing, and the puppeteers need more training.I would seriously suggest that the management contact Cirque du Soleil - quietly, privately - and spend some money to get them to consult on how to overhaul this thing. Until then, absolutely do not bother unless you like to see a trainwreck of a \"performance\"."

Secondly, I first knew about this water puppet show as NatGeo had an episode that covered it.The building was under going renovations on the first floor when I went, so I was instantly surprised when we got up to the second floor and led into the cosy theatre. The music accompanied the water puppet show perfectly and it just amazes me how the people controlling the water puppets behind the curtains can withstand the heavy weight of some puppets. There was some scenes where by the curtains was pulled aside to introduce new puppets and the audience could make out people using their hands to push the puppets forward. It was a slight turn off but it was inevitable I guess. Major annoyance was when inconsiderate tourists snap pictures with their flash on.I really appreciate the part whereby the show's ending and all of the cast members come out from backstage and gave a thank you bow to the audience. It was really sincere and you could assume that they are really determined into preserving this wonderful heritage, the Thang Long Water Puppet Theater."

Performances are simple and the accompanying orchestra is good insight into traditional Vietnamese music. The skits depict aspects of life and myths from the rice paddies. They are not a single storyPerformances are a little degraded by the flashing of camera from audience members who do not realise that the puppetry is too far away to be lit by their feeble flashes, or have no idea how to turn the flash off on their camera. I think this would have been wonderful to see before the advent of cameras in the rice paddiesThe introduction of fire to the shows has increased the entertainment value - however, be sure to note where your nearest fire exit is and have your escape plan ready ;)TIP: get your tickets the day before or you may miss out on the show that you want to see"

We went to the show on the back of a glowing recommendation from the Lonely Planet - I can only assume that the LP reviewer saw a different version. Although the music was particularly good, the overall impression was one of disorganisation and of lucklustre puppeteers. At some points the show was almost embarassing for the audience: the musicians talking and laughing when they were not performing and two puppeteers wading into the performance area to retrieve a puppet that had become caught on a fixed prop. It's hard not to come away with the impression that the producers know that they can wheel out the same mediocre performance night after night to an audience of tourists who will applause regardless.Having said the above, at $3 the show is worth a watch as it is a unique spectacle and is only an hour long. How it has such a good score from reviewers on this site is, however, a mystery to me."

I found it a nice escape from the bustle of Hanoi - and I especially liked the music which is live (the first two songs showcase the talents of the musicians - one of whom played a solo on a stringed instrument (I think it's called an Erhu) that for me was a highlight of the show. The cost is next to nothing (pay extra for the better seats - I think it's a buck more) and don't bother to do it as part of tour. We just showed up and got second row seats - well worth a late afternoon break from walking around Hoan Kiem Lake (shows are every 1.5 hours from around 3pm to 9pm)."

            "review": "water puppetry in Hanoi. We weren't sure quite what to expect but it was quite entertaining. Water pupperty originally started in the 11th century, performed on ponds and flooded rice paddies in the Red river delta in Northern Vietnam. The country folk believed (and many still do) that spirits controlled every aspect of their lives, from cooking to farming, so worshipped kitchen gods and rice gods etc, and invented water puppetry as a means of worshipping them. Nowadays the shows take place in a theatre, but the stage is still water. I spent the show trying to figure out where the strings were as I couldn't see them. It wasn't until the end when a bamboo screen was lifted to reveal the puppeteers standing waist deep in the pool that I realised the wooden marionettes are controlled using long bamboo rods from beneath rather than strings from above. An orchestra and singers play traditional music to accompany the several short stories acted out on the water. All the stories have a rural theme - fishing, farming, harvest, etc - based on Vietnamese folklore, and are in Vietnamese, so couldn't follow everything, but generally got the gist . Particularly enjoyed the one about the legend of the returned sword as we'd seen the tortoise that is supposedly the star of the story earlier on in the Ngoc Son temple."

In just 55 minutes we were introduced to the main features of Vietnamese agricultural life, the country's symbolic animals (dragon, turtle, phoenix and unicorn), and Hanoi's founding legend. The brightly-painted puppets were full of personality, there was some gentle humour, and the manipulation of the puppets on the water 'stage' was very skilful. The whole performance, including the accompaniment on traditional instruments, was delightful and not to be missed. Afterwards I bought an irresistibly cute turtle ($US7) as a souvenir.

            "review": "A Nice Cultural Experience, but not for Everybody. This type of water puppetry dates back to the 11th century, about 1,000 years ago. It started as a way to rid rice plantations of evil spirits, and soon grew into entertainment for ancient villages, and is unique to Northern Vietnam (though it's now shown in Saigon as well). Now, watching puppet shows of any kind may sound really boring for you - and if that is what you are suspecting, then you are probably right. And yes, this is actually a puppet show, with all the dialogue in Vietnamese (no English translation). So, before spending an hour of your time on this, think to yourself if watching a puppet show where you don't even understand what people are saying can still be worth it for you, even at a cost of just $4.00, given that you'll be exposed to beautiful live traditional Vietnamese music, and expertly done puppetry, as well as a little cultural exposure to ancient Vietnam. If the answer is \"that sounds really stupid\" then this show is definitely not for you and you will have a much nicer time elsewhere in Hanoi.For me, it was a treat. Granted, I sat as a full grown adult watching a puppet show for an hour, but the traditional Vietnamese music was what did it for me. It is performed live, beautifully done, very nice to sit and listen to, and the puppetry is done to the beat of the music. The skills of the puppeteers were excellent, it was well choreographed, and the orchestra was in traditional costume. The water puppets themselves were interesting to see, as they are typical Vietnamese, and I've never seen anything quite like them before - handmade and colorful. It only lasts an hour, costs only $4.00 (well worth the extra $2.00 to upgrade to the VIP seats for a total of $6.00), and is a nice break in a day of sightseeing and hot sunshine.The downsides of the experience are that the seats are miniature, so at 6'2\", I had to sit sideways down the aisle, and after the show started, I immediately moved to an aisle seat so I could remotely exist in the seats. There was no way I could extend my legs. There is one seat in the very back that is at the end of the aisle, so you have nobody in front of you - this was a godsend, as we booked too late and the front row seats were already sold out (the whole show was sold out actually). The narration and dialogue are entirely in Vietnamese, so you don't know what they're saying - you can follow the acts, because they're pretty basic, but it would be nice if they put a subtitle board up or something so everyone could enjoy the story, which might have been a nice one, I'll never know. Cameras are allowed, but they ask you to pay a dollar or so if you want to take photos, or $5.00 if you want to take videos. They're working on the honor system, though, trusting you to be honest about your intentions, so it's not enforced, it's just up to you to decide how you want to handle it. Basically, I was able to appreciate this for the cultural experience that it was, and also as a nice break in the day where I could listen to some new traditional music - some other people were sleeping, but at the end of the show some even gave a standing ovation, and nobody walked out early. Now, if I just focused on the puppet show in Vietnamese as pure entertainment, I would probably have been sleeping too. Definitely not for everyone, but I'm happy I took an hour out to see it, and it's right by the lake, so you can walk from there out and about or take a cyclo ride."

The program was presented as a series of short vignettes and although all in Vietnamese, they were easily understandable. Each was so short that it was impossible to get bored and the whole thing represented great value for money. You could only wonder at the skills of the puppeteers and when they all present themselves at the end, it was fun to see them in their wet weather gear. Go see it!"

This is a traditional show - you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand the story and if you are visiting a foreign country don't be so arrogant to expect 'subtitles or translation' Just enjoy it for what it is and maybe read a bit about it before you go. Lasts just over an hour, sure not everyone will like it, I'm pretty cynical generally and I found it quite charming. Kids will love it."

            "review": "A Nice traditional show. Thang Long water puppet is a show that becomes a tradition for thousand years in North Vietnam. Because the show performed on the surface of ponds and rice-fields thousand years ago, it is also performed on the same way in the theatre nowadays.The stage contains a small ponds with greenery water and bamboo curtains at the back to hide the figure of the player.Tickets are sold in 2 classes:1. First class, costs VND 60,000 (1 USD = VND 17,500)2. Second class, costs VND 40,000Performances take place all days of the week.Time15:30 PM - 17:00 PM - 18:30 PM - 20:00 PM - 21:15 PMSunday morning: 9:30 AM ( especially discount 50% ticket price for youngsters)In the brochure it is stated that you have to pay VND 15,000 for taking pictures with camera and VND 60,000 for capturing a movie/video. Inside the theatre, everybody ignore this note and just take pictures and movies freely.As I told you, you must be a tradition and culture lover if you want to see this show. Otherwise, it will be very boring for you and you will feel like wasting your precious and limited time in Hanoi/Vietnam.For little ones, I am pretty sure that they will love the show because it is interesting to see the puppets appear and dissapear from the water, dancing and perform on the surface of the water, and so on.The whole show takes about 45 minutes, covering 17 scenes, not related to each other:1. Raising the Festival Flag2. Chu Teu or the narrator3. Dragon Dance: Four Dragons dancing on the surface of water4. On a buffalo with a flute5. Agriculture (planting the rice field)6. Catching frogs7. Rearing ducks and catching a fox8. Fishing9. Harvest festival. Returning to the native land after college graduation. A triumphant return of a new graduate to his native village aim at expressing his gratitude to the anchestors.10.Lion dance11. Phoenix dance (ended with having a big white egg, interesting)12. Legend of the Restored Sword; King Le Loi after triumphing over Ming invaders, gave the magic sword back to a giant golden turtle who lived in the Lake. This legend is associated with Hoan Kiem Lake or Lake of the Restored Sword which is located in front of the Thang Long Theatre.13. Children playing in the water14. Boat racing15. Unicorns play with a ball16. Fairy dance17. Dance of four holy animalsTips from me:A. Buy the front row seats (A, B, C, D). At the back seats you will see nothing except people's heads in front of you.B. Be at the place at least half an hour to make your chance bigger in getting the front row seats. The best is to book it online or through someone you know in Hanoi previously like I did.C. Don't try to relate one scene to another because it does not have any relationship at all.Last but not least: enjoy the show!"

            "review": "A fun and illuminating cultural experience!. The water puppet show takes place in a small theater -- both first and second class tickets will buy you good seats. Be sure to purchase your tickets a few days in advance, as shows are often sold out due to bulk purchases by tour groups. The show is a quick 45 minutes or so, and it is a really fun experience. Musicians play traditional Vietnamese instruments and the puppeteers hide under a stage and behind some curtains as they maneuver the colorful wooden puppets to the music, portraying various aspects of traditional rural life. Yes, the show is in Vietnamese, but that's part of the cultural experience! As you enter the theater, you can pick up a free pamphlet in English, which briefly describes the art form and the series of \"dances\" you'll encounter. That is more than enough to give you the context you need to understand the show -- the rest is up to you, your imagination, and your sense of cultural appreciation! It was well worth the price ($3-4) and one of the most enjoyable parts of our trip to Hanoi!P.S. Some of the scenes can be a bit scary for young children due to loud drums and flashing lights. Suitable for preschool aged and up!"

It is in an enclosed air-conditioned (although it may may not be that cool tempreture wise) theater just opposite the Hoan Kiem lake.The three of us loved it. I had reservations about watching it initially because I am not a cultural performance buff. However, we are glad we did go. Yes, it was all in Vietnamese but then again, how can it be authentic if it was done in a foreign language? At 60,000 Dong (roughly USD3.60), you simply cannot miss it - and it is not about the money either.You are given a pamphlet with a title or a one line description of each of the 17 scenes lasting about an hour. Knowing what each scene is about, we found it fairly easy to understand what the puppeteers are trying to convey - which is basically of local beliefs and of everyday life. Figuring it out was half the fun. Think of how the puppeteers do it and you'd be more appreciative.Yes, there were some people in the audience who were sleeping (I would like to think that it was because of their hectic tour itinery more than anything else) but most were interested and attentive. Go see it and remember that this type of entertainment has long history as well - well before most entertainment must sees as we know today."

However, the actual puppet show is all in Vietnamese. The only translation you can count on is the Program Sheet which you can take outside the entrance of the theatre. This pamphlet comes in both English and French,but don't count on it too much, for it only states the title of the chapters and nothing else. I do not understand Vietnamese, and so could only admire the skillfull maneuvers of the puppeteers behind the curtains. Unfortunately, you will not be able to comprehen the story the puppets are trying to tell. I would say this place is not a must-go, but no harm visiting if you have some time off. Tickets are at 40,000 dong. Photography during the 50-min show is allowed at no charge although the tickets states otherwise."

If you are from any parts of Asia where puppet show is a norm, this Hanoi's version is short of surprises.The novelty of a water-based show wears out fast after 20 minutes. The melody, the tricks and lighting become too reptitive for an hour long show.Worst, there's no translations or subtitles to go with the singing which is a real pity.Still, you should visit this once if you are in Hanoi because there's nothing better to do besides eating and walking around the Old French Quarter.If you are one of those who believed every show has a 'spirit' behind, this one may be it. It was originally staged to worship 'deities' and provide entertainment during a flood so there you have it...the original sin...hehe..."

After meeting the theatre director and requesting photographs for a Hanoi magazine article I am writing, I did not receive them. So I returned to the theatre, opened the door of the corridor leading to her office and took two steps. Through the open door of a smoke-filled conference room, I was greeted by a flurry of pointing and barked commands to leave. Then two men rose up from the table and physically escorted me to the door. In 20 years of journalism, writing for publications scattered around the globe, I have never received treatment like that from any individual or organisation. [My source list includes reformed terrorists and hardened criminals]. About the only theatre employee capable of civility and communication was the outside security guard who had a second language [French] and [shudder] interpersonal skills."

I caught the water puppet show on the last night of my trip, after I had gone on all the tours, after I had learned all about the Vietnamese legends and the culture. The show wraps up everything in one musical and cultural delight!This form of entertainment is found only in Vietnam, having originated from the farmers who would stage the shows in rice paddies or in shallow ponds. Set to traditinal Vietnamese music, courtesy of a live band and vocalists, the puppet show depicts Vietnamese legends, religious/cultural beliefs and their typical way of life. All scenes are depicted with the use of puppets that actually swim, dance, battle, climb trees, catch fish etc quite well!Buy your tickets early or ask the front desk of your hotel to secure tickets for you while you tour -- the seats sell like hotcakes and a lining up a few minutes late could cause you to line up the following afternoon. (really helps to ask the hotel's front desk to do it for you)Also, make sure you get yourself a copy of the program that has both a Vietnamese and English translation of the different scenes that are being depicted. The poor folks seated beside me without a program were quite lost.I'm really glad I caught this show and I really recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining and delightful way of capping off their visit to Hanoi."

Also, coming from an Asian background, I was certain that I would not be particularly intrigued by it. However, I surprised myself by staying for the entire hour. The puppets were amazingly agile and I couldn't help wondering about the immense skills needed to control the puppets. For the price (40,000 dong for front row seats), I would say it is quite worth the experience. What I hated about the experience: The cramped theatre and the limited leg space. Also, the constant flash from the photography of the tourist was distracting."

Still, we got to hear live singing and music played on traditional Vietnamese instruments, and watch highly skilled puppetry performed in a pool of water.. And some parts are just so humourous! Simply amazing.. We're glad we didn't miss it!Tips:- Ticket prices: 20,000 VND for Class 2 and 40,000 VND for Class 1 (USD1 = 16,000 VND). You can pay extra if you want a CD.

We were in the front row having paid less than a dollar extra, it's worth it. You also get a CD of the music, ideal for editing your video when you get home. Both still and video cameras are allowed and contrary to what our guide book told us, we didn't have to pay extra to film.The show itself began with some Vietnamese singing and music, interesting. And then the magic began. The movement of these huge and multi-parted puppets was incredible, at times you couldn't believe what you were seeing. Firecrackers add to the illusion. Room is warm but pick up a free fan on the way in.Only tip I'd give is to walk a couple of minutes when you get out before taking a taxi. We got one directly outside and were totally ripped-off, our only negative taxi experience in Vietnam."
