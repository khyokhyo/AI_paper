Angkor wat used to be a nice place to visit when one can take time to look at the bas reliefs and get a guide to talk about the history and architecture of this ancient infrastructure. But with flights now connecting to more places in the world, particularly China, the temple transform into a wailing market, with tourists screaming posing and simply bulldozing everywhere. I supposed this is the aftermath of globalization. But it can be a tormenting experience, and making this park totally overrated. A picture speaks a thousand words, so see attached. Sun rise at Angkor sounds fun - and it sounds fun to at least another 10-20 thousand others too."

Much like the Great Pyramids of Egypt, Angkor provides a look in to the ancient history of the region - and one cannot help but marvel at the engineering feats before them and contemplate the greater significance of the sites. The park, as a whole, offers a great number of temples to be seen - some of which are more physically challenging than others. A good book or a guide can help you determine which ones you want to visit - but don't leave without visiting Angkor Wat, specifically.Throughout the park, you'll find areas where gifts are sold - as well as bottled, water, etc. Be warned, though, that there are also children near the major entrances - and they will hound you to buy something from them - \"magnet for you - good price,\" -- \"two magnets, $1,\" -- \"sell tee shirt for you good price,\" -- \"you want book, only $1?\" This can honestly be a bit annoying - but just keep walking; you may be followed for a few hundred feet, but the moment you buy one thing - then the rest will think it's on and you'll buy from them, as well. There are plenty of places to buy Angkor gifts where you won't be hounded and the price will also be reasonable. This should not, however, impact your desire to visit - because the sites are absolutely worth it regardless."

Our guide tried to make it a bit more individual as well as avoiding the crowds and so we went is a different order and approached Angkor Wat in the early afternoon from the rear. This strategy was fairly successful except for Bayon which we visited before lunch. It was almost impossible to move and take photos without hoards in the shots but then it is Angkor and we were lucky to have it good for the rest of the day. It remains amazing,beautiful and all those other superlatives and I would return if the opportunity arose in the future."

I was also a little concerned about spending several days there for fear of being \"templed out\". I need never have worried. There area is magnificient. We spent three days there including a preliminary visit to the Angkor National Museum and in the end I could have spent longer. Main piece of advice is read a book or books before you go. You don't absolutely need to. It is incredible enough but it certainly will make your experience even better."

Currently $20 for a day pass and $40 for a three day pass and it's money well spent. The sites here are spectacular and like nothing else on Earth. If you've read up before you've arrived you can get by without a guide. Just organise a tuk tuk driver for your stay and tick off the sites one by one. You'll pay upwards of $20-$25 a day for a tuk tuk driver, especially if you're wanting to take in Banteay Srei. Angkor can get overrun with tour groups so make a plan to start early and press on over lunchtime. Most of the buses head back for lunch leaving some of the more popular sites less busy. An amazing few days can be had here with just a little planning."

            "review": "Tips for the visit... Well I can say a lot about how stunning this sight is and how it worths the money, but there are plenty of such reviews already...So here are some tips:1. Take a guide - If you are interested in more than yet another selfi/photo tour with the Bayon or with the wild trees in Ta Prom you must get a guide and preferably a good one. You should tell him what are your interests (architecture, history, methology..) so he can emphesize the relevant information.2. Visit the museum before - this is a really great way to get a nice background that will help you to really understand the religions and the history behind the carvings and temples (we only had 2 hours in the museum and we didnt go to all the rooms. If you are the kind of people that like to read every word- plan more than just 2 hours..).3. Take your time - If you really want to see the whole beauty of Ankgor, we suggest to take the 3 day tour.4. Sunrise timing - sunrise at Ankgor Watt can be stunning if the weather is good but otherwise its a bit dissapointing so check the weather before.5. Pack your own breakfest - most people that come to sunrise will go back to their hotel to eat breakfest. If you bring your food with you, you get a chance to walk around and it wount that crowded.6. Pack your own lunch - if you dont want to spend 20$ for average sized meal with drinks you can buy some groceries at the supermarkets in the city and make some sandwitches to keep you fed just until you are back in the city.7. Suggested itinerary - 1st day: Kbal Spean, Bantey Srei, Bantey Sumrae, Sunset at Pre Rup (prefer car over tuk tuk for this day because its a long drive). 2nd day: Sunrise at Ankgor Watt and tour, Ankgor Thom north gate, \"Grand Tour\" - Preah Khan, Neak Poan, Ta Som. 3rd day: Ankgor Thom with the Bayon, Baphoun and the terraces and last but not least - Ta Prom.I also want to recommend the following company for booking a guide and transportation - AnkgorTouchStone (Look for them in TA) , our guide was Mr. Manune which amazed us with his knowledge about the temples.Enjoy!!!"

            "review": "Visiting this place should be part of your bucket list!. Angkor Archaeological Park hosts the temples which include the Angkor Wat Temple, Bayon Temple, and majority of the interesting and Historical Temples in Siem Reap, all of which would offer you the most breathtaking and amazing views which you need to see at least once in your life. Before entering the temples, you would have to pay for a ticket which would be checked upon entry for every temple. The ticket costs around USD 20 for a day, and you could also purchase the the 40 USD and 60 USD tickets for three and seven days, respectively. It is recommended that you stay in Siem Reap for about three to four days to explore the temples however, since the major and most interesting temples are twenty to thirty minutes apart via Tuk-tuk. The temples are actually grouped into two - The Big Circle, and the Small Circle. The Big Circle is composed chiefly of all the surrounding temples within the park, which are quite interesting and quite far from each other, while the Small Circle is where you get to see Angkor Wat and all the other temples near it. There are also other temples which are not part of these two primary groups which you can also book as an add-on on your tour, like Banteay Srei and the Roulous group.Be warned of the lurking off-duty policeman who would offer to take your photo and ask for a tip of 1 USD, in some of the temples. They are quite friendly, but may also intimidate you. Nonetheless, a tour inside the Angkor Archaeological Park is one must-go places which you should really consider being part of your bucket list."

            "review": "A beautiful piece of art. There is something extraordinary about watching something that has been left as a legacy to us. I maybe an Indian, and this might have been another country, but art, architecture & history holds an appeal that can keep me occupied. From Angkor to Bayon and the Ta Prohm, every monument is different and yet attractive. Some of the pros: There is a huge number of foreign tourist crowding to Cambodia. Don't get disheartened seeing the crowd. Unlike the Indian tourist crowd, there's absolutely no hustle bustle and noise. To watch the sunrise at Angkor, you have to get up by 4 and reach the site by 4.30 max. The ticket counters has a huge line. But the processing is entirely different. He entry pass requires your physical presence. A photograph is taken and a quick ID is made. The pace is valid for all the sites within the park. There are three kinds of pass which you can opt for - 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week. It's difficult to get a spot in the Angkor during the sunrise. Hold your peace and wait it out. One way or the other, you will find a way to get the right place to get the right shot. Con -There are lot of monuments that have steep stairs and requires lot of stamina and physical effort. If you are travelling with family and have elderlies, then you might have to pay attention in how you plan the visit to these structures."

I've done individual reviews for the temples I have reviewed and leave this for a few general tips:1 - Angkor is a must see destination - go - you will be hot, sweaty and hotter and sweatier, but it is worth it, do pack a hat and an umbrella. Even if it is not raining the umbrella can help with persistent sun!2 - A day does not do justice to the surrounds. We found three days was perfect for us. I have a bit of an interest in history (including studying it as a minor at University) and this was enough for complex explanations about most of the sites.3 - the bathrooms are surprisingly good! Do carry tissues and hand sanitiser though just in case.4 - At almost every temple there are a lot of sellers, these women and children (mostly) are very persistent. Do not buy from the children who should be in school. They will nonetheless follow you around. Mr PH had one persistent young girl drop from $1 for a postcard to $1 for ten. We still did not buy.If you do buy from the women, come to a fair price and be aware they start low and won't take no for an answer! I'm still not quite sure how I ended up with three pairs of pants and a top for $12.00 when I was looking at one pair of pants! Also note the pants come in various sizes even though they will tell you they will fit, if you have a booty there is a good chance they will not! I'm a US 6/8 but with a butt and two of my three pairs were too small. Luckily I have slimmer friends! 5 - A guide is well worth the money for their knowledge of the less trodden paths, good angles for photography and the associated history of each site.6 - Temple fatigue is a thing, especially in the heat. I recommend writing the name of each temple down as you enter and photographing that name so you have a reference point when you go through your photos later.7 - there is lots of art for sale as you enter the temples. Your guide may be able to tell you what is actually drawn/painted locally in Cambodia and what is not. We purchased an approx. A4 piece in watercolour for USD $8 but the artist was there creating more as we watched. Note the large Angkor Wat silhouettes are mass produced and of poor quality. 8 - you can easily purchase water, scarves, hats and various tourist tat such as pants, tops and postcards at the temples. Our guide advised us the goods on sale were the same as Angkor Night Market so we did some shopping between temples and skipped the Night Market.9 - The temples are well policed by those who check your tickets, while I'd like to think those who can afford to travel to Cambodia would not think of trying to sneak in for free ,if not - I warn it would not be easy to!"

Mainly because of the sheer number of vast temple complexes on offer beyond just the famour Angkor Watt. We were unsure of the best itinerary, but based on what we did and what we wished we could do, I'd suggest the following.Spend 2.5 to 3 days - buy the 3 day pass for $40Day 1 - Grand circuit tour starting at Preah Khan and working your way round clockwise. There's definitely time to add on an extension to Banteay Sri and its well worth itDay 2 - Petit circuit. I'd suggest starting at Angkor Thom and working your way round clockwise. That way you'll definitely be way ahead of the large tours which tend to start at Angkor Wat. I'd suggest ending the day at Angkor Wat as the sun will be shining from the West and makes for much better photos of the main west entrance over the water etc. In the morning the sun is usually too bright and photos don't come out properlyDay 3 - Sunrise in Angkor Wat. We never got round to doing this, but wish we had! Then spend the rest of the day seeing things you might have missed or wanted to make a second visit to, or head further afield."

It was nice reading about Angkor in history classes but is far better to actually see the site itself. 1 day is not enough so i suggest to do a 2-day tour. Avoid the crowds or go against the usual itinerary so you can further appreciate the ruins in its majesty. We made the tour in 1 day just checking the \"must-see\", so doing it for 2 or more days will be less tiring and more wonderful in terms of relishing the sites. I hope to go back here again."

Originally Hindu later converted to Buddhism and visa versa. The daily pass costs 20 USD and offers unlimited access to every monument in the park. If you purchase a three day pass you get a discount. Th park is very well taken care off. You can take a tuk tuk (motorbike with passenger chariot) and enjoy the ride from temple to temple. Approximately 1km from monument to monument. Toilets are good but scarce. Use when available. Also restaurants are available inside the park."

Like most tourists we thought of just Angkor Wat and Ta Prohm (\"Tomb Raider\" Temple), but in reality Angkor Wat is a small piece of the picture. You need to plan for at least a couple of days to get a decent look at the area. Angkor Wat takes some time to visit and Angkor Thom is actually a larger area. This is where Bayon temple and the Terrace of the Elephants are, and you can ride elephants there too.Ta Prohm, Preah Khan, Panteay Kdei are all in the same area. We had a tuk-tuk with a guide and it took 5 - 10 minutes between each stop. Each of these is a must do for a study of the history of the temples. I suggest that you buy the 3 day pass for $40US - this allows you to visit on any 3 days within a week of purchasing the ticket. Buy from the Angkor ticket centre. If you're not going with a tour then try to take a waterproof bag / packet for your ticket as if it is damaged they may not honour it (many tours give you a lanyard with a plastic pouch).Overall a magnificent area to visit."

While you must seek Angkor Wat (the big one you must see at sunrise) and Bayon (the one with all of the faces), if you stop there, you will be missing out. Banteay Srei was built in the 800s and is carved out of pink sandstone. Because of the particular rock used, all of the carvings are in excellent condition. It's also close to the Landmine Museum (so see those two things together). Smaller temples like Chaosay Tevoda and Tahomm Anon were as beautiful as the bigger temples, but had zero tourists (other than my family). That meant my kids could quietly pretend to be Indian Jones without bothering anyone else. Ta Som was a favorite (do not miss the gates in the front and back) Preah Khan, and Pre Rup were also favorites. My kids are 11 and 13, so I never had to worry about them falling off of the temples, but I would be worried with a toddler. Kids under 12 are free! Yay! But they cannot climb to the top of Angkor Wat. Boo. I would also suggest a tour guide. You could do it on your own, but why? You might miss some of the best parts of the temples, or some great photo ops. If you have not been to the temples at Angkor, put it on your bucket list!"

It'll be a lot cooler, a lot more magical (especially with the earlier morning light), and a lot less crowded. We went to Ta Prohm at opening time (7:30 am) and there was hardly a soul there. One of the coolest aspects is the sound of the jungle and the sights of nature all around you as you view the remnants of a vast human empire. It's like a competition between man and nature to see who is more awesome, yet it comes out a fusion of the two. To have an even better experience, I recommended bringing a camera and booking a tour with Angkor Wat Photography Tours. Also, do at LEAST a three-day pass; 1 day is no where near enough to enjoy this marvelous place."

After visiting 14 temples over a 3-day period, my conclusion is simple: the 3-day pass (allowing 3 day visits over a one-week period) is the most realistic proposition for most visitors. A 1-day pass is definitely too little and a 7-day pass (over one month) will be out of the question and/or over the top for most people. But over 3 days we had time for less crowded places than the unavoidable Big 3 (Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Prom), and could afford repeat visits to favorite places (Ta Prom, for us), as the quality of light and time of day makes such a huge difference. Prah Khan, Ta Som and Srah Srang were places we had almost to ourselves, which makes for a different experience. (A very significant hike in the price of these passes is due to take effect in March 2017, with the 1-day jumping from USD20 to USD37 and the 3-day from USD40 to USD62)."

We bought the 3-day pass and went there on three half-day trips and still did not see every temple in the park. We visited the Angkor National Museum to soak in some historical information before the temple visits and explored the area on our own. Hiring a Tuk Tuk for the entire day will cost roughly $20-35 dollars depending on how far out of town you want to go. I personally think this is a better option than hiring an air-conditioned car even though it can get quite dusty on the road in Siem Reap. You just feel much closer to the surrounding environment being in a Tuk Tuk. There are a lot of walking on uneven terrain and under the scorching sun so make sure you watch your steps and stay hydrated. Overall one of the best trips I have ever taken anywhere.

            "review": "What else would one do in Cambodia...?. Come on, a TripAdvisor listing for one of the most visited temple complexes in the world seems slightly redundant; particularly when calling it a \"must see\" - well obviously. When one is in South East Asia, particularly Cambodia, it seems to me almost certain that a trip to the Angkor Wat complex is on the cards at some point. As a result, and to save time with reviewing all the multiple temples separately, I will simply write here a few observations from our recent trip, as well as some snippets of advice on which temples of the inner circuit to visit and when. Most people from Siem Reap will take tuk tuks; reasonable price for a day hire seems to be $10-15, though if you pick one up off the street rather than pre-booking they can try and charge anywhere between $20-50. If one feels a little more adventurous, however, there are alternative methods; we chose to hire bicycles at $2 each for the day. The roads are a lot less scary than they look, though poorly maintained, and the heat is enough so that any rain will quickly dry when it stops. Cycling was a lot more fun than tuk tuk, and do not be fooled into thinking one will only need the transport there and back; the entire complex alone spans 250 square miles and Angkor Thom alone is twice the size of Siem Reap. So we cycled up from the city centre, only to get to the front gate of Angkor Wat and be told that we had to buy our tickets back 5 kilometres down the road in the middle of nowhere. The guard was happy to call us a tuk tuk to do it quickly, but absolutely nowhere online, in our hotel, in the tourist map, or in the town was this made clear - so be warned. The ticket purchasing office is a large deserted building in the middle of nowhere, which turns out to be a museum; so don't worry too much when your tuk tuk driver takes you out into the middle of the countryside with no one else about. Eventually getting inside, Angkor Wat was breathtaking. Photos don't do it justice, only being there for yourself can one truly experience it. The temple itself was slightly smaller than I had imagined, but there was a good hour or so of things to see even with the main plateau being closed off on the day of our particular visit. We did this site first, as I am sure most do. Others we were with did Angkor Wat last, however, and reported that the crowds die down here towards the end of the day so doing it in reverse order might be wiser than the traditional clockwise loop.Angkor Thom, the largest of the sites, was a further few kilometres up the road and, in my opinion, a lot more impressive. The central temple itself dwarfed Angkor Wat, and despite current archaeological works provided a much quieter experience with its truly labyrinthine and claustrophobically dark passageways. The summit was a little more crowded, but not too much so. Monks waited at the shrines at the top to give small blessing rituals in exchange for a small tip, and this is where one finds the famous carved stone faces. The elephant wall, slightly further up, is probably much better appreciated from the road going past it than it is on the platform itself. However, if one ventures over its bridge and into the forest there are several smaller temples unmarked on the maps to be found in the trees behind it. Angkor Thom is probably just about doable in a day, it is so big and there are many spread out sites to see, but we had only one day and so we pressed on out of Angkor Thom for some of the smaller structures out in the jungle.The jungle itself made for a nice ride, particularly on the bikes. The other advantage here is that we were free to take things at our own pace, and stop to look at what we wished, without a self-proclaimed expert behind the wheel of a tuk tuk taking us to what he wanted us to see. Some of the smaller structures and market stalls en route to the other temples were really worth exploring and very quiet away from the crowds of the two Angkors.Ta Keo is rather popular for its view, and from the top on a clear day you can just about see the Bayon of Angkor Wat poking out of the trees. Be warned here though, the steps, if you can call them steps as opposed to a climbing wall, are very steep. During our visit a Japanese man slipped over an edge and was carried off by paramedics on a stretcher; children may want to be kept close and the less sure footed left at the bottom. Finally, we did Ta Prohm, the temple made famous by the Tomb Raider films. It was not overly crowded, but numerous American tour groups were repeatedly going past having finished the tour here so doing this temple first before the crowds arrive might be a good idea. The problem with doing this one first, would be however that the other temples simply might not live up to it! Ta Prohm was absolutely magnificent as the structure we saw that had been completely reclaimed by the jungle. Monkeys roam freely and huge trees grow out of the walls; the place has an isolated wild feeling which definitely should not be missed, making it in my opinion the best part of the site.We had originally planned on staying for sunset at the viewing platform between Angkors Wat and Thom; yet when we arrived after the closing of the other temples at 17:30, more than ninety minutes before sunset, the platform was full to capacity and the line waiting for a space was obscenely long. Others in our hostel reported a similar experience in trying for sunrise. My advice, therefore, would be that unless you want to skip half the day waiting on a crowded platform just to take a new Facebook cover photo, you should not bother with dawn or dusk, and instead focus on the rest of the site during opening hours and spend your evening exploring the rest of what Siem Reap has to offer - after a decent sleep the night before."

Great restoration works being carried out and a testament to ancient engineering feats. Worth walking in the heat for this. Just that if you eat within Angkor Thom where the stalls for tourists are, be prepared to pay 2-3 times more than what you usually pay at Siem Reap town. Overall pretty dusty to a face mask may be useful. Beggars are not an issue. Just be street savvy and not accept things from people, even monks. Make sure you read the code of conduct to enter the area."

It is not too wrong for the ambience, Siem Reap is just more quiet and clean, but it is away different when I met and interact with the people.From our Tuktuk rider, the Hotel front office staffs and almost all of the people we've met are so friendly yet polite, warm, and most of all : sincere.We use Viator to reserve a day tour to the Temples, leave the meeting point in the morning after brief introduction given by our tour leader. The tour takes about 2 hours before lunch break and continued about 2 more hours afterwards.Our tour leader is not only told us the history of each Temple and surrounding, but also advise the spots for picture taking, which angle is the best and he often offers to take our pictures too, what a nice guy ! Lunch is simple : 3 tiers food-container for each of us contains rice, Khmer sauted vegetables and beef n potato curry, and some local fruits for desserts - such as longans and \"rambutan\"After the trip, our tour leader suggest us to have foot or body massage (there are plenty of places offer this service) to relax our muscles after exploring the Temples..We just went across the street, and enjoying the 1,5 hours full body massage and pay not more than US $10 plus tip. We ended the day with Khmer food dinner in the Old Market, ordered the famous Fish Amok, vegetable soup, spring-roll and of course Khmer beer... What a nice day ! Certainly will come back again..."

There's so much to see in this park. I did a 1-day tour because, living in Southeast Asia for the past few months, I'm a bit templed out. But 1 day is enough to see the highlights, I think. Well done, Cambodia, on using this resource to generate income for your economy, and doing it in a way that preserves the resource. Very well done."

To think that a thriving kingdom existed here many centuries ago, supporting perhaps as many as a million people, is truly incredible. Beyond the temple ruins themselves, the entire area is very special. The roads are well-kept and the subtropical/tropical forests are largely quiet and peaceful. Cambodians can enter free of charge, so for many, this is a place to come and picnic, relax with friends and family, and enjoy the waterside views of the jungles and temples.

Personally that was quite enough and clearly I have not had the chance to visit every single temple site. But I suspect that many people, like me, take the view that you can have too much of a good thing. I would like to return to Angkor in the next few years but suspect that I won't.Like most SE Asian tourists sites (Bagan, Ha Long Bay, Inle Lake etc) you have to pay an entry fee. At Angkor you may buy a variety of passes, for 1, 2 or 3 days and even longer periods. On your first day you go or are taken by your guide or tuk tuk driver to the huge and impressive visitor centre. Don't be alarmed by the number of coaches, buses, minibuses, taxis and tuk tuks waiting in the vast parking area. Inside there are many ticket booths and at busy times they are all staffed. I got my pass in less that 2 minutes.I just hope that all this money is being spent on restoration work and on maintaining the park area and not being creamed off by the local Mr Big and his political cronies. Personal observation was encouraging; the park, unlike Bagan, had extremely good and well maintained roads and they employ an army of litter pickers who do a tremendous job. One final observation on litter in the park; most of it is dumped by the local people and not the tourists."

But the guy was so nice, so, we left him $5 more of tips.I definitely recommend to visit the complex in 2 or more days. By this way, you can make the small circle of temples the first day (Angkor Wat, Bayone, Ta Prohm). And a bigger circle the second day. The second day we enjoyed a lot, because there were less people on the road, as most of the people normally opt for a 1-day visit."

Getting up early to get our tickets and snag a good spot for sunrise - we weren't disappointed! Luckily for us we scored a great sunrise. We stayed only a short time at Angkor what before putting on our skates and heading to Bayon. Great decision as it turned out as we were 2 of only a few tourists so we were able to get some good shots without anyone in them. By the time we got to Ta Promh the numbers were increasing but still manageable. It was pretty hot though. Our tuk tuk driver found a beaut place with air con for lunch and a respite from the heat. Next time I would go to the ticket office the afternoon before (after 5) to get a pass. One day is enough to do 5 or 6 temples depending on you pace but I would recommend at least 2 days. We went up the top of the nearby hill to watch the sunset but we weren't in luck this time. You need to get up the top early as numbers are limited and they are strict! At each site we encountered a band of musicians who are survivors of land mine explosions. They are quite good and are trying to make a living so we gave to a number of them. It was really moving. I strongly suggest that you hire a guide (we didn't and I regret it very much). You will know them because they wear apricot shirts with an emblem on the sleeve. Check with your hotel or the travel info in Siem Reap."

The engineering and architectural feats of the Khmer Empire are a wonderful discovery for any westerner. It matches any and all those you've heard about... except, perhaps, the pyramids... but then those are surrounded by arid sand and shanty towns. Angkor is situated in rich tropical lands and the temples are often haloed with butterflies and dragonflies. The complex is vast and requires at least 3 days to savor 50% of it. If your time is tight, be sure to get to BAYON and the BAPHUON Pyramid (inside Angkor Thom), to PREAH KHAN and NEAK PEAN. We (family of 4) stayed a week and this ensured that we didn't get 'templed-out'. We spent 1/2 days at the hotel pool and exploring a bit of Siem Reap a dusty town with noise, rich smells and colors. It can seem a bit sketchy at times, but we never once felt threatened or ill at ease. Nothing much there, but there are bars, restaurants and shops to choose from. We discovered Kuriosity Kafe and went back 3 times. Tried multiple dishes and drinks and found them all to be excellent.You need to purchase personalized tickets at the official offices. All family members must be present for the photos. This can take you anywhere from 10 min. to 2 hours. The lines can be very long in the afternoons. However, there are dedicated booths for 3 day+ tickets and hardly no lines. Tickets are always checked at every temple and at all times.Would have taken a full or half-day bike tour, but back problems stopped this. We think it would be perfect for the Angkor Vat portion. Don't let the crowds or the vendors get to you. Smile and look beyond them into the wonders before you. Take tons of pics and drink gallons of water. Dollars are standard currency. Average dinner per person USD10 including water and a drink. Average Tuk-Tuk transport USD 2. Wi-fi in most places. Last minute SUNRISE tip (as of July 2016): most temples have been closed for sunrise access, so check very carefully before getting up at 4 and heading out into the wild. 3 guaranteed sunrise marvels: Sra Srei (the largest man-made pool on the planet, I'm sure -40min from town), the elevated Phnom Baken temple (close to entrance 15 min. hike up - 30 min from town) and, of course, Angkor Vat."

My daughter and I bought a three day pass for $40 USD each but we only had two days in Siem Reap so were unfortunately rushed to see all we could at Ankor in the time we had.The first day we visited the outlying temple with only our Tuk Tuk driver as our guide which was excellent. He knew how to watch for the tourist busses and avoid the lineups. Dropped us off and then we would walk thru to the other side of the temple where he would pick us up and give us another water bottle. It was 39 degrees celsius the day we where here. We were often exploring an area and totally alone which was very special. Then on the second day we hired a official guide and the same tuk tuk driver to take us to the inner temples.$35 usd for the guide for the day and $15 for the tuk tuk driver for the day. A guide is a good idea as he can explain so much about the history that you could only get by doing a lot of research before your trip. I have so many incredible photos......Its a magnificent massive archeological site. Enjoy it if you can."

You can get a tuk-tub driver for cheaper if you bargain, but Kim was a very gracious driver - he keeps a cooler of cold bottled water for his clients - and also a helpful local person with proficient English skills who will try to answer any/all of your questions. He sat down in the same table as me for lunch, and we talked more about his life in Cambodia and the country's political past and present situation. Of course, you should also do some of your own research. He's a good guy!"

There are also other very nice temples in the area and your only limitation is the time you have to visit and explore. Our tour was terrific and comprehensive and also includes temples out side of the Angkor Park. You have to have a pass to visit the Park and it is good for all temples in the Angkor Park (1-3-or 7 days). After our tour we used a tuk tuk to revisit Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom to leisurely photograph and take in the freatures and carvings of the temples. It was a very enjoyable experience."

My personal favourites were:1/ Angkor Wat - for its sheer vastness and impressive feel. Yet so much of the structure is covered by intricate carvings.2/ Preah Khan - because I love the way nature and specifically the jungle over powers the temples. As Preah Khan is on the 'grand circuit' it isn't visited as much as the more busy temples on the 'small circuit'. And those fewer people add a richer feel to your experience. 3/ Ta Prom is the best example of nature and temple fighting fluidly in stone. More beautiful than Preah Kahn, but way more crowded too"

            "review": "Preparation is key. Firstly, don't think in terms of visiting 'Angkor Wat' because although it is the biggest and (arguably) the most well-known of the Temples, it is not THE destination. The Angkor Archaeological Park covers some 400 kilometres and is made up of many temples, though you're likely to visit in a radius of 6-15 kilometres, depending on which route and temples you choose to visit. Keep in mind that some of the lesser known and smaller ones - the wondeful Baksei Chamkrong being a classic example - are often over-looked by the frenzy of tourists and you may even be fortunate enough to get time alone, as we did, to bask in the history and spirituality.I suggest a 3 day pass @ US40 (as at March 2016). This allows plenty of time to see everything without putting you under pressure. The pass is valid for 7 days which do not have to be consecutive. We skipped a day in-between to recuperate after two nearly 40 degree celcius days and it was enough to recharge the batteries. Do use an English (or other) speaking guide, and a tuk-tuk driver. Both are invaluable. It's about US$30-35 per day for the guide and US$20 for the tuk-tuk and driver. Make sure you understand your guide's English. Some are not as proficient in English and can lead to everything being lost in translation. Don't be shy about insisting on a guide you clearly understand. Talk with your guide BEFORE commencing and plan out your days - what route you'll take, and specifically ask to avoid the circuitous routes used by the majority of guides and visitors as working counter clock-wise can mean you might be lucky enough to arrive at a less crowded time. Understanding the history of what you're seeing brings so much more to the experience, from the architecture itself to why the face off Buddha was obliterated on so many facades. Do take the opposite gate or entrance to what's recommended in guidebooks. You'll be surprised by how small tips like this help beat the crowds. I will never forget the timeless feeling of entering Angkor Wat from the rear East gate - and being the ONLY person there. A fluke, yes, but something that isn't even a remote possibility by heading in the front way!!  As said, both a knowledgeable guide and tuk-tuk driver are invaluable. The Park is huge, it's dusty and dirty, it's breathlessly hot, and the last thing you want is to trudge kilometres between temples, unless your impervious to the searing heat and love trekking, of course! We saw many very tired and unhappy visitors doing the unhappy walk. Do take lots of cold water, and pre-moistened towelettes to regularly freshen up. We were at the park at 8am each morning, and finished by 1pm, avoiding the hottest time of day. Siem Reap is extremely hot and will zap your strength, even the fit and healthy, and regardless of whether your young or older. But its rewards are a once in a lifetime experience.And if you check your map, you might see the Baksei Chamkrong Temple, and you just might climb those extraordinarily precarious stairs with both your feet and hands, and you too might just be blown away by the stunning reclining Buddha hidden in the inner chamber. And if your especially blessed, you might just have ten minutes alone there to feel the spirit of the Khmer ... and your own self ... Written in loving memory of DJK, my spiritual companion on this journey."

I had no idea of what to really expect before we visited Angkor Archaeological Park but it was a place that I had vowed to visit and I was not disappointed. We were in Siem Reap for six days and so purchased a 3 day \"Angkor pass\" to the park. There are 1 ($20 USD), 3($40 USD) and 7 ($60 USD) day options. One day would not have been sufficient. Three days was a good choice for us but we could have easily used the 7 day pass as there were many places we just did not get the opportunity to explore and in hindsight this may have allowed us to better pace ourselves. The heat is unrelenting and exhausting and the terrain at many of the temples is uneven and sometimes steep with numerous steps. It is advisable to visit in the cooler parts of the day: early morning or late afternoon and always carry water and wear comfortable shoes. To say that the temples are simply amazing is an understatement. Until you see Angkor Wat in person you just cannot fathom it's actual size and complexity. The surrounding parkland is quite lovely and watching the sunrise over Angkor Wat is definitely a must. The other temples are considerably smaller but each unique and beautiful. They all tell their own story and you really need the time to be able to take it all in and really enjoy the reverence of such historical sites. We are definitely planning another visit, especially as we now know how to make the most of it."

The park opens 5:30-17:30, but individual temples open later. It looks like the park is optimised for large party tour operators, not specialised individual visitors, like photographers...I would recommend going back to opeing the park AND all temples at the same time. This allows people to select which temple to visit at what time, spreading the visitors accross the park. Now we all have to follow in the big tour footsteps... We see more people than temples...This was a bit disappointing."

I'm very glad I did went with 3 of my best friends as we have enjoyed 3 days in Siem Reap. I think it would be best to buy the one day pass ($20) prior to your visiting day so you can go see the sunrise which was by the way amazing! We arranged a tuktuk ride from our hotel the day we arrived to buy the pass and we dropped by Angkor Wat to see the sunset. We rented a van (somewhere around $30-40 for about 6 hours, to and fro) from our hotel and we were picked up at around 5-5.30am the next day to see the sunrise. I agree with the other people on here, it would be advisable to get a tour guide ($15) to orient you of the best spots to take pictures of the sunrise, of course the history and some added knowledge bout the place and culture. Angkor Wat is truly a beauty. I was so amazed as to how the temple was built with so much intricacies. Attention to detail. Very impressive. Not only the Angkor Wat; Angkor Thom, the Bayon temple, Ta Phrom and a lot more is worth seeing. So make sure to wear comfortable clothing as the weather is too hot plus a pair of very comfortable shoes or sandals as there are tons of walking. Sunblock and lots of water. Also follow dress codes as you are visiting different temples. "

There are the well-known temples of course, but the lesser-visited ones have their own charms, each is unique, plus they'll be much less crowded.A couple of recommendations:Start early, especially in the hot season (April is the hottest), and break by early afternoon. It's hot and a bit strenuous, so you'll be ready for a break and a swim after lunch. Don't burn yourself out by trying to see too much in one day.Have a competent guide. We had a guidebook, but it would not have been nearly as full an experience had we just wandered around the site by ourselves. Because of him, we visited several temples that were not highlighted in the guidebook, but were still unique and memorable, plus there were so few people, we practically had the sites to ourselves. Guides are not very expensive - we spent maybe $120 on our hotel-arranged guide for 3 days, and it was very much worth it. The guides all appear to be officially sanctioned, since they wear similar shirts.Have a great time, and 2 thumbs up!!!"

I was personally less bothered by all the vendors than I was the large your groups. Numerous bus loads of tourists walking the park in herds make it difficult for individuals, couples and families to enjoy all the sites. I think it'd be appropriate to control access and limit the number of large groups per day. Going early in the morning provides the best opportunity to enjoy the temples. Seeing the smaller temples and less trafficked temples is definitely worth the time."

He had us back to our Hotel by 1pm and that was plenty time for us as we were shattered by the time we finished! He charged us $20. We had no guide but there were many about and your Hotel could probably organise one for you if you felt it was needed.

It is stunning and shocking. Angkor is truly the highlight of my travel life and perhaps generally, my life.We hired a tuktuk driver through our hotel for our entire stay in Cambodia. Apparently included in that was him taking us to and throughout Angkor for about three days. I do recommend going for about three days if you want to see the main \"attractions\" (i.e. stunning works of man and nature that will blow your mind). Our driver also provided water and waited for us after each temple, restaurant, etc. I do recommend a driver; without this, we would have probably only been able to see 1/3 of the grounds we did with the driver. He was fabulous.Other practical advice? Dress modestly (i.e. zip off pants, although nerdy, allowed shorts when we wanted and pants when needed). Wear a hat, bring tons of water, train your bladder to grow [general rule in SEASIA] because it's hard to find a bathroom). It is ridiculously hot. Absolutely worth it; I recommend it to everyone and plan to visit again in life."

However the rest of the day that we spent at Angkor Wat was not without its difficulties. For one we did not know it was the Khmer New Year when we booked our travels. On the day of our visit to Angkor Wat thousands of Cambodians from all over Cambodia come to the temple to pray, enjoy the festivities and free concerts, even the King comes to Angkor Wat. We also did not realise (our fault) that it is the hottest time of the year in April and coupled with that there has been no rain from November last year causing it to be very dusty all over Siam Reap. The result of all these issues was that we were there at Angkor Wat in the 45 degree heat ( not sure what the humidity was), amongst thousands and thousands of local people, wit the red dust settling into our hair, face and clothes. The temples were amazing and the experience quite difficult. My husband had heat exhaustion and I felt dizzy while we were amongst the throngs. My suggestion is make sure you check dates and weather!"

However, the park is 7km out of the central area and it is much better to get tuktuk. Plan ahead and decide where you want to go, since you can only do one tiny fraction in a day. I suggest three days if you are really interested. If you just want to see the most important things because thes is UNESCO heritage site, then one day is enough. Some places you cannot enter unless you are dressed properly so think about that. There is no reading or any written explanation during the visit, so if you want to know more, get a proper guide or at least visit the museum first.You can buy water along the way.

The crowds do destroy some of the main sites so be prepared to have people push you out of the way or stand in front of you or talk really loudly right next to you. It shows how popular the park is but just be prepared. I hired a guide on the second day and asked to avoid the crowds. We still saw all the main attractions but entered them from the side or back entrances or during the slow times of the day while some of the larger groups had stopped for lunch etc. I had the bas-reliefs at Angkor Wat all to myself because we went in the middle of the day but it was still nice and cool because it was all undercover.

So if a couple use a phone in the morning and another in the afternoon.The detailed engraving is amazing - not some bland repeating images but story after story. An example is the little pig behind a cartwheel !Our tour included a stop for food (1 hour) n we needed it, so if you can afford it book a a/c car with driver and a private guide.The cold water for walking around the buildings is necessary n the cold wipes are a blessing when back to your car to move to the next amazing spot.To consider when this series of monuments was built it's amazing n St Paul's Cathedral - London would fit in one corner. Stonehenge is a embarrassment in comparison.No selection of photos can do justice to a place that must be visited - then relax with cheap 0.5$ beers in Siem Reap - ENJOY"

AK is a staggering collection of temples and monuments scattered over a large area. The park is well organized with controlled entry points and ticket checking. Go early on your first day or 5-5.30pm the day before and buy your pass to avoid queues.The Park contains a series of temples and cities that the Khmer king/emperors built over 200-300 years. Ther are several more outside the Park, some covered by the same ticket. The challenge is to pick what to see. Tour guides tend to have a set piece that includes tourist traps like the villages on stilts, a silk farm and a dance, so it is good idea to do some research. A 3 day tour allows you to see good selection at a reasonable pace. Day 1 could start at the step outside the Park which are the beginnings of the empire and are also beautiful (Rolous Group, Banteay Srei) and then work in towards the final of Angkor Thom and Angkor Wat. Do more than just the \"top ten\" style tour. The quieter places are just as interesting and let you feel the place. Start early so you get a lot done in the morning before the heat, retreat to the hotel and pool, go back as the heat starts to drop. Best gear is trekking lightweight long sleeve shirts and long pants, as well as a UV hat (not cap). The more skin you show the worse you heat exhaustion and dehydration - covering up actually cools you and is also respectful.People obsess about sunrise and sunset, especially at Angkor Wat. To be honest it is overrated, especially sunrise. What's more they look at AW from the West son you dont get the effect of the light coming up on the temples. Sunset is better but again thee is a huge focus on AW and one other site when many quieter spots can be found.Going with an air conditioned car is a big plus, especially if it is hot and when the sun is fully up. Tuc-tucs give you a breeze but less respite. Guides sound like they largely say the same thing unless you go upmarket and get someone who is clearly continually upgrading. So in general the choice was flexibility. We used Tes Chaya +855 92 999 051 chaya220001@gmail.com. In his mid-40s he is flexible, knowledgeable and a good price. his SUV is a bit older than several you will see but is just fine. As with most Cambodians he will not be very forceful about telling you what makes sense in our suggestions but if you tease him out he will make good suggestions."

The Angkor Archaeological Park is the place you want to, definitely check out. The park consists of all the temples and cities that belonged to the Ancient city of Angkor. Basically it contains everything in Siem Reap that is associated with the temples. Top attractions are Angkor Wat, Ankor Thom, Bayorn. You can do that in a day. Tickets are needed. Single day pass is $20 and 3 days is $40 USD. Tuk tuk will cost anywhere from $15 to $25 to take you from Siem reap to the temples. On the first day, I checked out the top attractions which were majestic attractions. Did the sunrise and sunset. Sunset at Angkor Wat was beautiful but the sunrise wasn't all that because it was cloudy. Just make sure the sky is clear when you go for the sunrise. Another pro tip- if you dont want to pay money to see the temples, go after the sunset. There are no guards or anyone present. All you need is a little courage and a sense of adventure, as the dark can be tricky to navigate. Best to go with a few people but some temples are more beautiful at night with the stars in the sky reflecting on water pools.. this does not apply to Angkor Wat or Thom or the major tourist attractions as Guards are always present there. Truly one of the last places on Earth where magic exists.. all you need to do is believe."

Agreeing with other reviewers, take a guide. He will get you to the right place to see the sunrise, in front of all the others, and get you round the temples when there are least tourists around. We have amazing photos when it seems we are the only ones there. The Bayon Temple was probably our favourite (those faces are just something you have to see), closely followed by the Ta Phrom, but this is not to negate the other temples, all of which have something different to offer. Wear sun protection and sensible shoes - apart from the many stairs (beware, these temples are not fit for viewing by the disabled, sad to say) on many occasions we were climbing over the stones themselves. Although undergoing restoration, this is still an ongoing task and many temples still have a long way to go, so don't expect all bas-reliefs, etc. to be pristine, but it is an amazing place to visit."

EVERYONE should make the effort once in their lives to come and see the great Angkor Wat which has been hailed as one of the wonders of the world.But there is so much more to the Angkor Archaeological Park near Siem Reap than just one site because we are talking about 400 sq kms of temples.To see a good slice of them would be a vast undertaking beyond most people's standard holiday, so you have to cut your cloth.No-one is allowed to visit Park temple sites without a pass. This costs $20 for one day and $40 for three days, so take the three day option. You will need it. Passes are also regularly checked by staff and security so always carry it with you.Another good piece of advice is make sure you get an English speaking guide which will only cost $35 for the entire day. Yes, you can try and arm yourself with a guide book and do it yourself but a guide book won't immediately tell you that toilets are round the back of that stall selling coconuts, it won't point out that important and very tiny carving tucked away at the bottom of a wall and it won't guide your steps away from where massive tour groups will swamp various sections at various times.What a guide will do is share their experience gained over thousands of days guiding tourists round the ruins. Don't forget your happiness is their goal because you aren't going to tip well for a poor experience.So for special occasions they get you out of bed a little earlier than the big groups. I was up at 4am for the stunning experience of seeing the dawn rise over Angkor Wat yet all my great memories and pictures would have been spoiled without my guide's knowledge because he got me to the viewpoint in front of the ruins early before the big tour groups arrived and he got me into what experience had shown him was by far the best spot for photographs.Within 15 minutes of my arrival everywhere behind me was choked with people. Believe me the Russians, Chinese and Japanese were there in their hundreds and they were taking no prisoners in their efforts to try and force their way closer to the edge of a big pond in front of Angkor Wat which offers pictures of the temple backlit by dawn, pictures of the temple silhouetted in the water and great panoramic shots.Because of my good position I have some great photographs and some great memories, but my guide made sure it got even better by encouraging me to walk away from this spot at a set time. The gap I left was immediately snapped up by members of a Chinese group, but my guide wasn't bothered. He knew that spot had gone past its best and he was keen to get me moved away and up a small rise by some palm trees.I had the entire spot to myself apart from three other tourists because the bulk of visitors were still crowded round the pond....so they missed the first sight and pictures of the sun climbing round and above the right hand tower of Angkor Wat which turned out to be one of the best pictures I took.My smiling guide then whipped me away for two other shots of Angkor Wat, one down the long stone entry path and one through other ruins which only worked because of the timing with the position of the sun. Find all that guidance and information in any guide book!!There is more good news for the visitor who hires a guide. By this time it is still only breakfast time, so my guide took me to a nice little tucked away stall for coffee and then encouraged me to see other temples in a specific order designed to reveal their glories to me before the big tour groups got there or after they had left, so I was constantly experiencing these fantastic ruins almost as a lone spectator without them being clogged up with masses of visitors.If Angkor Wat is the jewel in the crown then Ta Prohm runs it a close second.Jungle dominated all the temples for centuries but, whereas some sites are now completely clear and restored, Ta Prohm\u2019s soaring trees and fabulous root formations snaking over ruined stonework remain in many places and provide its famous surreal look as shot in scenes for the film Tomb Raider with Angelina Jolie.There are a host of other temples I could mention, but there is more to the Park than temples and I would advise any visitor to pay special attention to the many superb gates which exist.Their soaring solid stone gateways surmounted by giant stone Buddha faces often covered in moss or greenery are epitomised by the Victory Gate at Angkor Thom, a wonderful sight.There are many other wonderful sights but don\u2019t forget to keep a close eye on terrain and wear good trainers or boots. Whole areas involve clambering round, over or through great piles of tumbled stone, ancient staircases can be near-vertical and have no handrails and the passage of millions of feet can wear stone down so a surface which looks flat is actually sloped and can cause feet to skid. Take pictures but also take care.My final pieces of advice relate not to what you might see but to what you might need.Always carry water with you although, if you hire a tuk tuk and guide at the same time, you often find the tuk tuk driver has a cool box filled with water bottles and ice under the seat you are sitting on which he provides free of charge as part of his service. Still, have at least one bottle yourself to drink while walking round sites.Second \u2013 and very important \u2013 mosquitoes hunt during the day here as well as at dusk and dawn, so make sure you put suncream on and THEN spray Deet repellent over the top to protect yourself and repeat it at least once during the day. Can\u2019t be too careful.And talk to your guide before you set out. Hear what he or she has to say but don\u2019t be frightened of saying what you\u2019re really interested in, what you\u2019d most like to do, whether you have any physical needs such as frequent toilet breaks or the easiest access possible to sites because of dodgy knees. If you don\u2019t tell your guide these things they are not psychic. Help them to help you.Another good tip \u2013 which applies just as much when in town as out \u2013 is to carry $10-$20 dollars in small bills, mostly $1, because finding change for $20 bills or higher can sometimes be impossible. Among things I bought when touring temples was a bottle of iced tea, a coffee, a sort of sandwich and a fruit smoothie. They all cost $1 each.You don\u2019t have to follow this snippet but it is useful. Keep a rough list of those places and sights you haven\u2019t been able to get to and see. After all, you\u2019ll need an excuse to come back to Siem Reap...and come back you will. Hope all this has all been of help. Enjoy your holiday. I did."

            "review": "Gorgeous and extremely big area!. Tip 1: DO NOT CHANGE YOUR USD to KHR. You would actually get screwed over in the long run. Bring lots of small denominations. 1 USD is traded freely around the area.Tip 2: If you are not the sporty/adventurous type, if the Taxi bringing you over to your accommodation offers to bring you around the Angkor area, take it. They may also give guidance along the way (depending on the driver). It will cost 30 USD for the day. This is a fixed price by the government. (They actually show you a paper for it) If you decline, and chose to have a taxi to drive you around from the Hotel, it may rise the standard to 35 USD (That was from my hotel there)Tip 3: If you are at least the adventurous type, you can get a tuk-tuk to drive you around. I'm not sure how much it would cost, but presumably it's about 15-20 USD for the day.Tip 4: Unless you're really only there for the weekend, I'd say go for the 3 day pass. It costs 40 USD. I had paid in Riel, which made me pay 166,000 Riel. There's lots of places to see. And I mean LOTS! You only get to see/explore the 3 most popular ones in a day perhaps. Tip 5: Despite what the taxi driver says, Angkor Area is not \"Far\" from the Siem Reap center. It is roughly 5 km away just to reach Angkor Wat, so it's quite close by bicycle. There shouldn't be a need to rent a motorbike to reach the Angkor Area. Your ride can be parked for free near any of the temples when you're visiting. Just follow the norm.I went there with a taxi the first day, and then rented a 1 USD/day city-bike to go there for the second day and the third. I unfortunately was there during the brunt of the Chinese New Year time, and so there's tremendous amount of foreign tourists when I went there. Using a bicycle to go around the area is much more relaxing, and you have better control on where you go. Be sure to get a map from your accommodation so you can see around the place. I couldn't stop giggling over how big this place was while cycling!"

The ruins of these amazing old temples, the way nature has started to reclaim some of them, and the fact that you can climb all over and explore them is just fantastic. You can see all of the best preserved, most famous temples and also just walk through the woods enjoying the landscape of overgrown tumbled stones from the ruins. Just amazing. I was here about 15 years ago when it was still fairly new to tourism and there are considerable differences, some good, some bad. They have built wooden stairs and walkways over some parts of some temples, which I think is good to help prevent further damage. But now there are too many huge tour groups allowed to visit the same temples at the same time and it makes for a very unpleasant experience at times. Some of the guides for the big groups will actually try to push you out of the way so their groups can have better vantage points and I think they will have to start regulating this better if they want to avoid a backlash from tourists who don't participate in these mass-travel groups. Also, there's a ton of stalls selling crappy stuff that's not from Cambodia, and people having their children sell stuff instead of going to school. All of this needs to be regulated. Ticket sales seemed like chaos at first but it actually works pretty well. Overall an amazing place worth seeing - I hope they can keep it from being overrun."

It is convenient that is is allowed to stagger those two days inside a week. (The tickets are punched by the first check point you encounter). Visitors tickets are obtainable at the ticketing complex close to Angkor Wat. A tuk-tuk is a handy way for moving around in the Park. Tuk-tuk renal is about USD 15,-- a day. (Sometimes included in a hotel booking). Angkor Archaeological Park is a sequence of stunning historical sites; temples eight to ten centuries old in any state of repair. The crown of the visit is of course Angkor Wat, one of the top sites to visit in the world. Unfortunately, also here mass tourism takes its toll. Moving were the small music groups, playing Cambodian folk music; the members of these groups were without exception, victims of land mines. They hoped for a small donation or a sale of a CD. Angkor Archaeological Park is a top attraction in the world, on par with the archaeological treasures in Rome, Italy."

Many people seemed to cycle but I'm afraid I'm too lazy :-) If you have a good level of fitness cycling would be pleasurable but walking alone I clocked up around 12km per day so bear that in mind as it's 12km there and back again (minimum) from town.I also loved the fact that touts are kept out of the temple areas and that the temples are smoke free areas.Overall probably one of the most rewarding experiences of my life."

Don't be pressured into joining a tour group or hiring a guide and being ferried around like sheep. Do your research, plan a route, don't hang around too long and you'll be able to get all the best sights into one day ($20 ticket). We hired a couple of mountain bikes, set off around 4am and bought our tickets from the office en route when it opened at 5am. From there we cycled up without any crowds or noise, and entered the complex via the East gate completely alone (the tour guides take everyone else through the West gate for the sunrise). We were able to wander the corridors of Angkor Wat by torchlight in silence, it was totally mesmerising. Once daylight had reached us we moved quickly around Angkor Wat snapping plenty of photos before cycling to Banteay Kdei, Ta Prohm, Ta Keo temple and through Victory Gate. Here we walked around Terrace of the Elephants, Baphuon temple, Angkor Thom and the mighty Bayon temple. We left our hotel at 4am and were back by 2pm. A relatively long day on its own, with a fair few miles covered on the bike. We managed to avoid the majority of the crowds and queues of tuk tuks and jeeps. I highly recommend hiring a bicycle for this excursion. All the roads are flat and it's very easy to navigate. Just remember, do your research, plan a route (preferable the opposite of the tour guides) and don't hang around too long, you'll feel the crowds starting to thicken if you do. Most of all, enjoy Angkor!"

She came out and visited with me too. The \"Park\" itself seemed to have a pig in the water and I, personally, did not see archaeological ruins. (I have been to So. America and Tikal, Guetamala.) I didn't even see any temple ruins at the interesting places where the driver took me. I, did, however, see much vegetation and water and somefamilies. Earlier that day I attended the Catholic Church where I sat ON THE FLOOR. Had I arrived early, perhaps I would have been given a \"handicapped\" privilege of a chair off to the side. After the Mass I talked with the priest, who was from Italy and there to learn the language. He told me NOT to allow anyone at the floating village to charge me more than $5.00 maximum to go on a boat to see the \"village\". He also invited me to join him when he went to say Mass ON one of the houses at the floating village. The Floating Village is right there-on the opposite side of where the Tuk-Tuk took me-to the ticket box--tickets get purchased to go on the water, but tuk tuk driver wanted me to pay him I did not need to as I followed the earlier advice of the priest."

            "review": "\"See Angkor and Die\". I am still shaking my head in wonder.I had read that Angkor was big. After all it was a metropolis with a population of more than 1 million when there was no such city as Bangkok but I had no idea that it would be THAT BIG. It is not just Angkor Wat that you should visit, but many, many other temples and ruins that spread far and wide, each one more beautiful than another. Angkor Wat may be the crown of the Kmer empire, but other temples are the jewels that take the crown to the stratosphere. We spent 7 days in the park and yet were not able to visit them all. Tips:1. Find a place to stay inside the park. It will save you time and the efforts in visiting the major sites.2. Hire a tuk-tuk for the day. If you find a nice, accommodating driver, hire him for the entire stay. The driver will take you from site to site and wait for you until you have visited each site then take you to the next. We were so touched when our tuk-tuk driver had bottles of iced cold water ready for us after each jaunt. You will enjoy your visit much more comfortably. Did I say Angkor is big? Regular fares are $15/day for Angkor Wat/Anglor Thom, $20/day for the smaller surrounding temples, $35 for Banteay Srei, and $40 - $45 for Beng Maelea. $2-3/trip for Siem Reap, $5 for the airport. Tip the driver generously for sunrise/sunset trips and each day.3. Cost: $20/1 day pass, $40/3 day pass, $60/7 day pass for the archeological sites. Keep the pass on you at all time because checkpoints and random checks are everywhere. You will be fined $100 if you are found within the park without your pass. The pass gives you access to all the sites within the park, including Banteay Srei that is 35 km. away, but it does not include Beng Maelea (ticket: $5) that is 52 km. away from Siem Reap. We did not have time for the Roluos Group, so I don't know if the pass will give you access to the temples in that group or not. 4. Wear summer clothing, a wide brim hat and good, comfortable walking shoes. 5. The heat and humidity is brutal and oppressive. The weather is slightly cooler from mid December to mid February. While we were there, it began to cool off on December 17. Note: The air is noticeably cooler inside the park than in Siem Reap thanks to the trees in the park, another good reason to find lodging in the park.6. Wear a facemask if you can. Dust and smoke from burning garbage permeate the air. If you have underlying respiratory problems, beware. My asthma returned with a vengeance and I am still recovering from an upper respiratory infection. 7. Please, please keep your hands to yourselves and your body parts from touching the ruins, refrain from stepping on the stones strewn around and please bring back your garbage and dispose of it elsewhere. It is heart breaking to see so many people touch, rub, lean on the carvings or step on the ruins and to see so much garbage everywhere including inside the temples. Most of all enjoy Angkor, because you will probably not find anything like it anywhere on earth."

I don't think there's anywhere quite like this.However take food in with you as its generally quite expensive and under no circumstances buy for children, they should be in school not selling you overpriced souvenirs.You can cycle but really a return tuk tuk for two days you could get for 10-15 dollars.

One can easily do the small circuit in the archaeological park in ONE day i.e. Angor Wat, Ta Prom; Bayon, Angkor Thom including terrace of elephant, Buphon AND sunset from Phnom Bakeng.Angkor Wat is an amazing temple in this huge archaeological park. Build about 900 years ago, for the Hindu God Vishnu (currently Buddha idol).It is built on 3 levels. It has intricate carvings of Hindu Mythology like Mahabharata, Churning of the ocean etc.Guide is certainly needed for the Angkor Wat temple (maybe not so much for the entire park). After paying $20 entry fee, Individual full-day guide for entire park costs about $40; full day group tour is $13 each, Individual guide for just the Angkor temple is $15.Group tour includes pick up from hotel. For individual guide, you will have to take a tuk tuk for the entire day for $12 ($3 more for sunrise).Sunrise is nice, but maybe over-rated. However one can see the sunrise, then take a Individual guide for the temple alone, and then branch off on your own to see the rest of the park (Ta Prom; Bayon, Angkor Thom, Phnom Bakeng etc). This option is also good because immediately after sunrise there is almost no waiting to enter the main temple, which is on the 3rd level. Otherwise we encountered 1 hour queue at around 11 am.Bayon and Ta Prohm are amazing temples too.Just a small footnote - Hampi in India is very similar and amazing too, and much lesser crowds"

It was PITCH BLACK/ pitch darkness when we arrived. My guide had thankfully brought a small torch light. Still, it was a challenge to walk in pitch darkness!Everyone seems to descend at the lake/.pool where you can take shots of the Angkor Wat sunrise and reflections. There were about 500+ people there at the lake all ready to take the sunrise pics.Thankfully I brought my selfie stick so i could take pics without photographing all the bobbing heads of the 500+ people there!Did I like Angkor Wat? It was underwhelming for me. I had expected something more spectacular. The outside was spectacular. Inside the temple grounds, it was just so-so for me. But this is my personal opinion. You might have a different opinion to mine.Anways, the best time to visit Angkor Wat is to come here before dawn to catch the sun rise. The weather in the early morning is much cooler with lesser crowd. We were at Angkor Wat from 5am to 7.40am.For me, I prefer Ta Prohm.....Ta Prohm:This temple ruins was the place where Lara Croft: Tomb Raider movie was filmed. It is definitely the most eye catching temple ruins in the entire Angkor Archaeological Park!! Imagine seeing huge 500 over years old trees growing out of the temple ruins! Unfortunately, when I was there...escavation works are already in progress to remove all these beautiful trees. This project will be completed within 2 years. So when you go to Ta Prohm in 2018, you will no longer see these Sprung trees growing out of the Ta Prohm Temples :-( I don't know whether this is good or bad...but the uniqueness of this place will be gone. I mean - most people remember Ta Prohm as the place where there are tall Sprung trees growing out of the temple ruins right? I was here from 8am to 9am. This temple ruins is not very large. And with a private guide and car, you can visit the important parts of the temples and skip the uninteresting parts.Bayon:Bayon is the temple with all the many smiley faces. By the time I reached Bayon at 9am, my legs/knees were hurting so bad. I had taken a hard fall in Angkor Wat whilst climbing the narrow and steep steps :-( So sadly, I couldn't walk much.I only managed to skirt around the outer parts of Bayon.I'll be back!Important Reminder:Be prepared to walk and walk...and walk! Thankfully with the private car/driver, I didn't have to walk that much ;-) My driver drove all the way inside the complex to pick me up when I told my private guide my legs hurt. P.S. Check out one of the pics I posted regarding the dress code when visiting Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom.If you don't want to rush and if you prefer a much more leisurely pace, I recommend taking 3 days to visit the temples in Angkor Archaeological Park."

We did the Grand Circuit (larger of the two) the first day, with a great Tuk Tuk driver. Then headed out early the second day (7am-7.30am to beat the crowds) at Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and Ta Prohm. On the last day got up very early (arrive at 5am - 5.30am) to get a good viewing position. Whilst it wasn't the best sunrise the day we were there I wouldn't have missed it for anything."

            "review": "travel options...... The temples of Angkor are the main reason for most people for coming to Siem Reap and there are several options for getting there. In the lonely planet guide it suggests a couple that I personally think are ridiculous. So here are a couple of things to think about if you have read the LP guide and considering how to do it..1. Walking! This is just plain crazy. It is about 10km from town to angkor wat along a very busy dusty boring road. If you walk it will take you at least 4 hours there and back, and when you get there you will have to spend another 4 or 5 hours walking around the temples. Every second you spend walking along that road is a second less you spent exploring the amazing site. Sure there is another road that is marginally less busy but it has no ticket office on it. Moreover you would need to carry all your stuff with you. It is the most stupid idea I ever read in a LP guide book, and that takes in a lot of territory.2. Biking. A close second to walking comes hiring bikes. Ok so this time you only waste 2 hours slugging up and down the road avoiding being hit by tuk-tuks and motorcycles. But there is another good reason not to bike and that is many of the temple sites are best visited by walking through them. i.e. entering at one side and leaving at the other. For example, Angkor Wat itself is perfect to enter on the west side and leave on the east. On a bike you cant do this because you have to go back to the start to pick up your bike. Then you have all the hassle of what to do if the bike breaks down, as most of the bikes for hire in siem reap are really designed for pottering about town rather than some serious cycling. Sure - bike hire is only 5$ per day.....but a tuk-tuk for 2 is only 15$. 3. Motor bikes. Not actually recommended by LP but much less ludicrous given the saved time. but you still have the same issue about being unable to walk through sites.so basically....take a tuk-tuk or a car. It is marginally more expensive but you are there in about 15-20 mins. You can take a ton of stuff with you, lunch, drinks, camera equipment, kitchen sink..and you dont need to carry any of it.You only walk in the actual temples, meaning you can spend more time in the temples and less on the road,and finally you can easily organise walk through trips by getting your driver to drop you and then pick you up at a pre-arranged spot. Plus if the car or tuk-tuk breaks down it is the drivers problem to solve - not yours. Finally the drivers can generally give you good advice about what is the best time to go where, and they know the best times and places to grab a bite to eat. Hope that helps...!!"

There are a number of different tickets you can purchase which allow you to gain access for either one day, three days or seven days and they are completely worth it. I highly recommend braving the 430am start to see Angkor Wat at sunrise - it's a magical experience. If you only have one day - make sure you include the temples that comprise Angkor Thom (\"city of temples\" - the Bayon is in this section of the park) and Ta Prohm (where 'Tomb Raider') was filmed. There are also a number of temples that are outside the actual park and require additional travel to get to but Banteay Srei (the pink temple) is definitely worth it - it's about 32km outside of Siem Reap. A breathtaking experience in a truly magical place. Make sure you wear appropriate clothing - women in particular need shorts below the knees and shoulders must be covered - this was being enforced rather strictly the day we were there."

Angkor Wat is not a one trick pony. It is a large extended area that formed a mega city (so to speak) back in the day. One day is not nearly enough for this experience. Maybe a 1 week pass could see you end up with temple fatigue. If pitched at the right level a 3 day area pass could prove just the ticket. I recommend that a $40.00 (3 days use over 7 days). If you do what most do, you would buy the pass the night before your intended usage. This allows you free access to the site for the sunset photos without using 1 of your 3 days - lots of people do this - arrive about 4.45pm at ticket booth. Booths open about 4.55pm and you will be in and out in no time. You could split your 3 days Day1 Angkor Wat, Ta Phrom and Sunset at Bayon. Day2 Angkor Thom, Elephant Terrace, Leper King. Day3 Slightly out of town about 50km 1 hour or so. Kbal Spean, Banteay Srei. Day 3 allows a countryside environment and away from the crowds for a while. Just an idea."

Perfect for those who love history, art, architecture, adventure (imagine you are a tomb raider) or photography. Your camera will not stop snapping.Just be prepared for1) the crowd, loads & loads of people, but you can avoid them by visiting less popular temples or make your visits during hot hours, speaking of hot...2) the heat, though I went there during the 'cooler' season, it was still awfully hot & I found myself sweating like crazy just 5 minutes under the sun. Be sure to bring a lot of water, can buy bottled ones in the park too which are everywhere & not expensive3) the many stairs to climb, most big temples are built in tiers, & the stairs get steeper as you climb higher. You really have to climb them as some are more than 60 degrees steep & not all have rails to hold on to.Recommend a visit to Beng Mealea (another temple engulfed by the forest, quite a distance from the park / Siem Reap) too if you have time."

It is highly recommended to have a rickshaw or bike to get around to the different temples because it is very hot. We stayed until sunset and went to Phnom Bekheng. You can get elephant rides up the hill but I do not recommend because the day before we went to a Elephant Shelter, and the elephants at Angkor look worse than many in the shelter, which says to me they do not take care of them very well. Watching the sunset up at Phnom Bekheng is beautiful. There are a lot of people up there as well but they do keep track and let people in in waves. Make sure to were pants because I wasn't allowed to go into certain temples because of my shorts. Also carry a scarf if you're a women to cover your shoulders if needed. You can by flow pants and scarfs inside some stalls around to area. Don't be afraid to go some of the random little temples because they are also amazing. We walked a bit off path and found a cluster of temples with some Cambodian boys playing on them and these temples where small and unpopulated but amazing. Also don't be afraid to climb on them because there are more great views and little adventures built into that one."

My friends and I arrived at the beginning of Nov expecting it to be the off season. But there were still frequently crowds in most of the places that we explored. My best advice is to spread out your visits more than you intended, and the places that you really want to spend time exploring in solitude, do so in the mornings when everyone else is huddled en masse at Angkor Wat waiting for the sunrise or when they are all gathering on hills for the sunset. The park is massive and diverse and worthy of all of the time that you can devote to it."

It's cover all temples that you want to visit. It is fantastic and brilliant architecture and engineering. You can't miss it! We hired a tuk tuk, driver name Chea Leem ( Tel: +885 93 299 133 ). He is a safety driver, friendly and kind. We enjoy the service of him. He bring us to Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and other temples. Two days cost below USD 30 only.Beside temples trip, you must visit to pub street, old market and night market. Try local Khmer food. It's delicious not spicy like Thai food. Viva is my favourite pub restaurant. Great to have frozen draft beer and frozen margarita there. The weather of Siem Reap really killing me super hot and humid. Must drink more water and bring sun block. Overall, it's fantastic trip. We love it so much!"

You need a minimum of 3 days to explore the angkor archaelogical park. Upon your arrival, the first thing you need to do is to book tuk-tuk driver and negotiate on a price for 3 days. Dont try to strike too much of a bargain because most of them are extremely poor and their ancestral land forcefully taken so this is their only way of making a living. On day 1, inform your tuk tuk driver for picking you up at 4 am from your hotel. Once you reach angkor archaelogical park entry gate, get 3 day pass and then move to angkor wat. You can see hundreds of people jostling for a perfect spot to take that magical picture of sunrise at angkor wat. Take all the pictures you need, and then come back to hotel to rest or you can use that early morning nice weather to your full advantage to explore angkor wat, ta prohm and bayon. All this try to do it on day 1. Day 2 is for lesser known temples like banteay srei, banteay kdei, pre rup, phimeneakas, elephant terrace and terrace of the leper king. On day 3 you can continue to explore angkor or visit local artisan places and angkor national museum and shopping in pub street."

            "review": "It is worth the visit if you like history and arts!. Date: 5 - 12 November 2015. What to bring: Hiking shoes that protect your ankle. As it rained, there were many puddles. It is not advisable wearing normal waking shoes. I even saw some tourists wearing high wheels. It is really bad when some of them accidentally walked into puddles. Not to mention that you will have steps to climb and some route became muddy.Please do not bring selfie stick. Enough said! Self stick should be banned!I bought a 7-day pass for $60 on 5 November 5pm at the ticketing booth. I reached at 4:30pm, by the time there were a handful of visitors waiting. I wanted to take my time to visit as many temples as I could and I decided to buy the 7-day pass. There were different counters / lines for different passes, i.e. a few counters for 1-day, 3-day passes. 7-day passes counter has the least tourists queue. In retrospect, it is worth it as \"temple fatigue\" could happen if you rush through visiting the temples during the first three days. Moreover, having the luxury of pacing myself for 7 days allow me to choose when and which temple to visit for the purpose of 1. Avoiding large crowd of tourists group. 2. Visiting at the right time allows me to appreciate the sunset / sunrise and enjoy the tranquility. If you have time, I encourage you to spend 1 week and buy the 7 day pass. Watching sunset at Angkor Wat is no longer as comfortable, in my opinion. First of all, by the time of my visit, tourists were no longer allowed to climb up to the \"peak\" of Angkor Wat and there were simply too many \"like minded\" tourists there. By 6pm, we were asked to leave as the site is closing for the day. However, it gave me a glimpse of how Angkor Wat is like and I could prepare my itinerary to visit for the next day.6 Nov. Watching sunrise at Angkor Wat is over-hyped. First of all, I reached the temple by 5:30am and there were already 2 dozens of tourists gathering around the 2 famous ponds to view sunrise. Secondly, it really depends on the weather. During my visit, it was too cloudy to actually see the perfect sunrise that everyone is talking about. However, the nice thing about reaching that early is that after a while tourists started to go back to their hotel for breakfast or rest. Angkor Wat became much more quiet and I could actually spend good time visiting the entire place with only a handful of visitors. There are many quiet spots prior to 9am, that is when large tourists group arrive with their guides. In summary, it is fine to insert a morning or two to view sunrise at Angkor Wat. But it is not a must. After all, it is your holiday. If you want to appreciate the temple with a peace of mind, go before 9am or during noon. Also, try to buy the pass by 5pm previous day as buying in the morning is too crowded. When I passed the ticketing booth by 5am, there were many buses with dozens of tourists waiting to buy the passes. Locals informed me that March to August is low season for tourists. However, the pond might be dry if you are looking to capture the \"perfect picture\". I left Angkor Wat after 3 hours and proceed to Angkor Thom.A visit to Angkor Thom involves viewing Bayon, Baphuon, Phimeanakas, Royal Palace, Terrace of the Elephants, Terrace of the Leper King, Preah Palilay, Tep Pranam, and smaller temples around North and South Kleang.My tuk tuk driver allowed me to alight after entering through Bayon and waited for me at the end of the Terrace of the Elephants. The site is huge but walkable. I appreciate the time I spent there after visiting Angkor Wat. By the time I left Angkor Wat, it was 10am and it was the time where large tourists group arrived. They usually would visit Angkor Wat prior to coming to Angkor Thom. I spent around 3 hours at Angkor Thom. What I like: The different temples that offer unique and individual characteristics. As it is more spacious, it allows me the space and time to visit according to my pace. 7 Nov.Visited: Small Tour Circuit (Phnom Bakheng, Thommanom, Chau Say Thevada, Ta Keo, Ta Prohm, Banteay Kdei, Prasat Kravan, Sras Srang.From: 9am to 3pm.What I liked best:Phnom Bahkeng in the morning. It was a nice hike to the mountain with no one else! I understand from locals that Phnom Bahkeng is becoming too touristy as people rushed there to watch sunset. If you prefer to appreciate nature, go in the morning with good hiking boots. Other smaller temples. The temples by Small Tour Circuit are less visited my mainstream tourists with the exception of Ta Prohm.Sras Srang is a nice spot for sunset! And not a lot of tourists.What I liked least: Ta Prohm. By the time I was there, it was near noon and there were too many large group of tourists with their guides. It was impossible to walk at your pace and they have designated walking path that you need to follow. There were simply too many people competing to take photos at the designated infamous spot. I even saw a tourist sprinkling her loved one's ashes at a particular tree while her partner took her photo doing that. At the same time, other tourists were forming lines behind them to take turn to take photos of that infamous tree, with roots over a temple...8 Nov.Visited: National MuseumGrand Tour Circuit (Preah Khan, Neak Poan, Ta Som, East Mebon, Pre Rup)National Museum was unplanned but it rained. So, naturally, museum provides a good shelter and by the time I finished touring the place, it stopped raining. What I liked best: Again, it is the tranquility that some of these temples offer. Go early, before large crow arrived. Pre Rup is also a good place for sunset. 9 Nov.Visited: Banteay Srey, Banteay Samre, Landmine Museum, Butterfly Center. Pre Rup and Sras Srang.I would leave my review on Landmine Museum and Butterfly Center at the right place.Banteay Srey and Banteay Samre are further away and I took tuk tuk to reach there. It was a good experience for me as I could enjoy the scenery along the way. However, be mindful that the journey took 1-2 hours and it was dusty. Again, Banteay Srey is a touristy spot, try to be there as early as possible. Again, large crowd arrived by 11am.These two sites are worth the journey and visit. They offer different perspective that other temples do not.This is when I enjoyed sunset at Pre Rup and Sras Srang. They are nearby. If you do not mind climbing steps, go Pre Rup. By the time I reached by 5pm, there were only 20 people. Throughout the experience, it was not too bad. Definitely better than Angkor Wat and Phom Bakheng. If you do not want to climb steps, go Sras Srang. It is good!10 Nov.Visited: Preah Ko, Bakong, Lolei (Rolous Group). War Museum. Angkor Artisans.What I liked best: There are further away from the mainstream temples and it is worth the visit if you still feel up to it. Their entrance is included in the Day Pass. Less tourist, more tranquility.In summary, the sequence of temples I visited was:Day 1: Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom.Day 2: Small CircuitDay 3: Large CircuitDay 4: Banteay Srey, Banteay Samre.Day 5: Rolous Group.It provides a different flavour after visiting the larger temples like Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom when you proceed to visit other smaller temples."

But what you may not know, it is also one of the best managed UNESCO sites in the developing world. For those used to other south Asian countries, you will be pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the sites, roads, toilet and seemingly endless green reserves that wind through the enormous region where the dozens of temples are located. Those supporting the Cambodian Government in managing this incredible treasure have placed considerable energy in ensuring that the infrastructure is in place to cope with steadily rising numbers of tourists. And well managed it is!I would recommend those with cycling skills to consider bike rental and heading from temple to temple (there are dozens and everyone is different and special in their own way) by bike, The starting point at Angkor Wat is only a few km out of town and once there the riding in roads meandering through the jungle is a great experience in itself. It is incredibly safe as, unlike in Australia, all traffic respect the slow moving bikes and treat you accordingly. Actually, all the traffic is pretty slow moving! Plus, the truck and long distance traffic are located on other roads away from this tourist area. Bikes are readily available to hire in Siem Reap. We had a couple of old clunkers with no gears which was no issue as the terrain is effectively as flat as a billiard table. Best to bring a bike helmet from home if you are worried about falling as I didn't see any available locally.Another issue: how many days and how many temples? We like to potter around, see things at our own pace and hence we spent nearly a week in Siem Reap. At first we worried this was too long. But to be honest, it was no challenge to find new activities every day as there are so many temples and they are scattered around a reasonable large area. Every temple is different, with its own charm, style and features. Another plus in having more time is to help avoid the busy periods of the day especially 10-12 each morning. Dont forget an umbrella as it seems to rain every day for a while."

You can join an organised tour or hire a tuk tuk driver for the day and go at your own pace. The best way if you are reasonably fit is to hire a bike at your hotel or in Siem Reap and do the smaller or larger circuit by cycle. One out of Siem Reap, the roads are relatively quiet and you can go at your own pace, and spend as long as you like at each monument. It is all flat so easy cycling. Grasshopper tours do a very well led day trip."

I have nothing to add or remark on the excisting reviews. It is the number one temple complex and it is absolutely worth a visit. One important note though. Many reviewers write that you need at least three days to visit this place. I do agree that you can easely spend three or more days here. I did not find it absolutely necessary. The 'small route' including the most important/impressive temples can easely be done in one day and everything after that is surely impressive but adds little to the first day experience. I spend about 8 hours in Angkor and found it enough for me personally. I did not rush anything and used a tuc-tuc for transport. I do not feel bad for a second that I did not have more days here."

So choose appropriate shoes.- Its going to be hot and humid so I suggest sun block and a hat.- Ask your hotel to arrange a tutu for the day or however long you plan to go to the park as it is the way to get around, they normally carry water they sell you and keep it cold so that helps and is totally worth it- You can do one day or more to visit and just ask for advise to the hotel staff which places to choose. Even if its just one day its worth it and doable- Shopping in the markets outside the temples is completely worth it, in town you won't get better prices and the merchandise will be different so take advantage of this. Remember though to bargain as prices go down up to 50% (at least)What else, just enjoy and really my sister and I trusted the locals advice on which places to visit and it worked out just perfectly."

This is best after a visit to the main temples.The motorcycle tour will take you about half a day and cover about 60 Km. there will be no entrance fee to pay as you turn right before arriving at the Angkor entrance, this is mostly gravel road and sandy tracks so best for those with some motorcycle experience and provides a glimpse of the real Cambodia.Definitely worth a visit and should be on everyone's bucket list."

Yes visiting these temples is an experience that should not be missed by any visitors, but the management leaves a lot to be desired. The tours are all marketed as two distinct types regardless of the method of those tours (tuk tuk, tour group, guided tour, etc.) - the 'grand tour circuit' or 'small tour circuit'. This funnels the same groups of people around the same few temples in generally massive groups of rude (generally - particularly the guides), uncompromising people from mainly Asia, if our visit was any example of the trend.If that were not enough it's about time the managing authority helped the tourist hawkers to get out of these temples and the general area with the wad-loads of cash they're raking in from tourists. The experience is utterly ruined by constant harassment and bombardment of locals looking to screw over ignorant, 'rich' and naive tourists. I was literally followed for 500 metres as we left Ta Prohm being asked the same 'you buy, you buy' question. This is the indelible, lingering memory I have of the big temples here - it's time this issue was managed.I understand the cultural significance these sites have to the locals, as I do with those who have lived in these areas since before tourism was made possible here, but something has to be done. Why stalls and houses need to exist in such numbers and in such close proximity to these significant, historical sites - many times within the temple areas themselves - baffles me. This would not be allowed in most countries.Lastly, signage needs to be improved and perhaps an effort needs to be made to stop locals riding their scooters everywhere inside the park. It's difficult to take in the experience when you're funnelled towards hawkers being surrounded by market sounds and whining engine noise. A real shame as this is only going to get worse as tourists increase. Bad as it already is, see it while you can! And go in low season, seriously.This is my second visit as the first was 3 years ago - be aware that many areas are currently under 'construction' and/ or closed off for safety. This WILL alter your experience based upon when they are working."

Not to mention, cramming so many temples in 2 - 3 days will leave you overwhelmed and less likely to remember most things you experienced and saw.The drive in the park is amazing. You see thick trees on either side of the road and if you are on a tuk-tuk on a mildly hot day, there will be a nice breeze. Most tuk-tuks can be hired through your hotel (which is the preferred method of hiring a tuk-tuk to guide you through your temple hopping day) and most of them are very accommodating, providing you with cold water and a cold towel during your tour. The temples are amazing and beautiful, with thick trees and forest surrounding it. A lot of the temples are quite similar and if you've seen one, you can expect to experience the same thing in the other temples. There are of course a few more distinctive and popular ones that most tour guides will not leave out, so don't worry as you won't miss out any of these. Remember to wear proper shoes as some of the steps leading up to some of the temples are quite narrow and steep. I remember I had to literally crawl up one of them to get to the top and the crawl down was equally as daunting and tiring. The most memorable temple for me was Ta Prohm because it was very big and it's like a maze inside! Almost at every turn or corner, you can imagine how magical it was like all those years ago. Especially when there's light shining through the overgrown trees above the temple, you could really appreciate its beauty. Not to mention it's great for photo ops!Angkor Wat was beautiful too. My tip is to go during sunset and NOT sunrise. Wayyyyy too many people at sunrise and you will find it hard to snatch the perfect spot to take your mandatory \"Angkor Wat reflection against the pond\" photo. Plus, sunset colours are absolutely breathtaking compared to sunrise. Even taking photos during mid-day will give you an amazing postcard-like photo feel. There are 2 ponds in front of Angkor Wat, guides would usher everyone towards the left pond, but I realised that the right pond has more water and the reflection of the temple looked nicer ;)When you enter Angkor Wat, there's a lot of interesting carvings on the walls and it would be handy to pay a guide at the entrance to explain all these for you. But if you like exploring by yourself, you would still find it an enjoyable experience without an official guide. It's very peaceful inside the temple. But BEWARE of unauthorised scammers (shady men) hiding in dark quiet corners inside the temple waiting for tourists to step in and explore those narrow corridors. They will shove you some incense sticks for praying, ask you pray to some former statue of a buddha for good luck and health for your family and ask you to pay a donation to them in USD. They are not monks or workers in the temple but are there to take advantage of tourists. DECLINE them at the very start. Give them back the incense stick and say it is against your religion or you're not comfortable doing it (while doing this, try to be polite about it but be VERY firm and INSIST you want nothing to do with the prayers). The temples have their own donation box guarded by a monk near the main entrance. If you want to make a donation, make it there. And even after we told those men we already donated at the entrance, they came up with some silly excuse and insisted we pay them. They usually hide at the very remote corners that nobody would really walk by so be very careful when you see these people. Other than that, it was a nice place to visit. If you are there in the afternoon, temple hopping under the hot sun and humid weather, don't miss the coconut ice cream stick sold by road side vendors near some of the temples. They are simply the BEST thing to cool you down and the refreshing milky coconut flavour is just the perfect accompaniment to your day."

Just don't forget water. It will be a long temple run if you may... Hehe. Reading books is fine but I'd rather see and know all the details of the architectural designs and structure of the temple. I guess it would take a day or more to experience the sight. Anyway, it will be the best highlights of Cambodia Tour.

Here are my tips to do Angkor with young kids and still have a gala time!We got up for a sun rise and had the most productive day doing the whole circuit until 5 pm. My kids even drove a pony (extremely expensive) and elephant (again alarmingly expensive) but they deserved it for the all the enthusiasm they showed for a particularly adult attraction and endurance in walking without a complaint in the heatPeople asked me not to bring kids - 6 and 9 years but I was amazed how well they enjoyed. We took enough food and whenever they got bored asked them to take notes and photos. The guide was good and kept us regaled. But by 5 PM we were completely tired because of the heat but totally worth it. One of the most productive and overwhelming days as a family. Kids were off to sleep with my in law like logs while my hubby and I got some time alone at Pub Street. Everyone warned me against it, when I planned this trip with kids - Dont let it deter you. Kids love it if they understand, have some fun (elephant ride, pony, cameras for pics). They also had gone to musuem previous day and I had ignited their imagination already! That helped too! But ensure you take lots of food, hire a good guide, keep some entertainment handy, if possible provide individual cameras even cell cameras will do. Kids really enjoy clicking the pics in some unique places. Carry lots of water/juices,choclates, wear sturdy shoes, carry a change of clothes (it gets very sweaty) and changing our tshirts mid day enthused some fresh energy into us after a splash of ice cold water. And most importantly carry along your sense of pride for the culture. If affordable, please travel in AC car to provide some respite from the heat with kids rather than tuk tuk. That helped a lot as we were able to store a lot of things there for the whole day trip back in the car spaciously"

The $40 ticket covering 3 days of entry to the park is more than reasonable, while tuk tuk drivers seem to all charge a similar rate of $15 a day to drive you from your accommodation in Siem Reap and back while also bringing you to every temple you could want to see.

The temple had much restoration done but has much to go. I loved seeing the trees and tree roots appearing to take over the temple remains. Our driver was knowledgeable and kind. I would advise visitors to especially go to this temple."

Visiting them offers a window into a world that none of us can even imagine. If you are ever fortunate enough to make it to Southeast Asia, make it to Siem Reap, so that you can visit the temples of Angkor."

The entrance, if I remember correctly, was around US$ 20.00 (I think that now it is more expensive).One nice thing about Siem Reap is that you can find very good and cheap hotels.

This is one of the best archeological spot all over the world.Unfortunately the management is terrible.Tickets: 20$ one day. 40$ three days (to be spent in one week). It is a fact that only a little part of this money goes to the preservation of Angkor.No info point or describing board around the huge site, neither a map when you buy the ticket. Everybody, from the receptionist of your hotel to the driver of your personal tuk tuk will tell you that the ticket is valid after 5 pm and the day after, in order to see both the sunset and the sunrise at the Angkor Wat, and a whole day to visit the site. Unfortunately it is impossible to see the sunset, since you could see it only from the top of a temple which can host few tens of people, result: if you go after 5 pm you will find a queue of people one kilometer long and nobody will leave the roof of the temple at that hour. Anyway, if you want to try, remember to bring with you long pants, otherwise you will be stop at the begin of the 15 min walking path to reach the top.Sunrise instead is very suggestive and it worths the early wake up. The small lake in front of the Wat is the best place for seeing it.The best way to visit the site is rent a tuk tuk driver for the entire day. Prices should be 15 dollars for the small tour, the best one, including Angkor War, Angkor Thom and Tha Phrom, and 18 dollars for the long tour, which not includes the previous ones and includes other minor temples.Do not go to Kbal Spean, there is absolutely nothing to see."

Secondly you get to explore ancient artifices and buildings under restoration.

Entry is well organised with a compound divided into booths for 1,3 or 7 day passes so do your homework and decide beforehand. A new development since 2 years ago is that the pass has now been digitised. No need to bring a passport photo, they'll take a digital shot.

Purchased a guide book for $8usd (could pay anywhere between $2usd-$15usd depending on time of day and your bargaining) back to the tuk tuk, toilet break (the ones where you will meet your driver outside of Angkor Wat are alot better than the ones inside at the markets) and went to Angkor Thom. Started with Bayon and it's amazing! If your unsure whether you want a guide, when you get here people will offer to take you around for a donation ($10usd ish). If you love hearing about history then I recommend you get one otherwise just wing it and appreciate the temples and intricate carvings! Had an early lunch, food is very good and not that much more compared to in town and still cheap considering! Ta Prohm was excellent and definately a highlight. Go in the afternoon for the best photos and if you lucky like us it won't be busy, although be prepared to line up for some of the famous 'tomb raider' pics. Time wise - we did the small circuit and large circuit in one day, starting with Angkor Wat at sunrise and ending with Ta Prohm. Enough time for us as we were templed out and saved us $ ($20usd entry pp at the entrance gate)."

The scale, the detail and the condition of the temples (Especially Angkor Wat) is simply mind blowing.We hired a tuk tuk driver for the day for $18 USD - could probably pay around $12-15 if you bartered harder.They will stop at the ticket booth on the way where you must pay $20 USD for a day's pass or $40 for a 3 day pass. Personally I would get a one day, see if that left you all templed out. If not then a second day should suffice.At Angkor Wat I'd recommend hiring a guide (you could always try and get a tuk tuk driver that doubles up as a guide). Guides seem to have a uniform and badges. About $10 should be reasonable for a couple of hours tour. Angkor Wat is a must see. Sunrise is said to be sublime, with the reflecting pools offering amazing photos. I was there in July, so too cloudy and overcast but the photos came out nice nonetheless. There are many other smaller temples in varying degrees of restoration - from piles of rubbles through to near immaculate. They have before and after photos and you won't believe that its the same thing. Theres plenty of shops and restaurants around. Not extortionate prices: $1 for a soft drink or large water, so don't feel you need to bring loads with you. Restaurants are a little pricier at around $5 for most thingsIf you're up for a bit of a workout then I'd thoroughly recommend hiring bikes to have a pedal around. Really gives you the chance to immerse yourself in the park. Bikes can be rented in Siem Reap for upwards of $2 a day (or more if you don't fancy leaving your passport as deposit). Its then a 7km straight road to the park. You can sneak in past the toll booths but that would be naught, so don't! ;)An absolute must see if you're in Cambodia"

It is understandable that due to its world-wide fame, you cannot really expect anything other than large sums of visitors, but many of them I found very disrespectful and showed 0 regard for the local culture and customs. Many people crossing lines, touching carvings that are clearly not allowed to be touched, and going into areas they are not supposed to. It also seems that most tourists go there to take pictures and find their new facebook profile picture rather than appreciating the history that surrounds such an amazing place. It is clearly stated that you should be quiet and respectful when entering the temples, however most people show absolutely no consideration towards this. Disappointing. A World Heritage site that is well preserved, but that does not help when the atmosphere of the place is ruined by its visitors!"

Payment and photo ID must be obtained prior to entry, your driver/guide will take you to the office. The other way to travel is to hire a bike and just cycle around the temples. The roads are all flat with no hills, but because it can get really hot I would not recommend that way for kids. Also to see the main sites takes a lot of walking and cycling.

It's completely unlike anywhere I've ever been before - and I have a big passion for ruins. Quite a bit of the site has been carefully restored, though there are still lots of original parts. In particular, the towers with faces inside Bayon are stunning, and the city-temple of Angkor Wat is really the crown jewel, though there are loads of different architectures to see from different periods of Cambodian history. Fascinating stories, gorgeous structures. We went during \"rainy season,\" but actually we didn't get rained on once during the two days we were at the temple, and even the rain we did see on our trip was of short duration. There are a lot of people visiting, but the space is so massive it really isn't difficult to suddenly find yourself alone scrabbling over tree roots and masonry, even at Ta Prohm."

And no tips are required because I doubt anyone would go to Siem Reap and not check out the Archaeological Park. So do go. We did the small circuit and the grand circuit and both are amazing. The only tip I can give you is start your trips the earliest possible in the day, have a big breakfast beforhand and the skip the usual tourist lunch time to have the majority of the temples mostly to yourself. We started each trip at 6 am and could end both of the circuits (one each day) by as late as 1 PM. So if you do this, not only do you outrun alot of tourists and get alot of temples to yourself but you also have the rest of the afternoon to rest and enjoy the simple things in life at Siem Reap. Go and have a blast. You won\u00b4t be dissapointed. The only downside is that I found the tickets very expensive and if it rains, you have to protect your ticket. Mine got cut in half because of rain and they made me buy a new one. So make sure you protect it well."

Ankor was a huge playground for him. We visited the temples at our own pace and went for elephant rides every other day. We rent a car and driver/guide. In 3 days we did the must visit Bayon, Ta Prohm and Angkor Vat, that are really worth the trip. We then chose to see smaller ones, not at all crowded, except maybe Banteay Srei. These are Preah Palilay, East Mebon and Thammanon. Some are well restored, some are less so, but all have such peaceful atmosphere that we were feeling extremely well visiting these temples. Maybe the nice weather (sunny but not hot) helps as well. We spent a wonderful time discovering this UNESCO world heritage! Everything went smoothly while we were staying at a very pleasant hotel as well: Shinta Mani Resort."

We were part of a tour and were taken to an official ticket counter where we were photographed, paid our $40 fee, and got our official park pass complete with lanyard and plastic envelope. Our pass was always around our necks and guards at several of the temples we visited checked these for validity. The fee for the pass helps to maintain the Angkor Archeological Park and, for this alone, it's well worth it. We were told that there was such a thing as a counterfeit pass - not sure about that - but it is wise to buy these from the official source.These World Heritage Sites are among the most exciting in the world and I will cherish the memory of this visit for the rest of my life. I was astonished at the scale of Angkor Wat; I loved the 54 towers and 216 enigmatic stone faces of the Bayon. Ta Prohm was unforgettable partly because I'd seen images of the strangler figs and Banyan trees sprawled across the ruins of this temple and monastery complex. I also visited Bakong, somewhat earlier than the more famous temples; and I loved the South Gate into Angkor Thom. Take your time; wear comfortable shoes; and bring bottled water as the sites get quite hot and dry. Enjoy."

I got one for $10 USD (maybe overpriced, but that was after I negotiated him down) for Angkor Wat, and it made the experience much greater.Additionally, Women have to wear pants and sleeves when entering the Angkor Wat main temple (the part with the 5 pillars). If you forget to wear some, don't worry, there are bargaining shops by the entrance of the temple to buy some. You can negotiate them down for $3-$5 USD.One thing to note, if you are someone who lives in America or regularly spends USD, Cambodia accepts USD (at least, in Siem Reap). Some ATMs only allowed me to withdraw USD. This is very handy so you can bring cash with you when you visit to avoid ATM withdrawal fees as well as not have to worry about paying charges for currency exchanges."

The only reason I am writing this (because all the other reviews already say what has to be said) is that I STRONGLY recommend to go to the Angkor National Museum before starting your tour of the temples. We unfortunately went after and I regret it. There is a wealth of information at the museum (which by the way is very well done) that will help you understand what you are looking at when you visit the archaeological sites..... And believe me the museum is better than your guide book."

This allowed her to see all the sites with us as previously they were denying her entry to some.Also, they will turn you away from some sites if you aren't appropriately dressed. Keep your shoulders covered and bring a pair of pants or long skirt that covers your knees and you'll be good. You can pull the skirt/pants off afterward and enjoy your shorty shorts as you walk to the next site..."

Angkor Archeological Park has been set up to showcase and protect the many ancient temples in the Siem Reap area of Cambodia. There are too many temples to discuss each one - but several stand out from the crowd and should not be missed: Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom (an ancient city - not a temple), Bayon, Ta Prohm, Banteay Srei - to name just a few. Each one is different, with it's own personality and story. I suggest using a guide as there is too much to know about each temple to make a go of it on your own. The information and history adds so much to the visit. These temples are very majestic and beautiful - amazing to see and think about what they must have been like when they were just finished and in their glory. But - nature and tourists are taking their toll. I am guessing that sometime in the near future, access will be limited - so go as soon as you can. We were able to enter all temples and climb several levels on many - an amazing experience in itself. The sight of the fig trees and their roots growing over and through the temples is mind blowing, and while this added to the atmosphere of these temples - they are destroying them as well - nature is slowly reclaiming the area. We visited in the rainy season and there were fewer crowds. Still lots of people but not as bad as in the high season. Try to get a sunset cruise in the moat of Angkor Thom - very peaceful, no crowds and the possibility of a stunning photo op. Work with your guide or hotel for their recommendations as to the day and time to visit each temple to minimize the crowds - they are better seen and appreciated with less people."

Of course Angkor Archaeological park is amazing (although be aware the money for the park goes to a Vietnamese company not a Cambodian company?), its rated No 1 in Asia and the world. It is one place that should be in everyone's bucket list. I have been lucky enough to visit twice and I am still seeing new and amazing things. You don't get bored with Angkor and chances are you wont even see all of the Park unless you are in Siem Reap for a couple of weeks. I suggest you visit the Angkor museum before you go to the park you will have a much better understanding of what you see. Remember both Angkor Wat and Angkor Tom are still religious sites so be respectful in your dress and behavior. We were very lucky to have Mr Panha from Siem Reap Angkor Car and Tuk Tuk Service as our driver during our ten days in Siem Reap. He provided us with both an air-conditioned comfortable car for those sites further away and fun tuk tuk for sites around Siem Reap. As two women travelling alone in Cambodia, it was good to have Panha as we know he is honest, trustworthy and reliable. He took very good care of us, making sure we had free cold water when we needed it (it was 38C some days). He has a chilly bin full of bottled water with ice in both the car and tuk tuk. No matter where you want to go, Angkor Wat or Tom, Roulens group, Mt Koulen, Phare, Tonle Sap or the killing fields he knows about it and will give you great advice. He does not do Angkor Archaeological park guiding but he can guide you at Mt Koulen etc If you have time, take a walk around the local psar with him, it\u2019s an eye-opener and very educational. If you want a safe driver and English speaking guide Panha is your man. He will drive you to see the sunrise at Angkor at 5am or to the Phare circus at 8pm no matter what you need he\u2019s there. He will help you get tickets for all of the attractions including the Angkor Archaeological Park. (+855) 12 86 45 81, (+855) 975085708 or E-mail and face book panhachhouk@yahoo. You want to travel responsibly try this idea. On your way into Cambodia you are unlikely to have your full quota of kgs of luggage. Most airlines offer 30kgs but most people take nearly empty suitcases into the country and fill them while they are there. Don\u2019t take a half empty suitcase into Cambodia, fill it up with children\u2019s books, educational toys (no battery operated toys), toothbrushes, soap, shoes, technology items and other useful things. The items don\u2019t need to be new, just in good working condition. Please don\u2019t take lollies or sugary stuff and don\u2019t offer religious items, Cambodians have a diversity of religions available to them, let them choose. You can ask your hotel to distribute the items or take them to the Children\u2019s Sanctuary. If you are lucky enough to have Mr Panha as your driver, then he will know where the most need is and help you get your items to the right place. You don\u2019t have to go along if you don\u2019t want to, just hand the stuff over and then you can fill your suitcase with amazing t-shirts and other souvenirs. If you want to go when there is hardly anyone there try the off-season May to August its hot and can be very dry or very wet but there are no tourists and less pressure to buy stuff as there are less sellers. Prices are also a little better for souvenirs but make sure you pay a fair price as it's the peoples living your bartering away."

Passes are also valid for the evening before they begin so make the most of it and consider seeing a sunset at one of the temples.It can get very hot during the day. I recommend trying to visit the temples starting in the early morning, or waiting until the afternoon so it's slightly cooler.I visited with the guide book Ancient Angkor which I highly recommend. A guide may be useful on the first day to explain the history, or at some of the bigger sites like Angkor Wat to explain the bas-reliefs which have very interesting details.We hired a tuk-tuk to drive us around. Our driver was TT, he was very friendly and funny, took us to lesser known sites and always kept the esky stocked with icy cold water.For some one day may be enough, but I personally think at least two or three are better!Cover up in appropriate temple attire to be respectful and comfy walking shoes are best as there are A LOT of steps and plenty of uneven ground.Highlights included the small circuit (of course Angkor Wat and Bayon), and Banteay Srei."

Tip: The road parallel to the main road that arrives at Angkor Wat's south west corner requires you to have a pass already. They will turn you around and expect you to go all the way back to town. There is a little dirt track short cut through the forest. Its across from some shops that sell drinks. There are monkeys living within the forest so keep your eye out. Some of the monkeys will come right up and take food from your hand. Remember, a three pass lasts for a week so you can take a day off between each visit."

Since I have been a part time resident of Siem Reap for around ten years now, I have visited the Angkor Archaeological park by tuk-tuk, by car, by van, by 4WD, and by bicycle. I am now past my mid 60s and if I can do it, pretty much anyone can do it. Not that I object to using a motorized vehicle (air-conditioning can literally save your life on a really hot day) but the bicycle can take you places and give you an experience that no other form of transportation can provide. 1. Everyone you meet in the Angkor Park is friendly to bicyclists, the drinks and shop vendors, tuk-tuk drivers, guides, park officials. I usually park my bicycle next to the officials who stand outside the temples asking to see your ticket. They remember me and offer to watch my bicycle for me. Same thing goes for the girls who sell drinks and souveniers outside Angkor Wat, they stop their hard sell and want to know everything about the bicycle (I travel with my own touring bike).2. You can go places that larger vehicles can't and would take a long time to walk. For example the top of the Angkor Thom city wall has a 12 Kilometer path that is easy to navigate with a bicycle. Locals live in the Angkor Park, so there are many small paths suitable for bicycles.3. The bicycle will make you independent and able to change your itinerary as you go. If you have a vehicle and driver, you will basically be adjusting your schedule to your driver's needs. I have had drivers (of private hire vehicles) refuse to stop where I want to stop and take me where they want to go (too many times).4. You can start out alone but it is easy join other bicyclists as you travel through the Angkor Park. Every time I am bicycling through the temples I end up talking to other bicyclists and then travel with them for a while, to show them something they asked me about. Often joining them for lunch and drinks.5. It is great exercise. Just remember to find some shade every once in a while and drink a lot of water on a hot day."

I now I understand why they are one of the most important ruins in South East Asia. The entrance ticket is very well prices considering the complexity and size of these ruins. All the staff that work at the ruins are very nice and helpful. At many of the major sites there are places to buy water, snacks, and toilets. It is also easy to hire a tuktuk on the street or from your hotel that will take you around the ruins (hired for half day or full day). Although very touristy, there are still areas to explore where you can get away from the crowds. I spent three days here and could easily have spent more as there is so much to see. The top 3 ruins are a must see (Angkor, Bayon, Ta Prohm), but it is worth taking the time to visit many of the others: that are many others that are equally as amazing. Although the early morning and evening are the best times to visit for better light and to avoid the heat, I would recommend doing one visit late morning when the crowds get a bit lesser to enjoy the ruins without the crowds (but bring a hat and plenty of water)If you are in or near Siem Reap, this ruins are a must see!"

It is worth hiring a tuk tuk driver (we did this through our hotel), for your time here as they can be really helpful in identifying the best of the sites.

            "review": "Eight tips when planning your tour around Angkor Archaelogical Park. The Angkor Archaeological Park covers 15 square kilometres and there are also a few temples included in the pass not inside the park. A tuk tuk driver will cost around US$18-25 for a full day. We had a great one who had cold water waiting for us just when we needed it.First tip is decide on what pass to buy. There are three types of passes. The seven day US$60, three day US$40 and one day US$20. We bought a three day pass which is valid over one week which means in the hot weather you can break up your touring with rest days if your there a week or five days. Make sure they give you a map when buying a ticket. We did not get one and our guide said we were supposed too. Second tip, go to the Angkor National Museum if you are like us and do not know much about the history and background behind the building of the temples. The museum fills in a lot of gaps. Third tip, buy a dust mask if your using a tuk tuk some of the roads can be very dusty and if your allergic a mask will help. I would suggest you get a laniard for your Angkor Pass. This will help avoid having to whip out the pass for checking everytime you go into a different temple. An umbrella or shawl is good for those who have sensitive skins to the sun as well. We also had hand held fans which were brilliant.Fourth tip is to decide on whether to do a grand tour or mini tour. We mix and matched with our tuk tuk driver and tour guide. Some of the best temples were the smaller ones. They do not take long to look at and also are not as visited as the main ones such as Angkor Wat and Beyon Temple.Fifth tip is go one day with a guide and the other without one. A guide is great to explain and show you parts of temples you may not know about. They are also good for showing you good photo angles. Our guide cost us US$45 for the day and he was well worth it. Just make sure they are accredited and legal. We booked ours through our hotel.Sixth tip is to remember to rehydrate. We stopped several times for coconut juices from fresh coconuts at a buck each. We also drank lots of water.Seventh tip is to leave your guesthouse or hotel by five am for the sunrise viewing of Angkor Wat. Make sure you have bought your pass the night before to avoid queuing. When you get there cross over the causeway and we headed right to the pond where we got some great shots of the sunrise and the reflection of the towers. The left side seems to be a lot busier.Eighth tip is to remember to stop a while and just soak up the atmosphere and enjoy your surroundings. We were lucky to find one temple without any people and spent a quiet half hour exploring it and enjoying the peace and tranquility. Hope some of these tips make your trip an enjoyable one to the beauty of Angkor Wat and the other temples.If you found the review useful I always appreciate a helpful vote."

When I first arrived I didn't know what was the best way to get around, nor did I find anywhere that would explain it clearly, so here goes:All or most of the historic temples/wats/sites are in this park - including Angkor Wat.We went to the history museum first and learned some of the history of the main sites. That meant we could go around these more on our own and avoid the crowded areas of Angor Wat and Angor Thom. Also, we hired a tour guide for a day and having done some of our own learning on the site, meant he could show us more of the other interesting and beautiful sites which aren't so clearly explained in the museum and are less crowded.You can find official guides through the tourist info who are reliable on their info or through your hotel or trip advisor recommendations. The ones at the sites may or may not know their history of the temples and, if someone walks up to you in the temple and starts to chat with you about the place you are in it's highly likely they are expecting a tip at the end of it in the price range of a tour guide, so that can be $10 that you may part with when you had not agreed to anything.There is a one day pass $20, 3 day pass $40 and the week pass $60. The multi-day passes work over a week or, longer for the week pass, but confirm this when buying. I read you can go and buy your pass for the sunset first and it will not start till your first day, again, confirm this when buying, as I would have gone for this option if I'd known, it would have been a great day to get in without losing a day to watch the sunset as doing it in the 3 day pass makes the day very long by having to go back and forth to the site. Be sure to get a map of the park when you buy your pass. Buy the pass at the park only, anywhere else and you may run into problems.I suggest you bring a laniard to hold the pass in, as you will be showing it for every place you enter, as well as entering the park itself.There is a small tour circuit and a grand tour circuit, both are great to go around just depends on your time frames. You need a very full day to make it round the grand circuit, so if you want to do it slower then break it up, as the heat can get very hot at noon and later.Make sure that your Tuk Tuk driver or tour guide or you has enough water, as it saves you having to waste time buying it outside the site. An umbrella can be nice to provide shade in those spots where there isn't any.I believe it's only a matter of time before the access becomes more restricted to these sites, as a lot of people ignore the signs which tell you not to go into areas, plus the wear and tear on these ancient sites will take its toll over time, as the popularity of this place grows as a tourist destination.Beautiful and very interesting park - just loved it!If this review is helpful, please tick below:"

Ta Prohm is the famous Tomb Rader temple with the giant overgrown trees. Unfortunately, there are so many tourists there it is hard to really appreciate it and get good photos. Bayon Temple will give you some amazing photos that look as if they were straight from Indiana jones and the temple of doom. Even though a lot of people will be clambering at dawn to get photos inside the park for photos at Angkor wat, you can just as easily get amazing shots from outside along the reflecting pools without fighting the crowds. You will need bug spray though! There are monkeys at Angkor, so animal spotters be on the lookout. I would recommend getting a map if you can find one before you arrive, because the place is like a maze inside and easy to get lost in, there are no signs, and after you have spent time in Asia you realize that brochures and maps are a thing of The West. You can, however, buy cheap packets of postcards from the kids following you around the entrances for a small amount. It is very hot there even in the cooler seasons so expect to sweat a lot. That being said, the views are breathtaking. I would not recommend going with a large tour group if you want to get the full effect and not the rushed and not be crowded out. It is a site you may want to take several days to visit if you have time."

We went to the museum the day before which had a fabulous audio visual explanation about the temple as well as some beautiful artefacts from the various temples so it is well worth a visit before you go trekking in the heat. We also had an English speaking guide on the day of our tour who made everything easy. Tourists do need to make an effort to cover their shoulders and knees if they want to climb the central pagoda and that's not always noted. For the two outer pagoda areas it seems to be more acceptable to be in a singlet or shorter skirts/shorts but I had to buy a tee shirt for the hawkers on the way in if I was intending to climb the central and most holy of the pagodas and I saw many younger girls in very short shorts and singlets who were forbidden by the attendants from climbing the very steep woo dent stairway that now gives access to the holy pagoda tower. We bought a daily ticket but you can buy a two day our three day ticket which allows you to visit at various times of the day to enjoy the sunrise/sunset and helps to break up what is a very hot and long walking tour."

There's not much to see further down the Roluos group, especially Lolei, where the lone temple is currently enclosed by construction poles which is presumably doing some maintenance work. The Angkor Wat, usually the highlight of the Park, is a must visit, but the high number of tourists make it a tiring visit. If you can go there in the lean seasons, perhaps you will have a better appreciation (and view) of the Angkor Wat. Otherwise, it's crowded and very very hot. Most hotels have straightforward tours to save you the stress of planning, so I suggest to avail them. Anyway, you will pay more or less the same rate because you will be hiring a tuktuk driver. If you can get a driver who speaks English well, or can serve as your guide, much better."

The total distance for a mini tour could easily reach 25-30 km. If you start at 5 am like me, be ready for really hot ride. Sunscreen is definitely a must and you'll also need a lot of water, which you can buy easily everywhere along the road.Beware of taking Sivatha Road instead of the road by the river. If you continue straight to Angkor Wat you will be required to cylce 4 km back and turn left to get your tickets. It's a really disappointing thing to hear if you want to catch the sunrise.A lot of khemr people especially young girls are selling traditional scarves or postcards or bracelets. It would help them a lot if you buy from them especially in low season. Even though those whom you didn't buy from will get more pushy after that.The place itself needs no description. If you don't want to stay in the hot sun for so long, you can plan your trip beforehand and go to selected temples only."

Sam Tuktuk tours were reasonably priced (by Australian standards) but I would have paid double the price! The tour guide was amazing. He had so much information to share. We had both a guide and a driver and went to places not usually visited as well as all the popular locations. Sunrise is beautiful and well worth the 4am start. Can not wait to return."

Hire a tuk-tuk or car from Siem Reap and explore each temple on your own. Don't join a tour group as you wil be rushed. Beside Angkor Wat, temple that should not be missed in my opinion are Bayon, Ta Prohm, Preah Khan, and Banteay Srey. Then we can also do day trips to Preah Vihear, Koh Ker, Beng Mealea etc."

Definitely a sight worth visiting once in a lifetime. 3 full days there is ideal to me.I recommend the Kindle book \"The Temples of Angkor\" by David Raezer, very utility friendly. It can easily be kelp as a cheatsheet in smartphone or tablet when reaching a spot. Trust me, there are so many temples with non-English names, quite easy to get confused even reading ahead. Another recommendation is to get an E-Bike if you are experienced with a scooter which is popular in southeast Asia. The speed is faster than bike, slower than cars and perfect for sightseeing. The range is ok to make a tour between the Angkor Park and the city. Tuk Tuk is cool but sometimes it could be a bit tricky when negotiating the price. I rather save my time and jump for a ride whenever I want. Bike is nice but it is super super hot here so not cool to exercise outdoor. One thing not so cool is the heavy battery if you need to move it to hotel room for charge over night."

For me my favourite was Ta Prohm. Just the three of us arrived in a tuk tuk from Siem Reap around 4 in the afternoon and it was relatively quiet. Even though in parts there is scaffold there was still a peaceful feeling to the place, apart from the chatter of monkeys and screeching of birds! Of course the Bayon and Angkor Wat are wonderful as well but they were busier on our visits but not too bad if you visit around 7 a.m."

I don't know the size of the park, but we spent two days there and moved between temples in a small coach, and we barely scratched the surface.The temples are as amazing as you could wish, but there is a lot of walking or travelling to do between sites, and in hot weather an umbrella is a good idea as there isn't a lot of shade.The only downside is the number of young children trying to sell trinkets. They are very insistent and their plaintive cries of 'only one dollaaaaar' stayed with us for a few days."

Siem Reap will then lose its reason to be and a lot of people will have no work.Merely raising the admission prices will not solve any of these issuesWe explored over two days and that was sufficient in the April heat.

With your tour guide, you should plan carefully, depending on your fitness level and your ability to tolerate heat. In the latter regard, always invest in one more bottle of water than you think, because it is hard to buy inside. And do not miss the sunrise over the main temple. You and thousands of others will be treated to a special sight, if the weather gods smile favourably on you. I have had the experience twice, one year apart, and I would do it again if I visited for a third time. Along with the grandiose, pay attention to the small details, like the engravings.

People who\u2019d like to visit the Temples of Angor in Cambodia, choose Siem Reap as a base because of its international airport.Before the rediscovery of the temples Siem Reap was hardly more than a village, but now is a busy town with countless hotels, pubs, restaurant, etc.When we decided to go and see the famous Angkor area, of course we went to Siem Reap as well. The big mistake we made was that we didn't listen to our readings \u201e Angkor is the place to be savoured, not rushed...\u201dSince we\u2019d like to see more and more places, we can\u2019t afford financially and in time, to spend weeks at one place. For the result, there is a good expression \u201egrasp all lose all\u201d.Our Choice was a three-day exploration. Spend one day in Siem Reap , the second day visit 8 \u201eless important\u201d (it is ridiculous!) temples , starting with Prah Khan , and after Neak Pean, Ta Som,Eastern Mebon, Pre Rup, Tah Prom, Banteay Kdei, and finally Srah Srang. On the third day we started at Ankor Wat, and after Angkor Thom complex, with Bayon and after Baphoun temple, Phimeanakas temple, Preah Pranam Temple and finished with the Elephant Terrace and Leperd King Terrace.It is long even to read the names. Isn't it? Just imagine to explore all of these temples with their countless of stairs, chambers, courtyards, etc.Yes, if you\u2019re young, healthy and in top condition, it would be all right. But to be over 70, and after one spine and three knee operations, I\u2019m not ashamed to confess, that the end of the day, my only wish was to lie down and die peacefully.Luckily Ant, the tuk tuk driver, who took us everywhere and was our guardian angel, advised me to have a massage. He introduced me a fantastic massage salon (if I just could remember the name of it), where a nice girl was working on my exhausted body for an hour , and for US$ 15.- I've got the very best , invigorating massage in my whole life.To go to a Mexican pub and polish up two excellent Margaritas was the worthy finish of the day.The conclusion is that if you\u2019re in an advanced age, try to spend there more time, have a more comfortable pace, enjoy it fully.Our plan is to go back, stay longer and visit no more than 2 or three temples per day. Even Ta Prohm, the beautiful jungle temple is worth for a whole day visit, not to mention Angkor Wat.We hardly can wait to go back!"

Angkor and Siem Rheap is where uncontrolled tourism is really screwing with the natural balance of people. On one hand you have thousands of tourists who barely even see the true beauty of the environment because they are vainly taking selfies to say look at me.

A note about how we visited the archeological site: There are a number of areas of interest, each with its unique characteristics, each one a wonderful experience. We hired a guide and a taxi (that is an air conditioned taxi) driver to spend two days with us. We found it ideal to be able to tailor the schedule to our own needs, and focus on the the parts that most interested us. Our hotel (Golden Butterfly Villa) made excellent recommendations for the guide and driver. Both worked our very well. My wife and I were especially taken with our driver, Mr. Vanna (vannabeng@gmail.com) He is a lovely, soft-spoken young man who grew up in a poor farm family. After spending few years in a monastery, he learned to read. Since then he has taught himself English and Chinese.He spoke English beautifully (better than our guide's.) Although he is very knowledgeable about Siem Reap and the temples, he has no hope of ever being able to qualify to be an official guide. He is a wonderful resource!"

That way you can enjoy sunrise lights reflecting on the wall of temples and calm & quiet atmosphere.

This archaeological park consist of a numbers of temples / wats / ruins to be covered over a period of time which you can decide upon yourself according to the number of days you are in Siem Reap. Normally it's a day tour from morning till evening. This tour is published in travel brochure as the Inner Circle Tour or the Smaller tour. The main places covered will consist of the Angkor Wat, The Angkor Thom/Bayon, Ta Prohm and surrounding smaller temples.There are many options to do this tour. Cheapest will be by rented bicycle without tour guide. That means you rent the bicycle for the whole day and explore on your own. It is safe but you may be clueless of where to go but you have all the time in the world. Next will be by chartered tuk tuk. The tuk tuk driver will bring you to all the places mentioned and could also give you some basic info. Cold wet tissues and mineral waters are also provided. If you want comfort, rent an airconditioned car, SUV or MPV according to the number of people in your group. Almost all drivers speaks English and will also provide you with much needed info. Wet towels and cold mineral waters are provided after every stops. You determine the length of your stay at each stop. If you have a company of four with senior members and children and you want some comfort, this mode is highly recommended. The most expensive mode will be guided bicycle tour. It is charged individually. A guide will cycle along with you throughout the 8 hours' 28 kilometers journey. You will be guided along some very challenging routes. Be prepared for a sore buttock at the end of the days. Drinks and fresh fruits are provided at stops. Lunch is also included in this package. Therefore although slightly expensive than other modes of transportation, it is well worth the dollars."

I had to give up & sit in the shade which felt dreadful as it was supposed to be the highlight. Most of my companions looked utterly exhausted to the point of illness when they rejoined me & indeed some were quite poorly later. We had a 3 day ticket & I suggest, unless made of sterner stuff than I am, that you spread your visits out choosing early morning & late afternoon. A return trip by tuc-tuc costs next to nothing for the distances involved & you will get much more out of your visits.We went back to Angkor Wat on our third day taking a tuc-tuc from out hotel at 7:00 am & entering from the EAST gate. This was a quiet, wooded approach with monkeys to enjoy & the temple emerging slowly from trees - magical.

My husband really wasn't interested, but after our one month in Asia, he said this was the number one experience.We spent a day here. Got up for being at angkor at 5am (up at 430). We learnt that our tuk tuk overcharged us at $25, but given there were 4 of us, we didn't feel that bad (I recall it being $14 if booked through the hotel). Our driver didn't really tell us much about the ruins, but he brought us a lot of water!We spent only one day, and we did get our full of walking to all the ruins. Some people say min. Of three days, but since we are not the meditative type of history buffs, one day was spectacular! Our tips:- have lots of water on hand! - make sure to bring a sarong or have pants that cover past your knees. This is required for only one of the temples- watch out for the monks! They'll try to act like you need to go a certain way and then hassle you for money. There are lots in there doing different things, or even students asking you for money as you go through- waking up early was worth it. Even just for the fact that you're not in the scorching heat- I would recommend having a tour guide or some history. We were all a little bummed that we didn't know the meaning of different buildings and such. We tried to listen in to other groups!- wear comfortable shoes! We did all the walking in flip flops, but some people who aren't as comfortable may want to wear sturdier shoes or sandals- really high stairs - great bum work out!We saw lots of people bike riding, so we can understand how you could make a multi day experience. But on an 8 hour day, we got our full and didn't feel too rushed or that we missed certain temples. We were a group of 4 30 year olds, not in the fittest shape - but we did it!"

We also had the leisure of going for half-day tours then retreating by lunchtime to take a nap at our hotel during the hottest hours of the day.On our last day, we went to Banteay Srey which was a bit further afield, but is highly recommended because of the intricate inscriptions of the temple.

Angkor Wat is the best early in the morning for the sunrise (although you'll be sharing that view with tons of other people) but its also good at sunset. Bayon is famously covered in faces and its worthwhile. There are other smaller temples that arent as popular and are good places to go and wander around. Having a guide is nice, especially since most of the guides are wonderfully knowledgable and have an endless supply of stories for you- but this can get kind of exhausting in a day. Still worth it though if you've only got a day and are trying to soak up as much info as possible. Theres places to eat inside the part was well."

Restoration is constant, with multi national groups working to restore/repair/protect as much as possible - but the scale of the site is so huge it must be a daunting (& expensive) task. The cost of your pass will go towards this work. Using the local registered guides will get you through the visitors centre/pass process much faster than without.

It is best to have a tuk tuk booked for all day and depending on how good you are at bargaining, the prices range from $ 12 to $ 15 for the full day, worth every cent/penny/riel. The whole site is massive and when you have finished you will be well and truly 'Wat'ted out. Go prepared, the heat can be intense and the humidity is high this time of year. Take a hat to cover your forehead and neck and good SPF sunscreen. Drink plenty of water, I drank 6 litres during a full day at this site. You may also want to pack a change of clothes and leave them with your tuk tuk driver as you will sweat profusely in the afternoon heat.

If you're traveling through Cambodia, this is probably already close to the top of your list of things to see, but if it's not then you should change that right away. I would recommend getting a copy of Ancient Angkor from one of the people selling them you'll encounter on your way around to the various temples. You can get them for a few dollars. It really is helpful to know what your looking at and enriches the whole experience, which is nice because if you're not familiar with the archaeological aspects of the area the temples can start to blend together after a while. I'd also recommend getting the 3 day pass as there really is so much to see here that you could easily fill the time and still not see everything. Hiring a tuk tuk is probably the easiest way to get around the park and isn't very expensive. We got one for 12 dollars for the whole day. We did also spend a day going around on bicycle which was also really enjoyable, though also pretty tiring. Going early for the sunrise over Angkor Wat was very cool, but it gets pretty crowded so get there early if you want a good seat. My only complaint was that to get to the very top of the temple in Angkor Wat you needed to be wearing a sleeved shirt and they wouldn't let you simply wrap a sarong around your shoulders to cover up, which caused a little frustration for our group since that had been acceptable at many other temples we had visited. Though we just did a little shirt swapping and took turns going in. But keep the dress code in mind to save yourself some trouble."

They read a little about the history, carvings and meanings of the different temples and as much as we looked at photos we were still amazed at the sheer size of this Park and the size of the temple complex. You need several days to really see everything, and lots and lots of water. My kids had certain carvings and places they wanted to see but if you are unsure what you are seeing, get a guide. Knowing the history and meaning of the carvings enhances your experience and you will leave with the feeling you left a temple and not just a site. There are local villagers living in the complex, their homes built along side the ruins. It is an amazing experience.The 3 day pass is good for 3 days within a week,..they do not have to be consecutive as long as they are within that week. Kids under 12 are free but bring your passport to prove their ages. We broke up our week with a market and village tour with Bees Unlimited - great choice if you have kids so they don't get templed-out. There is great food to eat within the complex and drinks for sale everywhere. We ate lunch near the elephant temple at Vendor 38. Each stall is owned by different local families. Vendor 38 was delicious, and had a large choice.The temples are spread out, lots of ruins to climb over and lots of stair cases. This is not a wheelchair accessible place and if you are having trouble walking,go after you are better. If you cannot walk around easily you will be limited to the outer areas.If you go in March or April it is very hot and if you have kids, they will last longer if you can break up your day in a cool place. We left in the mornings and went back to the hotel to cool off in the pool around 1230 - then headed out again after 330. They temples close around 530 -6 but and hour or 2 is enough for the smaller temples.USD are ok just about everywhere, bring lots of 1$ bills many places don't have change for bigger bills. We were surprised to see some people drinking beer and trying to smoke - the temple security stopped them when they could. It is important to remember that this is a holy site, not a picnic ground. It would be the same as someone cracking open a beer and lighting up in the middle of the vatican."

So if sunrise is not impressive then wander the temple and keep an eye out! Also be careful in morning crossing bridge into Angkor Wat as there is no railing and its pitch black, take torch or use phone light. Dress respectably, it is a temple - tshirt and capris or loose pants (they sell these all over the markets so there is no excuse) and they do have dress code for climbing the temple so you wont want to miss out.

Get up at 5am and head to the temples to see the Angkor Wat in its true beauty as the sun rises behind it. The majority of tour groups arrive around 8am so you get to walk around the temples without the masses, plus it gets VERY hot at the day's peak.BEST VIEWPOINT - Do NOT follow the crowds down the middle. HEAD TO YOUR LEFT HAND SIDE. Here you will be able to see the sun rising from behind and capture the reflection in the water which is in front of you. Another thing to note.... When it gets light, quite a lot of people will leave thinking that is it. They are wrong! DO NOT LEAVE BECAUSE IT IS LIGHT, WAIT FOR THE SUN TO ACTUALLY RISE, trust me it will and be worth the wait. Get lost wondering around the mesmerising temples to which they are NOT all the same. There are so many ways to go from temple to temple.... Walk, cycle, drive, Tuk Tuk, guided tour and more. They offer one day, three days and week entry tickets. I hired a Tuk Tuk for the day who took me around the 'big and small circuit' for $20-25 and was worth it. This was great for me as I got to spend however long I wanted without being rushed by other people. If you plan on doing it this way, buy a guide book to learn more about each temple as the Tuk Tuk driver's knowledge was limited. Wear comfortable footwear to walk around and climb stairs all day, would recommend against flip flops. Also remember to wear or bring something to cover your knees and shoulders out of respect.

If you find your interested in temples not on the tour ,you can easily hire a driver with a car approx. $45 or a TukTuk $10-$20 .Tour guides are available for hire at each site from $2 -$15 .

There are crowds but only a little congestion at pinch points and stairs. We used a guide for the first visit. Its not cheap and ours bombarded us with information (our fault) we said we wanted lots of detail but it provided a good background for later visits. Decide for yourself what you want to see as they tend to plan for a second tour. If you have a good Tuk Tuk driver he will give you advice after your first visit and take you to the places the guide missed. How much you see depends on your age, resilience and interest in the history. Don't feel ashamed to admit Wat fatigue because although each temple has unique features you need to balance interest against fatigue.Try to visit Angkor Wat after lunch when the sun will be behind you and you will get better photographs. We did the sunrise because we had the time but in the dry season there is not much water at the front for the classic reflection shot."

We experienced the beautiful, haunting and ancient temples and cities for the first time this year, via a cycling tour.- in my opinion the best way to see the real Cambodia. In the now very popular Angkor complex , we avoided the hoards by entering through the West gate to Angkor Thom first. I highly recommend using this entrance, not just for the quiet but it felt like we were stepping back. You pass through jungle and ancient stone surrounded our ride, intermingled with village life. Our whole Angkor and trip experience was enhanced by our wonderful Cambodian guide Bunwath Tes from Buffalo Tours and bike mechanic/driver Proh. Awesome guys! Bunwhatv had an intimate knowledge of the art, architecture and culture that allowed you to look past the crowds and embrace the experience as it should be . Grab a bike , a decent guide like we had and your three day pass is worth it. Don't try and go it alone, you won't get its full worth. Take time to understand the intricate carvings, symbols and meanings behind the complex. architecture and art ."

I was more impressed with sunset at Angkor wat as it was less busy than sunrise.We did all the main temples but wondered around all the outskirts too and saw some smaller temples that were really quiet so don't be afraid to go off the beaten path for some nice surprises!The only problem is you do get hassled a lot to buy things there and it's hard to say no!"

You need at least 2\u20133 days to appreciate and visit the numerous temples and archaeological sites in the huge complex. Best to get a 2-3 day pass which costs 40USD, and you can use it any 3 days within the week. Do go with a guide who can point out a lot of things that you would otherwise miss if going on your own. Many guides would even pick up and drop off at the airport if you are short of time. If you are adventurous you could hire a bicycle or tuk-tuk, but an air-conditioned car with cold water is most welcome in the heat. The must do's are Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm and Bayon, but the other smaller temples are different and fascinating in their own right. You need to be fit as there are lots of steps to climb to get amazing views of the countryside from the 3rd level in a lot of the temples. Well worth spending the time to do it properly, and try to visit Bantheay Srey which is slightly further out as the carvings are beautiful."

We hired a tuk-tuk for the day and recommend it highly given the heat and humidity and dangers of riding bikes along the narrow and busy roads. $15 for the day for a chauffeur who knows where he's at and where he's going and who will keep track of you.The temple that starred in one fo the Indiana Jones or Lara Craft movies was pretty cool. That is, it was interesting to see huge trees tearing down the temples. Most of all I was amazed by the amount of work that went into excavating massive water works and into building massive temple complexes. You can't imagine how big it is by looking in a book or watching a video. You have to spend a day or more there.Not really liked: Personally the trip to see the sunrise was a waste. I'd rather have had a couple more cups of coffee and spent more time over breakfast.Hundreds of people vying for the \"best place\" to see the sunrise yet not knowing where it was going to come up. We see more amazing sunrises everyday from our east-facing window in Oregon as the sun rises over the Cascade Mountains so I'm jaded.An endless parade of people annoyingly trying to sell you stuff you don't want.

Examine every corner, crevice and stone carving, and ask yourself \"how, why.... did they do that?\" Then buy a book about it from the pesky kids, read it, and go back again for another look. Don't just walk across the mighty causeway - climb down alongside it and look at how they built it, and how every single piece of stone was carved, or painstakingly shaped to form joints that you couldn't pass a cigarette paper through.Visit the museums in Siem Reap and Phnom Penh to find out more about what went on behind this massive monument to one of the mightiest of the ancient empires.If you get really carried away with the magic and the history of the architecture and the culture, you can go to what is now Thailand, and visit Prasat Hin Phimai, Prasat Muang Thom and Prasat Phanom Rung that were built on the ancient roads that spread out across the Khmer empire across all of Thailand, Laos, part of Burma and Vietnam, and all led back to the site of Angkor Wat and Siem Reap. There are loads of others to see, but those in Thailand are well preserved and easily accessible by bus, and not so crowded.Finally, ask yourself... \"What happened to the empire ... what happened to Cambodia ?\""

            "review": "The size of the archaeological park amazed us!. We first-timers were amazed at the sheer size of this park. There are so many temples here that you have to do some picking and choosing of exactly what you want to see. Everyone has different ideas of how many days to spend, whether you should or shouldn't have a guide, whether to have a car, tuktuk or bike, and how much detail you should see. I would say to relax and enjoy at the pace you want to and the length of the visit that you want. We had a three day ticket ($40 per person) and you keep that and get it punched for three days, not necessarily days in succession. We visited the South Gate of Angkor, Bayon Temple, the royal enclosure, Phimeinakas, Elephant Terrace, Terrace of the Leper King, and the Temples of Angkor Wat for most of a day. The second day, we saw Banteay Srei and Banteay Samre Temple and then went to Ta Prohm. The third day wewent to the three Roulous temples. This, for us, was a good amount of time. If we went back, we could certainly see other temples. We were overwhelmed by how busy the entire area was. I had read about when to go for fewer crowds, and we had a wonderful guide, but there are just an overwhelming amount of tourists, so the crowds are inevitable. We had sunscreen, hats, and bottles of water, but we went back to the hotel midafternoon to relax. For us, this workied. For other people, you'll have to find your own tempo for your maximum enjjoyment."

I think you have to pick and chose what to see - if you really want to see it all maybe a week makes sense or at least all three days of the pass. Not sure what kind of visiting you want to do or how much ruins you can stomach. For light visiting I'd say the main five temples is largely enough (your choice 1 or 2 days) and the main two are a not-to-miss (Angkor Wat, Bayon). After a while it becomes a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu and might be too much of a good thing doesn't make it better. Overall we enjoyed it but it does not make the Fabulous mark in our book as before this we might have been a little bit over-templed-out with Sri Lanka then Thailand's temples especially Ayuthaya and Sukkothai. Overall great for history aficionados but a large bite for us commoners."

Yes, word has gotten out about this amazing place so it can be pretty crowded with other tourists like yourself, but 100% worth the minor hassle in my opinion. Entry into the park costs $20 for one day or $40 for any three days in a week. This gets you into Angkor Wat as well as many other temples in the area including Bayon, Ta Prom, Banteay Kdei, Baphuon, and many more. I highly recommend getting up early for the sunrise over Angkor Wat. It was spectacular. Our hotel arranged a half-day tuk tuk driver that took us there at 5am and drove us around the rest of the morning to see other temples. I also recommend seeing the temples by bicycle. We did an all-day bike tour with Grasshopper Adventures that rode though the main temple complex of Angkor Wat, the Bayon with many face sculptures of buddha, Ta Prohm the jungle temple, and through the countryside to see some other minor temples and ruins. It was a really great way to see the area from a unique perspective, get away from the crowds a bit, and get to see some structures that are only accessible by bike trail."

            "review": "How to avoid the largest croweds. Angkor temples attacked a huge number of visitors, mostly bus tours of Korean, Chinese and other Asian tourists. My recommendations to individual travellers how to avoid the worst crowds:- rent a Tuk-tuk with driver for the whole day. This should be done in the evening before your tour. Tuk-tuk is much better to experience the atmosphere than a car. Roads in the park are very well maintained. No problems with e.g. dust. Travelling by car will also not be any faster than tuk-tuk. - arrange for the tuk-tuk to pick you up from your hotel around 5am to make it to Angkor Wat for sunrise. You will stop at the ticket office on the way.- leave Angkor Wat immediately after sun-rise, and postpone the visit to its interior to the end of your visit in the afternoon.- move on from Angkor Wat to Bayon and neighbouring temples right after sun-rise, hence, you will be there around 7am, when its still cool and calm, ahead of the crowds. - Plan for a long lunch break, and/or a visit to one of the less popular temples (e.g. one that is only part of the large circle, not the small circle) in the time 11 to 14.- visit Angkor Wat in the afternoon when most visitors have moved on to other temples."

The whole Archaeological Park is Huge and if you wanted to look at every temple I am sure you could spend a month these. We just wanted a 'taste' so picked Anchor Wat (the most preserved of the temples) to do in a day trip. Firstly, it was Hot and I mean Hot. Take sunscreen, a hat and a bottle of water. To enter the Temple complex you have to walk down the causeway which is a long way if you are not used to walking. There are numerous steps to clime once you get there but anyone with average fitness will have no trouble. The Complex is awesome. It just goes on and on and every corner there is a new surprise. A lot of preasure from the local walking guides to hire them to explain everything and what all the buildings mean but we just wanted to enjoy the experience so we declined. Like the Pyramids in Egypt and Machu Pichu in S.America its a must visit site. You will be glad you did."

The whole complex is over 70 square metres in total and contains over 70 tombs, monuments and other ruins. We hired a taxi and driver to take around the complex doing the Great Circle one day and the Small Circle the next. Even so, we didn't get to see all of it so would love to go back.The monuments are amazing and although in various stages of ruin you get a real sense of their majesty and impressiveness. You're able to explore the monuments and complexes and so are able to see the ornate carvings and bas-reliefs up close.I feel so lucky to have been able to visit Angkor"

Unless you bought a tour pack that includes the entrance fee, you will have to stop here to get your ticket. THIS TICKET IS NOT TO LOSE!! They take a picture of you when you buy the ticket and it's printed on your ticket! Do not lose because before entering any temple, a person will ask for your ticket. If you have sun glasses, cap, mask or headband, they will ask you to remove them to make sure your are the one on the pic. Another advice! Girls! In some temples, if you have bare shoulders, a tank-top or bikini top on, they will not let you enter the temple! In the park it's not a problem, only to enter the temples, so have something to cover your shoulders with you.

It is an absolute free for all dogfight for photos at Angkor, which is a massive shame. Angkor will always be Angkor, but the extremely large amount of tourists being pumped into the Archaelogical city is ruining the ambiance and mystery of the region."

Totally agreed but i gonna give you some tips on what to prepare for the trp- Which temple to visit? There are tonnes of temples around but tell ya, after a while you will get so sick of all the temples. Choose only 3 temples. Angkor Wat, Tombraider's temple and Bayon Temple. Leave the rest out and dont even bother going to the sunrise. Who pays to watch the sunrise and sunset in this world? Go figure! There are free sunset and sunrise back home, dude!- Bring lots of water and forget about a hat. Bring an umbrella. Oh boy, Cambodia is hot..truly hot. Hotter than Bangkok. I can tell you i have never been in such hot country in my life, Cambodia hits the spot. Also if you could bring a fan or those electric fan, by all means, bring one. Put some sunscreen on,- Not a lot of people mentioned that you will need American dollars wherever you go. It is all about american dollars here. The entrance fee was charged in American dollars, street sellers charge you USD$3-$5 for a Cambodia t-shirt. Make sure you have enough American dollars. - Food...yeap pretty much you dont need them. You need water the whole time. The weather gets so hot that you cannot even bring yourself to eat. You will only want water the whole time. - Wear a really really good pair of walking shoes. This is the one thing that everyone should know. It does look like there are lots of good pavement to walk but when you want to climb up those stairs to the top of the temple, you need good pair of shoes.- Be prepared to be harassed by street sellers the whole time. They get on to your face so close that you cant do anything about it. Just turn them down politely.

There are two standard tours - long/big (includes Preah Kahn and Ta Prohm ... think Angelina Jolie/ Lara Croft) and short/small (Angkor Wat itself) for those on a two-day itinerary; the third day enabled us to see some surrounding countryside en route to the fishing village and visit the further afield pink sandstone, intricately carved temple Banteay Srei. Sunrise and sunset were non-events for us as it was too hazy, but worth it just to see the throngs of tourists, and maybe you'll get lucky with the lighting!

Angkor Wat and Bayon are an absolute must see, rest is optional and only if you're really into temples. Be careful of what you wear, they wouldn't let you enter some temples if you re a lady and wearing short shorts/sleeveless top. Beware of the souvenir sellers, especially the kids who run after you.

Make sure to get the clothing right. You'll want to ensure that whatever you're wearing covers the knees and shoulders. At the same time, they had better be durable and flexible as well.

It is a source of great national pride to the Khmer, and it only takes the actions of a few to ruin something for everyone. Remember to wear clothing that covers your shoulders and knees, don't shout and be careful of touching the walls and statues.

I know this will never happen but they really should put some limits to help perserve the temples. The other negative is all the people trying to sell you stuff at every temple. Even after you politely say no they still keep asking. If you plan on seeing the sunrise for a great pic near the pond I have 2 recommendation. First use a car not a tuk tuk. Tuk tuk are great but slow. Even after arranging to leave eariler I was passed by a lot of buses. Next try to get the pass the day before to avoid the lines the run to the pond when dropped off. You will be shocked by the amount off people around when the sun comes up. If you dont getA good spot be prepared the have photos with atleast 10 people holding the cell phones up"

You will have tuk tuk service (the park is massive - you'll want a ride!)2. Plan to arrive before sunrise. Hike into the park and arrive to Angkor Wat just before sunrise. Stay until 30 minutes after sunrise so crowds will enter the park and you will have unique photo opps most others will not capture. *Alternative plan is to arrive just before sunset, at which time you will have the opportunity to capture sundown over Angkor Wat. Equally breathtaking, but likely warmer.3. Be sure to go deep into the park and see as many temples as possible. We almost skipped Angkor Ta Prohm, since it was far flung. It was by far our favourite to view (it's actually the temple pictured in the thumbnail above - with the tree roots growing over the temple). Ah-mazing!!"

The next day, I visited Ankgor Thom (including Banyon, Elephant Terrace, The Leper King Terrace), Preah Khan, Bentay Srie, Pre Rup, Ta Keo. On Sunday, I saw sunrise at Angkor Wat then church before heading to the airport.I got the US$40 three day pass -- I only used it for the sunrise on the third day, but that was worth it. It's US$20 per day otherwise. The ticket gives you access to all of the temples in the area. Your ticket is checked at the entrance to each temple area.The temples are not close enough together to walk between. You need a bike, tuk-tuk or car/driver. Once they check your ticket at the gate, you can wander anywhere in and around each temple site. Everything is done in US$; only small change is done in the local currency.I did it all of the temples without a guide. Get a guide if you want to hear the explanations and stories about the temples and the carvings. You don't need one if you want to just wonder around.I got people asking me if I needed a guide, but it wasn't as bad as I expected. Between waving them off with certainty and having headsets on, I didn't get bothered all that much. There are people selling at every temple, mostly at the entrance and exit. Again, I didn't have too much trouble, though it is hard to say no to the kids, and sometimes I didn't But, I did it when there weren't a lot of other sellers around, to avoid getting swarmed. I read about being asked to buy milk formula for children and then the formula being sold back to the shop. I was caught off-guard, though, when a official-looking man in a uniform and \"police\" starting helping me. It was another way to offer guide services and trinkets for $US.The tour groups make it hard to get pictures sometimes, but I generally was able to go where they weren't."

We rented 'Green e-bikes' (electric bikes/mopeds) from Siem Reap town (google them, great company!) which we think was the best way to get around the park at our own pace at the same time as being really fun! In that 1 day we managed to see all of the temples on the main site, which was 9 in total! We also didn't feel like we were rushing around at all, and even had time to charge our e-bikes for an hour! Its such a nice, relaxing place, seeing all the temples and then riding between them in peace and quiet. Would highly recommend seeing the temples at your own pace in this way. On reflection, a 3 day pass might have been nicer just to spend more time in the peaceful Angkor complex, but if you are short on time or money, 1 day is sufficient. We also rented green e-bikes for a second day, to ride the perimeter of the West Baray (a more difficult ride, on mostly sandy track!) but a really great and exciting day out!

Read up each night before we visited specific temples and downloaded a guide to bring with us. SOOOO many tourists, and LOTS of people taking \"Selfies\" it was quite humorous. I would recommend visiting Ta Nei Temple, it's a bit of a walk into the woods near the Flight of the Gibbons location, but hardly anyone goes there, so you have the temple to yourself, with trees growing into the structure! It's quite magical."

One day will set you back $20 USD, three days $40 and seven days $60.We did three days traipsing through the temples. I loved it for all the musings about who must have lived in these places, the history and the differing architectural styles. My friend would have preferred only one day covering the best parts. But then I love architecture and she's not into that as much.Guides are available to show you more about the temples. If you can't afford a guide, I'd suggest going to the Angkor Museum in Siem Reap first as a great deal of the history is explained here (about $12 USD for entry).Be prepared for being hot and sweaty. Even in the dry season the weather is warm and you'll be walking a great deal. My friend and I are both very fit (she runs half-marathons and I'm a body-builder) but we were both exhausted after three days climbing up and down stairs in that heat. Make sure you hydrate sufficiently!You will be harrassed by small children trying to sell you postcards for $1. You will learn to ignore this and keep walking. They know how to ask in multiple languages but don't understand much of what you say, so no reasoning or logic will work with them. It feels cruel.Overall this is a very worthwhile adventure."

There are clean, free, well-maintained toilets outside every major site. Just give yourself as much time as you can, if possible visit very early morning and from mid-afternoon onwards (or you will melt), and relax in your hotel in the middle of the day. You will have a much more enjoyable experience if you can book your own private tour and time your visits to the major temples to avoid the tour groups.

Recommended to start the tour from the last temple, and go backward so you are flowing against the current and have the temples mostly to yourself! There is much to photograph, so a full battery, and polaroid filters are highly recommended!Things to watch out for: do organised bathroom breaks, while there are toilet facilities scattered all around the complex, sometimes you may have to walk 10-15 minutes before you can get to one.Also, its extremely hot so stay hydrated and sun-screened! In addition, there are many activities inside the temple complex that require entry ticket into the actual complex, so if you interested in zip lining, or ATV tours or hot air ballooning(and several others), you sohuld plan and buy multiple day tickets!"

The Angkor temple is one of a kind for me. It will usually take days to properly visit all the ruins of Angkor. The price is as following: 20$ (1 day), 40$ (3 days), 60$ (1 week). There are plenty of lodgings around Angkor Wat so need not to worry. Don't miss out the spectacular sunrise view of Angkor Wat!"

Visiting Angkor Wat at dawn was a definite highlight and worth getting up for. We bought a 3 day pass. You do not have to visit on consecutive days which was ideal for us. We hired bikes to ride around on one day and then hired a tuk-tuk for the others. An awesome experience!"

Even in the so-called winter/dry season it gets very hot and humid, and traipsing through the temples can drain one of energy. We began intending to tour morning and afternoon, as suggested by some of the itineraries in the guidebooks. But we found ourselves drained after 4 or so hours and needed to repair to the hotel to relax and swim. We would then go out for a short sunset visit before dinner. So,if you want to see all the sights in a so-called 2 day itinerary , give yourself four or at least three. Only the true fanatics of ancient Khmer architecture and culture will require more than four days -- the temples begin to resemble one another after a while and the returns diminish after the \"biggies\" (Angkor Wat itself and a few others) have been explored. My advice is to stay four nights, giving you three full days. Otherwise you will get worn out. And one more thing: unfortunately the authorities allow vendors into many of the ruins themselves, so you are pestered by them as you try to tour the sights. This is unfortunate but nothing can be done."

We went without a guide as we could not get one on time, but having read ahead and armed with a guide book, we got by. We were blown away by the architecture and the sunrise at Angkor was simply magnificient. Although Dec is supposed to be a cool month, it was still hot, humid and dusty. Bring a lot of wet issues to wipe your dusty face and also a small towel to wipe the sweat.The bit we did not enjoy that much was that it was impossible to get a picture without it being photo-bombed by one of the thousands there at the same time. There was no crowd control and people simply did what they wanted to there. I am concerned about the preservation efforts at the Angkor Wat, and hope it will still be there for generations to come."

I visited during the super-high season of end December and boy, was it chock-a-block full of tourists from all over the world. Nonetheless, it is an awe-inspiring place to visit. Angkor Wat, Bayon and all the many ruins in the area are just amazing. Get a good guide, don't just go by yourself to stand there and gawk stupidly at the ruins. You won't appreciate what you're seeing unless you have someone to explain every detail to you. A guide book just won't do it. The guides are relatively cheap to hire (about USD40-50 for a full day), you'll be contributing directly to local jobs and you will walk away with a deep appreciation of the place, its place in history and the magnificence of the ancient empires.

First ta phrom (the tomb raider temple), where we arrived early in the morning. It was beautiful and exciting and still pretty quiet. Then we made our way to Angkor Tom and obviously Angkor wat. The second you see it appear you understand what it's all about. The view is majestic and I can't believe it's that impressive. Inside there were too many people, but it was still impressive and made me feel very humble and awed. The next day we did the bigger circuit, with smaller temples and way less tourists. For us his was actually so much more awesome than Angkor wat itself. Some temples and ruins we had almost to ourselves, we climbed stairs, explored hidden rooms and felt history with every step we took, without being disturbed! Definitely go to all these places, you won't regret you did. They're impressive and they're yours for the exploring and admiring!The third day we went to a few smaller ruins and repeated some of the ones from the day before, like ta Phrom. This time there were buses and buses full of people (as it was later on the day) and we enjoyed it a lot less that way. So go as early as you can and you'll be able to experience these amazing structures without disturbance and without having to imagine what the look and sound like (peaceful!) without the hords of tourists. Loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it! Get your bike out and explore. It's been a few days ago now and I can still feel the thrill and happiness of being there."

We started around 12 plus so it was really hot at angkor wat and there was quite a lot of people still! We thought we could cover it really fast but by the time we came out 1.5h had passed. There were people selling palm juice and it was supposedly cold so I gave it a try but it tastes quite strange!! The top tier of ang kor wat requires tourists to be appropriately dressed - shoulders and knees to be covered. Then we headed to bayon, the temple with lots of faces! This temple is really pretty and there are plenty of nice photog spots and can be covered in a short time. Then lastly we went to ta prohm where tomb raider was filmed where the trees are growing viciously into the temple, pretty cool.Finally we headed to phnom bakheng for sunset and reached around 4.45pm, the climb was pretty mild.

The town had a few dusty streets, many of the guides spoke only Khmer, and any organization around the temples was not apparent. Now, 13 years later I am so impressed with the Cambodian people and their efforts to preserve, highlight and share their cultural and historical wealth. Angkor Wat is not to be missed, Ta Prohm is a testament to the power of man and nature. The story of Bayon is one of a great love for a ruler. Bantey Srea will move you with the beautifully preserved Apsaras and other reliefs. If you travel to South-East Asia, make the time to see the temples in Siem Reap."

After awhile, all of the small temples start to look like a pile of bricks piling on top of each other. If one really want to learn about the history then it's can be done by reading about them through books or online research.

I would recommend renting out a bicycle (preferably the mountain bike style which will cost you $4-5 in Siem Reap) and riding out to the park yourself. It is not far and the freedom you get from the bicycle is truly rewarding, it has the added bonus of being able to park up nice and close to the temples as well. In contrast to many claims, I wouldn\u2019t say that sunrise at Angkor Wat is essential. Unless it is a rare perfectly clear morning (hard to deduce before you arrive) it can be fairly underwhelming, as it was for me. "

We paid a tuk tuk extra to drive us around for three days. The extra was to discourage him from keep taking us to the places where they clearly get commission on sales - overpriced and overbearing shops and 'attractions'. Worked a treat and he was more communicative about the area and history rather than focused on commission. The archeological area is amazing. You need to bite the bullet and do the dawn at Angkor Wat - unfortunately we hit cloud but hopefully you'll be luckier. Despite leaving the hotel at 05:00, the crowd was too big for us to get near the pool for photos. If you want the classic sunrise reflected in the pool shot, you need to be there even earlier. Everyone has their favourite temples but, for what it's worth, my top three are Bayon, Ta Prohm and Preah Khan. Even smaller ones hold real surprises, however, and there are many spots to just sit and contemplate. Key advice? Don't rush to see as many as you can. Pick a few each day and enjoy each one's unique character."

The saddest thing though is that the steep ticket prices of 40 USD for a 3 day pass doesn't go to Cambodia much (only about 10 percent). Vietnam has been given the ownership of Angkor for 90 years or so (facts are a little iffy) and you would think you could support a deserving economy but you end up supporting a private organisation and a neighboring company (it's something Cambodians are sore about and might prove a conversation starter with your Tuk Tuk driver). I managed to get around the park without a guide pretty ok but I am sure having a guide has it's perks (there are many nearby). Some temples are more crowded than the other and I strongly encourage trying to avoid the crowds to get the best experience (this means trying to get into the temple while everyone competes for the sunrise shot and avoiding) and trying to max out even your afternoons once everyone heads for lunch. I managed to get into some temples more than once and was amazed at how I kept finding new things that amazed me."

I agree also with the comment that the many children hard-selling postcards and other goods was upsetting, but it was also a good lesson for our children about the pampered lives we in Western countries lead.Having said that, what was even more upsetting and extremely discouraging was to hear a number of locals say that 90% of the ticket money goes directly to a single wealthy family in town - not the upkeep of the temples! As you'll see from signs at various temples, there are many government-funded organisations and NGOs from Japan, Korea, China and elsewhere which restore and maintain the temples. If this is true, then it's no wonder that children are forced into selling postcards to tourists while a corrupt elite get rich on Cambodia's remarkable heritage. Pretty disgusting, really."

Graffiti (painted and carved) can be found in Angkor Wat. Visitors show disrespect to the ancient cultures by flouting the rules and wearing inappropriate attire.I guess that the Vietnamese company that effectively owns Angkor (and gives very little back to Cambodia) is more interested in short-term exploitation rather than genuine conservation.

We got a 3 day pass and did it over 4 days with a rest day which I highly recommend to recharge the batteries.It is near impossible to pick a favourite temple as they all have varying qualities but I would put the following on your must see list:- Angkor Wat- Bayon- Ta Prohm- Banteay Sri- Preah KhanPlease remember the significance of these sites and treat them with respect. That also includes wearing the appropriate clothing as I witnessed women in particular not being given access to the temples due to inappropriate attire. Don't complain if you're turned away - ignorance is no excuse.It can be physically demanding as there are a lot of steps - some of which are very steep.

Day one we visited Bayon Temple, Phimeanakas , Baphuon and Ta Prohm Temple (where Tomb Raider was filmed) and afternoon at the magnificent Angkor Wat temple.Second day visited Banteay Srei, the Royal City of Preah Khan, Neak Pean built on a small circular island and of smaller temples of Ta Som, East Me\u0301bon, Preah Rup.Third morning was the Rolous Group which are the earliest temples in the Angkor area- the Bakong Temple mountain, the funerary temple of Preah Ko and Lolei Temple.It is very hot and humid touring all the temples and there are endless locals selling souvenirs which can get a little annoying, if you buy from one there are 10 more all trying to sell more postcards and scarves.It is just an awesome place to visit and of course Angkor Wat is the jewel in the crown it is worth the extreme humidity, souvenir sellers and crowds. We arranged our guide through a tour company before we got there and although you can get a guide book and do it yourself, our guide had excellent English and showed us the best of what the area had to offer."

We were given one by our hotel and it showed it was 8km to Angkor Wat and then another 5 or so to Ta Prohm - it's more like 20km to do both (not including cycling back to Siem Reap), so definitely be aware. Our bikes were pretty badly maintained too, although they did the job.Our second day was by tuk-tuk arranged by the hotel (Rambutan, excellent hotel), which was much easier and more relaxing. It took a fair amount of time to get between temples this way too, which made us wonder how we managed it by bike! We didn't hire a guide, although I think when we go back we'll do that for one day, since there's not a lot of information provided at the temples themselves (either a guide or get a good book with a map).Having a driver for the day was inexpensive (USD15) and was great for finding temples randomly - we drove past one which we didn't know about, so asked the driver to take us there instead for a while."

First, Angkor Wat is a temple inside this park...as someone else said \"think Manhattan\". Second, get to the ticket booths in the dark of the morning and avoid the hour long wait if you go around 8AM. Third, I am walking with a severely sprained ankle in a splint so my review comes from that perspective. Sprained ankle?? Am I going to miss Angkor Wat? Never! We hired an air conditioned Lexus taxi for $50/day to take us around. He was not a guide, but his experience in where to go when to avoid the crowds was very valuable. He picked us up at 5AM - Siem Reap is 10 minutes away. I got my sunrise photo of Angkor Wat, and later the crowds we shared the experience with. We left then and went right to Bayon and except for 3 other people, we were the only and first ones there. Every doorway has a threshold (to make it difficult for the evil spirits to cross into other rooms) and the rooms are small, so I had a lot of stepping to do throughout the day; there are stairs with no railings at most places; and the grounds and long pathways are unevenly paved with stones. You can hire a Cambodian guide confidently - they'll be wearing the same shirt and ID tags. These individuals speak multiple languages well, and paid $3,000 to study for two years to become knowledgeable enough and to be able to be licensed. No one pretends to be a guide out of respect for the career. We bought the one day pass to the Park, which includes entry to all the temples and sites. After Bayon (it gets hot and humid quickly), our driver took us to see the Elephant Terrace and Ta Prohm (the tomb raider temple), having earlier passed through the narrow gate (which we shared with folks on foot, on bikes, on motorbikes, in cars, with small buses, in tuk tuks...our driver said in an hour it will take 45 minutes to pass through here) into the Archeological Park. By now some tourist groups had caught up with us, but it was still comfortable enough to have the time to look carefully at whatever we wanted, and get all the photos without inconveniencing anyone. After this, our driver took us to a restaurant in the park where they served Kmer and Western meals for breakfast. Naturally, what was going on outside the temples in these areas were regular working folks were simply going about their work, was at least as interesting as the visit to the ancient sites. At some point, I wondered if much had changed in their lives over the centuries. Off we went then back to Angkor Wat thinking the hundreds there for the dawn photo had dispersed and they had. We climbed up and around and in and out and up again and up again to the topmost tower and I'd do it again. I bought a fuschia and orange prayer bracelet ($1) up there inside the temple from a bodhisattva who prayed over me (and my foot) and it felt wonderful. By the end of the visit and all the steps down and all the walks along the terraces and pathways, I felt the Buddha's healing.The aromatic massage I had the night before helped too I'm sure. By this time, we were soaked with sweat and our driver was always ready with cold water bottles and my husband was done. It was 9AM. You can say we only glossed through the places, but we saw, we felt, we experienced it and it was great. I could only think that if I were a child living close to there, I could have played endlessly through those hallways, getting lost and found again and again, pretending and pretending to be kings and queens involved in endless intrigue. I continued on with our driver to the pink \"lady temple\" Banteay Srei and the sights through the villages we passed were uncomplicated and a view into daily Cambodian country life. After arriving back to the city, it was now around midday, I asked to visit the National Museum which houses and protects a great many statues, friezes, carvings, etc from the temples. (Entry $12, gorgeous gift shop :-) After two hours there, that included the Room of the 1,000 Buddhas, I was so glad to have chosen to visit - I learned much about the great Cambodian Kmer Regime (in ancient times) and ended being able to recognize the time period of various pieces and the temples they'd come from. We went to a 'grocery store' (mini-mart) and returned to the hotel (a plug here) the Royal Angkor Resort and Spa for a soak in the jacuzzi and a wonderful late lunch (the chef here understands Cambodian/Asian tastes and Western tastes equally well). So, if you read things that tell you you can't do the Park in a day - they are correct, if you plan to visit many more places than we did, or take things in for longer times than we did, but I am thrilled to have come to Siem Reap and visited what we did. I am so glad we didn't forsake it on account of my foot. This trip was so much more than I anticipated I could do and it's because of having rented the taxi and knowledgeable driver. Thank you, Nang Nak."

However it is easy to get away from the crowds. start at Ta Phrom and move on to Ankor Thom before visiting Angkor Wat. A guide is invaluable."

What remains of this wonderful complex is in itself a grand opulence to watch. Besides the fact that the entire complex is so well maintained and has such beautiful gardens Trees and water bodies around it, it just an awe inspiring place. I did both the big and small circuit in a day and tried to cover as many known and famous temples, but even the smaller temples in this complex are equally beautiful. There are some in absolute ruins as of today but it makes me think of the opulence this entire place might have had when most of these temples were newly made or in much better conditions. I did let go of some temples because it can be very hot in the day time and recommend you do it in two days if you are an avid history and architecture fan. Please make sure you dress appropriately for some temples thought hey allow you to wear shorts but they should be below your knees, if you are in anything that does not cover your knees and above you might not be allowed to some of the temples. Be well equipped with water sun screens and all you need as it can be exhaustingly hot, and I am saying this when I was there in November, which supposedly is the coolest month. If you have all these things in place then you will definitely have fun losing yourself to time. "

To be clear, the Angkor Archaeological Park is the large area encompassing Angkor Wat, Bayon and all the other archaeological structures that you read about in Siem Reap. There are a few further outside Siem Reap but most are here so consider the individual reviews for deciding which structures you want to visit and how much time you want to spend at each.The cost of entry is $20 for one day or $40 for three when I visited at the end of low season so the important decisions to be made before arriving are - 1) do I want to pack it all into one day or parse it out over a more than one? and 2) do I want to visit with or without a tour guide? Tour guides can be of highly variable quality. I went solo, with just a tuk tuk driver and felt that was enough, but there may have been some nuances to the architecture that I missed. If you want to contribute to the local economy and have the means, hire a tour guide with tempered expectations. If you're on a tight budget, check out the museum instead and maybe bring along a guide book for reference as you meander about. Also consider getting about on a bike if you want to get a workout in, but be ready for a fun and very tiring day!"

Am referring to the whole area here, including all the temples you get to see with your ticket ($20 for 1 day, $40 for 3 days). Everyone we spoke to said we couldn't do this in one day and they're probably right. There are a lot of temples and things to see here. HOWEVER...Before we went, we made a list. We wanted to see sunrise at Angkor Wat, Bayon, The Terrace of the Elephants/Leper King, Ta Prohm and Preah Khan (due to the places we wanted to see, we drove most of Angkor Thom too, seeing 3 of the 4 gates). If we had time, we were going to watch the sunset at Bayon (as in go back there). We got to Angkor Wat with plenty of time and waited for the sun. It was less than spectacular to be fair. This was on account of the cloud cover that just so happened to all be in the east. The sun eventually came out around 8am. By this time, we had had a decent walk around Angkor Wat. It's nice and it's certainly huge, but there is only so many things to see and photos to take. As I said, we did the tour ourselves so didn't have anyone giving us history. I don't regret not having a tour guide...We then went to Bayon, stopping at the south gates to Angkor Thom to take some photos. The area where the gates are is quite nice. Anyway, Bayon was probably my favourite temple. It's also number one on TripAdvisor (for a reason!). It is in a bit of disrepair but there is some restoration work going on there so hopefully in the not to distant future it'll be good as new. The third thing we did was the Terrace of the Elephants. It was ok. Not really anything to do or see, just a bit of a walk over the top. Same with the Terrace of the Leper King. We made our way through the north gate and on to Preah Khan. This temple is massive and not initially on our list. I'm glad it was. It's pretty much a straight walk with a whole heap of ups and downs. At one point, you can see quite far through. We were also treated here by a monk and some worshipers praying in one of the side rooms. Back through the North gate and we headed to the east gate towards Ta Prohm. Ta Prohm was my wife's favourite temple and is the one with the trees growing out of it. It is also the one Tomb Raider was filmed at. Again, we walked around here and got some good photos but there was nothing here. By this time we were fairly over temples to be fair. There is only so much stacked rocks you can see. I know everyone will have their own opinion on that but really, I don't believe we missed out on anything after these four places. Don't get me wrong, they were good but I can't really imagine spending a whole day, let-alone three here. We where back at our hotel by midday...What lets this place down is its lack of information. There are no information signs around that specify what's what etc. This would improve the park tenfold. Don't be put off doing your own thing reading my review, it's just my opinion. I just think there are only so many piles of rock one can see in a day (or 3)."

I had a tuk tuk driver each day and on reflection would have greatly benefited from a proper tour guide, despite all the pre reading I did.Lessons which I learnt is to pace yourself. There is such thing as temple fatigue and as you go from one temple to the next they can all blend into once, and I need to look at my photos to remind myself of which ones I visited. Whilst planning 3 days of sightseeing may look good on paper, it doesn't take into account the weather. I can not emphasise enough how hot it gets, especially in the middle of the day. The temperature, humidity and the walking/climbing wear you down and everyone you look at is drenched in sweat. It can be tiring and you need to have a lot of water and sunscreen on you, plus good walking shoes. I found starting the days even earlier when it was cooler was a lot better and also less crowded."

I will only rate the Great Wall of China to be above this.The Entire Park area is very large and vest. Bring a good pair of walking shoes and protect your self from the strong sunlight. We have a private Tour guide and the pace of tour are very flexible. And if you are with a large tour group may not have as much option but stay up with the group.I am most impressed with the stone carving arts on all the walls. every space on wall surface are a work of Beautiful ART. I specially loved the Elephant Wall.A MUST see at least once in your life time!"

You need transportation to get from one temple to another. There is a lot of climbing of steps to see each temple properly. The site is best toured with a government guide and driver (tuk-tuk or mini-bus) If you're young and athletic, you could also tour on your own with a good guide book and bike. Beware the electric bikes only have limited mileage so you could run out of power while touring. You can also travel by elephant on site."

We took our own pack up which we had brought the day before and after visiting all the temples we wanted we sat on the other side of the moat at Angkor and had a lovely pic nic under a tree.

I felt like a kid in a candy store trying to find the secret carvings in these temples. Didn't notice the time passing by. If you're there between 8am-4pm, there'll be lots of crowds. If you don't want to feel pressured, its best to start early (circa 530am) and normally you'll finish one of the circuit by 930-1000. That's what we did.

We initially bought a 3 day pass then had to buy another 3 day pass (should have bought the 7-day pass Fromm the beginning). The park is about 7km from the city so you can rent a bike and ride there. Once you get into the park you won't have to worry about the city traffic. If biking isn't your thing then hire a tuk tuk driver for about $15 a day. I recommend Sopheak (cell 092534185). If you like the out doors this is a place to go for a picnic by the River or lake, or climb ancient temples, and explore back trails through the jungle. If your up to it you can also buy fruits from the street vendors and feed the monkeys on your trek. If you have time take another day to hire a driver (no tuk tuk) to get you to Kulen Mountain and swim in the waterfall. Angkor Wat is one of my favorite sites of this trip.

Recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site for its cultural importance, the Angkor Archeological Park spans over 400 square kilometres. Uniquely characterised by temples and city structures that date from the 9th to 14th centuries, these represent the remains of the Khmer empire at its highest glory. Some of the most iconic buildings are the easiest to visit but take the trouble to visit some of the less famous (and more isolated) sites and you'll benefit from experiencing them with less tourists around. You can get around by arranging your own transport (taxi, tuk-tuk) but having a local guide is invaluable if you want to get deeper in terms of understanding the history of the time and the importance of the various sites. Unfortunately, looting of artifacts sometimes still goes on, so it's important that ongoing efforts to preserve and improve the safety of the sites are successful."

Also we hired an English speaking guide at the entrance of Angkor Wat for $16 USD, less than half the price the hotel was charging. The temples were amazing. Wear good shoes as there is a lot of slippery rocks and wood to walk on. Also note that if you want to go up to the third level of the temple you must have long shorts on and sleeves. They would not allow short shorts or skirts or exposed shoulder to enter. A scarf wrap was not enough. Children under 12 are not permitted to go up either."

I have had the great pleasure to visit the whole Angkor's temples in July 2014 (19th to 23rd) and these moments are integrated in my mind and for a long time.The temples are for a large part of them included in the jungle and the connection between the nature and the trees to the stones and the monuments creates at any moment a very strong and precious atmosphere.For advices, you need to go to Angkor Wat at different moments of a day to see carefully the lights of the sun and the reflection to the water which organize different amazing views and you need to go also to Ta Prohm and to stay there a long time to wait for silence and to appreciate the spirit of Khmer civilzation.And don't forget to go also to the Bayon to look for the smiles of the bodhisattvas and to be part of them.And take a tuk-tuk for a trip to the one thousand lingas' valley (about 65km on the north of Siem Reap), you have to climb on the forest but the landscape is marvellous and the river with the statues and signs of religion are very interesting.So go in Siem Reap, buy your Angkor passport for three days (the entry of the temples are free after and you can return back several times to visit them) and enjoy the visits which will stay in your head a long time.\u00c9ric"

Highlights: Of course you don't want to miss the iconic Angor Wat for a classic snapshot in front of the small pond with the temple in the background. We enjoyed walking around the grounds of Angor Wat and we actually sat in on a class of monks who were learning Thai language. They have options of tour guides, but we explored the temple on our own. Be prepared to hear lots of \"hey lady\"'s and be pulled on by small children trying to sell various goods such as postcards, clothing, and other souvenir items.

We hired a driver through the hotel to take us around.Many of the places had wooden steps with hand rails installed just above the stone steps, which made it easier to navigate around. Some places have super steep, narrow steps with no rails (where you have to step sideways). There is a dress code, and if you're a woman, long pants (or past your knees) are probably easier to climb steps in than in a long skirt). If I recall correctly, we were told no long skirts at some areas of Angkor Wat or shawls to cover up shoulders, so it's probably easiest to wear the pants and short sleeved shirt that covers the shoulders so you are not turned away.Be prepared for lots of people asking for money around and inside the temple complexes. Some are selling books, etc. Others try to pull you into a dark corner, ask you to burn incense for Buddha, then ask for $10 USD for Buddha. There is a western toilet near one of the food stands in the area. If you buy water at a stand, you can bargain them down. Someone wanted over $1 for one water bottle and we started walking toward another stand and we were able to bargain down. At one stand we paid 50 cents per bottle after negotiating.Bring water and a hat as the heat can be intense. It does get crowded at many spots, so it is hard to get a great photo without people in it, but it's very much worth the trip here."

It is also depending on how much time you have and what level of your interest are. There are dozens of temple ruins in the Angkor Archaeological Park spread across more than 400 square km. I took 3 days tour and it's still not enough time and felt that there are much more to see even with the private tour guide and my itinerary that I stick with it and did what my tour guide suggested. Best is do some extensive research before coming to this park and know exactly what you want to see or do around this area. The temples are too far apart to make foot travel practical. To make my visit to these temple practical, my tour guide had a driver dropped us off and picked us up base on my itinerary. We started with Angkor Wat, then Angkor Tom from the front, then to Angelina Jolie Tomb Riders in the back of the park, then moved to Bayon Temple, West Baray and lastly Ta Phnom Bakheng ( NOT in order of the locations rather with our priority and that way if we run out of time, we wouldn't feel we miss what we wanted to see). Without a vehicle, it would be a lot of walking to do and it's extremely hot and humid that will tire you out quickly( you might not enjoy it as much)Fee for 3 days is $40 and children under 12 is FREE.

            "review": "Mesmerising. Merely talking of the beauty, the majesty of the place will not help any of the readers. You just have to be there to experience the grandeur of the place. The park is huge and as such you cannot cover it in just one day. The one day ticket to the park is 20 USD, for 3 days its 40 USD and for 5 days its 60USD. The 3 or 5 days do not need to be consecutive, its any 3 or 5 days in a week. To enjoy all the sites, without hurrying through like a tour group, you need 3 to 4 days, so it makes sense to buy the multiple day tickets. The same ticket is valid for entry to all the temples, so keep it secure. The main attractions, of course are Angkor Wat and Bayon. You can easily cover both along with Ta Prohm (the jungle temple where Tomb Raider was shot) in the same day. In fact, there is a readymade itinerary followed by all tuk tuk and car drivers called Small Tour, or Small Circuit. It starts from Angkor Vat, then goes to Banteay Kdei, Ta Prohm, Prasat Kvan, Ta Keo, the Leper King Terrace and Elephant Terrace and finally Bayon. You can pass the Victory Gate on the way back to the city. On July 2014, this was worth USD13-15 on a tuk tuk (excluding ticket price of course).Then there is the Grand Tour, which takes you to Banteay Srei, Pre Rup, East Mebon, Ta Som, Preah Khan etc. The road to Banteay Sreai also passes the Landmine Museum. Its a very evocative place, consider checking it out on the way back. Ticket prices were 3 USD, from September it would be 5 USD but its worth it, and the money goes into taking care of victims of landmines, so its a worthwhile visit. On another day, you can go to the Roulos Group of temples. You can combine it with either Tonle Sap or Beng Melea. Take a guide on the first day just to get a sense and bearing of the place. For the subsequent days you can go on your own, the tuk tuk drivers know working English and with the help of maps (freely available) will take you to wherever you want to go. If you don't want to depend on tuk tuk drivers and if you fit, you can get bicycles (many hotels give them for free) and easily ride to all the temples in the short tour. Wear good comfortable sneakers and shoes and carry/drink plenty of water and you will be fine. Remember that these were religious structures so don't disrespect the locals or the structures. Wear normal clothes and you are fine. Shorts and t shirts are ok almost everywhere except the inner sanctum of Angkor Vat. Both men and women need to cover up their shoulders and knees to enter the inner sanctum. The Cambodians are very very friendly and helpful people, so don't take advantage of them. Its a must see place and I absolutely loved it and will go there again whenever I have the chance."

The way the ruins are exploited for the tourism industry is not sustainable, the conservation of the buildings is far from being acceptable, in spite of being a World Heritage Site by Unesco.

I noticed that one can give reviews of each temple in this park but that is too time-consuming and while some temples definitely are must-sees, others can be fun to just wander around in. Although I read up on this place before we left on our trip, I was still stunned at what a huge area it covers...it can be overwhelming. We only had two days to visit with our Tour Group and one day on our own. We would have liked to have spent a minimum of a week to be able to tour things more closely and see more temples. On our first day the tour took us to Ta Phrom (the Jungle Temple - trees growing over the ruins) and then Banteay Srei (elaborate red sandstone carvings), both very different from each other. On the second day we visited Angkor Wat (got there at 5:45 a.m. to watch the sunrise...hint if you do this on your own...try to sit on the inside of the outer wall for a great view...you are above the people on the ground and get better photos, too) and saw all the amazing bas-relief carvings in some of the galleries. Later we visited Angkor Thom but mostly concentrated on Bayon (with all its smiling faces). The day on our own we visited Preah Khan - hired a tuk-tuk to take us out and bring us back. There were so many other temples we would have loved to see but no time. Things to keep in mind...you MUST have a pass to enter the park and visit the temples...they take your photograph for the pass (line moves quickly). You can get a 1 day, 3 day, or 7 day pass (we had a 3 day one $40).Also the park is located quite a distance from Siem Reap and there is a lot of traffic. And it can take time to get from one temple to another so don't plan on seeing a lot of temples in one day."

We had the whole complex to ourselves (just one other couple) for a good 20 minutes of so. It was great to be able to explore without any around! On thing of note, the stairs up the main temple do not open until 7:45am, but I man is standing there saying you can go up for $5. If I had to do this over: Day 1: Do sunrise at Angkor Wat (but go in instead of waiting for the sunrise. Then go to Bayon, and then Ta Thom. All of them were amazing. So different and each unique. We did not have to deal with crowds at all - and were back to our hotel room by 10am. Day 2: We went to Koh Ker and beng Meala. Both were impressive, and a taxi to both cost us $100. Both were great, unique places to see. (Note, both have separate passes, your angkor pass does not work at either). Day 3: Do the Roulus group in the morning (takes about two hours). Go see Bantrei Srei and the Landmine Museum in the afternoon. Things we did that were missable:- The large circuit. The temples became \"same, same but different.\" Nothing really unique about them. -Kbal Spleen: It's okay for a hike and to get away from the city. The carvings aren't that great. - DO NOT WASTE your time/money at the National Museum. Totally overpriced and underwhelming."

You can visit by bicycle, tuk tuk, taxi or organised tour. If you have the energy and time it is lovely cycling around and looking at it all at your own pace. Early morning is a good time to visit before the crowds. Angkor Wat itself gets very busy, but the large tour groups tend to go back to town for lunch, so this can be a quiet, if a bit hotter, time to visit. The restaurants at the front of Angkor Wat are nice and cheap and a good place for a rest and toilet stop. If you really went hard you could see a lot of this area in one big day, but much nicer to spread it out over a few and really enjoy it. Once you get your entry ticket you are free to visit your choice of temples at your leisure. I would recommend a guide for your initial visit as you will learn and be shown things you otherwise wouldn't see or know. Ta Phrom is quite small and gets really busy so I would plan this one for a very early. There are some less known and less visited temples in the park that are much less visited and worth a look too. You will never forget your visit to Angkor so make the most of it."

Allow at least 3 days for this amazing complex of temples, and hire your own tuk-tuk to take you around, as the distance to some temples is considerable. A 3-day pass can be used over any 3 days within a week. Start early in the morning to avoid the heat and crowds, drink lots of water, take a hat and please don't give sweets to children begging or selling postcards. Their parents can't afford to take them to the dentist!"

Some sites are being left in the same state as when they were rediscovered. Others have been restored with the help of various universities, governments and other agencies from around the world.

There were many many tourists and many many hawkers but that did not take away at all from the wonderful day seeing amazing ancient temples. The highlight was when a women gently took me into an alcove of the main temple in Ankor Wat and gave me incense and showed me how to bow to the shrine. There was another gentle movement toward a donation box. Once I placed a dollar in there she placed a cotton friendship band on my wrist and wished me long life. I still wear it 6 mths later and remember that experience with fondness."

The park itself is huge with so many temples spread out that you could easily spend a week there and still be seeing something new. You need a driver, we used a tuk tuk for the four days we were there (a man called Mr Smeeth - thoroughly recommend him) and we found that the going rate was $15 for half a day and $25 for a full day, with an additional $15 if you want to visit sites out of the park (this covers the extra fuel / time etc). The other thing you need is patience, don't try to do too much, pace yourself - especially pertinent if you are after good photos as you need to frame your shot then wait for the crowds to clear. We went in the rainy season and found that it was fine in the morning but stormed for an hour or so around 3pm, we quite liked this as it cooled off substantially after the rain (bring a rain coat and a plastic bag for your camera). The other benefit is lower crowds, but this is balanced with a lack of spectacular sunsets as there is a lot of cloud."

I paid $40 for 3 days pass and worth it.

It was super fun! Combining between adventures and exercise. The temples I like most are Banteay Srei and Banteay Samre. So when I visited those temples in the morning of my last day in Siem Reap, I feel like getting big surprises. It was beautifully standing there under the sun ray...full of details, feminine, compared to another temples in both Small and Grand Circuit.I did love biking there because the park is surrounded by trees, jungles and has flat track. The only challenge was a very hot-humid weather... It felt like 40\u00b0C..a free sauna!Overall, it is a great place to be explored..."

Monkeys - I didn't know you pass groups of wild monkeys on the way to the temples. Buy some bananas and take them with you and ask your driver to stop so you can feed them. They are very cute and will take the banana from your hand.3. Elephants - I also didn't know that there are 3 points in the park where you can get an elephant ride for between US$15 and US$20.4. Do yourself a favour and go to the Museum and do the audio headphones self guided tour for US$15 the day before you go to the park.

It is like stepping back in time.I like this more than the other temples because it's not too huge to go take a look around every inch but at the same time, not too small to get bored. Somehow Bayon is more personalized in such a way that you get to explore tunnels and be surrounded by huge smiling heads that are just breathtakingly spectacular. You are up close and being just next to them - words cannot explain. The visitors here are not as packed as Angkor Wat, hence you get more time for yourself. :)Choosing a great tuktuk driver as well can either enhance or make your trip really bad. I recommend Pech Vanny. Search for him in facebook :)))"

The complex is absolutely amazing and if you want to do all of the temples you will have to stay for weeks. The temples are quite huge and if you want to see it all and explore it takes time. I would recommend a guide to tell you about the temple and its history as it will increase your experience. It is also busy, lots of tourists and its hot and dusty but that is to be expected in a tropical country Just prepare yourself, do half-day tours, bring plenty of water, take breaks, sunscreen, snacks etc. The temples themselves are just amazing, there is no other way to describe it. The amount of buildings, the detail, the construction of them... it is so hard to fathom the amazing culture that is behind it all. To stand in the middle off it all and just look around and try to take it all in, its hard to describe. You can get 1, 3 or 6 day passes. You have to go in on consecutive days and the prices are $20 (1 day), $40 (3 days) and $60 (6 days)."

Everyone\u2019s different \u2013 some can spend days checking every nook and cranny, while others only need a walk through. It didn\u2019t matter \u2013 it\u2019s $20/day or $40 for 3 days, so I didn\u2019t lose money by only using 2 days of my pass.I went the day before at 5pm to get my pass, having been advised via other reviews that the entrance can be a zoo in the mornings. It took 3 minutes to get my pass at 5pm (you are also granted free access for sunset if you go at this time), and the next morning there was almost nobody at the entrance. I think this is luck of the draw though.I paid my driver $15 per day (as advised by my hostel) and tipped him $2 each day. He was more than happy with this. He picked me up both days at 7am and I was finished by about noon each day. I really liked having a tuk tuk. After the intense heat of walking around the temples, it was nice to sit in the back and feel the breeze as we drove to the next one. In a car, the AC wouldn\u2019t be cold until you are already at the next stop.I didn\u2019t have a guide. I felt it would hold me back. I\u2019m much more visual than audio, so listening to someone talk was not for me. I did my research before I came and kept my notes with me.It is so incredibly hot, even early in the morning, I was going through a bottle of water an hour, and I\u2019m a small person. So definitely be prepared for that. Also note that some temples require climbing. Some are easy, but some are downright intimidating because they are so high.At Angkor Wat, you can go on the grounds of the temple, but you cannot climb the main temple if you are dressed inappropriately. I was wearing a t-shirt and loose fitting capris and was allowed in but asked to remove my hat. Baphuon won\u2019t let you in at all if you are dressed inappropriately. I was not allowed as I was wearing shorts on my 2nd day.Pictures do not do this place justice. Nor do they give any real concept of just how big these stunning temples are. Regardless of your exploring style, I can\u2019t say anything others haven\u2019t already said \u2013 it\u2019s just incredible."

I would recommend several things - go to see the main temple 1st thing in the morning. It is incredibly hot(110 degrees) and the heat will take every ounce of energy out of you. Bring sun screen(50+), plenty of water and wear a sun hat. Wear cotton or linen clothes or those wicking fabrics. . . . take plenty of breaks and carry an umbrella for the sun. I had a small portable $4.00 one and it was a lifesaver. I also bought a fan from a vendor which really helped.

Once you\u2019ve seen the photos of the forest slowly overtaking the ruins, it\u2019s hard to not want to spend some time here.Being a history/religion and architecture enthusiast I was excited to have the time to visit Angkor Archaeological Park. My personal thought is to hire a Tuk Tuk for the day, for about 3-days, and travel from Wat to Wat. Having your personal Tuk Tuk will help you when wanting to enter from one side of a temple and exit from the other side, plus it does not hurt to have some insider knowledge.There was one out of our three days we decided to do a lot of walking and found that it gets annoying when drivers are hassling you to take their Tuk Tuk for $2 - $4 one way. You also have the option to have a car drive you around, but it is not the same feeling as an open air Tuk Tuk that does not go too fast.One great experience was hand feeding wild monkeys!!! We had passed a lady who follows them around while selling bananas... so we stopped and bought some and gathered some amazing footage with our cameras. BUT, be cautious of leaving your items on the Tuk Tuk, a monkey might go through them or take them.We had visited a month after the Angkor Wat International Half Marathon, which runs right through the famous ruins. The race markers were still out and this helped grasp the size of this place.There are plenty of places to eat and buy beverages while in the park. We relied on our Tuk Tuk driver to take us to some good eats where not many people were at... again this is a plus for having your own Tuk Tuk driver. By the way, you can find any Tuk Tuk driver in town to do this for you, or your hotel can set it up. If your hotel offers it, take it so you get someone who will not short you of time by rushing you. They are very trust worthy and only cost about $20 for the entire day.Low cost service for a great experience. Well worth it!!! You can pay $20 for a day pass, or $40 for a 3 day pass. Afterwards I was very thankful we chose the 3-day because of everything you can do"

Day 2 return with a Tuk Tuk and see some lesser sights on your own. Don't under estimate the heat, it will slow you down. If you are determined to see as many temples as possible, take note. Waking up for an Angkor Sunrise and walking up lots of steep monuments soon takes it toll. Luckily there are two famous routes around the sites. A map in a free Siem Reap guide you can pick up hotels shows a red \"short tour\" circuit, and a green \"grand tour\". Drivers may be familiar with these.

Two of us rented bicycles whereas the other 3 hired a Tuk Tuk driver for the day. However, the tuk tuk drivers are a bit temperamental and wanted to know exact times. Bicycles is a great way to get around and less restrictive. We saw 13 temples in one day by bicycle and cycled 50km. We arrived at the park at 9.30 and stayed until 6pm to watch the sunset At pre rup. Pre rup is a beautiful temple but if you want to Get decent pictures, go about 3pm when it is quiet then return again at 5.30 for the sunset. the sunset there is beautiful but Very busy so any temple pictures are ruined by thousands of tourists. Also Ta Phrom is ridiculously busy with Korean and Chinese tourists that are obsessed with the fact that Angelina Jolie stood in a certain spot, so pictures there are ruined by hundreds of tourists also. We only had a day pass so we tried to cram in as much as possible. Obviously a 3 day pass would be better if you had enough time in your holiday."

It was so hot and humid that we had to take several breaks in between the tour throughout the day. Nonetheless, the temples were amazing, beyond words can describe. Dress comfortably and light; a dry fit t-shirt and a pair of bermuda or cotton leggings is perfect. My husband and I engaged a guide and a driver, cost us USD65 but it was money well spent. I would recommend getting a guide as the place is huge and extremely rich in history. Moreover, the guide knows how to avoid the tour crowds and most importantly, as I was nursing an upset stomach, the guide is able to locate a toilet for me whenever I need to answer nature's call. We bought the 3 day pass which cost USD40 and it includes entrance to the remote temples like Banteay Srey and Kbal Spean which we visited the next day. As there are too many temples, I have listed down a few temples which I personally recommend - Angkor Wat, Bayon, Baphoun, Terrace of the Leper King, Terrance of the Elephants, Ta Prohm, Ta Keo, Banteay Kdei, Banteay Srey and Kbal Spean. If you have some extra time (day trip), please visit Preah Vihear temple! It is not within Angkor Archaeological Park and it is 3 hours drive away from Siem Reap town. This temple is my personal favourite. It is located on top of a mountain and the view from the cliff at the end of the temple is beautiful."

On the way to Angkor wat is lush lined trees which give relaxing feeling to visitors. Exploring the temple in early morning is a good idea to avoid the stunning heat in the midday sun.

Sunset at Bahkeng was nice but the amount of people with cameras waiting for the good shot, steeping on each others head just shocked us, so be prepare for it.

Certainly one of the places you needed to see before you die.I bought a one-day pass and managed to cover Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Prohm, Banteay Srei. I hired an English-speaking Cambodian tour guide for USD15 at Angkor Wat and it was worth it. The guy was very well-versed with the history and friendly. He also insisted that we hired him at Angkor Wat so that when we traveled to other temples, we don't need any guidance since the story behind the wats are pretty much the same.Nevertheless, at one of the temples, we got conned by a fake tour guide who insisted on following us throughout our time at one of the temples (even though we did not ask for him), telling us bits of information and then asked us to tip him USD15 also. We only paid USD5. So be careful if you go to other temples, nothing comes free and stick to official tour guides. We also noticed another fake tour guide trying to approach us at Bayon and we quickly ran away.Do travel with tuk-tuks in this park, it's more enjoyable. Equip yourself with light clothing, comfortable shoes for climbing and walking, drinking water, hat, sunglasses and sunscreen."

Although I have to say that there is more to the Park than the Big and Small circuits, as some of the best temples are outside the beaten path. Be prepared! Climbing the scary steep steps of Angkor is not for the faint of heart and legs. Temperatures can soar and before you know it, your shirt is soaked in sweat. The sun is fierce and unforgiving and will burn unprotected skin. But for those who are prepared the views from the top of these temple-mountains are stunning, the scale and layout of the temples astounding and overwhelming, the sculptures are so unbelievable that you will pick your jaw from the floor, and the Cambodian people, the proud inheritors of this gigantic heritage, a happy and beautiful people with ready smiles.History buffs would find the Angkor Archaeological Park a dream come true - temple after temple stretching deep into the dense woodland, each with a story, most surrounded by a moat or even a giant reservoir or, in Khmer, a baray, which makes them even more interesting. The temples are in varying states of decay - some are superbly preserved like Angkor Wat and Banteay Samre, while some are pretty ruined like the Baphuon. A seven-day pass for 60 USD will probably be your best option. Mix it with a tour of distant Angkorian sites like Prasat Preah Vihear and Koh Ker and your Angkor experience would be complete.A definite must see!"

My wife and I got the three day pass and covered the small and grand circuits, plus kbal spean and banteay srei. We also went to the land mine museum, Phnom Kulen and Beng Mealea (all great experiences as well, though Kulen is admittedly pricey for what you get to see - 20 bucks a person; though the cooling swimming hole/waterfall was a welcome respite). Was just great fun and a great history/art lesson at every turn. Highly recommend biking at least a portion of the small circuit, if not all of it. Biking the wall of Angkor Thom was a real highlight, as we were alone (minus the monkeys!) the entire time. Angkor Wat at dawn was another great sight, as were the other usual suspects: the Bayon, Ta Prohm, Preah Khan, Bakheng, Baphuon (this one more for the view at the top). Though there were a lot of people as always, we did find plenty of quiet spots given the size of the place. We even had a whole small temple (Ta Nei) to ourselves at one point. It was down a dirt road quite a bit, but was very cool to find this secluded spot at the end of it. So glad we were able to visit this great complex. And, as mentioned in the subject, our driver was one of the reasons why our visit was so enjoyable. Sochet was prompt, knowledgeable, spoke english very well (and he's self-taught!) and made us feel so welcome in his country, showing us around the countryside as we went. I'd recommend anyone looking to book someone trustworthy and affordable in advance to visit his website: http://www.driveangkor.com/home.html. Thanks again Sochet!"

I did the Angkor Wat complex and Angkor Thom complex in a full day, minor outside temples in one more day with the amazing sunrise in Angkor wat in a second visit plus Prasat Banteay Srei (my very best one), and river carvings (a very nice trekking in the forest to reach it) plus other marginal beautiful ones on the third visit.

The first stop will be the Angkor Wat. I was honestly dissapointed. In reality there is a lot of glare and dust in Cambodia. There were hundreds of other tourists. If you aren't massive on history then give going inside a miss. There was nothing to see but stone and sweating hoards of people. Our first enjoyable move was to grab an Angkor beer each and continue on with our tuk tuk. The other temples were much less crowded and enjoyable. We got to the park around 10am so perhaps try and get there on opening time if you enjoy photography and want to beat the crowds (if that's even possible). I loved Ta Prohm. The tree roots are spectacular. All in all once you get past the discomfort of the bustle and heat, the park will leave you with some incredible photos of the temples."

The guides are required to dress in a uniform, so you will know if they are a licensed guide (probably you will need to book in advance). Be forewarned: there is extreme poverty here so the hawkers are quite forceful. I've been to a lot of tourist places and I was still caught off guard the first day. The way nature interacts with the ruins is quite unlike anything I've ever seen, and the variety is quite impressive.

I understand that they are trying to make a living in a competitive environment but I did feel stressed at being harassed every time I arrived or left a temple location.

We researched some brief history of the different temple before we went Siem Reap for Angkor Wat and other temples around it. A great place for photos. If you are not a person who is interested in history/temples, 1 day may be just enough for you. If you would like to know more about the place and history, get the 2 to 3 days pass because the place is huge. =) weather is surprising cold in the day in January this year. Tuk Tuk is a great way to get around (and cheaper too), if you are not afraid of dust. Very great experience in tuk tuk, LOVE IT!"

We cycled round to another entrance and had to go 6k back on ourselves to find the ticket office. We should have took the turning with the white board.Once getting our passes and getting into the park, the sights and ruins were mind blowing. It has to be seen to be believed. We cycled around the park for about 5 hours using a map and following signs around the bike. It is very easy to do and the park is flat.

            "review": "Amazing, Absolutely Amazing. Most visitors in Siem Reap are here to see the gorgeous temples in Angkor Park. You can buy a one day ticket which can actually be purchased at sunset one night to view the sunset then includes the whole next day. There are also 3 day, 7 day, and more passes. As people who were excited to see the temples, are very interested in history, and love exploring, we found the 3 day pass to be enough for us. There are people who will tell you a week isnt even enough but those are extreme temple enthusiasts as many people find that the temples can all start to look alike after a day or two (or even a few hours for some) if you are not extremely into their history and meaning. I recommend taking advantage of sunrises and sunsets as often as possible as they are the most beautiful, cool, and least crowded. There is a sense of calm and solitude at the temples during these times and the large tour buses are not present.The pass you buy will have your picture on it and they are checked regularly at the temples so do not buy tickets from anyone on the streets - they are frauds.There are an absolute ton of drivers to choose from; their prices are all pretty comparable; and they do basically the same routes around the temples. You can find a driver through your hotel, in town or at the temples and agree on a price and route for the day. Some people find a driver online and book in advance but most wait until they arrive. I was unsure which to do but we waited and had no issues. Guides and drivers are separate individuals and costs for guides/tours vary quite a bit based on group size, company, and transport used (tuktuk, aircon car). I found many people who loved their guides but others who would rather have roamed the temples on their own. We decided to use a guidebook and driver and found this worked well for us. Prior to our visit we ordered Ancient Angkor (Freeman & Jacques) and found it to be insightful and useful. We read some in advance but having our own driver also allowed us the flexibility to find some shade at each stop and read about the temple while we were there. My husband also downloaded some podcasts/ebooks that he listened to while at the temples. He also found that downloading and doing some guided meditation at the temples during sunrise/sunset was very soothing - we really enjoyed it during the calm times we found at the temples."

The first tip i would give for anyone who wish to visit the temples is to wake up early everyday... even if you do not go for a sunrise as it gets really crowded and hot during the day.We had a strategy for the visit that we believe made us maximize the experience for the 3 day access. First, get a TukTuk driver that is willing to be flexible and allow you to adapt the order of temples you wsh to visit. We always woke up early, but we actually never went for the famous sunrise at Angor Wat temple. Instead, we beat the crowd and while everyone who woke early went for that temple, we went for Ta Prohm and Bayon in the first two days... And we were practically alone in these temples... This magnify the experience by a factor.Why we did not go for Angor Wat sunrise, we thought it is very touristy, hard to get a spot for a good view. The fact that everyone goes for that temple actually went to our advantage.Our itinary:1st day: departure at 5h00 Sras Srang, Banteay Kdei, Ta Prohm, Ta Keo and East Mebon Return to hotel at 11h2nd day: departure at 5h30 Anghor Thom (all the complex, starting by Bayon) Anghor Wat Return to hotel at 13h3rd day: Departure at 6h30 Preah Khan, Neak Poan, Ta Som, Banteay Samre Return to hotel at 11h30We generally paid our tuk tuk driver 20$ for each day, except the last where we paid 25$ since we had a temple more distant (plus a dollar in tip each day).Note. We enjoyed a bit less Anghor Wat in comparison to other temples. We felt that Anghor Wat felt more like a palace or a cathedral rather than archeological ruin. It is a matter of taste, i liked it more when the temples are lost in the jungle. There is however a good National Geographic documentary that can be found on you-tube that provide a lot of neat history on that temple. It is nice to see it before the visit,Overall, This site is a must see in Cambodia."

I'm not at all spiritual so perhaps that's to do with it as many comments seem to imply spirituality or something like that, which I don't believe in. I did find the tourist park set-out less than fascinating, but realistically it's undoubtedly hideously expensive to maintain the ruins and millions want to see it all, so that's simply the way it is. I had no desire to see the sun come up there and still don't. I'm not saying it's not interesting, and impressive, Bayon Temple especially, but it's a theme park now; just a real one rather than an invention. I imagine those who want to spend a week there live on a different planet than I do; which is fine, I also imagine we don't want to visit each other much.

            "review": "How to avoid the big bus tours. The temples of Angkor are definitely a once in a lifetime experience. I felt this way 20 years ago on my first visit and it is still true today. That said, today (20 years later), the chaos, loud talking from the various tour groups competing to be heard, and the sheer number of tourists can detract significantly from the experience. Every neighboring Asian country must have been represented in these big bus tour groups. Many of these tour groups tend to be loud, disrespectful, and create a circus-like atmosphere. Although it is impossible to totally avoid the crowds and big bus tours, here are some tips that will help:1) Hire a good local tour guide and driver. They will know what times to visit and what areas of the temples to take you so that you will have some peace and quiet to enjoy the temples. Make sure you tell the guide that you would like to avoid the worst of the big bus tours. They will know what you mean as these tours have taken over the temples.2) Avoid visiting at peak tour hours. Some notorious times to avoid are: Angkor Wat at sunrise, Phnon Bakheng at sunset, Bayon immediately after sunrise, and Ta Prohm during mid to late morning.3) Get a three day pass so that you can pick a few temples each day, visiting at off-peak hours. We visited Bayon at sunset and did not see one big bus tour group. We visited Ta Phrom at 7am and managed to get an hour of peace before the tour groups arrived.4) Get your pass the evening before your visit at 5pm. In the morning, the ticketing area is, literally, a zoo of big bus tour groups.5) Visit some of the less popular temples. The big bus tours often do the same circuit of Angkor Wat at sunrise, Bayon, Ta Prohm, Preah Khan, Banteay Srey, and Phnom Bakheng or Angkor Wat at sunset.6) Many temples have multiple entrances. Have your tour guide take you to the entrance with the fewest tour buses.7) When you see a tour group coming, head in the opposite direction. Getting caught in the middle of a group makes it impossible to enjoy the temples.8) Instead of waiting in a long line to climb the steps of Angkor Wat, try climbing Pre Rep instead. We passed by this temple on three different occasions and it was never overwhelmed with tourists.We give a solid 5 stars for the temples because they are truly magnificent and worth the trip. The masses of big bus tour groups cannot be avoided and they do detract from the experience. However, you can still take some measures to circumvent the worst of it and be able to appreciate the experience of being at the temples."

You'll find a million tuk tuk's vying for your business at the airport, bus station, and hotels. I've used the same driver for my 3 visits, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend him.

We've been planning to see the complex for years and we're very happy that we finally did. We didn't hire a tour guide because we like to discover things as we go, but should you wish to do the same, it's best to read a bit about the temples, or visit the National museum first.There's plenty of reasons to visit: look at ancient architecture, wait for the sunrise, wait for the sunset, learn of different cultures, or visit the place where Tomb Riader was filmed. Whatever tickles your fancy, this is such a wonderful place.This was a new experience indeed for one to be able to walk through halls, that were built by ancient civilizations. To be able to walk along the halls that's nearly 2 millenias old is truly fascinating, The craftsmanship is also crazy! Just imagining how people were able to build such places is difficult. So much has been said about Angkor, yet no matter how good the pictures are, how well the words have been written, nothing beats being there share the experience with so many people.Do bring the following:1. Water - it gets quite hot during the day. And when you're inside Angkor Wat or Angkor Thom, the stores where you can buy can be quite far.2. Comfortable shoes3. Light clothing - do wear t-shirts, and avoid anything without sleeves. Also wear shorts that go beyond the knee pr buy those pants in the markets. Temples are sacred places so dress modestly.4. SunglassesLots of temples have steep stairs, so prepare your legs.I did find a lot of tourists talking really loud. As much as these are \"attractions\" they are still places of worship."

Each and every one of the temples is unique and with its own quirks (although go to enough of them and they'll start to blur in your mind), and you could spend hours at each one just going over over nook and cranny. Our highlight was going off the busier paths and coming across some smaller temples our driver hadn't told us about.Sadly it can be busy - head into the temples rather than watch Angkor Wat's sunrise if you want isolation, or be prepared for tourists in your photos because its a very popular place to visit.

I would say he was right. Later in the same city I ran into a guy giving me a schedule of exact times to be at exact locations, I didn't write anything down and did go about it my own way.Many say you should see the sun rise, myself I didn't, did not simply see the meaning of it. There is always a certain length you will go to get the perfect photos for your album and I concluded that to be to far.Depending on how big your company is there is a few ways of doing this. That guy with the schedule said to go by bike and that was what I decided for, many seems to do. A little pointer though where my MTB was excellent for 90% of the visit, it was also horrible for the rainy last 10% if you get what I mean. But bigger groups may choose tuctuc instead, I guess there is a breaking point where that will be cheaper than bikes. The bike though is a peaceful way of just biking around the temple ruins.While the Angkor Wat is the best kept and most known, I actually thought many of the others gave me more, but that's maybe just me.The only downside of the visit was two things, at Angkor Thom this ticket controller tried to hook me up with a tour to some other temple the next day, I got a fishy feeling about this guy especially as he asked where I'd parked my bike. The second thing was in one of the last temples I ran into this duo of tourist policemen that threw a guide tour on me in the temple, as i was western and their uniform said police I was taking a little by surprise as he wanted a \"donation\" upon finish. He sad I didn't need to pay, which I didn't. It left me though with a creepy feeling and ruined my exploration of this specific ruin."

Angkor Wat alone is just stunning, particularly knowing the age of the place and the fact that it was all built using plain manpower, including vast water courses and lakes. Then there is Angkor Thom and Ta Prohm plus several easily accessible smaller temples. We had a guide and an aircon car for two 5-hour morning stints, starting fairly early in the morning to beat the crowds, and this proved a great option, better than one long day. You could rapidly get exhausted with the walking if you don't have motorised transport between the sites. For those younger and fitter than us, bicycles might be an option. We were impressed that the site is now well controlled and policed such that the risk of damage from tourists is minimised to some extent."

Having the private tuk tuk allowed us to be efficient in our visits -- our guide phoned the driver as we were readying to leave one temple, and the driver picked us up exactly as we walked out to whisk us off to the next temple site or to lunch.The Angkor complex is spread over several areas.

I recommend the tuktuk but you can also rent a bike for 2-3dollars for a day which is also find. One thing to note is that if you buy your ticket after 5 o clock for the next day you get a free sunset the day of the purchase of the ticket. But make sure the entrance guy doesnt stamp you ticket on that day since you will need it for the next day.I would discourage people from going to the angkor what in the early afternoon as the sun was on the other side of the temple and there where not that may good opportunities for pictures. I ended up going back in the evening to get better photos. Also take advantage of the small temples. Most people only go to the main temples and the main temples can get really packed while the small ones you can have them to yourself, literally (When i went to the minor temples there was no one). The entrance fee is 20 for one day 40 for three and 60 for the one week pass. There also is extra fee for some temples such as the Phnom Kulen ( USD 20 ), Koh Ker ( USD 10 ) and Beng Mealea ( USD 5 )."

I understand that the temples bring incredible benefits to SR and the Cambodian community, but they will soon only be a pile of rubble. Having said that I noted the restoration being undertaken, and adding new heads onto old stone sculptures is not something that is very eye appealing. If you want to visit the temples go late in the afternoon when everyone has climbed the mountain for the sunset.

Reclaimed from the jungle, they offer an amazing insight into the history of the Khmer kings and the Hindu and Buddhist religions.Angkor Wat is incredibly impressive, as is Angkor Thom. Elaborate and wonderfullly preserved bas-reliefs depict Hindu mythology and historical battles with the Cham. Angkor Thom's wonderful Elephant Terrace is massive and Ta Phrom boasts the roots of enormous strangler figs engulfing the walls. Hundreds of tourists flock to Anghor Wat at sun-rise and Phrom Bakheng is a favourite for watching the sun set. We enjoyed the sun-rise from the other side of the moat at Angkor Wat, with only a handful of others, which made for a very pleasant experience. We then visited this magnificent temple as people disgorged from its gates in search of breakfast, so were able to climb to the top levels and study the incredible bas-reliefs before the next wave of tour buses arrived about 9 am.Some of the smaller temples are in a poorer state of repair, but are incredibly atmospheric. Sanskrit carved into the walls and columns gives historians detailed accounts of the background and purpose of these wonderful temples.January is a great time to visit at the the temperatures are moderate and the weather is dry. Allow a few days so you can visit the more popular temples at quieter times of the day. A 3-day pass can be purchased for the same price as a 2-day pass."

Work out where the sun will be rising and position yourself accordingly, if you want photos of the sun rising behind the temples. Take a folding chair - you'll be waiting from 530 until about 7.I'd recommend a guide, but make sure s/he speaks good English (if that is your best language!). I couldn't understand quite a bit of what our guide said.Finally, if you can afford it, get a driver with a car, not a tuktuk - for $30/day, it's great to sit back in aircon with a cold bottle of water and recuperate from a few hours wandering about in the heat and dust, gearing up for the next temple."

Note to prospective tourists: While the sites itself are enough to take your breath away, I would recommend you to make some researches of its history (or get a tour guide) to truly understand its greatness. You will need at least 3 days at the very least to complete the whole tour. However, a day would be suffice for visiting only the major ones. Personally, I don't think it's entirely necessary to visit every single site in there unless you are really into it because most, if not all, of them looks very similar to each other. A tuk-tuk is a must. Can't travel by foot. Bicycle could be possible if you're \"very\" fit."

Along the way we had a flat tyre, asked a police officer for help, and he start instantly fixing the tyre in 10 minutes!!

            "review": "A must-add to your bucket list. Angkor isn't just the Angkor Wat. It's actually the remains of an ancient city, the former seat of the once-mighty Khmer Empire, so spending more than a day visiting the sites is recommended. For our visit, we took a two-day tour and covered most of the Small & Grand Circuit. Hiring a good guide is recommended. Sure, you can DIY using bikes or hiring just a driver but you'll miss a lot of details and nuances on the history and context of the place. Aside from interacting with a local, you won't get lost in the passageways or take the wrong exit and cannot find your driver or your bike. If you don't have a budget for a guide, make sure you have a good Angkor guide book to help you decode the sculptures, murals, bas reliefs and numerous symbolisms in this culturally-rich UNESCO World Heritage site. Without someone to tell you the story behind the ruins, it will all look like a pile of rubble after a while.Since we opted for a tour, we didn't get to haggle on what tut-tuk tour fares should be. Check other reviewers for the ongoing rates or if you want to save yourself the hassle, book directly at the numerous Siem Reap tuk-tuk tours on the Internet. You can DIY using bikes (provided free by some guesthouses) but it can be a hassle at some temples since they don't allow bikes inside. You'll have to backtrack the temple, going back to where you came in, which means losing time exploring the other sites.Traveling by tuk-tuk is the way to go, but for farther sites like Banteay Srei, hiring a car is a better and quicker option.Siem Reap can be hot and humid and you'll obviously want to wear shorts. But ask a local (your guide or your driver) first if there are any dress restrictions in the temple you're going. Some are actual places of worship, so females are required to wear pants or long dresses when climbing the Angkor Wat and Phnom Bakheng. A female tourist in front of us was asked to cover up her tank top before entering Phnom Bakheng. A shawl or scarf can do the trick.Bring water. As mentioned, Siem Reap is in a tropical climate so you'll get thirsty. Most guides and drivers provide complimentary water, but if you're DIY, don't forget it or you'll be shelling out US dollars to buy from the numerous vendors that surround the temple. There are also restaurants in the Angkor Wat, Sra Srang and other temples that range from roadside vendors to street side eatery style to full-on package tour restaurants, if you get hungry. There's a Blue Pumpkin outlet near Angkor Wat but we didn't get to see it.Restrooms are placed on the road leading to the temples, not on the ruins themselves. So keep an eye out for them since you don't want to get caught doing the deed on the ruins. It's free of use when you have your Angkor Pass.If you're still in the process of considering a trip to Angkor, be ready to climb steep stairs (going down is also a real challenge). Sure, you can skip it but you'll miss a lot of the ruins and the majestic view. There's also a lot of walking from entrance to exit and in between temples on dusty (muddy, if it's raining) paths. So if you're bringing over young children, the elderly and the disabled, it can be quite challenging.Still, a visit to Angkor is very much worth it. In fact, every person on Earth should visit this majestic site at least once in their lifetime."

The traffic from Siem Reap is heard to believe so try to get a very early start or stay until dusk when the crowds dwindle. We saw so many structures in a two day period of time, it would have been difficult without the assistance. Historically, artistically and culturally rich, be sure to \"read\" some of the scenes carved into the sandstone depicting the actual events of the time. There are many steps most uneven and some slippery, wear comfortable shoes and watch your step.

Our driver was very nice and we were fine paying a bit more, plus there were four of us.Tickets are available as of 5am. You can buy one day pass for $20, or three day pass for $40. Bring dollars. In riels, it cost 82,000, which is more than $20 by 2,000 rl, or about half a dollar.Have I mentioned that dollar - EUR exchange rate does not have anything to do with the world exchange rate for that day? When I visited Cambodia, dollar - EUR rate was: 1: 0.73. The rate in Cambodia was 1:0.90. Do the math. Bring dollars and only dollars, and change some dollars to KHR, since you may get better prices at some local places if you pay riels.ANGKOR WAT for sunrise? Why on Earth is this in every book you can find about visiting Angkor? Guys, it is absolutely nothing special. We had clear sky, not a single cloud, and it was not colorful. It was nothing special, really. We started our trip at 5am in the morning just because of this, and it was so NOT worth it! Hundreds, if not thousands, of tourists come to Angkor Wat in the morning because they have read that sunrise there is magical. Please, go some place else in Angkor for sunrise, and you will have the place almost for yourself, since everyone is at Angkor. 1. My favorite place was BAYON.. It has special energy. Many people I spoke to felt the same. This place just makes you want to stay there for hours and absorb amazing energy that it has. I wish I came to this place for sunrise, and had it for myself.2. ANGKOR THOM - right next to Bayon.3. TA PROHM - east of Angkor Thom. Amazing place. This is the place where huge trees intertwine with the buildings. Looks nicer earlier in the morning.4. PREAH KHAN - north of Angkor Thom. Haven't seen this one, but it is so possible to add it to the 1 day visit list.5. Start heading back to ANGKOR WAT. In the afternoon is great because of the position of the sun, and you can make great pictures then. I saw many Buddhist monks meditating here, so, if you are into meditation, this could be the place to plan this. But, you will end up in the photographs of many visitors while meditating. As did the monks.6. Sunset? No idea where. Bayon again? Or PHNOM BAKHENG hill, which is recommended for sunset. Expect many tourists at sunset. Or visit it during the day.Also, who says that it is very difficult to do the tour ON BIKE because it is far? From the city center, there is about 6km to Angkor. Does this sound to you like impossible or strenuous? Tuk tuk is nice, but then - you have to make your list in advance or you would be charged extra or the driver would tell you that there is no time to go back, or you would feel bad for the driver waiting for you, so sometimes you would hurry, and change your plans because of that. And bikes - many guesthouses give them for free. Next time I would definitely try the bike. Yes, if I go back to Cambodia, Angkor is so amazing that it is worth visiting again."

The word is out though, so there are a huge amount of tourist here everyday. Now that does not mean that you will aways be jumbled in. You can go early and hit some of the lesser temples, and there might be no one there at all. You do need to go early to beat the heat, and the aircondioned tourist buses that show up around 10 am. This complex includes Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Bayon, and many more. Take your time with it.You can get 1, 3, and 7 days passes. We got the three day and it worked out perfectly. At the park entrance they take a picture of you, get your passport info, and then print out a photo id for you to use. I recommend getting a good guide and a tuktuk, because there is so much to learn. I rented a bike on my third day which was exciting, hot, but not too hard. You just need to hydrate. Its a great way to see it at your own pace, and since I used guides my first two days, I went to my favorite places.

Highlight: Prasat Pre Roup (Just another temple... ok, but something that made it sticks in my mind. I think it was the atmosphere. This was the first station. We reached here about 9am. The sky was so blue and the wind was chilly, and the sunshine coated the whole temple in a mysterious golden glow. We took alot of photos here.), Kbal Spean (We came here without any reading about the place. We hiked a long way, and found ourselves a small stream at the end of the hike, we were quite disappointed.. but hey, we found something carved on the stones along the riverbank, and more and more when we walked down the stream. We were so excited. It was a unique spot, something different from all the other temples. Expect a quite strenuous hike though, bring a lot of drinking water!), The country side (We were glad that we chose tuk-tuk, because we could experience the beautiful country side with more senses: smell of sugar palm syrup when we passed some stores along the road side, smell of cow dung, the chilly wind, the dog bark and bird chipping. But make sure you prepare a mask for yourself, some part of the road could be very dusty)Third day, we decided not to go to other small temples, but we revisited Angkor Wat and Bayon with bicycle. It was a relaxing tour, as we were not rushing to anywhere. We stopped by random encounters with local food sellers, and a wedding ceremony in a temple in the town. We decided to revisit to Angkor Wat and Bayon, to try our luck for a better weather to shoot better photos. Well, the weather turned out better than the first day. During the revisit, we paid attention to the details like the murals and the carvings. We felt homey while we were sitting and gazing the magnificent view. Tips: You can get cheaper price for the short and long tour if you take your time bargaining with the tour providers in the town. We took the package from our hotel because we were lazy to look for a cheaper one and the offer sounded reasonable for us. We were at one point indecisive about hiring a tour guide, but decided not to, to save the cost. We found ourselves no problem in understanding the temples by reading books, and by ear-dropping to other people's tour guide. LOL. Bring along drinking water ( you need A LOT) and snacks. Food were a bit pricey there."

Strongly suggest bike-riding the short circuit and touring the big circuit with a private tour bus. do NOT take cheap tours here as you will not enjoy the beauty of this place with a time limit. Many, many pics can be taken here so do not skimp on costs once here. Recommend the Grasshopper Bicycle tours for the short cicuit and Bunly Tours for the Big Cicuit, please see reviews of those online tripadvisor. Either way, Angkor is stunning and is a must for all in life to observe, if only once, before they kick the bucket. Safe travels all!"

Loved the whole area and as we had (semi-interested) teens with us we just did the one day, but definitely warrants more than a single visit. We had a tuk-tuk driver who gave us some information at places but I would have liked more detail along the way, so worth checking who is taking you around. At the main Angkor Wat we hired a guide from the front entrance and he was fantastic and gave us lots of background and explanation on the building and reasoning behind everything, so much so that the teens enjoyed it too! Amazing place and we just loved the whole atmosphere, but it was busy most of the time which is the only downside."

Take your time through the different places, if you have some historical perspective, you will enjoy the visit even more. Some readings or a local guide will help a lot with appreciating all the sites. if you wish to do temple hopping and picture taking routine, just visiting the 3-5 major sites will be good enough as you will find many of the temples underwhelming."

I saw ~8 of the temples in 2 days around the Siem Reap area and they were all different, interesting and amazing. The main ones are Angkor Wat (catch it at sunrise - awesome!) and Angkor Thom, plus Ta Prohm (the \"Tomb Raider\" temple). Plus there are many others to choose from. It really depends on how far you want to go and how much energy / interest you have. I had a 3-day ticket but only used 2 days. The temples are of different ages, for different purposes, built by different kings / leaders. They all have some level of carving ranging from ornate to basic. It is clear to understand why they are a World Heritage Site. I hope that the Cambodian government continues to care for the temples so that many more generations can marvel at the skills of engineering and art. A couple of things to be prepared for - the heat / humidity (water, sunscreen, hats, bug repellant) and the number of locals who will try to sell you something."

They take your photo and put your photo on the ticket, which makes for a nice souvenir. We walked all around, we just got dropped at the main temple by a tuc tuc driver and had him meet us back at noon. We were lucky the weather was pretty cool when we were there (by Cambodian standards). You can definitely walk around, or another great way to get around is by bike. You can also have a tuc tuc take you, but you see much more if you bike and walk. It is tiring, but was well worth it. We saw 5 temples on our walk and then a few more on another day when we went back. It is truly a beautiful place. However, it would be much more pleasant if they allowed no motorized vehicles int he park, this really takes away from the old charm of the place and makes the air very polluted and also creates more noise with traffic jams and people honking. I really wish they would ban all vehicles and just allow bikjes and bike tuc tuc, would be a much more authentic experience and more pleasant all around, as there are ridiculous amounts of tour buses filled with throngs of tourists and putting otu lots of smoke and pollution into the otherwise beautiful and pristine park. That being said it was amazing and we look forward to visiting again next year. There are also plenty of areas inside to get food and drinks, since likely you will spend most of the day there to see all or most of the temples. There are also lots of people trying to sell you guide books, etc, we didn't buy any and you don't really need it. You can get maps on your phoen to guide you around, that is waht we used and were fine. There are many English speaking guides there if you do want one, and that could be nice as well, not too expensive either."

They truly are a world class attraction; unfortunately, when the entire world feels that way expect to share it with a lot of people. There are three options to visit the park: a $20 one day pass, a $40 three days in a week pass, and a $60 seven days in a month pass. For the casual visitor, the choice is really between a one and three day. Most agree that two days is sufficient to see everything of note. To save money and avoid spending any more time in the crowds than necessary we chose to pack as much as we could into one day and call it good. We started early and caught the sunrise at Angkor Wat. It was cool, but if sunrises standing packed shoulder to shoulder are not your thing you might want to skip the 0430 wake up. We were biking so, to avoid the crowds as much as possible, we ignored the common clockwise progression around the grand tour and, after seeing Angkor Wat, went counterclockwise around the grand tour with one detour to see Ta Phrom. This worked out relatively well for us and we were able to see most of the temples with minimal crowds. I mentioned biking. If you are in good physical shape and it is during the cooler part of the year this is a viable option, just make sure to bring plenty of water. We did the entire grand tour plus a couple detours and my poor wife was really starting to run out of steam toward the end of the trek. We brought a little over four liters of water and ran out just before we got to the end of the circuit. There are food and water vendors along the route, however, they will charge you significantly more than fair market value. For the majority of people, I would recommend a Tuk Tuk for transportation. Doing it all in one day we didn't have time for a guide to explain everything to us so we were pretty much going to see the sites, not to learn about Khmer history.The Angkor Historical Park is an amazing place. Depending on the depth, or desired depth, of your knowledge there are multiple ways to go about seeing it. Most of it can be seen in a day, however, taking a guide, doing some research, visiting the Angkor National Museum, and spending a couple of days will give a deeper understanding of the Khmer culture. Definitely recommend a visit here!"

If you do the big temples on the first day you are a little disappointed with the lesser temples later.

Our ticket then covered us all the way through. We watched the sunset over Phnom Bakheng (although we had a long queue as it was crowded).The next day we did Angkor Wat, the most famous of the entire site and is the largest religious building in the whole world. You have to have shoulder and knees covered to see the inner sanctum. We then saw the less populated temple Banteay Kdei and the royal bath; the massive artificial lake that is Sra Srang. The former was the more interesting for us and it was almost completely ruined.We also saw Ta Prohm, known as the Tomb Raider temple as some of the Tomb Raider film was shot here. Next was Angkor Thom, then the Temple of the Elephants, the Terrace of the Lepers, Bauphon and Bayon. By this point we were templed out even though we'd seen only the tip of the iceberg for the park. There's easily a few days worth to see.It's fantastic and exploring the ruins are incredible but not a great deal of information about the history of the temples. Would recommend finding a good tuk-tuk driver to take you round to make the journey between temples quicker and they may give you a quick talk about each of them."

Of all the ancient structures that i've seen around the world this is the most impressive. The architecture and artwork differs between each complex so you're constantly met with unique and interesting designs. Perhaps the most interesting is Ta Prohm which has numerous giant fig trees growing out of the buildings. You've most likely seen pictures of this but you really do have to see it up close to appreciate this odd and beautiful nexus of nature and the artificial.I have read other reviewer's complaints about there being too many tourists here and I cannot argue with that. People desire to go to the most amazing places so that's why Angkor is so busy; the same can be said for the pyramids of Egypt, the Roman Colosseum, etc. That said, the park spans 400 square kilometres so there are plenty of places to go where there are few to no tourists. I recommend getting at least a 3 day pass so you have time to explore the popular and less popular complexes."

The scale, the setting, the engineering complexity, the intricacy of the craftsmanship and just the overall aura and ambience of the place is simply spectacular. Myself and my wife were utterly blown away by the place.Aside from the biggies; Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom, there are dozens of other interesting and amazing temples and ruins scattered across the vast Angkor Archaeological Park. Whilst Angkor Wat and Thom can get very, very crowded, the further afield temples are virtually empty. It's a much more pleasant experience wandering around them uninterrupted by bus loads of tourists.Try Preah Khan, Ta Prohm (Tomb Raider temple) and Banteay Samrae - all impressive, but less crowds.We visited for two days and to be honest, we could have done another day to enable us to slow the pace a little - we were dashing round at a fair pace. The first day we rented bicycles which was great fun as the terrain is flat and you feel closer to the place when you're travelling under your own steam - although be prepared as you can easily clock up 50km in a day. The second day we hired a tuk tuk which was very affordable, although our definition of what amounts to a full day differed greatly from that of our driver, so agree up front what you're expecting to see and the length of the trip.

AND the lighting through the 1000 year old temples was beautiful.Be aware that if the monks take you towards a prayer area and help you to pray for your family, you will be expected to provide a \"gift\". Cash is the only gift they seemed to want.I climbed to the top of Angkor Wat with my 72 year old dad - it's a steep climb up (the \"stairs\" feel more like a ladder!) but the views were incredible and it was a really special moment to have shared with him."

We visited the park at the end of July with our 3 teenagers; rainy season but still a fantastic time to go. The crowds were thin, even non-existent in places, which meant no traffic jams to reach the sites (which happens regularly in the high season according to our tuk-tuk driver), no queuing and often being able to explore a temple (or parts of it) all by ourselves. The rains came mostly in the afternoon so we were able to time our visits. How much we enjoyed the temples (and the atmosphere) was largely dependent on how crowded it was when we visited. Our favourites were Ta Phrom and the Bayon which were both fairly quiet, and deserted in places, when we visited. This was at about 8.30am. Preah Kahn came in a close second. All the temples are special; we loved the wilder, jungle-clad temples, but another may prefer the grandeur of Angkor Wat or the intricate carvings of Banteay Srei. It\u2019s just personal.For most visitors a 3-day pass will allow enough time to get a good impression of all the main temples in a relaxed tempo plus a few extras. You don\u2019t have to use the pass on consecutive days, so you can always take a break from temple touring with another activity. Try to spend at least 2 days here; a one day visit really doesn\u2019t do this park justice."

We bought 3 day passes for $40 each, which are valid for 7 days. It will take about 3 full days to see everything in the park, so if you're not going as part of a guided tour, it would be best to plan meticulously. The temples are rich in heritage, but it's highly advisable to read up about the temples and culture in advance of your visit to fully appreciate these monuments.Touring the temples can be done with guided tours, which are quite pricey, but at least you will be driven in an air-conditioned car and given water on the way (costs around $65 a day). Those who have done their \"homework\" before hand and would rather see the temples at their own pace can hire a tuk tuk ($15 a day is pretty reasonable), or even cycle around the park ($1-3 a day), but that is a lot of cycling. Another option it to take the helicopter tour. There are several restaurants in the park, though they are a bit more expensive than what one would normally pay for in Siem Reap."

He took us on a circular tour ending at the Angkor Wat complex. The whole site is amazing and it was good to see that preservation/reconstruction work is still going on at various locations. The were a lot of people around but due to the size of the complex it did not seem crowded. There were plenty of officials about to ask questions and they helped to keep people moving in some of the more restricted access parts. We only bought a day ticket and we felt we had seen enough of the site, given we were tuk-tuk'd between sites.Well organised and signposted, we had a great day, despite a really heavy spell of rain, and we ended up taking the obligatory sunset photo which was superb. Well worth the $20 entrance fee."

It was really quite amazing, and much bigger than I expected. There's many different temples in Angkor Park and in the surrounding areas, so be sure to give yourself a few days to see them all. Also, it's extremely humid (we went in Sept) and you'll only want to be out in the mornings or late afternoons, so give yourself time to escape the heat of the midday! You can buy 1,3 or 7 day park tickets, depending on how long you'll be there. You can also rent bicycles, the areas are pretty flat so it's not a grueling ride (except for the humidity) and you'll feel like a local! All these temples were built as religious complexes, and so some places won't let you in without proper dress. For women no exposed shoulders and thighs covered. I actually saw one girl wearing a tank top who couldn't go up to the top of one temple bc she didn't have anything to cover her shoulders with. It is very hot and humid! Make sure to bring a hat and sunscreen!"

The Archeological Park comprises major structures built over 900 years ago - mainly under Hindu influence, but later recognized and accepted by the Buddhists. Cambodia has had many wars with neighbours, WW2 and the Pol Pot civil war, but the Siem Reap region temples were not damaged.In fact, most of those that fell into disrepair were as the result of the Cambodian \u201csystem\u201d when new kings shifted the capital city to exert their influence. The Angkor Archeological Park is a UNESCO World Heritage area and comprises various locations and it is impossible to classify all structures equally as each structure has very different individual features.The park is well maintained and we were lucky to avoid the tourist hordes by visiting at the end of the monsoon season. The park is reasonably well developed and kept tidy, without the usual Asian trails of garbage. Built in a \u201cjungle\u201d zone, vegetation growth is prolific, but kept under control by teams of local workers. The park provides employment to thousands of local guides, cleaners, gardeners and traffic control personnel .Whilst it is understandable that Angkor Wat is the jewel in the crown due to its immensity and state of preservation, I personally preferred Ta Prohm as my favourite . It has been partially invaded by the jungle during disuse and used as a backdrop in Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider movies and I felt the energy that others have described. After Ta Prohm, my ratings were Angkor Wat, Banteay Srey, Bayon and Angkor Thom. Whilst it is outside the park a trip to Beng Mealea is well worth the journey. At this temple, its only sin was that a new king moved the capital elsewhere. Despite its magnificence, the jungle is taking over (much more than Ta Prohm).The peace and tranquility we experienced would bring peace and harmony to those with troubled souls \u2013 this is a truly a spiritual space.Truly deserving of its \u201ctop 7 wonders of the world\u201d status."

The Buddhist monks still watch over the temples and the people still hold ceremonies in them, which makes them more symbolic and sacred somehow than just remnants of a majestic and powerful empire. Lots of walking! Some few \"comfort stations\" in discrete corners of the 1? square mile. Some shady venues, lots of sun-baked walks to the cool stone temples. The artful carvings on the walls, and the huge statues and the architecture itself are all worth the trip halfway around the world to immerse yourself in this ancient culture. We had a trained guide for our pre-arranged tour, who spoke excellent English and was very personable. He was with us for the three day excursion, which included Siem Reap and vicinity.

We chose a tuk tuk and both agreed that it was the best choice. If you want comfort and luxury then go with a air conditioned taxi but you'll sweat when your outside anyway, so just have some fun. Almost every hotel will have tuk tuk driver available or you can book one very simply in the town. If you are going for that option make sure you negotiate and pick one that speaks good English. Ask them about the site, what they would show you and how much they can teach. Don't forget to smile and see if they are fun as well, the interaction with your driver is a big part so pick a good one. Quick word of warning, if you are crossing by land from Thailand at the Poipet border be ready to ne scammed, we had 5 attempts to make us over pay for our visa, do not buy one until after you have your exit stamp from Thailand, no matter what they tell you. There are some good posts in forums on trip advisor about the scams.Anywho, the sites are amazing, you can pick a 1, 3 or 5 day ticket. The tickets are valid for 24 hrs from 5pm so if you want to see sunset you can go the day before and then catch sunrise the following day, you will also avoid queuing for you ticket in the morning if you get it the day before. If you are into your temples then go for a 3 or 5 day pass otherwise you will see most of the main sites with a 1 day but, beware, it is hard work. I consider myself above average fitness but after 5 hours I was pretty tired. The temples are a must see, a particular favourite of mine was Ta Promh, but I think that is most peoples favourite. Be aware that you will have guide try to sell you their services, you can buy one for the day or just temple by temple. We had one for the Angkor Wat and would highly recommend it as they point out a lot of stuff that you would not realise on your own, like how the bases of the pillars have been worn away due to years being covered in a lot of bat poo! If you don't want a guide be firm as they are quite tricky and good at selling themselves! Finally look our for the kids. There are a lot of kids trying to sell stuff using all kinds of techniques. As with any major tourist site scams are there. Personally I don't give to kids as I believe it encourages the behaviour and their parents are even less likely to send them to school if they are making money but everyone should make a decision by themselves. Above all, wear sturdy clothes, put your Indiana Jones hat on and enjoy this mystical site with the little spark of hope in the back of your mind that there are more sites like this in the world, waiting, covered in jungle for us to find them."

They are an awesome experience which tells you much about the Khemer heritage and the ingenuity of ancient societies.Passes are $20 for a single day; $40 for three days; and $60 for seven days. If you only visit for two days, the three day pass is the way to go rather than wasting time standing in the pass line for two consecutive days for the same price.A standard rate for a tuk-tuk for the day including cold water & towels is $15. Add $5 if going to Bantreay Srei or a sunrise or sunset temple trip. Of course, those can be negotiated. To get the full experience and views, we took a tuk-tuk to Bantreay Srei and thoroughly enjoyed the countryside and natural air conditioning along the way. Cars are also available for around $25 per day.Our first day we went with a guide while the second day we spiked out on our own with a guidebook sold at most of the temples for a negotiated $5. We found the guided portion rather tedious with so much minutiae that we quickly became bored and found it difficult to sift through the information distinguishing the characteristics of each temple. Typically, a guide will cost you $25 per day.With the guidebook, we could linger at our own pace and focus on the nuts & bolts of each temple, quickly referencing and keeping them separated easily in our minds for comparative purposes. For a more extensive reference we turned to Maurice Glaize's 1944 classic, \"The Monuments of Angkor Guide\", which remains the bible of Angkor temples. This can be downloaded free from canbypublications.com onto a tablet for portable reference. This website also has excellent suggested itineraries depending on days spent, suggested times at each temple and descriptions.Exploration can become overwhelming as the day heats up so wear comfortable, appropriate shoes, hydrate frequently, and shield yourself from the sun (a travel umbrella works great). If you have time, break viewing into half days during the morning starting early leaving the afternoons open for relaxation or pool time. It's amazing what you can see in one morning, you often avoid crowds, and you certainly avoid \"temple burnout\".The Angkor temple sites are a world treasure. Don't miss them."

We heard prices of $USD35 - $USD50 for them to be your driver.If you have a book, map, camera etc, you can identify a lot of what you see yourself and set your own schedule.If it looks like rain one can go back to hotel or lunch is near go back towards town. It is your own schedule and as such you can see what you wish to see.Yes, it is hot so plenty of water. If it raisn then the heat afterwards is horrendous.Did not notice any flies or midges.It is an amazing place and worth every minute you have to see it.

Buying the pass on the first day late afternoon was a blessing as when we returned the second day's morning, there were long lines of people from tour groups and independent travelers buying ticket. Come prepared with enough US $1, $5, and $10 bills. You will encounter lots of women and children selling souvenirs, elephant print pants, drinks, meals, post cards, books, etc. And you will hear \"What your name?\", \"Where you from\", and \"Buy from me\" a lot within the park. They are poor and one sympathizes with them. But after a while, it can be annoying. Best is to put on a smile and firmly say \"No, thank you\" and move on.A very helpful guide is \"Siem Reap Angkor Visitors Guide\" published by Canby Publications (canbypublications.com). It is free and if you can get hold of one ahead of your visit or from your hotel after arrival, it would provide invaluable information on the park and its many temple ruins. The second full day, we biked from our hotel to the park and visited the main temple ruins within the small tour circuit (which includes Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Prohm). It was a fun day to bike around the park. We watched the sunset over Angkor Wat and biked back to our hotel in the dark. The third full day, we hired a tut-tut to take us to far away Banteay Srey and also the temple ruins along the grand tour circuit. We concluded that Banteay Srey is overrated and not worth the one hour to get there and another 30 to 40 minutes to get back to the eastern portion of the park. Banteay Srey is really small. While the carved stone work is what this temple is known for, we felt the time would have been better spent to re-visit Bayon and/or Ta Prohm. There are some hidden gems along the Grand Circuit, particularly Preah Khan.If you are on your own, suggest visiting the main temple ruins such as Bayon and Ta Phrom early in the morning (6 to 8 am) or in the afternoon. From 9 am to 12 noon, tour groups just overwhelme these places."

If you are not in great shape, please don't try to climb the stairs as most of them are steep and some don't have rails. Try your best to come early because the heat can be unforgiving. I didn't bother to get a tour guide, I simply read about it before the trip. Nonetheless, tour guides are relatively cheap. Please note that most of the temples are having reconstruction/restoration work, therefore not all of them are accessible to tourists.Please bring a raincoat or umbrella esp if you're travelling during the rainy season. Also don't forget the bottled water. As expected, toilets are far from the temple and had some queue so brace yourself for that.Overall,I wasn't disappointed. This place is worth all the climbing up and down the stairs. The only thing that disappointed me were the tourists who were noisy and not observing proper dress code :("

The Angkor Archaeological Park is an amazing place to visit and imagine what the ancient civilisation must have been like all those centuries ago. The most well known temple is naturally Angkor Wat, however exploring the rest of the park was the highlight of my visit. A really good way to do this is by bicycle - we hired some from town ($1 for the day) and rode out to the park, a fairly easy and flat 7km which was very doable. We bought the 3 day pass for $40USD which was a wise choice as there's loads to see and one day wouldn't do it justice. We also did the morning sunrise trip out to see Angkor Wat which was cool (and also entertaining watching the masses of tourists). Our tuk tuk driver drove us around for the rest of the day, another good way to see the park if your legs are a bit tired!"

There are pre-planned tours that all the tuk-tuk & taxi drivers are trained in and you can make your own modifications however you like. You can start before sunrise and end with a sunset if you wish or just go for a portion of the day.You will be captivated, enchanted even and you will stay longer than you planned.Unless you do not have the time, a one day pass ($20) is not enough, a 3 day pass ($40) will be a wiser investment.The Tuk Tuk for the whole day will be $10 to $15 depending on the distance covered in your tours. Some drivers will have a complimentary cold bottle of water waiting for you at the end maybe even a cool refresher towel. Some drivers may have limited language skills but plenty of genuine enthusiasm and a map of the park. When planning with your driver to go to lunch, let him know your budget, otherwise he will naturally take you to a restaurant that maybe higher priced than you had budgeted.A trip to the National Museum is highly recommended (with audio guide $15) better before you tour the temples but not necessarily essential."

This is an evocative site, a ruin unreconstructed, and thought to be the temple that Angkor Wat was based on. Several friends we took around the sites agreed it was the most interesting. Combine it with a visit to Koh Ker, the countryside is beautiful, people beautiful, there is a toilet at Koh Ker and food available. Our guide took us to a restaurant in a little village near Beng Melea and we had a great lunch. Well worth a look."

Although there are so many temples and at the end of the 3rd day you can start thinking \"one more temple\", all temples are very different. All of them are in good shape, the maintenance is perfect and in general the staff preserve and takes care of the area in a perfect way. Also the less famous temples are very fascinating, with vegetation growing on the ruins (but being kept under control) adding charm to the place. I only recommend to avoid the elephant ride and the sunset: too crowded and frankly speaking not much to see, not worth the long wait, the effort to climb the hill/temple and the crowd."

Tipically one day costs 15 USD for the central area of the park (Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and the main temple in this area).If you want to visit Benteay Srei (at least 30 km far Angkor Wat) you have to add at least 15 USD more to reach the temple.An idea of visit could be (in order of importance):Day 1: Angkor Wat (4 hours) - Ta Prohm (2,5 hours) - Benteay Kdei (1 hour) - Ta Keo (1 hour) - Phnom Bakheng (or Preah Khan) (1,5 hours)Day 2: Benteay Srei (2,5 hours included travel) - Kbal Spean (2 hours) (entrance 5 Km far from Benteay Srei, 1.5 Km beatiful walk in the jungle) - Angkor Thom (4 hours)Day 3: Roulos Group (Bakong) far 15 km from Siem Reap and the other remaining sites.In all entrance of the main temple there are local food and beverage.

We've been SEA for two and a half months and are \"templed\" out! So despite being told that we really need several days to see the temples, we opted for the one day pass. This was great for us -- we did the little circuit and saw some of the \"different\" temples -- most are looking all alike to us at this point. We had a full day 8 am to 6 pm and all agreed it was great, but that one day was enough for us. My suggestion is that if you love temples buy the three or seven day pass, if not opt for the one day. There's other neat things in Siem Reap -- try the Silk Farm for something different!"

Means you need a car or a tuk tuk as the archeological area is out. Nevertheless, if you go closer you may have more troubles to find the right accomodation. My (in 2005) was a nightmare.First day to visit Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Prohn (jungle temple). Means a full day and around 20usd for tuk tuk.But the real surprise comes in day 2, when you will visit other temples supposed to be minor but equally beautiful, big and impressive.These are out of the main group, so you will ride many kms and spend some time in the tuk tuk, but it deserves your efforts and the 15 dollars.Entrance fee is 20usd for 1 day, 40 for up to 3 days.There are a couple of check points to enter the most religious spots: visitors with short pants or uncovered shoulders won't be admitted."

If you're just looking for places to check off your list, go see it. If not, steer clear.

Firstly, it gets very crowded at points, in particular at sunrise and in the \"Tomb raider\" bits. I think it would be well worth aiming to dodge the crowds as much as possible. For example at sunrise it was a relief simply walking 50 meters to right of the main crowd and sit on the grassy field. You miss the reflection in the pool but if you value some tranquility in front of squeezing together with a bunch of people all trying to get the best view - that's my hot tip. Otherwise, well inside there is alot to discover so, at least in the morning, it's not too buzy. However this did not seem to apply to Ta Prohm, which just lost a lot of its Indiana Jones feeleing in the crowds and felt sadly unaventurous. Perhaps going here first thing in the morning would do the trick? Secondly, and perhaps I should not be too surprised, but some of the market bits are atmosphere dampers as they sometimes even seek their way into the ruins. HOWEVER. So far I have been awfully negative, but Angkor IS an absolute treasure and there is so much to look at and explore - I fully endorse the reviews below. As a final word of advise, if you do not have a guide, do a bit of research beforehand- visit the Angkor National Museum, watch a documentary, and it will amplify the experience."

After getting souvenirs at the market near Angor Wat and climbing and adventuring through the temple, we found ourselves a little tired and drained, but we only had a one-day pass, and only one day to visit. There are so many different complexes and sites to see! My favorites though were the ones that came after Angor Wat on the circuits from the map. These were less tourist heavy and you could climb freely; there were hardly any mandatory paths so you can adventure freely through the many arches and pathways. This said, the architecture of these sights is not as put together as Angor Wat. Important things:One needs to definitely wear sturdy shoes: hiking boots or tennis shoes are the bestYou cannot climb to the top of Angor Wat and another temple with a short skirt (must be to knees), or with shoulders exposing. There is a market to buy pants/shirts if needed.Bring plenty of water. Of course there are places to buy some within the grounds, but it is always good to have some on you."

My husband and I are travelling with our 19 month old daughter - our visit to Angkor Archaeological Park was a fantastic experience and we have some incredible photos from it. Just note that:- There is some restoration work in progress at the moment, and the scaffolding may be prominent in some of the 'iconic' photos. - Visitors can go almost anywhere, however some areas may be slippery in the wet season or unsafe - our toddler was able to roam comfortably in some grassy areas but she was carried in a backpack for most places (as you might expect). - For women - it's useful to wear trousers if you plan to visit the 'heart' of some of the main sites. I wore shorts and would not be allowed to access the central points.- There is limited information about each site, and I do think that for the price ($60USD per person for a 7 day pass) that some information should be provided to 'unlock' the story behind each building. We had a great reference book, and others have hired personal guides - either or both of these options are helpful to get value from the visit.- Tuk Tuk was the best transport for us - gave us flexibility to go anywhere and anytime. Most tuk tuks have a legal maximum of 3 passengers.- It's highly likely that you will be approached by children selling wares at each site. We were given advice to avoid purchasing from these children because it encourages their continued exploitation. It's hard to say no to these kids, so an alternative way to support them is to give a gift (e.g. a pencil, notepad, wrapped candy) rather than money. We got a 7 day pass, and spent early mornings (5am - 10am) and late afternoons (3pm - 6.30pm) at the temples. This allowed us to capture sunrise / sunset photos and avoid crowds."

First point - make sure you pay the extra for a local guide - he will tell you so much more of the history and current renovations.We were surprised atnthe scale of the park and temples, if you are expecting a temples you can walk around in 10 minutes you are in for a big surprise - these are huge.A number of the temples are of the same style so are repeated and they have all been Hindu and Budist so the statutes have be defaced in the part but this doesn't take from the marvel.Our favourite was the temple used for Tomb Raider movie - Ta Prohm because of the fantastic trees and roots.If you're going to Cambodia, this is a must see.

Please don't think that means we didn't like it...we loved it. We just aren't ones for long detailed guided tours and easily go to \"temple overload\". We went to the National Museum the day before to begin learning the history of Angkor and spent a couple of hours there. We also watched a video on the history of Angkor provided on DVD in our hotel the night before and I read the historical fiction novel \"Temple of a Thousand Faces\", which I highly recommend (which tells the story of Jayavarman VII and his queen's recapture of Angkor from the Cham invaders) ahead of time, too. Having this \"humanized\"connection to a place (even if fictionalized) really enhances the visit for me. We hired a tuk-tuk for the day and completed the Small Circuit by 2:30 pm. I'm sure we missed many beautiful temples and stories about the bas-reliefs, but our Angkor experience was perfect for us. One of the highlights for me were the numbers and varieties of beautiful butterflies flitting around the grounds the entire day. We were planning to go back for sunset that evening, but the rain did not permit that. Instead of a guide, we bought one of the books from a seller in front (retail $27.95, started at $15, bargained to $5) and read our own insights. The souvenir hawking was similar to that around the Forbidden City in Beijing and, while expected, still mildly annoying. I was surprised that they were allowed well into the grounds of the approach to the temples, rather than required to stay outside.But not to end on a negative note - we have loved our visit to Angkor and Siem Reap in general so far (minus our still-missing piece of luggage). On to Battambang today!"

I opted for the 3 day pass. A 1 day pass costs $20 and a 3 day pass is $40. I think the other option was a 7 day pass for $60 but as I am not a massive history or archeological buff 7 days was definitely too long for me. I think most people agree that the big 3 to see are Angkor Wat, The Bayon and Ta Prohm. It's definitely possible to do these in 1 day and even visit some other smaller temples as well as Angkor Thom. I would recommend a tuk tuk to do this. I think a car just isn't as much fun. Be sure to bring plenty of water, a hat and sunscreen. You also can't enter some temples if you have bare shoulders. Sunrise at Angkor is touristy but amazing and worth the 4am wake up all. I only tried sunset once and it was too cloudy. I hired a tuk tuk to visit Banteay Srei which is about 30km away from Siem Reap. I can't say the temple itself was worth it but the drive was really pretty. On the same day we visited some of the Roulos temples, again not amazing. We also stopped at Banteay Samre which I loved. It was very quiet and had some great photo opportunities. You should also consider renting a bike. Obviously on a bike you will struggle to cover as much ground but its a good option for day 3 to revisit your favorite temple or see a new temple. I cycled the Grand Circuit (26km I think), leaving my hostel at 5am to avoid the midday/afternoon heat. It was wonderful. I visited Preah Kahn which was another of my favorites. Very atmospheric with no crowds. I did not hire a guide. I'm not a big history buff and wanted to just see the key sites at my own speed. I downloaded a great guide on my iPad. Cambodia: The Temples of Angkor. One of the Approach Guides. Written by David and Jennifer Raezer. It has profiles of the temples, tips on key features to look out for as well as photos and detailed directions on finding them (eg behind the 8th column on the left)."

            "review": "A Day Tour Experience of Angkor. Angkor Archaeological Park comprises endless number of temples and sites that it would take several days or even weeks to see them all especially for students of archaeology and history. Major sites however can be seen in one day provided a good plan and spontaneous tour is arranged ahead. The best way is to get an accredited tour guide and a taxi to help you get around. Taking a Tuktuk is a little less expensive but I would recommend it for a 3-day or 1 week tour packages. The exhausting heat, going up and down the temples, long walk plus the extensiveness of the sites are physically taxing and will limit one's mobility with a tuktuk.Fortunately for us, I contacted Nak Seongmo, a college sophomore who drives his own taxi to pursue his studies. He was the one who drove us from the airport to the hotel. Cambodians are wonderful people and Nak was exceptionally polite, honest, warm, caring and safe driver. He had prepared cold bottles of water in the car, would take us pictures, brought us to good restaurants, and tell what would be safe and best for us. He was very knowledgeable of Cambodian history, places (particularly within Siem Reap) and its people. He even shared his own experiences and that of his family and the life in rural Siem Reap. I learned so many things from him about Kampuchea, the Angkor temples, the Khmer Empire, the Pol Pot's regime and present day Cambodia. Its like we had a tourist guide and driver in one :)On the day of tour, we got up early, bring extra clothes, proceeded to get a day tour pass then catched the sunrise at Angkor Wat while enjoying an early morning walk in and out of this impressive temple. After 2-3 hours we took breakfast at the nearby Angkor Cafe just across the road facing the west gate of Angkor Wat. Next we proceed to Angkor Thom and Bayon Temple all the way to see the old Royal Palace going out towards the Terraces of Elephants. Before noon, we proceeded towards Ta Prohm and had lunch in a restaurant nearby after which we spent about 1-2 hours to see giant trees grew within this temple inside the forest. Bantaey Srei was the next destination, some 27 kms noth-east. Here you'll see the pink temple oftentimes referred to as the 'Lady Temple' where carvings and wall designs are ostentatiously elegant & elaborate and stone statues are well preserved. A refreshing snack here plus souvenir shopping was a good option before heading back south towards Pre Rup to see the sunset before 6pm.. A sumptuous dinner after some stroll / shopping at Siem Reap's Night Market completes the day. Nak waited long in the car park and volunteered to drive us back to the airport for our late night flight back to Manila. All these (services) for only US$50 he asked from us. In appreciation of the wonderful experience we had in Siem Reap - Nak Seongmo being a very BiG part of it - we gave him something beyond his expectation to which he was tearfully thankful. I proudly recommends Nak if you're planning to visit Siem Reap soon , contact him at nangnak_angkor@yahoo.com"

            "review": "Awesome!! A must-visit destination. It has taken me a long time to finally getting round to visit Angkor Wat with my family. We finally realized our wish in June. We thought it would be really hot but the rain the previous day had cooled the weather considerably. The structures were truly impressive. My favorites were Angkor Wat, the Bayon and Ta Prohm. Some advice for visitors: you can definitely see all the major sights in one day, unless you are an avid historian. Get an accredited guide and a car to take you around. Saves a lot of time. Start off your day at 530 am to watch the sunrise at Angkor Wat. By 830, you should be able to complete all of Angkor Wat. This would be a good time to stop and have breakfast. The next stops would be the various structures at Angkor Thom. Depending on how fast you view the main structures, you could finish them all by 2 to 4pm. Next, you could extend your visit to Bantaey Srei, which would be a good 45 min drive. I highly recommend taking the drive out to see it. It is quite a small temple compared to the others but the carvings and stone statues are really well preserved. Finally, you can visit Pre Rup to see the sunset at 6pm. This would be a good 12 to 13 hour day, but it wasn't rushed, neither was it too tiring. The key to doing this route is to hire a car and guide. Can't do this on tuk tuk, it would be too tiring and hot given the heat. For me and my family, one day is enough to take in all the major sights and learn about the history of the temples and the people living at that time. We went there during what was considered the low season, so it isn't as packed as what was described by some postings. However, being such a famous tourist destination, you will expect some crowd. June isn't as hot as Feb to May, and since its the low season, many of the restaurants and massage places in Siem Reap are rather quiet. Cambodians are generally friendly people and a number of them speak English with an American accent. We went horse riding passing through villages and the children were all very friendly waving and saying hi to us. We left Siem Reap with a really good impression of Cambodia and I learnt a lot of history about the Magnificent Khmer empire of ages past and the monuments of their legacy."

Be early (before 5 am) to get a good position along the edge of the pond. After the sun comes up go around to the eastern side of the site to get great early morning light for wide angle shots. ANGKOR THOM (INCLUDING BAYON): The biggest site and will take at least 4 hours minimum to do it all properly. Go early in the morning and start at the far end (elephant landing) then work your way up through the complex to finish at Bayon. The afternoons are crowded and hot. The Bayon has no shade providing tree growth and the black stone work absorbs a lot of heat.TA PROHM: Visit at early morning or late afternoon to avoid the package tour hordes. Plenty of shade provided by all the tree growth on the site. ENTRY FEE: Buy the 3 day pass for USD 40 instead of the single day pass at USD 20BEST TIME TO VISIT: Go in May.

Honest Tuk-Tuk info below. -Start early to avoid the crowds and beat the heat (which is impossible). -Bring, or buy a hat and long sleeve white shirt or a sun umbrella. Slather the kids with sunscreen. -Early morning sunrise and evening sunsets are nice but nothing to freak out about. Especially if you enjoy sleeping in. It's nice to get an early start though and sunrise forces you into it.-Get the three day pass, or better yet - get the week pass. You don't have to use your days consecutively, which is great!-We all want the best deal but be sure to tip people (especially your driver!) Everyone is hounding and harassing us because they are that poor. Every cent counts. With that said, avoid buying the postcards from the kids. Once you do, prepare to be mobbed.-The book is worth it, even if you just leaf thru it. In the back is a great itinerary suggestion.-My tuk Tuk driver was amazing! Feel free to use him - (tell him \"Becky, like Bakery\" sent you and expect VIP serviceHis name is Setha 855 77 73 13 57 or 855 97 912 58 87-Get a guide at one of the temples (Angor Wat is a good place to start) or hire someone for the day, at least once. -Overall, don't feel bad about being scammed. It sucks but these people have so much competition (with all of the other people selling the exact same thing or services) and they have NOTHING. Really. They are so desperate for just .50 cents. Literally, they are just trying to survive. -We are rich in comparison. Yes, haggle with them and play the game but don't feel too bad if you paid a little extra. When you buy a T-shirt for $2.00, know that they are only making .50 cents and in the low season you might be their only customer that day. If you pay $3.00, they just got $1.50-Back in town, the \"I don't want your money, just please buy me baby formula\" is a scam. They return it later for the cash. I fell for it because I'm a sucker (and the kid looked so hungry!) BUT I made sure to open it and mix a bottle at the counter so she could not return it.-It's lovely. Try your best to support the local community.-Definitely check out the Cambodian Circus one of your evenings. I purchased my ticket at the location. It's fifty cents to a few dollars cheaper if you buy it thru your hotel or guest house, but buying on-site gives all the money to the school. Which ever route you go, it doesn't matter, just go.-If you have a chance, especially if you are from the US, go to the Land Mine Museum. It's small but a worthwhile little stop.-Prepare to fall in love with Cambodia but know that it will break your heart."

I bought a 3 day ticket for USD$40 and spent 15 hours over 3 days exploring a dozen temples and my only complaint was that it wasn't enough time. Every temple was new and amazing and even in 3 days I wasn't able to see everything I wanted to. In retrospect I should have bought the $60 week pass.My advice is to plan to stay longer and pace yourself. A half-day (about 5 hours) is a perfect stretch of time. Beyond that you may get too hot, tired, or experience temple fatigue. Even if you reach your daily fill of temple fun, the enthusiasm and majesty will return the next morning (at least it did for me).Truly one of the most memorable places I have ever visited.Top temples for me were 1. Bayon, 2. Banteay Srei, and 3. Ta Prohm.Enjoy!"

            "review": "This is why you came here, after all :). I will be submitting reviews on all the individual temples, but I thought it fitting to review the park in general. Angkor Archaeological Park is the main reason tourists come to Siem Reap and most of the ruins you want to see fall under it's management. I would recommend getting a seven day pass, even if you only plan to spend a few days in the temples. You may find yourself captivated by the history and you may decide you want to spend an extra day or two wandering around. It's not a great deal extra to get the seven day pass and it saves a lot of inconvenience. They police the pass fairly well also, and there are staff members at every temple checking your pass. Take care of your pass - if it's damaged in any way they will not accept it and you won't get a refund. All in all, a lovely place. I would recommend using a tuk tuk driver to see everything as it's a great way to see things up close and personal, and you can find a good driver for about $15 a day. Many of the drivers in the area can make recommendations about what temples are good to see, but if you are after a guide it is probably ethical to pay a second person. (Mind you there are guides to hire at many of the bigger temples). As a general rule, go out as early as you can (around 7am) and come back when the heat gets too much. Have a nap or a swim in your hotel pool, then head out again around 3pm.A warning though; as many people get temple fatigue, some drivers will recommend you to go to Tonle Sap Lake for a bit of a break. Beware. Take a look at some of the reviews of the lake as there is a bit of a scam going on there."

Highly recommended for anyone visiting Cambodia, interested in history or the history of Hindu and Buddhist history. Tips:1) If you can, avoid going in April! Although we have been warned, we went regardless because we live in the Middle East and thought we could handle the heat - we were wrong: it is extremely hot and humid and visiting Angkor Wat from 5am-2pm left us soaking wet, dehydrated, and drained even the next day.2) We were not advised by our guide, but if your children are <12 and you don't pay entrance fee for them to the Site, it means they can't enter 1 of the AW temples without a paid ticket. Our children were really disappointed!3) Consider your young children - the day(s) are long, hot and physically tiresome. We saw parents being angry at their young children for crying and not wanting to pose for photos after a long day - even our young teenage boys and us were exhausted by mid-day 4) The average couple of family can do max 3 temples in 1 day (we saw 3 of the main ones, but I barely made the last one5) Bring and drink lots of water, sunscreen, hat, cool comfortable clothes and shoes (though shoulders and knees should be covered in temples 6) Even if you are not interested in taking photos at sunrise, start the tour at 5am or as soon after that as possible and don't go back to your hotel to have breakfast and then to return. Starting the tour at 5am means you start before it really gets hot. 7) We were glad we had a private AC van to transfer us between hotel and AW and between sights (and not a Tuk-Tuk). It helped to cool down between sights"

Still, the experience of visiting the park including the Angkor Wat was amazing. A few observations:(a) There are 1-day, 2-day or 3-day tickets, costing 20,40 or 60 dollars for each person. Well, there are enough attractions for several days but I guess, for most people who just want to experience the view of amazing historical structures (and are not really interested in observing minute historical details), even a 1-day ticket should be sufficient, though a 2-day ticket would be more optimal. A 1-day tour will not allow visiting every structure around but one can manage visiting first Banteay Srey, then Bayon and finally the Angkor Wat. (b) Some temples do not allow people not properly dressed. My wife was not allowed inside Baphuon for wearing sleeveless. Later we came to know that sleeveless dress is not allowed to the top part of the main Angkor Wat as well. So, we bought a new T-shirt before going to Angkor Wat."

One tip is to arrive early (perhaps travel out - it's ten minutes out of Siem Reap central - over a period of 3 days) to not only avoid the heat, but also a lot of the crowds. It's always more pleasant visiting such sights with fewer people around! "

The argument that one might not be impressed by the rest of the temples after having first seen Angkor Wat does not hold, as each temple is unique and beautiful in its own right. Being the main attraction with Bayon, go there first, while you're fresh at the beginning of the trip to Siem Reap.The compounds for most of the temples are huge and require quite a bit of walking. My family and i ended up spending at least twice the time we'd alotted for any of the temples for that and many other reasons...So, if you're enjoying the architecture, are prone to stop and listen to the music by local artists in the compounds or shop for souvenirs, or don't mind just sitting and wondering at the structures and nature's power, you might do the same! Also, consider the weather, especially later in the dry season, when the heat is draining.DAY 1: I would suggest going to Angkor Wat for sunrise, seeing the temple and then going to 2 or 3 of the smaller temples around, such as Preah Khan, Ta Som and Mebon.DAY 2: Go to Banteay Srei at sunrise or in the early morning; then visit the Landmine Museum on the way back to Siem Reap. See Ta Phrom and end with a sunset at the small temple of Pre Rup.DAY 3: Start at Bayon, walk the grounds and take an elephant ride around the main structure (sometimes, you'll need to check in before just to make sure a tour group hasn't booked them up). Come back in the late afternoon and finish with a remork ride around the Angkor complex, stopping at the smaller temples such as Phnom Baken, Neak Pean and Banteay Kdei or revisiting some of the temples you liked the previous days. The remork ride with a cool evening breeze was beautiful and relaxing.Shopping: We bought some lovely charcoal rubbings on parchment (the local artists might be working off wood blocks) at the Preah Khan entrance. You do have to sift through and check the quality and then bargain down their prices, but it was worth it and made for lovely gifts. However, i'd bought some at the National Museum in Phnom Penh for much less and they were of top quality without the hassle of haggling."

I enjoyed the balance of receiving information and just roaming on my own. I had a tuk tuk driver for 5-6 hours one day and it cost $15. Avoid hiring them through someone as the person arranging it gets a cut. I'm not sure if you will be able to get such a good price but try to see if your guesthouse deals with independent tuk tuk drivers without serving as a middle man. I enjoyed the main temple complexes as well as the smaller, less visited temples. It really is a place where you can find interest wherever your interest lies. If you are touring for 2-3 days go for the 3 day pass as one day is $20 and 3 days is $40 (the same as 2 days). There are always lots of hawkers around and you can buy a variety of souvenirs. Guidebooks and postcards for a dollar and even temple rubbings and figurines. The constant \"hey lady/sir\" can be quite tiring, though. Beware of local boys in the ruins. I was approached by two who asked me my name and where I was from and began giving me a speech about school and whatnot. I think they wanted to get money as they approached me in a remote area of the temple, they were hanging out in the work zone and ran away as soon as someone approached so I assumed they were up to no good."

We would really love to go back some day. We hired a driver before our arrival and were very warmly welcomed by him throughout the trip (we went for air conditioned car because of the heat but you could try his tuk tuk as well). He speaks fluent English and some Mandarin and he is very keen to introduce Cambodia to you and explain things about Cambodia and the temples to you (www.mrvuthy.com). It is a great way to get to know more about Cambodia! We were picked up by the driver at the airport and went to the hotel to settle down. Then we went to buy tickets at the gate (a 3-day pass which starts to count only on the next day since we bought the tickets in the evening) - no time to lose! Our driver was amazing - he knew exactly how to beat the crowds (ie what time to go to which temple) so we managed to take a lot of great pictures without waiting for the crowds to go by (which could seem forever). If you have time, we strongly recommend you to go visit other temples as well outside the park - our driver took us to Preah Vihear Temple (for which Cambodia and Thailand fought for ownership for a long time) which was totally worth a visit and Koh Ker. Overall, an amazing trip with the most wonderful driver!"

We managed to cover 5 temples \u2013 Bayon, (most interesting one with the faces) Baphuon, Ta Keo (beware of stairs, they are steep and without holding rails but fun!), Elephant Terrace (enjoyed this one too), Terrace of the Leper King, Ta Prohm (the Tomb Raider temple and my favourite) and Angkor Wat. It took us 7 hours and by the end of it we had enough. We opted to hire a car and a drive for USD30 for a full day. While tuk tuk is a cheaper option, the heat does get unbearable and it is nice to jump into an air-conditioning car from one temple to another. If you can afford it, I suggest you hire a car. Tip: A large cold mineral water bottle should cost between $1-2."

You are supposed to be able to buy them after a certain time and have them valid for sunset and the next few days but we bought around 3pm as as we only needed a two day pass ($40US for 3 days - US dollars everywhere! we occasionally got local currency 1000riels = 25cents - but we would just give it back at the next transaction). Buy your tickets later in the day if you can, the line up in the morning we passed was crazy. Keep your ticket handy - they will punch it at the entrance and check it at certain temples. Shoulders must be covered and girls need to cover their legs. The tour groups seemed to ignore this, but I saw some girls turned away from climbing some temples because they were wearing shorts and guy had to wear his girlfriend's shawl as he had a tank top on. There are tons of tour groups, a lot of people on bikes and tuk tuks and taxis. We rented a tuk tuk for a few hours to see Angkor Wat on the first day and then a taxi(the guy we got from the airport) for a full tour. If you don't do well with heat rent a taxi as AC makes a huge difference. Our taxi guy was apparently a taxi and tour guide in one. It cost about $50 to do all the temples in one day as we went out further. I'm not sure if this was expensive or not but I'm not much of a bargainer. Angkor wat is super crowded, probably because it's not huge and it's the one everyone knows. If you want to climb it you have to be there before 4 or 5pm. If you want to get the iconic reflecting pool shot then walk to the left-most corner of the left \"pond\" when facing angkor wat and you'll get it. Angkor Thom is quite big. I really liked the \"tomb raider temple\" because it's got all the trees, it can also get busy but the temples further away from angkor wat are less crowded - unless you go to the ladies temple(banteay srei) and then it's very crowded as the tour buses go for its amazing carvings.Take water with you - though your taxi driver/guide might bring water. There are people(and many kids) that sell drinks at the bigger temples and post cards/books everywhere ($1 for 10!, $1 for a book!) Apparently the kids go to half day school so half the day they spend at the temples trying to sell trinkets. It kind of ruins the ambiance when you see the massive market outside angkor wat(it's next to the reflecting pool) but I must say the drink vendors are wonderful when it is that hot. We didn't eat in the park but there seem to be places to eat near the parking lots. Your guide might take you to a restaurant. Our taxi driver drove us to a small restaurant that seemed to be geared to tourists, the food seemed authentic(and upstairs had AC), but the westerners ate in one section while the tour guides sat in another, still all food is cheap and good so I wouldn't worry about it.I'm not sure if Angkor is ever not crowded, perhaps during rainy season. We didn't do sunrise so i can't comment on that. We got to the outer reaches of the park around 9-10am and people were there. Angkor Thom is big enough that it doesn't feel super crowded. We were at Angkor wat later in the day and stayed until the sun started to go down, the colours didn't really change much so I'm not sure what the draw is, at which point there is a mass exodus from the park as everyone goes into Siem Reap to have their feet massaged ($1 for 10 mins) and eat dinner.Just remember that it is hot. I can't stress that enough. You will be climbing temples in the sun all day so be prepared!"

Possibly in my opinion, which has limited research, I think they (rebuilders sponsored by other countries) are going too far with the restorations. Replicated worn and broken stone blocks and carvings can go too far, especially when carvings are not even of the century the temples were built. But, all in all, fantastic experience, I'm glad I experienced it at the beginning of restoration so I still witnessed how the blocks lay, and with the trees growing through. Small tip - take cash because there are a lot of stalls selling bits and pieces. And make a judgement call on buying from kids.....if they are there making money, why would they go to school?"

The driver provided cold water for us all day .I suggest getting the 3 day pass , this way you can see it all and not feel rushed. Our driver was great and took us to the less crowded areas first. The temples really are amazing and some are so different. My favourites were Ta Prohm ,which has fantastic picture opportunities and Preah Khan which is huge and was less crowded. Lots of walking and it is hot! I managed just fine in flip flops . I wore shorts so I wasn't allowed to climb the temple inside Angkor Wat since it still is an active temple. Although there were others who were permitted to go up (??) so if you want to climb it, have your knees and shoulders covered. Very busy everywhere except Preah Khan. My only complaint is that there are tons of people and kids selling stuff outside the temples . I know they need the money so outside is not the issue . It is that they are inside the temples as well, yes INSIDE ! Really takes away the beauty and significance of the temples when you have someone asking you to buy things all the time and have stuff set up inside the temple grounds. Watch out for anyone who is overly friendly who follows you around and is acting like a guide pointing things out or where to take a good picture. A young man (20's) was following us for about 15 mins and offered to take our picture etc . We knew he would want a tip so after we were done my husband went to give him $2 and said thanks . The guy says \" No it's $10 a person \" my husband says \"no\" and he says to us \" well this is too cheap , I am going to go get the tourist police.\" He was very very friendly up until this point. We told him we didn't ask for him to tour us around and my husband gave him $5 so he would just leave us alone. I know they need the money but don't enjoy it when you feel scammed. The children are very cute and very good sales people but giving them money or buying from them keeps them out of school. The kids even say \" i cant go to school if you don't buy \" . Instead spend your money to donate supplies to a school. It's very hard to say no since they stay on you the whole time. We were still very friendly with all of them but firm on our no to buy. Besides that , the temples really are a must see!"

Although Angkor wat itself is almost perpetually invaded by Chinese tourists, making it exceedingly crowded, it is truly wonderful to behold! And after all, it is the best preserved ancient Hindu temple of the world, as far as I know! Also we loved the Bayon temple with its illustrious, stone carved faces and even better still the complex of Ta Prohm which is totally mind blowing, partly overgrown as it is by huge jungle trees and their massive, winding roots. We payed an admission fee allowing us access to the greater most part of the Angkor region for all in all three days but decided, although the price was rather high, to add in an extra day since there was so much to see, not only including the temples mentioned above but numerous other ancient ruins which may not be quite as spectacular but definitely worth the visit.We hired a tuk tuk with a driver who didn't give us all that much information, which was OK since there is usually a guide for hire at most temples in case one should be needed . There are eaters spread out a little here and there though these are generally overpriced and serve food which we found as being a little bland. And then there are (often very young) vendors everywhere trying to sell you all sorts of stuff, from post cards to music instruments and of course, pineapple, coconut, and bananas like everywhere else in Cambodia.But one item you can't do without when trekking around in Angkor is water, by the gallons!"

Angkor Thom was also impressive, with all the faces on the temple. Then we went to the temple that was the reason we went to Cambodia in the first place: the jungle temple. We really like the big tree on top of the building and was very much looking forward to it. What a let down - they were doing construction work and that area was closed for visitors. Very dissapointing. =( But it's probably gonna look better than ever when it's done. The contruction work they have done to other temples is amazing.After those three temples we started to get a bit sick and tired of stone and salesmen. At the bigger temples the sellers are outside and you can walk away from them easily, but at some of the smaller ones they are actually inside the temple area, following you around. Even policemen try to sell you touristy things like pins, or want to give you a tour (not for free of course).The second day of temples felt totally unnecessary. Everything just looked alike, and we didn't really enjoy it any longer. Our taxi driver noticed, so we finished early.I would recommend that (if you're not really, really into temples) you just buy the one-day ticket and go see the biggest ones."

I was quite overwhelmed when I started to do my research upon seeing how many temples there were to see. To simplify things, I found that there were 2 main loops of temples; the big loop and the small loop (often referred to in tour/transport guides). The small loop covers all of the more famous temples, such as Angkor Wat, the Bayon temple (the smiling faces) and Ta Prohm (the tomb raider temples). I completed both circuits, one each day, and organized it through my accommodation (The Kool Hotel). The first day I completed the big loop in an air conditioned car and without a guide, the second covering the small loop in a tuk tuk with a guide, as was recommended to me. I was advised the longer distances would be more comfortable in a car and that the history of the more famous temples would be better appreciated with a guide. The temples were beautiful and well worth the visit. But if I had to do it again, or give anyone going any advice, I would suggest; if you are only going for a few days (like us, we went for 3 nights), do not do well in the heat and crowds and are not particularly interested in the detailed history of each place, than simply do the small loop with a guide or travel book. That way, you see the truly impressive temples Siem Reap has to offer at a relaxed pace. Space them out, and go as early in the day as you can to avoid some of the heat and crowds, then have lunch and relax in your hotel pool or air conditioned rooms. Trying to fit everything in in our short trip, we found ourselves exhausted after the 2 full days, I developed a heat rash out in the sun all day, and by the end we were sadly, all templed out..."

I would compare the feeling to seeing Chichen Itza in Mexico, Pompeii in Italy, Forbidden City in Beijing and Olympia in Greece.One important note about entering Cambodia, You must have ONE COMPLETELY BLANK PAGE in your Passport for them to be able to apply your tourist visa. Getting the VISA was no problem and done very efficiently at the Siem Reap Airport. Do not bother getting pictures beforehand as they scan the picture in your passport for $1 extra and it adds no time to the process. We had to sign a release for Bangkok Airways in Bangkok as my my wife did not have a completely blank page in her passport and also sign at Cambodian immigration giving permission for them to apply the VISA over on existing sticker. Finally we were asked for \"tip\" by a different official - a well spent $10 USD!We decided to skip the sunrise and arrived at the park at 8.30 am we had an excellent guide who was fluent in English and French with excellent knowledge of the temples, in fact he spent several years as a monk. His name is Porheng Ieng, send me a personal message if you wish to contact him.We decided to do the small loop - started at Bayon with the wonderful faces defined by the rising sun and a lull in the crowd, some of whom had departed for breakfast. From there we did the rest of the Ankor Thom including the terraces of the elephant and the leaper king ending at Ta Prohm before lunch at 12.30 pm.After lunch we explored Anchor Wat for 2 hours before heading over to Angkor Balloon situated 1 km to the west of main gate of Angkor Wat for different perspective from the air. See separate review but well worth the $15 cost (cash only, no credit card)Couple of practical points, keep your admission pass as dry as possible, a feat in the high humidity, you need to present at the entrance of all the major temples and to use the clean official washroom for free. If the pass is mutilated you will need to by a second one at $20 USD.We had a private air conditioned car that provided a cool haven between each temple - highly recommended - no such luck if you opted for the cheaper tuk tuk.All in all, a long tiring day, if i had it do over, I would opt for 3 days and spread the temples over at least 2 days because of the heat and humidity. I now have new respect for the hardships that the Marines faced as they trekked through the forests with heavy gear during the Vietnam War."

From a World Heritage perspective, I could only agree that Angkor is indeed one of the best cultural wonders (if not the best), and is an incredible engineering feat the world has to offer. It's definitely a top notcher. For some reasons, I appreciated Angkor Wat better in the afternoon - at sunset - than during the popular and obligatory sunrise visit where all tourists to Angkor are expected start their journeys with. In either case, it was such a delight to see that Angkor still receives a lot of visitors even during off peak seasons! Of all the many temples and ensembles I have seen, I really cherished my experience at Bayon, the 'almost secret' ground alleys of the Terrace of the Leper King, and Prasat Kravan - the last two only receiving a handful of tourists. Prasat Kravan (which has a twin temple as well in Takeo province - the Prasat Neang Khmau) is probably one of the under-appreciated temples in Angkor, but I personally think that it is one of the most unique - the painted murals of the central tower was indeed a find, and it has a history much older than most. Unfortunately, I never got to feel the amazement that people usually claim to have experienced at Sras Srang (the royal bath) as it was under renovation when I last visited. Aside from the enigmatic temples in the area, I find the water system - barays and the canals - to be just as interesting and intriguing. It has to be remembered that Angkor is also a large hydropolis, a water city. TIP 1: I always find that watching a performance of the Royal Cambodian Ballet (Apsara Dance and Cultural Shows) complements well one's visit to Angkor. TIP 2: If I were to recommend, be sure to see and at least spend some time exploring Bayon, the terraces, Ta Prohm, Pre Rup, Banteay Srei, Sras Srang (after the repairs!), Prasat Kravan, Neak Pean, and Angkor Wat."

We visited Angkor Watt, Angkor Thom, the \"Jungle temple\" and the royal pavillion. All the sites were stunning, more so than can be imagined by looking at pictures or on TV. Our guide's name was Sokhom and he was amazing. Not only did he have an extensive knowledge of the temples, his life story was fascinating - from the aerial bombings during the Vietnam War, the \"Killing Fields\" era, the Vietnamese \"liberation\" from the Pol Pot regime and being conscripted into the army and finally returning to Cambodia to pick up his life again. After a lot of research we booked the trip with Urban Adventures on the web , and I'm very pleased we did. The price was very reasonable and included entry fee to the site and a very nice lunch in a local resturant in the park. The tour was comprehensive but not overly tiring. Be aware there is a reasonable amount of walking required and some of the steps on the temples are very narrow and quite steep. However, my wife who has a foot injury managed quite well.It's easy to see why this place is world heritage listed and is on so many people \"must do\" list.I highly recommend a visit and if you choose to book through Urban Adventures, be sure to ask for Sokhom as your tour guide."

This is a simply magnificent site and you need at least days to explore Angkor Thom, Angkor Wat and the rest. You can and should go on a guided tour or hire a guide to take you round, as that enables you to absorb so much more and to visit particular temples or carvings that you might otherwise miss. But the quality of the guides is mixed, even though they are licensed by the Cambodian Park authority. On our first morning we had a guide who could not engage adequately in the history, architecture and archaeology, and my wife, having read Lonely Planet, knew more than he did. We asked our hotel for a top guide, and for the next day and a half we had a magical, brilliant and informative experience. This is a fascinating man, just over 30 years old whose mother is Chinese and whose father (a Cambodian teacher who escaped death under Pol Pot) sent him away from his village to escape the Civil War; he became a Buddhist monk from 10 to 15 years old and was then accepted at an American sponsored orphanage in Phnom Penh. He is academically smart and knowledgeable, keeps up with the latest research, and speaks very good English. His name is Lach Kim Chhen, but everyone knows him as Kim. He has just set up a new business with some colleagues called Angkorpura Tour Guide Team, with a website under that name that is just going live and can be accessed through Google. Alternatively, you can email him at kim_angkortour@yahoo.com. I don't normally recommend particular guides or their businesses, but here the exception proves the rule.

(Hint: Ta Prohm, or the Tomb Raider temple, isn't at Angkor Wat - it's closer to Angkor Thom and it took us about 10 minutes by van to get there.)

If you want to experience what Siem Reap or Cambodia has to offer, go to the Angkor Archaeological Park. For you to access the Park, you need an Angkor Pass which can be bought at the Angkor Archaeological Park ticket booth which is a slight detour to the right en route to Angkor Wat. The Angkor pass will be checked at every temple's entrance so don't lose it. The Pass's price depends on the length of visit you want. $20 for 1 day. $40 for 3 days (nonconsecutive, valid for one week after purchase). $60 for 7 days (nonconsecutive, valid for one month after purchase). I always get my Pass punched at the ticket booth area. Remember to make sure the officer at the ticket booth area punches the correct date on your card. You might lose a day due to your and/or his/her oversight. Note that the pass does not include the temples, such as Beng Melea (entrance tickets being sold at the site for $5), Koh Ker (entrance tickets being sold at the site for $10), and Preah Vihear (entrance tickets being sold at the site for $10). In the Angkor Archaeological Park, if only have a limited time to visit, you SHOULD visit just three temples: Angkor Wat, Bayon, and Ta Prohm. Angkor Wat because it is the most massive of all religious sites in the whole world; Bayon because of theunique face towers; and Ta Prohm because of its ruinous state and the many tall trees which grow out from the ceiling, walls, and columns of the temple's structure giving a romantic and virgin feel to the temple. If you have some more time left of your limited time, go to Banteay Srei to view the beautiful pink stone carvings left mostly undamaged by time, nature, and humans. Banteay Srei is farther away and it takes almost a hour's ride from the cluster of temples at the Big Circuit and the Small Circuit and Angkor Thom, give or take. Visiting all four temples should take up a whole day's worth of sightseeing if you just have a day. If you just have half a day, best to view just Angkor Wat and Bayon. If you're in Cambodia for the first time, drop by Siem Reap even for a day to visit the Angkor Archaeological Park. It is definitely worth the journey to Siem Reap, and it is your highlight in your stay in Cambodia."

Rather than write separate reviews for each of the individual temples, I'll include them in this overall review of the park. You probably know there's an inner and outer loop through this park that includes a number of temples and of course, you don't want to miss any of them! Real talk: if you only have a couple of days, prioritizing your \"must see\" temples is your best bet. Cambodia: it's hot and humid, and hiking through temples all day WILL take a toll on you. We had two days and wanted some variety, so here's what we did:DAY 1Take a private car out to the park at 4:45AM (I know; don't be a baby), pay for your 3-day pass at the gate, and then stake out a spot along the pools in front of Angkor Wat; you WILL need a tripod. Shoot the fantastic colors and reflections as the sun slowly makes its way to the horizon. Once the sun has lit up the area, you're done; unless you want to take pictures of the hundreds of other people that are crowding around the same spot. Next, walk around to the rear of the temple and head in to explore Angkor Wat. Once you're finished, hop in your car and head to Sras Srang to eat breakfast; you can pack one or purchase some food from a vendor. When you're finished, head to Ta Prohm to explore the temple; don't be afraid to wander away from the groups of tourists just starting to arrive. After you finish exploring, you may want to consider grabbing a cold coconut from a vendor to help re-hydrate and make you feel fresh again; the Elephant Terrace and Banyan are next. It's late morning by now and the hordes of tourists are starting to flood into the temples; you'll have to navigate through them, but the shadows on the faces of the Banyan still look really nice at this time. Once finished, head back to Siem Reap for lunch and some AC recovery.The remainder of the afternoon to sunset, you should take your private car to Tonle Sap and the floating village. There are fees for the trip (~$30 total) and a bit of a journey across the countryside and river to the lake, but we thought it was well worth it. You'll get to see the lifestyle of the villagers and you can even take a canoe tour through the floating village and water forest; well worth it. End the day with watching the sun set over Tonle Sap before you take the journey back to Siem Reap.DAY 2Take a private car out to the park at 5:00AM (I know; AGAIN) so you can watch the sun rise over Sras Srang. Explore the Bantaey Kdei temple after the light has risen and then have breakfast. Hop in your car and head to Beng Mealea for some really cool temple exploration; the earlier you get there, the more likely you'll avoid seeing other tourists. There are guides that will escort you through the temples because you'll have to climb through rubble and find your way through dark hallways; you'll actually feel like you're exploring the ruins. After your finished, you can greet the tour buses of people as you're leaving. Enjoy the countryside on the drive back and feel free to stop for some bamboo-steamed sticky rice and beans; they're quite tasty.If you have an additional day, I'd say head back to the park to check out additional temples. Take your time, take advantage of the coconuts for hydration, and try to avoid the hordes; it's difficult, but doable..."

Clearly if you have your sites on this region you will probably have the classic Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Prohm and Angkor Thom on your must visit list. Just some advice to get the most out of your visit I would recommend hiring an accredited guide to take you through the various temples. They have cream coloured shirts with a badge verifying they are trained to show tourist through the temples. They will be able to show you the best temples, carvings and locations for photos. They will also know the history behind each temple and convey this. You can easily get a tuk tuk out there and wander around by yourself but for me you would miss so much unless you have some background in archaeology. There is also a good guidebook that you can get at the temple. It has a brown cover with colour pictures and detailed information on each ruin. It is easy to find as hawkers outside each site try to sell you a copy. Pay around US$5 for a copy.Personally you need at least three days to see the major ruins. Suggest you have a wish list prepared prior to arriving and discuss this with your guide. They will be able to best arrange making sure you can see as much as possible.Remember it is hot so take plenty of water, hat etc and be aware that there is some walking to do. There is really no wheelchair access available and you need to be reasonably fit to take on some of the more strenuous climbs. If you have the time try and visit some of the lesser known temples. Bantay Srei in my view is the best of them all as far as sophistication of the artwork and stone carving. Bantam Samrei is also a lesser known temple but you will be able to visit this without crowds and actually hear the birds in the background. If your'e lucky you may be able to hear some monks chanting in the distance. So make a wish list before you arrive, get an accredited guide to plan your itinerary( the extra cost is worth it), take plenty of water, leave at least three days to see the sites and don't forget some of the lesser known temples. These are the best. Enjoy!"

Big circuit can be done in half a day and so is the visite of the surrounding sites like Rolous group and banteay samre. Just hire a tuktuk for $ 12,- a day. There is a lot of walking and climbing inside the temples.If you visit cambodia you can not skip this place.(if you come from bangkok dont book the cheap (scam) tickets from khao san road !!!)"

We were picked up at 7.30am and returned at 4pm; hiring our tuk tuk and driver for $12 USD for the round trip. The drivers know the drill and for a one day visit will work around the petit circuit - we showed him on the map where we wanted to go and he took us. He also stopped a couple of places we hadn't planned on stopping at - one for monkeys on the side of the road, which was much appreciated and different points where he knew to get some good photos.The food inside them temples is on the expensive side ($5 for basic noodles) compared to restaurants in town, but they do have a captive audience and you will need to eat after a few hours of walking round the temples in the heat. Buy your water from the street sellers - large bottle of chilled water for $1 as opposed to $2 in the restaurants - it know it's only a dollar but as tesco say, every little helps.The child sellers are persistent and the teenagers from the restaurants near the lake can be quite aggressive when you say no, just be polite and keep moving.We thoroughly enjoyed our day but felt completely 'templed out' by the end of the petit circuit. If you have the time spread it over 3 days as we found we didn't appreciate the ruins at the end of the day the same way we did at the beginning which was a shame. It didn't stop me taking photos though - I went through 2 batteries throughout the day and filled 3gb of memory - take spares if you have them. We also downloaded a free app about the Angkor complex which provided us with information and insight that we wouldn't have had by simply walking round. Unfortunately a guide wasn't quite within our budget but the app provided enough info to keep us informed on our tour and we didn't feel we missed out by not having a guide."

I believe this is one of the cheapest priceless pleasures one can find nowadays. 40$ for three delightful days of sightseeing and experiencing these temples, each unique on their own, as old as 8th-century (Rolous group). How lucky we are that these temples are still there standing. As if they waited for us to behold their beauty and relive their stories. That amount we pay is probably for the wages of these locals working in the temples in the heat of the sun.What is 20 or 40USD? You go to Singapore and pay Universal Studios 60USD for just a single day of pleasure or 50USD for just a day of magical fun in Disneyland. If you are not into temples and ancient stuffs, Siem Reap is not for you. So we bought a 3-day ticket for 40$. In the morning we trekked Angkor Wat, then Sra Srang, Banteay Kdei, Ta Prohm, Ta Keo and lastly before lunch, Thommanon. In the afternoon we toured Angkor Thom: Terrace of the Elephants, Leper King, Phimeanakas, Baphuon & Bayon in that exact order. That completes the petite circuit temples on our day 1. On our day 2, we woke up at 4 am, left the hotel at 5 am, and reached Angkor Wat still dark but people already swarm the temple for the celebrated sunrise. We watched the sunrise by the reflecting pond, took photos & left the temple before 7. Then off we trekked the grand circuit temples. In the morning we were able to accomplish the grand circuit temples in the following order: Preah Khan, Neak Pean, East Mebon and Pre Rup. After lunch, we went to Banteay Srei, an hour drive from Siem Reap. An hour is enough to explore the exquisite Banteay Srei so we were able to get back to Siem Reap before 3pm. So we told our tuktuk to drop us to our hotel for a break & pick us up again at 4 to watch sunset at Phnom Bakheng. We enjoyed the elephant ride up the temple mountain.On last day of our 3-day pass, we left the hotel at 8 in the morning for the Rolous Group and visited the three temples in the following order: Bakong, Preah Ko and Lolei. Then we had lunch at Tell Steak in Old Market where I enjoyed my paborito carbonara. In the afternoon, we visited the Artisan Angkor with a cool guide, explored the Old Market for souvenirs and had frappe and croissant at a coffee shop at Lucky Mall\u2019s second floor. Get a 3-day pass. You go to Siem Reap to visit the temples so make the most of it."

We started out extremely early at 5AM so that we could see the Angkor Wat at sunrise. It was already breathtaking as it is, even if we went during the rainy season so the angle of the sun was not the best for photos. We booked David (Sovann Eath) as our tour guide. He had a car and free unlimited bottles of water, that is why we were able to go to all the attractions within the day in good time. Ta Prohm (the temple with the trees growing within them) was great in the morning. There was a somewhat ethereal or mysterious feeling about the place, like the temples and trees were alive. Another complex near the Angkor Thom gate is the one that houses the North & South Khleang, the Elephant Terrace, Phimeanakas, and the Terrace of the Leper King. All of these can be viewed within 2-3 hours. Each place was absolutely amazing - the wonder of the intricacies of the carvings on the walls and how the temples were built and laid out.A short distance away from this complex is the Bayon Temple. This is a magnificent temple that had two thousand faces. It is easy to tour because you just have to go around and around among the floors. Another main temple to visit is the Phnom Bakheng which is on top of a hill, and is recommended to be visited during sunset. Best to visit this during the dry season, because it rained when we visited and so we didn't really see the sunset, plus we got wet. We got to ride an elephant going up the hill though, and that was fun (also we were already tired by this time after going to all the other temples throughout the day). The day trip costs $20 entrance fee, plus our tour guide for $60 (good for the whole group already, includes aircon car transport and free unlimited bottled water) but I would say that the whole experience was priceless! Must-visit for anyone who wants to soak up some history and culture!"

Be sure to let your tut tut driver know whether you have a ticket or not as you have to get your picture taken for the pass which they do at the main ticket office. You DO have to show your pass at every temple, there are guards at the entrance to each, and they do really look at every pass carefully! We went for a leisurely approach and did Angkor Wat, and Angkor Thom as separate trips (partly due to the heat) (9-3pm each) and then another couple of days doing some of the smaller temples that were a bit more outlying. The distance between Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom is small... a few mins by tut-tut."

If its hot and with all the steps and walking around we wouldn't have wanted to then have to bike back to the town which we was told could be between 40-1 hour depending on your fitness.

Unfortunately the entrance to many of the temples is populated by hawkers who accost you from the minute you get out of your vehicle. Most of them are just annoying but a couple were quite unpleasant and I was glad I wasn't alone. Having said that, they are not allowed past the entrances so you are left alone to explore the temples"

Through our hotel we arranged to take a tuk-tuk for the \"Grand Tour\" (Big Circuit - so named because of the distance to be travelled between the temples) of five temples in the Angkor Archeological Park, including Banteay Srey, the \"Lady Temple\" (late 10th c Hindu). Since Banteay Srey was the temple farthest away, we began our tour there. When we reached Banteay Srey, also the hometown of our tuk-tuk driver, we stopped for a bit to meet his family and drink a young coconut with them, an unexpected bonus. Banteay Srey's relatively small size, pink sandstone construction, delicate almost filigree-like carving, and ornate design give it a surreal \u201cfairyland\u201d ambiance - incredibly beautiful, especially on a sunny day. Next on the list was East Mebon (late 10th c Hindu), a large temple-mountain-like ruin, rising three levels and crowned by five towers, dedicated to Shiva. It has beautiful, well-preserved elephant sculptures in each of the four corners, as well as two guardian lions at each of the four stair cases to the upper levels. From the topmost level we had a beautiful view out over the green and lush countryside beyond, some of which had not yet dried out from the recent mega-floods. Temple three, Ta Som (late 12th c Hindu), is a small monastic complex with beautiful carvings, a large gate topped by a stone portrait head, and is much like a smaller version of Ta Prohm, the \u201cAngelina Jolie Tomb Raider\u201d temple (as all the guides and tuk tuk drivers call it). Temple four, Neak Pean (12th c Buddhist), is a small island temple, the central building of which sits at the axis of a cross or lotus pattern of eight pools. Originally known as Rajasri, Neak Pean took its modern appellation, which means \u2018coiled serpents,\u2019 from the encoiled nagas that encircle the temple. The setting of this temple is beautiful but when we visited the area was still flooded; we accessed it along a wooden causeway over a lake boiling with mosquitos. After snapping a few pictures, we quickly made our way out again, me covered up with a sarong to avoid getting bitten. Finally, saving the best for last, we visited the magnificent Preah Khan (late 12th c Buddhist), a huge complex which originally served as a Buddhist monastery and school, engaging over 1000 monks. We approached the temple along a grand boulevard and bridge lined with gods and demons struggling, like the earlier bridge we\u2019d seen into Angkor Thom. Here only one head remains; the rest had all been eroded away. Once inside we were greeted with grey, green, and red walls sculpted with bas reliefs of apsara, warriors, firefly-Tinker Bell-like women along the top edges of inside walls, and huge fig and silk-cotton trees growing out of and into the building\u2019s stones.We didn't have a guide, just our tuk-tuk driver, and could spend as much or little time as we wished at each place. The driver also took us to an inexpensive local eatery near one of the temples and waited while we had lunch. At most of the temples food, drinks, and souvenirs are available for purchase. The Angkor temple pass is purchased at the Park entrance and costs $20 for a day, $40 for 3 days, and $60 for 7 days. Our tuk-tuk and driver cost $25. We did this trip without a guide; if you wish, one can be hired to go with you. We left our hotel just outside \"downtown\" Siem Reap at 8 am and were back by around 5 pm. Make sure you have lots of water, a hat, sunscreen, and mosquito repellent.This tour of Angkor Thom was incredible; the temples, and their setting in a large parklike area with beautiful enormous trees, are breathtaking. I have seen a lot - a lot! - of ruins, and this site ranks right up there with the best ever, a once in a lifetime spectacular must-do.

It is wetter so more humid. Benefit though is it is much greener and less dusty.Previously we hired a guide and did a one day tour. Very busy and exhausting. This time we bought a three day pass and hired a tuk-tuk driver. Allowed us to visit the sites in the morning while relaxing at the poolside in the afternoon. Much more relaxing way of doing it. The tuk-tuk option also allows you to feel much closer to the environment as you drive through sites. Initially I thought the lack of air conditioning would be a problem. Not at all dear reader, the breeze while driving on the tuk tuk is refreshing and has benefit of allowing you to dry off. Strongly recommend this.Benefit of coming in June is that there are not as many tourists. There is the possibility of afternoon downpours but these are shortlived and adds to the Asian experience.Love this place ..."

It encompasses more than 400 sq kms on the outskirts of Siem Reap and is a World Heritage Site.Passes to visit the site are sold in one day (US$20), three days (US$40) and seven days (US$60). The three day pass is valid for one week and the seven day pass can be used within the month and not necessarily consecutively. I suggest getting the three day pass to be able to enjoy the temples at a leisurely pace. It is also important to have the pass on you at all times as there are guards to inspect them at every temple before entry. Wear light airy clothes and proper footwear as it is hot and there are lots and lots of steps to climb. To enter the inner sanctum of the some temples one need to wear clothing that cover the knees and arms. Brings lots of water and mosquito repellent for the sunset tours. The temples are too far apart so it is impractical to walk. Tuk-tuks are cheap and even cycling can be an option. There are also elephant rides especially up Phnom Bakheng.Third trip to Angkor and it is still as magnificant and magical! Looking forward to my next visit."

There is just no place like this in the world. Everyone who thinks about going to Siem Reap knows about Angkor Wat. It is amazing and worth a couple hours at least, more if you want to follow the Ramayana epic in detail. However there are dozens (hundreds?) of other temples in the park. Spend some time reviewing a book about the many temples so you can plan out your day and minimize driving time. Some temples can be as much as a 45 minute drive by tuk tuk from the central Angkor Wat/Banyon temple area, but there are great ones some distance out. Dress appropriately as this these temples are still active places of worship (long pants for men). It's going to be hot, so wear comfortable shoes and cool fabrics (think seersucker, linen, or summer-weight cotton like madras). Drink plenty of water and a few ice cold coconuts."

Very nice and relaxing (make sure you take a lot of water- especially in May when it's really hot out!). When you get to the South gate of Angkor Thom you can go up onto the wall and following it along the outside wall of Thom. I saw maybe 4 people in total on the wall- so it's quiet and beautiful! I continued along the wall until the North gate, where I continued from there along the large circuit. Not much traffic on the roads so it was quite safe being on a bike.

Whole day.3) Sunrise at Angkor Wat, Banteay Srey -35 km North of Angkor Wat-,Kbal Spean -5 km North of Banteay Srey, and Big circuit (Preah Khan,Neak Pean,Ta Som, East Mebon, Pre Rup). Banteay Srey and Kbal Spean (a waterfall with stone carvings) are very different. Worth a visit. Also, whole day.It's very hot and humid, especially in March-May (when we went). We've been told that the good side of May is smaller crowds. Also, there's not a lot of rain.Tips for May.You have to walk a lot in the temples. The heat and humidity are tough on your body. My son lost 7 pounds and I lost 4 pounds. Tips: 1) Hire a car with A/C (around USD 30 per day, though for more than 1 day, you can get it down to USD 27-USD 25 range). You'll get to see more. In addition, the cars provide cold water for free.2) Go to Kbal Spean (the waterfall) and bring a swimsuit. Very refreshing.3) Drink a lot (a big bottle will cost you in the park USD .50. You need to bargain a little bit.)4) Bring white or clear shirts (you may need to change it during the day).5) Sunscream is a must.6) Bring and wear a good hat.7) There were not a lot of mosquitoes. But, just in case, bring a good repellent (15% deet or more).8) If you are not in decent physical shape, it may be a good idea to exercise before going there. I saw several exhausted people taking long breaks."

            "review": "Get cycling, get involved!. The Angkor complex really is top of the agenda for most people who come to Siem Reap and it can be overwhelming deciding what to see and what not if time is limited. Definitely, if you can, get a multi-day pass (3-day should be sufficient if you want to see lots but also spend good amount of time at each) and for the furthest away temples such as Banteay Srei arrange a tuk-tuk to take you there and you can stop off at the other temples along the way or even to say hi to the local farmers if you wish. If you do head to Banteay Srei don't forget to find the musicians often playing at the back of the complex - these people are all victims of landmines who are playing music to better their lives. And do not forget to stop off at the Landmine Museum ($3 entry). It is quite a small museum but well worth a visit for information on Cambodia's troubled past and a good example of a successful community project.The other days you should try to start early and go cycling. It is no doubt the best way to see the archaeological complex and to really engage with the environment - there is lots of opportunity to engage with the locals or make a stop to see monkeys, birds, snakeas along the way. You also notice a lot of the smaller, quieter temples if you cycle and get to really appreciate just how amazing this archaeological site is.Ta Phrom and the Bayon are probably most people's favourite temples: Ta Phrom is where Tomb Raider was filmed and really is a very romantic, awe-inspiring location where trees grow out of temples and just has a really ancient other-worldy feel about the place. The Bayon is a beautiful temple is surrounded in contemplative Buddha heads which form towers everywhere. However, any temple you visit should impress you.If you get hungry don't disregard the local food that is on offer at each of the sites. not only is the food reasonable but you can get the opportunity to sample a lot of local cuisine for a very good price particularly if you use the roadside stalls off of the main sites. If you are at Angkor Wat and fancy a refreshment then visit stall 94:Jastins and look out for the ladies selling scarves nearby too - these people are from the villages on the Angkor archaeological complex (you probably won't see or even notice these villages as they are tucked in and behind the jungle and off the road).These men and women are seriously just trying to make a wage to feed their families - so a $1 scarf that you might not need really can make a difference to people's lives."

Angkor Wat is great, but there are certainly other spots like Bayon, which are truly mind blowing. My number one suggestion to prospective visitors to Angkor Archaeological Park is to do your research. There's lots to see and you will likely have limited time. Siem Reap gets very hot and humid especially towards the middle of the day. Depending on your endurance and heat tolerance, you may decide to cut short your \"full day\" at the temples or else split your day to avoid the hottest times. You may also get Temple overload and require a break from touring.Consult multiple sources including this website, guidebooks, travel blogs, etc... Things that I think would be helpful to know:1) I recommend hiring a driver for approximately $25/day to take you around in a Camry. I've had friends who rented bikes and loved it. Others have rented tuk tuks (look it up). The roads are dusty. Short breaks in an air conditioned vehicle can extend the time you're willing to walk around in the heat. There are some worthwhile archaeological sites outside the park, which require a car to get to. This guy: Rous Kim http://www.taxiservice.comli.com/...treated us fairly, spoke English well, and was eager to talk about his country and its recent past. He also bought us some awesome local snacks. 2) There are officially certified guides who you can hire to personally show you around. Generally, you hire them separately from your driver. We did not hire a guide, and we sort of regret it. You can also haggle a cheap guide book from a vendor. Not the same. 3) Although Cambodia is one of the poorest nations in the world, we saw very few people begging for money. Kudos. Most people tried to sell us souvenirs or unofficial tour guide services. Do not fear, most \"vendors\" will allow you to view the ruins in peace and will not follow you into the archaeological sites. 4) For those reviewers who say they got \"scammed,\" at the most, they paid the price of a Happy Meal or two. You shouldn't have to pay more than the price of a Happy Meal for any ONE thing except for your hotel room, your driver, your guide, and goods/services at a place that accepts credit cards (e.g. fancy restaurants, nice spas).."

In comparison to the Incan, Mayan, and Aztec ruins, I didn't find anything at Angkor that was individually as mind-blowing, but the sheer scale of the ruins guarantees that there will be something that touches everyone. We decided to spend four days in Siem Riep, and bought a 3-day ticket to Angkor. They are smart about the pricing because I think most people would be satisfied with what they could easily visit in two days, but it was nice to not be rushed.On our first day, we took a Tuk Tuk out to Kbal Spean and hit the outlying elements of the large circuit on the way back. This was nice to get perspective.On the second day we rode bikes to Angkor Wat and started off there. I was initially disappointed that I wasn't blown away when I walked in the entrance. Maybe it was the green covering they have up for restoration, or maybe it was the fact that I wasn't yet in the right mindset. We spent the rest of the day walking the small circuit which ended up being much more difficult than we had expected. At the end of the day we came back upon Angkor Wat from the back, as the sun was about to set, and then it was truly breathtaking. No crowds, no green tarp, just a quiet magnificence. Like hiking to Macchu Pichu, maybe part of the experience is making a pilgrimage and suffering a bit before you see the structure.On the third day we rode back to Angkor Wat to see the middle section which was closed the previous day. That is worth standing in line for. Then we rode out to the Roluos Group which wasn't a nice ride on the highway nor were the ruins too spectacular having already seen the rest of Angkor. Maybe a better idea would be to split up our second day into two days for the 3-day ticket holders."

As suggested in many travel books, we visited the complex after 5pm to see the sunset after purchasing a ticket for the following day.On entering the temple area, we were accosted by two young men who started talking to us about the carvings on the walls. This was a scam! Beware of being 'accompanied' by helpful 'students' who only wanted to tell you more about the site but then demanded money for their services as 'guides'. We felt very threatened by this as they said that unless we paid them they would be arrested by the police. One (possibly an evening security guard with a walkie talkie radio) asked for $20 to allow us to go to the highest tower as it was not officially open. We declined. This practise of preying on unsuspecting tourists should be stopped as it spoils the pleasure of visiting such magical surroundings.After our poor first experience, on visiting the temples on the following day, they were all absolutely amazing. Our tuk tuk driver took us from one temple to the next and, having started out from the hotel at 5am to see the sunrise, we had seen most of the big temples in the group by lunchtime and had a pleasant, cooling drive to one of the furthest out of the temples. This had a much more touristy feel than the others but was equally as stunning. Amazingly, they are all so different but all magical in their own way. It was a visit I had always wanted to make and I was not disappointed!"

No book or photo can aptly or adequately capture or describe the breath-taking vastness, awe, and wonderment of this World Heritage cultural site. (Strongly recommend \"Ancient Angkor\" by Claude Jacques and Michael Freeman) We had read that people take hundreds, even thousands, of photos and we thought we could show restraint. We, too, ended up taking over 1,000 photos over the six days. A celestial apsara here, another apsara there... a 7-headed serpentine naga here; another naga over there... long corridors of bas-reliefs depicting battles; elaborately carvings; trees and vines growing out of stone; some temples in ruin and rubble, others amazingly still standing a thousand years later. The typical organized tours of SE Asia usually only allow a day or two, but that is NOT enough time for full appreciation of the splendor of the Angkor complex. One truly needs a minimum of 3-5 days to do justice... Schedule a couple of day trips to the outlying temples, including and especially Beng Melea. One would think that after you've seen one temple, you've them all. Not true. Each temple has its own unique character: Angkor Wat with its quincunx structure; Beng Melea, truly the \"Jungle\" temple; Bayon, the serene temple with huge stone Buddha images facing north, south, east west; Ta Prohm of Lara Croft-Tomb Raider fame with trees and vines growing out of the stone structures; Banteay Srei, aka the \"Citadel of Women\" with elaborately carvings in the pink stone; too many to describe. We hired a private car and driver for Beng Melea some 40 miles outside Sie Reap. For other outlying temples and structures, we booked with VillaSiemReap.com (which coordinates with BeyondUniqueEscapes.com). This well-run company limits the group to 8 people. For the two tours we took with them, there were only 4-5 people --it was just as good as having the private guide and driver for the Beng Melea trip. The visits to Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and the outlying temples were THE highlight of our month-long trip to SE Asia (Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore). Because of the heat and humidity, some parts can be physically demanding due to lots of climbing, especially over uneven stone steps and rubble. But we saw people with walkers and canes bravely taking one step at a time. Inspiring! Carry PLENTY of water. The heat cannot be understated (and we went during the \"cool\" time.) There are mosquitos, especially in the outlying areas. Bring plenty of Deet. Long-sleeve light-colored cotton shirts, as well as mosquito nets to cover the face, offer protection from sun and mosquito bites. We found Johnson's OFF clip-on fan-circulated mosquito replellent to be relatively effective -- mosquitos swarmed around other people. Occasionally we would hear an aggressive mosquito zing by us."

Overall Angkor is one of those must-see places, but be prepared for Disneyland in Cambodia, because you have thousands of tourists planning to see the same sights.

Despite the guidebooks recommendations, one day was enough at Angkor for us (& for our wallets)."

The tour busses arrive mid-morning and all the sellers trying to get you to buy stuff arrive then too. It is also really hot by then.

If you are into ancient architecture, this is a must visit; if you have to choose between the temples in South East Asia, this definitely rank one of the highest. It is really difficult to not awe and gawk at the sheer size of the temples, built not with modern machinery. We visited in February, when the weather is hot. The ground is dusty and at the end of the day, our sunblock-laden feet was covered with a layer of dusty gunk. But we still prefer the hot weather to the rainy season, all the better to visit the open sites without having to worry whether it would rain or not. Do bring a cap and sunglasses in this hot season. Face mask -- to cut out the dust breathed in -- is optional.We took the 3-day pass (USD40) based on the recommendation that a 1-day pass was definitely too short to see many of the temples. Would recommend to hire a local guide when visiting this place to (a) support the local tourism industry, and, (b) so that the buildings do not merge and become one and the same in your mind, after hearing the stories behind the intricate carvings. Our guide speaks English, and the cost to hire this guide and a tuk-tuk driver was reasonable. Do message me for his contact details.The only drawback is the many peddlers selling souvenirs outside the temples. An effective method to not let this bother you is to smile and say \"No, thank you\" and continue walking your way. Any attempt to touch/feel their wares for sale would mean an interest in purchasing them, which leads to constant harrassment until you are out of their sale zone boundary. Any attempts at purchasing would draw more peddlers in your direction."

The Park is easily experienced via so many transportation options it makes for an enjoyable destination whether you're a tourist, flashpacker, and backpacker. The price tag may seem steep on a backpacker budget but its well worth making the sacrifice to purchase the 3-day pass in order to properly Explore the rich history of this ancient city. Having visited both Angkor and Bagan in Myanmar I feel that Angkor edges Bagan only marginally. With the temples at Angkor being larger, utilizing more impressive architecture, and more offer detail in their bas-reliefs. On the other hand, Angkor's size makes it impossible to get an elevated perspective without some kind of aerial transportation.The people hawking drinks, meals and wares, while aggressive competitive, are actually very sweet and nice. The only negative experience we had here was with the park security and ticket checkers. These people were consistently rude even when we tried to be nice to them. They rarely smiled, often made jokes about the tourists. In one case, one of the security guys had a young son (maybe 7-8 years old) who was peddling post-cards to tourists complaining that he had no family even though he was actually dressed very well. We watched him repeat his same story from tourist to tourist then walk back to his dad, jump up on his moped and answer questions before jumping off to chase down a new batch of tourists. At another temple the police officer was trying to get tourists to buy from a lady set-up inside the temple. I can accept that corruption is a way of life in Cambodia but its still a little disheartening to see it occur so blatantly at such an important site. The rude behaviour of the other staff should be unacceptable. We had one guy tell us to go complain if we had a problem with his attitude but of course there is no place to really file a complaint. Angkor is one of those sites that everyone should visit even if its the only place you visit in Cambodia. I suggest just being polite to the staff and otherwise ignore them or pretend you don't understand them. Cheers and happy travels."

Whilst it may be the iconic towers of Angkor Wat adorning the postcards and guidebooks, there\u2019s a lot more to the Angkor Archaeological Park than one famous temple. Located six kilometres north of Siem Reap in northern Cambodia, the Angkor Archaeological Park \u2013 a UNESCO World Heritage Site \u2013 is one of the most important archaeological sites in South-east Asia.We were surprised to discover that the ancient city of Angkor offers more than one thousand temple ruins and monuments over an area of 400 square kilometres, and is a photographer\u2019s paradise.We had read some information about visiting the major temples in the reverse of the usual order taken by coaches and tuk-tuks. This proved to be valuable advice, not only for better photographs (because of the position of the sun relative to the temples) but we also remained one step behind or ahead of the crowds (depending on the time of day), often finding ourselves entirely alone in shaded courtyards, free to explore Angkor\u2019s secrets. Amongst our favourite temples were Bayon, the spectacular central temple of the ancient city of Angkor Thom, with it\u2019s many carved stone faces ; Ta Pronh, largely left to the clutches of the living jungle and where, at any moment, you might expect to see Indiana Jones come leaping out at you ; and Banteay Srei, the \u201cCitadel of Women\u201c where, it is said, that the reliefs on the temple are so delicate that they could only have been carved by the hand of a woman .  One modern engineer has estimated it would take 300 years to complete the building of Angkor Wat today \u2013 yet the monument was begun soon after King Suryavarman II came to the throne in the early 12th century, and was finished shortly after his death, thus taking no more than 40 years to complete.

It was still dark when I arrived and I hadn't thought to bring a flashlight along but this wasn't a problem as many other people had lights and provided I walked carefully over the uneven path way it was easy to make my way to the lake in front of Angkor Wat. Some enterprising kids had laid out mats on the edge of the lake that you were welcome to use provided you bought some tea of coffee from them for 2 dollars. Sitting on the mat right a the edge of the lake watching the sky lighten and the reflection of Angkor Wat start to appear on the lake really was worth the early start. It was totally mystical. I then set off to explore the temple while it was still really quite which was amazing. This was followed by a wonderful encounter with a troop of wild monkeys playing near the temple. Finally I got to watch a truely stunning sunrise over the temple. All in all an experience not to be missed."

In 3 days time you can get a good overview of the Khmer history as it is related to these temples built during the Angkor era. If you have traveled 11,000 miles, half way around the globe to see temples in Cambodia, make sure you plan your days so that you have enough time to appreciate everything you can come into contact with. If you mix and match your activities you wont get \u201cTemple Fatigue\u201d and will appreciate what you came to see and learning about. I would also recommend a good guide. The guide our hotel arranged was a certified guide by the government. Our guide, En Sophal, had a great sense of humor and spoke better English than some of my fellow Americans! Not only was Mr. Sophal a walking encyclopedia for all things Angkor, but he knew of the most interesting photo opportunities using temple architecture and camera position to create some really impressive optical illusions. A good guide will also try and time your visits away from the times that the big buses are coming through. I would recommend getting an early start each day since it is much cooler in the morning hours. At the beginning of each day I would give my guide a list of the temples I wanted to see for the day and he would arrange the order so that we had the best opportunity to see these temples and not get trampled by the hordes of bus tours. It was nice to have some great photos with temples that look empty.Keep in mind that you are in the jungle and it gets hot so keep bottled water handy. It was really nice riding by Tuk Tuk through the forest between temples and enjoying the breezes and awesome scenery. If you intend to visit Beng Mealea, keep in mind there is a separate entrance fee of $5 and this temple is over 1 hour away by CAR. Since the tickets you purchase run consecutive days only, you can save that one for one those days that is not included in your 3 day pass. Angkor Park is an experience that you will never forget. There is something magical about it that feels very spiritual and stays in your heart long after you have left."

You need at least 2 days to see enough of it, don't get a single day ticket unless you really won't get a chance to come back. A tuktuk driver was organised for us by the guesthouse -which we didn't expect- but a good thing it was, the complex is huge and he knew his way around and had a nice little plan \"for us\". Would have been impossible by foot. Ankor Wat itself was a little overrated, although very beautiful. I enjoyed some of the smaller temples more. The sunrise was nice, was the first time I had ever been in a crowd that gathered specifically for that. The crowd didn't bother me, you just need a little space for yourself with a nice view. It didn't bother me too much but some of the temples have extremely steep stairs. Going up one of them (don't remember the name but it's recommended for sunsets) was ok but coming down was terrifying. Much like a crowd going down a tall, eroded stone ladder. The only thing I hated was the begging and harassment. Not like I can blame vendors for trying -and using their kids to chase down customers. We were constantly bombarded by vendors and children for money. They can also get very rude or emotional if you don't give them anything, they are very intent on making the sale and they are absolutely everywhere. They will follow you. If not interested just politely decline and keep walking. It's just something you have to deal with. The youngest was a little girl, not yet 3 years old, trying to sell us some handicraft. Remember that Siem Riep is the biggest and one of the only tourist attractions in Cambodia and ticket money does not stay in the country (foreign ownership). People come from poor villages all over the country to make a buck there... it's cheap anyway so go ahead and spend a few bucks on food/drink/souvenirs once there...on the other hand, you have to be able to decide regardless of how someone may approach you, otherwise you'll spend all your money out of pity (as well as encourage kids not to stay in/go to school). Female monks (not sure if there's another word for that) apparently there for praying are seated in the temples and will force incense candles into your hand, or insist by gestures that it's rude if you don't light a candle. Whatever the case, they want a dollar. If you go to Ankor Wat for sunrise, expect someone to start chatting with you and give you some information. They are the restaurant workers trying to secure a deal for later. Don't worry about the difference between restaurants, they are all the same. Make sure that if you get something you go to the same person, they will be extremely offended if you go to someone else. They will ask if you remember them from earlier and lead you to their restaurant... go ahead with them, they are really hoping that you come with them and it's not like it's feasible to look around and compare menus or prices. These guys don't harass you too much, and hey, you will need a coffee or good breakfast to set you up for the long day ahead."

I recommend hiring a tuk-tuk driver for half a day, from early in the morning until lunchtime, then going back home and taking a rest from the heat. You can buy a three-day ticket for $40 and see a lot, almost everything. We spent a good amount of time at each temple area, but the most pleasant time was early in the morning before it got hot and before the tour buses arrived. It truly is worth it to hire a tuk-tuk driver (between $15-$25 per day), because he knows where he is going and there is a lot of distance between many of the temples. You can rent bikes, but I only recommend that if you are a biking fan and ready to get a bit lost and quite sweaty.There are plenty of bathroom facilities that are kept up nicely throughout the Park, and lots of little restaurants catering to tourists."

The highlights are easy to name : Angkor Wat, The Bayon, Ta Prohm etc..but sometimes its the little temples, the slightly off the beaten track ones that take you by surprise. We visited one called Thomannon and it was wonderful, small, compact, fantastic reliefs and carvings and in a lovely setting.So go with an open mind, pace yourself, remember that there will be (I hope) other opportunities in life to come back and see some more. I count myself fortunate to have visited many of the so-called wonders of the world during my travels, I am sure others have done the same, but the archaeological park is right up there nd believe me, theres much more to it than simply Angkor Wat.

This is a premier league destination and is up there with all the great places that I have visited anywhere in the world. Here are a few tips that will help you get the most enjoyment from your visit.1. Get up early and enjoy these fantastic monuments alone; the park opens at 5:30, but is usually over run by coach loads of tourists by 9. You can get 3 or 4 hours of quality site seeing before returning to your hotel for a late breakfast and the rest of the hot day relaxing. 2. Get a good guide, who will give you far more information than you will ever get from a book.. This is the best way to use your time at the sites most effectively.3. Pace yourself; there is a lot to see, and if you do 8 hours of sites per day, for day after day, you will soon be exhausted and \"templed out\". If your itinerary allows, have a break from the temples and do something different such as horse riding at Happy Ranch or go to Bodia Spa (both recommended by me). 4. Three days will let you see most of the main temples. If you are staying for more than 3 days, I recommend that you buy the pass that allows you to spread your three days site seeing over a week. This costs the same as the 3 consecutive day pass ($40), but is much more flexible. You have to go to the two kiosk windows on the left handside of the entrance plaza to get the 3 day in a week passes. If you go to any of the other windows you will be sold 3 consecutive days. 5. I can recommend our guide, Mr Pech Mony, whose telephone number I publish with his permission. You can contact Mony on local cell phone number 012 898694."

You are then issued with a photo ID pass that you have to show every time you enter the park or a temple.

You don\u2019t come to Siem Reap to not see the temples! A must see at least once in your life. Some other notes about Siem Reap here too!You will see all kinds of things in the park, elephants walking around, and it is the main area which is just outside Angkor Thom, Angkor Wat, the Terrace of the Elephants, etc. It\u2019s an open area.Some note about Cambodia I will post here.Do you need mosquito spray? Well, you might, you might not. We brought it, only used it in the jungle temple. But we also wore long sleeve light colored clothing. I got bit once the entire three days we were in Siem Reap. My wife got bit 3 times because she rolled up her sleeves. We went in December. There are mosquitoes in the bathrooms, but other places I didn\u2019t see many. We saw people walking around in shorts and T-shirts, we thought, hmmm, ok, those folks are putting themselves at risk, but then again maybe not, it depends on where you go and when you go. I also bought a bunch of citronella patches and wore at least 1-2 on my back, hat, etc. it kept them away. But again this was December.Food, mostly is fine, we didn't get sick, just make sure things are cooked through, and use common sense.Our guide: http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d2178241-Reviews-Thoeunson_Private_Tour-Siem_Reap.htmlI think a 3 day pass cost us $30-40 bucks, can\u2019t remember off hand.There are some people who visit Angkor Wat who don\u2019t respect the temples or understand things. There was one guy just in front of us who asked his guide why they don\u2019t cut down all the trees around the Tomb Raider Temple. I just about collapsed. If you cut down the trees, no one will come, this is part of the beauty of Angkor Wat! Why would want to cut down the trees? Some people just can\u2019t understand nature\u2019s value. Please respect the temples and the grounds, period. Also you will see many landmine victims playing instruments to some of the temples, feel free to give them a few riel, the poor guys risked their lives to try to remove these things or accidently stepped on one on their farm and now can\u2019t work and support their families.However, you will also encounter people attacking you and following you to try to sell you something just in and out of the temples. These people are annoying, though I understand their plight to support their families, however, when children are doing it, I feel it\u2019s not good, they should be in school. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM. Once they get a taste of money they will feel why go to school. Do not support them. Talk to them in English, say hi, and then ask them why they are not in school and tell them how fun it is to be there. Maybe one day it will sink in, or they will pressure their parents to let them go, I don\u2019t know. Either way don\u2019t buy from these folks. It gets old and boring after awhile being attacked by them, but be nice. Just remember if you do decide to buy something be forewarned, you will be trapped and others will expect you to buy as well. If there is something you really want to buy you can buy it downtown in Siem Reap at one the souvenir stores, ask your guide or driver to take you there or ask the hotel to tell you where it is. The prices are exactly the same and in this way you are supporting the economy not just one person. Giving to the people here, especially the kids does more harm than good as the kids should be in school. I want to mention something important there. Under no circumstances should you buy something from a police officer! If you are with a guide, they could get in trouble for it. While at Banteay Srei I was approached by a police officer, and he said, \u201cHey, do you want to buy a genuine police badge, I had highly considered buying it, however, I knew better and politely refused him immediately, I never even looked at it or approached him, I just said no thank you and kept walking. I think it would have been nice to have, but the police officer risks losing his job and our guide would have risked going to jail or get fined. Our guide told us later that if I had bought it, that same police officer may have approached him afterwards and said your customers stole it from him or blah blah blah. It would have not been a good thing. So don\u2019t buy anything you know you shouldn\u2019t have. I laugh at it now, but it could have been quite serious would I have really bought it.At one of the temples, and now I cannot remember which one it was, but on top of one of them you can see Angkor Wat in the distance and some of the other temples from the top. However, beware, there may be a guy up on top that will try to point these out to you and then ask for a small payment. If you can see Angkor Wat at all from the top it will be very small, you will only see a few of the towers in the distance between the trees. You can also see some other temple tops over the trees here. You can probably try to find them by yourself if you have a map with you. If the guy tries to help you politely tell him immediately that you have a guide and that you know you can see Angkor Wat from the top. Sorry again I forgot which temple this happened at, I just remember the temple being surrounded by trees and the view was spectacular."

Today Cambodia's second major city, it is small and walkable. (Cambodia's total population of 14 million, is less than that of Mumbai city.) It is a beautiful little city, well laid out, clean, and with no population pressures.Siem Reap's main attractions are its ancient temples, many of them in the Angkor Archaeological Park - a UNESCO World Heritage site - but also widely distributed elsewhere. By far the biggest attraction is the awesome, 12th century Angkor Wat, which had started off as a Hindu temple, dedicated to the God Vishnu, but was later remodelled as a Buddhist temple, which it is to this day. Angkor was the capital of the Khmer empire from 5th to 12th centuries AD, and at one time had a million people. Set up on a one sq-km site, Angkor Wat is the largest religious structure of any type in the world, and was the state temple at Angkor.Angkor Wat is exceptionally well preserved - as good as though it was built yesterday - thanks to continuing conservation and maintenance. The temple has five huge, intricately-carved towers - four at the corners of its rectangular base, and the fifth, towering over the others to a height of 65 m, at the centre. It is an awesome sight, that becomes increasingly so as one approaches. Of particular interest are the very intricate and well-preserved bass reliefs about Hindu mythological epics as well as Angkor's wars with its neighbours. You will need a guide to explain these epics and historical events. Your trip should be of at least four days, with two to three days for the temples alone - by taxi, tuk-tuk or even a hired bicycle. The distances are not walkable. It is best to concentrate on the best temples. Bayon is best noted for its emormous faces carved in stone. The Banteay Srey temples - intellectual gems - are small, but have the most intricate - and exquisite - carvings. Tenth century Phnom Bakheng , the first major temple at Angkor, marks the shift of the capital from Rolous to Angkor. Preah Khan is an ancient Buddhist monastery with multiple, chriss-crossing passages and intricate carvings. Ta Prohm, another monastery, is also an architectural wonder, and is being ably restored by Indian archaeologists. Restoration work on a massive scale has also been undertaken by European archaeologists at a number of temples. There is a lot else to do in Siem Reap. Visit the well-maintained National Museum, that beautifully highlights the history and culture of Cambodia - as does the Cambodian Cultural Village. The Toul Sieng Genocidal Museum is a grim reminder of Khmer Rouge bestiality against their own people. The Angkor Shopping Centre specialises in gems and jewellery. Artisans de Angkor offers visitors a free tour of their stone and wood carving facilities, and sells high-quality handicrafts. Traditional handicrafts of the region can be had at the Asian Crafts Centre. Do not miss the Old Market and Night Market for some amazing souvenirs. You can even have rides on elephant back, in hot air balloons and in helicopters. Siem Reap offers an altogether amazing trip.One request.Many of the people are very poor. Dear little children, some well below ten years of age, eke out a living selling books on Angkor Wat, a range of souvenirs and picture post cards - the latter for ten to the dollar Do buy all you can, and do not bargain too hand with them. It is their only source of livelihood."

Angkor is so much more than just Angkor Wat, which seems to be the only Angkor-era temple that many people have heard of. There are about 100 temples of Angkor, each about 1,000 years old. Many appear to be mountains of stone rising above the semi-tropical trees and rice fields of northwestern Cambodia. The greatest concentration of these temples reside in the Angkor Archaeological Park, which is several kilometers north of the tourist hub city of Siem Reap.The most popular temples in the park are Angkor Wat, The Bayon with its 216 giant, carved, smiling faces, and Ta Prohm, with giant trees growing out of its walls. But there are many other temples of note, including red-stoned Banteay Srei, which is north of the main temple area, Pre Rup, Preah Khan, Banteay Kdei, and others.The best ways to visit the temples are by bicycle or in a tuk tuk, which is a rickshaw-like vehicle that is pulled by a motorbike. If it's very hot or you're not in good enough condition to bicycle long distances, then the tuk tuk is probably your best bet. You leave the driving to someone else, and you can tell the driver to go at whatever speed you want and to stop wherever you want. Whichever way you visit the temples, bring a camera, walking shoes, sunglasses, a wide-brimmed hat, and plenty of water. You can buy food at the many restaurants within the park.You may also want to hire a knowledgeable guide. One that I got to know is named Kinal MIn, who speaks excellent English, is very knowledgeable about the temples as well as Cambodian culture, and can give you good tips about where to stay and eat in Siem Reap.I recommend spending at least 3 days visiting the temples. A 1-day pass to the park costs $20, but a 3-day pass costs $40. An even better deal is the 7-day pass, which costs $60. Of course, you may want to visit the temples with a tour guide on your first day, just to get yourself oriented and educated, and then visit the temples on your own on subsequent days. Tour guides and tuk tuk drivers charge very reasonable prices."

We had the excellent luck to find a driver who was polite and highly knowledgeable.
