The Palace Bridge, closest to our hotel, was supposed to have the added feature of classical music and lights until the end of September, so I made my way out there for the 1:25 AM opening. Maybe it was where I was positioned, but I heard no music, but the bridge was raised right on time. Impressive to a degree, and I'm glad I did it and took pictures and video, but I won't need to lose sleep to do it again. ."

The opening of the palace bridge is beautiful with lights and music. There are 2 ways to enjoy the attraction - 1) Stand on the road adjoining palace bridge (which is the most beautiful one); or 2) Take a night time cruise which covers opening of all the bridges. On a rainy day, prefer option 1 given it can get cold and windy on the cruise (we learnt the hard way). On a clear day, cruise would be better as it is a nice way to enjoy the city view in the night. Couple of pointers:1) Ensure you are on the same side of the bridge as your hotel. Else you will be stuck till 5 on the wrong side.2) Figure out a way to reach back late night to your hotel. Taxis will fleece you if they figure out you are a tourise."

If you come to St. Petersburg, you will be crossing this bridge several times to move between the Palace Square (Hermitage and Winter Palace) and the sights on Vasilevskiy Ostrov. This bridge is a 20th century creation and is probably one of the most famous sights of St. Petersburg. The height was limited so as to not obstruct the view of the monuments around it. There is a draw bridge to allow ships to pass up the Neva River. The history of Palace Bridge dates back to 1901, they had a competition to design a permanent bridge. This was no easy feat \u2013 it took eight years for them to decide a winner. The winner was Andrey Pshensitsky, a recent graduate of the St. Petersburg Institute of Communications Engineering. Celebrated Art Nouveau designer and artist Roman Meltzer was commissioned to design the bridge's architectural decorations, and construction eventually began in 1912. Free"

The cruise boat started around 00.30 am and the bridges were started being drawn open at around 01.30 am one by one. The scene was thrilling.The cruise boat had partly fully covered sitting area and smaller part being open to sky. The problem is the crowd in the boat. They jostled for space in the open area for pictures and it was really ugly experience. Why can not people be more disciplined ? Irrespective of nationalities this is an issue to solve.The boat had some outdoor chairs in the open space but the travellers ignored it and some stood on it.But this does not take away from the fantastic show being unravelled. The few kilometres cruise to see the bridges being drawn open is really cool.It was about an one hour show in the dark night. The buildings at the shores both side were fantastic view with lighting.Reccommended show when in St. Petersburg,one of the greatest and most beautiful cities in the world."

This is usually done at night so as not to interrupt the flow of traffic. Being on a cruise ship with a group visa, we did not have the opportunity to see the bridge open, but even during the day time, it is a busy, exciting bridge."

That is a bridge we often used to cross on the other side of Bolshaya Neva River, on the Vasilievsky Island.It connects Palace Square and a greatest island of 42 islands in total having on Neva River. By the way Neva river is by the volume of the water one of the largest in Europe but by length one of the shortest ,only 74 km.The bridge is the road traffic and foot bascule bridge with five spans.Walking late in the evening one day on the Palace Embankment between Winter Palace and Admiralty, we saw the operation of drawing(basculing) the bridge, after what all traffic across Neva to the Vasilievsky Island interrupted.Before the current structure and design of the cast-iron bridge, the same was temporary pontoon bridge but set about 50 meters downstream from the nowadays position.Great bridge and wonderful views from it on the both coast of Neva River !"

I wasn't expecting much but it was actually very cool to see all the bridges opening. They are lit in a cool way and are very beautiful to see. Quite romantic if you are with someone. Then the boats come through and you get to watch them. If you are there during summer like I was, it is relatively light all night so you can take a walk back through the main squares or by the cathedrals afterwards. Highly recommend."

Not only it separates the city center from the island, University and Kunstkamera but it plays a huge role in lives of those living on that tiny island by the sea. During the summer navigation period, it is open each night, making it impossible to get from one part of the city of another. To me, it depicts perfectly the old St. Petersburg, during the summer times, when you spend you night walking outside in between the cathedrals and parks waiting to cross over. The architecture of the bridge is beautiful, too and you get a nice view on the Fortress of Peter and Paul."

Completed only in 1916, 15 years after the competition that took 8 years to choose the winning designer, this was the first bridge to break Peter the Great\u2019s embargo on building bridges over the Neva in the city he had created. It joins Palace Square with the historic area of Vasilevsky Ostrov. Comprising 5 cast-iron spans resting on granite pillars, and sitting very low above the water, it presents a fairly functional appearance that to some extent contrasts with its opulent surroundings, although a certain amount of decorative work in the form of iron railings, lamp-posts, monumental lions\u2019 heads and pavilions were added only just before the onset of WWll. I did not manage to see the central span open for the passage of boats ------ an event that is said to frame the glorious cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul between its two halves that rise to an angle of 45 degrees. It certainly makes a major contribution to the flow of traffic in this city without disrupting navigation by river, and is a dramatic sight although neither truly beautiful or memorable."
