Took approximately 30 minutes and provided either an open ride on the upper deck, air conditioned lower deck and the ability to have a cocktail while enjoying the ride. Neat to see Cruise ships in passing!"

The ride was way smoother. On the ride home we all had headaches and wnated to hurl! Ultramar had a fun badn to entertain us, the ride was outdoors so we really got to experience that beautiful turquoise sea and they had snacks, drinks and beer for not too much money. Wiould use them again. Buy your tix from the booth and not the people trying to \"help you\" down the sreet"

They said it was the newest and fastest boat however Caribe left on time and got to Cozumel on time.Coming home the waters were extremely bad, the wind was blowing and the swells were no doubt about 6-8ft high. The boat was rocking and alot of people were seasick. The Caribe left on time as well, this ferry did not."

We purchased tickets in a hurry at 12:30pm because we were told by the representative at the stand that the next ferry left in an hour (1:30pm). After we purchased the tickets we drove 7-8 minutes to the dock to find out that the next ferry does not leave until 3pm. Their company office is approximately 20 feet from the dock and therefore I walked to the office and requested to speak to somebody. Their best offer to a solution was they could refund me half of the money for our ride to Cozumel (and could use a different company) but that we had to return with them (UltraMar). I continued to ask for a full refund and they stated I had to go back to the stand I purchased the tickets at, I refused to walk that distance to receive a refund and miss the next ferry at 2pm (time offered by a different company). We were able to convince them to send a representative to us and we needed them to arrive quickly but they took their time. It was not until 2:30pm they decided to give us a refund, and I took the money and purchased the next ferry at 2:45pm from a different company. When we finally arrived at Cozumel at 3:45pm we found all the beaches were closed at 5pm. We only got a chance to eat and returned back to Playa del Carmen after the sunset and it was dark. We lost the day and sunlight due to this company not providing proper service. DO NOT USE THEM!!!"

It could use some more clearly marked English language signs for the majority of the visitors to direct you to the correct locations and for the time tables. Otherwise, a couple of shops for refreshments and other travel goods. Great place to people watch if you got a little extra time on your hands or for a quick nap in my case after scuba diving all morning off Cozumel. The actual ferry was in great condition and plenty of seating for all the passengers. Does get busier in the evening compared to morning departures."

We decided to take the ferry over to visit them one day. My wife doesn't exactly love being on big boats because she gets motion sick. We decided to sit on the middle deck which is outdoors. Much to our surprise they offered snacks and drinks (for an additional fee of course) and a full band playing really good music. All of this kept her mind off of being on the boat and made it an enjoyable trip for both of us. I would highly recommend this ferry company over the other two options."

We didn't notice it until we reached the bus station where we had intended to take the Airport Bus to Cancun. We panicked and rushed back to the boat which was just about to return to Cozumel. My wife explained what happened to the person who was supervising the boarding. He graciously allowed my wife to run down to the boat to search for her wallet. As she rushed to the boat he called the captain on the radio to ask for some time and help. Once my wife boarded the ship she looked in vain for the wallet. Tears came to her eyes as she realized that it must be lost. Then almost miraculously a crew member descended from the bridge with the lost wallet. One of the crew members apparently found it and immediately took it to the captain for safe keeping. We can't thank the captain and crew enough for their kindness and help. We enjoy scuba diving on Cozumel several times a year and part of the fun is the ferry ride. It's amazing to us how friendly and nice the people are in this area. We feel so comfortable and welcome. Thank you so much for making our vacation a memorable one. We love you! Steven & Katherine"

Another option is to take the R-1 bus to downtown Cancun and board a combi (little van, at a nominal cost, for the rest of the way to Puerto Juarez). At Puerto Juarez, exit at the first stop, walk through the huge parking ramp, to find the ticket office for the Ultra Mar ferry. They do not accept charge cards. There is an ATM machine there if you don't have pesos. Taking the ferry that departs from Puerto Juarez to Isla Mujeres is much cheaper than going on the ferry that departs from the hotel zone to Isla Mujeres."

Coming back, it was the same set list but if you took video of the female performance, it may be a little NSFW. Hey, anything for tips, right? One word of caution, do not get a car rental from playa for Cozumel. I won't go into it but if anyone from the ticket booth wants you to rent from Iguana Tours for a car, don't do it. It was terrible. There are many car rental services in Cozumel once you get off the ferry and the prices are very reasonable. But again do not let yourself be led to a little office behind the senor frogs. Big waste of time."

We decided to leave our rental car at a lot in Playa Del Carmen and just use the people ferry over to Cozumel for our 3 night stay. Glad we did. The round trip ferry service for a family of four was $57 USD. One trip on the car ferry for a family of 4 was quoted as $80 for just one way. So, this was the way to go. Plus, cabs in Cozumel are regulated so fairs are predictable. They checked out large bags as we neared the vessel and baggage claim after the trip was easy. We sat upstairs in the open area where unbeknownst to us they have live 'entertainment'. A karaoke version of the song and the performer sings. Not bad since it's included. If this is too loud or bothers you, just head inside! Drinks were good and were affordable. All in all we will use UltraMar again when we head back to Cozumel."

It is a 20 minute (beautiful) ferry ride from Cancun to Isla Muejeres, leaving every 30 minutes at the top and bottom of the hour. The cost is around $8 round trip. I purchased tickets through their website a few days ahead, where they send an email voucher that allowed me to pick up the tickets once we are arrived at the terminal in Cancun. I am not sure how much time this saved us, but this is an option.The Ferry only holds 250 people. Get there early, say at least 15-20 minutes before to get inline (with tickets), so that if the boat fills up that you do not have to wait for the next boat.There are two levels: the top is open (outside) and the bottom is inside with air-conditioning. They ask if you have wet clothes or item to seat upstairs. If you have luggage, you will be asked to store them at the back out of the boat, so remove any valuables before getting onto the boat, since you will be separated from them during the trip.They do sell snacks and drinks on the ride."

Do not do that! Some guy in charge scolded us \"Pero porque lo ripio!!!\" and the lady that was in charge of boarding too.

My girlfriend and I were staying a week in Cozumel and decided to go to Playa Del Carmen for a day.When we got to the ferry ticket office across from the town square, there were not less than three people that spotted us as dumb tourists and ushered us to the ticket window where there was no line and several clerks. The tickets were $8 one way which is crazy cheap for a ferry boat. It was very well organized and the people were ultra nice and helpful. We went out on the open air area of the upper deck, and, to our surprise, as soon as the boat was underway, an entertainer appeared, a guy in dreadlocks but dressed very nice and he sang songs like Frank Sinatra, mostly in Spanish. He had his own amplifier set-up and apparently worked for tips.On the way back, there was a four man rock ensemble and they were great. They played a variety of rock music, mostly sang in English, and we loved it. We gave them a generous tip, and they handed me a CD.Very very fun pleasant trip. You have a choice of ferry companies, just pick the next one to leave."

I have no complaints at all about the actual ferry service which is why I'm giving it four stars. However, I purchased round-trip tickets for 8 people through my credit card using points from their reward program. We were able to board with no problem going to the island. Coming back was a different story. They kept saying they couldn't find the reservation and we actually missed one ferry while they fooled around with this. Since we were flying home and had to meet the shuttle, this didn't sit well because we were held up for 45 minutes. One of the employees even told another we were lying in Spanish but my friend knew what she said and called her out on it. They finally allowed us to get the tickets which we had already paid for. If the company is going to offer this kind of deal, they need to be prepared to honor it - we were not going to pay for tickets twice. I'm sure buying tickets there would have been no problem."

They leave on the half hour and hour so it's easy to get a ride. It is less expensive to purchase a round trip ticket. The drawback is that you do have to ride back with the same company. We chose to ride round trip on the Ultramar because it was leaving the soonest. We were going to wait (there were 5 of us)because the ticket was more expensive than the other two companies, but they gave me a discount, so even ferry tickets are negotiable.The ticket booth gave us the return ferry schedule, so it made it easy for us to find a convenient time to return.Do take caution if you are planning to return late. The last boat can fill up and then you will have to wait until morning to return. One of the hotel workers told us it had happened to her the previous week."

Though it is largely a series of cruise ship docks and anchorings it is beautiful and different in its own right. The plaza at both Playa Del Carmen and Cozumel near both docks are fun a worth a look. An easy cab ride to the terminal from locations in Playa Del Carmen. Take the UltraMar Ferry. Blue and yellow \"and\" big really easy to spot.The real story hear is the crazy fun of riding the ferry with all the locals and Mexican tourists sprinkled with a handful of international tourists.The breeze is always blowing it seems in Playa. Beautiful breeze actually. The large safe passenger ferry makes its way to Cozumel in about 45 minutes dock to dock.On this day we sat by the Port side of the ferry and we were sprayed by lovely warm seawater as we cruised through some waves. The boat gently rocked but never scary. Just perfect actually.I addition we had the fantastic entertainment. A reggae singer on the way over with people dancing including one crew and plenty of laughter and smiles.On the return cruise we had a four piece blues in Espanol band. What fun.In addition we had a Tupperware convention group on board. Probably gathered for a weekend sales and celebration event. These ladies rocked the trip. Laughter and singing is always good.Felt like we were miles away on some wonderful adventure. Certainly made our day and would not want to have missed that adventure in our three week visit to Playa Del Carmen and our lovely unique stay in the \u201csingular\u201d Petit Lafitte Boutique Hotel."

With all the research I did for my first trip to Mexico I neglected to read more detail about the part where I took the ferry from Playa Del Carmen to Cozumel. Our airport transfer driver basically brought us to the ticket booth for UltraMar - I just didn't realize there were multiple ferry companies. Don't get me wrong, I was fine with the ferry ride, just wish I knew a few things. One - it is not great to buy your return ticket ahead of time because then you are stuck with that specific ferry boat unless you want to pay for new tickets. When we returned we had just missed the 11 a.m. ferry and had to wait until 12:30 for the next boat. There were other ferries leaving at 11:30 and 12 that we could have taken if we did not already have tickets. This would have been okay if we didn't have all of our luggage with us. The boat ride was enjoyable - we sat on the top deck and enjoyed the sunshine. We were not expecting the entertainment. On our trip over it was a trio of musicians and they performed some fun songs - a few from my zumba class so that was fun, but they wanted tips at the end and I didn't like feeling like I needed to pay additional money for the entertainment that I was not expecting to have on the trip. On our return trip we were at least aware that it was going to happen so it was our choice to still sit on top even though there would be an entertainer. This time it was a solo male singer with a karaoke machine and it was just not very good. Bottom line - buy your ticket only when you are ready to go - there are multiple ferry boats at different times each day. UtraMar was a great ride, but know that there are singers on the top level. Unfortunately I don't know what the bottom part of the boat is like."

The boats feel well maintained and the staff feels more happy to be there. I took the ferry from Puerto Juarez instead of Playa Tortuga or any of the other Zona Hotelera beaches - Puerto Juarez is much cheaper comparatively for identical service. Carry pesos, the exchange rate will screw you if you let them - but that's as with anywhere else in Mexico. The one caveat - they say the lower deck is air conditioned: it is, but if you sit by the windows in the lower deck then you don't have the full effect of A/C. It may almost be worth it to trade off for an upper deck seat."

There are a couple different ferry companies, but I just liked the color of the boat, and that's how I made my decision. The ferry is located near 5th & Juarez in Playa del Carmen, and as you walk through the park/town square, there are a ton of vendors. There is also a restaurant, I think it is called Mexico Loco, but it is just past the ADO bus station and start walking toward the beach on the left. It had really good 'lemonade', in Mexico lemonade is actually limeade, but it hit the spot on a humid day. If you linger in the park area, you will get bombarded by little kids trying to sell their trinkets. It is sad to see, but once we told them, 'No thank you' (Or, \"No, Gracias\" in spanish), they walked away. As we got closer to the ferry, we had people asking if we were taking the ferry, and my mistake was that I started talking to someone before getting to the Ultramar booth. I got to the booth and purchased our tickets, I did one way because I wasn't sure what time we would head back, incase Ultramar didn't have the time we needed to leave. You don't save any money by purchasing round-trip, it is the same cost. After getting our tickets, the guy I talked to before the booth, was still standing there wanting me to 'help' me plan activities like renting a scooter while in Cozumel. Don't fall for this, there are other people on the other side that will actually have the equipment, I handed him my change in pesos and walked away so he would leave me alone.On the boat, you can sit on a bench outside or go in the inside where it is crisply air-conditioned. On the way to Cozumel we sat outside on the covered area, it was a nice ride, then we got entertained by a singer with huge speaker, looking for money. He was pretty good, but it was a little annoying that the company and employees allowed this, as some of us don't want to sit and listen to music we don't know, especially that it was blaring. My only other comment is that they have drinks and snacks on board that are pretty cheap compared to other places. I paid in pesos, which is typically cheaper than paying in US Dollars."

Places to sit indoors, in A/C, or outside on metal benches (covered on top). Snacks and drinks, including beer, available on board. We had our luggage with us and were instructed to drop it off in one area and the porters would load it onto the ferry. They give you luggage claim slips so don\u2019t lose yours. 30 min trip to Cozumel. Sit outside and scan the sea for flying fish! I really enjoyed just watching the blue colors of the ocean and feeling the warm sunny breeze on my skin \u2013 it helped put me in a relaxing mood for the start of my vacation. When we arrived at the Coz ferry dock, the porters loaded the suitcases onto a baggage cart and transported it 50 ft away onto an oval conveyor belt in a \u201csecured\u201d area. This took longer than it did to get all the people off the ferry. We pulled our bags off the conveyor belt and had our luggage slips ready to show the security personnel at the exit of the secure area. It will go faster if you have a few dollars in your hand along with your luggage slips. On the way back a few days later, we also dropped our luggage off with the porters and gave them a few $ tip, then retrieved it at PDC where they just put the bags out behind a tension barrier and you pointed to your bags (with $ in your hand) and they handed you your bags. This was faster than the conveyor belt that they used the first time. Either way, the key is to always have a few USD in your hand when you ask for something. There was a band on board in the upper deck/outside area and they played live music while we rode across to PDC. They also came around with a tip jar and were selling CD\u2019s. They were not bad at all and they sang alternating songs in Spanish and English. Again, snacks and drinks were being sold as soon as the ferry left the dock.

At the end of the day be sure to queue up early as the ferry terminal can get quite busy with everyone trying to leave the island."

The ride was very smooth. Two gentlemen walked around with papers to rent a golf cart on the island. It was only $35.00 USD for the day. You really cant beat that. The golf cart we had was pretty beat up but, for $35.00, I wasn't surprised. I will definitely be taking the ferry again when I return to Cancun."

The trip across the water was quick (20 minutes) and the waves were of no real concern until we docked at the pier in Playa del Carmen. The water was anything but calm on that side. The dock staff secured the ferry effortlessly and assisted every single person from the rocking boat. The return trip home left on time as well, but the waves were gigantic this time ! The captain maneuvered the ferry really well through the 30' swells and we docked safely back in Cozumel, although it did take about 45 minutes through those waves."

Just on the horizon off the coast of Cancun lie a unique Island where you can have a great day out, Using the ferry from alongside Riu Peninsular it only takes 25 minutes to reach the Island during which they offer to sell you tickets for golf carts on the Island which is the best way to get around. You will find that on reaching the Island there are dozens of places to hire these carts so you do not need to buy tickets on board the ferry. Once you arrive and hire a cart you set off on the circular road that circumnavigates the small Island and takes in sightseeing activities such as the turtle farm, well worth a stop, and the Punta Sur which gives fantastic views over the wild ocean and huge surfing style waves. We had great fun on the carts and they are really easy to drive if you can stop laughing long enough. There are loads of places to stop and take in the views and I definitely recommend it for anyone visiting the hotel resorts in Cancun."

The ferry experience was fine- it was a 30 minute trip and the ferry was clean and comfortable. However, I made the mistake of booking a Jeep rental through Ultramar (they will offer you car rental, scooter rental, excursions, etc. when you buy your ferry tickets). The company they use is called Rooster's and it's terrible. The Jeep we got was missing the front passenger seat belt, the radio was broken, the check engine light was on, and the lone windshield wiper was broken (which became highly problematic when we got caught on the road in a late afternoon downpour). Book the ferry, but do yourself a favor and book a rental car directly through Avis or one of the established international rental companies on Cozumel."

A storm had just moved through, there was a high wind and probably 10 ft swells. I grew up on the water and this was one of a handful of times I was afraid on the water. The crew, who speaks no English, sheparded us to the top. No choice for downstairs given. We were soaked 2 minutes into. The crew was laughing. They keep moving people from right to left- obviously not a good thing to do in high seas because you are overweighing one side of the boat.There was room for everyone downstairs and NO ONE should have been on top. People were sick everywhere. I was just afraid. This is how ferries capsize. We wound up moving to ENCLOSED downstairs 10 minutes into the hour long trip- which was WAY TOO dangerous. It is only a matter of time before this one winds up in the news. Do yourself a favor- pay a little extra money and/or go a little further and get on a bigger boat."

Wil said it's only took 15mins walking. However, it took half hour for us-first time visitor walking in the beach. We gave up and came back to reschedule for 10AM next day morning. We came to the information center again to check with the tour around 8:50am. The staff in the information booth said everything is ready for you guys, but the trip not including lunch. We were very surprised but since we paid already we still made our trip. That was not end of our surprises yet. Weather was good in Playa del Carmen but too windy in Cozumel. The ferry was really turbulent due to choppy waves and high speeds! After we landed, the snorkeling was closed in Cozumel due to windy and cold! We were very angry! We just checked before we left. The staff that told us everything was good to go in the morning apparently didn't call the tour guides at Cozumel, and did not inform us not to go because of the cancellation. We waited another 2 hrs for the return ferry since we did not plan to shop or do any other activities and we did not bring enough money and cloth....The guy Wil told us $18 only is for child, and $20 for adult...He took $2 per person into his pocket because the ferry ticket is $10 for child; $18 for adult.... And it's even worse to get refund! It took a day and half just to get refund for the snorkeling trip.... Wil and his staff were not trustworthy!! ...

If you purchase a round trip ticket you might save a couple of dollars but it will cost you in time. 3- In order to get a decent seat, go ahead and get in line on the dock.I took the UltraMar ferry on the way over to Cancun and one of the competitors on the way back. UltraMar was less expensive, a better experience with entertainment, beverage servers and more outside seating. I would recommend this service. The bright yellow and blue boats."

THey were both very relieved. In the meantime, THE FERRY HAD LEFT WITHOUT US AND WE HAD TO WAIT AN HOUR until the next ferry departed to Cozumel. But that is not the end of it. When we reached the Aqua Safari pier in Cozumel, THE SNORKEL TRIP HAD LEFT WITHOUT US, even when we were assured that \"they will be waiting for you in Cozumel\". We had to wait another TWO AND A HALF hours until the next snorkel trip departed, and as you can guess, it was probably one of the worst snorkel trips we\u00b4ve had, including crappy equipment and rude manners from the staff, who was only worried about their tips.

The first day we tried to get to Isla Mujeres, we popped out of the hotel, and in typical Mexican fashion, a concierge sort, definitely not an employee of the Riu, put us in a cab that went maybe 8 blocks for 15 bucks, I knew then that we had just been had. The terminal was like a little craft fair clip joint, and the lady in the booth, wanted 3 times the rate I had read. I seldom get miffed, but suggested, she was goosing us just a bit too much, and we walked off. The frugal wife wanted to bus it back to the Riu but a little old cabbie pulled up, and asked where we were going. I told him, I didn't find a closed automotive shop and a tire store, very interesting, so he took us back to the hotel for 10 bucks, and due to the one way set ups, had to go maybe 40 blocks. I got up the next morning, and noticed the ferry docking 200 feet down the beach. Long story short, we walked 200 feet on the sand, had a couple of beer, and went to Isla Mujeres. I would compare riding around the Isla comparable to the Road to Hana, on Maui. I wouldn't call it a waste of time, but it used the better part of one day, out of our 7. The departure time on our return didn't suit us, so we took the first boat, to the downtown terminal, which is a good place to depart, other than our original departure dock, earlier that day, next to the hotel. I still wonder why the guy outside the hotel sent us on a bum steer the first day, other than the cab driver pieces off concierge guy, and the lady in the booth is in cahoots with the cab driver. Welcome to Mexico. If you feel you are being had, just don't do it. We had an inexpensive lesson. This post is under the ferry, not so much the Isla. To be clear, the ferry was very professional, it was just the rest of the day, was not so hot"

Currently the charge 163 pesos... (about $10 US). The two others, Caribe and Mexico III charge 138 or so pesos. Ultramar seems to be the fastest... by a few minutes. The boat is modern, clean and as nice as any ferry I've been on (and I've ridden on ferries in Vancouver, Seattle, L.A. and Key West). The typical person will walk up to the three counters and look at the posted times for when the next ferry leaves... and pick the earliest one. Usually you only need to buy one way and then buy your return ticket when you are coming back... again usually from the one leaving the soonest."

You can get the ferry from the Hotel Zone for $19, but they also operate out of Puerto Juarez for 164 Pesos (about $10) and you can reach that on the R1 bus. You may have to wait a little longer for the bus back to the Hotel Zone from Puerto Juarez but I'm a sucker for paying local prices. Simple but nice ferry service that will get you to Isla Mujeres every half hour."

We arrived to book our ferry tickets fro transport from Cancun to Isla Mujeres after checking with the concierge in the hotel to make sure the ferry was running. After we arrrived, they told us that the ferry was not running from that location but they would bus us to another location in which the ferry was running. We were planning on renting a golf cart on the island for the whole day. The guy who sold us our tickets told us that if we did not book it thought him, we would not be ableto get one. So, like the suckers we ended up bing, we did it. Do NOT do this. There are many available rides right across the street from the port and were less than the cost to rent from the ferry operator. Plus, we ended up having to walk several blocks to try and locate the building that we could get our golf cart from. When we got there, we found out that we only had until 5 PM with the golf cart. This was a problem since we were delayed several times through no fault of our own. Plus, the guy running the counter was rude and \"could not understand english well.\"The bus that they arranged to transport us pulled up on the side of the road and told us to get out for the ferry. This was after we were delayed once more by the bus driver running a red ligth and getting pulled over. We had no idea where we were going and there was no one from the ferry service to help us. A nice gentleman on the sidewalk helped us. We ended up having to walk a couple of blocks and wait another 45 minutes for the next ferry.... all the more taking time away from our day there and the golf cart rental. The ferry was nice and well taken care of. The service was absolutely horrendeous!"

We planned to go to Playa (from Cozumel) on Sunday of our trip and pretty early in the morning. We got there around 8:15 and the next ferry was at 8:30 but with Mexico WaterJets company. We bought a round trip and went about our way. This was the first time we've taken this company but we did because it was the next trip out. The mistake here was that when we were ready to leave Playa we had just missed the ferry and the next one wasn't for another hour and a half. Therefor, we bought a one way with UltraMar so we could get back to Cozumel. I would always recommend getting one way tickets, no matter which ferry line for this. Anyways, UltraMar is always my favorite for multiple reasons but to name a few, they always have crew members walking around making sure everyone is okay and that everyone has a safe trip and they always leave on time. With the exception of one time, we've had entertainment on the boat which I love. It really gets people in the mood to have a good time. I know some people can get sea sick and many have complained about that on the reviews. I've been a handful of times and I've never felt sick even with high waves. I wouldn't criticize the ferry line for that as its a more as a individual thing. I think they are very safe and look out for all passengers. UltraMar would be by first choice when traveling by sea whether its to Playa, Cozumel, Cancun or Isla Murjeres. I've been to all and all sizes of boats."

I did not think much about the conversion until I after I boarded that she have overcharged me about $8. Coming back I used a credit card, go figure, and it was the same cost but when I received my Capital One alert it was $36 USD. The lady basically pocketed $8."

I went over and got 2 one-way tickets to Cozumel for $163 MXN each. We used UltraMar because it was the ferry line running the soonest from Playa del Carmen to Cozumel and was the last one we could be on to meet the 16:00 deadline.UltraMar is the yellow and blue line. Their ferries have an open air deck, it was open when we went this trip, on Saturday afternoon November 1st so we sat on top with the blinds open, it was refreshing. There was live music and people selling snacks and drinks, including National beers.All together the ferry takes an hour; this includes loading, travel and unloading. They now tag your luggage when you check it in, giving you half the tag to claim it at the other side. You give them the tag, point out your bag, they verify the tag matches and give it to you. Do not lose the tags; it will cause a considerable hassle for you, especially if you do not speak Spanish. They have never told me there was a limit to the amount of luggage you can bring, we have hauled tons of luggage and groceries but that does not mean that there is not a limit that they enforce at high capacities.The ferry ride can be rough and often times it is. I have only had one smooth trip. If you tend to get car, motion or boat sickness you will want to take medication for it before crossing. I grew up on boats and never had a problem but there have been several times that the sea has gotten the ferry\u2019s bow a rolling, especially in the lower deck, where it can sway and roll back and forth as you bump and ram wave after wave, and I myself could not wait to get onto steady land.

The confusion is there are price charts at hotels, at the warf etc... None of them give the same price. We were later told 30.00 US each return was a really good deal.I guess the only advice is don't be suprised that no one seems to know how muchit costs!!! Also if you want to sit up top for the view you will have to be ther early and wait in line. Also use the bathroom before you get on, one of the ladies in our group used the facilites and there was an inch of waste on the floor. she was told it was from the waves rocking the boat around.

I explained that the agent at Playa had taken the ticket stubs, and this wasn't my fault. I was told tough and I had to buy another ticket. I refused to buy another ticket as I had already paid for a return ticket. The guy radioed his supervisor and he came back telling me I needed to buy another ticket. Being polite didn't work. The only thing that did work was going absolutely mental and keeping at it until they let me board.Total rip off merchants - they need to train their staff properly (unless it's a scam), it's not exactly rocket science to tear and retain the correct part of a ticket!!!! Whilst I was having my strop, an American couple told me they had done exactly the same to them. I'm assuming since they were boarding with a ticket and not going crazy, that they gave in and bought a new ticket. Nice money making scam. I loved the diving on Cozumel - saw turtles and dolphins.

There are lots of scooters and motorbikes in town which can make it tricky but the open road makes it enjoyable and the coast on the far side is lovely . There is some good snorkelling and then the coast opens out to wild, windy rocky beaches and azure seas. You can continue on foot if you like walking.

There was live entrainment on two of the trips and they were a fantastic distraction from the queasiness. Note that they do not always except credit cards. If there's a long line to get tickets prior to the departure time\u2026you're out of luck. Have cash available (the nearby ATM were not working) Friendly staff, clean seats and did I mention the band!"

The ferry leaves from Playa del Carmen every 2-3 hours until 10pm. You will arrive within 30-40 minutes depending on the conditions of the seas. I found this mode of transportation very economical during my Riviera Maya tour costing 163 pesos one way. I stayed in Cozumel a week and returned via ferry back to Playa del Carmen to catch a bus from ADO terminal for the airport. Everything is very close together. On the other side if you decide to land in Cozumel by plane and want to visit Playa del Carmen for the day you can do so taking the ferry up until 9pm. Take advantage of the UltraMar convenient transportation the next time you visit the Riviera Maya. Happy Travels!!!!"

I have to say our experience on UltraMar was much better than Mexico Waterjets which is the one that runs the opposite hours. The boat we got with Mexico Waterjets (the noon one that leaves Cozumel to go to Playa) was awful. The top \"outdoor\" section is only open on the back so it's pretty enclosed and spells like fuel fumes. The lower enclosed air condition has windows which at first I thought were frosted but I think it might be layers of dried salt so you can't see out. The two times we've been on Ultra Mar they have a nice open section on top so you can see where you're going and catch the fresh air.We will make sure we plan our departure next time to get UltraMar for a better (less nauseous) experience."

This ferry crew are AMAZING!! From the moment, we stepped on the ferry, they greeted us, offered us drinks and I spoke to them in Spanish (I have been learning Spanish for six years and am trying to become fluent in the language!). We didn't really know where to sit so we sat on the lower deck, closest to the water. The water can get quite a bit bumpy and they give everyone barf bags just in case! The people we sat behind got seasick and I am very surprised that we didn't follow suit. The ferry crew were amazing at coming around and helping the people that were sick and making sure those who weren't were feeling okay! Since, we had to go on the ferry twice, we talked to many travelers who suggested to sit on the top deck of the ferry (the sea air helped make you feel less sick!). We tried that and it really worked! It was nighttime when we came back and a completely dark ride through the open waters but, my mom and I felt so much better sitting on the top deck then, the other deck that we rode on. The ferry crew was the same as we had seen much earlier in the day and they remembered us and talked to us for a while! SUCH a friendly crew aboard this ferry definitely sit on the top deck though if you are nervous about the ride!"

We took three trips to the mainland while in Cozumel and between Ultramar and Mexican WaterJets we much preferred the Ultramar ferry's, as their boats were better and cleaner. Just know that sometimes they have issues that cause the schedule to unexpectedly change (happened to us). So, make sure to plan on catching an earlier ferry back, so you have a back up in the case of that change. Also, if you transport your dive gear with you back/forth, watch it from the moment it is being offloaded and you will be able to pick it up right off the deck after the other luggage is removed or directly from the baggage supervisor without having to worry about it (a couple dollars goes a long way in making this a faster smoother baggage pick up)."

Only purchase a one way ticket (no discount for round-trip), then you can take whatever ferry is sitting at the dock when you want to leave.

There is a small bar on the lower deck that serves snacks and drinks.For a family of 4 (3 adults, 1 child) we we able to pay using a Visa credit card 3 separate times (about 600 pesos). However one time on a trip from Playa Del Carmen to Cozumel, they told us cash only. Not sure why. Also they severely questioned the age of my daughter. She is 11 but 5'4\" tall and they gave me some grief when I presented a child's ticket for her.Other than that tough, the ferry is a quick (45 minutes), easy ride between San Miguel and Playa Del Carmen. The ferry was always on time and the ride was always comfortable.One thing to keep in mind is that sometimes there is no 9:00pm ferry. Not sure why that is, but we got caught by that once and had to stick around Playa Del Carmen for the 10:00pm ferry instead. Also the two ferry companies share hours, so it is probably not a good decision to ever buy a round trip ticket."

This was great because if you buy round-trip, you only have certain times to come back, w/the one-way you have more flexibility. It was a last minute decision for us, but we still got on - it was packed - holds about 450+ people. Because we were all but last, we ended up on top in the sun. It was nice - but bring a hat, just in case - it's toasty w/o shade! I get sea sick VERY easy, so I was pretty concerned, and was frankly glad to be outside. No sea sick at all, pretty smooth ride and only took about 30 mins.On the way back, we got in line earlier and were seated on the inside - it was quite plush, very air conditioned and extremely comfortable-yes, you're packed in there, but the seats are very roomy, so you don't feel squished. Again, very concerned about sea sickness, but I did fine, no problems at all, even though we sat on a side, rather than in the middle.

So don't worry if you think you won't fit on the ferry! There was space for everyone inside. The ferry is clean, but the bathrooms are not great. So wait until you get to the dock and use those if you need."

It cost the same buying 2 single tickets than a return one so although is a pain to the queue twice, you might want to see which company is leaving first at the time of your return and buy your ticket then.You can purchase drinks on board. Trip is around 50 min. Pretty easy. The only bad thing are ones cutting lines, pushing, etc. Shameful to say that this behaviour was displayed by the visitors and the locals. I am wondering what these people would say if we saw the same behaviour carried on by visitors at home. Ferry had plenty of seats. If you tend to be cold, be aware that there is a strong air con inside so head upstairs for outdoor seating or bring something to cover up. Enjoy Cozumel and its beautiful waters."

The staff take your bags upon boarding, there are comfy seats inside to sit on or you can take in the fresh air and sit outside. The line for the ferry to Cozumel was huge as it was peak season, but on the way back it was quicker and quieter. The ride itself was pleasant. There were a few bumps but overall very enjoyable. There are two services available, however due to our departure and arrival times, the UltraMar was the one going when we wanted to leave."

People going to work, back packers and tourists - all together bouncing about on the beautiful carribean sea. The hire cars are a sight to see - we hired what we thought was to be a volkswagon \"herbie\" convertible - metallic green and held together with ties - even mod con air conditioning via the hole in the floor!! Still, we certainly attracted a lot of interest and still grin about our adventure some 5/6 months on.Travelling around Cozumel is easy enough and the beautiful coast line will take your breath away, white horses all the way. Don't bother paying for costly trips - even if you could find one. The booking office for the ferry is easy to find and not over crowded nor expensive. The shops in Cozumel,'s main street cater for the \"rich cruise shippers\" and have security on the doors - ready to protect all of the precious jewels and metals - what a dazzling site. Venture further in and you will find all of the usual bars/cafes and market stalls - all willing to haggle - and make sure you do. All in all, a great day and still giggling about our day in \"herbie\"!"

A suggestion we took was only purchase a one way ticket. That way, you can leave on the ferry leaving right away and on the way back, go to the ferry line which has the next ferry to depart. The price of 2 one way tickets is the SAME as a round trip ticket. They will try to sell you a round trip ticket but we are so glad we didn't. On the way back, the ferry leaving when we were ready to go was actually the other company. Otherwise, with a round trip ticket, we would have ended up waiting another hour...The ferries are wonderful and clean. No worries there!"

While we were staying in Cancun we decided to go visit Isla Mujeres using the Ultramar ferry.I wanted to take it from Puerto Juarez since it is a lot cheaper, but getting the right information on how to get there from the hotel zone was a little hard to obtain. I got a lot of conflicting information from the front-desk, concierge, travel agency, etc...Some said that the ferry was the same price from Playa Tortuga, other told me that the only way to get to Puerto Juarez was to use a taxi, etc... So here is the real information, as of today at least. The round-trip ferry ride cost you 17.00$US from Playa Tortuga and about 10.75$US (140 Pesos) from Puerto Juarez so it is cheaper (about 6.25$US per person) from Puerto Juarez.There is a bus that goes from the hotel zone to Puerto Juarez, it is the R-1 Bus with \"Puerto Juarez\" written in the front window. Not all \"R-1\" buses go to Puerto Juarez, but from what we saw the \"R-1 Puerto Juarez\" bus runs about every 20 minutes. The bus ride from Park Royal hotel (middle of hotel zone) to Puerto Juarez took us 21 minutes.This bus let you out right in front of the Puerto Juarez Ultramar Ferry, and picks you up at the same place at the end of the day. No trouble at all !About the ferry ride, it is very frequent so you won't have to wait to long to catch one, and it is quite fast, about 15 minutes.This is a great way to get to Isla Mujeres and it is cheap so we enjoyed it and would recommend it."

The ferry runs all day once an hour and costs about $12 one way. There are two ferry companies that provide service. Mexi-jet and Ultramar.

The ride was extremely rough and people were throwing up everywhere, faster than the staff could hand out the little blue barf bags. We saw a much larger UltraMar ferry sitting in the dock; I don't know why they were using the little ferry, but it was a very rough passage. The sea didn't seem to be overly rough. At the end, they pulled out a big hose to wash all the vomit off the deck, so I guess this is something they are used to.We spent all day in Cozumel being worried about the return trip and another forty-five minutes of people throwing up everywhere.. the sea seemed to look much wavier and rougher later in the day, so we took a chance and booked the return ticket with another company called Mexico Waterjets. It was a world of difference. The ride was so calm in comparison, even though we could SEE huge waves, we did not feel them on the much bigger boat, and it was only thirty minutes rather than forty-five. I would absolutely not recommend travelling with UltraMar unless they are using the bigger of their ferries-- our ride on the smaller one was simply awful."

There are 2 different ferry companies leaving at different times. So if you don't want to be stuck wating to come back, don't buy round trip tickets. On our last ferry to cozumel we missed the ultra mar, but were able to buy tickets with the other company which were the same price, we were glad we didn't buy the roundtrip or we would have had to wait another hour for the ultra mar and we ready to get back to our hotel.P.S. If you have any mexican coins you want to get rid of take them to tip the band, they make their money off tips only."

We sat inside on the way there and I thought I was going to sweat to death, but on the way back we sat on the top part and there was a nice breeze and you got to see more. Also whichever port you start from, just buy a one way ticket instead of roundtrip because there are two different companies at the port and when you are ready to come back you can see which one is leaving next. That way you don't have to wait an hour if you just missed the ferry from your roundtrip ticket."

For the month of August the schedule went like this: odd days (1,3,5,7, etc.) had even times, such as 8am, 10am, noon, 2 pm departures. And the opposite for even days...they had odd times such as 7am, 9am, 11am, etc. Just check their website, they even have a twitter account. Anyways, getting back to the story....got there at 7am and asked if we could board. They responded tickets are around the corner. So we went there and were told it was 156 pesos or something like that for one way. It ended up being $25 roundrip. There were no peddlers, hustlers, or anything of that sort. We just saw a ticketbooth that read \"Ultramar\" and the yellow and blue, which are their colors. We boarded and left around 7:10 or 7:15. They are pretty punctual. No musician playing, no music period. No wallets stolen, no theft. None of what I read about terrible experiences. My wife said the morning ride was \"peaceful, relaxing.\" Her and I get a bit seasick. Yes, it's true, you do get wet if you don't sit in the middle or are just on the wrong side. We got wet and moved to the middle just everyone else moved. No biggie. Got there in a half hour and same on the way back.We took the last boat at 8pm on that day. It was packed, but we arrived 30 minutes earlier. They had 3 boats lined up to take people back to Cancun. This time it was a bit late, not quite as punctual. Plus, there was a van that said \"Funeral\" on it near the dock, so we assumed some dead guy was getting transported by boat back to Cancun. It took awhile. Some people cut in line and hear whistles and some yelling at them. My wife and I sat inside in the AC this time. However, the waters are rougher during the night and she said she felt dizzy, disoriented, but not seasick. We had no problem with buying roundtrip tickets from this company.They have bathrooms, snacks for purchase, and wi-fi. They seemed pretty punctual for the most part and were courteous. You pick up the ferry at Playa Del Carmen. Just go to the dock and around that area you'll see the ticket booth. When you arrive at Cozumel, there is only one main dock there, so just tell the cab driver and you'll pick up the ferry exactly where you got dropped off. There was no confusion at all for us. I'd recommend taking this ferry to anyone."

The main thing I do not like about the ferry is the process to purchase tickets and boarding/unboarding the boat. First tickets - you really need to watch the people selling tickets - I have had them try not to give me my change twice! So be on your watch here. I suggest always buying one way tickets because there are 2 ferry companies that leave at different times and the tickets are not transferrable. So I have purchased a round trip ticket once and had to wait > 2 hours to return due to the hours of operation of the company I purchased it from. And you do not save any money buying a round trip ticket. But the sellers do not tell you that - they always assume you want a round trip ticket - so you have to say one way. Also, I find the tickets expensive - $156 pesos each way. The boarding/unboarding process is very unorganized and be prepared to find yourself having to push your way to get off.Oh and sometimes they have live music, which is nice, but be prepared to be hit up for tips at the end."

There are attendants who moniter passengers for green-ness and will whip out plastic baggies for them.

But what you gonna do, u have to pay to get there, or go to cozumel. It's a great ride but the should be kinder to the picket books of the tourist, that want to see there country.

We noticed a woman next to us who had a different color ticket with a different price on it, so I dont know if we got screwed or not, but for the price it sure feels like it.

Watching the cruise ships coming in to Cozumel was something new to us as we do not visit the populated destinations as a rule.One thing, there are some very rude tourists who feel they own an entire row of seating.Upon our arrival at Playa, I did hear of some wallets and purses had gone missing. Not sure why they are not keeping an eye on their belongings.The times fluctuate every day. The ferry that left at 7 one morning will leave at 8 the next day. This is simply my recommendation to be weary when using this transportation. It is reliable and safe, just not consistent as a public transportation user from the US.Again, nice ride.

My BIGGEST complaint is the ticket counter. Two out of the three times I purchased tickets the cashier tried to rip me off, either by overcharging when the fee was clearly printed on the board behind her head, or by short changing. On one of the trips they sold more tickets than there were seats forcing people to sit on the floor of the outer upper deck. The good points...Free wifi. Someone is always around the ticket counter with a brochure to show you your ferry schedule so you are aware of the return times. If you can get a seat there's nice comfortable seats inside with a/c, t.v's, and sometimes entertainment. They have someone come around to sell drinks. Bench seats located outside. Didn't use the washrooms."

The sales people at the booth will charge $3 more per person and seat you in a \"waiting area\". Then they will tell you that the tide is too low to land the ferry there. They will then put you on the bus again and take you to the \"real\" ferry location where you could have bought your tickets cheaper and not gone through this scam and wasted about 45 minutes of your time. This has to be garnering thousands of extra dollars for UltraMar each year. They should be ashamed and this should be stopped immediately by the tourist authorities. The bus drivers have to be in on this too. Beware!"

I was expecting rickety old boats and to be horribly ill by the time we reached Cozumel from Playa del Carmen from all the reviews I read and stories I heard. I must say I almost think they truly did not ride the ferry. We rode the blue and yellow boats which appeared to be in VERY good condition and though not new, close to it. They were clean and well maintained with three levels. The lower level was enclosed, the middle had half walls with rails across the top and open air and then the very top was very open and windy. Per recommendation, we arrived about a half hour early which gave us our choice of seating. Being late, did not leave you with many options and the top was the last to fill but this is where many of the late comers had to go while other couples and families had to split up and sit separately in seats not filled. We had roundtrip tickets but there is no savings no matter which way you do it. In each direction, we had a great band which I believe was called Laquina, who played the entire trip for us while ushers walked around offering beverages for purchase. The trip to Cozumel took 5 songs or about a half hour while the return trip only took 4 songs and seemed a lot shorter but I am sure it was not. I would have loved to ride the ferry just to hear the band continue to play and they sold CD\u2019s which we now wish we would have purchased. The water was a bit rough this day so on the trip to Cozumel, we had taken Dramamine though we were not known to get sick. The ferry was big enough to where the motion was not overly noticeable to me \u2013 there was a band standing up playing with no problems. On the way back, I did not take Dramamine and had no problems at all. The band plays on the middle level of the boat and kept us very entertained which may have helped though too. No complaints at all about the ferry ride from us."

Almost every other passenger was sick, and the ferry staff had a heck of time handing out barf bags in sufficient quantities. What a job! Having said that, they were very accomodating. They made the rounds constantly during the 30 minute trip, even fanning and rubbing the backs of the poor souls who continued to feel ill for the whole trip. For about $15 CDN, you get a live band and can purchase cold drinks and snacks if you can keep them down!"

In fact I'm 50 years of age & have only ever thrown up half a dozen times in my entire life. God this was so rough! I'm not sure if it was the time of year or what. Maybe it's calmer in the summer? The girls were great as they rushed up & down with sick bags & tissue, & stuff to sniff, although I almost popped it in my mouth as my husband said it was a mint! Well done girls you do a fantastic job! I sat at the front bottom deck going & the waves were thrashing hight above my window. On the return journey I sat in the middle (inside) at the top & was almost sick but took deep breaths & managed not to be. It's such a shame as I love a ferry trip. The music that was outside was good but ever so loud."

For those of you who have a weak stomach, you have been forewarned...you will likely get sick on the Ferry. If I was aware of this, I would have thought twice before going but honestly did not anticipate the amount of rocking of the Ferry due to the high waves (yes, it was like any other regular day here in Playa Del Carmen).It is about a 45 minute ride each way and while it can be a pleasant experience, I do not recommend it for those who can get sea sick quickly. As you enter, they will hand out plastic throw up bags to everyone and on our trip there and return many did throw up except the locals who are likely used to it.Tip: Would not recommend on travelling on Sunday as many places are closed in Cozumel and if you decide to go, sit on the lower level as it tends to rock less than the upper level."

They decided to buy round trip tickets and had the most awful experience with Ultramar. They saw the schedule online the night before however it was totally different from what they offer at the box offer at the time they came back from Cozumel. They had to come back with another company TO AVOID TO WAIT 2-3 HOURS and had to pay another ticket. We spoke with Miguel (Manager in Playa) who has no customer skills and did not care what happended to us. He has poor skills when dealing with this situations. I guess the moral of the story is Do not buy a round trip tickets because you will be surprise when coming back."

While you will be approached by everyone to buy tickets from them, you should really buy at the ferry, since there are two companies and they come and go at different times. I'd also just buy one way so you're not locked into a return company. That paid off for me b/c I got sick during the day and we were forced to return earlier than we had initially planned.Loading and unloading was fine, but a little slow as there were only two exits doors. You're \"forced\" to watch advertisements on video the entire way, but you can tune them out. There is food and drink on board."

One woman next to me was turning greener than the color of her dress and could not get off the boat fast enough.We enjoyed the ride and would utilize this company the next time we are in either PDC or Cozumel. Just avoid all the people on the piers on both sides trying to persuade you to go to their restaurant, car rental agency, etc."

They also sell snacks and drinks including beers and margaritas. There is a clean bathroom on board. The ride was approx 30 minutes. We were dropped off near the shopping area in Cozumel so that was convenient.On our way back, the ride was super rocky. The ferry was swaying side to side almost the whole time. I'm not normally prone to motion sickness, but this was the worst ride of my life. Just two days prior, we took a fishing boat from Cancun to Isla Mujeres that was a smoother ride than this. Anyway, I held on, but my friend got sick.. Luckily, she was near a waste basket. Since the ride made us sick, we were unable to go out in Playa del Carmen. That was too bad because it dropped us off right in front of Senor Frogs and I really wanted to go there."

I left my luggage to the Ultramar employees in charged of putting my luggage onboard, they put a band with an identification number and they handed me the ticket with the same number to claim the luggage on the other side. Once in Cozumel, these employees put the luggage on a trolley while passengers were disembarking the boat. I was checking every single luggage put on the moving band from the trolley, anxious to get to my hotel and relax. I noticed there was an employee at the exit of the luggage claim area checking everybody\u2019s claim ticket to make sure no one leaves with a luggage that does not belong to them. My luggage did not appear even after the trolley was emptied. I quickly notified the responsible from Ultramar on site. He communicated with the quay in Playa del Carmen, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I gave them the cell phone number where they could reach me in case they find it.I had to go to the hotel without a thing. I never received a call from them. Two days after, when I could finally get in touch with a higher responsible from Ultramar, I was accused to have orchestrated everything to have my luggage stolen and then claim it! I still have the claiming ticket in y possession but no luggage and still no compensation from Ultramar.I had to go to have a police report because my passport was inside my luggage. There they explained me that often the company\u2019s own employees steal and unfortunately there is no way to prove it. Do not take Ultramar. They fool tourists."
