I must say, that visit was really interesting and there was much to see also for teens (and adults).. Warmly recommend! Also the film in the kino room was interesting, with subtitles in English it would have been even better. What I especially appreciate was the humour and small statements written in scenery info plates. LOL a man with saw..In general I highly respect the professional craftsmen, who offer these realistic sceneries to public! And variety of genious little details!"

As for downside its located far from center of the city, and its pretty much impossible to get out if here when it rains: all cabs are taken and closest public transportation towards the city center is solid 20 minutes walk, and then it took another 45 to get the correct bus/trolley.Do not go here during a rainy day unless you have own car or hotel is within walking distance Trip back ruined this visit."

Absolutely breathtaking model of Russia complete with moving trains and other vehicles. Buttons to press to activate scenes. My 2 year old loved the fire engine scene. You can see trains underground and above ground. My 4 year old was amazed by the setup for linking east and west Russia trains in the model (they go up a spiral coil slope and through a glass tunnel above your head then down another spiral oil). Around model is a step so toddlers 3+ can easily see. You may have to lift 2 year olds in parts to give them best view.Toilets the cleanest I have ever been in! Toilet seats for toddlers, antiseptic for seats, low sinks for toddlers.Self service ikea style restaurant good value and tasty. Food Russian. options of plain pasta or rice if your toddler is particular.Recommend get there early as got a bit too busy to see with toddlers from 1pm. We got there 11 and it was pretty empty till 11:30. Need to leave prams outside and leave rucksacks in cloakroom. Can't recommend highly enough."

The layout itself is nothing short of absolutely amazing, and even then the staff continue to enhance and develop it, which you are able to observe through the windows of their workshop. Currently it's the second largest globally at 800 sqm. My daughter is 6 and really loved the interactive buttons to set various localised scenes in motion, a great touch. As a Marklin model railway collector myself, I was astounded. Even my initially doubtful Wife was highly impressed. My only regret is that I didn't know about it 2 years ago when I first visited St Petersburg! Recommend spending several hours here, and the bright, airy restaurant serves good, reasonably priced food. Improvements? It's easy to find with Google maps, but for those without mobile phone roaming, a simple map from Moskovskiye Vorata Metro station would be helpful on the website. Also I would suspect if the shop had a wider range of souvenirs and model railway related gifts, then it would prove very successful. Summing up however, I have Nothing but Immense Admiration for this Museum, and there is clearly a reason for its popularity amongst people of all ages. Grand Maket will definitely prove as memorable as the Marinsky and the Hermitage in St Petersburg. Fantastic."

You can see all Russia less then in 1 hour and got so many new information that you won't find anywhere else.It's really nice place to visit for any age people.There is number of interactive situations: you can start a work at factory by yourself or make bikers to sing at rock-festival. You can fing different geografic zones, it's landscape, animal world and everyday normal human life in very funny, smart ot even touching details) I strongly recommend to visit this place! For getting overall view - just to spend 1 hour but it's really better to keep approx 3 hour for it -for getting all advantages of Grand Maket. You can have a rest in wonderful cafe in the midle of your trip and then continue)"

This place was awesome.You can reach it by Metro - get off at the Moskovskie Vorota Metro and follow the directions on the map I have included in my photos.It is an 800 m\u00b2 model village / train / everything else layout depicting scenes from across Russia. They even have ceiling lights that roll across the length of the display simulating sunrise, day, sunset, and night. So much detail you couldn\u2019t hope to see everything.Every few feet there is another button you can press to animate a section of it, like dancers, a concert, a cow getting milked, cranes operating, etc. Two sections have timed fire displays \u2013 one grass and another buildings \u2013 where the \u201cfire\u201d starts out small and then spreads with fire appliances coming in, lights flashing, from near and far to help douse the flames. Just brilliant. Also look underneath the surface for things like the prisoners digging an escape tunnel.If you have children, bring them here and I guarantee that no matter how much time you've spent in St Petersburg, or what you've seen THIS will be what they remember.It's all controlled by staff in a control centre that some television stations would envy.English guides are available, as are binoculars. Let that fact sink in. This is how incredibly detailed this tableau is. Look for many hidden things like some farm pigs getting intimate. My favourite was a guy in a tree sawing off the limb he is sitting on with a label that reads simply: \"Idiot.\"We had morning tea in the caf\u00e9 which was reasonably priced and very nice.Our hotel (The Anturage) had 10% discount vouchers to Grand Maket Rossiya, so I would recommend staying there - or at least ask your hotel if they have the vouchers.There is a gift shop that sells all sorts of wonderful souvenirs. I got a set of books on St Petersburg sights that are fully legible actual books, with dust jackets, that are only 1cm tall.Just love this place - you could easily spend an entire day here."

It was great to talk about some of the different regions in Russia with my son (including Kaliningrad and polar station). It was heaving with staff, including an impressive command centre with a wall of screens for what must be one of the most sophisticated model railroads in the world.

So much thought has been put into the design of this model, and so much care into it's construction and so much love into its maintenance. To allow people to get so close is generous, I can't imagine how many accidents must occur which they quickly fix.It doesn't feature all the famous monuments, but maybe that would be a waste of space; there's instead room for exciting train journeys and glimpses into everyday experiences that bring it to life. Thousands of miniatures, thousands of little moments which most people won't even notice. This place is worth spending hours at. And for everyone complaining about the children, put yourself in their shoes: imagine the wonder you had at models as a child in your home, then multiply that by a thousand.One of my favourite features is the simulation of night-time. The room gets gradually darker from East to West as the lights of buildings and vehicles illuminate, and the room hushes as storms break in the clouds. It's captivating.By no means should this be a replacement for exploring Russia in person. In fact, it should be an inspiration for exploring Russia in person. Well done, Maket team."

This is sold as Russia in Miniature, which is true, but coming from a place where lots of people love model trains, I'd say it's a model train exhibit. It does show all of Russia, though I doubt it's really to scale. Certain areas certainly seem to get more \"landmass\" than they really hold. The best part is noticing little scenes, like a boat being robbed or the devil in the cemetery. Really though, either bring binoculars or rent some there, because otherwise you will miss a lot. I purposefully did not rent any so that I would have something more to see when I visit again!"

You can see all aspects of Russian life there: small countryside and big city life, a lot of moving parts like busses, cars, trains, cranes, etc. Military and productions sites, winter and summer, day and night... believe me, it's worth a trip.Practical advise: if you go by subway, turn right as soon as you are outside and then cross the street at second traffic lights and continue along the smaller adjoining street. If you are driving, there's a separate parking lot, so you won't have any headaches parking. Inside you get a cafe and wardrobe to leave your outside wear."

I came with my kids (2 and 4 years old) and I thought we would not spend too much time there. We stayed 2 hours! My eldest son pressed all buttons, asked millions of questions and was hyper excited! 2 year old daugter was impressen by moving trains! The only problem - the maquette is quite high - so I had to lift them up in turns each 2 meters :) So if you are going with small kids - there should be one pair of hands for one kid.We visited this attraction on Tuesday evening (at 7 pm) and there were 6 more visitors, so it was no queues to the \"magic\" buttons and we were examining each object without crowding."

From the metro, it's a ten minutes walk. But this is worth it - less crowded and almost the same architecture as in the city centre but without the fuss.Once you reach the museum, be ready to spend at least 2 hours. The craftsmanship is breathtaking and you may spend several minutes before an exhibit trying to take everything in. As mentioned in earlier descriptions, Spb and other Russian cities are depicted in minature form.The tickets are priced slightly higher than other museums but not too steep. Enjoy"

Most of the visitors on our early Monday morning visit were teenagers or older, but there's something magical about this attraction that makes it work no matter how old you are. The intricacy and detail is insane, from a field of 40,000 sunflowers, each no larger than your pinky nail, to little tableau of crowds and vehicles. The magic of pushing buttons and seeing these little scenes come to life is always fun, and when the room darkens and a storm strikes, you can't help but wonder at all the love that's been put into this massive, massive scene. You could easily spend an hour or two here, and on your second circuit you'll spot a bunch of details that you missed the first time around. A must-see in St. Petersburg in my opinion."

This maquet of the whole Russia is really quality made with all small details, trains, cars, buildings, trees and etc. so you could have just a small impression of how enormously huge and different Russia is. You are allowed to make photos but be careful - do not come too close because otherwise alarm system will work, the whole object is controlled with cameras and alarms system sensors. Location is not too central but it is close to \"Moskovskie vorota\" tube station. So, if it is a rainy day in St-Petersburg during your trip and it is impossible to walk around (which I always prefer to any museums even if very good museums) take your time to visit this attraction."

Plus, everything is very elaborate, is I'm not mistaken, the model took 8 years to make. BEST TIME TO COME: I think the best time to go there is in the morning, so start your day of sightseeing with that. Later in the day in gets more crowded, and there is not very much free space in there in general. People crowd around the model, so you might not be able to see some parts at all. Also, of course, same as all the other things to do in St Pete, this one is way less crowded from October to April.HOW TO GET THERE: this is the hardest part of the whole review, because even I can't explain in writing how you can get there. My advice is check the map before you go and plan your route beforehand. The place in about 10-15 minutes walking from the metro station \"Moskovskie vorota\"NOT TO MISS: 1) when you enter the territory of the model, you will see people sitting behind the glass wall. They are making models and you're welcome to look at them. it's pretty cool!2) the model has all sorts of buttons. Feel free to press them (when they turn green) and some of the things will move.3) Don't miss the \"fire\" in the Northwestern part.PLEASE NOTE: I would not recommend eating in their cafe. The food is not very good quality."

It's basically a massive set of model-train tracks on 800 square metres. The whole maket represents different regions of Russia.The detail and thought put into making it is simply amazing, you'll be stunned by how meticulously each small person or prop is. Many parts are interactive, you push the button and something happens. Fires are happening on the maket regularly, there's smoke and water from the firebrigade's pipes. Trains are running through the set, along with cars, the light is changing so you can see the whole maket in an emulated night.Unbelievable amount of work must have been put into it, so I understand there are some basic rules to make sure it won't be destroyed, i.e. taking pictures only from behind the borders of the maket and not touching anything.

There are churches and forest fires, archeological digs and military encampments, miniature chickens eating while equally tiny people harvest crops. It is a child's delight. Several school groups came through and one of the joys was watching the children react to a world in miniature. However, it is not just a place for kids. As an adult I was fascinated with the intricate detail and amazed as I saw models of buildings I recognized from my visits to Russia. It is indeed interactive with opportunities to press buttons which activate various actions. I was particularly taken with the tiny forest fire, complete with smoke and fire engines pumping simulated water on the flames. It is worth the visit."

After spending 4 enjoyable, but highly cultural hours in the Hermitage Museum we had scheduled an afternoon at Grand Maket. My wife was sceptical, but prepared to amuse my boyhood fascination with model trains. She became even less enthusiastic as we made the 10 minute walk from the metro station, though not the prettiest part of St.Petersburg. However, once we entered the building she was blown away, & couldn't stop taking photos. This is basically the best model railway set-up I have ever seen. It provides snap shots of all of the Russian regions, with models that are of high detail, & also with plenty of humour. We did two tours around the complex to take in all of the detail & spent about 2 hours there. I think it goes without saying that kids would love it. But it was pretty good for a couple of 50 year olds as well."

It is quite limited when it comes to interaction -just pressing some buttons to light a few places or move some things but to get a general view of Russia it's a good introduction. Also good for school children or students who are interested in Russian culture and geography."

Its super-realistic model of all of Russia blew my mind with its detailed and candid depiction, including a hidden production site (\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434) and an area labelled desolation (\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0443\u0445\u0430), all criss-crossed by endless numbers of moving trains. It is perhaps the most educational museum I have ever seen, teaching you about the culture, geography and economy of Russia in most compelling ways, including the pattern of day and night across the country. Dads can relive their affinity for model train sets as this is as big a train set as you will ever encounter. Just a few subway stops from the city center, this gem is an absolute must!"

This out-of-the-way museum is a hidden pearl of St. Petersburg, so if you have time in between your visits to all those obligatory sites, take a trip to this museum. It give you a great picture of Russia endorsed with stereotypes, generalizations and main attractions of every region. Some of the spots are interactive, which means you can press a button to make the little figurines perform some action. The miniature Russia is not done yet and is being built every day. If you take a close look, you will see memorable little scenes where the plastic people are living their lives, having good times and bad. There is even a miniature of the museum itself inside the museum! If you ask the personnel, they will tell you more about the project, but take care not to get to close to it or they will yell at you."

A big building, very clean (you just clean your shoes before entering), with a nice Russian self service restaurant and then the exhibition. An enormous room with the miniature of the entire Russia. I think there were more than 5000 little men an women and a hundred trains all running through the room and the sceneries are really detailed. All personnel is very kind and explains how it was made"

I cannot even put into words the amount of fascination for which we all felt upon first sight of this extraordinary display of time, detail, and workmanship. You cannot help but be completely engaged as soon as you see it. I have never seen anything like it, especially of this scale, any where in the world. There is no fanfare leading up to it. The parking lot was quiet and it almost seemed as though they were not that interested in having visitors. The gift shop is small so don't worry about a big sales pitch. Just go and enjoy the most detailed model of Russia that can only be described as pure Genius!!"

I also wanted toy trains as a child and the place have many of them. Houses, mountains, animals, trees and snow. Cars and trucks on the move. Buses moving in orbits stoping at stations and continue. And above all trains. Passenger trains and freight trains. Getting in and out of tunnels, Stoping in red lights and starting again. A real pleasure."

In case you'd love to travel throughout Russia but have no time/money/courage - Grand Maket is the right place to visit :) It is not the geographic model - so don't expect cities and adjusted to scale landscapes. But it shows railroads & roads, industrial sites, mountains & rivers and so on. The essence is - gallery of typical Russian life scenes that are made with great attention to details. You'll see air modelling, coal mine works, a prison, deers' pasture, Sochi ski resorts, paintball, hiking, country side houses, harvesting, garage (even with a graffity on it's wall!) and so on, and so on. Don't expect here history or cultural items, but be ready to turn into a child for three hours!"

Every possible aspect of life is on display here, from nature to cities, industries to transportation, people working to relaxing. The attention to detail is absolutely incredible!Museum is a 10 minute walk from Moskovskii Vorota (Moscow gate) Metro, costs 450 rubles (about 11 euros) for an adult to enter, all bags must be checked, and photography is free. Beware, the place was very busy when I was there, and there were lots and lots of kids, which made it feel claustrophobic at times. In fact, I would have stayed longer if it weren't for the crowd.If you have kids, I definitely recommend bring them here, but it is truly an amazing exhibition for all ages."

You could spend all day here and still not see all the cool details that have been worked into the scenery. The more you pay attention to the details, the more you'll be rewarded. All in all, the Grand Maket is sure to be a hit with the kids or make you feel like a kid again. A nice bonus is the command center where all the automation is monitored. Also be sure to pick up a picture book for a few bucks (not advertised, just ask)!"

But this exibitions offers perfect opportunity to have slight look at the every part of the country!Don't expect every detail will be realistic and exact copy of the originals. No - to do it they would have to build the museum equal to the city by it's size! Lots of installations are schematic. But still it is amazing to watch \"sun goes down\" above plastick country in the right side of the showroom and already \"comes up\" in the left side! More than that. The installations are not static! Trains are moving, farmers are working and the lights turn on when \"the night comes\"! Really cool! St.Peresburg is represented on the biggest part of the maket and this one is the small copy of the most famous city's attractions!You can take pictures without any additional price! Worth seeing!"
