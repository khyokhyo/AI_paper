This is a very interesting basilica located in the Pest city area very near to the Opera House. it's very huge with a seating capacity of around 8000 persons. Inside the basilica, by the chapel one can find the mummified fore arm of St Stephen who was the first king of Hungary. It's very rich in architecture, marble and stained glass. This basilica can be seen from many areas of Budapest due its very tall cupola. To enter the basilica one has to make a donation of HUF 200. If one is not afraid of going up some 300 steps to the very top, you can admire the surroundings and take marvelous pictures from the top. I recommend a visit of this basilica."

Entry to the cathedral is by modest donation but you can go up to an outside gallery at the base of the the dome for another couple of pounds - either walk up the winding stairs or use the lifts which take you virtually to the top.While not quite in the class of some Italian basilicas, views over the city and beyond to the Buda hills are wonderful - made better by low-rise planning policies which mean St Stephen's is one of the tallest buildings. Also no long queues when we were there in late September, so worth a visit."

If you're ambitious you can climb to the top (well over 300 steps) and you have to pay. The entrance to the basilica is not free; a donation of 200 florint pp is expected and a priest is sitting right by the entrance to watch what you're doing. Wonderful paintings, stained glass, marble and you name it abound. It's a neo-Romanesque structure that dates back to 1868. Quite a few steps to get up to the entrance. Impressive doors. Guided tours are available. Watch for announcements re. evening organ recitals."

St. Stephen's Basilica is an impressive sight, set beautifully in a cobblestone square with several cafes and restaurants and ice cream carts. Admittance is free, even though a small fee is strongly recommended. However, it will cost you 500 florints to go up to the tower. The inside is richly decorated with gold and red marble. The biggest attraction however may be the famous relic stored here, the mummified hand of allegedly St. Stephen himself. Signs all over the basilica point to a side chapel on the left side, and a gold, glass paneled box where the hand rests. For a few florints, the visitor can illuminate the shrine and better see the relic. A panel explains the long history of the possession of the relic and how it finally came to the basilica. We weren't about to put money in, but right in front of us a class of small schoolchildren on a field trip lit up the shrine and we couldn't help to look. Naturally, we were respectful but for us, it was very difficult to understand the attraction of the shriveled hand. I wouldn't go just to see the hand, but the church is beautiful."

The St Stephen's Basilica is a beautiful Roman Catholic cathedral built in honour of the first king of Hungary, Stephen, and completed in 1905, having taken over half a century to construct. It is a Neo-Classical style with the large central dome supported by two large bell towers to the front elevation overlooking an expansive square. It really is a beautiful building set within the heart of the Pest side of the cit. The bell towers and dome are visible from Castle Hill on the Buda side of the River Danube. It is very much high on the list of buildings and sights to see in this wonderful city. Get inside if you can as the decoration and interior is superb."

The main Basilica is free however there is the option to make a suggested donation which most people do. There are elements of the Basilica that do require payment to view but these are all reasonable and you can choose which ones you want to see. You can take photos but not with flash and they take the silence requirement seriously. The architecture is wonderful as is the art work. It also has the slightly morbid addition of the mummified had on St. Stephen."

This is a magnificently restored Catholic Church in the heart of the old Pest side of Budapest. It was damaged, badly, in WW II, but the artisans and restorative teams did a superb job restoring it. I highly recommend that anyone visiting Budapest should definitely get to see this church!"

There is an entrance fee, which is disguised as a donation. No one really checks which coin you drop in to the box, but you are expected to pay 200 forint or 2 euros. The best part of my visit was walking upstairs to the panorama view on top of the dome. It costs a little extra, but it was definitely worth it!"

The interior is beautiful and with the addition of the tremendous pipe organ and violoncello playing Mozart and other pieces, it was a spectacular experience. .Some parts of the Basilica were closed off, so we did not get to see the withered hand of St. Istvan, but it was nice to sit and relax and hear such beautiful music. The concert was not that expensive, possibly since it was just the organ and one woman playing the violoncello, so well worth the price."

It is worth it to go to the small chapel at the back of the church to see the shrine for the relic of St Stephen's hand. The mummified hand is within an old reliquary, which in turn is within a newer reliquary - very interesting to see. - but don't expect to have a good view of the hand itself. Pay the small fee to climb to the viewing platform at the base of the dome - there is also an elevator, but we walked. There are numerous stairs, and be aware that some of the staircases are very narrow and steep with two-way traffic. In addition to views of the city from the terrace, you also can see the interior of the dome, which is really interesting. All in all, a must-see site in Budapest!"

You won't believe how impressive this church is until you actually approach it from the outside -- it is beautiful. The sculptural and mural programs inside and out are very fine, and there is lovely stained glass. It all works together to leave you truly immersed in beauty.

Check out when all you can see the holy right hand. It will not be displayed all time. When illuminated, the interior of church beauty multiplies. During prayer times visitors are resticted to the back benches. Very nice atmosphere and you will really love the peace in air. There is also paid Panoramic view from cupola,enjoy if you have time"

It is not named after the martyr Stephen who was stoned to death with Paul of Tarsus watching the proceedings. This Stephen united 7 nomad tribes that had taken up residence in the general area of Budapest or at least Hungary (there is a statue to the Seven Leaders of the tribes in Heroes Square). He was also responsible for bringing the Catholic Church to Hungary. For this he was eventually Sainted (as I understand it, this sainting happened very quickly (kinda like Catholic fast tracking) without the usual waiting period.) The entire basilica is dedicated to Stephen. The only place you find a picture or image of Jesus is on a side alcove. I found this strange. The church itself is very pretty and I think it is worth a visit. For me 15 minutes and I moved on. So visit but have a plan for your day because you may have more time on your hands than you thought."

Although cheap compared to some other religious sights in Budapest the \"donation\" is actually compulsory and you're watched like a hawk as you put your money on the \"donation\" box. On top of that you have to pay extra to go up the lift to the dome, although after buying tickets nobody once checked to see if we'd paid or not. I didn't mind the extra cost for the dome as the views are really nice and make for great photo opportunities. What I did have a problem with though is paying extra to shine a light on the box that contains the mummified hand - one of the main reasons I, and I suspect many others visit. I don't remember seeing or hearing about this extra cost at all until I actually got to the box. On top of that the box is so intricately designed that there's barely enough glass to see the inside of the box anyway, plus it's at least a meter or so away behind a barrier. Really annoying and a bit of a con if I'm honest. I'd rather the entrance \"donation\" actually be slightly more expensive and the venue be open as honest but hey, it's the church were talking about here, it's all money!Go up to the dome though, I recommend it! Great views."

At least once you have to climb up and admire the city. There are a number of glass windows made by Miksa Roth that are very beautiful.

Chances are that you'll be probably standing the highest in Budapest (at least the Pest side)The Basilica and the Parliament building are equally 96 m tall, (it has some symbolic aspects too) and they are by law the tallest buildings in Budapest.

The main entrance is dominated by the inscription \" I am the Way, the Truth and the Life\" but as it is in Latin I think most visitors will miss the importance and impact of this quote. Even on a sunny 30 C day it was worth paying 500 HUF to climb the basilica and get a great view of Budapest and admire all the buildings with their different roofs. The entrance to the church is free but a donation gets a smile of appreciation."

That's probably the most interesting part of the church. Pay another 500 ft to go up to the top of the basilica for the panoramic view. Skip the stairs and take the lift (small so you have to queue a bit). The best view is towards the river and the castle area, which is to the west, so go on the morning to take the best pictures.

However, this is because the owners prefer to have someone stand at the entrance door forcing visitors to \"donate\", instead of selling regular tickets (and handle the income transparently). Feel free to insist on getting a ticket if you do not support procedures that are not transparent. Also note that for candles, the price is 200 HUF or 1 Euro (=315 HUF), meaning the price in forints is 2/3 of the price in euro."

The view from the top of the tower is incredible, giving you a good view of Pest and the Buda hills (you won't see the Danube but there are plenty of other places in the city to see it!). A reasonable price at 500 forint each, there are about 300 ish steps to climb but I believe you can take two lifts up - we walked all the way up, and then took one lift halfway down. The steps on the second part are a bit rickety so if you're s bit afraid of heights you might want to take the lifts!We visited as the sun was starting to set, casting a lovely glow over the city! It wasn't too busy either. Would recommend!"

The stairs are quite narrow and I think there's around 300 of them so I'd recommend getting the lift.

The architecture is awe-inspiring and the view from the top is the best in the city. Incredible views of the Parlament, the Buda Castle, the river, Pest etc. It's easily accessible by public transportation (go to the Arany Janos utca stop with the blue metro or take the yellow line to Bajcsy-Zsilinszky u.). With lots of restaurants and gift shops nearby, the area is almost too touristy but with Budapest being a living, breathing city, there is no shortage of locals going about their daily business either. The walk up to the dome might be challenging to some, but my 10 yr old had no problems whatsoever. I believe there is an elevator as well, at least to a portion of the way up. Once up there, there's plenty of space to stop and take photos and the \"railing\" is a solid, thick stone wall, so most will feel safe even that high up. The treasury is interesting but if you're short on time, this is the part to skip. The interior is gorgeous of course and if you're lucky you might even witness a wedding like we did.Entrance to the basilica is free but you need to purchase a ticket to go up the dome and a separate ticket to see the treasury."

I didn't went inside because it was closed in the evening and I regret it now. Exterior is really stunning. Main frontal part (looking from the square) reminds on Pantheon in Athena, like all neo-classical buildings. I noticed that the pillars are made in all 3 main classical styles. You can see Ionic, Doric and Corinthian capitels (top pillar tips) if you pay attention. And, of course, there is a dome, which is piece of art for itself. It's one of the tallest buildings in Budapest, so if you are lost in the city centre, just look for the towers and you will probably know where you are."

If you've not been to Buda or been to the top of any other buildings then the bell tower is a must for the view of the city. It's a long walk up (parts of it can be managed by lift) and for height phobics not the place to be \u2013 the last part of the climb inside the tower on metal exposed stairs seemed particularly scary!!

So it was important for us to visit this beautiful Cathedral . However, the many steps were overwhelming at first. But thanks to the perseverance of my friend, we discovered that there are lifts for wheelchairs. People do not always speak English in Budapest, so it may take a bit of an effort. But it is worth it. We actually went through the Catacombs and up another lift to the Church. The Basilica was magnificent. It is hard to take it all in. We even got to see the Relic hand of St. Steven which was returned to the Church on August 19, 1945. We did not climb the 360 steps to the top."

This is a wonderful place to visit whether you're religious or not.The paintings and architecture are amazing and could probably not be replicated today. If you decide to take in the fantastic views from the top of the cathedral be prepared for a lengthy wait if you go at a busy time. You pay a nominal amount at a kiosk and then walk along to a tiny lift which takes you to a large upper level. From here you walk around to another even smaller lift to take you to the next level. You then walk up some metal stairs leading to the outside, where you can walk around the upper part of the building. The trip took around 40 mins from queueing to go up and then back down again.I would not recommend this for anyone with mobility issues."

Szent Istv\u00e1n-bazilika\u2014Hungarian for Saint Stephen Bazilika\u2014is the largest Catholic church in Budapest, and was the sixth largest church building in Hungary before 1920. WWII saw the destruction of many phenomenal cathedrals, and this basilica is now the third largest church building in present-day Hungary. It is named to honor Stephen, the first King of Hungary (975\u20131038AD). It is one of the two tallest buildings in Budapest at 315 feet. It is 180 feet wide and 287 feet long. After 54 years of construction, it was completed in 1905, a time comparable to the Wright Brothers\u2019 first flight. The architectural style is Neoclassical and the fa\u00e7ade is complemented by two large bell towers. The largest bell weights over nine tons. Climb up 264 stairs for a commanding view of Budapest."

No, they performed with baritone and flute on a powerful (but still inadequate) electronic organ near the altar with hidden speakers. There are no pipes in the front of the basilica. I've heard excellent recitals in much smaller churches all over Budapest and Prague which simply eclipsed the performance quality of this 8.00 pm (un-advertised) debacle.Awful and most forgettable.

We suppose that the organist avoids lesser-known works so people won't be disappointed. Just in case you don't know, you will sit facing the front of the church and the organ and soloist will be behind you. Since we were close to the front, we actually could see the organist a bit. You will not be able to wander around the church afterward (they were getting ready for mass and hurried everyone out), so you should go see the church earlier in the day.It was nice to appreciate the Basilica while listening to fantastic music."

His right hand or Holy Dexter called the 'Szent Jobb' is preserved in a reliquary which can be viewed in the Basilica. While his body decayed his right hand was found preserved when his coffin was opened. He died in 1038 and was made a saint in 1083.The Basilica of St Stephen has a statue of him behind the main altar. The third largest church in Hungary was completed in 1905 after 54 years of building. It is reminiscent of St Peter's in Rome with its marble colums, gold decorations and imposing dome which is as tall as the Parliament building, 96 metres. 1896 being the year when the Millenium celebrations took place to celebrate the entry of the Hungarians lead by Arpad and his seven chieftains a thousand years previously.The large forecourt of the Basilica is also very beautiful. It helps to see the building from a distance to appreciate its beauty. For people in wheelchairs there is a glass lift on the left hand side of the Basilica with a communication button to call an attendant who will take you down in the lift, guide you past the many marked repositories for people's ashes, to the lift which arrives at a level entry into the church. This lift also takes people up to an observation platform for views of the city."

The location is perfect for a day's tourist activity.Supposedly the right hand of St. Stephen is in a special chapel in the cathedral. There is great history and folklore with the hand of not only St. Stephen, but also the body parts of many great men of history!One of the highlights is to take the elevator to the dome level of the cathedral.

(earlier the day, we were at Mattias Church where you could walk from there to here)The church building was massive, grand and lovely, magnificent and gorgeous. Perhaps its architectural theme is a combination between gothic and renaissance style. When we were there, there were a huge turnout of visitors and a wedding couple who were taking their marriage portfolios. Lovely!Upon entering the church (we were advised by our guide to offer a small token of donation though its free admission), we were greatly impressed with the interior layout and structure and what we saw. Very nice and awesome lightings and colourful window glasses, statues, paintings, exhibits and got so much to see as each had a story or biblical background to tell, shamed that we did not have the luxury of time to see everything, Some of the items were actually made in golden and that reflected well from their colour shine. For Catholics, I will think they will like and enjoy this place as they can find \"closeness\" to the saints and God.Well, you can also visit the top of the church building (dome) and chargeable where you could have a good view on the city. Photography is allowed inside the church but with no flash and whispering is a must since it is opened to public for prayer.Just right outside the church is known as St Stephen's Square, a place where cafes, restaurants, souvenir shops are located and you can grab some gifts to take home or relax over a cup of coffee before heading to your next destination.Highly recommended."

Apparently it is the tallest building in Budapest, same height as the Hungarian Parliament Building. It has an interesting story with several architects, a dome collapse and even a World War II military period. We used the Rick Steves\u2019 guide to do the self-tour. It has two towers with several bells. The views of the city are very impressive. The \u201crelic\u201d of St. Istv\u00e1n\u2019s hand is housed in the Basilica. The display case lights up when someone puts coins in. We had fortunate timing in seeing a few curious tourists pay to turn it on and were able to catch a quick glimpse."

(free but with requested donation in cash) But the real show-stopper was the 302 stair climb (yes, they have an elevator) up to the dome. This brings you up to the outside of the dome where you get the most spectacular panoramic views of the city. You can walk all the way around and get wonderful shots of the castle, parliament, fisherman's bastion, and the other city sights. A great way to gain your bearings around the city as well and a wonderful surprise. It's about 500 forints I believe to go up (about $2 when I went) and well worth it. Very inexpensive for the views you get."

They don't check the ticket when you get on the elevator but when you arrive upstairs they do. So make sure to have them. 500 for an adult, 400 for a student. Visiting church itself is basically a \"donation\" of 200 ft. If you go deep down the church, they have St jobbs hand displayed in a room. It's not magnificent church but sure it's beautiful. I've seen too many churches in Europe."

With that said, it was a crazy interesting place to people watch! Bodies from around the world In every imaginable shape and size. The outdoor pools were in good shape and clean but the indoor facilities like the locker area and changing room were old and just felt kind of dirty.

Take time to walk around the whole interior, including the chapel at the rear. Beautiful statues and stained glass windows are a feature. To have a great overview of the city you can pay a small entrance fee and climb many steps up to the dome where there is a walkway around the entire church offering 360 degrees of Budapest. Well worth a visit even if you have seen many other churches in Europe."

The players and the counter tenor sounded amazing with the acoustics. If you have never heard a church organ live, then this is the place to do it. I thought it could have been louder but all in all, it is something to feel.A very special place and a popular venue for tourists. Don't miss it."

It's excellent on both counts.As a church, we only had a peek as there was a private service on. It's grand and ornate and they only ask for a small (and voluntary) donation of 200 HUF (about 50p - or less than one euro) to go in.We spent more time enjoying the views of the city from the balcony outside its lofty dome. To go up you pay at a ticket window just to the right of the main church entrance. It's 500 Forints (less than \u00a31.50) and it's a long spiral staircase up. There seemed to be a lift too at the opposite side of the church entrance to the pay desk, just behind the souvenir kiosk. But don't think it was working when we went. There's also a space half way up with a few low key arty things and another small lift - that goes up only.It's quite a climb unless you're fit but well worth it. Great views of the city in every direction as you can walk all the way around. It's the highest vantage point available and a brilliant way to get a sense of the city.It feels safe enough to take kids (with energetic legs!) up. Busy but not too crowded when went up late on a Saturday afternoon in June. And a complete bargain too."

Breathtaking ambience, huge space, organ music, frankincence in the air - we stayed amazed .Entry is free of charge, for 500 HUF (approx 1,5 \u20ac) you can visit a tower - upstairs will reach you above cupola of duomo (crazy feeling - you can still hear the organ music from there) and nothing compares the view from the tower."

            "review": "Must Visit!. One of the highlights of our visit to Budapest. Entrance to the main parts of the basilica is free. Be aware that they close off the center entry when weddings are scheduled, however, you can still see the insides of the basilica and the chapel located in the rear (left) using the two side aisle entrances. Another interesting part of the Basilica visit is the climb to the observation deck around the dome. Tickets for that are sold in a recess just outside the entrance on the right side for about HUF 3000. There are two ways to get upstairs. The simplest way is to climb the spiral staircase right next to the ticket booth up to the 3rd floor and the take another spiral staircase to the very top. This could be physically demanding for some people, but most can make it with short breaks along the way. The view inside the structure of the dome is also photo worthy. Once at the top, there is a 360 degrees observation deck around the outside which gives you a beautiful view of the entire city. The clock tower chimes on the hour. There is also a large square in front. There are also two elevators (on either sides of the entrance) that can take you up to the 3rd floor, then you change to a second elevator which takes you all the way up, but I cannot confirm this second part. The capacity of these elevators is only 6 or 8 passengers and the lines are long. The other interesting thing (sorry to to digress) is that there is a lovely gelato store called Rosa Gelato on the left side of the Basilica as you exit the front side. It's next to a money change shop with a right red sign. By the way that exchange shop gives excellent exchange rates. The gelato store is known for its servings of gelato shaped like a ROSE with multiple colors/flavors! It costs HUF 600 for two flavors and HUF 700 for 3 flavors. Have your phone video recorder ready to capture how they make these works of art! I found the pistachio flavor to be the best one, yum! Enjoy."

The entrance is free but a donation box is there requesting a minimum of 1 euro for renovation contributions. Inside the columns /pillars are of high quality brown marble with \"gold \" fixtures al around .ceilings all around are very impressive , and so are the multiple 6-8feet statues all around the churches. Photography is allowed and there is a history of the church (in English & Hungarian) at the exit door inside the church.Outside the \"square\" is big and nicely decorated. There is a nice souvenir shop nearby with a very large variety of products. Also the exchange bureau has good rates for forex."

However, the door was on the opposite side of the building from where the taxi dropped us. For a moment we were confused by the tickets for sale at the entrance. These were not, however, for entering the basilica but were tickets for a concert which was to be held there that evening. Entering the basilica, we were stunned by the beauty before us. Entry is free but there is a suggested donation of 1 euro. I was surprised that photography was allowed in the basilica. I might have been better prepared if I had realised that it was since the low level of light but brightly illuminated works of art make photography tricky. The whole basilica is beautiful and everywhere you look is stunning. The many works of art around the basilica deserve a close look - take time to see them. Look up from under the dome to get a real feeling of splendour. Of course, the basilica has many visitors who come to see its beauty but some sit in quiet prayer. Despite the many visitors there is a feeling of peace in the basilica."

The classical design in the shape of a cross, is extensively decorated by frescoes, statues, oil paintings and stucco work. It has great acoustics and is the site of frequent concerts. It houses and excellent organ and the crypt has a great collection of sacred objects. The facade is framed by two bell towers, providing absolute symmetry. In front of the church, there is a large square. There is an excellent observation deck around the dome, accessible by elevator or a vary long staircase (364 stairs). Since the Basilica is one of the tallest buildings in the city, the deck provides excellent view of the city and especially Buda, across the river."

In a side chapel they had the remnant of the hand of a saint. It's not much to see being encased in a gold casket but worth a look. The real purpose of visiting should be to go to the top of the dome. This costs around \u00a31.35. You can either climb the steps or take the lift for the same price. Take the lift but beware there are still a few steps to climb to get outside onto the walkway around the dome. Once you are there the view of the surrounding area is well worth it."

First king of Hungary, Istv\u00e1n I (or Stephen) devoted himself to the Christianization of the Magyarab people (people who lives along the Nile River in Egypt and Sudan). He founded several monasteries and was sanctified. This is his Basilica. Huge, with capacity for over 8000 people. The most important church in Budapest (along with the building of the Hungarian Parliament) is also the tallest building in the capital (96 m). The number 96 symbolizes the arrival of the Hungarians in the Carpathian basin in the year 896. The church was built in the 19th century in neoclassical style. Although it\u2019s called as Basilica, it\u2019s more like a Greek church in a cross shape. It offers a beautiful view from the top of its dome. In recent years, the Basilica has another function as well: nowadays St. Stephen Basilica is also the Budapest Cathedral."

At 10 is became very obvious where they were, right by the main entrance!We took the stairs and it wasn't too bad. I suffer from a touch of vertigo and it was only the last couple of sets of metal stairs that were difficult as you could see the height most clearly.The view was stunning and it wasn't that busy when we went between 9.30 and 10.30 on a Monday morning."

The inside is actually breath-taking and well worth a look if you have time to do so. The structure is incredible and the art work on the inside along with the marble and gold has a real wow factor about it. We then paid to go up to the balcony on the tower - I mean this was just ok the views aren't bad but they aren't anything particularly spectacular to be honest so you wouldn't be missing much if you didn't pay to do this. The only reason it was slightly better for us is the fact that the air show was going on at the time so we got a good view of that! In all seriousness though we had a better view from Bar 360 when we had pre dinner drinks the previous day! Do go inside the Basilica though because this is the real treat and it's completely free!"

Why doesn't she tell you? Because she has a \"don't care\" attitude and doesn't have any customer service skills. Also there are no signs anywhere to show you that there is a lift to the top. Horrible, retro, incompetence that shouldn't exist in such a central and beautiful location. This is typical retro Hungarian mis-management and staff / management incompetence. Also the lift to the very top of the building is too small and looks dangerous and old. It is also incredibly poorly labeled, there are no signs anywhere, and it is incredibly hot in summer.This is a beautiful building but be prepared for some bad service with outdated and incompetent staff who don't care about visitors."

Originally was drawn to the outer art works (sculpture, details, etc.), but wanted to make sure I saved a couple hours to go in before leaving. SO HAPPY I DID!!I went in around noon and spent a couple hours immersed in this beautiful masterpiece. Upon entering there are so many incredible works of art to absorb. The ceiling is incredible and I am so happy I happened to fall right next to this space during my stay in Budapest as not too sure I would have known to go otherwise (was here for work and did not do my usual research as would not have too much time to explore).A must visit/see for sure!"

Wonderful exterior architectural elements and observation deck accessible by elevator plus stairs to the rooftop. After seeing the interior alters, be sure to enter the private chapel to the extreme left of the main alter where you can view the actual hand of St Stephen found intact 50yrs following his death & canonization. It's wall mounted in a glass box and not particularly easy to view but very exciting to say you were there standing right in front of it! A must-see sight. Don't miss the adjacent roof top lounge at the Aria Hotel, music themed boutique property a sight in itself, where you can get some fabulous photos with Basilica very close in the background. Outdoor bar with comfy lounge chairs and heaters are worth the price of coffees or drinks. It's Budapest...make those memories!"

I found myself captivated by the beauty of the church throughout the mass. A few steps from the basilica is a Starbucks, some souvenir shops, and a lot of places to eat."

This is a beautiful building from the outside, and the inside is adorned with just as beautiful statues and icons. But, for me, the best part is when you climb, and I do mean climb, to the roof of St Stephens Basilica. The views are breathtaking from this vantage point, from the flat built up historic Pest right below you, to the more mountainous Buda across the river with its castle and numerous churches. If in Busapest, take a bottle of water and a mars bar and make the climb. Well worth it."

The best place to have a coffee around is the corner Starbucks, where you can sit and have a direct view to the church.Also, many other cute stores are located around, where someone can find souvenirs, clothes, books, etc. We recommend the Bestsellers bookstore which is very close to the Basilica, where you can find English language books.All in all, make sure you visit Basilica in case you are in Budapest."

The concert started at around 5:00 pm and lasted approximately 45 minutes and it was just breathtaking, the soulful music that was playing was just amazing. I think it was actually my first time going to an organ concert and I'm really glad I went to it. I actually came back to the basilica the next day so I could go up the tower. You have to buy a ticket to go up but again it wasn't too much, to get to the top you will have to climb I think it was 364 steps but it so worth it as the view from the top was absolutely stunning.

She asked us if we were from England and when we said yes, she proceeded to tell us how she couldn't afford to eat and hadn't had shelter in a while, it was quite a lengthy plea but as we had given a donation to enter we had no change to give her. She pestered us for a while until moving on to others. I don't know if it's a common thing there, but perhaps bear this in mind!It didn't take away anything from the experience however, and it's well worth a look around if you like architecture, culture and history."

We showed our ticket when we got out of the lift to be greeted by the staff member literally screaming in our faces that it was only for panorama. We tried to explain that we were informed that it was for both but she continued shouting at us and was extremely confrontational. When we got back to the main entrance, we checked the ticket boards in more detail and we discovered that we did actually need separate tickets for both attractions (note to anyone who is planning on visiting the basilica). We know we made a mistake, probably due to a language barrier however the way the woman in the treasury spoke to us made us leave immediately and not purchase the ticket to go back up to the treasury due to her rudeness as we most certainly would have done in another circumstance. A beautiful building but a disappointing end to the visit. The building in itself is a 5/5, the staff on this occasion would be lucky to get a 2/5."

Brilliant views of Budapest and surrounding area from the Tower, worth the 302 steps up. Stunning, architecture, plenty of gilding. Nice to sit on the steps outside and watch the world go by. Attended an evening concert in the Basilica, 6000 HUF ( in the cheap seats ) for about an hour's music of God's Greatest Hits played /sung by 5 soloists; a worthwhile experience and this performance seemed a regular feature for each week."

It doesn't seem to take up a huge amount of space on the ground and yet it is quite awe inspiring in size. It must be because of the height of the dome and the accompanying towers. Entrance into the church is free (suggested donation is 200 flt). It is beautiful inside and even forgetting some of the masterpieces around the individual chapels, the ceiling is glorious. And the mummified hand is something that my children thoroughly enjoyed!We paid to to visit both the Treasury - which is a small collection of the church's silver and some of the bishops' robes etc. If you are interested in church regalia, it would probably be of interest. The main feature though is the view from the rotunda. You need to buy a ticket - I think it was about 350 flt - and then you either take the 302 steps to the top or go up in the lift. There are two sets of steps and two lifts and even taking the lift still requires taking a few more steps to the top, so it isn't accessible to the infirm. But when you do get there - wow! The views are spectacular. Absolutely a must do if you're in Budapest."

Having experienced St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna and the hoards of people inside and outside, I wasn't so sure how I was going to feel about St. Stephen's in Budapest. If you are like me and visited Vienna before Budapest, wipe everything from your mind about St. Stephen's in Vienna because St. Stephens of Budapest is completely different - it's a much better and much more spiritual experience.First off, the crowds are nothing compared to Vienna. You actually have room to breathe and reflect in this church. You have room to move around and take in the stunning beauty of the church. The architecture is fabulous, and the church is much easier to revel in. This is a must visit in Budapest.I'd highly recommend going up to the top of the tower to take in views of Budapest. You can take an elevator most of the way, or you can really be adventurous and climb the stairs the entire way. We did the stairs. The stairs can be a bit narrow and nerve-wracking if someone is coming the alternate direction, but just move aside and hold your breath, and you'll be fine if you're afraid of heights like I am. You can spend a lot of time at this church. It's more than a quick visit location, and fits in to a day trip in Budapest, or a several day trip. We merged this in with a visit to Parliament and the Central Market, and walked the whole way. It was a great addition to our trip and a highly memorable spot."

You get a great panoramic view of the city! Just be warned that there are a lot of stairs to walk up (and majority of them are in form of a spiral staircase!) It's free to go in but they do recommend that you make a donation (there is a man sitting next to the donation box so you feel you have to donate - the recommended amount was incredibly cheap though)."

There was a Christmas market outside the Basilica and we had warmed up across the square with a hot chocolate before entering. The architecture is stunning and there was still a Nativity displayed inside. We lit a candle for a friend from church who had recently had major surgery and reflected on how fortunate we were to be in this building - despite there being lots of people around us it was possible to have a quiet time and reflect and take in the works of art - wonderful."

There is so much detail throughout the building and while inside you just find yourself walking around looking up at the ceilings the whole time.You can also go up to the top for a panoramic view of the city, however I didn't end up doing this as there was a bit of a queue to go up.You can also go and see St Stephens hand which I though sounded a bit strange. When you enter the room there are several pews looking toward the hand which is held inside a glass case. You can't really see the hand until you pay to light it up which I think is a bit ridiculous. It can be argued that they don't have the light on all the time to help with its preservation, however the way it lights up makes it look like something at a fairground.Admittedly this wasn't something that interested me but for those that are more religious, I imagine it is very interesting."

I have travelled to Venice and Barcelona and seen plenty of impressive Holy buildings, this is in my top 3. As its relatively new the colours and gold leaf are in perfect condition adding to the beauty.

It's really cheap, unlike some other churches in Europe, and offers spectacular views of Budapest. The inside is similarly beautiful, a large area that makes the interior decorations really lovely."

Start walking straight inland from the Chain Bridge. You\u2019ll have to get across a small grassy island and then on to the street ahead of you. Then the Basilica slowly emerges at the vanishing point where the two sides of the street converge. Also the best time to visit it \u2013 again in my opinion \u2013 is near sunset when the facade of the building glows in the magical golden light. The Basilica is one of the five ubiquitous structures in Budapest which can be seen almost from anywhere in the city, the others being the Hungarian Parliament which along with the Basilica are located in Pest, and the Buda Castle and Fisherman\u2019s Bastion along with St Matthias Church are located in Buda. The church is named after Saint Stephen I of Hungary, the first King of Hungary (c. 975\u20131038), whose \"incorruptible\" right hand is said to be housed in the reliquary. You can actually view the relic. The building was completed in 1905 after 54 years of construction. It is one the two tallest buildings in Budapest, the other one being the Parliament building. The number of tourists flowing through the marvellous interior makes it rather difficult to sit for a quiet prayer. That being said, I went there almost every evening for two weeks and sat for half an hour of bliss. Whether you\u2019re a religious person, or a lover of architecture or student of history or an inspired photographer the Basilica will not let you leave empty handed"

I was more than pleased to have the opportunity to re-visit this amazing building. All I can say is don't overlook the Basilica as a tourist destination on your visit to Budapest. Even if you are not religious, the interior architecture and decoration is so breath-taking and the acoustics are to die for. My very favourite area is a small side chapel where the relic of Stephen's hand is situated (I think that is what it is!) The reason I love this so much is the stain glass windows. You really should go and look at them. They are worth the visit without the splendour of the main Basilica, with its gold leaf and marble statues.I would love to have the chance to attend a concert here; I can imagine that it would be magnificent.

They charge entrance to church (plus you can leave donation, which is silly if you already paid them) and cupola (view of the city). I would say they charge it too much! More beautiful attractions in Budapest are more affordable.Plus, the view is not as stunning as from Castle Hill or Buda Castle.You can look at it from outside square and it would be enough to experience it."

It's definitely not the donation suggestion that bothered me but the fact that someone is watching you pay \"your donation\". Also the entrance to the other treasury and lift will require additional fees. A view from the top is most likely the best attraction. Too commercial for me."

Beautiful and well-maintained, this Basilica venerating Hungary's beloved St. Stephen is easy to reach via the beautiful plaza. Enormous inside, visit the many side altars until you reach the actual resting place of St. Stephen's hand, the only part of his body that was ever found. Sounds macabre, but is history. You may even pay a few forint to have a light briefly shine on the hand. Beautiful church, unique story, light a candle, say a prayer, make your wish, just don't miss this beautiful landmark!"

Despite its beauty and amazing organ siund what disturbed me the most was the ongoing movement and clicking sound of cameras. When I walked in there was a service of some sort going on. Although the tourists were, including myslef, quiet it did not make me feel too good about this place of worship. If you love architecture its a must. But I am not sure about visiting during a service. But then that might just be me."

The cathedral's prize possession is the Holy Right Hand of Saint Stephen, housed in a marvelous little golden reliquary, which can be spot-lit by inserting a few coins into a machine. It is well worth a visit. I walked by one Sunday, when there was a small procession around the building, with loudspeaker music and a man throwing rose petals down from the upper balcony."

Situated near the metro station of Deack Ferencz is one of the great basilic that I saw, you can go in for free but if you want the see the city from the top of the basilica you can do it for about 3 euro. In the front of the Basilica is know a very nice Cristmas Market with local food and wine."

Very Impressive. The view is somehat obscured by the Christmas Fair there throgh Jan !, but then again the market offers other possibilities for eating, drinking and browsing.The Basilica itself offers the backdrop fro a multi-media display flashing on the edifice. The interior is beautiful- brighter than many in Europe. A trip to the top offers impressive views.There are many affordable, quality and healthy eating options within a short walk On Oct 6 utca there is a Hummus Bar and Pad Thai restaurants- highly recommended. For the best steaks in Bp, there is KNRDY restaurant, though be prepared to pay for the privilge of your tender succulent steak, chop or seafood. Worth it if you can pay."

Would recommend that you pay the additional money (can't remember exactly how much but honestly it was no more than a couple of euros) to go up to the viewing platform, you can take the stairs or be lazy like me and catch the lift. So worthwhile to do this as not only is the view from the top breathtaking but you also get to see the inside of the building - including the 'fake dome'. TIP - go at sunset as I got some beautiful shots of the sun setting behind Castle Hill with the city in the foreground and if you can be bothered to stay up there for long enough you'll experience the view in dusk and when the city lights come on"

Visiting this church is a humbling experience. Viewing the religious Relic is even more astounding. Viewing the Relic requires 2 forint coins and will illuminate the Relic for a short period of time. Enough time for people to view the Relic. The Relic (the Holy Right Hand of St. Stephen) is located in the chapel just to the back of the main altar.If you visit the Basilica, do so when there are orchestra scheduled.

You can literally see the whole city including parliament, chain bridge, buda castle and the danube river.The viewing gallery shuts at 16:30 so make sure you get there before then otherwise you'll be disappointed as they are very prompt!The climb is mighty but worth it and there is a lift which you can use to take you about three quarters of the way up."

The music was great and the space is wonderful at night when there are far fewer people and the whole cathedral is lit up in its grandeur. Cheap concert too, around 25 euro for 2 people, excellent performance! And what a unique venue!"

St Stephens Basilica is named in honour of Stephen I(975-1038) ,Hungary's first King whose mummified right hand is housed in the church reliquary.It is the third largest church building in Hungary and the tallest building in Budapest along with the Parliament building having a total height of 96 meters (315 ft).Its architectural style is Neo-Classical and its facade has two large bell towers with the southern bell tower housing Hungary's largest bell weighing 9 tons.The Basilica is also famous for its musical concerts with the head organist of the church always considered one of the best musicians.The Basilica choir often performs in different parts of Europe and during the summer months perform every Sunday at the Basilica premises.Attended the 0830 mass with the mass rituals similar to masses held in my native India only slight differences being language and a few different religious rituals during the mass..At the end of my Central Europe tour have to say that all Churches i visited in Vienna,Bratislava,Prague,Kracow,Wadowice and now in Budapest resembled Palaces in religious art decor and murals."

I found Notre Dame Cathedral to be utterly underwhelming compared to St. Stephen's Basilica. The Basilica is HUGE and is architecturally interesting and very pleasing to the eye. I saw the Basilica during the day and also at night - it was worth spending the time there - if you have to choose one time to go, I would go at sunset or at night. I also attended an organ concert here (every Thursday night, I believe). While the performers were not amazing (very good but I was not sitting on the edge of my seat), I still thought it was worth the inexpensive ticket to attend. The area around the Basilica is very nice and safe to walk at even during late hours."

His name is all over the country and supposedly a relic, as in part of his hand, is located here as well. It\u2019s a nice church and after seeing so many churches the past week, I was becoming numb to its beauty. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved it, but if you have been following me through the trip, beautiful churches are a plenty in Europe.One thing that this church had that others did not was the relic of St. Stephen, so that was worth checking out.Today was a national holiday, so most of the stores were closed. Touristy places, such as this Basilica, was open, and the public took advantage of it. We shuffled into the church, and there was a sign suggested the donation is \u20ac1,00. People dropped coins in the bucket as they entered. I didn\u2019t quite have \u20ac2,00 so I tossed in one plus whatever coins I had left from the trip. As my Stephen said: we donated our toilet money to the church.      The Chapel in the back had his relic and it was enclosed in a case.In the back of the church was a door way leading to a small chapel. The chapel had a few pews and along the wall were stained glass windows featuring Saints that were important to Budapest, such as Margaret, who has a bridge named after her.Just past the altar is a case, and inside was the supposed relic of St. Stephen. Every few minutes the case would light up, and you can see the hand. Pictures were allowed, as long as there was no flash. If they caught you using flash, there would be a penalty charged."

It is beautiful which I tend to expect from the grand churches of Europe. And as someone who prefers visiting a church which has a tourist inclination (i.e. they ask for fees), the two hundred forint recommended donation provides a welcome into the main church.Beyond this, there are a few more payment options. You can see St. Stephen's hand, which I did not do. You can also take one of the elevators, near the ticket booth, to the treasury. Something that I don't think is particularly worth it, as it shows a small set of the standard monstrances, candle holders, sceptres and robes that you see in so many other locations. Although it does give a bit of history and was a place where it seemed like I escaped the crowd.The elevator, on the opposite site of the entrance, will take you to the floor where you can start climbing to the panorama. Not a bad climb, with landings where it is fairly simple to pass someone and normally good head room. Nice 360 view when you reach the top, but made somewhat less memorable by the other options in Budapest where you can get, what I think are, better views."

In a case where you need to insert a coin for a light to go on in order to see the hand. It is his right hand to show the power he had in Budapest. It is kind of creepy..."

If you want a great view of the city (different vantage point than from Buda Hill) going up to the Tower is worth it (around 100 HUF). The Treasury is very small but well done. I would only suggest paying for this (also around 100 HUF) if you are interested in the significance of the Basilica's well-known priest."

I visited this basilica last week on a rainy cold day, I must say I had seen the cupola several times from afar, I had hired a guide to take me around Budapest on Sunday and her description of the basilica and the efforts to build it, and the meaning behind it, made me add it to the list of places I wanted to see. It sits on its own square and it so big and so disproportionately tall among the surrounded buildings that it makes you stop in awe and approach it, touch it, feel small for a moment next to it and imagine the thousands, millions of souls that have gone through its walls. Aside from having fantastical proportions, it is beautifully symmetrical and although tall as a skyscraper, it sits serene, self-assured, as a testimony of what human beings will do for their faith. It has intricately decorated ironwork fences, exquisite wood and stone carvings and breathtaking ceilings...and all of this is on the outside. When you enter, the mix of marble colors, gold leaf, polished shiny brass, gold relics and harmonious lead stained glass giant window panels reminds of St. Peter's at the Vatican. This building is much much smaller, but the carefully designed columns and the proportion of height vs width at the side naves provokes exactly what it was meant to provoke when built: awe, you're in the presence of the Divine, sacred soil, this is intended to make you feel small, powerless and well...poor. Sarcasm aside and being catholic myself, these days I go to church when feeling compelled, when traveling, I don't visit every church there is and don't feel guilty if I didn't make it, I don't believe in a God that I see inside a building, I see HimHer everywhere. Nevertheless I think this is the first review I post on a church and to me, this one is worth visiting. The cavernous inside with its side cupolas flanking the central dome is exquisitely preserved and it smells clean inside, it was also warmer than the outside, I think it's a great rainy or cold day activity, or a way to close a day of walking n shopping. The piazza radiates walking promenades from it, with nice restaurants and some shops, it is primarily a touristy area, clean, well preserved and cared for, and you see an international crowd walking or lunching. It all feels very European and quaint. I went in by myself, I didn't do a guided tour, but I saw a big one being given in Spanish, and it wasn't \"esta es la c\u00fapula central, este es San Esteban...gracias por venir...\" It was detailed and technical, the guide was mixing her knowledge of the architectural details while explaining who St Stephen is. As a feat of daring engineering, considering the difficulties to transport marble chunks and work them into solid columns, and nothing this tall existed thereabouts, it is a testament that when there's a will there's a way. Just like visiting mosques, temples and pagodas in Asia when I travel there, I go into evoking buildings like this to see, to feel, to smell and to learn."

Built between 1851 and 1905 in baroque style, and restored after it was badly damaged in the Second World War, the best way to approach the Basilica is to come up from the chain bridge to the open square, Szent Istvan Ter, from which its facade rises up to the heavens. The main doors have carvings of the heads of the 12 apostles and there are fine painting incorporated in the architecture of the magnificent and richly decorated interior. There is a small exhibition giving information on the history of its construction. The Basilica's main treasure is the mummified forearm of St Stephen, only brought here in 1945 and held in a beautiful miniature representation of a gothic church.This is one of the \"must-sees\" in Budapest. It also holds organ concerts and the square outside is very much part of the life of Budapest, being used for events and musical performances."

The long reverberation time meant that individual notes tended to be subsumed in a mush, and the bass, because of the sound characteristics, seemed to be playing almost at a different tempo. The seating was uncomfortable, long cushions each covering several (creaky) stand chairs. So visit the building, just don't buy the tickets.If you have a head for heights, you can go to the lantern for spectacular views."

It's not lit up, and two minutes of lighting will set you back 200forint (50 pence). I put my coin in and a vast crowd of people - around 25 - rushed over to see it illuminated. Quite why they were all skimping on the coinage is beyond me.Anyway, entrance is 200 forint - so you can see why the light is a little on the pricey side. Further you can climb or get the elevator up to the dome rooftop for a further 500forint. The entrance to the tour is hidden, and I am sure many people miss it and don't bother to climb. That's a shame as is well worth it, and offers brilliant views over the city.Be warned - if you're climbing it is 299 steps so hard work. You do have the option of doing half and getting the lift for the other. I say it's 299 steps, a sign said it was 302. I counted and got to 299.

We visited this church in Sept 2015, the square in front of it offer fantastic views of the church, and the church itself (especially on a night time) look beautiful in its current location. You do have to pay to go up the stairs (and there are plenty of them!) to get to the lookout tower right at the top of the church, but once up there it offers outstanding views across all of Pest and out towards the Buda side also. Selfie's are a must!If you do struggle with walking there is a lift/elevator that takes you so far up, with a secondary one available.Definitely recommended if you visit Budapest."

I didn't like the fact that you had to make a 'donation' it felt as if you were forced to pay money and that should not be the case when entering a church. Its not the actual cost of going in but the principle behind it. If people want to enter the church they should not be forced into paying. It should be entirely up to the individual to make a donation. That said when you do pay to do the panoramic platform the view is fantastic over all of Budapest!"

If you have a guide, the story of the church will make this even better. There is a box at the entrance with a suggested entrance fee. If you don't have it, it's still alright to enter.

We were a bit late for the mass and we were not allowed to enter a railed (enclosed) area nearer to the main altar. Many of the mass attendees were old people and there was only one mass schedule per weekday. One will see that it is a very beautiful church if you get to come when most of the lights are on. There was a short line to the right hand relic of St Stephen maybe because it was a weekday. We did had all the time to read and pray before the relic. The area going to the relic and within the relic itself are quite dark. There was no one to guide us nor to give assistance. There are other tourist spots like the Opera within the area of the Basilica. We stayed in a hotel nearby and we just walked to these places. "

If you're there on Sunday, chances are you'll see some weddings (i can't imagine getting married in a place so grand, but i guess \"go big or go home\" works, too.) I also went back at night to hear a string/vocal concert--ethereal doesn't begin to cover it. The concerts are not very long, a little over an hour. The repertoire is mostly crowd favorites, which is fine. It's pretty moving to hear Ave Maria against such a beautiful backdrop. Even if you're not religious, you still might have an moment of feeling in the presence of the divine/beautiful/something transcendent. And while the ticket may seem expensive (i paid 6500), a similar experience would easily cost 5-7 times that at home. Go go go!!"

This is probably the best viewing point to look at both, Gellert hill with citadelle and the Royal Palace hill. Also the further distant Parliament can well be seen from here. A perfect view point for the entire city!PS: Elevators are available - but walking is more fun :)"

It took the builders 50 years to construct it and 2 of it's architects died during that time. It took a great effort to build it's 96 m dome high dome. The interesting fact about this dome is that the parliament building's dome is exactly the same height too, which shows Hungary's balance between the state and religion. No building in Budapest is allowed to be built higher than this. Inside this church we can see beautiful artworks, mosaics and stained glass windows. It also has the most sacred relic of Budapest, the right hand of St. Stephen. The church has two bell towers and the largest bell of Hungary. It is called the Szent Istevan Bell, and it weighs nearly 10 tons. Do not miss going up to the observation deck of the dome to see the same beautiful view of Budapest. You have to pay a donation of 200 HUF to enter the church and a small fee to to visit the observation deck."

The Basilica is beautiful, and provides choral music, classical music, as well as contemporary musical performances -- these concerts include arias sung by Kolos Kov\u00e1ts, famous concert and oratorio singer; and organ recitals by Mikl\u00f3s Teleki, also the country's finest. A flutist and violinist also performed solos during the evening I attended. The acoustics in the Basilica are amazing. Cost of tickets are minimal at the window inside the front door -- just stop in mid-day to check performance times and purchase your tickets."

Just beware once you get out of the first lift you have to leave you buggy. Then take the right hand side door in the galley as this is another lift. The left door is stairs and it's quite a few as we found out."

The echo of the chant and father's voice set the mood for a worshipful place. Candles lit everywhere to pray for loved ones. The service was a baby baptism...precious. This church was most impressive in decor and it is quite prominent outside as well. I really liked that it has a courtyard outside ( unlike other Europen churches where people unfortunately propped buildings up around them). People sit on the steps outside or mill around in the courtyard. Makes one want to sing w Mary Poppins \"Feed the birds\". it was too hot of a day to climb the 364 steps to the top but I wish we had done so."

Eat dinner at one of the nice restaurants on Zrinyi before hand it it will be a recipe for a great night.

The St. Stephen's Basilica is the largest Roman Catholic church in Budapest. It took more than 50 years to construct . Entrance is free, however a token donation of HUF 200 was requested. We also went to the treasury, which was open to public. There was a well preserved cut- off hand in a glass box of the ancient king.

We had a pleasant evening; although I would say that they whipped through the play list, so the concert lasted just under an hour. The quality and the acoustics, however, were good. The soprano sang for 3 of the 11 pieces.The church itself is stunning and it was lovely to be in there in the evening on what was a very hot day.Value for money wise, it could have been better. I thought it was quite expensive and poor husband was sold it as an opera, not a string concert of 7 people. Though they were obviously incredibly talented. I wouldn't visit again, I'd prefer to go to the State Opera if possible."

The most important Church, and the third highest, building in Hungary dominating the skyline and with an absolutely stunning interior which, literally, takes one's breath away.Regular organ concerts are held in the Basilica and we attended one of the regular Monday concerts - pay by cash on entry - and the experience of sitting in the Basilica and being exposed to the full range of music from the great pipe organ is an experience not to be missed, even if you are not a classical music fan."

I wouldn't normally be into religious site but the buildings architecture is amazing and the artwork inside the main area is stunning. Found the room containing the holy relic to be a bit daunting as it is a small, quiet room with pews for praying and not much else. Overall, I'd recommend seeing the building if you get the chance."

Unless you're a big church fan and it's meaningful for you, skip this one. The views are okay, but I thought that the views from the Castle Hill district were far superior (and free!).

As with most other significant churches in cities around the world, it sits in a plaza with plenty of coffee shops around the edge, including the novel Gelato Rosa (see separate review) Unlike many other churches, there is no entrance fee.It is the largest Catholic church in Hungary and the beautifully ornate interior reflects it's importance. Take the time to look up into the dome. The Holy Dexter, the preserved, severed right hand of St Stephen is kept in one of the side chapels. If you have the correct combination of coins you can pay for it to be illuminated for a few minutes, otherwise it's difficult to see much.It was busy when we visited, but there was a calm atmosphere throughout and plenty of space to take a seat and reflect for a while.For a small fee you can take the lift to the top of the dome and stroll around the outside balcony for a view over the city. You really shouldn't miss it!"

You cannot go to Budapest and not see the Basilica.The interior is very picturesque: there is a huge amount of marble used in the floor and columns, and religious paintings are dotted throughout the church, surrounded by gilded frames. There were some particularly colorful stained glass windows, and the altar looked very magnificent. The pews were also tastefully carved. In a small room on the left side of the church, you will find the Holy Hand of St Stephen, which is actually less impressive than it sounds. You have to put a coin in a machine for a light to illuminate it for a short period of time, and all it turns out to be is a blackened dry fist. It may be gruesomely fascinating for some. Climbing up the stairs all the way to the top of the Dome was definitely a highlight, with great views over central Budapest and the River Danube. There was an entrance fee to access the stairs to the top of the dome, but it was not too expensive. The exterior facade can make some great photos if you can get a shot without too many people on the plaza. It's still nice to just stand in the middle of the square and look at the entrance of the building. A must see."

The relic is displayed in a glass box and one can barely see any detail, even if you insert the coin that lights it up - we had a better view from the pictures displayed at the entrance of the room.One can pay a small fee to go up the tower and enjoy an amazing view of Budapest - totally worth it!"

This church is huge & looks stunning on the outside; the interior didn't impress me that much, though I can't but admit that the decoration is very rich. However, the main thing to do here is climbing to the top of the dome. For a small fee you can either get there by an elevator (though you'll need to walk some steps up anyway) or climb all the way up the spiral staircases. There's a small exhibition midways showing different basilicas from around Europe (including St. Istvan's) compared to each other. And finally you reach the outer rim of the dome, from where there's a clear view to all sides, with all of Pest down below, with all of Buda & a bit of Danube in the distance, with all the landmarks like the Parliament, the Fisherman Bastion etc. clearly visible. Definitely worth it!"

I'm not religious in the slightest and have absolutely no interest in religious history, but I love and appreciate beauty, ingenuity and vision on all levels. Just walking around St Stephen's I found a real respect and wow factor for the plush and very grand and heavily decorated interior, it simply is a stunning basilica and one of the nicest I've ever seen. For just a few pounds you can take the many steps to the panoramic views at the top of the dome, which I thoroughly recommend as the views and quiet are quite something. I'd definitely go back here again. Oh.....and go to eat at 'Olivia Etterem' restaurant just across the road....... the best meal I had all week in Budapest and one of the cheapest."

Laid out before one are all the iconic buildings that the 'Pest' half of Budapest is renowned for. Great way of getting a sense of Budapest. Being a Sunday I suspect we were lucky that we arrived early afternoon when Sunday masses were over. Reading an earlier review I suspect that was why another traveller did not get access on a Sunday morning. The fee is 500 Ft p/p. There are 2 lifts. The main one that goes to thr 3rd floor, followed by a reasonably steep climb to the top. Or you can then catch another lift which takes you almost to the top. The interior of the Basilica is vast & ornate. Be sure you visit the little chapel (almost missed it) with the mummified remains of King (cannonised to saint) Stephen's right hand. An important aspect of the Basilica. A must see. The other must is The State Opera House. Guided tours on the hour in various languages. 2900 Ft per person + you are supposed to buy a ticket for taking photos. Worth every florent. The Opera House guide we had was great value."

Looking up at the church, you can see where the viewing area is and it doesn't seem like you'd get that great of views...but trust me, it's worth it!We headed inside which costs 200 HUF per person (there's a change store within eyesight if you haven't changed money over yet). I am by no means religious but the interior almost made me shed a tear. Truly stunning! Finally, we headed up! It was 1000 HUF for 2 adults and 1 three-year-old. It was a lot of steps and quite a workout! When you think you're at the top...you're not. There's a little gallery about halfway up where you can take a little break. Then head up some more narrow steps to finally get to the top. You're out on a little platform that goes all the way around the dome so you can see everything in every direction. Amazing views! When you've taken pictures in every direction and given you're legs a break, you can climb back down...which may be harder than climbing up. There is an elevator...but my 3-year-old climb up and down every step so you can too."

Stephen I, the first king of Hungary, was responsible for the conversion (occasionally under coercion) of his people to Christianity. He was canonised early in the 19th-century, and approximately a hundred years later, Budapest's Catholic basilica was consecrated and named after him. Despite being somewhat boxed in by surrounding buildings, it's difficult not to be impressed by its impressive size. And together with a neo-classical design, the basilica is a prominent landmark in the Palace district of Budapest. Facing the east facade of the basilica from St Stephen's Square, its central dome is flanked by two distinctive bell towers. Above the main entrance, the Latin inscription reminds believers that Jesus is \"the way, the truth and the light\". Visitors enter the basilica via a side door but take a look at the main door as it bears the images of eleven loyal apostles and St Paul.However, it's really the interior of the basilica that takes one's breath away. The cupola is not as large as the one at St Peter's Basilica in Rome, or as stunning as the Cathedral of Santa Maria de Fiore in Florence but it is nevertheless beautifully stunning. Within the rest of the basilica, many of the arches and walls are elaborately decorated and gilded, so everything looks especially lovely on a sunny day when the basilica receives plenty of natural light. Look out for the pipe organ perched above the pews. Finally, if there is time, climb the narrow circular staircase to see the dome. While not particularly spectacular, you'll notice that it's really two domes, one atop the other. Stepping onto a narrow walkway that surrounds the dome, there are terrific views of Buda's skyline as well as across the Danube River to Buda Castle."

The church is impressive but, when we were there, so full of tour groups that it was hard to get a real sense of its religious significance. We paid the (very cheap) 500 forints to go up in the lift to go up the dome and get a breathtaking (literally as it was so windy) view of Budapest. If you are only in Budapest for a few days, as we were, it is worth visiting."

After two weeks of castles and cathedrals, it would have been easy to write this off as \"another old building.\" My advice is don't! There is a nominal admission charge, but the beauty of the cathedral is well worth it. The construction is of course awe-inspiring, but take some time to look at the murals, artwork and architecture.There is also a relic of the Catholic church in Hungary in the cathedral-the right hand of St. Stephen. St. Stephen is credited with accepting Christianity on behalf of the Hungarian empire, so this may be a big deal to you if you are interested in church history. Personally I wasn't moved by seeing it, but I'm also not Catholic."

I defy you to walk into this place and casually wander about (as most of us tourists do) and then coherently describe what you just saw after you leave it. Go ahead, try it.Although relatively recent in the architectural church history of Europe it is still impressive in its ability to overawe to the point of befuddlement.

You can either take a lift or the stairs - we opted for the lift, as we had to make our way to the Opera afterwards. Going up inside the inners of great cathedral, you could see how iron and steel were used to support the structure.

We think maybe a wedding as we saw a young woman in a white bridal gown outside taking pictures. We decided to pay the fee to go up to the observation deck for the panoramic view of the city. There are quite a number of steps or 2 separate lifts if you can't do the steps. Once you get to the top and go out to the deck it goes completely around the top of the tower. The view of the city is wonderful. I recommend doing this if you decide to visit the Basilica. The church itself is very pretty inside but personally I liked the Matthias Church better."

I visited on a day when my friend was unwell and after taking in the dark beauty of it's interior I decided to pay the 500forint to climb to the top of the dome and have a look see at Budapest from above which I am so glad I did. Not only did I find the charge to do this extremely reasonable in comparison to most other cities for a similar experience, the views are breath taking. There are two lifts that can take you up there or you can be a dare devil and climb the 302 steps to the top like I did. Being terrified of falling from heights this was a huge thing for me, some of the stairs are quite steep and relatively unguarded. I managed to get up there but took the lift back down. It was definitely worth it however."

In a chapel at the rear of the church is the almost 1000 year-old mummified hand of Saint Stephen the first King of Hungary. It is kept in a glass case."

Don't miss the relic (the right hand of king Stephen/ Istv\u00e1n) in one of the chapels (easy to miss). Take the elevator up to the outside terrace to see the city laying at your feet - truly wonderful! If you want to walk up the last bit, you can skip the second elevator and use the stairs instead. You are rewarded with a glimpse of the big cupola from the outside, the \"backside\" of it in plain English! Make this trip to the terrace both in the morning and the afternoon and you will see Budapest 360 in the best light!"

There are two ways up...stairs and elevator. ...however, just because there is an elevator doesn't mean that you will not have a few steps to climb... If you choose to take the elevator, you will actually go up part of the way in one elevator, walk thorough a small gallery, walk up about 8 steep stairs, get on a smaller elevator (4 people max) and then go up about 16 to 20 more steps to get to the top. It isn't too bad, but if you have mobility issues, be aware that there are stairs to navigate. Unfortunately, it is not wheel chair accessible."

All they missed out is what in Britain would be called Victorian Gothic! So, it is big and it holds the hand of St Stephen after its peregrinations over many centuries around Eastern Europe and which landed it in Hungary. If you pop a few coins in the slot, the hand is illuminated. I think some folk stand around the reliquary that contains the hand in the hope someone else will drop some coins in.The rest of the basilica is big and rather ordinary as cathedral-like buildings go. Still they only suggest a donation for entry. I believe that the organ concerts that are held regularly are worth attending to hear the great organ but we missed out on those. Perhaps that would be the way to experience this otherwise ordinary if very big church building"

There is an exhibition at the back left side of the church where you can go and see the mummified hand of St Stephen. We went through out of curiosity. It is in a box which is dark and you are then asked to pay some money to get a light to show the hand. It just felt that everything was being up sold. We then paid to go up to the top. To do this there is an initial stone circular staircase and then you get to a room where you can either get an elevator or go up these metal stairs. We went up the stairs. I must say I never thought I was bad at heights but these stairs were awful. You can see right through to the ground and they seem to twist and turn forever. It's safe to say I had to get the elevator down.The views at the top are lovely. The observation area isn't very wide so be prepared to rub past people once up there depending on how busy it is."

There is a small fee to enter the viewing area (Ft 500, for adults). You do have to walk up several hundred steps, so, be aware that there is a long and steep walk ahead of you. There is an elevate available, but many people in line for it, therefore, you may have a long wait. Ultimately, I have to say, the view is not worth the effort. Most of the view is obstructed by the surrounding buildings, and you can hardly see anything of interest. Indeed, even the Danube is not visible. If you want a really great view of Budapest, take the funicular up to castle Hill, and get some great views from Fisherman's Bastion. You cannot beat those views, and they are much better than the view from the Basilica."

It also has an interesting Black Madonna Icon from this century. Otherwise it is full of 19th Century gilt. Entrance fee is 200 HUF via a very grumpy concierge.As there are so few other good churches in Budapest due to wars & invasions plus Communist rule, it is worth a visit, if you like C19th neo-classical buildings.I believe the organ is first rate, but we were unable to go to a concert in the time we had availble"

The people around were apparently not smart enough to figure out how to threw a coin in the machine next to it to make it light up, so after a while of observing them being confused i did it. Unfortunately these respectless and apparently extremely dumb (European and Asian) tourists then suddenly felt entitled to photograph with full flash on although it says on the signs everywhere in big fat letters and with images that flash is not allowed.

Most cathedrals look like they are trying to squeeze the sides together and have everything pointing upwards. Here the facade is a rectangle, with the 2 spires (clock towers) on the ends. Built with a lovely white stone; but where are the 2 missing statues from their niches?Have a look at the back of the building. Fantastic. This looks beautifully planed and executed. Most others look totally unplanned and are a mess, and hope that no one will venture here.The interior is gold, red, orange - and the floor orange and white -- and there is not a square inch uncolored. Up front there are pews, then rows of (dare I say it) cheap looking single chairs - that look like they would struggle to hold me. And nothing to kneel on!I liked the lanterns on the 2 spires and the dome. But could not understand the pastel pink, blue and purple on the interior of the dome.Brian, from Perth. W. Australia."

It is a Catholic Church that has daily Mass and various other religious ceremonies. It was a voluntary donation at the entrance to the inner Basilica and a mandatory donation to climb up to the dome (about 2 euro). The inside is spectacular with highly ornate stained glass and a very decorative organ. I was fortunate enough to witness the singing of local children in preparation for their First Holy Communion. It truly continued the wonderful tradition of music in Hungary and was just magical. After climbing to the top of the dome, the view over Budapest was great, but there was quite a haze the day I was there. It was the inside of the Basilica that really did it for me. Wonderful."

It is free, a small donation was asked for, but you do not have to give a donation for admittance. Inside is a lot of gold leaf and sculptures of different saints that are important to Hungarian culture. I found it quite interesting that instead of having Jesus on the cross at the front of the church ( like most Christian churches do ) that st. Stephen is in the front of the church instead. Make sure to do your research before coming about st.stephen. very interesting individual.... and when you go make sure to look for his right fist that is encased in a glass box in the back left hand side of the church. I know it sounds strange...but like I said, do your homework. Very interesting historical facts behind this amazing basilica!!!!"

I had real high hopes for St Stephen's Basilica and it was at the top of list when prioritising places to visit during our four day Budapest stay. The building from the outside is stunning, and there's plenty of room on the square to get a great shot if you're into your photography (also a great view from the wine bar, Di Vino, opposite, if you're more into wine!). However, as soon as we climbed the steps to enter the Basilica we were met with the ominous stares of two cloaked priests. They didn't seem to want to inform us of anything, and we didn't really feel the need to buy a programme, so we proceeded to the entrance. When we got to the entrance door, there was a donation box, with a sign suggesting a donation of 1euro. We had expected this, and will often make a modest donation of what we can when visiting any church or other place of worship. It was then that we noticed we had been followed into the entrance hall by one of the aforementioned cloaked priests. Without a word, he pointed aggressively to the donations box. We had planned to make a donation on our way out, which we had always found to be quite acceptable to many of the other churches we have visited before. But this guy wasn't taking no for an answer. As I pulled out my purse and emptied my coins into my hands to count out my donation, the guy shouted 'coins, coins, coins', which I took for him meaning I should donate more. This made us angry and feel that this was all they had been interested in. This suspicion was then confirmed when we approached the mummified forearm of St Stephen in a small chapel at the back of the church. I struggled to see the actual specimen, until another cloaked figure appeared and pointed out the machine which you needed to pay money into before the forearm would be lit up! I found this absolutely unbelievable and would never wish to visit this church again.Any church should be open to the public for a donation of their choice - it made me wonder whether they would really have turned us away if we hadn't had any money with us! Disgusting.They should really be aware of how wrong what they do is in this regard - we would most certainly have made more than the suggested donation had we not felt forced into doing so. As a result of this, we didn't then choose to pay to go up the tower either - they would be better off trusting people to donate what they can."

The outside is also just gorgeous. Wonderful presentation of architecture. 3. My son was hoping to see the bells and when we asked the lady who managed the ticket booth to go upstairs If we would be able to see them she said yes. You can't. It's a crazy long walk up the stairs and you can see just about everything else you could see from the top of any other building. Don't bother with going upstairs. Go up to buda castle for a view instead."

The organ and the main altar are making a great balanced opposition on the main part of the building, the Saint's Right Chapel is beautifully hidden behind the main altar, the small side-altars add a little plus to the feeling, and the panorama on the balcony around the main dome is breathtaking. You can see the whole of Pest, and the best of Buda, from there. The treasury was somewhat a disappointment, quite a small exhibition, but then again, it may have just been my own expectation."

We visited the Basilica during one of the free walking tours (1.5hr) so our time there was a bit rushed, but from what we saw, it was a beautiful place.Being a Catholic church you are expected to make a donation as you enter so we threw a couple of coins into the collection pot. From inside you can see where all the money goes as it's a stunning place, however I personally felt a bit sickened about how much money must've been spent on it. I'm not a religious man, but even I imagined Jesus berating the religious leaders for such waste.Within the back of the church you can also see the hand (allegedly) of St Stephen, the first king of Hungary. If you put another coin in, you can also light up the case! Wonders will never cease."

The whole tour is inexpensive, only 3 euros per person to visit treasury and to \"climb\" on the top of the Basilica and catch a beautiful view.The view is perfect and you can see the whole Pest. You can choose weather you want to go by foot or by elevator.We also visite treasury which is too small. If you read every single thing, you can't spend more than 20 minutes inside. There is a room of about 20 square meters with treasure, but that's it. I visited Vienna last year and in comparison to that experience it is less inspirational.Still highly recommend to visit this church! :)"

It stands out in the city with its tall spire and is the focus of anywhere you can see it - the sheer size grabs the eyes. Inside the size becomes even more impressive - it makes one feel so small and insignificant.There are 2 chapels at one end of the building (you need to go through doors). One is to the Black Madonna and the other has a display that lights up if coins are inserted (a bit kitsch for a church) that you should visit. We enjoyed our visit and was free - we are left wondering why some, like this are free, and others like the Matthias church in Buda are charged. A visit is highly recommenced if in Budapest"

There is a donations box at the entrance way and this money is clearly used effectively since the building is well maintained and clean. Inside the church most areas are open for you to look around. St Stephen\u2019s hand is in a side room away from the main church area so do ensure you don\u2019t miss it. The area in front of the glass display isn\u2019t massive so it can get crowded easily but if the display isn\u2019t lit I\u2019d recommend dropping a coin into the box to activate the light; seeing it in full glory is both mesmerising and a little creepy!Outside the main entrance door to the church is another door where you can climb (or take a series of lifts) to the viewing area around the dome. There is a small charge for this collected by the lady behind the glass window, but it is totally reasonable. Being one of the two tallest buildings in Budapest (other being Parliament) you get a great view over the city and a different perspective that from the hill in Buda. If I recall correctly there is around 320 steps to the top. There are plenty of \u2018passing\u2019 areas for a quick rest if your legs begin to hurt but the climb isn\u2019t as bad as other towers I\u2019ve visited! Around halfway up there is an open area exhibiting a number of displays for other churches around the world. Unfortunately none of these displays were in English but it\u2019s a interesting chance for a breather.From what I could tell during our visit there are no bathroom facilities in the building available to use so might be worth a consideration. The area around the church has plenty of cafes and restaurants, some with nice views over the front entrance of the building, so I\u2019d highly recommend allocating at least a couple of hours to visit here; it\u2019s a wonderful example of a neo-classical building."

It was very interesting to note that it may be the only cathedral church without Jesus displayed at the the front as St Stephen has taken that place.

The lighting made it difficult to see, but they have pictures leading up to it.Speaking of lighting, the main church was dimly lit by maybe 50% of the lighting capacity of this church.

It was a steal.The interior of the basilica was overwhelming with many ornate decorations on the walls and ceiling. Marvellous paintings surround you between leaf golden painted backgrounds and architectural elements. Lavish marble pillars and wall elements confirm the majestic history of the basilica and Budapest in its heyday.

They do ask for a donation to enter which we were fine with but I know this will put people off.

This costs a donation of 200 HUF. Then once you leave this area, the stairs to the top of the dome are the next must see activity. To climb the stairs costs 500 HUF but the view from the top is worth it. (If you suffer from claustrophobia or are scared of heights this isn't the best thing for you). After climbing approx 300 steps you reach the top of the dome, and are able to walk around the outside. Here you can see the whole city and is a great place to be reminded of the beauty of Budapest."

I am not a catholic myself but that didn't stop me from admiring the architecture, the icons, the statues and the chancel. This stunning church can hold up to 8.000 worshippers! You feel tiny...! You can also go on an elevator to the top to a gorgeous view but you have to pay and there is also a mummified arm of king Stephen but you also have to pay to see it... You really can skip those. The church is an art work alone it will leave you satisfied. You have to see it!"

Its claim to fame, apart from some stunning mosaics by one Karoly Lotz, is that it houses the right hand of St Stephen. I'm not sure where the rest of him went to. This mummified hand, it seems, has been a well-travelled tourist since it first belonged to Stephen, crowned King of the Magyars in the year 1000. It somehow became separated from the rest of him when he left the throne for somewhere higher. Then, in the 13th century, it was taken to Dubrovnik to protect it from the Tartars (that warrior race who liked a sauce made of cream and capers with their fish and chips). Later, it travelled to Vienna and then to the Royal Palace in Buda. It didn't take up residence at his Basilica until 1945. It looks quite at home in its little gilded display case, which lights up when you cross the guardian's palm with a 100 Forint coin."

I am very happy to voluntary donate money for the upkeep of any church property, but the intimidation by basilica staff reached an unacceptable level on my last two trip, and I simply refused to budge despite the intimidation.

The only problem with this basilica is a guy who is standing at the main door and he is basically forcing you to make a donation. But you don't have to pay, just be assertive and ask him if you really must pay and he will laugh and let you in. I don't have problem with paying entrance fees, but forced donations for Church are a no NO!"

The climb to the top is not free but not expensive 500HUF. Personally I'm not good on heights so was pretty unnerved whilst out on the gallery. The walls are high but for a person with a fear of heights, just enough (safe) gaps to frighten me properly. If you're nervous, be sure to not be out on the gallery on the hour as the bells vibrate the structure! The views are wide but choose a time of day when the fog/mist is low. We are here in November in good weather but visibility was not superb. The ascent itself is optionally by 2 lifts. Even with a fear of climbing, the internal stairs are not too alarming when you compare them to climbing St Paul's in London!You can't really come to Budapest and not go visit this site, but I personally would not strongly encourage the climb to the gallery..."

There is a small fee of 1 euro to enter but it's well worth it. They also have the severed fist of a hungarian leader that you can check out, I preferred the domes! DO NOT MISS the Gelato Rosa that is about 30 steps from the front of the basilica near the Starbucks). Best gelato in Budapest - I had it 3 times while I was there!"

Not sure if it is a donation or a formal fee, however, the box is kept right at the entrance with a board and i saw a priest sitting by it. so we made our contributions for the upkeep as well. and it surely was worth it...The work done on the ceiling, the altar etc is very nice. Also, you can enter the section which holds the right hand of King Stephen, king from the 9th century. here, to put on the light in the glass box that holds the hand, you need to put 200 ft.We also paid a fee of 500ft to go upto the tower. You can use the elevator or walk up some 200 odd steps. We took the elevator which takes you to one level, from there is a small flight of steps to get to the next elevator, which takes you to the tower top. The view from here is fantastic. gives you a birds view of the city.As most cities, we did this after one day in the city, so we could look out and recognize many of the prominent landmarks.A must visit."

An interesting site inside the Basilica is the Holy Right Hand - the mummified right hand of St Stephen - which is encased in a very ornate case which resembles a mini cathedral. We could have easily missed this, as the hand is not immediately obvious at first sight. The Basilica is free to enter, although donations are requested, but not obligatory. In the evening, the Basilicia is beautifully flood-lit and looks wonderful. Concerts are often held there - there was an organ concert happening whilst we were in the city, but we didn't go to that as we had other plans. Would have been lovely, I'm sure."

St. Stephens is also located at the end of a broad plaza and several blocks of restaurants and shops so it makes for a full afternoon visit. One suggestion - skip the display of the Saint's preserved hand (shown in a chapel in the rear of the Cathedral). Probably would be more meaningful to us if we were Catholic but you can't see much of anything - it's a big deal to the locals though."

Opening hours are Monday to Friday 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Saturdays 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM, and Sundays 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.Daily mass is usually held at 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, and 6:00 PM every day.

There are wonderful concerts held at the basilica on a regular basis, and tickets are sold on the entrance steps throughout the week.Although entrance to the basilica is free, visiting the Treasury costs 400 HUF, and access to the dome costs 500 HUF. There is an elevator that takes you most of the way up to the dome if you don\u2019t want to climb the stairs! The dome has amazing views of Budapest on clear days. Special guided tours of the church are available in English, French, and Hungarian, and can be booked from Monday to Friday, between 10.00 AM and 3.00 PM. These tours cost about 2500 HUF, and can be arranged in advance by emailing: turizmus@basilica.hu The guided tours include admission to the dome.I visit this basilica every time I take a trip to Budapest.

I shall keep this short because it is one of those places you have to visit to appreciate the sheer scale, beauty and architecture.While only just over 100yrs old, the ornate decorations give a sense of something much older and grand. The interior is completely lined with gold, pretty much everywhere. The religious paintings on the ceiling, walls, and even doors, are colourful, well-maintained and a joy to behold.But by far my favourite part of the experience is to climb the tower of the church and view Budapest from above. The climb is narrow through timber lofts, staircases and rooms. Some 400 steps later, the view from the top is stunning. While not as tall as the hills, for example, you get a completely different inner-city perspective from the top. And the cost? If I recall correctly it was around two euros per person. Another bit of bargain brilliance in beautiful Budapest."

It is free to go in but they ask you, understandably to make a donation to the upkeep. You can climb to the top via stairs or in the lift, but I don't think it is suitable for wheelchairs or buggies. There is a charge for that, about \u00a31.50. Whilst there we realised tickets were being sold for a 5pm classical organ concert, supported by a soprano singer. You can sit anywhere and the cost was less than \u00a310. It lasted an hour and was beautiful to listen in such wonderful surroundings."

The Cathedral itself is beautiful but the more interesting experience there was to go on an organ concert, I found out about it just from flyers handed out in the entrance. it was amazing to hear the huge organ there live with the incredible acoustic and surrounding, it also included an opera singer in some of the pieces played, it was a 45 minute concert with famous organ pieces (including the Tocata of Bach) for a ridiculous price (about 10 euro). In conclusion, one in a life time experience."

Monumental St. Stephen Basilica is as well groomed inside and outside as an imperial palace, but it has none of the excessive Baroque trappings of so many other European cathedrals. Everything is refined, tasteful, in proportion and a welcome relief!! We felt that the Church allowed for a quiet time of reflection anyone could reflect on the Divine without major distractions. We were there during a quiet time of day, and enjoyed over an hour in solitude. Yet as we explored the sanctuary, we couldn\u2019t locate the obligatory Pieta and the Stations of the Cross. Of course, we had a lot of territory to cover; the cathedral is huge. After more searching, we still were not successful until we saw that a mass of tourists who were blocking a passage to a small chapel that we hadn\u2019t even noticed was there. We painstakingly navigated into the room. Ah ha! we finally saw paintings of the Stations of the Cross. These depictions, artlessly framed in discolored glass, were mediocre and lifeless. But at least we had found them.Satisfied with one victory, we hoped to also locate the Pieta, perhaps in another recess that we might have overlooked. No luck. we just couldn\u2019t understand how such a major Catholic cathedral could ignore the Pieta.Nonplussed, we still wanted to see the Treasury upstairs. As we entered, we saw a large old painting of the Pieta. It was a little frayed, the figures were elongated in the El Greco-Mannerist style that we have always felt are a bit off-putting, and both Jesus and Mary both appeared stillborn; they had little humanity. But aside from our criticism of the painting, at least it was there. And we was for now vindicated in my belief that almost every Catholic Church, no matter how obscure or celebrated, automatically includes the Pieta and the Stations of the Cross.As Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof used to proclaim in defense of a Jewish rite or custom, it\u2019s TRADITION!"

Upon my visit to this impressive Basilica in Pest, I found myself continually reminded of the quotation from Pope Leo X: \u201chow profitable this lie of Christ has been for us.\u201dAs one enters, one is immediately given the choice: tower or main hall. I selected the tower first. The student admission price was modest (though the man on the desk never did ask for my student ID), and from the top of the tower one grasps some excellent views of the city. There is also a lift, for those who don\u2019t want the fun of climbing several hundred stairs.Afterwards, came the hall itself. One is asked at the entrance to keep admission free by paying a donation of 200 forint. How ironic. There are two guards making sure nobody gets in without paying something, though the full 200 is not compulsory. On the front door, women are politely reminded of their place in a religious society with several diagrams detailing what they cannot wear \u2013 no such illustrations exist for male visitors. Though, in credit to staff, the rule did not seem to be enforced as there were many female visitors wearing \u201cbanned\u201d clothing inside. I remain sceptical of \u201chis holy right hand\u201d on exhibiton. The St Stephen\u2019s hand does seem more plausible than many of the other blatant lies in European churches \u2013 such as the Jesus\u2019 blood example in Bruges (and several other locations, coincidentally) \u2013 however a little more history and science would be nice rather than a simple declaration along the lines of: \u201chey everyone, look at us, we have St Steph\u2019s hand!\u201d Though, when have the Catholic Church ever shown an interest in what actually happened? Especially when it is far more profitable to ask visitors to contribute One Euro or some forint just to turn the lights on for twenty seconds and actually let people see the damned thing.On your way out, be sure to check out the gift shop where one can purchase, among other generic Budapest and catholic souvenirs, signed pictures of Pope Francis. In truth it is very similar to most other Catholic churches and cathedrals, the only real difference is the location. Excellent views are provided: probably the only redeeming feature."

So waiting for lifts is time consuming, but the alternative is only any good if you are in training for the Iron Man, going down the stairs is easy, and saves a lot of time queuing.The views from all round the walkway at Dome height are well worth the effort of getting there, and the price of a ticket, you pay the same for a lift (500 Huf) as taking the spiral staircase."

OK for a short visit, and a good belly laugh at the \"Insert 400 Florints to Light Up St Stephens Severed Hand\" display. But as a concert venue, this is without a doubt, the worst one I have ever visited. The orchestra (which was excellent-the venue isn't their fault) was placed directly under the dome, and as a result, the acoustics were so bad that notes played a bar or two earlier were still echoing, leading to absolute aural confusion. You could not pick out any melody, even in the slowest requiem. Heaven knows how the poor soprano soloist made it through her pieces. And the wonderful concertmaster/soloist was totally wasted. It was a total cacophony. If you only have time for one classical concert, go to the Duna Palota (Danube Palace) a few blocks directly in front of St Stephens. Lovely acoustics, excellent musicians, and no late arrival tourists with cane and camera running all over the place during the concert snapping photos. If you have time for two concerts- go to the Duna Palota again. Just don't waste your money at St Stephens, sad to stay. Maybe if they experimented with repositioning the orchestra, adding some kind of acoustical fabric wings, or microphone enhancements, perhaps that would help."

The Basilica is huge, and when viewed from Buda Hill, it\u2019s apparent how much it towers over, and dominates, Pest.Entrance to the Basilica was free, although donations are welcome, but there is a small charge to climb the dome and also to visit the Treasury.The inside of the church is very ornate, with wonderful frescoes, statuary, stained glass windows and stonework, and has a wonderfully peaceful air.The altar is huge, with a statue of St Istvan, backed by scenes from his life.One of the must see sights in the Basilica is the mummified right forearm of King Istvan. This relic is displayed in a magnificent gold and silver case, styled as an ornate church, and is in a peaceful side chapel, which has beautiful stained glass windows.Given the vast size of the Basilica, it really is worth paying the modest fee to climb, or take the lift, to the top of the dome, and walk around the outside of the dome taking in some amazing views of both Pest, and across the river to Buda Hill.The Treasury contains displays of religious clothing and artefacts. To access the Treasury just use the lift opposite the ticket office / stairs to the dome."

Once you climbed the stairs to the top you will certainly have earned a cold beer when you leave.Good views of the city from the viewing balcony. Especially the very ornate tiled roof of the treasury building. Quite a strenuous walk up the spiral staircases, especially if it's a hot day. There is a lift, which nearly gets you all the way, only have a couple of short flights to get to get to the top.The interior is stunning and well worth the small donation that you pay at the church entrance. Ornate decorations and stained glass windows. Make sure you explore all areas as well as you could easily miss the black madonna and then hand of St Stephen if you only visit the main body of the basilica. And please remember to turn off your flash when taking photographs."

The whole city was at our feet, offering a 360 degrees panorama of the buildings, parks, large boulevards Budapest consists of.

I personally didn't see all of it, since I played on my iPad, but at the fronts, inside the church, you can light a candle for 200 HUF (or 1 Euro), and then on the sides you could walk down them. Apparently, on one side, there was the hand of St. Stephan there, but well, whatever aha. The whole inside of the building practially was full of gold!

I highly recommend paying an additional 500 florint ($2 or so) and take the 2 elevators up to the top of the towers for a unique perspective on the town.Of particular note is the ceiling and basilica aspects of this church, which still celebrates Mass.Lit a candle, said a prayer. Loved this church."

I am not religious but can appreciate the skill and effort that has gone into the building. I do not begrudge donating 200HUF to its upkeep, although I can understand if you just wanted to pray it might be a little offensive ... however somebody has to pay for the upkeep. So go and see for yourself, I am sure you will not be disappointed."

They have two sections: one for the prayerful pilgrims and one for the us, the great hordes of tourists (but they are nice about it). If you want to take time to sit and contemplate without being too touristy and taking photos, it's worth it to sit quietly near the front to think about things, to see the sculpture of St. Stephen.Once you are done contemplating, head back to the tourist section to take your photos, and to see the reliquiary, if you are into that sort of thing. I liked being in there as a respite from the touristing cares of the day--but soon we were back out onto the streets and sightseeing again."

Then the Church and the dominance that the church plays on the area, is quite overwhelming-spending some time viewing from a distance is also advisable. The interior is the next that is quite striking. Not over the top opulence, but enough to tell you that the Catholics had, and still have, a bit of money to throw around. Next, the view from the dome itself. It affords a panorama over the City, and gives you a good grounding of the surrounds near and far. Visit and be enthralled."

Along with Matthias Church & the Great Synagogue, these three places of worship have iconic, awe-inspiring architecture with stunning interiors & remarkable artwork.The Basilica's interior is one that strikes a serene balance between awe & reverence. The lighting is muted with brighter accenting for the paintings & alters. Be sure to walk around the church & read the fascinating [English] descriptions of King Stephen's adoration of the Mother Mary, his aggressive promotion of Christianity, & his subsequent sainthood by proclamation.I also strongly recommend that you either climb up to the outdoor rim of the dome or - for a small contribution - take a sequence of two tiny elevators almost to the top. You can then walk around the entire dome with spectacular views of Budapest in all directions. Memorable!"

Noted pieces were Ave Maria and Halleluiah. This is our first concert in a church, no comparison at all to a concert hall. The acoustics combined with the beauty of the Basilica is on experience we will always remember. Don't be tempted to purchase the more expensive tickets. We bought the lowest priced tickets. Get there when the doors open at 7:30. Sit and enjoy the place until the concert starts. Amazing!!!"

Having been to other parts of Europe, this Basilica does have a place in 'top 10' and has an abundance of natural light for some very nice pics. Not sure I believe the story of the right hand of st. Stephen...but you be the judge.The real ambience is admiring the facade as the sun goes down. Grab a cold beverage and sit on the steps and watch the people go by, the bells ring and generally relax a little. We stayed here for a month and many fond memories of evenings like this exist. Tip: if you want to eat while you view this icon, try the belvarosi lugas restaurant in the back of the church across the street. Real hungarian fare here. Mondays and Fridays you can hear concert pieces play inside on the smooth organ! It will cost but the sounds resonate through your body. Enjoy! If you have a telescopic lens on your camera, head up the tower for some views...if not, skip it...your wasting your time."

After a few days of experiencing Budapest and the less positive aspects to traveling here, we thought our visit to St Stephen's was representative of our trip to Hungary. Getting our children ready for Mass, getting to the Keleti station in time only to find out that the train was not running that day-we took the city bus which wasn't going to our destination. One of the locals we met on the train got off with us and made sure we made it to church, on time. This person walked about a mile out of his way to make sure we were on the right path, right up to the church itself. I was very unimpressed with the local \"help staff\" that couldn't care less about tourists, but this random citizen went way above and beyond to help a few tourists. This man's generosity and kindness made us realize how beautiful Budapest could be, and we carried this sentiment into the Basilica. The organized help staff was anything but helpful or organized, but the average person on the street made it wonderful. I thought this was one of the most beautiful churches I've seen in Europe, but my daughters thought the amputated hand of St Steven added extra awesome-ness."

This doesn't come without some distractions however, as it is a very popular tourist spot, and some people aren't always as considerate as others.We loved the building so much that we decided to return for one of the evening classical concerts. This again was a wonderful experience, seeing the Basilica by night, beautifully lit. The musicians weren't necessarily the best I've ever heard, but it was still an enjoyable concert in a magnificent setting.Really wish we had made the trip to the top. Maybe next time."

A Mumified, decayed, creepy dead hand. I'm sure to Catholics this is a holy sanctified item worth praying to, but if you are simply wandering through to admire the building respectfully note you're going to stumble onto a mummified hand and a big photo board on how its been restored (SKIN AND FINGERNAILS AND ALL!!!) and its really something you can't unsee!!

There were not too many tour groups when we were there and I was able to take a moment to reflect in silence without a problem.

The entrance fee is by donation, they recommend 200 Forints per person. For those who don't tour Basilicas, there is a strict dress code which is simple to follow. Everyone needs to cover their shoulders, and wear trousers or skirts to your knee or just before. There is a sign at the entrance warning people of this, yet individuals, with little respect, continued to view the inside. This makes it awkward the staff as they have to ask you to leave. The individuals who viewed whilst we were there, weren't asked to leave, but I have seen this at Basilicas in Rome. Most women used scarves, which are cheap to buy (1500 Forints at most Souvenir stores), to cover their shoulders. If you are planning to visit this Basilica or others be prepared to dress appropriately. I am not very religious, however it really irritates me when tourists don't respect the city customs they are visiting. If you don't like it, don't visit the Basilica!"

We did not go to the panorama level so cannot comment on this part but the church alone is just wonderful and there is no entrance fee for the church only (although they do ask that you donate a minimum of 1 euro for the upkeep)There are organ recitals held in the church on a regular basis - unfortunately we were not able to attend but I think it would sound amazing as the acoustics would be greatShould definitely be high on your list of places to visit in Budapest!"

When you consider all of the churches in Europe, I have not seen very many, but out of the ones I have seen this was one of the most beautiful. The architecture and artwork are highly impressive and simply gorgeous. Side note: You are expected to pay about 2 euros to get in, but it is not required. I did get to go up to the top of the viewing platform in the tower. Unlike other church towers I've done, taking the elevator up cost the same amount as walking up the stairs (500 HUF). The view from the top is amazing and I highly recommend doing it (be advised that even with taking the elevator, you do have to climb some more stairs to get to the viewing platform). St. Stephen's is definitely a must-see in Budapest."

I am a frequent visitor first and foremost for spiritual reasons, but all can appreciate this no-renaissance masterpiece. Start by walking around the building and looking up. Once inside take time examining each altar and statue, there are lots of hidden details that you miss if you rush through. It is site worth having a good guidebook or printout for. Be sure to walk slowly by the Holy Cross altar and watch as the perspective of the painting following you. At the back there is the chapel of the Holy Right Hand of St. Stephen, you have to look closely to see it and there is only proper illumination if you through in a few forints, but you don't get to see the partially preserved right fist of a thousand year old monarch everyday. Some tourists' behaviour can be a bit irritating, loud, men not taking their hats off, kids playing with the candles etc. and the cathedral staff try to maintain some peace during busy tourist times. Of course the full effect of the mosaics, statues, paintings is best when looked at calmly and meditatively. For those not afraid of heights you can go up and walk around the cupola, the view is more than worth the small charge. If you are stuck between a couple of tour groups it is best to sit down in one of the pews look up and wait for the crowd to pass. The guard at the entrance asks for donations so no fee is mandatory but they are very happy if you throw in some change. It location is perfect and missing this site is a sin."

It was a cloudy day but we still had excellent views across Pest and over the Danube and Buda. Also great as you get more of a perspective of how big Budapest is!You have to climb hundreds of steps to get up the tower, but the staircases are quite wide and have banisters. There is also a lift for the last ~100 steps or so. (Although if you are mobile, you should be able to climb the full tower without any problems.)Once you are back on the ground, don't forget to go into the church itself though! It only costs a 200 HUF donation, and the interior is stunning (and very different from the tower and exterior!).

St Stephens Basilica should not be, as one visitor to Westminster Abbey in London once proclaimed to her husband 'I'll do the inside if you do the outside'.The feast is definitely the interior ..An 1890s plethora of gilt and bronze ,mosaics and stained glass..The treasures also should be seen. The crowns and sceptres etc...At least once or twice a week there is a concert which is well worth the 20 Euros or so .The Basilica area is in the midst too of many coffee houses and restaurants....A 'not to be missed' experience ...You cannot say you have visited Budapest without the experience of the wonderful Ecclesiastical feast.."

To access the observation deck you have to pay something like 400 Ft if you are student, so don't forget to take your student id if you have one.If you have enough time you can come and listen to the organ concert in the evening.

People in robes are stationed at the doors and if you fail to deposit your \"donation\" they will stop you.The 300 steps to the tower were every bit worth it. The 5 pm organ concert was magnificent.

            "review": "St. Stephen's Basilica - A very good attraction in Budapest. St. Stephen's Basilica (Szent Istvan Bazilika) is a large Roman Catholic church topped by a 96 metre tall dome, making the church visible from all over Budapest. Located on Szt. Istvan ter, this is one of the main attractions in the city that will probably make your list of must-see attractions. Visits are technically free but they request a 200ft donation to enter the basilica. This basilica was built between 1851-1905 and required three of Hungary's top architect to complete - Jozsef Hild, Jozsef Kauser and Hungry's finest architect, Miklos Ybl. The design is of the neo-classical style based on the old Greek cross plan and the basilica was named after the first King of Hungary (975-1038) and Patron Saint Stephen (\u0160tefan Ve\u013ek\u00fd). Within the church you can find some interesting things to see, most notably the relic, Holy Hand of St. Stephen, which is kept in the right hand chapel of the basilica. It is in a room just past the exit door. You'd be forgiven for accidentally missing the side chapel where this relic is kept so just pay attention and make sure to see this side chapel. There are some lovely Art Nouveau style glass-stained windows in this room as well. These are well worth seeing as part of your church visit. There are also some nice Leo Feszler frescos of the 12 apostles near the rear colonnade and a historic Portrait of the Black Madonna in the side chapel to the right of the main altar. The altar area is attractive, featuring a statue of St. Stephen. Unfortunately, this had been removed at the time of our last visit, likely for restorations. The nave of the basilica is lined with marble walls and tiled floor, and nice glass-stained windows can be seen throughout the main body of the church. However, the dominating feature is the inner dome, which is heavily decorated by mosaics of Neo-Renaissance style, designed by Miklos Ybl in 1867 yet painted by Karoly Lotz much later on, after the first dome actually collapsed during construction due to poor workmanship. It is worth having a look at the church exterior as well when visiting St. Stephen's Basilica. The carved main entrance door contains the heads of each of the 12 apostles and the Neo-Classical facade and its two bell towers are impressive to see during the day and at night when it is illuminated by floodlights. Overall, while less ornate and decorative then many Roman style basilicas that you might have visited elsewhere in Europe, St. Stephen's Basilica is a very good church visit in our opinion and is well worth visiting. We will gladly return during future trips to Budapest."

Although being a Catholic was unfashionable (until our new Pope!) attending Mass is a part of our home routine and one we pursue in our travels. Thanks to the universal nature of the service we know when to sit, stand and kneel, even if we don't understand the language as happened in Budapest.The history and architecture of the Basilica make it a photo stop for many but for the faithful it is indeed special. The lighting and whole setting of the main altar is done with such attention to detail that it becomes almost a theatrical backdrop. We attended weekday Mass and at about 30 seconds before 6pm more feature lighting was turned on which gave a real sense of expectation and drama. While we couldn't understand a word, the service was delivered and received with great reverence. it was memorable.Here and elsewhere we observed that Hungarians are quite devout about their faith in a way we have not seen in Western World Catholics for decades. As a visitor and a Catholic it is enriching to visit a church that is not just another photo opportunity. Mass times available on their website and it currently also a venue for classical music concerts."

It is free to enter but they like you to put a donation in the box.Much is written about the severed hand of the King. You have to give the lady a donation for her to light up the display and you cannot see much."

Completed in 1905 after a build time of about 57 years. Superbly carved and decorated inside and out. The entrance fee is by a requested donation - beware, there are sometimes beggars who slip in and ask for personal donations too! The access to the tower is by a small fee and a lift if working will take you part of the way up. The rest is by steps- without the lift about three hundred in total. The view is outstanding so if the sun is out do the climb first in case it clouds over and you lose the chance to see it in the sunshine."

Inside it's a typical interior, quite dark and fairly catholic in taste. St. Stephen's mummified hand is in small glass casket in another little room behind the main church part. However you can only really see the hand if you put some money in a box and it lightens up briefly. We did not have the coins to do this and so hung around hoping that some other tourist might want to see this ancient mummified hand. Alas, most other tourists were the same as us. Peered at the glass box but did not proffer any coins to light it up! Drat! We never got to see the hand, the whole reason for going into the Basilica. On the opposite side of the main church area there is another little area where you can find a religious depiction of the black Madonna. The outside of the Basilica is quite impressive."

Take your time to stroll through the cathedral or just sit in one of the pews and ponder the role that the Catholic church played in Hungary's history. The church is not ancient, and the cathedral in Eztergom might have more historical significance, but in Budapest St. Stephen's Basilica is an important cultural attraction. The church also hosts a variety of concerts & performances during the year. While you are in the neighborhood, you can also check out the offerings of the Central European University, which has its office right down the street. Free concerts are offered there occasionally too."

I think it would be worth finding a guide for the visit, to gain more from the experience as there is not much information available in English.

And, of course, don't miss the nearly 1000-year old mummified hand of St. Stephen, the king who Christianized Hungary, which is in the chapel to the left-rear of the basilica. Bring another 200 forint coin to drop in the machine that lights it up so you can see it. Kind of hard to make out since it's inside several boxes and a bit distant, but they have a display with pictures.Wish I'd gotten some sort of brief guided tour - it's a place with a lot of history but, like many things in Budapest, the English-language explanation of it is a bit lacking. Also, it is a bit dark inside - an older person with bad vision might miss some stuff, and photos with a cheaper camera (such as my smartphone) don't turn out well."

The Chapel of the Holy Right Hand of St. Stephen has several useful information boards about the man and the relics, although you have to pay a further 200Ft to see the hand itself, which we declined to do, given the sufficient pictures nearby.

Amazing red marble and gilded accents create an ornate but tasteful house of worship. There is a side chapel (inside left) where the hand of St. Stephen is kept in a fancy crypt.

To hear the Basilica come alive with sound, be sure to attend a pipe organ/vocal concert - which is the best value for money among the musical events that were performed there. I do wish the recitalists had said something about their musical selections, though, as many listeners could have appreciated the repertoire much more."

On the Pest side, apart from Parliament Building, another impressive structure is the St. Istvan Bazilika. It is a superb building and apart from the interior which is on par with most other large or special churches, you can take the lift up to the top and walk around the outside of the dome. It is a spectacular view. I have taken a point off for the rudeness of the priest (or person asking for donations.) I actually saw someone get yelled at for not putting in money, I told him that I had just paid to go on the roof and I wasn't paying anymore than that. I'm not sure he understood, but I have been tricked before with Hungarians who can speak English!There are plenty of 3D photos of the Bazilika on 3D City Explorer, my app for iPad. If you are thinking of going and would like to see it in real 3D, get the app. It will twist your arm I'm sure.Regards, Ken.3dcityexplorer.com"

We beat a retreat to the large courtyard outside.As we gathered round her,our pilgrimage leader informed us that she wouldn't be able to use our pilgrimage flag anymore; that we should all co-operate to keep close to one another once we enter. Even then, the cautious man was still muttering under his breath when we entered the building gingerly.Once inside, we were struck by its grandeur and size. This was indeed an impressive building with stunning stained-glass windows, sky-high ceiling with beautiful pictures. There were some giant-sized marble statues near the entrance. The whole atmosphere was one of deep reverence. Maybe this accounted for the 'cautious' man's earlier behaviour.Later, we were shown the Reliquary where we venerated St. Stephen's right hand. It was shrunken and grey, but a touching sight to behold.Really worth a visit here."

A truly beautiful experience to feel the music wash over you whilst your eyes are able to absorb the powerful and dramatic images in the church.The interior has a solemn calm beauty about it, with amazing pink marble in different shades depending where you look, gold leaf decorations without being over the top, and really lovely frescos. There is this great balance and contrast between the white and light of statues, ceiling and altar, offset by the darker columns and flooring.For me, this was the best way to absorb the basicilia. I've been to a number of churches where you you just go in, go 'yeah ok very nice' maybe read a pge or 2 of a leaflet, and walk out. With a concert, you have time to think and ponder on the images you are looking upon and give yourself time to appreciate where you are.I saw reviews saying how some people didn't want to pay the nominal donation to go and visit the church, or when they paid and saw it they weren't impressed, or there wasn't enough information inside - If those reviews are causing you concern and you fee like you want to do something to get your moneys worth and more I can definitely recommend this.There are concerts on various nights - we went on a Monday which has the shortest and cheapest (even less with a Budapest card!) concert of 45 minutes. The duration was perfect for us and the music selections were easy to listen to, you don't have to be a music aficionado (we certainly aren't!). Afterwards we walked about the church to explore and take some pictures too."

The main nave is very ornate, and very tall, and the little chapel to the left contains \"St Stephen's hand\" - a famous relic which is the subject of an annual festival.A trip up the tower (extra donation) is well worth it to see the panoramic view. I went up the stairs but there are two elevators to get you to the summit. A further donation is required to get you into the Treasury, but I did not feel that this was really worth seeing."

I do not care if there is a fee to entrance in a church, I pay it and that's all. But I really dislike the practice of saying \"no fee\" and when you try to enter they charge you with a \"contribution\". I tried to enter with my husband and son and a very rude man dressed like some kind of priest told me there is a \"contribution\" (not at all voluntary, the man did not let me pass if I did not pay) of 200 HUF. When I took the coins out of my pocket to look for the amount requested, HE ACTUALLY TOOK THE MONEY OFF MY HAND and put it in the moneybox, with a rude and very fast movement, without letting me say anything. When we tried to enter, he stop me and said it was 200 HUF each, not the three of us. Very much upset, I look for 400 HUF more and I have only a 500 HUF coin. He said he could not gave me the 100 Huf return because it was not a fee, it was a \"contribution\" (that word again). Meanwhile many people passed by without paying, because he was very occupied arguing with me. I did not want to argue anymore, so I turned around and went away. The church was very beautiful, with a stunning dome, as I could see in the photos took for my husband (he could enter with the first 200 HUF), but I repeat, I do not care paying a fee entrance if there is one, it seems reasonable for me, because I suppose that a very big church as this has a very expensive maintenance. What I can not stand is this kind of lie, and much less the unkindness in the way of treating people. As a catholic, I think this kind of behaviour makes a little favour to the way people see us, especially being a money issue."

A fairly light mixed programme of music, the organ had a tendency to overwhelm all but the soprano, who had a wonderfully warm rich tone. Musical purists will not like the acoustics, (an amazing echo) but it provided a very enjoyable interlude and the basilica lit at night, is probably at its best.

Yes, it is not Notra Dame, nor is it St. Patrick's in NYC, but it is truly unique and worth visiting. Unfortunately, St. Stephen's hand is so degraded since the first time I saw it as a 9 year old girl in 1972, it doesn't hardly even look like a hand anymore (as if you can even see it in the dark room and light protected enclosure in which it is kept), but that's beside the point. Although the church itself is overall very dimly lit and dark, the amount of green, red, brown, and white marble is truly astounding. I have never seen so much marble in one place in all my life. And then, what isn't marble in this church, seems to be gold! The lighting fixtures, the statues, the ornaments, etc, etc. And the organ is absolutely fantastic too. It is HUGE! I only wish I was able to visit long enough to attend a concert. Also, try to pay attention to each nave and it's according stained glass windows...they are all designated and tied to important Saints, Kings or Religious Figures that were very important in the history of Hungary. If you take the time to explore each and every corner of this religious monument (and it is truly almost hidden), you will find a beautiful, portrait of the Virgin Mary, crying tears of gold! But the absolute best part of St. Stephen's is when you take the elevator and go up into the basillica itself and then you get a 360 degree view of the city of Budapest. It is so fantastic to see, not only a different vantage point for all the tourist attractions, but an actual look down into and out over, the neighborhoods where regular people live and work everyday. Then you will truly know...Budapest is a thriving and growing metropolis! You can't keep good Hungarian people down....."

What we knew from large churches in France was that almost all of them have some small information leaflet in a number of different languages. This however was not the case in this basilica, if we wanted to have some information we were obliged to buy a book. Not doing this meant we didn't understand most of the sights in the church, so our visit was relatively short.The main attraction in the basilica was the chapel with St. Stephan's right hand. This right hand is best seen with the lights on, but you need to pay money for these lights. This is beside the money you need to pay to light a candle and the money they want upon entering the church. Keep in mind however you are not obliged to pay an entrance fee, entry is free!The basilica itself is, beside very large, also very beautiful. This shows even when we are not able to read the signs showing what is depicted. Also we would have liked to have had a tour in and around the basilica, but we didn't see any opportunity for this."

Hungary loves statues and the basilica is proof of that with many placed in the church. I prefer to not use a flash while taking pictures in an active religious site. Not everyone feels that way and the constant flashes of light can be a distraction if your visit's purpose is prayer and contemplation rather than gawking at the splendor.There are relics in the church and if you are moved by the remains of those who have come before us then they are certainly worth a visit."

This Church is unbelievably beautiful inside. Even in late afternoon, there were crowds of people coming and going. It is a must stop for any visitor to Budapest. One nice note about this Basilica: Photos are allowed to be taken inside. That is very nice, considering the dome is fantastic from the inside, and there are many angles and much artwork to photograph."

Take a glass ( 600 HUF caution) and ask the stuff to recomment good hungarian wines, I recommend to taste St Andrea white wines, or a good risling .If oyu are done there, follow to Gozsdu udvar, Kiraly utca , great placees, not far from Basilica, 5 min walk.

The domes are magnificent. If you can, attend an organ concert which are offered frequently. During the Christmas season, there is an Advent Market on the square in front of the Basilica.

The ceiling ornamentation is beautiful and it's definitely worth a visit. "

After days of looking onto this building and watching the crowds outside it and up the tower we decided we had to check it out. When we entered there seemed a lot of confusion about where people should go and the staff weren't very helpful. The woman at the Tower ticket booth ignored my requests for tickets three times in a row. Once we got our 500 HUF tickets to go up the tower we decided to take the lift rather than the 300+ stairs. The lift staff were very pleasant. Once we got out the lift there was again confusion and lack of sign posts to direct you to the tower balcony. We eventually found the 5 or so flights of spiral stairs you have to go up to get to the tower. Probably due to the lack of signs, there was a number of visitors coming back down the very thin stair cases as we were going up which made for some awkward moments. When you arrive at the top of the tower you are greeted by stunning panoramic views of Budapest that, for the small price, are very worth it."

As we walked away from the Basilica, we found several outdoor places and picked one with a view of the font of the Basilica. Don't miss this view at night!"

Let's be fair: out of 20 tourists visiting Budapest, hardly one will devote an hour (70 minutes, to be fair - this is how long the concert lasts) to hear this funny old loud music. But the hall was 2/3 full.The organ pieces proper were sandwiched between vocal pieces - apparently for diversification of experience. In fact, there were two organs: the small one on stage - and the big one in the rear, opposite the altar wall. Of, I forgot to mention: this is a basilica, which is another word for a church, so you get two kinds of entertainment - listening to the music and seeing the interior, which is quite beautiful.Bottom line: worth a visit if you find churches and organ music attractive. Otherwise - there's a great number of bars and coffee houses right next door. Well, on the other hand, they will still be there when, after the concert, you come out for a breath of fresh air."

We arrived to the Basilica around 4:00pm, and instead of letting us know that 90% of the basilica was closed due to a concert that night, we walked in to a small room where the priest was demanding a 10 euro donation per person when the sign on top of the donation box clearly ask for 1 or 2 euro donation. I was very disappointed by the aggressive behavior of the priest, but didn't want to argue with him, so gave him a couple of dollars and went in. Then we saw that only a small section of the basilica was open and we couldn't even walk to the main alter! The outside was very nice, but definitely no comparison to the great cathedrals of Italy and France."

            "review": "Gorgeous church!. This beautiful church in Budapest is certainly worth a visit! The basilica is named after the first king of Hungary, St. Stephen, who was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church. His mummified right hand is kept in a reliquary shrine at the basilica. This saint\u2019s mummified hand is Hungary\u2019s most revered and sacred treasure. You\u2019ll find this holy relic in a separate chapel behind the main altar. This room is not easily noticed, so go to the left side of the altar, where you\u2019ll find a door that leads out of the main church and into a separate chapel. Admission to the basilica is free, but a donation box is located at the entrance door.Take your time and stroll around the vast and beautiful interior. Study the paintings. Look up at the gorgeous cupola. Inspect the statues and architecture. Appreciate the quality of the gold gilding. Gaze up at the stained glass windows. The cupola is open for tourists between April 1st and October 31st, and if you make the climb, you\u2019ll be rewarded with spectacular views of Budapest. Walk up the 364 steps or take the elevators up to the dome's observation deck. The cost to go up to the observation deck is 500 HUF or about $2.10.You can also take a guided tour of the Basilica. These are available Monday through Friday between 10 am and 3 pm, and cost 2,000 HUF or about $8.50. To get a truly wonderful experience, catch an organ concerts on Monday evenings at 5 pm year-round. Tickets can be purchased at the Basilica for 3000 HUF or about $12.75 US. Other, more expensive concerts are often held in the Basilica as well\u2026check the Basilica website for dates, times, and prices.Just as go out the front doors, stop on the landing at the little tourist booth for some souvenirs. If you don\u2019t speak Hungarian, and the lady in the booth doesn\u2019t understand English, just point to the items you want to buy!"

Although, it was a tiring ascent and the inside the staircase made you feel claustrophobic, the views from the top were absolutely extraordinary - great spot for a photograph. We went back down the staircase and decided to have a look inside the church. Before we entered, there was a \"request\" for a \"donation\", with a hawk-eyed priest positioned by the entrance, who was very keen to enforce this \"donation\". The church had some beautiful stained glass windows. The \"headline act\" of the church was the right hand of St Stephen. You have to go into the inner chapel to see it, or so we read. We were unable to see the right hand of St Stephen, but we later found out that there was a fee to get it illuminated! This small disappointment did not spoil a great visit. Would highly recommend."

Exceptionally beautiful building decorated with intrhcate sculptures e.g. the tympanum just above the entrance, detailing the Virgin Mary flanked on either side by followers, among them St Stephen.Inside you can enter the main church for a small donation. The main alter and side alters are again well decorated and the ceilings are covered with beautiful paintings.The basilica houses the Holy Right, the mummified right hand of St Stephen which is very special, a small donation of 100ft will light up the chamber and give a clearer view of the hand.You can then go up to the top of basilica to get a view of the city for 500ft also if you want to take a snap.The basilica is also the burial site of Ferenc Puskas but dont think its open to public."

I has a tremendous sense of history, being linked to the earliest kings of Hungary and it is quite humbling to take one's place in this beautifully proportioned basilica."

The silence is amazing too, to walk in from a busy city into a silent peaceful place is nice. We also paid the bank busting sum of 500f (around \u00a31.50) each to climb the tower (sarcasm is so my style!) and what a beautiful view you get. The lift was working while we were there unlike some other reviewers. It took us around an hour to do it all but you could definitely spend more time there if you wished. I recommend you spend the 220f towards the upkeep of this place so it's there the next time you wish to visit or even your children/grandchildren."

All fair, the sight is worth a lot more, but then there should be tickets... and a check, of course.Ok, so we \"donated\" the money and upon entering the building realized that (due to the upcoming concert) our movement area was limited to a small part in the corner of the church. To make it worse, after a couple of minutes we were forced out by a couple of extremely nervous priests and without any explanation. We assumed it had something to do with the concert, but then again - maybe that euro only buys that much.

When we visited it was very busy and so it seemed necessary to have somebody 'manning' the donation box so that there was some order on entering the building.

It costs a donation to go in, which is some negligible amount and is well worth more. For a small extra charge you can climb the main tower (despite hastily hand-written signs saying you do this at your own risk!). There is a lift part of the way, but I wouldnt go so far as to call it 100% accessible. Well worth it for the views though. The xmas market outside is also very nice, with a small skating rink and the usual stalls. Please watch out for pickpockets though!!!! My wife caught someone with their hand in her bag and though she scurried off empty handed, we later saw the same woman lingering among the crowds going into the church (we didn't spot any security or police in the area until later). Certainly made us more on our guard and I'd advise others to be."

St Stephens is every bit as enchanting as many more famous churches, despite its relative youth. It is breathtakingly beautiful, and worth viewing at any time.The Duna strings orchestra were a treat to listen to, guest violinist Gabora Gyula was superb. If you get the chance to see them, I recommend you attend. Low priced tickets are fine, but if you get the slightly higher priced ones, you sit directly beneath the dome."

We went inside, enjoyed the church atmosphere which is beautiful and continued to see the 'holy hand'. We got into the room only to see the hand in the display box WITHOUT the lights on, next to the display is a security lady and a sign saying for using flash we must pay. Me and my friends were laughing because we felt like it has become a business, we made photos of that sign instead of the hand and made it obvious to the security lady that we see it as a joke.

The real attraction here is the tower, which may be climbed for around 500HUF (less for students, children etc.). I would strongly suggest doing so if you can conquer the stairs, as the reward is a 360\u00b0 view of the city from its (joint) tallest building. A must-do in my opinion!"

Paid a small fee to head up to the tower... and saw the option of a lift or stairs....so we went stairs! There are over 300 and you just go round and round and round! Seriously dizzy at places, so stopped to turn the other way round, but when we got to the top, it was well worth it! The skyline is beautiful, and to have the 360 degree view of it, on top of this beautiful building, just finishes it off. The weather had cleared up by this time, so you could see right to the horizon! The castle, the parliament building, the Danube, Chain Bridge, Squares... the full lot. The typical buildings with the courtyards in the middle of them. You really got to see Budapest in another way.We then went back down the stairs (dizzy again) and went into the main building.... breathtaking. The artwork, the decor, the way it's been maintained. All so beautiful. While we were in there, some local men started singing what sounded like a hymn/prayer with amazing harmonies. They stood in the middle of the place, and it echoed throughout beautifully. Even without that.... this is definitely a place to visit! But if you're slightly older.... take the lift! ;-)"

We spent the money to go the elevator way rather than the stairs way, and that was the best way to go. The view above is spectacular and breathtaking. We also went to see St Stephen's mummified hand and if you want to see it lit up, then you had to pay for that.

We are extraordinarily lucky and honored to have tripped over this organ concert ( The last of a long run for this series) not so much because of the fine location and the fine organist and flutist, but because of the extraordinary bass Kolos Kovats who graced us with his unerring understanding of the acoustics of St Stephen's Basilica and his powerful bass voice. I only wish more of the program was dedicated to him. He presents himself very simply and even humbly on stage. You might even consider him to be the organ repairman, or similar until you see him, but more importantly hear him in the full presence of his singing ability. Then you wonder if it can be coming out of him alone. More on him later.You can and should find the tired details of the Basilica on every website known to Hungary! It was built in blah blah, and destroyed and rebuilt in blah - all dull words totally belying the amazing splendor of actually being in the Basilica. It was more amazing because of the lighting effects. Before the concert the Basilica was dimly lit. Some statues stood out but everything was basically in shadows. Five minutes before the concert started all the appropriate lighting came on and the place sparkled. It was an amazing transformation. In the day time it doesn't look quite as magnificent as it did when moving from shadow to fully lit.After viewing both Parliament and the Basilica, I had to ask myself why would anyone exhaust the coffers of a kingdom to build things of stone when their people are starving in the streets.The only thing that came to mind to our party was that people even in times of dire need, need signs and symbols to look to and to look up to that raise the spirit and their hopes. The beauty and workmanship of both the Basilica and Parliament do this admirably - although I cant help but think that some people might have enjoyed a chicken stew better - :-)I do enjoy the way many European cultures use their churches to further artistic events. The Basilica, and St Michael's both have ongoing and frequent concert series.There is no charge to see the Basilica,there may be a charge for quided tours including the right hand, and going up to the top of the tower.There are reasonable charges for the organ concerts - which are aimed at tourists ( 70 minutes no intermission ). You don't have to buy first tier seats ( 40-60 euro) unless you want to see the organist's feet fly across the pedals, and like sitting in pews.You may still be able to find the details of the concert and series ( which can be tied into a dinner cruise too if you like) at:http://www.budapest.com/things_to_do/budapest_events/concerts/oran_concert_in_st_stephens_basilica.en.htmlThis series was devised by Miklos Teleki one of the master organists of Hungary, and who played that evening. The original flutist was not available and a reasonable substitute was brought in.The acoustics of the Basilica were extremely bright and various of the pieces caused almost cacophonous reverb especially Ferenc Liszt (1811-1886): Fantasy and Fugue on the theme B-A-C-H, and Johann Sebastian Bach: Menuett, Badinerie from B minor suite wherein the flute took on spooky reverberations.The real star in my opinion was Kolos Kovats. He played his voice as much as he played the acoustics of the Basilica, rendering a superb albeit far too short performance. At one point in the Ludwig van Beethoven (1770 - 1827): The Glory of God, you could hear surreal harmonics as if angels chose to sing with him."

As mentioned in previous reviews, just buy the cheapest tickets, as you are only going for the acoustics. Once you are inside, you really can sit anywhere. It was a bit long in our opinion (about an hour?), and surrounding people seemed to be falling asleep or uncomfortable in their seats. The seats are not comfortable and are creeky and they keep the lights pretty bright during the concert. The highlight for us was when the singer or flute player played with the organ."

There were a few wheezing fatties on the way up the spiral staircase and this slowed everyone's movement due to their slow pace and width. There are lifts and there is no shame in using them if you need to.The views at the top of the tower were breath taking. Don't forget your camera! The only minor disappointment was the poor view of the mummified holy hand which is in a glass case and if you are under 6ft2 is quite difficult to see.

The cost for entry was 500 Ft per adult although there are cheaper tickets for concessions. After a long climb of the stairs (there are just over 300, but a lift is available) we reached the halfway point and were lead into a very plain looking large room which could make an excellent museum! A few more flights of steps through the magnificent dome and we reached the summit. The view was amazing and you were able to walk around the whole thing, allowing for a 360 degree view of Budapest.We also went around the church itself which was magnificent. There is no cost for entry into the church but donations are recommended. The organ and the murals were stunning. Make sure not to miss 'The Chapel of the Right Hand' which has a display box containing the right hand of St Stephen himself. Although somewhat macabre, it made for interesting viewing!"

The staff at the hostel said it, along with Parlaiment, are the two highest buildings in Budapest, but I can't confirm that. The only problem is it doesn't open until like 10am, so I didn't get to go in.

This is perhaps one of the most richly decorated cathedrals that I've seen. The walls and pillars of the temple is richly decorated with marble and ornate gilding, and the ceiling is decorated with colorful mosaics. Definitely it is beautiful! From the top of the Basilica offers a panoramic view of the city. We visited the St. Stephen's Basilica during the day but in the evening returned again to enjoy a wonderful concert of organ music. It was great! In the cathedral dimmed the lights and we enjoyed the sounds of a delightful, charming organ music. Music overflowed of the magnificent St. Stephen's Basilica, carrying our souls to heaven. Wonderful!"

There's a lot of room and the walls are high so all feels very safe. Well worth the 500huf.Inside the cathedral itself is absolutely beautiful, a lot of the reviews complain about paying to get in, but come on, it was 200huf. That's less than \u00a31.

Worth it in my view as I'm not a fan of climbing hundreds of steps and you have to pay to walk up anyway.There is another lift which takes you to the Treasury (400HUF) and if you want to enter the church you must pay an additional 500HUF.I only got the lift to the top and I wasn't disappointed. Fabulous viewing point. We were short on time the day we visited, so didn't bother with the rest :)"

Whether or not you think the church is excellent or poor (or somewhere in between) will probably be determined by your interest in cathedrals. Some travelers tire of cathedrals (seen one, seen them all), while others are fascinated. We are people of faith, and I have studied church history, so note that the reviewer here is a cathedral nerd. The interior is impressive. We didn't hunt for it, but supposedly, one can see St. Stephen's hand in one of the side chapels. There is also an observation deck but we didn't climb it because it was hot and we had already seen panoramic views from Castle Hill."

If you have been to the Cathedral in Seville, for instance -- you know how much fun the architects and designers had with ornamentation - it is mind boggling -- your eye never knows when to stop looking -- and in 5-10 minutes you feel completely overwhelmed by the interior of the Church -- it's so vast. St. Steven's is a quiet church, scaled very nicely, uses beautiful materials (marble, gold leaf, stained glass, etc) but is more restrained -- not overdone at all. It's nice to sit for a few moments in quiet contemplation. I forgot to go to the top of the steeple -- which is supposed to be a gorgeous view.In the back of the church in a very ornate container is the hand of St. Steven -- I didn't see the hand, but saw the container. I am not big about religious relics but I am glad that if his hand had to reside anywhere aside from the remains of his body that it resided in a church, in Budapest, that is named for him."

I'm glad that I paid the money to watch it. I enjoyed it very well. I wanted to watch the one in St. Michael's located in the Vaci Ute street but timing just didn't work out. St. Michael's is a lot smaller than the basilica.We bought the cheapest seats considering I thought that the venue wouldn't be big enough. Each ticket was 27 Euro or 6500 forints. My 11-year old was charged 3000 forints. I always prefer to seat at the best seats at plays, but I thought since I'm here for the music, it didn't matter as long as I can hear it clearly. So my seats turned out great. By the way, I bought the tickets right there at the basilica just a few minutes before the show. As usual, we were running late. There were plenty of seats left.I was worried that we were not adequately attired, but my husband and son's shorts with nice collared shirts were just fine. I didn't see anybody in tank tops, but casual clothes seem to be appropriate.As an added bonus, by buying tickets, we were entitled to half price tickets for the concert going to happen at St. Michael's. I probably would do it, unfortunately, we'll be heading to Krakow in the evening.So glad we did it!. (I was in Vienna a long time ago -- of all the things that I can still remember is attending a classical concert there. I think this is one of those that will remain in your memories.)"

For a nominal fee (I was having trouble finding the correct coins, and the attendant just waved my daughter and I in for a small sum) you can see a magnificent church. The church is in the heart of the city and surrounded by a lovely plaza with restaurants. My husband and two other kids decided to climb the stairs to the top and took in a great view. While not as famous as St. Peter's or Duomo in Florence, it is well worth a visit."

The area around the Basilica is a nice area to visit too.Then I went inside the basilica and although the guide books says its free, its not! You have to pay 400 florintsto enter. The priest there makes you donate 400 florints. Well, they say its free entry but then tells you to donate 400 florints or you cant enter! Inside the basilica, its very small, half of the inside is fenced off and there is literally a short hallway and an observation area where you can see the main room. Inside its dark but looks great, its like a mini St Pauls. So well worth entering because its really well decorated like a palace."

There was a big tour group ahead of us who had money on hand and they were dropping coins in the box. The man clad in black man was looking at each of them as they dropped their coins. We were standing on the side and was fishing for HUR coins as we did not have any. The man clad in black stood there kind of frowning at us. We were going to leave, but he irritatedly waived us in. I have visited many houses of prayer in all my travels, I have yet to see someone cloaked or uncloaked standing next to a donation box ensuring visitors \"donate\"! I Now, I have and I am appaled by it! I am a Catholic and this is not how it is in Catholic Churches. Thus, my fellow tourists, don't misjudge the other Catholic churches. I would gladly donate, if I'm asked to donate. But do not force me to donate and don't frown if I cannot satisfy your greed."

Not long after entering, the Great Organ began to play followed by solos from a soprano and tenor standing high above by the organ pipes. This was quite unexpected and made me wish to to return for a concert.I returned a few days later and took the lift, which takes two stages to reach the top to see the wonderful views.

The square in front is usually busy and is quite lively at night. The interior of the Basilica is ornately decorated and, with the large dome, impressive. It is well worth visiting in its own right and usually only a small donation is requested. It is also used as a concert venue and here visitors should be aware that acoustically it is not ideal (the acoustics in St Michael's Church are better) though the grandeur of the venue itself does compensate to a degree. Concert tickets can cost up to 48 Euros each (at time of writing) though we found that they were half price if you had already booked a (cheaper) concert at St Michael's. Concerts in these series tend to be well enough played, but aimed firmly at tourists and short, typically 70 minutes."

Church is all that, like most fancy churches. Want to climb the tower? That's another entrance, and another admission fee. Want to see the treasury? Yet another entrance, and another entrance fee. It is a beautiful church though and I consider it a must-do in Budapest. If you need Starbucks afterwards, it 's right out the front door."

Very ornate inside - not to everyone's taste - but I thought it was stunning. We saw the mummified hand of St Stephen and you could put a coin in a machine to see it light up - was a little reminiscent of Blackpool Pleasure Beach - I decided I could forego this excitement. Got the lift up to the top of the dome and thought the views were absolutely stunning. Having been to the Fisherman's Bastion the day before it was really lovely to see views of Budapest from the opposite side. The only reason I haven't given this 5/5 is because of the priest standing over the donations box as you went in - you WILL pay!!!"

We visited Budapest in February, which is outside the usual tourist season as it is still cold, but there are still lots of lovely things to do in Budapest, and it isn't crowded. One of the things we chose to do was go to an evening concert in the Basilica. It is a lovely venue and the acoustics are very good. There wasn't a big crowd, but this made it better. We bought 'C' tickets but found that although we were quite distant from the musicians, we could hear and see them well. The only thing we noted that it was cold, and we were glad we had wrapped up warmly. The concert lasted just long enough for the children to enjoy it without getting restless, so we all enjoyed it."

In most tour books and signs at the Bascilica it is stated that this is a free attraction however this isnt actually true. There is a required donation of 200HUF which you have to pay and they actually have someone on the door stopping you from going in if you dont donate. Now ofcourse this really isnt a lot of money to part with....its just the principle! Worth a visit though"

It is, however, free and relatively empty which is harder and harder to find. While I was not so excited about actually viewing the hand relic, it is an interesting story. The dome is particularly nice, and the light through the stained glass windows was delightful the afternoon that we were there. The inside looks extremely clean and relatively bright, not having the dark parlor sometimes found in churches due to aging."

I am an Australian from Sydney, who sang bass in the Choir of St. Mary's Cathedral here in Sydney from 1978 until December 2009. The first thing I noted about St. Stephen's Cathedral was how majestic, but not overly tacky it was. I'll talk more about this later though. I have a great dedication and love of all things tradition in Catholicism, but especially music, and I am familiar with all the great music, from Gregorian chant to the great music written in the 20th century for various liturgies, including that of Zoltan Kodaly. I was present at a Solemn Sung Sunday Mass at 10 AM (?) in January, 2010 and I was astounded at how beautiful and tasteful the choir that sang that day was. If I am not mistaken, I think it was the Kodaly Missa Brevis that the choir sang. I have sung this Mass here in Sydney myself, and it is very demanding musically. The choir did a splendid job. The organ was very beautiful also, and the organist made much of the instrument's power and majesty. To the musicians in this great cathedral, I say bravo. So many Catholic cathedrals worldwide,( especially in America, ) have opted for bad music of the lowest quality. You are showing the world how beautiful the tradition of The Church is. Thank you. The building itself was majestic, but not too \"Italianate\" in taste, which appealed to me. The sacristan, obviously takes great pride in this building and it is impeccably clean and he himself was welcoming and friendly. The clergy were interested in listening to me when I approached them, and knew all about our Cardinal Pell from Sydney! All good things though! I particularly loved the memorial to Cardinal Mindsenzty, who suffered much at the hands of the Communist regime. The hand of St. Stephen chuffed my interest in the aesthetic and spiritual value of Christian relics, but I didn't feel a need to venerate it!A very interesting and splendid monument to the Catholics of Hungary. You have much to be proud of. Being a lover a worldwide cathedrals, yours was one at the top of my list!Brent Anthony Egan Sydney, AUSTRALIA"

So there were too much people and tourists, attending the celebration. I can suggest, if you are interested in architecture and all this stuff, to visit it during a weekday.But the thing I loved the most was the square opposite the Cathedral, decorated for Christmas time. There were an amazing local X-Mas market all around, and small kiosks selling typical hungarian food. hot hungarian red chips with paprika are highly suggested!!!"

Not that the priest stays next to a money box on which is written gift to church, but you\u00b4re not allowed to go inside the basilica if you don\u00b4t insert CERTAIN amount of money, which they want. Thay should call it entrance fee not GIFT! I was very dissapointed!!!"

You can take photos with a flash, and there's plenty to snap, with statues and frescoes everywhere. Out the back is the chapel with amazing stained glass windows and the hand of St Stephen on display (you have to pay to make the casket light up), as well as flags and information. You have to visit this place while in Budapest."

            "review": "Set your expectations re: cost and schedule. A visit to St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica is on many Budapest visitors\u2019 list, and while some are satisfied with seeing the building from the outside, others, like me, want to experience it fully. From the TA forums, I learned that someone garbed in priestly clothing collects an entry \u201cdonation\u201d and that one can take a lift up to the dome of the basilica to get a great view of Budapest. With the help of Donbacsi, who translated the Hungarian website for me, I knew the Sunday Mass schedule and planned on attending one of them. However, I happened to be in the area on Saturday afternoon and I inquired at the door if there was a Vigil Mass. I was told by a man garbed in a robe (I doubt he was a priest) that there was one an hour later, so I decided to enter the church and just stay there until the service. The man then pointed to the donation box and said I needed to put in 1 euro or 240 HUF. As I did not have enough forint coins, I gave him a 500-forint note, half expecting to get change back. He smiled at me, put the note in the donation box, and waved me in (and I got my answer about the change). I can see how this can be off-putting to many tourists. The man acted more like a gatekeeper than a church member whose gentle presence was there to remind you that donations are welcome but not required. Even though I knew about the entrance donation and had read many reviews on TA regarding it, I was still a bit put off by the process. This was , after all, a church, not a theme park, and while I was a tourist, I also was going to attend services. I wondered if the entry donation was collected from everybody, including those who are come to attend Mass, or only from tourists (and those who look like tourists). I never got the answer and since I got there an hour before the scheduled Mass time, I can understand how one would assume I was just a tourist come to take photos. Once inside, I noted signage to Szent Jobb Kapolna (Chapel of the Holy Right Hand) stating that it was only open during certain periods (see attached photo) and I realized I needed to return the following day if I wanted to see St. Stephen\u2019s relic (his mummified right hand). I inquired of another similarly garbed man what time the dome was open for access, as I didn\u2019t see any signage for it. He didn\u2019t seem to speak much English, and only said it was \u201cclosed.\u201d I took that to mean that, like the chapel, it was closed for the day and given that it was already 5 p.m. and dark outside, I wasn\u2019t surprised that they would close the dome. The Vigil Mass was in Hungarian and lasted the usual hour, but given that there were very few people there (only the front pews were full), there wasn\u2019t much heat to go around, and I was feeling chilled halfway through. Because I really wanted to see the relic and go up to the dome, I returned to St. Stephen\u2019s the following morning (Sunday). I arrived halfway through the Mass and another 240 HUF was collected from me at the door. I gave him all the coins I had and he laid them out next to the donation box and counted them to make sure I had a) at least 240 HUF, and b) I wasn\u2019t trying to slip in other currencies. Again, this process showed how this was less of a \u201cdonation\u201d and more of an entrance fee. Entrance to Szent Jobb Kapolna was closed off until after the Mass ended and the congregation dispersed. To get to the chapel, one enters through a wood and glass door in what looks like a confessional box. This is to the left hallway of the main altar (if facing the altar). The door leads to a short hallway, and another wooden door. Through that door, one goes up a few steps and down another short hallway (you\u2019ll see an oversized rosary in a glass case to the left). The door at the end of the hallway is the door to the chapel. When you enter, you\u2019ll see a few pews and at the front of the room is where the relic is kept (you\u2019ll recognize the case it is housed in from the picture on the signage). There is another man garbed similarly as the main entrance gatekeeper standing by a sign that states that it will cost two 100-forint coins to light up the relic for two minutes. Otherwise, all one can sees is ornamental glass case. As I had given all my forint coins at the main entrance, and I didn\u2019t have any small bills on me, I had to forgo seeing the relic. The few other people who were also in the chapel chose to do the same thing. I left after a short while. Fortunately, there are posters inside the chapel that tells the story of the relic as well as pictures of what it looks like, so that assuaged some of my disappointment. Outside the chapel, I sought out another of those church workers to inquire about the dome. I was told again that it was closed, so I asked if it was closed for the day or if it was closed for the winter. Again, with limited English, he repeated, \u201cIs closed.\u201d So that\u2019s how my St. Stephen\u2019s Basilica experience ended. I didn\u2019t purchase a religious item from the shop outside to get it blessed at the side door (another tip from Donbacsi off the TA forum), as at that point, I just wasn\u2019t feeling up for it. I share this rather lengthy review not to discourage anyone from visiting St. Stephen\u2019s, but to provide guidance to others based on my experience. In summary:- If you are interested in getting information on the Mass schedule, there is a website, but it is only in Hungarian: www. http://bazilika.biz/. If you click on \"Napter\" (\"Day Map\" or calender) you will see the small mass is at 8:30, the \"Latin\" mass is at 10:00 and the big Hungarian mass is at 12:00. (Thanks, Donbacsi)-Costs you should be aware of:  --- Cost to enter the basilica: 250 HUF or 1 Euro coin (Bills considered as entire donation; no change given) --- Cost to enter Szent Jobb Kapolna (Chapel of the Holy Right Hand): Free --- Cost to light up the relic for two minutes so one can take photographs: two 100-forint coins --- Cost to go up to the dome: Unknown (it was unavailable while I was there), but a previous TA review (May 2011) indicated that only euros were accepted"

At risk of sounding overly poetic, this building has always functioned as a sort of mystical center to my explorations of Pest. Each time I return I have a different experience. Besides, you have a wonderful array of cafes around the area where you can have a drink or meal and take in the incredible surroundings. A great place to spend a relaxing afternoon."

He is one of the favorite Hungarian kings and it shows in this basilica. The main statue in the church behind the alter is St. Stephen and the basilica also contains his mummified right hand. Navigate to a side room in the back of the basilica to see this creepy but kind of fascinating attraction. For 200 HUF you can light up the area where the hand is resting for an even better look. We visited in December and there seemed to be almost nightly concerts at this beautiful church. There was also a small and beautiful Christmas market in the square outside."

On the inside there are baroque frescoes and a relic, the hand of St. Stephen, that looks like something from a carnival side show. We did not pay the fee to enter as we were there for Mass.

You need to pay 2 times, once to go up into the tower ( you can do so with the elevator or climbing the spiral staircase) - the fee was 500 FT per person- and the second time when you enter the church 200FT per person. My problem with the second fee is that it is called a donation, and in my opinion a donation is something that you do voluntarily. When it is mandatory like in this case they should call it entrance fee. I wonder if they charge it for the people who like to go there and pray?"

It truly is magnificent inside, beautiful ceilings and artwork all around, a very special place. We also decided to climb the stairs to the top of the Basilica, which we paid again for (very little money) we climbed all of the steps up a narrow spiral staircase, and stumbled out at the top only to have our breath taken away even more at the amazing views! You can walk round the entire dome for a 360 degree view of the city, it is so worth it, and I think we appreciated it more having climbed the stairs all the way to the top. The sculptures around the lower part of the Basilica are beautiful and make great photographs. We thoroughly enjoyed our vist, one of the best parts of our trip!"

An impressive looking building that towers over the square it is located on. It has many intricate carvings and beautiful stonework. Budapest in general is blessed with stunning buildings, with a wide variety of architectuaral styles, though gothic does seem to be the most prominent! We paid the small fee of 1500 HUF to go up to the top of the Basilica and take in the view. Firstly you have to walk up a very large flight of stairs (stone, spiral stairway, would not recommend for the faint hearted or vertigo sufferers), which brings you into a large, sparsely decorated room. Then it's a lift almost to the top, then a few more stairs. The view is incredible. You can see almost the whole of Budapest, and as you can walk all around the top there is plenty to see! It gives a lovely view on the square below, which has a little market open on it every day selling local crafts and snacks (sadly we decided not to sample the \"rooster testicle\" they had on offer!). We spent a good 30-45 minutes up there walking around, taking in the view and admiring the craftmanship of the building itself. Afterwards we went into the basilica itself, there is no fee but they do have a donation box. I'm not a religious person but I have an appreciation for history and I love religious buildings, because they are usually beautifully decorated and crafted. I was not disappointed. The inside is unbelieveable. The dome is intricrately decorated, as is the rest of it really. It is adorned with statues and gold. Every little detail from floor to ceiling is amazing, and the place is well taken care of and very clean. Highly recommend a visit!"

We didn't bother lighting up the 'hand' - a little too macabre for our liking.The concert was good, with a kind of Classic FM popular hits repertoire, about 12 'tracks', each lasting a relatively short time. The instrumentalists, trumpet and violin, and the singers were very good individually but unfortunately were totally drowned out by the organist. He was a really talented player but simply played too loudly and had no need to play constantly. Some of the performances would have been far more poignant without the organist - as my mother would say, 'there's no show without Punch!'At the end of the concert, we realised that he hadn't actually been playing the real organ, but an electric one - apparently there's only one person who's allowed to play the real one!?

Istvan) in the chapel, given that you are wiling to spend a couple of hundred forints.But the church and the tower is in itself rather interesting, although the inside of the church a bit gloomy.The views from the tower is very nice. If you are budget traveller however, equally attractive views can be seen for free from the Buda side."

It is essentially tucked away amongst banking buildings, and at first I stumbled upon it by complete accident. If you approach it from the side of the Danube, you are in for a wonderful surprise. The Bazilika stands in the middle of wonderfully renovated open square, and with its \"I am the Way, the Truth and Life\" inscription on its facade, it is truly magnificent.Its main attraction is holding the relic of St Stephen'r right hand, who is considered to be the founding father of Hungary. \"The Holy Right Hand\", as it is known, is celebrated in a day-long festivity on the 20th August.The building itself is over a 100 yeard old and was recently renovated. If I remember well, there are some stairs leading up to the gate, so I am not sure about disabled access.Like in most Catholic churches, you are expected not to disturb the service and be dressed modestly. There are a lot of posh weddings happening there, so you can come across some true Hungarian celebrities."

It's GORGEOUS, and cool to see the Holy Right Hand too (you pay like 50 cents to light up the hand to see it better, but someone had done it already so I took my pictures quickly). Free to go inside, but I would really recommend paying a couple of dollars so that you can go up to the top. You can walk up 364 stairs (we did, and didn't think there was another way - but there's an elevator right across from the booth where you buy the ticket to the top....oops) and then see a glorious 360-degree view of Budapest. Both the Basilica and the Parliament building are exactly 315 feet tall; no building in Budapest is allowed to be taller. Basically it's not an attraction that you can afford to miss (I'm not even a religious person but I still really recommend visiting the great churches in Europe)."

Unless you're getting utterly lashed in Budapest, and then maybe even if you are, you should visit this beautiful church.If you're visiting in August, watch out for short classical music evenings held in the Basilica (and in the Parish Church I think). Various soloists, often accompanied by the organist, play a number of favourite, short classical pieces. Listening to them in this majestic setting, without the hubub of the crowds, was wonderful.

I walked up to what appeared to be the church entrance. I paid a fee, which was confusing since I thought it was free. Unlike Prague, not every site is for sale in Budapest which was refreshing. I didn't see a sign in English, however, so I paid. And then teh climb began. I thought it rather odd, but I kept climbing. Then I realized that something wasn't quite right, but I couldn't exactly turn around and go back downstairs on the winding staircase with people behind me. It might be important to note that I'm afraid of heights.I get out after a long upstairs hike, and I'm almost grabbing teh wall behind me. It was an extremely windy day and I'm not a heavy woman. However, I took my camera and started taking photos. The view was AMAZING. I managed to walk all of the way around the dome, on shaking legs, and see teh whole view. When I got back around, I realized that the people in front and behind had left. I guess they were afraid of heights too.I would do it all over again just to see the view.The inside of teh church is beautiful too, by the way. But the view from teh tower is breath taking."

We were unable to find anywhere to eat along the way so we ended up eating at Bazilika cafe & restaurant right next to the basilica and this turned out to be the worst idea possible - our food was terribly salty, small portioned, and the restaurant added on 15% service charge, which is a lot higher than the 10% norm for Hungary. We didn't want to pay it because we were not told ahead of time that we would incur this fee (which was almost 1000 HUF) and it isn't printed on the menu, but they said that all the restaurants in that area charge the same for service and made us pay it.St. Stephen's was a really nice basilica and definately worth a look around since it's free (although you have to pay if you want climb the dome), but if you're going to check it out, don't eat in the square! We noticed a bunch of other restaurants as we walked away, along Andrassy Ave, and this probably would have been a much better choice."

We went in the early morning when there was hardly anyone there. It is typically nice but the best part is the very special relic. The cathedral houses the hand of Saint Stephen. It is really cool because it is in a protective glass case and for a few coins the box will light up, revelaing the hand. You can take pictures of it, but be sure to turn off your flash. My flash accidetally went off, and the kind old man just gave me a stern look. It is pretty inetersting. There are also very good little retaurants right in that area to eat at."

They unlocked the door at 9am and we walked around before there were loads of other people with us. We intended to go up to the top but that part didn't open until 9:30. The inside of the church is just incredible and just makes you drop your jaw in awe. There was no fee to enter the church itself, but if you want to go to the top for the beautiful views (I highly reccomend) it's 400 ft. We got this confused with another area of the church that costs 300 ft to enter called the treasury. Right now there is a display of things from the 1940s, we were dissapointed we paid to enter this room as it wasn't all that interesting to us, at least not to pay and see it. I've posted pictures of what was in the room.The tower opened at 9:30 and we went up the stairs at first (not realizing the elevator was just across the hallway. We did find the 2nd elevator and got to the top for some glorious views of the city. We were the first ones up there so we had the whole place to ourselves. Don't forget to check out St. Stephen's right hand. It's mummified there and you can see it in it's glass case. You have to put some forints in to turn on the light. We didn't go in that room and my husband is still bummed we didn't get to see it. Mummified hand? Sounds gross to me, but I guess guys go for that kind of stuff. Make this beautiful church a priority on your Budapest list!"
