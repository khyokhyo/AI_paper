No, that doesn't make it any less worth a visit if you are a foodie and love to tempt your senses with the sights, sounds, and smells of desserts and cuisines galore. There was so much to choose from that I honestly wish I had more time to visit this place in London a second time, just so I could give some of the other stalls a try. There are so many amazing treats on offer that it's impossible to recommend any one thing in particular; there's always something for everyone. My only tip would be to go on a Saturday as I have heard that more stalls are open then (although it will also be more crowded)."

I have no idea how big the market is as it was absolutely packed solid, and i mean busy busy busy - but without spoiling any surprises it was a gastronomic treat - independent stalls bursting at the seams, it wasnt cheap, but certainly a place that i would love to live next door to - awesome place - probs a better experience that the Shard if your a foodie."

I could not decide what to feast on first!We settled on a savoury asparagus pie from Pieminister (smothered in red wine gravy), and stood next to Southwark Cathedral to eat. Delicious . . . and the view couldn't be beat. It was definitely a \"pinch me\" moment . . . the sparkling sunlight, scents and sounds of the London food market and a gorgeous gothic cathedral.We also bought some massive meringues and local cheese. All the vendors were more than happy to chat about their wares - which I really enjoyed.If you are a foodie you will absolutely love visiting Borough Market - I would place it at the top of my eating experiences in London. It's a super short detour from Tower of London or Shakespeare's Globe - a 2 min walk south of the London bridge."

However, the road crossing is unsheltered (although much of Borough Market is sheltered), and you may want to take this into consideration on a rainy day. We were there with a stroller and like most of the toilets in UK, the baby changing station is only at the disabled toilet near the entrance of the market. It is possible to push a stroller around the market (roads are mostly level) but I would advise against it on a crowded day.We ate from several stalls and also purchased fruit and bread. It was a good visit and we would have visited again if we had the time."

It seemed very popular with locals; this isn't one of those markets that turns out to be endless souvenir and T-shirt sales. Food is the focus--produce, cheese, seafood, raw meat. Several stalls sell ready-to-eat lunch or breakfast items. This would be a great place to eat lunch in between visiting museums or other tourist sites--it's a much better option than any cafe built into a museum."

Plan to spend at least two hours. Take your time to walk the market and decide what food to get. Prepare to be overwhelmed. BRING CASH. There is a ATM on premises. There are also public toilets. The salt beef sandwich was the best. Candy and desserts abound. Sangria and cider everywhere. The cider is funky! Not what you're used to, especially if you're American. Great place to buy fresh produce, meat and fish if you're going to be cooking. If you are traveling - prepare to check a bag or bring a cooler for your car. So many British items you're going to want to bring home with you."

When we come up to London for the day, we always come in to London Bridge so that we can walk straight down to Borough Market and have breakfast and then we take our time wandering around the food stalls sampling what takes our fancy. I always get lost, which is great for finding new treasures but soooo frustrating when you're looking for something!! When I brought my friend up last month, she spent a fortune on cheese and was dead excited to find the Ginger Pig stall as she loves their cookbooks (she runs The Wooden Spoon in Downton.... check them out in my reviews!!) We were both really pleased to find the Taste Croatia stall as well after having been there for a holiday earlier in the year as they stock the wine we fell in love with.

We had Ethiopian cuisine for our lunch and we're not impressed at all. It's just like mixed rice with veggie. A lot of things are pricey such as juice, cheese, etc at this Borough Market and not worth to get.

Still, some unsuspecting people must be buying at these prices."

Some artisan stalls are also present.Our favourite stalls so far: a cider stand with various ciders on tap, the Cinnamon Tree Bakery with gorgeous shortbreads and other baked treats (the shortbread owls are really special ... and very cute), and the British charcuterie Cannon & Cannon with some of the best sausages we ever tasted: try the pork, seaweed and cider or the veal, lemon and thyme."

There were stands for literally every type of food item you could imagine. Exotic fruits and vegetables? They have them. Unique meats and cheeses? Check. There are also a ton of food vendors selling all of sorts of hot foods. Come here with an appetite. I ended up getting a cheese toastie(grilled cheese essentially) and it was mouthwatering.

Sometimes I'll even go back multiple times during my trip because there's always something new to see, explore and discover. Not for the faint of heart, especially on the crowded weekends: get ready to be packed in like a sardine in a sea of wall-to-wall shoppers.You'll find just about anything you'd want to eat here: sausages, traditional kidney pie, local oysters, champagne, jellied eels, homemade crackers, gourmet coffee, vegetarian goodies, full vegan dinners, ethnic meats, fish & chips, Irish stew, and lots of delicious sweets from local pastry shops. The vendors change often so you never know what you'll find in the main part of the market. Along the alleyways are permanent business stalls. Don't miss them!If you are lucky enough to go during the holidays, some vendors have special holiday cakes, sweets and hot buttered rum! My favorite item at the market is and always will be the vanilla donuts from Bread Ahead. Their booth moves around and never seems to be in the same location so if you find them, buy and eat a donut for me."

It was quite easy to recognized this place. the entrance close to the bridge was quite greenhouse looking, don't get me wrong, I really like it. Especially when the light go thought the glass passed the plants inside, this place just looked magical. I found Borough Market was like a big open supermarket, lots of different stand selling nice food. it remind me of the Great Market Hall in Budapest, full of various choices of every food. I also saw some local food stand, the people could just buy cooked food directly from them and wow, they smelt great. I would of tried out the food here, if I didn't have plan later and I just ate before I got here. Pity. People were really friendly here as well. It was quit fun to walk around. I did saw interesting local food, better try them out next time."

Being a saturday with beautiful weather I could hardly move through the food take-away stalls. Unfortunately I was unable to sample the food as I had a prior restaurant booking but most of the food looked and smelled delicious. I was amazed by the range of fresh vegetables available with so many mushrooms I'd never seen in my life. I shall be revisiting but not on a weekend. There were doughnuts with custard cream oozing out of them which looked so tempting. I bought some lovely bread and free range eggs. The market is very easy to find, so close to London Bridge tube."

Both inside and outside, the food stands offered a great variety of high quality fresh and prepared foods, ranging from fresh fish, poultry, meat and vegetables, to fine sausages and cheeses, savory and dessert pies, Scotch eggs,Turkish sweets, Indian curries, interesting wines and beers, and strong coffees and teas. We visited Borough Market twice, once on a crowded Sunday morning and then on a quiet weekday afternoon, and enjoyed the different experiences both days. The location adds to the fun, on the south bank of the Thames near Southwark Cathedral and London Bridge and with train lines running overhead."

Although it was after 1.00 pm, the place was still buzzing being a full market day. We walked around the main hall and stopped to try some French cheese offered for free tasting. It was delicious and before we left the market, we went in search of the stall to buy some.There were lots of stalls selling fresh produce as well as stands offering cooked food for a quick bite and they were popular with the crowd. We saw a stall offering a great variety of mushrooms, some of which we had never seen. The fish stall had many different types of seafood. My husband could not resist buying a tub of cooked whelks. The vendor of Furness Food Hut was cooking venison steak burgers, chicken tikka wrap and wild boar hot dogs. He was urging people to try samples of the various cooked meats, a great way to entice customers. We enjoyed the tasting and bought a venison steak burger, a little pricey at \u00a37.00 but juicy and tasty. At the green market behind the main hall, were rows of ethnic street food on offer and these also attracted a queue.We thoroughly enjoyed walking around the market and highly recommend a visit if you are in this area of London near London Bridge tube station."

On the plus side, a great selection of ingredients and food to eat while you're there, but there are downsides. You will certainly not be alone, the crowds are getting bigger by the year and in some parts of the market it can be almost impossible to move at peak times. The prices, like the queues, are also rising dramatically. You will see a huge range of food and drinks, but don't expect a bargain. Make sure you go to all three sections of the market and don't forget there are also shops and pubs in the surrounding streets to see - a German Deli, Neil's Yard Dairy for great cheese, The Rake for great ale. Having lived locally for nearly ten years I have seen the transformation of Borough market from a run down market to one of the top destinations in London for tourists and locals. If the crowds and prices increase by much more it might loose its charm, but in the meantime take plenty of cash and a big bag because you'll want to take plenty of the mushroom pate, burrata or truffles home with you."

The atmosphere and diverse range of food and beverages on offer is amazing. The generosity of the merchants in sampling their wares is terrific and enables one to make an informed decision about what to purchase. We started our oddessey with a coffee from the renowned Monmouth Coffee House across the road, which was excellent. Back at the markets we sampled and subsequently purchased a divine Iberico Jamon from the Spanish outlet, Brindisa, having tried all 3 varieties on offer.Next stop was for oysters and prosecco. ..4 magnificent wild oysters with a glass of prosecco for 10 pounds. The oysters were superb.We split then, with my choice being traditional fish and chips while my wife chose a salt beef sandwich with mustard and pickle . The hake and chips were cooked to perfection and great value at 9 pounds. The sandwich was also excellent.In summing up, you are better off eating here than in a mediocre restaurant (of which there are many in Central London) because you will have much better food at less than half the cost."

Vegetarian, vegan, gluten free and diary free are all catered for in some capacity.In addition to plenty of cheese, salami, pate and chutney samples, on my most recent visit I enjoyed a delicious cheese and olive stick from Bread Ahead, stuffed full of chunky pieces of olive and topped with glorious melted cheese. A thick, gooey, chewy brownie from Oliver's Bakery was the perfect desert.I also could resist a scotch egg from Scotchtails to save for later.There is still a good choice of fruit and veg stalls, butchers and fishmongers for locals, but there is a definite touristy vibe too.

You just want to buy and eat everything. British charcuterie and cheeses along with wine merchant/bistro are my highlights. I just can't wait to go back."

I went there quite early and most of the stales were closed.So i had to wait , and have breakfast at the rather expensive and too posh roast restaurent , which is overlooking the market.My First impression was that the market was not very traditionnal , and was rather trendy and touristy. With lots of \"cool \" stalls, offering trendy food . The kind of food you see bloggers bragging about on instagram....So the market doesn't have the authentic feel to me.I thought the food was good, not exceptionnal but expensive.So, nothing to brag home about.I Had the salted caramel filled donought , and some focaccia bread from a stall, right at the middle of entry of the market. Foccacia was dry , but the donought excellent.plus, some cumberland saussage sandwich ,from a guy located at the other side of the market. Also good .I recommend the place if you're visiting the area , to see the shard ; or go to the tate museum.It's a good spot for a quick lunch.Otherwise it's not really worth it to cummute all the way down to that side of the river , just to visit the market."

I feel that whatever I write will fail to do justice to Borough Market -- the sights, smells and tastes were amazing.I already had the intent to visit Borough Market, but I sort of unexpectedly happened upon it after visiting Saint Paul's when I decided to cross the Millennium Bridge and wander along the Thames River. I was pleasantly startled by the smells of all sorts of foods lingering about the place -- the cheeses and fruits, coffee brewing and roasting meat topped off with the smell of freshly baking breadsI immediately bought a onion and tomato focaccia, sat on the curb and enjoyed. I pledged to myself that each day while I was in London, that I would come back to the market for lunch, and even a breakfast on a Saturday.There would be BBQ from Hobbs, a salt beef sandwich from Northfield Farms, a brat from the German Deli, and a roast hog sandwich topped off with rocket and an apple sauce. I sampled fresh lemon curd doughnuts, an Italian blue cheese, fudge, baklava, and it all was amazing. So much to sample and experience, and it was all wonderful.If you are visiting London, take a break from the museums, do yourself a favor and take the tube to London Bridge stations and visit Borough Market."

During my last short trip to London, spent a few hours in the Borough Market where is right next to the subway; super convenient. There are stalls selling all kinds of fresh food, vegetables, fishes and cooked food. Nice place to try local food and take some pictures.There are nice restaurants apart from the food stalls, we wen to The Fish, ordered fish and chips (since we are in London), fish soup, oysters, salad and others. Food were good, fresh and good service. Strongly recommend to business travelers if you can spare 2-3 hours (get to know more of London and local style, thus you can negotiate your business deals like an expert), tourists and food lovers."

There are a few stands I ALWAYS buy from which include: Bread Ahead doughnuts, Borough Olives (Vollo and basil/garlic greens), a mushroom pat\u00e9 stand and a cheese stand right beside it with white and green packaging! The food stands offer amazing products. Most stands give out free samples which really pulls you in because the food is that good! The market is organized mostly into two main parts and is mostly covered from the rain! It seems the front half of the market is full of the vendors selling cheese, bread, sweets, meats, veggies, fruits and drinks. The back half mostly outdoors is food vendors so you can grab a meal as you walk! I've eaten at maybe 6 of the vendors so far and have never disliked a meal. They are all fantastic!Make sure you bring cash or you can expect to wait 5-10 minutes outside of the market at an ATM. The market is best on a Saturday and I believe it opens 10-5 but have found that nearing 4 some stands already are closing up! So get there early if possible because it is a fantastic time :)"

Our recent trip covered several cities in Europe, we had the great experience to visit Il Mercato Centrale in Florence, and so we decided to give a try to Borough Market in London. Being one of the most important reasons to visit these Markets is to experience their culinary offers. Tha is something I will not suggest you do. You may go if you are looking to buy something to go or take home. The food experience not so good since there is NO place to sit to enjoy your meal and on top; the restaurants and bars near do not allow you to use their sitting area unless you buy from them (which is understandable)"

Cost wise, a tenner for the special and it was ready in a couple minutes. We tried a few of the pubs around, which were all busy but easy to get served. If you want something a bit more formal there are lots of restaurants around, but be warned you better book, even though it was mid week, it was very busy.

The market is very easy to find from London Bridge tube station and is split on either side of a small road. The site contains lots of permanent market stalls, which are more suited to those living locally who have produce to buy, and also stalls for lunch/takeaways/cakes etc.There is a bustling section of the market with a row of approx. a dozen stalls selling a range of food options \u2013 burgers/wraps/curries etc. This is where we ate and the quality and price of the food was reasonable. The market has a small seating area, relatively tucked away from the stalls and should be made substantially bigger. The architects have clearly gone for style over substance.I think overall we were a little disappointed with the market as a tourist. There isn\u2019t much to see, rather just somewhere to buy dinner, which you can do in many places all over London rather than travelling specifically to the market. The food was great, but just as good as street food available everywhere."

You will find everything from fresh fish to fresh fruit, cheese, meats, chocolates, ice creams, and flowers. Don't be shy and ask the vendors questions about their goods and enjoy a sample of the food."

The hot cooked food stands are delicious and there are plenty of cold meat, cheese , olives and bread stands. Cakes galore and even oysters. Go hungry and take a good sized cool bag to carry goodies home in. Little samples on a number of stands which is nice.

Borough Market open from Monday to Saturday, located opposite to London Bridge Station is without a doubt the best food market in London. What sets Borough Market apart is the quality of the food, the friendliness of the vendors, the diversity of the food, the location and the buzzing atmosphere. For locals it is the exceptional quality of the produce and veg. The options for vegans, vegetarians or gluten / diary intolerant individuals are varied. The market is a five to ten minute walk from Southbank pathway which is a great spot to walk down and take in the city of London. If you visit the market on a Saturday, get ready for big crowds especially early in the morning and lunch time. Borough Market features close to 120 food stalls combined with seafood and chain restaurants serving varied dishes such as oysters, pulled pork, chorizo sandwiches and fresh juices. My recommended spots include Brindisa, a fantastic Spanish restaurant, store and stall serving succulent hot paprika-fuelled chorizo plucked from the grill and plunged into a chewy ciabatta roll alongside sweet, slow-roasted piquillo peppers and fresh peppery rocket, before being finished with a drizzle of fruity olive oil. My other recommended spot would be Furness Food But which cannot be missed as it features an enormous paella pan which serves tubs of piping hot, perfectly cooked paella rice steeped in seafood stock and topped with a generous portion of chicken and seafood. Also on offer at this popular stall \u2013 Shetlands salt & pepper squid, Wild Highland venison steak burgers and traditional Malaysian chicken curry. Like most things in London, Borough Market has an amazing history. The Act of Parliament from 1754 that helped establish Borough Market in its current form was very clear about the importance of the market for the local community. The Market would, it was written, remain \u201can estate for the use and benefit\u201d of the local community \u201cfor ever\u201d. Not for weeks or months or even centuries, but for all eternity. The market is administered and managed by a charitable trust, run by a board of volunteer trustees."

But here each stand puts the ingredients of alot of their produce, so that you can see whether you have an allergy to their food. So many different options, including \"The Free From Bakehouse\", where you can get a variety of different cakes, cookies and cheesecakes, which for me is very exciting as I usually cannot eat desert!Whatever you fancy, you are most likely able to find it at Borough Market, there is a huge variety of different produce and cooked food. Everything is so fresh and reasonably priced, an average lunch will set you back between \u00a36-10, which is what you would spend in Pret anyway. A must visit in London, best place to get fruit and veg, as well as smoothies and cooked food."

This place is probably the totally best way to spend a Saturday morning. Only 2 mins walk from London Bridge station. The area is packed with loads of quirky restaurants, bars, pubs, coffee shops etc surrounding and amongst the market itself, do remember to look up as loads above the market too. However I think the real joy of this place is trying out the various foods on offer from all the stalls. You can literally eat anything and everything here, literally!!! From Malaysian, Korean, Chinese, gourmet sausages, wild boar, pies, noodles, paella, if you can think of it, you can eat it!! You can of course buy every type of ingredient you might ever want here too. Every stall sells the best quality produce or they can't sell here. The salamis, cheeses, bread, oils, veg, spices, pasta, meats are like nothing you've seen elsewhere. Many stalls are highly specialised, look out for the mushroom stall which has dozens of varieties, spice mountain, the French cheese stall, etc. Maria's cafe in the centre of the market is worth trying at least once too. Be warned the market is slightly split in two by a small side road that dissects it so do cross over and continue through the archway or you'll miss half of it! Perfect place to take those hard to please teenagers! Trust me they'll love it. Don't visit this place on a full stomach as you'll miss out and allow a couple of hours at least as there's loads to see and try."

And it\u2019s still one of my favorite places \u2013 not just in London; but anywhere.Difficult to explain why. It\u2019s not a classic produce market \u2013 you won\u2019t find endless mind-blowing displays of fruit, veg, fish or meat. There\u2019s no real theme to it. It\u2019s not specialist in anything. But I still go there and feel better for the experience.It is a bit of a tourist trap and you need to fight your way through on Saturdays. But fair enough, there\u2019s plenty for visitors to do and see in surrounding Historic Southwark \u2013 Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre, Southwark Cathedral etc. - and the Market is a great place to take a break. Apart from anything else, there\u2019s endless grazing at street-food stalls, cake stalls, coffee shops and restaurants.I mainly go to do the food shopping. And what draws me to the Market is quality, expertise and friendliness. The vendors I visit are a bit on the expensive side but the quality of their produce is excellent; the vendors\u2019 knowledge is first-rate; and they are welcoming.This is a flavor of what I do. I don\u2019t usually do everything in one visit and I avoid the biggest crowds by not going on Saturdays.I try to go early (10:00 Wednesday \u2013 Saturday is the official opening time) and have breakfast in Maria\u2019s Market Caf\u00e9. That would be a fry-up of eggs, bacon & sausage with a mug of tea. Other people might add \u201cbubble & squeak\u201d (fried mashed potato & cabbage) that\u2019s the speciality of the place. Don\u2019t have coffee \u2013 save that till later.Then the fruit & veg. I would go to one of the big stalls in the middle of the market like Turnips or Elsey & Bent. But there are plenty of places to choose from.Meat next. The Ginger Pig is the place. Unless you are a strict vegetarian at least go and have a look at the display. Mouth-watering \u2013 especially the pies that you can buy and eat straight away. If you\u2019re thinking of buying something, don\u2019t be afraid to ask the butchers about it first. They know everything. They\u2019ll also gladly slice, skin, dice or truss your meat and poultry any way you want it. The sausages and bacon are superb \u2013 but so is everything else.Coffee is just across the road but hang on for a while longer.Grab some bread (sourdough probably) from one of many stalls \u2013 I don\u2019t have a preference.Then browse Spice Mountain. If you thought you\u2019d seen every spice under the sun, think again.Perhaps it\u2019s fish rather than meat today. Then off to Furness Fish Markets. Just stand there and photograph the display or lash out on lobster, dover sole, halibut, tiger prawns or whatever.Time for a break from food. Visit Borough Kitchen Cookshop. Inspect the rather pricy (but top quality) kitchen implements and perhaps buy the latest thing you need to improve your cooking standards.Then find Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy for what I think is the finest selection of cheeses in London. You will probably have to stand in line to buy something but the wait will be worth it. All the staff are experts and will insist that you try a few samples before you buy. If you can\u2019t make up your mind (or are just overwhelmed) they will tell you what cheese has just reached perfect maturity that very day. If you don\u2019t want to buy just politely edge around the line and take a quick look in the main part of the shop \u2013 you have never seen so much cheese.Now it\u2019s coffee time. You\u2019ll probably have passed Monmouth Coffee, which is just round the corner from Neal\u2019s Yard, and seen a line out in to the street. You have to join that line to buy a cup of coffee and to get a place at the big communal table in the shop. Breakfast there is great \u2013 you get loads of fresh baguette and homemade jam (at least it tastes homemade).Top tip: if you want to buy some beans or ground coffee just avoid the line and go straight to the counter on the right. Discuss today\u2019s roastings with the servers and order a cup of coffee to go while you\u2019re buying your beans. Don\u2019t bother about the espresso machine; go for today\u2019s filter coffee that is being made under your nose.Then do what I do \u2013 find somewhere nearby in the street to sip your coffee and watch other people enjoying Borough Market."

A little on the expensive side, but certainly a great choice, I just wish we had another day free so that we could visit again while still in London. Most certainly make sure to add this place to your \"must see\" list for London. The entire market area is under cover, so if you experience any inclement weather this is somewhere to be out of the weather."

This market is a great place to buy English food and priced well. The down side is seating. Hard to get a seat where you can enjoy the food - personally I don't 'eat and walk' so I would suggest a short stroll to the river where there are many spots to sit. The local coffee shop there is good but not as good as the queue might suggest. The oysters were fresh shucked and served with a crisp white at a small shop close to the Monmouth coffee - an excellent option. Evidence of a few 'overly' touristy places starting to creep in with USA style chocolate shops and non uk food. Well worth a look as part of the south bank experience."

It's always hard to find a place to eat in London as the prices can be really high, that's why I wanted to try the market. It was a bit hard to find the place at first as it's location isn't the best in my opinion, but our visit was worth the search. As everyone have mentioned, it can get crowded, but that's London, it's everywhere like that so you just have to choose the right time. We had some hummus and pita bread that was very tasty and later some donuts, that tasted incredibly. What I love the most about that place, is that it isn't THAT big and you don't have to walk around and hunt for the best prices. There are so many different options and you can find whatever fits you the best. Good place to have a cheap lunch, quick breakfast or just a tasty snack as a takeaway."

Toilets are available and after wandering around the market, tasting produce samples, eating your hard decided food choice and dodging the huge crowds, you can venture out of the market to the river and see the sites of the area, which includes Southpark Cathedral and a great view of The Chard.

Applebee's is one of the best fish restaurants around and can be found on the West side of the Marley - book to avoid disappointment or be prepared to queue - it's worth it. There are a number of others. The market itself is during summer and holidays absolutely heaving with people so if crowds and pushing and shoving are not your thing - stay away. However if you can deal with crowds there is a massive selection of street food, market fruits and produce, wine, hams , fresh fish and meat and everything in between. This is largely a produce and food market but fantastic olive oils, spices and wines can be had gift wrapped or otherwise. The market can be accessed from London Bridge Station, by walking from Warterloo - maybe 20 to 30 minutes or by bus from Warterloo or St Pauls. Don't forget on of the most beautiful but smallest cathedrals in the UK is located here - Southwark Catherdral - well worth a look around and opposite th market is the Menier chocolate factory - now a dining place and theatre and well worth a look.

Only discovered it last year even though I have been living in London for 26 years.A market full of so many stalls with a variety of stalls......food, drinks, cheese, meat, poultry spices, vegetables,fruits, flowers, restaurants etc. Just love strolling around the market, taking in the ambience and the atmosphere. Yummy doughnuts...... Delicious toasties....juices...... Burgers..... Fish and chips.....Love the Spice stall, colourful fruit and vegetables displays. There is also opportunity to taste the produce.If I lived closer to London Bridge I would visit every week to get my fruits, vegetables and cooking ingredients."

A roast beef sandwich from Roast-To-Go. A chicken burger from Wyndhams. A cup of prawns.Too much. Too much. And, yet I still had room to stop by Gelateria 3Bis (not in the market but nearby) for gelato. Because, you always have room for gelato.A note on crowds. I arrived at the market at 1:28 PM on a Friday. It was crowded. You can check my photos below to see how crowded. Understand that the crowds are spread out among the various stalls. This does mean that there will be a line for popular stalls. Others might not have a line at all. I never found a place to sit down. So, keep that in mind when buying food."

If you're looking for food products, either to bring home, or eat on the spot, this is the place. Very interesting products of all kinds, from cheeses to spices to meats, veggies, etc. etc. When it came time for us to have a bite of lunch; where to go? So many choices. All looking very appealing. We finally chose the only one we could find with seating. Big mistake! It offers mostly some type of burgers with a number of choices of meat. Some of these not so common. Of the 5 of us, we all agreed that we chose the wrong place. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the place, but you can't miss it. It also has a metal fence surrounding the seating. Other than that, this is THE MARKET."

The market was bustling with activity, lots of locals & tourists. Great choice of fresh farm produce, home-made goodies, food, drinks, fish & fresh cuts, flowers & foods from across the globe. We found baklava, Turkish delight, falafels, Indian pickles & chutneys, spice mix & even Paella. I really think this market needs more marketing to attract tourists. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there eating, drinking, buying things to take back. The little corner with the live cooking class was a nice place to just hang out & relax too. Thank you Borough Market for such a grand experience"

It was easier to reach getting off the tube at london bridge then bourough and walking down. I went at lunch time on a very hot and sunny saturday so yes i did expect it to be busy and it was. There was a vestibule area with seating in if for people which was full in contrast to the large alfresco areas marked out for the surrounding resturants which were empty. There was a large variety of differnt cuisines avalible but there were more then a few stalls that seemed to be exact duplicates of eachother spread through the market. I also noticed the prices vairied rather massivly between each stall, the apple juce for example was \u00a32:50 at one stall but arround the corner was \u00a33:50 which made me rather weary about buying anything as I looked arround and becase of how busy it was i ended up deciding not to go back for the stuff i saw and bought from the out skirts instead as there seemed to be a handy road encircling the market allowing fast movement arround it.For what i did buy~ \"whirled\" fudgeThe rum and raison was delicious the salted caramel wasnt to my taste but others liked it well enough the cidre fudge was alright but nothing impressive.~ Apple juiceI don't remember the stall name for this but thay had a lot of differnt fresh juces, 7/8 differnt types of apple juice not bus the standered apple and blackcurrant but diffenrt juices from differnt varietys of apples. It was chilled the cups being kept in broken ice (which was the reason i bought from them) which was just what i wanted on a hot day.~ \"Pieminister\"Deer Stalker pie, mash and peas. Venison bacon red wine and lental pie, nice crisp pastry well filled pie though it was a little short on the meat inside of it. The potatoes were hot mashed potato a little bit lumpy but delicious non the less. The peas were supposed to be minted which i couldnt taste and they also seemed hard.~coconut pancakesI go back and forth on this one. It was a crisp bottem filled with what i can only compare to semolina that tasted like coconut they were a nice meld of sweet and savory but the texture was stright from school dinner.All in all it was an enjoyable trip but not the market to go to if you want anything other then food or somewhere to sit."

If you arrive at it by descending the steps near the south west end of London Bridge I defy you to be anything less than sorely tempted by the hot food on display at the establishments immediately to the left at the bottom of the steps.There are plenty of other attractions at or near this Thames-side area including The Shard, the Old Operating Theatre, Clink Prison Museum, Shakespeare's Globe and Tate Modern.

My trip today included a detour to buy some ice-cream on a hot afternoon. The Greedy Goat ice-cream stall sells a number of flavours of ices made out of goats' milk. My favourite flavour is raspberry with chilli. Today, I tried apple pie. It was delicious - spicy and appley. Just perfect, and cooling."

You can purchase anything from cheese to plants to fruit to spices to fudge/chocolate to biscuits/cakes. Plus lots of street food to eat there and then. Pieminster sells fabulous pies available with peas and gravy which went down well with a lovely medium white wine eaten out in the open."

My recommendation is to try the salt beef (not the store along the streets but the store under the bridge). Don't waste your time or money on the fish and chips there.2. Some stores have samples, try them to taste more food! 3. If you like coffee, try the coffee at Monmouth Coffee, its quite good. 4.

The market is made up of open stalls and shops. There is everything from fishmongers, meat stalls, fruit and vegetables to olive oils and olives and truffles and mushrooms and bakeries etc etc etc There are also quirky shops to visit as well. Plan on having something to eat here. So much to choose from pasties, pies, Asian food, Egyptian food, German Bratwurst, curries, Indian etc etc etc. Everything is made fresh to order and oh so delicious. Free samples are to be had at most stalls. My favorite were the pies especially the beef and Stilton. We enjoyed goat ice cream ...yes ...goat ice cream : rum and raisin flavour which was so rich and creamy and smooth. Finishing touch was a real sugar donut filled with vanilla pastry cream....to die for. If purchasing food from stalls does not appeal to you then there are many sit down cafes and restaurants from which to enjoy a meal. Put Borough Market on your list of things to see and do. You will not be disappointed. I assure you."

There is a diverse array of permanent merchants who sell meat, produce, cheese, fruits and vegetables and others who offer freshly-prepared snack foods which you eat in any quiet spot you can find in this busy place.

Mmm, maybe but it would be early on as I wouldn't want to try and navigate though the packs of people again if I could avoid it."

Average cost \u00a35.00 per serving.There are fresh fruit juices and drinks stalls too.Great market and thoroughly enjoyable.

This time, made sure to plan to see it, and did so on the day we visited Globe and Tate, both nearby. It was fun to see, but was all food (produce, meats, cheeses, specialty gourmet items and restaurants), no wares or goods. Fun if you're into markets (as I am) but wouldn't recommend going all the way there just for the market, if not seeing other sites in the area. Nothing too remarkable or particularly unique. I'd say go for lunch while visiting Tate or Shakespeare's Globe or if you're wanting gourmet food items."

You will find nice cheeses there as well.You are a desert person? Brilliant, they sell many cakes etc. They are having vegan and gluten-free versions, whole cakes which they sell in nice card boxes. They sell ice cream there as well. Sounds boring? They use goat milk. I didn't try as I don't like goat milk but I am sure it tastes good.They close around 5pm on Saturdays. From 4.30 the two fish sellers sell their fish for half price. If you come from London Bridge and then pass the first fish sellers on your left, there is a vegs shop that sells their juces for just \u00a31 before they close.

Great tradition from yester year.There is the Roast restaurant sitting above the market from which, along with great cuisine you can watch all the comings and goings of the market below."

Whether shopping for fresh meats, produce, cheese, baked goods, wine, etc., walking around eating and or drinking at the great fresh food stops in the market, eating at a nearby restaurant, hanging out at one of the pubs, or getting a hair cut at Hobbs Barbershop, Borough Market is always a great experience. Conveniently located next to the London Bridge tube station, the market is one of our favorite places to hang out during the day in London."

The place is in good size - smaller than the market in Camden Town, but you can leave with a full stomach. I absolutely love the food there. Scotch egg is my favorite. I tend to order it as my first dish. It's hard for me to finish everything there especially much food is pastry based, like the German hotdog, or the pitta bread with meat. Last time I had so much food and on top of that we crossed by a fish and chips place and ordered again. That was a wrong decision made. I would advise people to pick the food carefully - the portion of food there is hearty and unless you have people to share the food with, it's good to just pick 1-2 choices. Overall I think the food there is tasty, yet the price is bit high considered it's popularity. I find the place bit touristy like too compared with the similar food market in Camden town. Yet I would still highly recommend the place for people for a first-time visit, especially if you want to go to the market, then enjoy a walk near the river towards London Bridge and Tower Bridge."

There is a sense of street market with lots of things to eat, and also good coffee (the best of our trip). There are also meats, fish and fruits and vegetables.Some stalls are not open on Tuesdays, but there is certainly enough to make it a worthwhile exercise.Beware there is only 1 public toilet, with a huge queue.

This is a real food heaven ranging from the traditional fruit, veg, fish and meat. Then special produce cheeses, breads and street food area. Plus a number of sit down restaurants too. You could easily spend most of the day and a lot of money in the market, so it's best to plan carefully what you really want to see and enjoy. We liked the cheese stalls, Italian truffles and street food - be prepared for long queues and no where to sit. I think this is the only negative about the day - there is virtually no seating unless you are dining at a restaurant. Otherwise I would def recommend Borough market for a half day visit."

The food is mostly foreign, simple, fresh and delicious. Try finding the pulled pork sandwich with Bramley apple sauce. For sweets, avoid complicated stuff like macarons. Go for simple things like cannel\u00e9s from Bordeaux instead. Try a shot of grass so you can tell a tall tale, not for the taste :-)"

And if you are peckish or thirsty, well, you can have anything you want here: paella, curry and rice, hand-dipped chocolate strawberries, French cheeses, house-made Italian pastas and sauces, pastries, fruit cups and freshly-squeezed juice, soups and stews, hamburgers, and even a good old Scotch egg butty with brown sauce. You could probably eat from a different stall twice a day for a month and *still* not visit every one. The only thing keeping me from giving that 5-dot rating is that there really aren't many places to sit down at all; this is either an eat-and-stroll stop, or you can take your food back to the riverside and plop down somewhere.

I came for lunch and the selection is plentiful from all the different food stalls. Whats really cool is that the food stands offer a range of ethnic food. I actually ended up choosing Ethiopian. With the choices of beef or chicken, and then the choice of 2 sides and rice or the Ethiopian injera. It was a great choice for a winters meal for a cold day and great value for money. We also grabbed a pulled duck sandwich. Something you wouldn\u2019t normally find at a markets. The only downfall is that there isn\u2019t a heap of seating to sit down at.There are food stands for all reasons, whether its fresh bread loaves, turkish delights or quick lunch.

The goat was delicious and I will have to go back to try the kibbeh and souvlaki. 10/10"

We sampled meats, breads and cheeses from local vendors, picking up some great items for snacks.There are many to choose from, so look around before you make your choice. If you want a hot meal, you can find plenty of pulled pork and other handheld lunches or you can sit in one of the many \"pub\" style restaurants that offer a more extensive menu.

The fresh oysters are superb - 1/2 dozen of succulent ones for only 5.50 pounds ! The coffee is so aromatic that you just cannot miss it! Then there is the aged balsamic vinegar with healthy enzymes and truffle honey... Great stuff! "

It's pricey if you're after a food shop or any hefty amount of sustenance, but it's wonderful for a little pot of spice here, a delectable brownie there, and a free taste of everything in between. Bonus points for being surrounded by bakeries, coffee shops and cook shops - the temptations never cease! It's at its quietest and best on Thursdays but Friday and Saturday are fine too - just don't leave it til Sunday if you're only around for a weekend. It'll be dead!"

If you've only a short time in London, I definitely recommend a visit to Borough market - it's a really lively spot,soak up the atmosphere and stroll around the food stalls, you can even get a glass of prosecco on tap to walk with, before deciding on which foods you'll eat! My favourite was the 'empanadas'. Close by is the Shard for some amazing views of the city, there is a charge to go to the viewing deck - instead, go to the hotel at the shard (wear shoes), pop up the bar and get a drink and the view for the same price.And finally, close by is the River Thames, its a lovely walk and you'll pass by 'the globe', Tate Modern Art gallery and over the bridge to St. Pauls - so take you pick :)"

Lots of shops and vendors offer free samples so you can munch while mulling over your options.

We came here on a Saturday, We drove and it's ok to park on a single yellow line at most places in the borough of Southwark. We parked on Southwark Bridge Road which was about a 7 minute walk. But London Bridge underground station is just opposite the market entrance.The market itself is divided into two, one side is worldwide street food and the other is food ingredients more for take home purpose. We arrived here late morning which was starting to get busy, then went to clink prison, came back and it was packed. So top tip would be to get here early morn and avoid getting stuck in popular queues such as Ethiopian and Thai stalls. Quality of food is excellent and caters for many specialities like meat, fish, cheeses, vegan, smoothies. Also we tried a little bit from each stall to avoid getting full too quickly and try to indulge in as many cuisines as we could! Prices are not cheap but not as expensive as London restaurant prices, plus portions are very generous. We loved it, and we'll be back again for sure but the word EARLY is the key..."

If you are a Foodie, it's a must seeWe went back to see it as the first time we arrived it was late and everything was closed up but some of the small outdoor restaurants were still open and the buzz was fantastic. We were so glad we went back on Saturday morning. It was alive and packed with stalls selling all sorts of food , meat , fish , cheese , veg, baked goodies . You can buy fresh food to take home and cook here or buy cooked food and eat it as you walk around. There are some cafes and restaurants there also . So something for everyone. This is a vibrant market and you are sure to see things that you may not have come across before in the culinary world."

It is fascinating, entertaining and even if you are not going with the intention of buying groceries you will definitely come back with some super original mozzarella, some baby avocados or a massive slice of baked cheesecake! Obviously not as cheap as a market in the suburbs but the range and quality of the products is impressive.

It was impossible to stop and look or sit and eat. We finally found a nice place to duck into for some wine and a bite to eat, Bedales of Borough. Everything else was pretty much a waste of time.

We went on a Friday morning in May, arriving soon after 10.00 am when it was easy to move between a great variety of truly excellent food stalls, meat, fish, fruit, baking, olive oils, truffles, a cornucopia of fruit and vegetables, wild mushrooms, cheese, plenty of street food from Indian to Eygyptian, Middle Eastern, vegetarian, sausages or burgers in baps, hog roasts, fish and chips as well as oysters and plenty of other choices to fill the senses. I found great stall called Mini Magoos selling delicious coconut, ginger seed and nut mixes, gluten free granolas as well as other yummy morsels.Another stall sold British produced salamis including a superb Ndjuda sausage made in Sussex. There was gold medal winning Caerphilly, a great selection of soft and hard cheeses from a cheese maker from Bath.Lovely fresh, bright eyed fish.A goats milk icecream stall selling light clean flavoured ices.It made me proud of British production.Much as we loved it by noon it was getting crowded and by 1pm we decided to abandon our plans for lunch as is was heaving. We wandered along the South Bank, instead, past the Globe Theatre, merchant houses, over the Millenium Bridge.A lovely day out!"

Street food here is typically very, very good, but its not exactly cheap. Here, even the street food has adopted Lonndon prices. It can get incredibly busy on weekends to the point where you can't really move and its really not much fun, but once the majority of the crowds have moved on its a much better experience and any queues to the street food stalls will move quite quickly from then on. Borough Market is definitely worth a visit, the atmosphere is great and you do get a sense of \"old london\" when you're wandering around the stalls under the railway arches. Its also close to other tourists sites and easy to get to so you've got nothing to lose even if you just want to drop by to say that you've been."

It has food for everybody, which makes it even more difficult to decide what to delve into there and then or take home as a treat. I would recommend that anybody visiting London takes a trip here because it's such a great vibe! So chilled and so much choice. Love it!"

We made the mistake of queuing for coffee (took 20 minutes as they clearly were more into the product than delivering!) but the result was tasty. Picked up a stunning pot of mixed spice that is going to wow my apple pies and carrot cake. Three wrapped coated goats cheeses for \u00a310 was my bargain of the day and now having eaten two of the packs, can advise they did travel well on the train and were one of the best creamy smooth cheeses I've had. Close to some lovely pubs and the millennium bridge it was worth making a day trip for."

Cons: Not really a sit down and eat place, you will need to eat most things on the go. Can be a little difficult for those with kids."

It is easy to get to, right outside London Bridge tube and is situated in a railway bridge as you can hear the trains passing overhead, you will be amazed at the variety of food. There are huge selections of fresh fish, meat, cheeses, breads from all over the world. If you can think of it, they have got it and the stall holders are happy to provide samples with the possible exception of truffles. A lot of the produce is organic and artisan, it is not cheap and you probably would not do your weekly shop here but the quality is first class.The sellers make a huge effort in the way the produce is displayed and it is a real treat to take it all in. There is probably a 50 / 50 split of stalls selling food and places where you can also eat. There are also plenty of restaurants in the immediate vicinity and you are also in a good area to wander around eg London Bridge, the Shard, Southwark Cathedral and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre are all nearby. Well worth a trip."

We left with a loaf of freshly baked sourdough and smiles on our faces."

My husband and I both enjoy the variety of foods and the ambiance and always pick up good cheese, roasted cashews, salami and bread for a picnic or late snack in our hotel room. The prices are very reasonable and you can see and smell the freshness of all. The vendors are friendly and welcome all to sample whatever they are specializing in. There are now many stalls of prepared foods from Roasted Pork to Stir Fried Rice. Then pick up dessert of fudge, cakes or Turkish Delights. My husband favorite is the Pork Buddy which is filling enough to last him all day and I can never resist the custard tarts. It's easy to get to the Market by way of the London Bridge Tube Station (Southwark Cathedral) and walk under the railway. Mostly you just follow the crowds. Saturday is overwhelmingly busy but worth it. There are side shops (Neals Yard for the queen's choice for cheeses) and lots of pubs surrounding. Visit the beautiful Southwark Cathedral also....just steps away. It's a fun time for any age at any time."

We went to Borough Market on a Friday afternoon, and were immediately taken by the vast range of foods, spices, and drinks. From smaller stands under pop-up tents, to larger stores with fixed locations, the selections were endless, and all seemingly of higher quality. As a foodie, I could have gotten lost in this place for DAYS!. The range of options was spectacular -- from locally sourced meats, to cheeses from around Europe to my personal favorite, Brindisa, which specialized in foods from Spain. Breads, cakes, charcuterie, teas, coffees, spices, flowers, -- the list is almost endless. Some sellers offered samples and everything we tried was quite good. The layout is a bit like a rabbit warren, and it took us a while to get oriented, but it was completely manageable. There are food carts here as well that serve meals -- Ethiopian, German, Middle Eastern, Indian -- you could eat your way around the globe. Although it was quite busy, the crowds weren\u2019t overwhelming. Going on a Friday afternoon I think we were able to avoid the huge crowds here on weekends. We ended up purchasing some things to take back home with us, and some food we would have on our stay in the UK. All in all, I am very glad we went and if I lived in London, I think I would be here every week. I will definitely go back when I am in London again!!"

I wouldn't go there to actually order my groceries or buy day to day stuff, but as a treat it's certainly worth it. You can get to the main market a variety of ways, there are lots of small side streets that filter in from various angles so you can stumble across it while exploring Borough and London Bridge quite easily and while avoiding most of the main routes too.There's a huge selection of stalls to choose from, either produce like mushrooms, fruits and veg, to cold meats and deli items like pies, sausages, fresh rabbit and eggs, through to stalls selling a variety of delicious things to eat on the spot such as hummus, biscuits, sweets, burgers and cheeses. It really is a world tour and if you can go on a slightly less busy day (pretty hard) you can have a great time trying free samples and ogling the more expensive stuff.It's really nice to grab something from a stall and take a stroll down to the riverside or The Golden Hinde or there are plenty of great pubs in the area, expensive but if it's a treat it's such a nice, vibrant place to meet people for an afternoon.There are covered areas but not many places to actually sit down inside the market itself, so be prepared to hover or lean somewhere to eat your snacks, take some handwipes to clean off the ketchup and oil and enjoy the smells and sounds.I have often purchased a few pies and meats for Christmas and there's a great world beer stall where you can buy gifts for the beer lover in your life!"

There are 8 or 10 eateries inside the market but keep in mind these do not have seating, so you have to carry your lunch around!! Many vendors will give samples - cheese, olives, chocolate, meats.Allow a couple hours to fully explore, but be patient as the place can be very crowded. However, relax and take in the smells and sounds of this London gem!"

This ancient market, just outside the City of London, has transformed itself to remain extremely busy and lively in the modern age; some staples are still sold, but it also caters to higher end tastes, with a number of places to eat and drink.It is near the end of London Bridge, once the only way across the river from the City, by Southwark Cathedral and hemmed in by Victorian railway construction, taking very busy lines right past it on viaducts. Indeed the railway project laughably called Thameslink 2000 has affected the Market in the last couple of years.It is well worth visiting, whether on one's way somewhere else or just for the never ending fascination of people-watching.For all that, I was very surprised to see it graded as London's 15th most popular tourist attraction; if I stood at Heathrow quizzing outgoing passengers I would be very surprised if more than a few had ever heard of it."

The market is mostly under cover, except for the walkways in front of some of the food stalls. It is busy, hectic, a bit of a maze that makes it a tiny bit hard to explore, but a feast for the eyes and senses, particularly if you go around tasting where samples of cheese, olive oil, pastries and other items are offered. It is a bit disorderly and dirty compared with the markets we visited in Barcelona and Vienna, and offers less impressive displays, but still makes for a very nice time if you like wandering around viewing and tasting product, and possibly eating at one or more of the food stands.

The variety of foods, the people, the activity of a live, working market all added up to a delightful morning walking around, talking to the vendors and sampling an extensive variety of street food including a British pie, a Scotch egg, a salted beef bagel, a raclette and potato dish, pastries, fruit cups, and on and on. Our sampling took care of breakfast and lunch and pushed us to a late dinner because we were not very hungry as the dinner hour approached. It is a definite must see and experience!"

There were different foods available but many were duplicated and not that exciting. We'd walked the whole market in 20 minutes, it reminded me more like what you'd find in a large farm shop. More seating around the market would be helpful so you can enjoy eating the food rather than having to eat while walking and bumping into people all the time.The food we did have was all fresh and tasted very good and we would likely return if we were nearby."

The place was lovely, and not as crowded as I expected, even thought it being lunchtime and just right around the corner from London Bridge. The small stalls under the high domed roof gave the place a very nice atmosphere, and there was no shortage of choices of what to eat. After trying out two stalls for food, and two stalls for dessert, we left the market with full tummies and in a happy mood."

It was a great place to take my 15 year old son - he enjoyed all the tasting opportunities! It was a lovely place to go if you fancy trying some different fayre to that offered by supermarkets. Well worth a visit therefore. Very near London Bridge station so is easy to get to - but if you go try and go early - it was heaving by the time we left after lunch! If you want a chance to browse at your own pace go early! We'll be back to buy some more goods another day!"

But thats the fun of it - you might not pick a full-on winner everytime, but its the choice!

But what I found was a place of great trendiness. I saw a single Scotch egg on sale for \u00a34 - Yes I know it may well be a fantastic scotch egg, but four quid...Basically the place was awash with stalls selling all sorts of food at exorbitant prices, I guess this is a sign of the times - How much can we rip off the gullible for. Would I visit again?? No, not for me, I don't like being jostled by groups of Americans or Italians whilst looking at products aimed at the \"Trendy\" cool kids who hang out here."

We arrived at 8:30am on Saturday. Not everything was open yet and we had a little wait for shops to open up for breakfast. I enjoyed a (vegetarian) dosa and my husband a breakfast bap. Shop around for a breakfast bap if that's what you fancy as the fillings and prices vary. You can buy all sorts at the market although there seems to be a lot of bakers compared to other stalls."

We visited Borough Market on a chilly morning in February and had a great time taking in the sights and using the excuse of staying warm for extra eating and drinking. Not only is the food all amazing, but it's also absolutely beautiful to look at. The shops displayed thoughtful, appetizing arrays of artisanal meats, produce, pastries, and amazing prepared foods.The Raclette and grilled cheese shop was a favorite, as was the curry. We enjoyed warm coffee, mulled wine, and spiced cider to keep warm. I can only imagine how long we would have stayed to enjoy ourselves on a warm day. It's my understanding that the market has undergone significant expansion and a facelift in recent years, so those who visited in the past may want to give it another try."

Borough Market is mostly about food in all forms and shapes. It isn't as large as I might have thought. It seemed to have only a few stands of each type, like fish, vegetables, cheese, bread and so on but the quality of it all was impressive even though I obviously didn't try or taste everything. You really should check out this place for yourself. I'm sure you will find many interesting foods to buy and/or try. Note to self though: English mustard is too strong and takes over even the most delicious salted beef so if offered - stay away :)"

There are lots of stalls where you can grab a lovely lunch at a reasonable price, and stalls with exotic cheeses, meats, fish, mezze, cakes, chocolates, breads etc. to take home with you. There are also a few nice pubs around the market. The whole area tends to get very busy at weekends though, so the best time to visit is on Saturday just as the place the opens in the morning.

I wanted to go back before we left, but didn't have time :( The only reason I gave 4 stars was because it was a little crowded. Don't let the crowds be the reason you don't visit this place. If you keep walking further up the mall, you can get a view of the London Bridge as well. The Globe is also very close this market, which we ended up visiting right after.

We went there in late October on a weekend day that just so happened to be Apple Day, a day where they were celebrating local varieties of apples. There were exhibitions, entertainers in period costumes, and just a lot of things going on.If you like seafood, there were at least a few stalls that had local oysters on sale to eat there or takeaway. I had a few and they were quite good. All in all, I would definitely head back to Borough Market the next time I'm in London. If you want to avoid the crowds, I strongly suggest you get there early before the tourist buses start dropping people off."

I actually just love walking along the Southbank promenade next to the River Thames, whatever the season you really feel that you are in old London town.If you would like to be based there then I would highly recommend staying at Premier Inn Southwark, London. I've stayed there many times and everything I have mentioned here and much more is within a 5 - 10 min walk. Very clean and comfy and breakfast is served in a pub connected to the hotel which overlooks the river Thames, literally a few meters away and is said to be the oldest pub in London! Hope this helps...have fun. ps there is a great Nandos restaurant built into the arches under the bridge just outside the premier Inn hotel. Have fun and enjoy!"

The market is located under some above ground train rails. But it doesn't feel like you would expect. Because you are surrounded by great food and cute little vendors, the location adds to the atmosphere. If you are coming to London, come here at the beginning of your trip so you have some good food for meals or snacks while touring around. But the full market is open only Wednesday to Saturday.

I must say though the coffee from mamouth was very nice and at average cost of Costa/Starbucks but much smaller sized. Breads looked nice but not something I couldn't find in my local Waitrose apart from cheese and olive bread stick \u00a32 which I ate with my salami. My partner enjoyed her German hotdog and her giant cookie which was smaller then what saw on YouTube yet the same price of \u00a32 that enticed us to the market.

Lots of stalls selling food. We went in the wine bar which was very nice. Will visit again when we in London but will go earlier so we can see it all."

In fact, it's hard not to blow your budget on all the wonderful goodies you can find! I especially like the raw goat's milk from Ellie's dairy, the rye sourdough from The Flour Station and the seafood from Shellseekers Fish and Game. Just a great place to walk around and soak in some memorable sights and smells!I prefer markets when they are not too packed with tourists, so I thought Friday morning was an ideal time to visit - all the stalls are open, but there aren't too many people about before 11-11:30."

This is something of an institution and feels it, with an air of confidence and permanence mixed with the fashionable, the ephemeral and the just passing through. The customers are a similar mixture, regulars mixed with casual visitors (like us) and tourists. Not cheap but generally authentic and real, with quality to the fore. Cheeses and charcuterie with a bias to France and Spain (artisanal), meat and fish, mulled cider and wine, fresh breads, plenty to eat on the spot: some of it more appetising-looking than other. One of the buskers had a varied repertoire and (for a while) a coterie of excited girls, which added atmosphere. We were there on a Wednesday lunchtime and it was busy: what it must be like in peak times hardly bears thinking about, but if you like the sights and smells of varied fresh foods it is well worth a visit."

We were however offer a taste of small ravioli with cheese and white truffle filling and were blown away. In a corner of the market you will find the smaller, mobile stalls and that is where the most eclectic choice of food gets sold. You start off from British food and visit European delicacies (the Balkan stall looked yummy), on to South America and Asia. In the end, we went for the white truffle mini ravioli and a scrumptuous stake and ale pie with mash, mushy peas and gravy. They made for a delicious lunch experience when sitting at the available common tables under the large canopy sheltering us from the rain and wind."

It was also good to get lunch at one of the many street food stalls, again we found this to be great value and were happy to stand and watch the world go by while we tucked into some amazing dishes like roasted pork and salt beef sandwiches. Having been to many food markets in my time I think Borough holds its own against some of the more famous European offerings and I actually thought it was a lot better and had more choice than Barcelona\u2019s La Boqueria.

Sunday it is closed, and the other days the opened shops are restricted.There are a lot of different things to see, lots of local specialties, which are always interesting to see.All in all, a very interesting stop when in London (and it is possible to eat for 2 persons for 10\u00a3 or less, see my review of Tua Pasta, a real luxury in London!)."

I spent many of my weekends as a teenager in Camden shopping my way through the stalls, eating and drinking tea. This time I graduated to foodie haven Borough Market.Nestled beneath the arches of London Bridge, Borough Market is a market of two personalities. On the one side, the indoor part of the market is full to the rafters of food producers, suppliers and importers. From butchers to cheesemakers, craft beer sellers to a guy claiming to make the best doughnuts in London, whatever your passion, you'll find something that takes your fancy. For me, its charcuterie and cheese.I picked up a\u00a0lovely hunk of\u00a0Bresaola and a wild boar salami, before moving on to one of the many cheese stalls to grab a slice of my favourite cheese, French Comte.Outside on the other side of the market, it is bustling with street food traders serving dishes from all over the world. British classics sit alongside African staples. Chinese noodle bars rub along with grilled cheese sandwich sellers. Its a cacophony of sounds, smells and temptation. On the recommendation of my cousin, who lives just around the corner from Borough Market, we went for a Scotch Egg from Scotchtails.This was a little beauty, with a thin, crispy coating, juicy pork and a soft cooked egg, served on a bed of rocket, generously seasoned with salt and cracked black pepper. The egg was enough for me, but they also come with a side of sweet potato fries for the dedicated.It is a little touristy at weekends but still definitely worth a trip for the fantastic produce."

Sited underneath railway bridges and squeezed up against Southwark Cathedral, it's a glimpse of an artisan London which is increasingly difficult to find. It's busy, noisy, sometimes a bit shabby around the edges but full of character and a source of some of the best organic food. Other reviewers have listed what's on offer - everything from organic fruit and veg to Sicilian olive oil, Swiss cheese, home-made jams etc My favourites are 'Bread Ahead' for the freshest sourdough bread baked in workshops overlooking the nearby Southwark Cathedral (and their freshly baked salted caramel doughnuts are a must too); Wild Beef for the freshest eggs (trust me); Paul at Sussex Fish who brings the day's catch to Borough up from the south coast (plus Paul invariably has a mixed tape of 70's music blaring away as he works); the Cool Chile Company for your Mexican BBQ (chipotle paste, fresh corn tortillas, jalapeno peppers); Spice Mountain for an astonishing range of spices and peppers; The Olive Oil Co for peppery olive oil; and Monmouth Coffee for bags of beans to grind at home. It gets incredibly busy here at weekends with visitors roaming the stalls for snacks and street food, so if you are here to shop try and arrive before 10h30. This market makes you excited about food again..."

I personally liked Roast Hog\u2019s roll with roast pork, apple sauce, rocket and crackling though La Tua Italia also has great fresh pasta.

The stalls vary, but you will find fast food, butchers, fishmongers, wine, beer, sweets, Spanish produce, Italian produce, cheese, bread, tea... well almost anything..There are few pubs and wine bars to sit in when the feet get weary and a visit to Borough Market wouldn't be the same without popping into the Market Porter for a swift half. There are restaurants to refresh the batteries in and just sit an people watch. If you don't visit London often, then I would recommend starting here and walking along the Southbank taking in the views of London, the Tate Modern and the festival hall as you go."

I was last here 5 years ago and it has grown in size and popularity since then. The market is wedged under a roof and railway arches next to London Bridge tube, Southwark Cathedral and Guys Hospital, just a stone's throw from the Thames. If you can spare the time walk here along the river and enjoy the scenery, Golden Hind etc along the way. If there is one thing that you need to take with you to Borough Market it is an appetite. You will find game meat, enormous wheels of cheese, vegetables, flowers, cooked food of many types [Reindeer Burgers in December!], bread, cakes, chocolates, wine, olives, more wheels of cheese and many, many take away food stalls - I feel hungry remembering it all!The market gets VERY crowded. Monday and Tuesday there is a 'Lunch Market' only. On the other days the full market is open and the best time to arrive is 10am when you can walk around before the hoards arrive."

There seemed to be a 50/50 split between street food stalls of every nationality and food and drink outlets ranging from Swiss cheese to Croatian charcuterie. The food outlets are not cheap but you are getting quality and in many cases uniqueness. It was not as big as I imagined and does tend to sprawl around various streets rather than being contained in a central hall. Well worth a visit but don't expect any bargains."

It is a market teaming with food and drinks from a multitude of countries ranging from Latin America to Europe and beyond. From the Dutch raclette to the Scottish Haggis, you can find pretty much most delicacies here. I can strongly recommend getting to the market, grab an delicious coffee and then stroll around whilst your eyes start to take in the many delicious dishes on offer. Try the cheeses, taste the cured meats and then start making up your mind as to what you would like to eat. Look out for the homemade black truffle pasta, the handmade gins and many other delicious treats. If you are looking for a deal consider visiting the market about an hour before it closes when often many of the stores start running specials as they need to get rid of their fresh produce. A great place to spend a few hours."

Despite the artisan bread and cheese stalls there was little evidence of good British food. Where are the pork pies, black pudding, stilton and British cheeses etc.Great if you want anything not British with the exception of some organic fruit and veg. Didn't see one jellied eel or any pie and mash. "

The cheeses were spectacular and I ended up buying several of them. Also chef Theo Randall was there doing a live cookery demo and whilst this looked amazing I wasnt able to try what he cooked as I dont eat meat and both dishes had meat in them! There was also a chance to see large parmesan cheeses being cut and to try different aged parmesans. Really informative as well as able to try delicious cheeses!

This remains one of the city's best places for food, and the best among the myriad of choices are the chorizo roll from Brindisa and the duck confit from La Marche du Quartier. Both cost 5 pounds and are located near the main entrance at the intersection of Stoney St and Park St. To get to the market, the nearest metro (tube) station is London Bridge on the black and gray line. If you plan on using public transportation more than twice per day, buy an Oyster Card (not a Visitor Oyster Card) for 5 pounds, then add 6.40 pounds per day since this is the daily cap for unlimited public transit use in Zones 1-2 (these zones encompass almost all tourist sights like Big Ben, Buckingham, Kensington, London Eye, etc). The 5 pound deposit is refundable if you go to a counter at any tube station before returning home (otherwise you'll have to request a refund by mail)."

Sadly did not get to many other stalls due it being very crowded and simply could not get people to move by being polite, next time we will pick a quieter day or bring a cattle prod. One other thing that maybe a one off, but a couple of places the smell of human urine was a bit much to take.Will certainly give it another go, but maybe on a weekday."

It was an enjoyable walk around the market exploring the different kinds of food there, from bread to cheese to truffles to cookies to hot food! Seeing a shop selling seafood, we promptly bought 3 scallops with bacon and vegetables for 6 pounds, which I felt was quite worth it as the scallops were fresh and big. Then we got duck confit burger, which certainly lived up to expectations! (all our friends told us that duck confit is a must-try at Borough Market!) I also went for Boston Sausages, where I got a sausage burger with 2 sausages in it for 4 pounds, which was quite worth it too. We also got cookies and brownies which were amazing. I would say that it was a really enjoyable experience for someone who loves food and wants to try a variety of food. The food is quite worth the money and it is definitely worth a visit."

The place is really, really busy and for me a tad claustrophobic and too jostley... I got separated from my husband a lot because of it.. basically the other people there are too selfish to allow for people who find it difficult to walk to keep together in a crowd. The place was smelly and in a walk-through' area it smelt of urine (probably from the pub crowd in the evenings) but it didn't seem to bother the people were sitting in it and eating... We could not find anywhere selling a simple cup of tea or coffee .. there was smoothies, fruit juice, spiced apple juice, chai and coffee (in very small waxed cups for a lot of money) .. However we did buy chocolates, bread and meat pies, which we took home and they were both very, very good. the pies were from Ginger Pig and we would like to get some more if we go up to London and the same with the chocolate from Chocoliscious, the bread from the Flour Factory was excellent and tbh the produce we bought was excellent and very good value. If there was a little more space to sit and get a coffee and maybe some kind of system to walk around it would improve things... it's not that I don't get it is a market in London.. grew up in London during the 60's and 70's but for someone who has limited mobility due to rheumatism in ankles/knees and hips and so walks slowing and needs a sit down it wasn't easy."

Apart from all the other great things happening including a venison burger that I usually would not eat (venison in Oz is a bit like Kangaroo - VERY strong), it melted in my mouth. Finally, Richard Haward's RARE COLCHESTER OYSTERS - yep, they are a cut above my home town Sydney Rock Oysters BUT, the other ones (local Rock Oysters?) have nothing on our TASMANIAN NW and St.Helens OYSTERS. All things being equal - this spot is a MUST for any food appreciative person.

We sampled many cheeses and even purchased some to bring back to the states. We had a delicious lunch at Pieminister and Khanom Krok, even if we had to stand while eating it. For dessert we shared a brownie from Olivier's Bakery. Made a few other purchases from the various vendors as well. I do think it's important to say that even though it is an outdoor market, it is not a discount market. But that's usually the case when it comes to anything regarding quality. Definitely go there. It's worth the trip."

My son-in-law decided on a vegetarian Indian curry while my daughter and I have vegetarian Pad Thai which was my first experience of this pleasing dish and all reasonable priced. I started eating it with chop sticks but even with a fork is was difficult to eat elegantly when you have to stand to do so.

You had me at beef rib sandwich with horseradish cream. What a crispy, fatty, meaty goodness on a roll example of sandwich perfection. They have other sandwiches, but this seemed to be the sandwich of the day. If I were local I would have picked up some local cheese at one of the stalls.

My parents visited and told me to visit with my daughter due to the selection of cooked food but also all the other things available there. Getting to Borough Market is easy enough, use the underground and go to London Bridge station; when you exit the tube station they have signs telling you which way to go.Once in to the main part of the market you will see so many different products available; fresh produce - meat, fish, vegetables - made produce - cheese, chocolate, olive oils, wine, fudge etc. There was such a selection of different things you could buy to take home and being just before Christmas there were quite a few places selling tasty mulled wine.In the Green part of the market you have a lot of stalls cooking fresh food; the selection is great - Pad Thai, Indian Vegetable curries, Scotch eggs, salt beef sandwiches etc. The smells were fantastic as were the queues for nearly every seller in the area.My daughter and I had already decided we were having pork sandwiches and we got them from Hobbs but we descended on Khanom Krok for our coconut dessert. A little pricey compared to Thailand, \u00a33.50 for 8 - but they were delicious and got eaten very quickly.We bought a selection of different bits, fudge, some fresh brussel sprouts for Christmas lunch and some cheeses. In all it was a great visit and we will be going back to try some of the other stalls and restaurants in the area. I love the fact that a lot of the sellers have small samples out so you can try their produce before buying it, but it does tempt you to buy far more than you need.If you are foodie, or not, I would suggest a visit to the market just for its business and all the things being sold. We had a great time and will be going back soon."

Great selection of local cheese, meats, olives, and lunchy food. Mulled wine, and local beer can also round out a nice lunch. Can get very busy during peak tourist times but still worth a visit, get a selection of treats to take to a local park. Don't miss the Market Porter pub at the back of the Market, across the street - a very old pub serving a large selection of \"real ale\" on handpump. Best place for great cheese and interesting people watching."

The freshly cooked lunch and meals bit is great, that paella and curries from the fishmongers is amazing.

Borough Market is London's oldest food market....It has won this accolade through selling produce of the utmost quality and provenance, moving with the times and generally being able to interpret what its customers want.....Herein lies the crux, many of its customers have money to spend, are food snobs, and think of nothing if paying \u00a35 for a sausage roll or Scotch egg; and consider such a cheap eat! So if going to Borough Market, do be prepared to pay premium prices....Afterall, the place is continuously name-checked and championed by style magazines, top chefs and Guardianista types.. And hipsters-yuck!On my recent visit, I was overwhelmed by the varied cuisines on offer, the delightful smells and presention of the food as well as the magical ambience! It is worth noting that top-notch non-food establishments also exist within the market area (Hobbs barbers) and on the periphery of the market (The Wheatsheaf and Market Porter).....A visit is bound to cheer you up no end, even if window shopping..."

Also a good place to head for during the week - nice pubs like the Market Porter and the Anchor are nearby, as well as a famous ship (the Golden Hind?) and the Globe Theatre. Also Vinopolis and numerous decent restaurants.The downside? So many people around, it's sometimes hard to get through the crowds! Lots of interesting stalls selling all manner of food: meats of all sorts, cheese, tea, ready-copked curries etc, vegetables, fruit, wine. You name it, it's there.To really do it justice, you need to set aside at least four hours. None of it is truly indoors, so dress appropriately and bear in mind that you could get wet if it rains."

The only disappointing part was that I couldn't eat everything and I went on my own, so I couldn't share / try a lot of different foods / snacks with other people. If I lived in London, I would just come back until I tried everything. Went on a Friday during lunch time - lots of people, but great fun. You can get a good lunch here for around 5 pounds (which I think is less than McDonalds in London...crazy). There's a free restroom (just one toilet each for males and females) and some benches to sit (if you're lucky to find a spot) in a covered area...sometimes this is all you're looking for after sightseeing in London for a week."

Within minutes I was literally drooling (yes drooling and grinning) by the Pad Thai stall. Blown away by all kinds of cooking, got a mulled wine and wandered. Had a steak and \"sydney\" pie from pieminister. It was delicious! There were burgers and paella and cheese and sausages and I obviously knew nothing about this place but it's obviously the place for lunch! Don't read my ramblings just go!!!"

For a start it housed under the railway arched with glazed Victorian roofing to fill the gaps and huge cast iron columns and bridge supports. It was probably a genuine food and veg market in the past and there is a till a lot of fresh and exotic food on sale. There are also lots of home made food products and hot food stalls selling all manner of British and foreign dished, and all mad keen to give you taste. it's also busy and noisy with the odd train rumbling overhead. It's an amazing sensory experience.If the market is not enough to interest you, next door is Southwark cathedral, an oasis of calm, and other tourist attractions on the river frontage. I recommend ending you visit with a walk over the Millennium bridge for a good view of the river."

            "review": "Excellent market but note disclaimers/tips below. I've divided my observations into pros, cons and tips to enjoy the market.The reasons the market is great:- The vendors as generally very friendly and enthusiastic about their products and you can feast on so many samples of great ingredients, you may not have space for food- It is a great place to pick up gifts for any foodies in your life, produce and products are often British or otherwise 'artisan' or rare- Great seasonal offerings to enjoy on the day, like mulled wine or hot cider in the winter, fresh fruit juices in the summer- Probably an amateur photographers dream - visions of rabbit and fowl with fur and feathers still on them hang from one stall, a bounty of mushrooms at another, a rainbow of fruit at another- Long history as a food marketThe reasons I am sometimes dubious:- You get what you pay for. This is not a bargain farmers market. It has a lot of very specialist items and the fresh produce has become pricey to match the rental price and location. Foreigners on a weak currency may find it pricey - Brits from outside London will find it pricey - Londoners often find it pricey. You could be paying about the same for a burger as if you sat down somewhere while now you have collected a burger from a stall and are hovering in the cold, standing to eat it- If you go in the weekend, it is VERY crowded, VERY. If you go midweek, it is a lot better but the atmosphere is not as good- It has become increasingly commercial- Not a good place for a quiet chat and catch up due to the fact you will spend a lot of time walking behind each other- If you don't have access to a kitchen, unfortunately you will see a lot of produce you want to buy but can't cook or eatTips:- The market is liveliest on a Saturday. But if you brave Saturday, do so by 9am at the latest which will give you about 2 hours before it gets really crowded and the people with prams who want their kids to stare at other people's bums while running over your toes turn up. Otherwise just go in the week, slightly less vendors but slightly less people too. Note: this is a Saturday market, not a Sunday one - Keep your bag close to your body and closed, it is crowded at any time so a pick pocket dream- If you go as friends, try get the vendors to cut sandwiches etc for you so you can share, try as many things as possible. Personal recommendation would be the chorizo and pepper rolls, the bacon and scallops, the brownies from the Flour Factory and the grilled cheese sandwiches- Do a quick tour before picking what you want to eat or you may regret not having the stomach space or the budget to get what you really wanted but saw too late- Get what a stall seems to specialise in, the best items are by stalls that do only a few things. I once got a very overpriced (over double what I usually pay) pastei de nata from a bakery stall and it was phenomenally disappointing but they had too many elements to do everything well- There are some good bars and restaurants in the area in general. If it is a nice day, it's great to do the river walk from Borough Market, stopping at the Tate Modern, the Globe theatre and the National Theatre (which often has outdoor events in the summer for free), possibly picnicking off what you bought at the market to Waterloo- Dress warm in the winter, it's sheltered from rain but still exposed- Not really suitable for prams or wheelchairs - not so much because you can't navigate but you have limited space to do so- At the risk of sounding obvious, draw some cash from an ATM (there are loads) nearby or come with some ready cash before shopping - not all stall holders will take card!"

Initially we had to endure the very noisy leftover lunchtime Christmas party goers, but as it was the season to be jolly we excepted this in good spirit until it became a battle of song between a table of males v's females, chanting names and attempting carols !! We were seated very near to the air conditioning unit, which was blowing out streams of cold air. We asked on several occasions for it to be turned off as it was extremely cold, we also pointed to another guest on the other table who ate her entire meal with her coat on, she was clearly feeling it too !! It was not attend too. I asked for the cocktail menu, I was given one between 4, we asked the waiter if her could recommend any long or virgin cocktail's and he just looked at us with a blank expression. He clearly had no idea about the drinks. I then asked him about the items on the main menu, his knowledge was extremely limited, I also asked for the vegetarian menu, which did not appear for,some 15 minutes and then that was after several reminders. We ordered our wine which promptly arrived and was poured but we were not asked to try first. Our starters arrived, I order Stilton with beetroot, I know it is called fine dining but my plate seemed to be missing both Stilton and beetroot, however I had plenty of green leaves with a delicious dressing. Our mains arrived, but no vegetables or side dishes and at no stage were we asked to order any, and as this was our first visit I presumed they would arrive with something other than four slices of beef and a Yorkshire pudding! My overall experience was extremely disappointing, I felt the staff had very limited knowledge of the menu and overall contents. Their English language and understanding was very sparse. Sadly a very disappointing experience, extremely expensive and one we sadly will not be repeating."

In the summer you can sit in the yard of the cathedral and eat your food/drink your coffee and in the winter you can sit in the glass extension. The selection of types of food is just great, something for everyone: Tasty Asian, Afro/Car./ European food, something for Vegetarians, the list is vast. There is a nice pub right in the centre of the market and you can sit under cover to have your drink. The atmosphere is great and buzzing. Combine this with a visit to the nearby Shard for an interesting morning/afternoon London trip. Yes, it gets busy but that has never deterred me from returning over and over again."

Heaps of fresh fruit and vegetables, platters of seafood, huge speciality cheese wheels, crisp organic breads and just about anything else a food obsessive could be tempted by is available at this ancient and enduringly popular market. The ingredients are of the highest quality, but also often with prices to match, so if you're looking for an affordable meal it's best to join the queues for one of the burrito, burger, hog roast, falafel, raclette or other hot and delicious lunch stalls.The market gets so full as to be no fun at all on Saturday lunchtimes.

Here the past and present seem to have little difficulty in rubbing along with each other. There are plenty of food stalls in the enclosed area for every taste bud, but if you want to sit in relative comfort there are a number of excellent restaurants to chose from. I tend to use 'Fish' which nestles below Southwark Cathedral, and is always fairly busy when I visit. The lunchtime menu is not that expansive but what's on offer is more than sufficient. The fish dishes never disappoint and there is wine and local bottled real ale to choose from. If you have the time it is worth dropping into one of the nearby public houses. With glass in hand you can almost imagine you have travelled back in time."

Borough Market may not get the aerial pan like London Eye or Tower Bridge on TV shows or movies when the setting moves to London, but this is yet another must-go destination for all London tourists!Showing the hipster side of London, Borough Market is an open-air market under the London Bridge railway. Here, you will find not only the traditional market vendors like produce or butcher stands but also exotic unique goods that you may not see often elsewhere such as venison dogs and Egyptian street food. You don't have to buy anything to be intrigue by this terrific market, but at the same time, can you really resist the alluring aroma from everywhere if you aren't full?I highly recommend coming here as a lunch break between Tower Hill and Westminster. Keep in mind though that most food vendors accept cash only and each order is generally \u00a35. However, there is an ATM on site, and some vendors that charge higher prices do accept credit cards so don't fret if you forgot to bring cash.Whether you are hungry or full, definitely make your way to visit Borough Market!---TIPS TO GET THE MAX:1) The best way is to simply wander around but grab a map for information2) Take a walk around before committing to a food choice: the vendors won't go away on the same day!3) Bring cash4) General seating area with information and restroom is on the intersection of Southwark and Cathedral Streets---tl;dr version:1) Awesome open-air market near London Bridge2) Classic market vendors along with exotic unique choices3) Perfect lunch spot but a must-go destination at anytime!"

We all had something different from a different stand as there was simply so much choice and everything smelled delicious. I had a scotch egg and salad. The others had and grilled cheese, a burger and a Thai veggie noodle varied but would definitely go again if we fancied fast but good food. We arrived as it was finishing up for the day and so I would love to go along in the day time when all the stands are open. Probably some lovely Xmas gifts available here."

Queues at all hot foodstalls and such a variety, and then on to buy the freshest meat and such a variety of vege for tonight's meal (I mean amazing varieties of mushrooms, aubergines, tomatoes and any colour of beetroot!). Need a rest then nip round to Monmouth's for a coffee. But, beware time has a habit of evaporating here... And don't forget to choose your cheeses before you leave, If you can tear yourself away.

It is a place to get lost and let your foodie dreams take hold. Half of the market is enclosed and the other half is open air. So, don't be deterred if it is a rainy day. The market has almost anything that you could want. My colleague had chicken curry while I was tasting French cheese at a stand nearby. My favorite booth was the Raclette served Swiss style. We ordered broiled raclette scraped and served over new potatoes with cornichons. So very good. We also found mulled cider, mulled coffee, white truffle honey along with Nutella-filled donuts. We even found Grenadian nutmeg syrup at one of the vendors. Overall, a great place to get lost in a foodie paradise for two to three hours. Tip: Located near the Shard building which has amazing views of central London."

I read that Borough Market is the market which you shouldn't miss when visiting London. The market is closed to the London bridge which you can access by either tube, bus, or any other transportation. We stepped into the market, the first stand comes to my eyes was the Oyster booth. It was just the right season for this delicacy and people were waiting in line ( good sign). The oysters were super fresh and immediately as for the second dishes. After that, we walked into the market, you can see various stand with cheese, bread, olive ,and many more! You just don't know where to focus on. Be honest, if I could, I would love wrap pack the whole market away!!Later, we went to the other section with the instant deli where they served German, Greek, Chinese, Ethiopian food , and many more. Shame that I have one stomach only. Overall, it's good place for you to spend a half day where you can enjoy the fresh good,purchase some groceries, and have good time with friends.

You can spend hours here if you are a goodie. Our girls (age 10 and 11) loved it but I would have liked to take them as younger children or in a pram due to how busy it is."

If you like food (and you are ready to spend over the odds) this is a great place to be, the food selection, the quality, the variety, the sights, the smells, everything is brilliant if you are a gourmet or like nice food or you are just curious about world cuisine. All of this comes at a price, that in my experience is worth paying. If in South London pay it a visit"

Visited on a Wednesday mid-morning as the full market is open (Mon/Tues open for lunch only) and we were advised it would be less crowded than weekends. It still got pretty busy by lunchtime at the food stalls though. Great atmosphere, vendors were very friendly and called you over to sample their food. Everything was so enticing. Try it all!! Definitely a must see place for foodies....so sad I can't bring most of the goodies back home on the plane!! Drop by the guest services office to sign up for newsletter and recipes and check out their website before going to see if any special events."

I tried the roast duck wrap, very good especially with the special made extremely spicy chili sauce. My wife bought hummus and warm pita bread. We also tried grill fresh scallops which I think was just okay. There were several stalls that sold similar dish but I guess I didn't pick the right one. I also bought some dried mushrooms to bring home for cooking. We had a good couple of hours here. The location was very convinient just a few hundreds yards away from tube station."

Maybe people say there are Chinatown, Walthamstow etc, catering those variety, but why only sell apples and berries etc, ready available from supermarkets?

As you'd expect for any decent food market there are a wide range of international cuisines catered for including some I'd never tried before including Egyptian. This is in addition to numerous stalls selling artisan breads, charcuterie, cakes, chocolates and fudge etc.The queues for some stalls were quite long, but it was almost lunchtime. However, the longest queues were for the toilets, so be prepared to wait if busy. After browsing most of the street food stalls I headed back to the stall for Scotchtails for their runny scotch eggs with sweet potato fries for \u00a37 (recommended by a friend), which were very tasty. My wife and I were fortunate to find a couple of chairs, as seating here is limited.This is a nice food only market to visit, well worth adding to your itinerary if spending the day in South London."

It features some of the best veggies, cheeses, meats and olives in the world but reality is it is an experience everyone should try. Then while you are there you can pop in to the Southwark Catherdral across the street which is free and amazing as well."

Even though it was absolutely packed with people, we managed to get round most of the market stalls. There were some locals shopping for fresh food at the attractively set out fish, meat, vegetable and bread stalls, but there were also throngs of tourists who seemed more keen on photographing food rather than buying it. Despite that, the stall holders all seemed cheerful, enthusiastic, helpful and knowledgeable, encouraging us to sample before purchasing. We had a delicious, fresh, hot pulled pork and kimchi baguette from a stall for lunch, followed by a cold beer and a welcome sit down at one of the many handy bars around the periphery of the market. I bought some great specialist cooking ingredients too."

Get one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches in the world, or his raclettes. Those are potatoes with melted cheese and gherkins. If you are there late, vendors will make you some swinging deals to unload their goods. Pastries and breads can be half price or less.

There are many food stands for a wonderful lunch. And there are special places, like Brindisa, where you can buy many Spanish products, cheese and the best olive oil. Borough market is a must see for tourists and a great place to shop for quality ingredients."

You really need to be going home with your goods on the day of your visit so for us it was difficult to buy much as we had 2 nights in London and no cool bag to stash stuff. Free tasters going on everywhere, cheap prosecco to sip on as you walk around and an abundance of lunch choices. The foods on sale are wonderful - a lot of exotic fruit and vegetables that you probably only find here for some of those extravagant recipes. We will definitely visit again but ensure we come with a list of wild ingredients to buy and then go home and cook!!!"

We went during the week when most stalls are open. This is a great market for locals for fresh breads, produce, meats but also a great place for tourists to meander and grab a bite. We tried several food items (fresh bread, pasta) and we're huge on Italian food and breads but we always find the English spin tends to be a bit bland so the food we had was very good but not the best we've had. I give the disclaimer we're big on spicy and flavorful which is not to everyone's liking either. I would say I have had better bread from our local island bakery and better in France itself and better Italian in London and Italy. We spent a few hours here and enjoyed our visit, we did research in advance to understand the history. For those on the west coast of the US, this might be likened to Pike Place in Seattle (in my opinion much tastier food options and amazing florals and crafts) or Farmer's Market in Los Angeles (the food and produce stalls, not all the souvenir shacks)."

First treat was a carrot, ginger, apple juice at a fruiterer's stall. Next decision was lunch! We did not wander far to find a diver's scallop stir fry served on a shell and a venison burger (about 6 pounds each, prepared before your eyes!).....then, despite the rainfall, we headed outside to the temporary stalls offering a variety of international street foods! Could not resist the German brat mit kraut.(about 4 pounds 50)...better than the christmas market staple, probably because we weren't freezing! Desserts and sweet treats were plentiful and good. Rum-raisin fudge, by the piece, was buttery good, as was the giant dark chocolate chip cookie from the french baker's stand. Thai coconut pancakes anyone? Argentinian or Balkan street treats? Donuts? Cheesecake? Yummm bread! Cheeses? Paella? Curry? A musician played ,crowd was manageable, probably due to rainy Monday! Great day to view all the stalls and look over-and smell- all the products. So much easier to do this leisurely stroll on a rainy Monday than a busy Saturday morning! Note that a few of the stalls were closed on Monday, but still many good spots to visit! Bring pounds and wet ones; street food is impossible to resist-and messy!"

Getting there by tube from Leicester Square station, you have to take the Black Line to Waterloo station and then switch to Grey Line going to London Bridge Station and exit from there. From London Bridge station you can visit the famous London Bridge before walking back to the market. There are many fruits, vegetables, pastry, cheese, etc and even exotic foods like crocodile, zebra and kangaroo meat on sale. Some fruits like nectarine are also sold at a wholesale price of 6 pieces for 1 pound! I tried a cup of hot and spicy cider from a stall which tastes out of this world. After you have done your shopping here you can adjourn to Hay's Galleries and the Tower Bridge close by to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Thames River and its surroundings."

The prices are \"market\" not \"London\" and when you've finished gorging on the fare, you can relax with a glass of Champagne and re-charge the batteries before strolling on to numerous other attractions nearby including The Shard and Monument."

The market is an iconic landmark in Southwark London, just like the shard building is (which can also be see close by) except I doubt you will get such nice food in the shard for such good prices. The market has appeared in a number of films and even music videos, but it is the food there that really stands out. This is far from a tourist dominated market, with most people (tourists and locals alike) going there for there wide selection of fresh and seasonal food. The market is a eclectic collection of independent produce sellers and food stalls selling any and everything from fruit and veg to exquisite white truffles. My advise is go at lunch or at least hungry and try everything the market has to offer, as it boast a wide array of international cuisine. It does tend to get a bit busy and you may need to queue but there were so many sights, smells and sounds to take in it is hardly notable."

Next, we moved to the desserts. Again there were lots of options and the prices were reasonable. We enjoyed it so much we returned on Sat. morning. However, the market was so busy you could barely walk. Also, we found ourselves in a different part of the market without all the vegetarian choices. So if you are a vegan or vegetarian, remember to go to the part of the market that is located just next to the Southward Cathedral."

Also plenty of food & drink stalls with a variety of produce to suit all tastes. I must say that I thought it all a tad expensive for a 'market', so you will be hard pressed to grab a bargain, unless, perhaps any perishable goods are sold off cheaply at the end of the afternoon.One major drawback seems to be the distinct lack of seating anywhere. Just a few eateries & bars have some seats, but no where near enough for the footfall that passes through.I do not however wish to be too critical, as Borough Market is somewhat unique and certainly well worth a visit to wander round.

Omg, I was hearing about this place before but all this time I spent in London I didn't have much time to visit.Finally on my last Saturday I went there.It was absolutely amazing !! Basically borough market has two different parts. When you enter the door near London bridge station,the main door, you can find different species of olives,oil, bread, sausages, cheese, mushrooms etc. and also a few places to eat but when you keep walking through these things you will find another part of borough market called 'green market', that is the place of eating different kind of foods from all around the world. I saw a long queue in front of sth I don't remember the name but it's close to the entrance of green park. It was melted cheese with boiled potatoes omg it was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten I regret not eating one more time and I regret putting borough market in the end of my list:( by the way, don't go there with more than 2people it's very difficult to hang out with your friends in that crowd."

I use Borough Market to stock up on spices, and whilst likely to be more expensive than surrounding ethnic supermarkets, I love the choice, the vibe and the opportunity to taste food from other stalls.Once finished at the market, I would recommend walking down to the Thames and taking a stroll in a westerly direction along the river, taking in The Globe theatre, the Tate Modern gallery, Southbank, then crossing for either St Paul's Cathedral or the West End shops.

Even on a fleeting visit such as mine it was an enjoyable way to spend the time. I will go again when I have more time and will definitely buy some of the produce next time and plan my visit over a mealtime so I can enjoy a leisurely lunch."

Borough markets was recommended to us by two different guides at London attractions, as well as Rick Steeves.

I had intended to get breakfast at Borough Market but had been put off by impression that after 9.00am it's too busy to get close and as such excluded it from our itinerary.As we slowly walked up the riverside from Tower Bridge we'd lost the path at London Bridge station. As we backtracked down towards the station there was this amazing smell in the air and someone passed us with a Bratwurst. We headed down the steps and walked straight into Borough Market.The smells, sounds and atmosphere is as every market should be. Within ten minutes I was already stuffed having consumed 'brunch' in three courses. My only regret is as we walked further in was that I had neither neither the time or space in my stomach to enjoy more.There is something for everyone and for every purse. I just wish there was more seating so you could watch the world go by. Plenty of banter between the store holders gives the impression that it's not just the locals and the tourists enjoying the market.Don't be put off by the warnings of crowds and be sure to visit with an empty stomach."

Purveyors come on different days, so best be safe and go to the Market on Saturday.It'll be crowded, but that's part of the fun!We actually built this visit (not our first) to London around the Saturday market.

The wholesale market operates on all weekday mornings from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m.The market is located on Southwark Street and Borough High Street on the southern end of London Bridge.I mentioned it is a part of London history.

Wander here first and grab a bit to eat, tons of options anything from vegetarian asian street food to Scotch eggs and Venison burgers, and a drink and then wander around Southwark along the Thames to the South Bank, that is my idea of a great day out."

Borough Market buzzes with frantic energy from early on a Saturday morning to later afternoon selling everything from fresh produce, kangaroo burgers, organic wine and some of the most gorgeous looking cakes and treats they really are very hard to resist!!It is well worth battling the tourists to enjoy the sights, sounds and smell from this organic market in London. Join the queue at Monmouth for coffee before sitting down on the pavement with freshly made food from one of the many stalls or get away from the crowds by ducking into one of the restaurants in and around the market.Definitely worth a visit even if it is only to people watch!"

Don't get carried away and buy too much because there are quite a few, and you might end up with more than you intended to buy. Don't forget the shops around the area (the cheese shop at Neal's Yard!). Even if you aren't planning on buying fresh produce you can just go there for a meal and enjoy the vibe.

It is always packed but we really like to walk around, get some samples, see what they are selling, smell the fresh fruit, have some lunch! It is really lovely there.Also, from 4.30 on they start selling what is left of the day much cheaper so we always buy some fruits and veggies there. So fresh and tasty!"

A great variety of foods and ingredients to either eat on the spot or take away. Great cheese stalls including 'Drunken Cheese' aged in alcohol and a variety of locally sourced cheeses. Fresh fish stalls one of which served the best and freshest calamari I've ever eaten. Yes, it is touristy but for a reason - Londoners also enjoy the variety here. Worthwhile, but beware if you're on a diet!!"

Like many people, my initial thoughts of London attractions went to Big Ben, Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, etc. Those are fine, I'm sure, but treat yourself to Borough Market before shelling out major pounds for those other places.We walked to Borough Market from our hotel near Tower of London - only 20 minutes. All I really knew was that it was a big farmers market. That's true, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The first thing we noticed was the variety of goods - not just fruits and veggies but meat, fish, cheese (lots of cheese), baked goods, beverages, etc. Cold or hot, fresh or prepared, there's something for everyone.The second thing we noticed was the quality and presentation. Sometimes in big public markets with big reputations, you come away thinking it's all mediocre and overpriced. Not here. I grabbed a piece of baklava that was among the best I've had. My wife treated herself to two macaroons - earl grey and vanilla - that she would have paid 3-4 times as much for in the U.S. We also paid five pounds for five small jars of jams and jellies, the flavors of which we would never find at home. Oh, and there are a few pubs right there as well.Bottom line: We loved it so much that morning that we swung back through for a snack late that same afternoon - and this was when we had only one day in town. Between this great experience and the overall location, there's really no excuse for not going to market while in London."

Whether its\u2019 picking ing up some meat from the Ginger Pig, Jamon from Brindisa next door, your morning coffee from Monmouth across the road, walk 10 metres down from Monmouth you will find Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy for english cheeses, in summer a wide variety of english cherries will be available. Opposite Neal\u2019s is the German delicatessen. All this before, one even enters the heart of the market itself. There is produce form Croatia, local ciders and beers, fruit and vegetable providores, French Comte for cheese and saucisson ranging from wild boar, truffle, walnut. Farm yard butters, seafood, breads. Our friends couldn\u2019t understand why we wake up early then travel an hour instead of going to a Waitrose or Sainsbury to buy food to cook them dinner. Believe me it worth the effort. Just remember to go early on Saturday to avoid the crowds. Enjoy!"

Beautiful sunshine, walked around the various shops/market stands and had a good time exploring the market. Tasting various items. I had a good impression from all the stands there, quality product at ok prices.I visited again in July (1 point). Once again beautiful sunshine. But: Crowded beyond capacity. It was no fun at all walking around (or rather: being pushed around). I did not enjoy that at all. Would never go there again in July.So my tip: I you have the chance: Go there in the off season or shoulder season. You will enjoy it much more."

The vibrant atmosphere of this market will seduce you with its colors and flavors. Unforgettable was the rice noodles cooked in front of my eyes, but also the freshly baked bread, cheese, fruit, fish, a great food bonanza just a short walk from London Bridge Station."

Everyone is super friendly. Taste everything you can. Go for the cheeses, the salami, the honey, the Turkish Delight. Hunt around till you find the guy selling the chocolate wine - it is surprisingly delicious. Test pomegranate oils and buy a mug with a painted Hairy Coo on it. Check out the gigantic cookies and try the venison. If you love fruit, it's here. If you love seafood, it's here. Fresh juices - yep. A quick snack or a full meal, you're sorted.

The raspberry with white chocolate brownie was yummy!I had lunch at an Indian booth and it was excellent. Many places offer gluten-free options and I found that the vendors, and London restaurants in general, are very good about ensuring that their selections are gluten free if they say they are.And for all others without eating issues, go for it!nit was a lot of fun!"

I ended up buying a Italian focaccia, a kangaroo burger from the Exotic Meat Company (kangaroo, really!), Turkish baklava, Spanish ladr\u00f3n peppers, Italian Ubriaco cheese (cheese soaked in red wine), Mexican habanero peppers, Grenada Guava jelly, and Argentinian alfajores. Yet not only was the food wonderful but the prices were very reasonable and the vendors were very friendly, offering you samples as well as kindly discussing their particular product. If they didn't have what you were looking for (i.e. the Swiss and French cheese place didn't have the Swiss cheese Appenzeller that I was hoping to find), they would kindly recommend other places to you.I would highly recommend this place to anyone going to London. While it's very crowded depending on the day you go (I went on a Friday), the food and the different cultures represented were both outstanding and the people watching even better!"

Good selection of food stuffs from cheese to breads, fried food, from local cuisine to exotic African meals. Most are just stalls which you buy, takeaway and stand around to munch. The prices aren't really cheap. We had a scotch egg and salad for \u00a36+ but it was real tasty.The famous Monmouth coffee was \u00a32.50 a small cup of latte. Tasted a little bit more \"fragrant\" than normal Starbucks. Perhaps it's the fresh roasted coffee beans. The grilled scallops and oysters were really fresh.

There is so much to see that it can be a little overwhelming initially. Each time I go I always try to navigate my way around in an orderly fashion so as not to miss anything but each time I fail as I get drawn away by something that catches my eye!Most of the stalls allow you try their wares before you buy and the vendors are very knowledgeable about their wares. It's such a shame that I can never buy all that I want as I live so far away and my trips to London normally coincide with a journey elsewhere after my visit to the market. I thoroughly recommend anyone to visit Borough market to experience the sights, the smells and sample the delicious food!"

Many stalls of cheese and breads, but lots of other things too. Great gifts and souvenirs can be found here also. We had some great iced coffee from one small stand.

This is the BEST way to spend a free morning in town. A quick walk from the London Bridge stop, tons of regional and local vendors selling all kinds of handmade, organic products. It's part farmer's market, part craft fair, part food court. If you catch a stand without a big line you can really talk to the vendors about their products and how they're made. Most of them are intimately involved in production and/or know the history of what they're selling really well, so it's like a museum you can chat and eat your way through. There are a few great places for food, and a couple of wine stores that sell cocktails to go so you can wander the market with your prosecco and enjoy. When you've seen it all, you're close to the river, within walking distance of several tube stops and well on your way to places like London Bridge and Vinopolis."

The next day I went for seconds; this time I ask to add more shrimp for an extra pound. Other vendors were selling what it look like a hamburger with a bratwurst as the main ingredient. Other vendors were selling jellies, ham, fish, paella, etc. It also a good opportunity to take pictures. You do want to have a story to tell when you get back home.

Big place with many stalls carrying a wide variety of food types. Breads, cakes, meats, salads, desserts, sandwiches, drinks .. you'll find them all and more. From the main area, we crossed over to another building that had even more and bigger stalls, so move around so you don't miss anything. Our favorite was a small stall that served a mound of melted cheese on top of boiled potatoes. Worth standing in the long line."

You may smell something intoxicating as you arrive but I would suggest you resist the urge, walk around and see what is there before you buy. You may discover something you like even better! There are some vendors who only sell food and there are some who sell packaged products such as spices, jams, relishes, coffee, tea and fresh pasta, The vendors are very welcoming and encourage you to try their products. There are a variety of cuisines and something for everyone. We had walked across Tower Bridge, visited Borough Market and then walked along the South Bank and made a day of it. I would suggest visiting at the weekend as there are fewer stalls through the week. We went back on a Tuesday as we were passing the area and there were far fewer stalls but enough to make us stop for a snack. Oh, and save room for dessert! The fudge, pastries and sweets are divine.

We found fresh produce from both local surrounds and Europe and needless to say we left with a bag full (or two) of the best cheeses, sausages, breads and fruit that very tastefully enhanced our next few meals. You can also find a great variety of local and not so local beers and wines. We just loved the bright and lively atmosphere of this market. A must see for any tourist and local alike."

We tried our best to enjoy it and sampled a wide range of food:- Shellseekers (3 scallops on a bed of stir fry beanshoots and veggies - the scallops were ok but the veggies were bland and soggy)- Parrilla Grill (Brindisa Chorizo Sandwich - dry and bland)- Ginger Pig (we ordered the chicken and mushroom pie and when we got home to reheat it we discovered it was steak and mushroom :( very dry with no gravy)- Roast to Go (pork belly & crackling sandwich with bramley apple sauce - it was ok)- La tua pasta (aubergine & courgette ravioli - tasted like a weird dumpling instead of ravioli)- Boston sausage (famous award winning sausage burger - disappointing tasted worse than our supermarket gourmet sausages back home in Melbourne)- Pate Moi (handmade organic mushroom pate - amazing and delicious. The only mind blowing food we had at Borough Market)So overall, we tried 7 stalls at Borough Market and only had one fantastic experience. We feel that we've been to much better and better priced markets in other countries."

The market is partially covered so you can even visit on rainy days.We visited shortly after opening on a Thursday and had a \u201cmarket brunch\u201d I had a Black Sausage Breakfast Bab from Rare Stra\u2019eat and my wife had a delicious pie from Pieminister as well as cold brewed coffee from a small vendor. We had delicious Macaroons from Comptoir Gourmand (so good we went back for more..) and then got a bag of dried fruits for the road.They have a great website and all the vendors at the market were very friendly with many providing samples.

The place is bigger than it seems when you first walk in - there's even a section toward the back with tables and chairs if you're not the eat-and-walk type.

You name it, they have it, and the traders I spoke to are more than happy to discuss their wares and their provenance. After a leisurely stroll along the South Bank, we stopped and picked up lunch made up from several different stalls and a delicious sangria, which we enjoyed whilst enjoying the warmth of the sun sat outside the Tate.

We decided to try a bit of everything and share. We started with a salt beef sandwich which was succulent and sublime. We drank Sangria and Pimms with the sandwich. We then spent a few hours at the Wine pantry sampling stunning English made wines.We then tried the Raclett ( hot cheese on new potatoes).What a great day out."

We were pleasantly surprised, it's a great bustling market with many fine foods and drink on offer. The place is very characterful with its Victorian architecture well preserved. Most of it is tucked underneath the railway arches and you can hear the trains moving overhead which I felt added to its charm. To me the market is a well preserved piece of old cockney London and is a treat to see."

A huge variety of market stalls selling fresh food from vegetables to Iberico Ham. Many stalls selling local British cheeses, all the cheese sellers are pleased to describe their wares and cut you off a sample. My favourite cheese seller in the market is Neals Yard, it's a proper shop, just on the fringe. The staff there are great and very knowledgable, they care about their products and are very generous with their samples. Great cheeses and you select the size you want to purchase. A very lively place, under cover, so even if the weather is bad, you'll not notice. One other thing to mention is the abundance of 'fast food' stalls, but not your typical fare. Egyptian street food, Salt beef sandwiches, Paella. It's all there and the choices are fantastic. A real 'foodie' heaven. Highly recommended!"

If nothing else, get some cheese and bread or cold meats for tea time - and make the day last even longer.

We also bought homeade prepared pasta as take out to take back to the hotel as well. We bought Pimms cups to sip while we walked and shopped. It was a Saturday afternoon and very very crowded, but it's so big, it seems you can still move around despite the crowds. This is worth a stop by."

One of our favorite things to do in London and free unless you buy something, which you will.Many kiosks of venders selling almost anything imaginable. Zebra hamburger patties? Try finding that at your Krogers.Do not miss trying the toasted cheese sandwiches. It is located over near the small church, We heard about this vendor from one of Samantha Brown's Travel shows. Definitely one of the best sandwiches we've ever had and for only 6 pounds. But low cal it is NOT!But there are many other worthy food and fruit and cheese venders as well. Too many to try.It is not open every day and a bit hard to find. It is open Thursdays. To reach it walk east along the south bank of the Thames. It is not far past the Globe Theater and a few blocks south.By the way the small church adjacent to Borough Market was William Shakespeare's boyhood church."

The best place to enjoy the street food in London . My fav is the pie shop at the beginning of the market. You must stop at the Cuban bar too. Start your day around the London Bridge and head to borough market for lunch. Remember it closes around 4pm. So if you need a hot delicious pie, you need to be there around 2pm. Cannot wait to come back again. Plenty of English bars around for some quality pale Ale :)"

Everybody should go and experience the market, but check the website first to make sure it's open when you want to go. It tends to be quieter early in the day and there's plenty to choose from for breakfast. Shop around for juice there though, and if you don't see what you want, ask the stall holders, they're generally very helpful.Pieminister is a must do for all pie lovers and the bacon, sausage and burgers from North Field Farm are tasty and filling.A foodies paradise in the shadow of the Cathedral, go and enjoy!"

It does get very busy once midday hits so if you can, know what you are going to have and join the que. You have to embrace the hustle and bustle and be prepared to wait for food and then squeeze onto a step near the beautiful church and people watch. The sky seems blue most of the time. When its raining its a bit more tricky balancing food in the inside gazebo section. Food great, good drinks and love the mixture of suits, tourists and everyone else that is lucky enough to be out in the middle of the day.

Just been reading some of the \"poor\" and \"terrible\" comments about this market and felt so incensed by the remarks, mostly from provincial visitors into London expecting to find a bargain there, that I felt I had to add my own comments!Borough market is one of the oldest food markets in London. It's not the kind of market you'd go to find 10 bargain chickens for the price of 1! This is a novelty market where you'd find top quality rare coffees, wild truffles, novelty cheeses, chocolates etc. it is expensive, hence my 4 star rating rather than 5. Think of it more as Harrod's or Selfridge's food hall, rather than Grimsby fish market! This is where you go to have kangaroo steak sandwiches, oysters and organic ciders. It does get busy, especially at lunchtimes, a testament to the variety of freshly made foods on offer. Expect to pay \u00a310-15 for a standing lunch which could range from paellas, to seafood, various hot/cold sandwiches, or more if you opt for one of the cafes or restaurants. If you're clever, you'd walk through the market, trying different dishes from around the world and get your fill for less than \u00a320. And for an extra \u00a330-40 you could take home some foods that you've never had or tried before! Alternatively, you could save yourself a lot of money by doing your shopping from your local supermarket and make yourself a pilchard sandwich for 50p!I recommend this market - give it a go and live a little. Life's too short!"

Huge variety of market foods that you can choose from. Many shops selling seafood, cheeses, sausages, fruits and produce. Our first wrap was from Applebee's. You can't miss it as it's located near the main entrance within a seafood restaurant. Their cajun prawn and fish wrap was fantastic. At 5 pounds each, I'd say it was a good buy. Wrap was loaded with fresh fish and prawns. So good we went back just for it. Another favourite was the duck confit sandwich. Duck was crispy and fragrant. Finally, do not miss the roast hog roll situated at the left of the market. Head all the way in and you should see a stretch of stalls after the restaurants. There was a long queue for this (not surprising). Roll came stuffed with generous serving of roast pork. Fantastic. Much to our disappointment, the stall was replaced by another the following Saturday. Note: Only go on Wednesday to Saturday because that's when the full market is available. Make sure you head to Borough Market at least twice because some stalls do get swapped! The market is right outside London Bridge train station."

The fresh fruit and veg stalls had things on that we had never seen before and the cheese stalls were all giving samples away absolutely yummy.

I had a vegetarian pot of chickpeas and veggies for \u00a34.50 which was flavoursome and to die for. I ended my week with a lovely apple muffin for \u00a31.90 from Karaway Bakery stall. If you like great, freshly made bakery items you will not be disappointed.My colleagues rave about the freshly cooked fish and chips from Fish which may be worth a try too.You literally could eat your way around the market dining cheaply and healthy.

We have done them all over the world, and although this is no Boqueria, it is terrific. We went here on our last day in London and should have gone here first. The market is burdgeoning with food stalls, restaurants, food stuffs to buy, drinks, etc. Don't miss the truffle stall. I was so busy soaking in the atmosphere that I am afraid to say, I did not make mental notes of the particular stalls that I purchased different nibbles from. There was one lady that had pitchers of Sangria for 3 euro a glass, close to the front of the market, and I will say, I highly recommend a cup of her red sangria while browsing the market. There was another stall toward the center, right next to the interesting sign about rents, that sold different kinds of burgers. We had the lamb/mint burger, which I am afraid I cannot recommend. The burger was dry and small and so was the bun. The man did give us a sample of his \"salted beef\", which in the US we call corned beef, and that was very good. There was an attached green market that had beautiful produce and toward the back several interesting restaurants that we didn't find, unfortunately, until we were already full. The underground has a stop right there so it is very convenient. We had walked over from something else, so when we were ready to go back on the underground I asked the information fellow which way to the underground, he came around his desk and walked us to the stop. He really could have pointed, it was that close, but I thought it was cute. This market has something for every foodie, I highly recommend it."

It was about a 20 minute walk to Borough Market, across London Bridge on the south bank. We arrived around 4:00PM and there was lots of activity. It was a Thursday, so the \"full market\" was open until 5:00PM. (Check the Borough Market website for days and hours when they are open. Everything is not open every day.) We went because we had heard about the great food being served by various vendors. Specifically, we were looking for raclettes at the stand operated by Kappacasein Dairy. These are a serving of new potatoes smothered in Ogleshield cheese, topped with spicy gerkins and pearl onions. Cost was \u00a36.00. Decadent and delicious. We wandered around and also bought a great grilled bratwurst (\u00a34.50) from the German Deli. We finished with dessert from tables operated by Artisan Foods....a piece of German cheesecake and a piece of hazelnut carrot cake. Both were delicious (but the hazelnut carrot cake was better)! As they were shutting down for the day, and packing away all their baked goods, we got them both at a discounted price of \u00a33.00.Besides all the food booths, there were butchers, bakers, florists and lots other shops & stalls. It's an interesting market to visit....and a great place to stop for a delicious bite to eat."

I grabbed a smoothie and started walking past each stand to check out all the different kinds of food. While i was trying to figure out what i wanted for lunch, i got pretty full on just the samples that were offered from each vendor. My memory is a little hazy as its been about 8 months since I was actually in London, but I wanted to give it a TA review anyway! In a nutshell, friendly vendors, lots of samples (cheeses, breads, meats, dips, olives, veggies, fruits, the list goes on and on), delicious foods, an overall fun experience! After stuffing myself with samples, i finally bought some curry chicken and rice that was being cooked right in front of everyone in a giant cauldron. It was a massive portion that i didn't finish, reasonably priced, and quite yummy! If you have some time to wander thru here to hunt for some good food definitely stop by!"

The Saturday crowds at Borough Market can get to where you can do little but shuffle along like penguins but it is easy to understand the draw for this legendary culinary madhouse. The individual purveyors of cheeses, meats, fishes etc are cheek by jowl with all manner of stands offering fresh-made, fresh-grilled food. But before trying anything else, you must join the queue for one of Kappacasein's famous 3-cheese toasties. (6 pounds in May 2015). Arguably, this is the finest single item in London. I am serious."

Clever sitting area for when you need to rest your feet, but you might have to wait for a space. Samples to try before you buy. Well worth a visit.

We walked out with some of the best cheese and bread which only made it to the church next to the market for a little impromptu picnic followed by delicious goat ice-cream.

I've never seen so many different cultures gathered harmoniously (and deliciously) in one single area before. You can buy and try food literally from all around the world and be fascinated by all these flavours and aromas that come from every single stand. I was extremely amazed by the Greek olive oil, the handmade Italian pasta and the Ethiopian street food. The best day to visit is of course Saturday in terms of variety, but it is advisable to go as early as possible because it gets really crowded in the afternoon. In case you decide to go on a weekday you really need to check online for the timetable, as there are days that the market half-opened. Nevertheless, it is definitely a place that international cuisines meet and form a really joyful atmosphere and it surely worth one (at least) visit."

I'm am American studying abroad in London and I've been here so far for six months and I highly highly recommend visiting Borough Market for every age range and price range! The street food is about as cheap as you could possibly buy something in London for (think 5-7 pounds for a filling meal), so it's great if you're on a budget, but it's also delicious, fresh, cleanly and good quality! Hopping and lively during the day, be sure to check the hours you go but the best days and times to visit are morning/ lunch time on Friday and Saturdays, this is when the full market is open. Sundays unfortunately the market is closed so save something else (like Camden Lock Market) for a Sunday trip if you're in London for a weekend or week. The market also offers great desserts and other specialities, like beautiful cheeses, breads, cured meats, oysters, fresh fish, and fresh fruits and vegetables. LOVE! Options for everyone's preferences and requirements, as a vegetarian I have had tons of options but so have my meat-eating friends, also includes several gluten-free stands :)"

Go early or go another day. Try to avoid lunchtime - although that rather spoils the point of going! But if you are OK with crowds, happy to be dragged hither and yon with the flow, you'll be fine.Tip two - take lots of cash. Get it out of the ATM BEFORE you get there. The local ATMs will have a queue a mile long with people who didn't bring enough and have spent what they did.Tip three - don't buy the first thing you see. Wander around. The variety is tremendous. You will see fresh fruit, vegetables, mushrooms, fish you've only read about in cookery books or seen on fine dining TV programmes. Razor clams, samphire, chanterelles, they were all there last visit.Tip four - take a big shopping bag or a rucksack. You will buy a lot. You will spend all your money. Despite tip 2, you WILL be queuing at the ATM.You will love it - it's brilliant. I have seen the surrounding area revived by the success of the market. Buy a traditional pork pie - or have oysters and a glass of white wine. Buy some fantastic finochiona salami. Just enjoy.So why not 5 stars? I guess because it is a victim of its own success, it's too crowded, and it's too expensive. But what the hell - if you like food, you'll love it."

There are some full time venues, but the majority of the most colorful stalls are only open Wednesday through Saturday and Saturday is definitely the main event. The market is jammed. Locals go to hit their favorite stalls for the week's marketing. Tourists wander around delightedly sipping Prosecco, Pims, coffee, or fresh organic juices; nibbling on enticing samples from the vendors; and noshing down an exotic meal or typical British lunch from a take away container while perching on a wall in the Southwark Cathedral churchyard, or just leaning against a pillar or sitting on the curb. It's shoulder-to-shoulder and the pedestrian traffic jam is exacerbated by all the photo taking and general consternation as people try to figure out how to navigate the labyrinth of pathways between the stalls. It is absolutely all great fun and great food and great atmosphere, but you must have patience for crowds (well mannered and multinational). There's no better way to spend a Saturday morning/early afternoon in London. You will really feel you are part of the city! If you want to avoid the crowds, go late Friday afternoon and you will have a much more leisurely experience and you can appreciate the atmosphere and architecture of one of the oldest markets in London. Or visit both Friday and Saturday and see both sides!"

When we first arrived, some of the vendors were still getting set up (I wasn't kidding when I said it was early), but most of them were up and ready to sell. Our first pass through the market was just to get our bearings, and see what was on offer. On our second pass, we started making purchases. Coffee from this vendor for him, a chai latte from this vendor for me. Then, on our next pass, we started paying particular attention to the food stalls (of which there are many many much).I was impressed by the sheer variety of foods and food stuffs available. You could get anything from freshly baked breads to Thai street food, freshly-squeezed organic juices to paella, goat cheese, milks and ice creams to macarons, oils and sauces to fruits and granolas. It was a food-lover's paradise, and it was hard to choose.But, eventually, choose we did. We made ourselves a little breakfast and then continued our walk around the market. It didn't take long to see everything there was to see, but I did enjoy taking in the different scents along the way. I so wish we had something like this in my neck of the woods. It reminded me of Chelsea Market in New York, but outdoors and a lot less crowded. If we had something like this near us, I'd be a frequent shopper. I wish we had had more time to spend there!"

We found this place entirely through trip advisor when we were looking for local markets - similar to what you would find in Barcelona or Rome or Lisbon - and the reviews pointed to this being as delightful as anywhere else.We headed over to the Market from the Shard, a mere 5 min walk, and as soon as you enter the energy of the place, the diversity of food on offer and the aroma through the market grips all senses. My wife and I quite literally went a little cuckoo with all that we could stuff our faces with. We went for Ethiopian beef, pulled pork and pints of London Lager on outpr first day.After deciding that just one trip to the market doesn't do it justice, we returned the following day - our last in London - to sample more. This time ww opted for Vietnamese Chicken Curry, Scottish. venison Burgers and a BBQ Beef Wrap.I think it's safe to say that this market will form a must-do on our future trips to London.A word of advise to first time visitors - whilst its difficult not to get carried away, have a look around the whole place before deciding what to have for your meal(s) - the choice is baffling and its hard not top opt for the first station you see!A must visit."

A lot of vendors and way too much to choose from because everything sounded delicious. One of my 14-year-old-boys had a kangaroo burger from the exotic meat booth. We also tried the Vietnamese Chicken Curry, homemade gnocchi with pesto, smoothies and ice cream from The Greedy Goat.

It was around spring last year, I remember the Cherry Tree was in full bloom in the near by church yard. So many stalls selling so many different types of food and spices, perfect for any foodies out there. It was quite cold so we treated ourselves to a hot pie and mash each, served in a cardboard box with gravy! You would think that gravy in a box would be a recipe for disaster but no . . . it works and it was absolutly perfect for a cold day. Well worth a trip, the fish stalls are a must see."

Me and my friends got a burger and fries from one of the food stands and it was delicious followed by a brownie which I have to say was scrumptious. It's a credit to london.

Everything looks amazing and all credit to the market organisers for ensuring the quality is so high it is just a shame that everything is so expensive. We managed to spend \u00a3100 and came away with just a few bags of goodies. We have been given a tip off that there is a better value offering nearby but I am going to keep this a secret as the food on offer is apparently just as good but half the price."

I believe it operates Thursday to Saturday. Saturday being the busiest day. Make a morning out of it and go see what Londoners eat. While you are at it, have breakfast there at one of the many restaurants surrounding the market or in the market. You can get a coffee and a \"bap\" (bacon in a bun) pretty cheap. Interesting way to spend a Saturday morning and get to know the London Bridge area. Highly recommend it."

I don't believe that any will share the history and quality of Borough though. I won't delve into the history of this place, there are plenty of websites that do that. I will say that you should be prepared for some serious decision making on what to eat. This is more of a market selling hot meals and snacks to be eaten there and then, rather a market of 'ingredients' to be taken home and enjoyed (although there is some of the latter). There is no point me listing examples of what on offer as I can't think of any cuisine that wasn't available. My wife had a salt beef, pickle and mustard roll that was still talked about weeks later, it was that good! I should have joined her, but opted for the salt and chilli squid instead which was still delicious. It's worth noting that this place can get extremely busy. We were there on a Saturday during the lunch period. I think this may have been the most crowded I've ever experienced, so be warned to avoid peak eating times if you don't like crowds. It's attractions like this that make us wish we lived in London full time. We can't wait to come back!"

It is an easy tube ride to London Bridge station which can be accessible via the Jubilee Line or Northern Line. If you take the tube, when arriving at the London Bridge station, look for the signs that point you to the \"way out\" and pay attention for the \"borough market\" exit. Once you exit onto the street, you cross the road, walk 30 seconds down and you will reach the steps that will take you down to the market.We have been to outdoor markets in Madrid, Barcelona, Nice, Florence, and many more and I must admit the Borough Market held it's own. No need to plan on where to eat if you visit as there is plenty to eat when there. The booths range from herbal organic tea, to sourdough breads with olives, to venison burgers, to imported cheeses. There was a wine tasting shop, olive pots where you can take olives to go, freshly made doughnuts filled with caramel, focaccia, even a stand preparing espresso and cappuccinos. The market opens at 10am and closes at 5pm. Without exaggerating, you can comfortably have breakfast, lunch, and an early dinner there if you wish. Just be mindful you are outdoors so you are exposed to the elements. Seating might be an issue as well but if you don't care about standing in a corner somewhere eating a plate of tapas, then it's all good.If you are planning an itinerary, be mindful the market is close to The Shard, Tower of London, and Tower Bridge. It is a bit of walking though but well worth the adventure. Enjoy!"

Borough Market has almost legendary status now, but in the past it was a local food market which attracted Londoners from miles around in much the same way as Billingsgate or Smithfield. Today, it is a bit of a tourist trap which thrives off its' past history. That said, it is still worth a visit and there are some very interesting stalls to purchase from. Personally, I would avoid the hot food stalls towards the river end of the market, you can do far better for more authentic food elsewhere and pay a fraction of the price. Some of the confectionery stalls are also probably best avoided, in particular those selling Macarons. When you have Laduree and others within a shot tube journey you will get infinitely better quality for similar prices.I did say there are some good purchases to be had, and I would look very closely at some stalls, because you can find some real foodie gems. I'll leave it for you to find them, as you would do the market a disservice if you just went to see a small selection of stalls. Please take time to have a good look around, the market is in a few bits and there is a fruit & veg stall which is set out to perfection.TIP- If you are a bit squeamish, or any of your party are, best avoid the butchery section as there are some sights those more sensitive might find a little upsetting.Over all, the market is a truly fascinating place, once you get away from the bits which are, in my opinion, over priced and aimed purely at relieving visitors of their money in exchange for poor quality there are great sights, and even greater people to chat with."

There has been a market in this area probably for over one thousand years ago now, the first one being at the end of the then London Bridge.The current market is located to the immediate South of Southwark Cathedral but the tourist/traveller should beware as you are not really seeing an authentic historic London retail market but somewhere that has mainly developed only in the last couple of decades to cater mainly for the 'foodies' among us. It was mainly just the wholesale market until then.What's on offer here is a wonderful selection of different foods from around the world, both in the general market area and in some of the small, busy streets around. There is always plenty of 'street food' on sale and I think you could grow fat here just from availing yourselves of the many free samples.The market has been under threat in the past from the growing railway infrastructure, and trains above rumble over the viaducts at regular intervals.One of the nicest buildings is part of the old Floral Hall which once stood alongside the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden.Be aware that the retail market only operates from Wednesday to Saturday, and Saturdays can become unbearably overcrowded."

Great quality of all that you can wish for. My personal favourites are the Khanom Krok (Thai coconut pancake) stand (They are bite size of pure delight) and cheese sampling with a glass of red wine! Get there a little early (around 10-11am) to avoid the crowds. You will get to enjoy the market at your leisure (preferably with a glass of Proseco ;0)"

If you're lucky, you'll run into two blokes selling Turkish Boreks - cheese stuffed filo pastries - that is comfort food at its warm, crispy, cheesy best!\"Free From Bakehouse\" also has a stall here, and they sell a variety of gluten-free and sugar-free cakes and desserts, which are all definitely worth a try. Had one of their moist dark chocolate cake slices when I was last there and I was simply blown away that the cake had no refined sugars in it!The only downside of Borough Market, I reckon, is that there's just too much food to try out there!

I saw lots of lines moving very slowly because people were trying to line up a perfect shot of their food at the exact moment of purchase. Extremely annoying!

From the sheer variety of produce on sale, to the fab setting (the walk along the river to reach it is quite something in its own right), it is a sight not to be missed. The venue is home to many street food vendors of various cuisines and dietary habits but it also has a fair amount of restaurants around, if you prefer to sit down. It also provides for ample people watching and photo opportunities, if you are not hungry (but you would be seriously missing out)."

They have stalls of everything - from food from around the world to pastries, cakes, coffee, smoothies etc. If you're around that part of London stop by for lunch or dinner (or just a dessert) - it's worth it!"

At that time, Gregg Wallace was serving on one of the fruit stalls and the produce and stalls were worth visiting. We returned in january, and it was raining and dank, but a lot of the stalls were closed and the others were very overpriced. We didn't eat at the street food stalls but they were busy. Nice architecture and worth visiting if in the area but i do think it has gone downhill."

I took young Barnaby to see the market where I used to go when at Godson's Brewery, the Globe pub is still there but it was not open as it used to be during the day. What can I say, We used to go to Fish and it is still there, the market has a plethora of food stores and cheese stalls and cafes and restaurants, the atmosphere is amazing, the buzz and crowds, just like the market used to be just with people wearing more expensive clothes. We started off at Brindisa, having breakfast in our favourite Spanish cafe. Later. we could not resist a salt beef sandwich with a wally, salt beef sandwiches without a gherkin are not the real deal, but Barnaby was resistant so I ate his. It took me back to the East End. This is the best market in London that anyone can access without a special pass or tour. It's vibrant and fun and has something for everyone. I buy my meat from a shop opposite Smithfield but the food stalls and butchers here look great. Barnaby loved his slice of contemporary London and he thought the salt beef sandwich was delicious, too. When Michael Fitzalan was planning his best selling book, Remember the Fifth of November, he took us to Brindisi and up to The View at the Shard. It was a summer's day and Brindisa Borough Market was bathed in sunshine, the lunch was superb, sherry and tapas, then we went up the Shard to view London. We bought and took home some cheese from one stall and some salami from another. I am determined to work my way around all the eateries and end up at Fish, which we went to about two years ago. Wish me luck, it may take me twenty years to do it, but the variety and quality of food will sustain me! This place is the ideal first call on a day in London, or for lunch or for supper, or for an eleven o' clock salt beef sandwich form the sandwich stall underneath the arches, but don't forget the wally!"

If I lived near-by I would probably never have to cook again. We went on a Saturday morning and it was getting pretty busy by the time we left, but hey, that's just part of the atmosphere."

It's a good place to browse and there is a wide variety of food to sell (unfortunately I couldn't buy much because I had to walk around London for the rest of the day). There are lot's of samples on offer and some of the things that I tried were delicious. I would definitely go back when I am in a better position to shop."

We could taste many things and walk around easily about 1 hr. At 11am the place became very very crowded. The places that sale food or drinks were full with people. Although we waited in a long line, We bought a very tasty German \"brotvursht\" (like Hot Dog but much more better) and enjoyed every bite. Hot Apricot sider on that cold day was worming. If in the area - it's worth the visit."

It is definitely way more 'touristy', or maybe it has always been like that but I felt it even more because I went on a Saturday. Word of caution - if you don't like crowds, then doing on Saturday is not the best time for you! If you quite like the buzzing atmosphere and queues, then it's still a great place. Amazing selection of food and drink as expected - tons of cheeses, bread, chutneys, meat, fruit juice, vegetables and everything in between! For a foodie like me, it was overwhelming and I got excited at every stall. Hahahaha. As i mentioned, it's just the crowds that made things a bit complicated because it got quite hard to navigate around sometimes! I must admit though, prices aren't the best - maybe because it has become so popular with tourists that they can afford to jack up their prices. A small brownie or piece of bread easily costs \u00a32, which may sound not too bad but considering that it's just a stall out in the open, some might hesitate to pay this price.Nevertheless, take your time exploring and sampling the food - it's a great place to spend an hour or two just admiring the huge array of food! Check out the surrounding cafes too - I've heard a lot of positive things about them as well!"

You will really discover amazing things produced by people who actually care about their products. The food options really are limitless. Before you go, bring several things. First bring water. Second, bring utensils, perhaps something more functional than any flimsy plastic fork etc. that you can pick up from the market vendors. Really, try cutting into a wedge of cheese with a plastic fork. Pack a few napkins or paper towels because things can get messy. Also you can wet one with your drinking water. Why? Because you may find that you want a piece of fruit or something that you need to wipe off before you eat it. Fourth bring an open mind. If the vendor isn't busy, definitely talk to them. They will talk your ear off telling you about their products. Also don't forget some of the shops on the side streets like Neal's Yard Dairy, Konditor & Cook, and Monmouth coffee for example."

Located just steps from London Bridge Tube, so easily accessible from the centre of the city, this is one of the oldest and best-known markets in London. We visited Saturday lunchtime, so the market was busy with a friendly mixture of tourists, and Londoners from every background. We started our visit at Spice Mountain, where we picked up some tubs of prepared curry powders (from a huge selection) and a bottle of delicious Pomegranite molasses. We then went about our mission to explore and try as many unfamiliar foods as possible. Next was a stall selling flavoured mustards, and a Croatian stall with delicious fig preserves. Artisan bread and cheeses are big here, and it takes real willpower not to walk away with a bag full of sourdough loaves, or a creation stuffed with olives and herbs. We discovered some delicious mushroom pate, and bought two tubs for \u00a38, and washed-down the sample with some delicate white tea. Now it was time for lunch! We started with a box of mixed vegetable curries (perfectly spiced) from Gujurati Rasoi, shared under the arches whilst sheltering from the rain. We then discovered Gourmet Goat, and shared a Kid Goat Kofta, served with Tzatziki, heaps of herbs and fresh lemon juice. A gorgeous, melt-in-the-mouth treat. Still hungry (it was a cold winter day after all) we then sampled 36 month cheese, and salami with pistachios, before concluding lunch with a plate of Paella, topped with mussels and prawns. Borough Market is not all about gourmet food; there is fresh veg aplenty, including varieties you may find difficult to source elsewhere, such as fresh Galangal. Prices are generally relatively expensive. We picked-up some Thai Basil just before we left. We spent about 1.5 - 2 hours here on this visit; we could have happily lingered longer. If you love food, you really can't visit London without spending a little time here."

I cant get all my oils, fish, meat, spices, veg etc. Great quality, if slightly pricey. As a tourist come and hang out at the market, eat drink and be merry, then walk it off down the South Bank. My top tip though...go Friday morning when it's open and no one is there."

The Market itself can get quite crowded so I recommend heading there in the morning for a good look at the stalls before it gets busy (we went on a Thursday), and then head back there for the lunch time rush, or if your keen go for the crowds at lunchtime. The stalls are incredible, there is amazing fruit and veggies (was very disappointed that we didn't have a kitchen in our hotel otherwise I would have cooked up a storm), the sourdough is great and only 2 pound 50p for a delicious loaf, the fish and poultry looked amazing and I recommend a juice from the juice stall (not the pre made one, there is a stall just around from that who makes them on the spot). On our return I tried the potato/cheesy thing that I cant remember the name of... should have probably gone for the paella, took about 15 min to line up and get lunch, but that is tourists, work crowd and just a whole lot of people. I also recommend getting some cheesecake and a giant cookie! would defiantly visit again!"

The Italian owners were really friendly took an interest in what we really would like and provided us with some fantastic liquorice.I think the best way to appreciate this market is to go with a few key recipes / unusual ingredients in mind then shop - rather than just wander around aimlessly - although I appreciate wandering can prompt thoughts of recipes and tourists also spend money on lunch etc. A great place to visit when in London. I must recommend it to visiting friends in future."

Take a stroll and let your nose lead you as ethiopian cooking aromas take over from where the sizzling hog-roast just got you drooling. Yes, you can walk around and taste a bit of most things, and you'll be tempted by many others, so good to stroll once around before you chose - don't forget there are two bits, the main part is to the south of the smaller triangle of stalls near to the Cathedral.I have to say that I found the prices were on the higher side of average, but you have everything here in one place to amaze your guests with that something a little different, or to just indulge your taste buds... very well worth a visit just to see and smell it all !"

The market itself can get very packed, I usually avoid Saturdays and lunch hours if I can.

It is easily accessible by tube (Jubilee Line) so no hassles getting here whatsoever. Unlike some of the other markets, the quality of products is good but be prepared for queues. Everything looks scrumptious and unusual. The market itself is not very large but the selection is still quite extensive. You can walk along the river and see the other interesting places in this colorful part of London."

I have made a trip to Borough Market the last 2 times I've been to London and I never get bored of it. There are so many shops that sell cheeses, dried and cured meats, jams, olive oils, bread, fresh seafood (and oysters!) etc. It's really overwhelming. I would suggest coming early on a Saturday when it isn't too crowded. Nevertheless, here are a few of my favourite stalls:La Tua Fresh Pasta - delicious and affordable fresh pastas to have on the spot or to go.The Olive Oil Company - quality olive oils (many that are new harvest ones) and balsamic vinegars and good prices.Tea2You - Amazing quality teas at affordable prices. The star teas are the Darjeeling first and second flushes. You'll be impressed!The Parma Ham and Mozzarella Stand - Quality Mozzarellas, Burratas and parma hams!Spice Mountain - The people here really know their spices. There are literally a hundred over different spices and blends you can get. Prices are also reasonable. We bought the real Ceylon Cinnamon sticks and Saffrons. There's also this shop that sells all types of flavoured mustards. Try the truffle mustard!There are so many other amazing stalls with passionate people who run them that I don't think you will not be able to find what you like. What's more, you can taste the food before you buy them! Afterwards, you could just head over to Geletaria 3Bis (just 1 minute away) for one of the best Gelatos in London!"

I've lived in London for over 40 years and seen Borough Market change from a traditional wholesale fruit and veg market to what is today. A real touristy place, with prices to match! The stall holders near the steps from the bridge seem to charge 25% more for their takeaway food than those inside the market proper. But it is a fun place to visit. The choice of European meats, cheeses, olives, olive oils, breads etc is fantastic. I saw a couple of traditional English fruit and veg stalls, selling locally grown produce (local to the growers - not London!). There is a traditional cafe in the middle of the market (Maria's Market cafe) which is good for a basic fry-up and tea or coffee (nescafe) for under \u00a310 for two. There also is a good choice of sit in restaurants around the outside. A good place to go if you wanted different ingredients for a special meal!"

Theres not a lot of traditional British food here, lots of spanish ingredients which are ten times the price they are in spain, French cheeses- good range but you pay. Organic meat and organic veg are great quality so i go for that. The Turkish store with the mezze plate and bread for 5 pounds is the best value lunch deal cos they have tables too and nice view of street - beautiful range of olives and home made turkish delight there too. theres Ethiopian, middle eastern, oysters, pulled pork buns, roast in a roll and stuff like that for around 6 quid for lunch.Elliots Cafe is one of the best restaurants in London. Simple bistro but wonderful food combinations, reasonable prices and lots of chefs eat here Im told!Go early in the week and early in the day at the weekend- otherwise its too hectic"

A very beautiful and authentic market which is easy to find, near London Bridge station, Borough station or just find Southwark Cathedral South of the River. Best coming here for food from the market stalls around or before lunchtime to avoid the crowd. I love Borough market for the food, the display of colours and array of fresh products from awesome cheese to olive oil, bread, cakes, meat , fish or spices ... You will find everything exciting (except the crowd perhaps) . Take your camera, a Fiver will get you a kangaroo burger cooked on the spot, I love the Balkan borek and the spanish Tapas - However, I never made it to Montmouth coffee ... still queue outside . 1 x Paddington Bear spotted there, opposite Montmouth cafe. (Bread section ) the doughnut with vanilla cream at \u00a3 2.50 is a bit of a rip off but to die for ! Praline not bad ...I 'll stick to my crunchy baguette with green olives at \u00a32.00.Toilets are located in the Market Hall, that's where all the glass window panels are from the street view and the space looks like a hot house with red tinsels are hanging down, flying in the breeze. It's also where you can find information about the market itself : map / Plan/ general information. It's often difficult to find space in cafes, so walk about out and around the market, there are various places to sit down for a cuppa and further down on Borough High street towards Elephant, 5mn walk away on the left there is a small north african cafe which has delicious food and mint tea , much more quiet and prices suddenly more reasonable than inside the market !"

There are various countries represented, with many wonderful choices of meats, cheeses, breads etc, and it all is presented in a friendly atmosphere and even has a newish covered atrium with seating so you can enjoy the many take away choices on hand.

This is one of my all time favourite places to visit in London and one of the best food markets, I have visited many times, especially as I used to work nearby. There are some excellent stalls and if looking for something to eat, try the street food, plenty of choice and options rather than the sit down restaurants in the area, which are expensive and typically overpriced in my opinion, even for London. You need to plan your visit as on some days you won't get the full market, with many of the outlets shut. End of the week and weekends are popular but very busy, if you are not eating get there early or when the lunchtime crowd are not there."

As well as the plethora of stalls, there are many restaurants surrounding the market and also bakeries, Monmouth Coffee which is hard to surpass and will gladly offer advice and tastings.

Borough Market is only open on Wednesdays to Saturdays. Visit its website boroughmarket.org.uk for the opening hours. It can get quite crowded especially on Saturdays. To beat the Saturday crowd, best reach there by 8am as soon as it opens. We made it a point to be there at 8am on a Saturday to grab some breakfast, and had the place literally to ourselves! It was very pleasant, moving from stall to stall checking everything out. Even the seats at a corner of the market were mostly unoccupied, meaning that we could sit and eat in leisure.If time is limited, you can use the interactive Market Map on the website to better plan your visit by shortlisting the stalls/ shops you must visit.There is also a line of stalls cooking/selling Asian cuisines. We tried the Chinese Noodles served in a box and it was delicious! Everything really looked so good..from the cakes and pastries to the paella and steaks/burgers...Do go if you've the chance!

There are two sections, one with more of grocery area, and the other part has the food stalls where you can get any cuisine that you like ranging from pad thai and curry to corned beef. Worth going back multiple times so you can try all the different types of fresh food, baked goods and hand pressed juices! Delicious!"

I bought a carrot cake which costed \u00a32.20, i gave her a \u00a350 note and she just gave me \u00a37.80 for the change. She insisted that is a \u00a310 note instead of \u00a350 and denied to show me the note I gave her. I am very upset and I am shocked this happened at one of the famous markets in the world. This totally affects the image of borough market. As a tourist, I feel not safe to go to borough market again."

We always managed to find new gems in this market and its surroundings each time we went, from the freshly shucked oysters to the wild game burgers and the very best coffee - Monmouth coffee on the outer edge of the market. The fresh produce section was also an eye-opener, with sample tastings of cured meat, parma ham and delectable cheese available for purchase. Great variety of cooked food from wild game burgers to steaming paella and the traditional fish and chips. Pleasant atmosphere overall. I do suggest walking through the entire complex before deciding to which food to purchase as there may be multiple stores offering the same kind of food."

You may also recognise scenes from Entrapment, Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban and many other films / movies.Try to visit Friday morning (10 to 12) or Saturday (8 to 11) to see the market at its best, but avoid Saturday from mid-day as the crowds just spoil the whole experience."

But that is just the start having bought a local burgher (a must) off you go on a walk by the river where you will see looking back the Tower of London and Tower bridge and you are underneath the magnificent Shard. You pass the Clink Museum where you can see how unfortunates were kept in chains for misdemeanors years ago, then there is the Golden Hind a perfect replica of the ship Francis Drake sailed in, onwards to the Globe the perfect reconstruction of Shakespeare's theatre, next the Tate Modern the most visited art gallery in the world (with a small diversion you can cross the 'wobbly' bridge and see St Paul's Cathedral). Then on again passing all sorts of street entertainers and you will pass the National Theatre, The British Film Institute, The Royal Festival Hall, the London Aquarium, The London Eye, from where yoiu can see the Houses of Parliament, cross Westminster Bridge and you have Westminster Abbey and a little further Buckingham Palace, then back on yourself to Trafalgar Square, and of course Covent garden.

There is a huge selection of cheeses, breads, meats, pastries and more available to buy. If you are travelling abroad some stalls even offer to vacuum pack the goods. We like to buy 3-4 loaves of the artisan bread and freeze it at home to last us until our next visit. On my last visit, between our family of four we had fresh pasta, an ostrich burger, organic vegatable soup and a fish paella for lunch. All of it was great and if we has space to try any more of the foods on offer we would have!"

Take your time, wander and don't be afraid to ask to try something. Thoroughly recommend all UK produce especially UK Charcuterie. Cheeses also are divine. Of course it is all personal taste. The Breas which is from the Artisan Bakery there (where they also run Baking classes) is amazing and not too expensive. Worth taking a loaf, cakes or whatever takes your fancy home. Look for the stalls selling Pies, Sausage Rolls and Scotch Eggs, especially the ones with Quail Eggs. Fruit and Veg, all so attractively displayed with many exotic varieties. Must not forget the Fish with fabulous Oysters to knock back!Do eat early from the many Stalls selling food, don't dither as by 1.00 p.m. the queues are forming fast. Be aware also there are few places to perch to eat apart from the grounds of Southwark Cathedral. All in all an experience but be aware prices are high!"

All the stall owners are helpful and take the time to explain their wares (and are usually happy to let you taste a sample). The Market gets very crowded on Saturdays, so I suggest you go early or, alternatively, try Fridays which are less frenetic. Borough Market is easy to reach on the Underground (London Bridge Station). It is definitely a London gem!"

It's a traditional style market selling meat, fish, veg etc but also packed with new and different foody products to buy and try. Go hungry and take plenty of people to help you carry everything you'll want to buy! Lots of traditional pubs nearby too."

In fact, this was our 3rd time to visit and while things had moved around a bit, it did not disappoint. It's so much fun to wander around the stalls filled with fresh baked breads, cookies and candies. Not to mention the cheeses and the sausages, the jellies and juices, the nuts and paellas steaming in huge vats. Oh and the chocolate in all flavors shapes and sizes. This place is a foodies delight. Can't wait until our next visit. The full market is open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. There are some permanent stalls that are open on other days of the week."

There was a stall selling Prosecco and Kir Royales by the glass, paella pots sizzling away, gooey fresh mozzarella cheeses and spices from all round the world.

Alas, Shakespeare probably didn't have the benefit of the Borough Market. If he had been able to shop there, he might have spent more time eating and less time writing.

I can see how this place is wonderful if you live locally or are staying nearby. We were there at around 10:30am on a Thursday morning. It was busy but not crowded. We had a stroller with us for our four-year-old, which was okay to push around. Between us, we bought some fudge, cakes, ice-cream and hot roast rolls for immediate consumption. We couldn\u2019t really buy much ahead for dinner as we would have had to carry it sightseeing with us all day. I did wonder about some of the vendors\u2019 hygiene in wearing gloves but then handling food and money in the same gloved hand. We had trouble finding something plain and healthy to suit our four-year-old son for lunch.There are lots of other things worth seeing in the London Bridge tube station area (The Shard, Tower Bridge, Southwark Cathedral, Golden Hinde, Tate Modern ) which could be worth combining with a quick look at the Borough Markets, but I wouldn\u2019t identify the markets as a \u201cmust see\u201d tourist destination in its own right.

It is much more up-market (excuse the pun) with French, Italian, Spanish outlets as well as fresh cakes, wide variety of cheese, pate etc., etc., Also, there are many tasters for people to enjoy as they walk around the market.The market also has quality plants for sale and is flanked by bars, cafes and restaurants.People can also purchase and enjoy hot food - freshly prepared - from all over the world. There is something for everyone from English to Indian food.I visited on a Thursday just after mid-day and it was bustling and certainly a lively tourist area. There were even stalls selling Borough Market items. A good couple of hours can be spent in and around this market especially as it is undercover - so perfect for a rainy day visit."

You'll find some interesting, obscure buts and pieces here but on picking when to visit, choose carefully. It can be so busy that you just don't get to enjoy it. Here are my top tips:-1/ get there at about 4.45. Yes, it's later but there will be far fewer people about, so you'll get to see more of it.2/ visit Neals Yard cheese shop. You'll love it!3/ grab a glass of something unusual at The Wine Pantry.4/ go and have a look around the Paul Smith shop. It's like stepping back in time by 50 years. Wonderful!5/ visit Borough Kitchen, just too cool for school.6/ taste, taste and more taste. The key to Borough Market is the opportunity to sample all the delicious wares on offer.7/ if you have any room left, finish off with something to eat at any of the number of great little eateries dotted around the market.Have a wonderful time!"

Borough food market has a somewhat overwhelming choice of food stalls to choose from, you can buy everything from speciality cheeses, craft beers, meat, fruit and vegetables to german sausages freshly prepared, indian dishes, burgers, cakes you name it. The market has been discovered by every guide book available to mankind and is crowded with tourists and office workers alike, so suffers from overcrowding and having bought your food the hunt is on for a place to sit - there are benches but too few and in a somewhat un-alluring corner of the market. Hygiene-wise things look OK, but as always with these markets things are a little haphazard and leave a little to be desired at times (ie handling food and money at the same time).Having said that I\u00b4ve been there a few times now and never been unwell, it\u00b4s well worth a visit and there are some really unusual things to eat. If you prefer your lunch sitting down at a table then go just to look and buy food to eat later."

There were lots of vendors of cheese, sausage, fudge, etc. who were very generous with samples of their delicious wares. It was a wonderful experience to have all these taste tests. The toughest decision was making a choice of what to have for lunch as there were so many choices. We noted line ups at most of them testifying to the quality as there appeared to be many local business people buying their lunch here. This is a terrific place just to wander around in the somewhat festive atmosphere where you can spend a short time or a few hours. Don't miss it when you are on the Southbank."

There is so much to see, taste, and feast on. Your senses are overwhelmed from the moment you walk in. It's great for both tourists and locals. If your in a hotel you can eat at the market or take lots of exquisite 'pickey' foods back to your room - no kitchen necessary. The market is surrounded by great pubs and there are stalls inside selling seasonal drinks. You get a real sense of London's history at Borough Market, even with all of the modern stalls it still feels like a thriving epicentre of gastronomic delight which feeds hungry locals with fresh quality produce.Visiting the market is a quintessential London experience. One of the best parts of the experience is talking to the stall holders about their food. They will always take the time to tell you about where the food came from, their tips, and they love to share a secret or two about the best thing they have to offer.Best time to visit the market on a Saturday is just after opening or just before closing. The crowds are at their lowest just after opening. You can grab a coffee from one of the great cafes surrounding the market and then browse through the stalls to you hearts content. If you go just before closing some of the stalls will have sold out of their best produce, but many will be trying to get rid of what they can not store without it spoiling as the Market is closed on Sundays and many stall holders wont reopen until Wednesday or Thursday. So you can find some real bargains. If you want to experience the market at it's best, Friday afternoons see all the stalls open but without big crowds.Verdict? This is a London must visit attraction!"

I walked around a bit to get the lay of the land before I planned to buy lunch. In the middle of the market, I saw a small stand selling Prosecco. A market where I can walk around with Prosecco--how are other places not stealing this idea? My first course was a savory beef empanada with a flaky crust. Delicious! With my second Prosecco (obviously I was loving this tradition), I enjoyed a chicken and sweet potato curry over rice. So flavorful! After a bit more walking, I found Greedy Goat Ice Cream and treated myself to the Salted Caramel, which was heavenly. I loved seeing all the other foods, including crocodile and zebra burger patties, three different colors of cauliflower, and many other delicacies. I treated myself to white truffle oil as a souvenir, which was flavorful but not overwhelming. There was even a section that had music playing for entertainment. Yes, it was crowded. What market isn't? Next time I'm in London, I'll be sure to visit again."

I tried roasted meat, and potatoes with melted yellow cheese topped with mini-cucumbers. Around the market you can find a lot of bars and wine shops. It is worth to search some of them located more than several meters from the market (These were overcrowded). There were many occasions to have good shots of food and happy people with the camera. Please do remember to take a rain coat, umbrella or swimming costume (for those who like more extreme adventures). Definitely I was not disappointed, but I've been to so many nicest places that this particular market wasn't anything with \"wow\" factor."

            "review": "Street Eats @ Borough Market on 23Aug2014. son & i went to london\u2019s most famous market, borough market, on morning of 23.8.2014. took northern line from king\u2019s cross to london bridge.we were planning to try out the several famous street eats here.borough market started in the current location from 1755, though records from 1014 listed it as a market for fish, grain, livestocks, fruits & vegetables.the wholesale market opens weekdays 2am-8am. the retail market opens wednesday to thursday 10am to 5pm, fridays from 10am to 6pm, and saturdays from 8 am to 5 pm.1 of the famous eats is the \u00a35 duck confit sandwich, and that was also the first we tried. it was pretty good. the confit duck rillette was tasty & tender & did not disappoint. the ciabatta bread though was not very exciting, kind of tougher to the bite.the next we tried was the \u00a36.50 belly pork sandwich at roast. a queue built up rather quickly! it came with ok pork belly & a sheet of crispy skin. sad to say, for me the \u201ccrackling skin\u201d was about the standard of my failed belly pork attempts & quite unedible. :-( the bread was softer & better than the ciabatta of the duck confit sandwich. we didn\u2019t try the beef sandwich, perhaps that would be better.we had the single chorisa bun at brindisia. though a blogger mentioned it was more worthwhile to have the double chorizo for \u00a34.95 instead of the single \u00a33.95, my son disagreed, he thought it would be too salty with 2 chorizos, and i had to agree with him after trying it.of the 3 my preference would be (1) duck confit sandwich (2) chorizo bun (3) belly pork sandwich.we found the salt beef (corn beef) sandwich shortly. it looked really good. my son thought it looked better than it tasted. in any case we did not have space for it. nor the other food.paella seller was offering free tasting with a small plastic spoon. the taste was ok but this was like a mass cooking & well below my own seafood risotto, so held no attraction for us.they also served other dishes like calamari, cajun chicken etc.one stall was selling fresh cooked seafood, from prawns, jellied eels, whelks, crayfish salad to dorset crab.the homemade mushroom pate was very flavourful. my son bought 1 tub for \u00a34.there were exotic burgers including kangaroo, crocodile, zebra, elk, ostrich.and the olive & cheese sticks at bread ahead was another famous stall at borough market.market was quite crowded close to noon on a saturday.they had whole roast pig too!& there was free wifi at the market.overall, the few famous dishes were pretty ok though nothing really caught my fancy (too much bread/carb for me anyway). it was still better by miles than the very poor poppies fish & chip at camden which we had on 24.8.2014. see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/09/01/street-eats-borough-market-on-23aug2014/"

It's a working market where you can find artisanal products as well as your day to day market items of vegetables, fruits and meats. This is also a foodie destination where you can try a variety of meats prepared in a number if ways - you name it - roasted, fried, smoked and grilled. Experience different smells and aromas mixed together from cooked food items and fresh fruits, breads and artisanal cheeses. Mostly take-away food items as there is no sitting inside the market. Noisy and crowded, this is one of those things you need to do at least once when in London."

Seriously, you will never eat a doughnut from anywhere else ever again. There are a couple of filling options but you can get a vanilla cream in a doughnut that is the lightest dough you will ever bite into. Oh there are some great pulled pork rolls, pies and many other things.Don't go to Borough markets if you don't like crowds and don't expect to find any amazing bargains. But there is plenty of food to eat. You will have to go back more than once."

There not many other places in London that shows just how diversified London has become over the last 20-30 years. The Borough Markets adjacent to ''The Shard'' and ''London Bridge'' Underground Station is one of the most cosmopolitan gathering spots in London. There are all types of food stalls which introduce all the flavours of the mixed cultures which show just how blended London has become. Each ethnic group seems to be represented in a colourful mish-mash of colourful food offerings. There are artifacts, pubs and fresh vegetables and fruit all at affordable prices. Be careful to avoid the lunch time rush as all the local office workers get down there for the very affordable and exotic lunches on offer. Be prepared to stand because there is not a lot of seating, unless you wander off in to the adjacent church grounds and sit on the walls. You will enjoy this, even if you don't get involved in what's on offer. The sights, smells and sounds make it a great ''London'' experience."

This is not as expensive as you think as long as you come regularly and then the stall holders treat you well and you understand how to shop at Borough (avoid prepared foods as they can work expensive). Many highlights amongst the array of stalls: Spice mountain , spices not only one of one of the best in London (this is a premium spice space In the Capital) with the added zing of the owner's knowledge and banter iAds to your experience. A big mention for Paul at Sussex Fisher who goes at extremely early in the week (Middle of the night for us city plodders) and then brings it to us fresh reasonably well priced (similar to supermarket equivalents) with a smile and joke. Many others of these inspired people need mentioning, just get of your BUTTS and support UK Industry at is very best (pretty please)."

Just around the corner from The Shard and right next to Southwark Cathedral, there are a lot of good (and a couple of not so good) food stalls on offer. Some great and very friendly stallholders add to the experience. Ate some very good vegetarian Indian, so so Thai, lovely Turkish Delight and some good old sausage and egg baps. Add a cracking coffee from The Monmouth Coffee shop just outside the market and it's a great way of spending some time. TIP. Leave London Bridge Underground station via the Borough High Street exit and the market is straight across the road. Try and avoid lunch time as it gets very busy with local workers from around 12.30pm. Will definitely return again."

I particularly loved the corn on the cob stall- nothing says summer like the smell of corn on a bbq and then getting it roasting hot and dripping in butter!!

There are a ton of food stalls on one side of the street (meals, cheese, desserts, drinks, you name it) and the other side has vendors that sell things like produce, meats, alcohol, etc. that you can take home and use. We stopped at a pie place and SoulFood for lunch (the two stalls are right next to each other) and it may have been the best lunch I had during my entire two weeks in England. I got a Chicken of Aragon pie and my friend got a chicken wrap from SoulFood, which we then split. There was a stand selling some fresh mint ice tea, which was the perfect accompaniment to our meal. We even found a delicious dessert stall. I would highly recommend stopping by at least once--or twice--to anyone who is staying in London. It's an easy find right off the London Bridge tube stop, and is totally worth the trip."

A huge variety of fresh produce, spices, jams, chutneys, preserves, cured meats, seafood, cakes, sweets, chocolates...the list goes on. We savoured ready to eat food at a number of different stalls and it was all fantastic. The chorizo rolls, confit duck with a glass of sangria, chocolate brownies and fudge went down very well. It's not cheap but it's great value for money. Take you time and see everything because there is a lot to see and some places are tucked away around corners. There are conflicting reports on when it is open so hopefully this will help - a stall owner told me that the fully market is open Thursday to Saturday. It's CLOSED on Sundays and open from around 10am - 3pm Monday to Wednesdays but mostly for the lunch trade, with ready to eat stalls only open. I have been to London many times but this was the first trip to Borough market. The next time I am in London it may well be the first place I visit. Go."

The market was packed and alive. Hundreds of people waiting in lines for lovely local food. There were artisan pie makers, curry stands, sandwiches carved from whole roasted pigs, baked goods, beautiful cheeses and produce. Venders were friendly and interactive. We returned to the market Friday and Saturday, once for breakfast and once for lunch. I can't imagine there is a more impressive exhibition of British food stuffs in London."

I guess I should say buy and eat a sandwich or meal from one of the vendors first and then stroll around and shop for some of the other special foods you can buy. I had to keep remembering that I needed to carry what I was buying with me on the Tube. I was staying with friends and this was a great alternative to eating out. There are several butchers with locally grown meat. We bought one each of several types of sausages and getting to taste them all was a real treat. I was in London in January so there were wild game varieties available. There was a stall selling olives in staggering variety. We also bought several types of local cheese and bread. We enjoyed the variety and quality of our choices so much we went back a second time. This time we shopped for vegetables. I found the vendors to be very helpful, though I was there when it wasn\u2019t too crowded. There was a basket about two feet across that was filled with different types of mushrooms. We told the vendor how much I wanted and that we wanted a sampling of several types and we worked out a nice arrangement. They were delicious! I am glad we went twice as there were different things for sale in one area of the market. This time we also bought some very good chocolates and decadent slices of cake. We stopped at Utobeer both times too. We sampled a dozen different beers between the two trips. The market is located on Southwark Street and Borough High Street. It\u2019s easy to get to and it\u2019s is in close walking distance to several other great places to visit."

Be warned though, it's RAMMED, especially on a weekend, which means it's snails pace working but that's okay because it means you have even more time to sample all the food. In fact it's probably possible to fill your belly just in free samples alone, so long as you don't mind dining on every single cuisine in the world. It's mostly undercover and the stall-holders are wonderfully friendly and clearly embrace the tourism factor. Be warned though, only one set of public toilets just outside the market stall, so if you think you might get caught short then stop first."

I can sense your confusion, \"What's so amazing about a cheese toastie?\" I hear you ask. My simple answer is, imagine rows upon rows of cheese sandwiches ready to be toasted with thick, white homemade bread and ..... about 3-4 inches of grated cheese!!! Just imagine the gooey goodness! I'm sure you're smiling now? There were people standing around, some were sitting on Church steps, others were scattered across a nearby grassy area, all eating out of their hands.

The Ginger Pig is there, of course, where we regularly buy traditional pork pies, which rival the other best pork pies in England, from J Stanforth's in Skipton, West Yorkshire. And there's Fitz who supply such delicacies as truffle honey and truffle mustard plus unusual jams such as rose petal. They also sell reasonably priced tinned French cassoulets with amazing duck confit,Toulouse sausage, haricot beans and sauce.

The paella was fantastic as well! The truffle honey was a wonderful discovery, we bought several jars to bring home. I wish we could have sampled all the goodies but it was just impossible, you can only eat so much. Best to go on a Thursday or Friday to avoid the crowd. There are also many interesting pubs & restaurants nearby worth visiting. Will definitely make it a point to come back again!"

I went on a Saturday morning which hasn't been my brightest idea because it was so busy but I managed to spend enough time there to sample delights such as fresh home made pasta and a chacerteruie cone which I thought was ingenious. Ever since my trip there its all I've talked about with my friends. Next time I will go when it's mid day so I can really mooch around."

There is a real local neighborhood feel here, and Borough Market is like the neighborhood market. Most of it is under cover so this can be a good place to explore when the typical London rains are falling. There are fruits, vegetables, meats, gifts, shops, fast food from carts, just about anything you might expect to find at a market. Southwark Cathedral is next door as is London Bridge, and the London Bridge tube stop is across the street. There are dozens of great restaurants, pubs and shops in the area as well, so you can spend many happy hours exploring around here."

In the afternoon there is a lot of people having a lunch and hanging around. There was also a lot of tourists. Fortunately there is free Wifi and toilets. I thought it was bigger after reading a Wikipedia review of it, it is big but the local market in Montreal, Canada is probably the same size if not bigger. But here you can find products from all over Europe, and very good ones. To have lynch is less expensive than in most London restaurants and probably better. Even if it is cheaper than in restaurants the exchange rate for Canadians just kills it...(1.90) So when you end up paying 5.5$ or 3 pounds for one corn on the cob, you think twice...otherwise, if money is no object go and run for it. As with all public markets, there are good picture opportunities, but mpre on the high end style food boutiques."

The atmosphere on a Saturday afternoon was hectic and it was very cramped - wouldn't advise pushchairs, wheelchairs or dogs (easy to get trod on!) but was great for a couple who had time to spare. Lots and lots of stalls and the opportunity to try different foods - if you're prepared to stand and be jostled whilst eating. We found Maria's kiosk (I think it was called that) serving good, old fashioned fry-up, burgers, etc cooked by italian 'mama's' and it was the best bacon, egg and chips that I've had in years!"

Fruit and veg stalls, juice stands, bakers, chocolates, and food stalls by the plenty.We arrived early morning and it was already pretty busy and by lunchtime it was rammed. If you don't like crowds then pop in early otherwise be prepared to move at a snail's pace.From friends we've been told that this is the place to go for street food and it didn't disappoint. A half shelf of scallips, veg and bacon bits went down well, as did some three cheese pastry thing, and juices were gratefully gulped down as the sun bore down on us.I love markets and this is probably the king of them, full of sights, sounds, and awesome smells.However one thing did spoil it and that was a presumably local woman whining about the number of tourists there but I'm fairly sure the market stall owners will have thought differently.Still, great place to visit"

But I was wondering how good would it be to pick up smalls portions of food and taste as much my stomach can handle.So, we'd come back this july to London and Borough Market was on my list \"to go\" and \"to eat\".Great great time. Wonderful experience. And great cost (yeaaah!)It was me, my husband e my toddler. We all ate falafel wrap, gyozas, sausages, paella, burratas, proscuitto crudo, organic iced tea, bread and finished with the most delicious brownie ever.And we bought burrata to eat later at the hotel, of course. It's the classical street food, with great quality, great service. Little bit crowded, but... who cares? I'm not at a restaurant! I'm at a street food market having great time.Go there with no prejudices. Eat as long as you can. And as the british always says: enjoy!!"

During past trips to London, I visited all the Big Sites -- you know, the Tower of London, Harrod's, the Tate, the Imperial War Museum, etc. -- all wonderful and amazing. But this time, an English friend told me to meet him at Borough Market and I was just blown away. My jaw dropped at practically every food stall -- and I've been to many food markets in many cities in the US and Europe. (By the way, Borough Market is a much more enjoyable experience than Harrod's food court which is painfully expensive and crowded.) We ate our way through so many amazing food stalls -- many offer free tastes. I had to buy some black truffle oil to bring home with me. The Spanish section was breathtaking -- the paella, the handsome young Spanish men slicing up the Spanish ham (!). Oh, the produce! The pastries! I still have dreams about the shockingly good cream-filled donuts from Bread Ahead. I've never been a huge cream donut fan, but I'm not kidding -- you MUST have one (preferably more than one). My biggest regret is that I went to Borough Market on a Saturday, and they didn't reopen until several days later, when I had left London. Check their schedule online and make sure you leave at least 2 hours to tour around and eat as much as you can. Borough Market will definitely be my #1 stop in London for all future visits."

Lots and lots of stalls selling all kinds of foods, some mundane, some truly exotic... some ready to eat street food, some packaged . You name it, you get it, including game meat, ostrich, kangaroo.... if you have the curiosity and the appetite. There are also stalls selling pasta, fruit juices, ice creams, indian street food, ethipian caf\u00e9, gujarathi food including a limited thali, paella, various other ready to eat products..... but more Interestingly, there are shops and shops offering various kinds of speciality breads, sausages, meats, preserves, spices, sauces and dressings, oils, organic foods, chocolates, Turkish delight and baklava, fruits vegetables . drinks.... oh oh oh !!! A gourmet's delight really..... though you should not question where when and how the food was made. Much of the food is also kept in the open, so likely to pick up some street dust and assorted debris from the walking feet as they go past. But clearly the place is very popular with those wanting something different from staid old supermarket fare.... I was sorely tempted but restrained myself from getting carried away....As most of the food is upmarket and very expensive.... so the connoisseur who is willing to spend can have a ball !!"

We decided to visit Borough Market as a spur of the minute idea instead of the usual weekend routine of shopping and cleaning and I am so glad we did! The last time I had visited the market was about 25years ago so I knew it would have changed a lot and boy had it! It had grown in size and the traders are far more diverse which is a reflection on our changing food tastes and of the diverse population of the surrounding area. You can buy anything from cherries to cheese, liver to legumes. All fresh, all organic and all of high quality housed in a area that is electric, eclectic and historic. The atmosphere is hustle and bustle, noisy and heavily perfumed with the smells of cooking meats, coffee and spices that assaults the senses in a good way. We had a very good couple of hours wandering around, having tasters and spending money! I would highly recommend a visit."

Another reason to walk around first is so you can get an idea how many different choices you will have (and no, you won't get to try everything that you want, even with several visits). THEN go back and start eating. You will not go wrong with any stand that you choose, whether you try meats, cheeses, breads, or desserts. Well worth a visit."

The Borough Market is a place we always enjoy spending a bit of time, seeing what the vendors have to offer, trying out some of the French cheeses, locally produced sausages and breads, Turkish Baklava, fresh fruits, juices, organic vegetables or whatever takes our fancy... During summer visits, we find it best to stop by during the late morning before the lunch crowd arrives. At this time, the stalls and various vendors are setup and ready to go but the crowds are not too bad. Plus, you get early picks on the foods, which is nice! Further, during and after lunch, its busier then we like, especially if you are wanting to take pictures. We very much enjoy buying a few bits of food and drinks at the Borough Market and proceeding over to the River Thames riverside area to find a place to enjoy them while taking in the views. During the summer when the weather is better, this is a very enjoyable way to have a lunch in this part of the city.In addition to admiring (and trying) the foods, make sure to have a look at the building structure as well. The covered market area makes good use of green coloured cast iron capitals, columns, tracery and roof support that adds a nice architectural dimension to a visit to the Borough Markets. In the end, this is a very good food market that can be easily visited if you plan to spend time around in the Southwark area of London."

            "review": "A must-visit for any tourist in London!. London's Borough Market has been around for a long while and has always provided visitors with a plethora of dining and drinking choices. By \"dining,\" I mean the wide variety of stalls which serve quick and yummy meals. And, by \"drinking,\" I mean the various guzzling choices including wines (as well as sparkling wines & champagne), fruit juices, shakes and coffee! And for those who aren't hungry or thirsty, there are stalls which sell handicraft, art pieces, fancy crockery etc. so you'll never go bored.The entire market is very well laid out and there is more than ample room to walk around (even for those with a stroller). While it can get a bit crowded, it never really feels too suffocating. The market is also shaded so while it may rain or drizzle (and that happens often), you won't need to worry about getting wet. For food choices, I strongly recommend:1. The roast pork belly & bramley apple sauce sandwich (from Roast). This is divine!2. The salt beef sandwich which comes with pickled cucumber and mustard. Yum!3. The Spanish seafood paella. Excellent on a cold day.4. The pan-seared scallops with bacon & veggie bits (from Shellseekers). 5. The various stalls selling fresh fruits - you'll never tire from seeing the array of colours :)(And these are just my preferred stalls out of the many in one half of the market!) For any foodie (or even a first-time visitor to London), visiting the market is a must. While the prices of food, drinks, fruits, handicraft etc. are on the high side, don't let that put you off. The Borough Market is popular with tourists and for good reason too! Getting to the Borough Market is also easy. It's just outside the London Bridge tube station. A short walk up the stairs to the ground level and you can't miss it. So, getting there and back is a breeze. Aside from coming to the market with an empty stomach (so that you can savour the food and drink), come with a sturdy shopping bag too - I'm sure you'll pick things up as you walk around!"

After reading about it on social media and TripAdvisor I knew I had to visit this market in London during my summer holiday last year. I had reserved the last weekend before I flew out to visit and it was a wise decision too, as I could buy a lot of things from here including fresh mushroom pates, pickles, cheeses and sausages for my family back in India. We reached the market fairly early in the morning and with an open mind, we were really not prepared for the awesomeness that awaited us. Right from fresh fruit and vegetables to cheeses, olive oils, pates, pickles, sauces, chocolates, sweets everything was available under one roof, all fresh, of the highest quality and very affordable. Most of the stall owners give you little samplers which tantalize and tempt your taste buds to try some more and buy a jar of their concoctions. Its not just street side fare mind you, you will find high quality cheeses, truffle mushrooms, oysters and exotic meats like ostrich, alligator etc here. There are also plenty of ready to eat food stalls ranging from the good ol'English to Spanish paellas, Indian samosas and thalis, Italian, sandwiches, burgers, pies, desserts. There is not much place to sit and eat but you can definitely grab your food packet and walk around while you munch and take in more of the market. There are also craftsmen who sell stone and ceramic ware, bags etc. Pantry items like pasta, sauces etc are also in plenty. They also have a lot of special events and cookouts with professional chefs demonstrating various recipes. You may need to look up their website before hand to be a part of these events. But completely worth it. I could spend hours at the borough market. This was one of the best experiences of my London agenda. If I go back to London again it would probably have to do with the tempting of this wonderful culinary journey right in the middle of London."

I was thrilled to find such an amazing variety of food and desserts - if I lived about, I would surely have bought the fresh produce/fish/vegetables, but being a tourist, I was only able to order what I could eat then and there. I settled on Ethiopan food and ordered everything I could - chicken, which came with rice, flatbread and a choice of 2 sides - I chose lentils and spinach - and I so enjoyed the flavors and spices. My husband, on the other hand, ordered a double sausage burger down the way, with what he thought would be \"American\" mustard, but soon found out was a spicy mustard he couldn't handle!! But I loved it!! I could have spent a few days there, choicing a different lunch or dinner each day, but sadly was limited to that day. I would go more often if I could!"

I got an absolutely heavenly brownie at the Cinnamon Tree Bakery and took two steps and decided I had to get a chocolate raspberry slice at a different bakery. If you plan to eat a meal at the market be forewarned that there is not an abundance of places to sit. We eventually made our way to the yard of the nearby church and found a patch of grass for an impromptu picnic. My daughter and I had fish and chips (we splurged and had the halibut which was very fresh and good) and my son had a pie and a milkshake and a piece of cheesecake, and also got a loaf of bread and hunk of cheese for later. He's 19 and taking full advantage of his metabolism! My husband had roast pork with crackling and my other daughter had a chicken burger. We also got some fresh fruit - raspberries and blueberries - to share. Many vendors will offer small samples of their products and everyone was friendly.

A cool buzzing market selling some of the finest food and drink your likely to come acros.Love that you can grab a cold glass of wine or cider and enjoy it as you walk around the market. Great mix of people here and great places to eat both within the market and the surrounding restaurants and pubs. The street food is amazing from Thai curries to king prawn wraps or good old fish and chips. A real treasure. 5 stars."

Like sardines on a train..expect to be stood on and pushed around. I hardly saw any food ready to eat. It was a lot of cheese stalls and other random jams and stuff you put in your cupboard, not in your mouth for immediate consumption.And i was THIRSTY and there were no ice cold drinks. Just uncovered juices with no ice in them, I even sneezed into some by accident. Lol no my fault that no food or these drink juices dont have lids! So unhygienic! I wanted just a can of coke. It literally took me 40 mins to find one once we left the place. You cant walk into nandos or a pub and get one either, they only sell it to you if you SIT DOWN to eat.We ended up going for a duck wrap, it was 6 pounds each! Major rip off and once I bit into it it had a bone in it. Dont waste your time! Unless you like crowds, average food, no drink , NO TOILET and u love standing up near the sewers to eat."

I ate far, far too much and spent a very uncomfortable afternoon trawling round museums, but, it was, frankly, worth every pound of weight I gained.

My wife and I visited here on Saturday, which was a beautiful bright day.We arrived here from the London Eye by taxi, but there's two tube stations nearby - Borough and London Bridge.The Borough Market is easy to find off the main street by the Thames.It's an undercover market under a railway bridge and is uniquely set - which gives it an old fashioned feel.However, everything sold here is top class. There fresh fruit, bread, pastries of many different types - some of which I have never seen or tasted. Some give out tasting plates.You can find a garlic stall here with 15 different varieties - spices from all over the world. Lots of seasonal vegetables. Olive oil in varying grades and sizes to take away.My favourite area was the freshly cooked stalls offering an amazing array of world wide platters ready to eat - some hot, some cold. Therefore, be prepared to eat and buy food here for your larder and fridge.All of it looks well managed, clean and is priced correctly.Take some time to look around the market in the side streets where you will find other shops to suit most tastes. Plenty of places to grab a coffee or tea and have a sit down.Well worth a visit and I would return. People here were very pleasant.Expect to stay over an hour in this area of the south bank.Thank you to the community of Borough Market - it is obvious you work very hard to provide a good source of products and friendly service!"

The great selection and variety of fruits, vegetables, cheese, meats - what a sight to behold. Then, team that up with the stalls selling a wonderful variety of prepared food for eating. What a great combination and a lovely way to pass the day. For me, the only thing missing would have been some good music, but oh well...I got there by tube, getting off at the the London Bridge stop on the Jubilee line. This stop is right outside the market, so very handy. The day I was there was a beautiful, sunny day, but this event is also a great one to consider in inclement weather, as the market is fully covered, with tall overhead roofing to protect you from the elements. Note that the selections include some very nice grades of choices, noting the truffle stall, and the mushroom pate stall, the wide selection of cheeses and special meats, as examples. Excellent!"

There's something to suit everyone's tastes. In the evening most market stalls close but there are still tasty snacks and food to be had as some stalls stay open to serve hot food through the evening. This is very popular with those visiting the pubs around the market which are always buzzing with people spilling out into the streets to enjoy a beer with friends. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area night or day."

Borough olives do the best red pesto I have ever tasted along with some amazing fresh Italian olives, there is a fruit stall near the micro herbs and vegetarian street food run by an older couple with the best British strawberries, raspberries, nectarines and cherries and they are really reasonably priced. So many great oils, breads and cheeses you can easily spend a fortune so be careful! but I've found it to be a really friendly market with some great stuff to buy. worth putting up with the crowds!"

She had a salted beef and pickle sandwich (shredded corned beef) and a fresh baked pastry from two different stalls while I had the Vietnamese chicken and then a cup of delicious goat milks ice cream. The only drawbacks are the packed crowds and no where to sit down to eat. Our food did not make it as far as the grounds of Southwark Cathederal since we ate it so fast.

This market is rather famous and you may know it somewhat or very well already, but here are my thoughts from our mid May visit, first it is the best food market in London. Secondly, the quality and variety of the edibles is high and priced right to boot. Something not to be missed is Pate Moi(an organic mushroom pate) This light earthy miracle is too good to merely sample and walk on. Then there is Cannon and Cannon, makers of fine dried sausages, and they are fine indeed. Lets also mention Cumbrian Specialty Meats, where you will find wonderful Scotch eggs and the best game sausages on a stick ever. Now, equally impressive is Sweet Roots licorice(foam banana/monkeys) which sells proper licorices. Borough Nuts sells interestingly tasty chocolate macadamia nuts rolled in spice (cinnamon I think). You will want to sample a cider drawn from oak barrels , a medium dry on the potent side was my delight, have a few, they are great and priced right. You should find this kind cider seller easily along the main drag. I forgot the purveyor name, sorry. Oh, I nearly forgot, Pie Minister is just wonderful, and they set up just in front of Southwark Cathedral on the edge of the market. There is a cool area to eat beside the Cathedral, and a Pie Minister pie makes a fine edible when admiring the gothic stonework. The best times for the market are Thursday ,Friday, and Saturday. Show up and eat, drink and be merry."

Ordinarily, neither one of us is wild about crowds, but, somehow, the crowds added to the atmosphere here.

Samples, don't be shy, most of the stalls will give you a taste and of course you sample and you are hooked. They have everything from regular fruit and vegetables to exotic varieties. Meat and fish regular and exotic. Then the breads, cakes, chocolate, cheeses, olive stands and alcohol stands, so many to choose from. The spice stall is my favourite not only do they have everything you can imagine in sensible sizes and reasonable prices, the sales staff are very knowledgeable and will answer most questions you have about the spices and condiments they sell, including usage storage and unique uses.Worth the trip I\u2019d say, but remember to take a shopping trolley or at least a decent sized cool bag for all the goodies you are going to buy.

Good in salads, spread on toast, crackers or oat cakes. Caprinelle: a semi-hard raw goat cheese which is deliciously nutty in favour or with a hint of a acidity if still young.Tomme de Brebis: A hard raw goat cheese with a rich nutty flavour. Good eaten on its own/with a suitable wine accompaniment or in sandwiches.In my opinion the prices are commensurate to the high quality and should be seen from this perspective."

You will find more tourist than the regular shopper. Good place to have a quick snack. Pretty crowded during lunch on weekdays and Saturdays. Good variety of sweets from different parts of the world, make sure what it is made of to avoid disappointments.

We had a cheese sandwich (sounds pretty plain, doesn't it?) that was to die for. It had four types of cheese, red onion and leeks on homemade bread. The vendor indicated he went through four tons of cheese a week and by the length of the queue, I'm sure he was telling the truth. Worth the wait."

The best meal I had on my last trip (Nov 2013) came from the Borough Market. There's a stand that sells BBQ pork sandwiches -- I can't remember the name, but you can locate it by the very long line (que) and the delicious smell. Ate one of those for lunch and then picked from the many delicious choice to make our own \"picnic\" dinner to take back to the hotel. When you enter from the Southwark Cathedral side, it starts out with tented vendors and then it moves inside to a larger covered area and finally to an indoor artisan market with high end and high quality meats, cheeses, produce, breads, drinks, desserts -- pretty much anything you can think of! I can't imagine how much I would spend shopping there if I lived in London. It is crowded, but in a fun way. Highly recommend a visit!"

One of the food vendors (the row of food vendors at the back), was selling flat bread. He made a beautiful chicken flatbread for a customer in line, which settled what I was going to get. The item wasn't on his menu board. I asked for one of the same. By the time he made mine, I asked if it was the price of the shrimp flat bread or the price I overheard him charge the earlier customer. He charged me the higher price for the shrimp. He also took the orders of the locals (who were behind us in line) before ours. I understand treating the locals first, especially in a busy time, but charging the non locals more? Cheeky. Another dessert vendor tried to charge me more than the price on her signage. Cheeky..However, another dessert vendor (an Ozzie) was being super friendly with her patrons and even helping the tourists with how to easily identify the different coinage."

This market is more of a huge indoor,outdoor deli rather than an old style London Market so you don't usually go there to your grocery shop.Go to the award winning Pie lady that sells English pork pies in every size imaginable.To the rear RHS is a couple that sell british bakery goods and we found REAL Eccles cakes again award winning.Lastly: the fish monger stand sells all its fish HALF PRICE at the end of the day. Lobsters,crab,fish,oysters ..everything. You have to be a bit noisy to get there attention though ad it was bedlam."

The hot food carts average 4-10L per person. Lots of lovely bread vendors as well as cheese, pastries and fresh meat and seafood. Lots of men in suits, usually a sign of generous portions at a reasonable price. Pick and mix salads for the veggie people, and sausages on a stick for the low carb crowd. Well worth a look."

There's a great selection of cooked foods to choose from (I had the famous grilled cheese sandwich), but it was the fresh produce that I loved most.

We ate lunch and it was amazing. I had the homemade Italian and it was so fresh and delicious. My husband had Thai and really liked it. We had our own soda and water and were glad we brought them. We sat in the courtyard of the church next door to eat and it was a friendly place. Be sure to visit during your holiday in London. If I lived there, I think this would be a weekly visit for me.

It gets crowded so get their early if you go on Saturday. It is just a block from the London Bridge tube stop (off Jubilee line).

Breads, cheeses, cakes fruit and drinks to name but a few.Stalls covering places from afar, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, UK to name but a few. There are numerous busy hot & cold takeaway food stalls for a quick bite, a truly lovely place to visit.The market is situated in the Borough of Southwark just over the River Thames at London Bridge, beneath the railway archways close to London Bridge Railway Station and has a underground station opposite it's entrance, so is easily accessed as well as by many bus routes.The Shard a iconic landmark is only metres away as well is HMS Belfast and the Local Guy's Hospital.The market is in a lovely area with many pubs, bars and restaurants from its entrance through the nearby little streets to the river side.Oyster bars, deli bars & wine bars line it's routes, the Fish bar restaurant is slotted in nicely amongst the stalls carry on down the street and you'll find wine shops packed full with the worlds wines, patisserie slotted I as well as the usual coffee shops.Head 20 yards further in and you come to the Golden Hind 2 situated along side a lovely gastro pub The old Thameside inn.A short walk along Clink street apptly name has it as it's own museum of the local Victorian police cells worthy of a visit and you pass more eating establishments from build your own burger to nando's. This is we're you will find a little jewel in the crown. A lovely riverside pub run by The Fuller Brewery famous for its London Pride Beer amongst others. The pub is called the Anchor, and is a busy bar with a good cross of people visiting from day trippers, students and local business men/women. Serving a wide range of beers wines spirits as well as gastro pub food. The pub has it's own restaurant if you prefer to eat away from the bar, and why not sit outside on the river bank terrace which has it's own bar, here you can sit in the sun watch the world go by on the river or walk way in front of you.As you can see this is a lovely area to visit and start or finish a lovely day out. From here follow the river visiting Shakespeare's globe theatre and continue on to the London Eye and London Dungeons arriving at Westminster Bridge and the view across the Thames to the Houses of Parliament.As you can see I walked and visited many places along this short stretch of the London riverside. Never planned just explored and found little places to stop and visit. Try it yourself I know you won't be disappointed, check for market days though."

There is a great range of fruit, vegetables, meats. drinks, fish, seafood, breads, pastries, chocolates, oils etc, etc available from the myriad stalls. There are also a large number of street food stalls selling a range of vegetarian and meat options from around the globe. However, these often have massive ques and a wait of 20 minutes plus to get served is not uncommon.My tip is to bring a knife and purchase the ingredients you need for a wonderful picnic from the market stalls themselves which are always slightly quieter than the street food stalls and then assemble and eat your picnic at your leisure on the southbank or in one of the nearby pocket parks."

I highly recommend visiting with someone who doesn't mind sharing their food. To make the most of the market, pick up dishes from several of the food stalls and pass them around. We had an amazing roast pork sandwich (with crispy skin and applesauce.) If it is nice out, take your food to the courtyard outside Southward Cathedral. Walk off the first meal (visit the Cathedral and surrounding area) before coming back for round two. Also, the food vendors are all very generous with samples. Don't hesitate to ask or join the crowd. We tastes some of the best cured meats, cheese, vinegar, and mustard we've ever had. Grab some snacks to stash in your hotel minifridge for those late night munchies. London's street food scene is so vibrant, that you could really avoid the touristy restaurants and just spend your days eating at places like this."

Many vendors give small samples--- be polite and just take one sample. After that, you are just being greedy. Afterwards, take a stroll along the Thames. On a sunny day, you can walk either direction from London Bridge and see many sights. I took in St Paul's Cathedral as well. Great photo opportunities."

The variety of food is overwhelming and you really need to spend some time just walking through the different corridors and alleyways to see all that is offered. There are also a number of restaurants and pubs if you want to sit down, relax and enjoy your food the old fashioned way. But save that for later - and explore the various stands for unique food and drink offerings. There are plenty of the old standards as well, so don't pass it up because you like simple fare. We sampled so many different items and purchased several to take home with us. Everything is available - from the fresh fish and meat and vegetables stands to the cooked in front of you samples from around the world. I could have stayed for hours and snacked all day. I went based on reviews I had read - but the market far surpassed my expectations. It was the best morning we spent in London!"

Then we tried the paella and it was delicious. Next we moved on to salted beef & mustard sandwich. Apparently the duck sandwiches are a must have but we missed it. Nibbled on a lot of cheese, packing some Comte is a must; Sipped on some champagne and mulled wine. Dessert was a super delicious drool worthy Banoffee slice, ended with some Turkish coffee and Turkish Delights!! Seems like quite a melting pot, doesn\u2019t it!

Comfort over fashion here is key you will eat until your belly swells, have wine & do it again several times in a few hours. We came here on our last day in London & I regret we waited until then once I bit into the sandwich, I suggest as mentioned going early it gets packed with the bankers at lunch & they run out. The Argentinian empanada stand is also scrumptious I suggest grabbing a wine barrel seat at the wine stand across from it, ordering a glass & enjoying your tasty scavenge. We brought a scotch egg all the way back to Boston, & enjoyed it 10 hrs later. This is a MUST when there especially if you have a vacation rental & need groceries. I would suggest doing a full lap this place will give you the munchies even if not high & you might fill your belly before getting to the good stuff. Find a way to smuggle cheese from here back home & make a melty tomato, cheddar & cress sandwich to ease back to reality when you get home from vacation....it helps"

The ready to eat food is about what you'd pay for lunch elsewhere in London so it's great valueBeing so close to the station it's worth a visit on your way past, but be prepared to carry things home with you!"

It usually opens at 10am except on Saturday, when it opens at 8am, so it is recommended to schedule your South Bank trip on a Saturday and start with Borough Market. In the market you'll get to experience the very best of British and International fresh produce. You will find bakeries, charcuteries (yum...), dairy products, wine and spirits (take a cup of hot mulled wine to go, you'll thank me later), fish and seafood, spices, fruit and vegetables, meat, poultry and even game (try the boar saucisson).Tip: even though it's not a large market and some products look at the same, it worth your while to first explore the whole market and only then make a purchase. We encountered some products that were identical but sold on different prices by nearby traders!"

As well as the market itself the surrounding area has many speciality food and drink stores. ( I particularly recommend Vinopolis its range of whiskys is truly awesome) There is a wide range of street food but only take small portions so you get a chance to try as many as possible. If you want to sit at a formica table and eat some tasteless pap and be told to have a nice day, fine but don't expect this here, it is stand and eat off a paper plate with a plastic fork. The difference is the food will actually taste of something other than ketchup.If you are not staying at a hotel buy some of the fresh food for cooking your own meals, the range and quality is spectacular."

We went for dessert at hotel chocolate's restaurant (ace place!) and then returned to do some shopping. You can pick up some real bargains between 4:30 and 5pm like the fish and meat but be warned a lot of the cakes and breads etc will have been sold. We got everything we wanted plus some tasty extras like wild wood pesto and papered cheese. The staff on the stall were all so friendly and happy to give advise if you have a recipe in mind. Most stalls also take card but only on \u00a310+ there are cash points around but I'd recommend taking cash to avoid queuing. We will be back at soon as possible!"

The closest Tube station is London Bridge but on a nice day and with time to spare, I recommend getting off at St Paul's station and walking to the market. And there's plenty to see along the way including, St Paul's Cathedral, the Millennium Bridge, the Tate Modern, the Shakespeare Globe, the Golden Hinde II, and Vinopolis (wine, whisky and food sampling tours).Once at the market you can find a whole gamut of cheeses, meats, vegetables, beverages and sweets/cakes from all over the UK and further afield. Mediterranean fare is very popular but there's also a stall selling exotic meats (ostrich, kangaroo, crocodile, antelope etc). Some of the butchers and fishmongers provide vacuum-packing but not all, so ask before you buy if you need to ship the produce home. If you'd rather sit down there are numerous restaurants, pubs and eateries to choose from. Some restaurants and stalls were hugely popular judging from the long queues. We can vouch for the salted beef sandwiches and the Sussex oysters but everything looked very tempting. Prices are on the steep side but the market is great entertainment in its own right and you can easily spend a couple of hours here."

Very cheap previously frozen bread roll, batter on fish very greasy and soggy-fish tasteless-cery disappointed!I have my own food business and use Hobbs House bread-it's always the bread that makes the food-why do these traders not learn that it is simply a crime to have a superb filling surrounded by a cheap (and usually stale) white bap! My partner had a chorizo roll from Brindisa however (for the same price as the mackerel) and said it was nice-artisan bread too-hooray!I feel that Borough market was distinctly average for its number of cheese and meat stalls etc and to be honest over rated compared to other markets I have visited-eg Stroud farmers market.Anyway I visited Partridges Food Market in Chelsea last Saturday-can't recommend it highly enough!

It does have a few very healthy stalls, including wheatgrass shots and smoothies, and other healthy treats. The hot cider stall is very welcoming on a cold day and you can also get lots of tasters of many other foods on sale. There is plenty of fruit and veg on sale.

The range of food on offer is mind blowing - Comte cheese comes as 12 month old, 18 month, 24 month and 36 month, samples allowing you to learn about maturing cheese, so educational as well as gastronomic. The fruit, vegetables and meat are of the highest standard and not too highly priced considering it is in London. The staff serving are very knowledgeable, especially the lovely lady on the stall selling the amazing array of mushrooms. It is fascinating to watch the hand carving of hams. I could wander round this market for hours and spend a fortune, perhaps it is good that I don't liver closer!"

Just a short walk from the Tower Bridge is conveniently located too.I wish I had more than one stomachs, but I did the Brandizo chorizo roll which was excellent. Mammoth coffee's line was too long but it's good I guess as it forced me to get a giant brownie and unfortunately I don't remember the name. But it's in a bakery stall that's right in the middle of everything you can't miss it and the brownie sizes are what normal people would consider like two brownies. But you can handle it. :)"

If you can only go for one day try Friday it\u2019s a little less busy so easier to get round and all the stalls are open. It has an amazing array of foods to try and to buy, so much more than is readily available here in the north east. I do feel that some of the prices are a little hiked up because of its reputation but the quality of everything that I bought or sampled was excellent. I can\u2019t wait to go again but take a big case to get it all home because if you a devoted foodie like me you can get a bit carried away oops!"

You can find porcini from Tuscany, all sort of french sausages, milk straight from a cow, any fish you want,seafood so fresh,lemons from Amalfi coast, bread- fresh baked,and thousands more....

A fantastic variety of meat, fish, vegetables, bread, cheese, sweetmeats, etc. Take your pick from dozens of take-away stalls and go sit on one of the benches by the marvellous Southwark Cathedral.Saturday is heaving (not the place for a buggy) and almost impossible to find somewhere to sit down, it's much nicer during the week. Filled with character and charm and reminiscent of dimly lit old London films (trains even rumble overhead to add to the atmosphere), Starbucks and wagamama etc are no doubt knocking on the door, but let's hope this market continues as it is and doesn't suffer the same fate as other markets, such as Spitalfields which is now crammed with fashion and media types at the weekends and stalls full of overpriced 'craft'."

EvEn though it was a blustery very wet February Saturday afternoon, the market was packed, the stalls were piled high and selling fast, the benign interested spirit of the people of all ages was uplifting and the selection of food sublime refreshing and seductive. Some but not too much ready food from a selection of natural to heavily spiced Turkish teas through a wide range of Normandie produce and a thousand more choices. The regular thundering of the overground railway above us, the Cathedral bells, occasional emergency sirens from the busy road to the east and the happy buzz of all those in the market. Everything is here. Barely two hundred metres from the river, right beside the Cathedral and three or more very good pubs, less than five minutes slow walk from the tube and London Bridge Station. It's a delightful busy intersection of lives. Highly recommended. We come back and back."

We found some nice dry sausages, French cheeses, breads, olives and baklava during our last visit and will no doubt, return to the Borough Markets during future trips to London to pick up more food selections. We have also enjoyed very good breakfast food at Maria's Market Cafe in the middle of the Borough Markets and are fans of the Monmouth Coffee Shop and Robat 1745, for excellent hot chocolate drinks, at the marketplace. In the end, the Borough Markets is a very good place to visit, take pictures and to try some nice foods in London.

I had some of the best summer sausage here. The cheeses were excellent. Our British friends who brought us here said that many restaurants source their produce at Borough Market. There were tons of locals shopping here. We ate a restaurant close by that was covered with multiple brightly colored umbrellas. I loved this. Such a cool area. This is where I got to experience Pimm's punch. I found a nearby liquor store and bought a bottle to bring home."

Find out from their website what's available for the day because the market has special days for antiques, etc etc in addtion to its normal market produce. In the market there are numerous stores and stalls selling foods from cheeses to freshly shucked oysters to breads. You can go around tasting the samples. There are also many restaurants in the vicinity. We tried the \"Fish Restaurant\". Its a large restaurant at the side of the market. The fish and chips was very good, the portion quite large. In spite of the large crowd in the restaurant, the service was very fast and friendly."

The only thing negative is managing to decide which stall to actually buy something from! I dare say that a favorite is \"The Exotic Meat Company\", even if I know I might be criticized by some of you, and the stall with the raclette that melts cheese! If you don't want to do any shopping, you still should visit as the market offers a lot of photographic opportunities and there is no way you will witness any interaction that doesn't include smiles!

Borough Market is well worth a visit if you want to buy some speciality foods or just go to browse and eat there \u2013 there is plenty of choice.It is, of course, a far cry from the street market that used to be there and I'm sure the original food vendors would be turning in their graves but it is a great market nonetheless. If you are a visitor to the area, pop round the corner and have a look at the replica 16th century sailing ship the Golden Hinde II and have a pint in the Thames-side pub just alongside or wander into Southwark Cathedral right next door. Also in the immediate area are the Shard and the site of one of London's oldest prisons - The Clink. A super way to spend a morning - but beware of the opening hours - it is not open every day."

It's also in a great position for being able to mooch along the south bank. I would highly recommend this place."

Difficult to describe this experience as there is so much to do for all ages, budgets etc. This is a great attraction for both visitors and locals with a huge variety of stalls and things to both view and buy. The atmosphere is fantastic and this is not your run of the mill tourist spot, but a working breathing historic market, serving the local and fine food communities. Close to tube station and other attractions in the Bankside area."

In November 2013 whilst in London, my girlfriend and I came across Borough Market, which was rather fortunate as we were looking for a place for lunch. The market can be located just a short walk from London Bridge station. Come out the front where they are selling the London Bridge Experience Tour and go left, across the road and down the stairs to go under the bridge / underpass and here you will find Borough Market.The entrance this way brought us passed a caf\u00e9 that had set up an impressive (and huge) pan of meatballs and next to it paella. Being close to Christmas they were also selling mulled wine. This ended up being too much to resist and we had a bit of each for a reasonable amount of money and I have to say it was very good.From here we ventured into the market proper and there was an impressive array of market stalls. Sweets, cakes, Oriental food, roast hog, small gifts and the majority hand / home made at generally fair prices, especially if you buy the deals on offer. For those interested there was even a gluten free stall, so you could still enjoy the naughtier variants of food! It does get and was busy when we were there so it can be a bit slow getting around. If you are an easily frustrated person and / or impatient for others to get moving or out the way, it may be best to wait until a quieter time to visit.All in all this was a very pleasant little market and of the small amount of things we bought (all food) the quality was excellent. On top of that it doubled up as a great place for lunch, with a multitude of options to choose from depending on your mood and tastes."

Easily accessible via the tube to London Bridge Station, Borough Market is a mind-blowing experience in food retailers all under one roof. Here, you get everything from fine imported cheese to multi-cultural favorites from Turkey and beyond.What I loved most about this particular market was the energy of both the buyers and the sellers. You think back to a traditional British market as depicted in novels and movies when vendors would holler out their menus or products for sale to attract customers, and you get Borough Market today. Situated in a restored high-ceiling market area, the layout is confusing at first but after awhile you forget about it as you wander from one delicious stall to the next. I saw a lot of people come not just to buy food, but to take in the whole electric local market experience. I did some prior homework before going so I knew which stalls to visit, but then I found so many more after getting there. It was a fun afternoon.If you visit only one market in London, Borough Market is it."

There is a lot of good quality produce, but go with stalls where the pricing is clearly marked. We started to buy some honey roast nuts. The guy is very quick to start shovelling them into a bag and his accent was hard to understand and he kept trying to push other stuff onto us. When our bag was weighed it came to \u00a315! It wasn't much bigger than a bag you would buy in a supermarket of, say, honey roasted nuts. The prices were not shown. We said we didn't want them, the guy grumbled but we just walked off.

As you continue on through the market you come to the farmers market area with people selling fruits, vegetables, seafood, meats, and even hard to find spices.

A proper food market in the heart of London, with everything from a potato wholesaler to oysters, truffles and game. Most of the stalls offer tasters of their produce and the variety is very interesting. This is a great bet for lunch on the hoof, with many, many stalls selling hot meals to go from burgers, wraps, curries, paella, hot salt beef to oysters, game and cakes. A word of warning; it can be expensive (but where in London isnt), and can be very busy at the weekends - but i think this enhances the experience. Theres a proper london caf in the middle, run by proper London ladies for cheap for honest food (i think the stall holders go here for tea and bacon rolls). In the summer, we scoffed a kilo fresh Kent cherries (never tasted better) and a apple almond cake for lunch, washed down with prosecco by the glass! In the autumn, we had more cake and hand made ammeretti (heaevn). You can also sit in the ground of Southwark cathederal or pop into their lovely cafe to warm up if its cold. Definately worth the trip, a favourite place of mine in the capital. Go hungry to really enjoy! Great thing to do as a couple; brilliant with the kids"

We popped in here for the first time and absolutely loved it. Tons of great food stalls and eateries with great tasting and reasonably priced food. This is the perfect place to browse through to get some good food for lunch on the go. Absolutely loved the atmosphere as well."

There are all kinds of food and drinks from around the world that you can think of! (I didn't know there's something called \"chocolate wine\".) Most of the products sold here is organic, fresh, cheaper and more diverse (compared to grocery stores like Sainsbury and Tesco). People are very friendly! You can also get free samples from many stalls such as olive oil, bread, cookies, cheese, organic hand-made granola, pat\u00e9, curry, etc. This is a great place to hangout with your friends, to shop, or just simply to discover new kinds of food and drinks!"

I like the tasting experiences in the market. You can find your own taste before purchased. the traders are very helpful will answer all your questions about their product. However, I find that the seafood a little pricy there.If you drop off from the London Bridge tube station is a easy way to reach the Market."

We left with bags full of pickles, chutneys and pates. A real must be a sausage roll from the Ginger Pig stall. Never see so much meat in a sausage roll and not overpriced either.

We were there on a cold day in the first week of January, and mulled wine was being sold by the glass. The combination of the warmth and mild buzz from the wine with the energy of the place and the friendliness of the stall-keepers made for a pleasant hour or so. And I\u2019m sure it would have been much the same without the wine. It\u2019s the place and the people that count, hands down.It claims to have a reputation as the country\u2019s most renowned food market, and if so, it\u2019s with good reason. It\u2019s pretty large, with lots of stalls, and even on this cold day, it was busy with locals doing their shopping. The market itself started in the 13th century, when various traders around London Bridge were relocated there.The variety of foods on offer, from British to international, is pretty big, too. The full market is open Thursday, Friday and Saturday, while the Green market is open Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Check their web site for specific hours. The nearest underground is London Bridge. No dogs are allowed, other than guide dogs, it\u2019s a smoke free area, and it\u2019s in the congestion zone. Those are the things to be aware of before setting off.Depending on what you\u2019re planning to do, you might need permission before taking photographs or filming, but most stalls allow photographs for customers.Overall, it\u2019s a good place to visit, and a real boon for the local residents"

I've read a lot about Borough Market when I was researching on markets to go during my first trip to London, and from all the raving reviews, I was certainly having some high expectations of this food market that even locals were raving about. And it certainly did not disappoint! From kebabs to hotdogs to cheese to organic oatmeal and ice cream, they literally have almost every kind of food you can think of, and then some. I walked past a stall that sells cakes, and for some reason I stopped to look at what they have. I'm a sucker only for cream cakes, and this stall doesn't have any. They have some cheesecakes, some brownies, but I was somehow captivated by this \"Zesty Lemon Cake\" that looks so ordinary. Deciding to just throw caution to the wind (after all this is my first visit to London! Shouldn't think so much when trying new food!), I bought a slice of that zesty lemon cake despite not being a fan of anything lemon-ish (I hate lemon stuff). And the first bite just made my eyes go wide as it tastes fabulous! It wasn't too sour, nor was it too sweet. The balance was great, and each bite was a refreshing one. It was so good that I almost didn't want to share it with my partner. I reluctantly let him have a bite in the end, and even he said that it was fantastic (and he was one of the most critical food critic I've ever known). I'm sorry I couldn't remember the name of the stall (I'm bad with names!), but I think there's only one stall there that sells such cakes. There's another stall that sell mostly cheesecakes, but this isn't it. I've attached a picture of the zesty lemon cake so that fellow travellers could seek it out if they are interested. My partner found himself tasting some sample bits of a chocolate chip cookie and he bought one almost immediately. He said the cookie literally melts in your mouth, and he finished a HUGE one on his own (they looked really big!). Cost \u00a32 each.There are also other exotic produce that's being sold in Borough Market, and all you need to do is just explore and walk around. Vendors and stallholders are kind enough to let you take photos of their food too. Absolutely wonderful market.I would go London again JUST to go this market and of course, to have that zesty lemon cake again!"

Prices for food can be a little on the steep side and it's easy to get carried away. I don't think you can beat the duck baps just by the market porter pub for a tasty bite, but there is plenty of choice. Fridays and saturdays it can get absolutely rammed - but that's when the largest number of stalls are there. But weekdays there are also plenty of places open to grab a bite for lunch. Well worth factoring into a walk along the south bank on your way to the tate or from Tower Bridge into town. If you go on a weekday grab some money before you go - the queues for the cashpoints can be hoorendous around that area and sometimes run out!"

There only thing was that it was a little bit hard to fine drinks to accompany your snacks or meals. There are some restaurants also inside. If you go deeper inside the market you will find vegetables, cheeses, fishes and all you can imagine for sale to cook at home. One curious place was the exotic meet stall, they cad zebra, kangaroo and what not, and even made burgers of these to go! We would have loved to return to this market again during our short stay, but we will for sure next time we visit!"

Lovely street food - Indian, traditional pies, wraps - all sorts of food. It didn't seem expensive. I'm sure earlier in the day it would have been far busier and more of the stalls would have been open. The architecture is fantastic but its worth visiting to see the beautiful glass sitting area with the hops growing up the side, eating your lunch & sitting and watching the traffic drive past."

It's my 'kid in candy store' place. I absolutely, completely, entirely love it. That's the gushing bit over. Now to what they provide...Aside from selling top notch ingredients they also sell artisanal food to eat on the go (in my opinion some of the best street food you can get in London). It's a labyrinth. A foodies dream. Everything you look at is produced with such care and thought that you can't help but walk around in awe.If you're going to eat and not just shop for ingredients then you can choose from every kind of food imaginable. I honestly don't know where to begin when describing the variety on offer, all I can say is it's highly unlikely they won't have what you're looking for.They have everything from Indian, Chinese, British, Mexican, Pastries, Cheeses, Preserves, Sauces, Meats, Hog Roasts, Soul Food to Flowers and Tableware. All stand next to each other with a lot more around the corner. It's never ending and eclectic as hell.If you decide to go I advise that you get there early as it dies down in the early afternoon and you won't get the true vibe of the market when it reaches its tail end. Part of the fun of the market is the hustle of it all, market traders shouting, smells of fresh food wafting in the air etc...We had a wonderful Sausage Sandwich with Caramelised Onion Chutney on crusty yet soft bread (\u00a36.50). I have no problem parting with money if the ingredients are good, and at Borough Market pretty much everything they sell is above par.Borough Market10/108 Southwark StreetLondonSE1 1TJ0207 407 1002www.boroughmarket.org.uk"

It was about 10:30 am and it wasn't too busy, so it was perfect for me to wander and take photos and to drool over all the cheeses and goodies. I went back on Saturday with a friend at lunchtime for the purpose of eating a paella I saw previously. I could eat here all day! I could happily just walk through the stalls and constantly snack on smoothies, sangria, macaroons, fudge, cookies, cheese, bacon sandwiches, croissants etc. Unfortunately I didn't, and limited myself to just the paella, macaroons and a piece of fudge.If you've been to Toronto (Canada), Borough Market is like a broader version of St. Lawrence Market. There are two parts to Borough Market, and both are delicious. The smaller section has the sweets, and the larger area has the butchers and food. There is an area to sit down should you want to take a break and dine, and there is also a bathroom at the Market. I really recommend visiting here for lunch, to pick up gifts, and it's a great place to take photos."

We passed many great sites like Shakespeare's Globe Theater, The Anchor tavern, and the Clink Street Museum. Walk through the alley where the old sailing vessel \"Golden Hinde\" is located and there is Borough Market. It is a great quaint open air market with vendors of everything. Fresh market foods, macaroons, pastries, tarts, breads, cheeses, wines, beers, etc. We picked up some truffle oil and fig preserves as they are both expensive in the States but sold there for half the price! What a great experience to run in to while walking London, but were told it was only open Thurs, Fri, and Sat...and we went through on Thurs. It was busy with lunch time business traffic, but that added to the flare of the market! Easiest stop with least amount of walking though would be at the London Bridge station stop on the Underground Tube system. The vendors we used took credit card.

The large, open building has its permanent tenants and in between, the smaller outlets. We bought olives, bread, cheese (from Bath - delicious!), strawberries, cake and sausages. We had a bratwurst on a stick and a pretzel for lunch but could have chosen from paella, curry, raclette, duck sandwiches or a roast dinner, amongst other things. Meat, fish, freshly shucked oysters, artisanal breads, pastries, cakes, cheeses, olives, olive oil, truffles, small goods, fruit and vegetables were all there. And tucked away on one side, a barber's shop. Outside the market, you'll find other interesting shops, eg Neal's Yard Dairy with its amazing range of cheeses, the German sausage shop and The Market Porter pub with benches outside.Consider visiting on Thursday or Friday when there's plenty of action, but avoid the weekend when it's very busy. After many visits to London, this was our first visit to the Borough Market.

On Thursdays and Fridays in particular, you'll find plenty of locals stepping out for a bite of lunch there as well.Tips: *While some vendors do take cards, bring cash and your own market bags to consolidate purchases.*If you want to browse without the crowds, go on Thursday, or between 10-12 on Friday.*If you want to enjoy the full chaos of the market, try Friday afternoons and Saturdays.*Don't overlook the permanent shops and restaurants along the roads bordering the market (Stoney Street and St. Thomas) - they're excellent.*Sample everything, and take the time to talk to the vendors. Many of these products are a labor of love, and the vendors I've met are so happy to talk to you about them.*It's family friendly - there's plenty to keep kids entertained (and fed)."

I went to Borough market expecting the usual market fare but the amount of food available surprised me. From fresh food to cooked food. Sample as much as you can before buying. You might find something you didn't want to buy, but have to buy."

Me and my boyfriend are both self proclaimed 'foodies' and love the good stuff and finding new things. We LOVE it here, definitely a place for foodies! It is a bit pricey and we usually keep it for special occasions, but lunch and some things are a great price and if I lived around there I would definitely be there more. The falafel we had was incredible, and the raclette, don't even get me started how much I love it. The Ginger Pig has the best steaks! It is a beautiful market, fresh and vibrant, with great produce, specialty items, beer, seafood, loads of desserts and breads and cheese....just make sure to go (I think they are fully opened now on wednesday) so either wednesday/thursday would be ideal otherwise it gets really crowded during fully open days!"

The market is packed with stalls selling everything from artisan breads, the best mushroom pate ever, delicious cheese and all manner of fish and meat.It's as much a tourist attraction as a market so take sharp elbows if you want to do some serious shopping (and beware of pickpockets - not a serious issue but just a wise precaution). There are cashpoints at banks just outside for anyone suffering a 'blown wallet' and be prepared to spend serious money - but you won't regret it.There are plenty of food stalls in and around the market for a mid-shop pit stop"

Not on a par were the dumplings, 4 for 3 pounds - doughy, little filling but tasted ok with their good chilli sauce. The duck confit in a roll had generous amount of duck (quite salty) so it's best if you can find someone to share it with their white sangria - 8 pounds for roll and drink. I must go back as there's the paella, the steaks, the curries, the salted beef, the small goods, the exotic meats and sausages and much much more.

There was an amazing variety of fresh foods from every cuisine available and lots of opportunity for tasting. It was also a pleasure to just wander the stalls of produce from small organic producers from around the UK.

Make sure you are as hungry as possible because you will need all that space in your stomach. You will probably end up wishing you could taste more stuff. The best strategy would be to do a little search of vendors and short list the ones you are particularly interested in before you go. Or you can take your chance by going for vendors that have queues lining up in front of them. Among the ones that I have been able to taste, my favorites are: beef pie with gravy sauce at Mrs King\u2019s Pork Pies and duck sandwich at Le Marche du Quartier. Go ahead, explore and enjoy!"

The variety of foods are amazing....and the fresh fruit and vegetable display,s are truly a sight to beholden! We never come away feeling disappointed. Although a little on the expensive side....the market really does cater for everyone's tastes...and I suppose as it is in the capital....you could expect that. Our recent visit has seen a re-design, where they have modernised/updated a number of stalls. We thought it looked brilliant and worked very well....not loosing any of it's traditional looks and expectations. I particularly liked the huge glass facade that has been erected....amazing! Anyone visiting this area of London...and is a bit of a foodie....really should spend some time here....it's truly amazing....and makes you question why markets ever went out of fashion?

As others have written before me, this is a fun foodie heaven. I took the tube to the London Bridge station and walked about 2 minutes to the market. I found vendors friendly and willing to spend some time talking about their goods like the fish monger, the man selling the market bags (which I bought), and the butchers selling the wonderful game sausages (which I ate). The man selling the market bags also has an interesting book of the history of the market. He was kind enough to give it to me gratis after I asked him about shipping home various goodies. Yes, you can eat your way through the market on samples like cheeses, pates, fruit, bread. The spanish stall was lovely and so was their classic Almond cake. I liked the art of Richard Bramble on beautiful dinner ware but couldn't carry it home so I bought his greeting cards of the market instead. The fresh beet and carrot juice was refreshing on a hot day. As another reviewer wrote, it is located in the revitalized Southbank area and within walking distance of the Thames, the Old Globe theatre (which looks new) the Southwark Cathedral (next door), the Tate Modern Museum (shich I visited) and the Millennium Bridge (which I walked across to St. Paul's Cathedral). I was not disappointed and would return in a heartbeat. I so wanted a kitchen to do some cooking with their lovely ingredients!"

It is divided into sections such as produce, seafood, bakery etc so you just walk around and buy whatever you like either to take home or eat on the spot. Most of the booths give out free samples to try their products which if you time it right you can make a lunch out of free samples. There are booths undercover and out in the open so just take your time and browse around there is loads to visit. When you think of market i kind of think about those car boot places or riffy looking market stalls that sell junk but this market is the complete opposite to that. It is so clean and tidy and all the food just looks amazing that you would want to buy everything. It is very easy to get to it is right opposite london bridge underground station, you cant miss it. We went on a saturday quite early so it was quite quiet but the later you go the more busy it gets but i really liked this market and it was one of my highlights in london. I will be recommending this market to people and will definitely come again as i brought loads to take home."

I was not disappointed.There are stalls everywhere with sweet and savoury treats. The market was bustling with punters sampling the food on offer which ranged from paella to turkish delight, cheeses to pies, and cakes to baklava.Definitely worth a visit if you're a foodie as you will not be disappointed with the range of stalls and traders all encompassed in this authentic market right across from London Bridge."

The management and staff here are doing a really top job, by presenting a nice olde fashioned market area, with a wide distribution of edible products, not only from the British Isles, but from many places in Europe. It is kept spotless by a diligent band of cleaners; they even wash the tops of the garbage bins daily !!! There are adequate toilet facilities. There is a bus service to the door. The subway is moments away. It is easy to while away a full day here and still come back again. Also good to go here in inclement weather, as it is covered. Things are not overpriced and it is possible to pick up a lot of bargains. Top marks, London."

If you have been checking out tourist locations you will undoubtedly recognize that they are littered with global food chains. If you want a break, definitely come here. The market smells really fresh and the food is fresher! I believe the market is only open Thursday through Saturday at later times (5 p.m.), otherwise you will have to come earlier on the other days (before 3 p.m.). It is closed on Sunday. But even when it is closed one can still walk through and see it. The local cafes and eateries are still open though when the market is closed, so it is still a great experience. I would suggest getting a coffee from Monmouth, or a gelato from 3BIS while you are there. Both are fantastic!"

The disappointing part of the day was; I was unable to try everything, but I will return.Suggest getting there early to have a good look round before London arrives for lunch.

I got hooked on the meringue puffs, the olives and the charcuterie...Also, this is a market of other things -- such as flowers and soaps, etc.Finally, if you desire to eat sitting down, the Southwark Cathedral has a nice sitting area right next door on the market side. Don't miss the cathedral by the way, it's 800 years old, has the history but lacks the crowds of other churches in London."

It was my second visit at Borough Market and it was absolutely awesome!This time I came with my 12 year old daughter and she loved it too.When you plan your visit to London, try to clear couple of hours, go and enjoy this wonderful place.It is very easy to get to the market by the Tube. You need to go to London Bridge Station (once ther, use the Borough High Street exit at the station) and the market is just 2 minutes away.The market opens daily (closed on Sundays), Mon-Wed 10am-3pm, Thursday 11am-5pm, Fri 12pm-6pm and Saturday 8am-5pm. Be aware that on weekends during lunch it gets very busy, but it's a great atmosphere.The variety of foods is outstanding. Fruits, vegetables (the tomato stand, OMG), many stands that sell huge sausages (hotdogs if you insist, but not the one you think..), sandwiches, oysters, cheese, cakes, natural juices, hot cider (with or without alcohol) \u2013 are you hungry yet??One of the best experiences at this market (for me) is the stand that has a \"melting\" machine, and you can see how a huge piece of cheese is melting right in front of you and they literally pour the cheese on a beef sandwich or on a baked potato \u2013 Yummy!So, if you into trying new and authentic tastes, or if just love good food, don't miss this place!"

There are places that have the larges woks I have ever seen full of curries etc. And there is a place that has the best grilled cheese sandwiches with onions and leeks. What at treat!! My husband and I split a grilled cheese sandwich and had a lovely bowl of olives from one of the stalls. I would love to live near by and go here to shop! Just full of people but seemed to flow well and you were able to stop and sample or shop without feeling pressured at all. A wonderful find!"

Great market with lots of yummy food. Many of the stalls also provide free samples which was really great! It was pretty busy but we were still able to comfortably navigate the market with our stroller (just a couple spots where it was a bit tight). Such a great selection - cheese, spices, meats, pastries, pies, olives etc. Based on the reviews we ended up going to Monmouth Coffee, there was barely a line up when we went which was nice but the coffee while was good (strong but not bitter), wasn't necessarily special. Had a grilled cheese sandwich from Kappacaesin which was really tasty and I highly recommend it. Had the chorizo sandwich from Brindisa, it was good but I didn't think it was amazing. Also had oysters at Richard Haywards and it was yummy. There are 3 options - small, medium or large rock oysters. I did not try the large but had the small and medium, personally preferred the small as it had more flavor. We missed out eating at Roast (as we were full but am now totally disappointed) but the line up was quite long and the food looked really good. Great place to visit and I highly recommend it, just be prepared for crowds and lines."

The most fun way I've found in London to find something reasonably priced to eat. The real highlight though was the Spice Mountain stall. So many different spices and ready made mixes for any type of meal with experts on hand to offer excellent advice on what to try in your cooking. I wasn't overly confident cooking with spices before but I now have a much wider range of signature dishes to impress friends with. You must visit these guys."

Here you can buy foods such as Thai, Arabic, German, French, Spanish... with a very healthy dose of bakery related goodies. Part of the charm is that you can just buy something and eat it right there and then wander to the next stall to try something new.I came away after eating a vension sausage burger, a summer burger, a gluten and dairy free brownie and with a wonderful smoothie. The total cost we spent was \u00a320 between us, which is not bad at all!Definitely worth a visit! Lots of things to nibble on and try, and plenty of food artistic photography to be had!!!"

You can find amazing products here, nice street food from many places around the world, fresh meat and bakery products. However, I was a bit disappointed because I didn't find the same variety and scale of vegetables and fruits as in other markets and also found them a bit expensive compared to other prices."

The market looks like it has been at this location forever. It is very old and is huge, open air with a roof. We walked all around the food booths getting free samples. We finally settled on lunch from a vendor with huge woks full of 3 different offerings- paella and two kinds of curry. We also bought the most delicious fig and almond fruitcake from a Swiss vendor selling cheese. The fruitcake was a little pricey but it was so good we asked our friend who is still in London to bring more back to Texas. We visited Portobello Market on this trip and this market is a much better destination especially if you like food. The market is close to the Globe Theater so we wandered over there and bought tickets for a matinee and stood up for the performance. The day felt like a genuine London experience."

My favourite are the pork belly rool, so so good with crackling and apple sauce. The bread stalls are very good as well although obviously the bread is so fresh and chemical free it does not last anywhere near as long as the super market, but its infinitely better. I have also bough meat from butchers which are high quality. A very good market to go to the only down side is the price, it is an expensive market just like most of London things."

We love it after a long run, or walk, on the Southbank; a real treat to sit and relax and have breakfast/ lunch, and enjoy the world go by, in the busy hustle & bustle of a food market. Yummy fresh food from all over Europe, and great take out: oysters, organic burgers, smoothies etc. Nice restaurants too.

Cheese, meats, flowers, teas and coffees on offer all present danger to your wallet, but prices are quite reasonable. However, the best way to enjoy is to plan on a bit of a nibble party later, whether at your flat or hotel. SInce only a knife is needed its easy to eat later. I bought an amazing Welsh cheddar from TeiFi, matched with a rich Parmasean from The Ham and Cheese Company. Samples of course give you a taste of your future snack but even better was talking with the vendors about where their good originated from. For a bit of fun, I added a few sausages (Venison, Boar and Spicy) from Exquisite Deli, which were wonderful. In total I spent less than \u00a320 for two cheeses, three sausages, an a large chibiatta bread. Most of these vendors have websites as well.The tea vendors were terribly convincing, but I resisted the aroma's and tastes, but you might choose differently ( or grab a bottle of wine :-) ).Hot food can be had from a variety of stalls and the FISH restaurant, but why go prepared food when you can grab a sandwich, and some nibbles for later?Very easy to get to from London Bridge tube stop (literally its across the street) and well worth the visit. Oh and the fish market seemed to be a hit with the kids, looking at all the fresh goods on ice."

We went by during our stay in London on a Saturday, and the place (the whole extent of it) was packed full of people - in some places such that you really had to just move with the flow of the crowd (you'll understand what I mean if you've ever experienced that). Without knowing much of what to expect, it was a slight surprise that there were many stalls that seemed permanent/semi-permanent, probably because the closest thing we have here to a 'market' is our local farmers market, which is only tents/canopies in a parking lot. As others point out, there's tons (probably literally) of food, with really good choices especially if you appreciate Italian options, and it seemed like there were many different artisanal cheese, meat, bread and pastry type foods available (not to mention the expected seafood, vegetables, etc). Personally, I purchased a panino (can't remember the vendor's name) which was very similar to those I've had in Italy, and my wife had a tomato-artichoke kind of salad (olive oil-based) which she loved, along with some kind of fruit smoothie (also delicious). Also New Forest ciders are there, which has its own separate review. I wasn't expecting too much of an experience in going there, but it was well worth doing, and different from everything else on our trip. Very easy to get to via the tube, and relatively close to other sightseeing options (e.g., Shakespeare's Globe theatre, Tate Modern, etc.). If we actually lived around the area, this would be a regular place to visit for us."

When I say packed, I mean it is seriously packed, and quite claustrophobic. But if you can get past that aspect, the selection is unbelievable, all the vendors were very nice, and you can pretty much eat anything and everything. Plus, just about everyone will let you sample their stuff first. All the bakeries were incredible, European bread is so much better than even artisan Californian bread. Oysters were fun and not overly expensive. Pies were to-die-for. Shaved cured pig was mouth watering. And the cheese / pate selection was the largest I'd ever seen in one place. I didn't even eat dinner I was so full the entire day. Go with a huge appetite, bring cash, and prepare to spend a couple hours there wandering around. Also a great farmers market if you're cooking at home, some incredible mushrooms and vegetables and exotic meats as well. Kangaroo meat? Zebra?"

Pricier than your general street food, but when we finally settled on a Venison burger (cooked right in front of us) and a smoothie (mixed right in front of us) (we split it for a total of 8UKP or about 11-12 USD), we were happy with our choice. A MUST to try some good English street food!"

Most vendors even let you try their food. I especially loved the organic cider, and the sweets. I had an amazing bread-and-butter-pudding. You should make sure to get there early because it got really busy when people from the surrounding offices came to get their lunch. Don't miss this, it is one of the nicest markets I have ever seen."

Free samples galore to taste before you buy. It can be a bit expensive but the quality is mostly very, very good. There are fish and fruit and veg you will have never seen before as well as amazing breads. It's not just for stuff to take home and cook, you can also have the most fantastic stand up lunch, many of the stalls sell both raw and cooked items if you can't wait until you get home and there are plenty of places for drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Nice part of London, you can see the Shard and the Golden Hind within a stone's throw. Highly recommended."

Such a wonderful variety of foods, wines, crafts, more foods. Every vendor was nicer than the last, each one wanted you to try their specialty, and we could not have enjoyed ourselves more. Take your time and be prepared to wait in line occasionally, but it will be worth it. The restaurants looked inviting, but we just stayed with the market. Easy to access by the double decker sightseeing bus. The courtyard at the Southward cathedral next door is a lovely place to sit and enjoy some of your goodies, too."

There's a church yard right next to the market, so the best idea is to pick up whatever you fancy to eat and take the 30 second stroll to the church yard to eat it - we had some British sausage baps and fresh iced (Earl Grey) tea with mint and lime - delicious.

Don't miss the licorice stall!Arrive early in the morning to avoid the crowds (we got there at 930 on a Saturday and it was fine). Bring a camera, there are some beautiful food displays. Bring some hand sanitizer to wash after the tube station."

If its breakfast time and you are feeling peckish check out Maria's cafe for a breakfast roll and mug of tea. Various fillings and hot drinks available - you can even have toast and marmalade if you want! Its reasonably priced and always busy!Or if it's later in the day why not treat yourself to a glass of prosecco as you are walking round?Borough Market is always buzzing but it can get a bit hectic around lunch time so expect lots of crowds if you are visiting around this time!"

A delicious lunch at a reasonable rate can be found at the Borough Market at the southern end of London Bridge in the south central section of London. A charming area along the Thames just next to the Southwark Cathedral offers an array of foods from England and beyond. Walking down the steps wafts of freshly cooked food drew us towards huge pans of paella and Catalan stew being prepared for the lunch crowd. Artisan breads & cheeses, raw Greek honey, fresh seafood, game, delicate slivers of ham from Parma. Fresh mushrooms and olives of every sort. Chocolates, cookies & brownies, eclairs and meringues....lovely! For lunch we went to the Kappacasein- the cheese man and ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and a small plate of boiled potatoes covered with creamy melted Raclette cheese accompanied by pickled onions and gherkins...THE BEST!

The market has an astounding variety of foods, both fresh and prepared, which reflect the cultural diversity of London and is a feast for the eye and palate. We went on a weekday and it was very crowded, so I imagine it could be crazy busy on a weekend. In the end I was so overwhelmed by the selection, that I had fish and chips for lunch (they were good but I wish I'd been more adventurous!) and my daughter enjoyed a delcious \"shredded salt beef and pickle\" sandwich. Afterwards, we treated ourselves to mouthwater raspberry and lavender goats milk ice-cream. Although there were lots of free samples to be had, they seemed to be mostly teeny tiny portions, so be prepared to buy something to eat. It's definitely worth a visit...."

Taking the short walk from the Station, to Borough Market, I was greeted by music, large numbers of people and the smells of some fantastic street vendors cooking up a whole range of tasty treats.  The place was packed, and maybe the only real down side, as you have to fight your way in to get to the stalls a little bit, but the vibe was amazing. Head to the centre and you will find several vendors selling cheeses and chutneys, burgers, sausages and a whole host of other goodies. We went to a vendor just off the centre, and I was told by my friend the sweet chilli chicken wraps were divine.............. and you know what............. they were. Best chicken wrap I have honestly ever had. All though the market isnt massive, it is busy, and with various pubs and eateries all around it, with the sun out its a great place to be. After you have bought your goodies, had a nibble or two, head towards the Anchor and finish the jaunt with a pint over looking the Thames. Wonderful."

We arrived around lunch time and it was mega busy so decided to pop to local pub for a warm and drink. When we returned the market was less crowded so was easier to negotiate. A fantastic place to visit if you love food. Talk to the traders they are full of incredible information. Take advantage of the samples. We had a fabulous salt beef sandwich for lunch. Purchased some bread, cheese and p\u00e2t\u00e9.Amazing displays of fish, fruit, vegetables and meat.Look out for the meringue display.Not a place to take a buggy.... Thoroughly enjoyed our visit but can't image what it would be like in the summer as it was so busy on a snowy day in March!"

Unlike Camden Market which is mainly Asian and Caribbean, this is almost entirely all European. Cheeses, fruits, breads, oils, everything. The stallholders are keen that you try all sorts of freebies, and they are excited to tell you all about where it comes from or how it is made.The location is great - just over London Bridge, and there was time for a quick look around Southwark Cathedral, and the Golden Hinde.An excellent afternoon."

There is a great atmosphere with a mixture of delighted tourists and serious food buyers, I fall into both categories when I visit as I cannot resist buying something new and different but I can also walk around for ages just staring at what is available. In adjoining streets there is also a great variety of shops selling cheese, chocolate, English wine etc, which incidentally is of exceptional quality."

OK, i'm not a tourist, but this is something we should support, so hopefully I can help make it a good experience.. You'll read many wonderful things about borough market here, so here are the practical bits! Best overland station is London Bridge - to get to the market you need to walk out by the Shard, then down the hill, keeping borough bar and all bar one on your left. When you get to the road, cross straight over at the lights and through the archway opposite, and that's the start of the market. If your coming by underground then head to Borough and you'll find it opposite you so. Best days to visit are thursday - saturday. I walk past them setting up at 08:30, and taking it down at 19:00, and they'll be open slightly later in the summer. It's best in dry weather but there are plenty of areas under cover just in case. If you go to http://www.boroughmarket.org.uk/ then you'll get the sales stuff but also useful things like a market map! From my perspective it's worth knowing they cater for all types, providing hot and cold food from paella through to legs of lamb and all the cheese varieties you can imagine and well worth nipping in for a browse. Best to take cash.. and lots of it if you're in a buying mood."

The market goes on and on, so wander fully before committing yourself! There are enormous pans of paella, fresh oysters and clams, raclette from Kappacasein, etc. etc. For those hunting English cheese, Neal's Yard is just outside the market across the street."

I got a plate of paella (\u00a36) too, but I could barely finish it because I was so full already; it wasn't that great so I didn't feel bad tossing a half eaten plate. I expected the produce here to be really pricey and while a lot were, there were good deals to be found. I got 3 containers of raspberries (probably 20 ounces total) for just \u00a31\u2014an amazing steal! Definitely stop by if you're in London.FYI: Bring cash.

So many choices of food to buy and eat freshly cooked you can try before you buy. Queues were long for the food stalls but well worth the wait. You can take your food and sit in the cathedral grounds to eat it, or eat on the go but too many other temptations ther! Had a glass of Cornish Sauvignon Blanc at the English wines stall in the street, was as good as any New Zealand Sav Blanc.Great atmosphere and very close to The Shard and the Golden Hind ship."

So many different sights, smells and tastes to experience, it's almost overwhelming.My favourite area was the one dedicated to all different types of cheese. With free samples of Vintage Comte being offered for our tasting pleasure. There was also an area dedicated to fresh produce where you can buy organic fruits and vegetables - including the biggest and most beautiful globe artichokes I have ever seen (and they are nearly impossible to find in UK supermarkets), an area for cured meats like salami and parma ham, an area full of tasty bread and cakes and enough international hot food to keep you full for a week.I myself was extremely happy to find a stall run by \"The Free From Bakehouse\", which sold a plethora of delightful gluten-free goodies. The Red Velvet cupcakes are exquisite, with icing that tastes of a delicious cheesecake. And the salted caramel bites were equally amazing. It was the best gluten-free pastry that I have ever tasted. I wish I could have them all the time!Lunch choices were abundant, whether you are happy to settle for a sandwich, want a freshly barbecued bratwurst, or fancy something more exotic like a kangaroo burger. And there were plenty of drinks to choose from too. We casually supped on a cup of hot freshly-pressed apple juice from Chegworth Valley farm, but if we'd wanted to, we could have also had some warm mulled cider or a freshly squeezed vegetable juice accompanied by a wheatgrass shot.If none of these choices appeal to you, there are also plenty of sit-down restaurants in the surrounding area. Including one which specialises in serving fresh oysters - ooh la la.My only tip would be to visit the market either early on a Saturday morning or during the week, because by the time we got there this Saturday lunchtime, it was absolutely heaving, and unless you are willing to wait a ten minutes or so, or push your way to the front (which I'm sure nobody reading Trip Advisor would ever do), you are not going to get a proper view of many of the stalls.Aside from that though, this is definitely a place that I would love to visit again. Next time at a better time of day though."

This place brings excitement, enjoyment & pleasure to food shopping. Whatever you want - herbs, spices, meats, world cheeses, artisan breads, chutneys, vast range of mushrooms,fruits, veg, exotic ingredients and the hard to find - its all here and of the highest quality. The stall holders are knowledgable & enthusiastic about their produce and more than happy to let you have a taste. The venue has recently reopened after refurbishment and is spilling over with atmosphere but very busy on the Saturday we visited. Even if you're not shopping, it's an interesting place to wander round. There are cooked food stalls to suit all tastes and budgets. For me it was a better experience than the BBC Good Food show. We can't wait to return - next time well bring a cool box to take produce home."

I stood in two of those queues, with great expectations: but the salt beef was dry and tasteless; the Cafe Brood fare was disgusting even though the people throwing it at us were hard working and eager.

Most of the stalls provide tasters of their produce, whether that is cheese , oils, paella or caribean cooking which gave it a food festival feel.The traders displays were stunning particuarly the fishmongers and the butchers.

            "review": "\"Full marks for the market\". The last, really comprehensive and quite excellent, food market I had been to was Barcelona's La Boqueria. And so, it was high time to give London's Borough Market a whirl. This I did last Saturday (26/01 ... Australia Day ... 225 yrs. and still going strong). First, I paid homage to my 'homeland's shore' by heading for Gamston Wood Farm's 'Ostrich & Exotic Meats' stall: I was keen to check out their Kangaroo Burger. It comes with mustard, mayo., cranberry sauce, caramelized onions & leaf salad for a very reasonable \u00a34.50. What ... no Vegemite?! They also do Kanga. sausages, Kanga. meatballs and Kanga burger meat to take home to cook on your Outback barbeque. And whilst you're at it, you could always stop-by one of the fresh fish & seafood stalls to get some Tiger Prawns to throw on it as well.On the one hand - and in it - you could get yourself a Duck Sandwich. On the other - and in it too - from Roast Hobbs, \"Pulled Pork\" with BBQ sauce and coleslaw. \u00a34.00, in a bap. How's that?! The portion sizes of virtually all of this 'street food' were handsome: good on the vendors. I witnessed a long, long, line of people snaking around a block on the market's fringe. I wondered if a box office must have been at the top end of the line, selling tickets for that night's performance of Cirque du Soleil. But no, they wanted a coffee from Monmouth. So what do you have to say about that, Starbucks? Hare and whole roe deer were on offer, that wonderful Nunez De Prado olive oil, vegetables galore, spices from exotic climes, artisan breads of many shapes & sizes, cheeses and cured meats from all over the place ... even lavender from Provence.We bought some ramekins featuring shellfish from original watercolours by Richard Bramble ...100 g. of finely hand carved Pata Negra from Brindisa ... and absolutely superb, fresh, Spinach Ricotta Tortelloni from La Tua Pasta. And had have we been going straight home, which we weren't, we would have stocked-up on a great deal more. As the morning progressed, the market got busier and busier. Lots of foreign tourists too. Doubtless why the market is being expanded. Made mental note: \" Get there earlier next time and leave when the amblers become a never ending train of humanoids\". So check-out the market's website: www.boroughmarket.org.uk/ and be sure to get your days & times right."

Unfortunately we had a busy day of sightseeing the day that we visited so we couldn't spend as long there as we wanted. We enjoyed every second of the time we spent there though. The sights, smell and people all left a lasting impression. We visited Harrods later that day and the pastries and vegetables there were much more expensive but didn't generally look a patch on what we had seen on some of the stalls / in some of the shops. Whilst the market is within spitting distance from London Bridge underground we walked there from St Paul's Cathedral by crossing over the Millennium Bridge and taking in sights such as the Globe Theatre and the Golden Hinde. It's a 15-20 minute walk so I'd only recommend it if you are fit and able to do so. We will definitely visit when we next visit London. Next time though we will be sure to spend longer there and do it on the day we are traveling home so that we can take all the delicious fresh produce home with us!"

A great food market selling a variety of breads, meats (including some pretty unusual ones), fruit & veg, fish, spices, chesses, cakes etc etc. The most difficult choice was deciding where to eat as there's so much choice - we opted for the Brindisa Chorizo Grill which sells only 1 thing - a chorizo sandwich, which is fantastic!If you are a bit sensitive about where your meat comes from (i.e. animals) then you may want to avoid the butchery area due to the animals hanging but either way, well worth a visit."

I really don't want to tell you about Borough Market but it is too late and the secret has been out for a couple of years now.This is the place for foodies and a great place to grab lunch for local workers. On Thursday and Friday at the end of the working day witness the phenomenon of pubs so full of city and local workers that they spill onto the street blocking the market street as they celebrate the end of the day and the end of the week with a pint. A great atmosphere.Don't be late when visiting as it is a working market and the stalls will close mid afternoon once the market gets quieter or they have sold all their produce. The market is not fully open on Monday and this is such a disappointment for me as when I am working in the area I always go to Brindisa for a Chorizo and red pepper sandwich. Mind you, sometimes it is a confit du canard sandwich at the French deli , or sometimes the roast pork sandwich at the Hog roast. The fruit juices and cider at the other stalls are worth buying to wash down your lunch. For dessert you need to wander over to the German stall for a nice big dessert and then off to another stall for your coffee. that is the thing about Borough Market - the way to enjoy it is to move from stall to stall choosing and eating your lunch as you go. A bit of this from here and a bit of that from there. That is the Borough way.This area is changing as with all of it's TV exposure over the years it is becoming a well known destination. I can see the change happening with more camera carrying tourists adding to the crowds.With the massive building works at London Bridge station and the building of the Shard tower block this area is in danger of disappearing into a sea of glass and chrome.The Southwark area is changing rapidly so visit Borough now in case the developers preserve this market by removing its taste and feel.Take a look at the guide books or websites to plan your visit as I am not sure of timings - i just know that I have been standing hungry and disappointed on a Monday wanting my Chorizo sandwich. Hmmm, reminds me of a song ........... \"Tell me why I don't like Mondays\".Don't worry, you won't go hungry as there is always something in the area to eat.Just one thing. Please, please, please don't tell anyone else it is where to go for the ultimate London Lunchtime food experience. It is hard enough to get through the crowds as it is!"

As I didn't know what your initial plan was, I decided to have a large breakfast to set me up for the day. Big mistake as we started off at Borough Market. This Market is simply amazing. There is such a diverse range of food available to eat there or to take home and enjoy later. To be honest, most of it is too good to wait for! All of the stall owners are very friendly and knowledgeable and willing to let you taste their produce. Unique stalls like the Drunk Cheese stall was quite intriguing, and the giant stack of brownies was amazing to behold. I would recommend the Borough Market to everyone of all ages and ethnicities and I would definitely recommend that you go there with a good appetite!"

From the greatest game pie I have ever tasted (courtesy of the pieminister stand), to wild boar sausages, to mulled wine made with proper spices not a mix packet from Shwartz, to a venison stick quite brilliantly described by the vendor as \"feral\".

I was tempted to rate it as average as the value for money ratio of the food on offer has really declined greatly, but its uniqueness as a venue has prevented me from doing so. I would suggest avoiding rainy days though, as there is really nowhere to stand (let alone sit), so you are likely to end up eating something under the cover of your own umbrella, dodging hundreds of other people doing the same - definitely not a nice experience. There is, however, a true vibrancy about this place, as well as a huge selection of the least known and more appetising foods from all corners of the world. So in the right weather conditions Borough market remains a very good alternative to places like Harrods or Selfridges Food Halls, with a more authentic feel to it."

Another \u00a38.25 for a sausage baguette?I wouldn't have minded but neither tasted that great. I visited on a Saturday that was raining and the roof of the railways was leaking like you would not believe, I had to use my umbrella under shelter! The area is really neglected and my friend said he saw a rat behind a stall.The place is full of camera tooting tourists and posh foodies that have more money than food sense.The sad fact is that better quality food at competitive prices can be found in Tesco\u2019s and Sainsbury\u2019s throughout the country.Shame it used to be such a genuinely lovely day out where good tasting food from rural areas could be obtained in the city for reasonable prices! Now it feels just a commercialised as walking into a Starbucks coffee house!!!!!"

If you want a good breakfast try Maria's Cafe in the centre - bubble and squeak fantastic. My favourites are Sillfield Farm for wild boar, Emilia Romagna for Parmesan (get the Vacca Rossa), Brindisa for good Chorizo, Piementon and iberico ham and Neals Yard for cheese. When you have had enough shopping, go the Old Thameside Inn for a drink and if the weather is nice sit outside overlooking the Thames."

It was fantastic and ended up buying tea, cheeses, vegetables, sauce .. would have bought more if we hadn't been walking round all day after that. We got there at about 10.45am after travelling from Leeds and it was just starting to get busy. We tasted lots of lovely bits and pieces and bought food from the stands for an early lunch - fantastic. Very interesting and lots of things I cannot get in Leeds. Even our 10 year old enjoyed it. By the time we left just before 12 noon it was packed though so I would advise go early - especially near Christmas. I will definately be going again when I got back to London at end of February ."

It has really grown now and can get really busy, but the atmosphere is still the same. I'd recommend going quite early on a Saturday to browse before all the crowds set in, then stick around and pick a stall for lunch!

It was heaving but the atmosphere was brilliant and it was hard to decide what to have for lunch!We settled on Pieminister and we were astounded. Top quality food at a very reasonable price! Washed down with hot cider, but I can't remember the stall name, sorry. We were stuffed but there were lots of delicious-looking fruits and cakes we would have liked to have tried if we'd had the time.The stallholders were very jovial and the place was bustling with life. Excellent photo opportunities and so much fantastic choice. The only negative I would say is that there is little space to sit and eat your food so occasionally you do get knocked and jostled whilst trying to enjoy your pie!"

At 18pds entry we gave this a miss and wandered along the Southbank riverside taking in the delightful stalls of handicrafts, street performers and foodd stalls.With a mulled wine to warm our hands (and stomachs) we carried on down to Blackfriars bridge and towards the Golden Hind, tucked between higgh rise modern buildings.Just behind it we found Borough market where we enjoyed the busy atmosphere and sampled the many cheeses, breads and condiments from around the world.It's a great place to grab a sandwich, freshly cooked, or something more substantial - fissh and chips, paella and all sorts of exotic sausages. All washed down with speciality beers, ciders or even mulled cider.It's a friendly place to wander around and taste London life at it's best."

I love Borough Market for two reasons, One the wonderful choice of food available from the stalls and two the nature of the stall holders and their ability to make you smile, however the market is as much a tourist attraction as it is a place to shop now and is becoming increasingly busier and a less attractive place to visit to pick up lovely food.The challenge is getting the balance right and at the moment this is just not happening, building work on the sight is not helping also. Please take out a few stalls to make a bit of space for the customer to be able to move from stall to stall without getting crushed.Good place to shop and I see the attraction for the tourists but not at the loss of business from loyal customers surely?"

The market consists of several parts: a number of permanent stalls selling wine, cheese, organic produce and goods imported from other parts of Europe; carts selling local produce, artisan foods, take-away meals and sweets; several side streets and alleys featuring gourmet shops and restaurants, as well as the enormous Vinopolis wine museum, which was closed when we went there; and a new market hall that was still under construction during our visit.We spent a while wandering around Borough Market before buying anything. We scoped out the numerous wine shops and tried a sample of amazingly delicious Zamorano cheese paired with quince jelly at Brindisa, a lovely shop specializing in Spanish food. By then, we had worked up an appetite. One of the seafood stalls at Borough Market featured three enormous woks filled with freshly made paella, Thai curry and a Vietnamese stir-fry. All three were made with the same seafood, and perhaps their theme was international rice-based dishes. They were all incredible, and, despite looking almost identical, very authentic tasting. It was a tough decision, we settled on the paella along with some falafel and freshly-squeeze juice from nearby stalls. It was pure lunch perfection, made even better with the addition ginger fudge for dessert.Borough Market is ideal for those of us whose idea of the perfect afternoon is looking at, tasting and smelling various kinds of gourmet food. You can\u2019t spend a whole day there, but it\u2019s a great lunch stop along the way to the Tate Modern, Globe Theatre and other South Bank attractions."

Being real foodies and having rented an apartment in Shad Thames on a recent London visit, we visited this market to shop for produce so we could cater in some of the meals. We were absolutely enchanted by this sprawling market set out under the old brick railway arches , with a fabulous atmosphere and exceptionally friendly stall holders . The choice of fresh produce was eye popping, a fish counter which had us confused with the wide range of choice , a rainbow of fruit and vegetables with mushroom varieties I've never seen before , delicious baked goods , all sorts of sausages and meats from around the world . Most stall holders had tasting plates and were very happy to impart knowledge without pushing for sales. The market has some very nice and trendy shops on the periphery and the atmosphere is just great ! The juxtaposition of the new Shard building from behind the market with the old antiquated market buildings makes for a wonderful pic . There are several great spots to eat street food, our favourite were the salt beef sandwiches with pickles and lashings of mustard . This market is held every Thursday, Friday and Saturday with the very best produce on display on Thursday which is the best day to go for seeing everything looking pristine but if you're after bargains go on Saturday afternoon when the stall holders put in a special pitch to sell off remaining produce with friendly amusing banter at knockdown prices ."

You can spend an entire afternoon just browsing the wide range of stalls, and if you're looking to buy a gift it's the perfect place. They have stalls selling all sorts of home made and artisan goods, with stallholders from all over the world. It's an absolute must if you are a cheese fan, and the cupcakes and brownies are out of this world!"

I used to work in a Pub around the corner from this market in the 90's and it was still in operation but just a market.They have put a ton of money into rejuventing this area and is definately worth walking through the market. There are many vendors with food, drinks, organic items a great place to stop for lunch which touring London. This market goes back hundreds of years and there are many little pathways leading into and through the market which are amazing! I was so pleasantly surprised by the area and the offerings I went back the next day. It is also right by London Bridge tube station, and the newest building The Shard.Take a walk around the whole area and experience old London, then walk down to the embankment along the river. What a great day!"

To explain a little further I need to mention that Borough Market attracts artisan food producers and providers from across Europe. Fish, game, mushrooms, pies, vegetables, cheeses, breads, butter, raw milk, continental and north african foods, wines, ciders, hot chorizo in a roll, french sea salts, herbs, spices, teas, cordials, dips and marinades, the list goes on. Stalls vary somewhat from time to time, and there are definitely fewer on a Thursday than on Friday and at the weekend.Expect it to be busy on Fridays with lots of City workers in addition to holidaymakers and visitors. Close to the river, the City with all its history, including the Tower of London, the Monument and so on, the market is right beside Southwark Cathedral as well.Look out for the Ubriaco cheese....heavenly!"

If you have any interest in food, I can highly recommend Borough Market.The Market has a long history, having been established at the south end of London Bridge in Medieval times when the Bridge was the sole crossing of the River Thames.The location is hugely atmospheric, being held partly in the Victorian glazed Market Hall beneath the railway viaduct; framed on one side by Dickensian buildings and narrow streets, and on the other by the magnificent Southwark Cathedral, which is worth a visit in its own right. Nowadays the Market has re-invented itself as a Gourmet's paradise. Great British food, meat, fish, fruit and veg, cheeses and more, as well as unusual imports from Europe and beyond. Plenty of places to buy takeaway snacks too - this is probably one shopping trip you should make BEFORE you eat!OK the prices are sometimes expensive. But you are paying for quality. And just browsing costs nothing. Open Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with extra openings in the run-up to Christmas - check the website for details. With all the festive produce this is a particularly delightful time to visit."

You have to go on an empty stomach as there is tasters and stalls with so much you want to try. Sadly we had no fridge were we were staying or we would have bought some of the lovely cheese to take home with us. If you do have tasters from the stall holders please make sure you thank them we saw so many people taking food and not saying anything. The market is easy to access from London Bridge tube station and you get a great view of the Shard thrown in for free. There are even a couple of nice pubs nearby if you need to sit down and have a liquid refreshment to fortify you to start walking round all over again!I recommend going about 10am before it gets too crowded (the market not the pub!)."

I am happy for the vendors that they were doing such good business but I much preferred our first, quiet visit.Even so, we had lovely sandwiches and bought some delicious bread and cheese to enjoy back our English relatives' home.

The food on the stalls is fantastic and the smells hit you round every corner.If you want fresh food this is it at it's best. Somethings may be pricey but you get what you pay for and a lot of food here isn't readily available in other places. The alcohol stalls sell drinks made locally and specialist stuff. I go to a stall called The Spice Mountain it sells a wide variety of spices, chillies and the like.There are also some restaurants in the market but they are expensive. Why not try the many cafes scattered amongst the little streets.I wouldn't recommend going if you are hungry, there really is too much temptation."

It gets horrendously crowded, and you can spend a king's ransom, but the food is invariably excellent. You can buy high quality raw vegetables, bread, meat and fish, cakes and chocolates, and great street food. In the roads around the market are excellent specialist shops, too, like Neal's Yard Dairy for cheese."

Our first stop: the iconic Borough Market at the foot of London Bridge. A testimony to London's diversity; its being a capital of world culture and a celebration of home industries still being truly alive albeit surviving the invasion by giant supermarket chains.Truly a feast to all senses. Shopowners are very generous in serving you their tasters - which could fill up your stomach by the time you finish your round. The wholesale market operates on all weekday mornings from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m but the retail market operates only on Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Fridays from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The market, which has focused historically on fruits and vegetables, has in recent years added stalls dealing with the fine food retail market. Borough Market has become a fashionable place to buy food. It has been promoted by British television chefs and has been used as a film set. The Borough Market is also a good starting point for a walk long the embankment from the London Bridget till the South Bank - with lot of historical and touristic attractions along the way - including the Clink Street, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, the Tate Modern and the South Bank."

Having had a lovely brunch at the Swan at the Globe, with the added attraction of the London Olympic Flame going past the window on the Royal Barge Gloriana (ok maybe you won't get that, but it's the South bank so you never know what might be going on!) We strolled around the corner by the replica of the Golden Hinde to Borough Market. What a gem! We arrived at lunchtime so the market was packed with Business types mixing with tourists and just plain local shoppers.The first sight was the crowd of people spilling out of \"the Market Porter\" pub and thronging into the road. No novelty stalls here, it's about food and drink. When we arrived there were queues of people buying their lunches fish and chips, veggie specialities, great paella dishes bubbling away, a variety of hot and cold cooked meats from quite spectacular burgers, up to and including Ostreich and Camel! We decided not to queue up but let the lunchtime crowds die down a little and walk around first and view the various markets and stalls before choosing. Lets face it you do not want to carry produce around if you do not have to. However you have to be a little careful if these are fresh goods that they can sell out.when it came to eating my wife had a veggie option, not my cup of tea but that she must have liked as she kept say to me try this! Did I mention the stalls selling loose teas? I had 4 large oysters which he pulled from a large insulated box and opened for me. All i added was a little chilli sauce and some lemon juice. I was surprised as they turned out to be both the biggest and the best oysters I have ever tasted!!! All this was washed down with some Real Cider from the New Forest Cider company. We move just a few feet outside and sat on the benches in the courtyard of Southwark Cathedral in the sun to enjoy them and agree what stalls we would return to for our produce which was Bread, Chutney, Cheese and Wine. Not to say the meats and wet fish, mushrooms and vegetables, Beers didn't look tempting. The cheese came from the fantastic selection at the wonderful cheese shop Neal's Yard at the market entrance, worth a trip on it's own. With whole cheeses up to the roof and at least a dozen staff serving. Glad we took a back pack containing a couple of cool bags with those ice block things to be sure we would ge them home on the train in top condition.Oh we bought a hessian bag with Borough Market on to satisfy your Tourist tendancies! The sights (lots of people taking photographs) the smells and the sounds, (including the trains going overhead make this a delight to visit. We will probably do the same again as part of a trip to London rather than a single purpose trip but we will return without a doubt. If not before definately to for some Christmas food."

Firstly, this is not an East End type street market but a real foodie place specialising in the organic, high-end type of stuff, with prices and juuuust occasionally a bit of pretension to match. Having said that, the food quality here is fantastic, with small producers that you just won't find anywhere else and some very knowledgeable people behind the stalls. Half the fun is just wandering around sampling things, great coffee from Monmouth, cheeses from Neals Yard, etc. The meats and fish are amongst the best I've bought in London, and the market site is an attraction in itself with its old arches under the train tracks; in fact there's been a market here since Roman times. Go early to beat the Boden-clad crowds, wander about, talk to the traders, sample stuff, breakfast on a hot dog or hot chorizo sandwich or splash out at Roast. Or go later and grab a pint at the Market Porter. A tip for tourists: the Market makes a great start to a Saturday and is just off the South Bank walk that takes in a landmark or three."

Located just off the London Bridge tube station, the market is open Thursday-Saturday and boasts a wide variety of food and drink stalls. To put it bluntly, it\u2019s a foodie heaven. I didn\u2019t know where to start, but after a proper wander around, I felt right at home. From massive curries, to colorful juices, and alcoholic beverages, it\u2019s hard not to leave Borough Market stuffed to the gills.Tip: While by Borough Market, don\u2019t forget to stop by Southwark Cathedral, the oldest Gothic church in London and walk a good five blocks to snap the requisite photo of yourself by Tower Bridge (not to be confused with the less exciting London Bridge)."

The chorizo burgers are fantastic, the pies are great, lots of cheese. wine, dessert - everything you can ask for they have it there. Wind down with coffee at Monmouth.

You can choose all sorts of specialty foods from the market. Cheese, bread, meat, vegetables and fruit, seafood, sweet treats to name a few. I was delighted to find some Truffle Oil and it was delicious in a salad. I was also impressed with a small coffee shop across from the market as its coffee is the best around. There was a large wooden table in the centre of the cafe with breads and jams on the table. You can drink your coffee with bread and jam. Wonderful. But you had better get in quick, this cafe is very popular and unfortunately I never got a seat. Instead I drank my coffee standing up. It was worth it."

(So not too hard on the old teeth!) My husband was a bit disappointed with his meal which was mash and gherkins with melted cheese over the top. We bought some lovely brownies and those really fresh green olives which didn't last very long! We also bought some cheese which WAS very tasty but I thought it was quite expensive. I would definitely return regularly when we are in London. It is a very interesting part of the capital and actually I think it is my favourite now. Right on the Thames and near The Globe Theatre.

The olives are to die for! Fresh produce is stellar and if you're a lover of sea foods, this is the place for you. Giant North Sea prawns,urchins,crab similar to Fl stone crabs,oysters and tons of fish..what a selection. Juices, jellies, jams, meats, cheeses, nuts,herbs, sweets...all amazing. The take away foods are wonderful! FISH,(it's name) take out fish & chips. Choose your type of fish, huge portions of golden, perfectly fried fish UNDER 10 pounds! My favorite, Hobbs Meats!! :) Lots of roast meat sandwiches! The rolls are delicious pick your flavor (meat) and dress it. Faves, the salt beef (corned beef to you Americans) and the pork w/stuffing & apple!!!!! I grab one for the plane, infinitely better then the airlines options.Generally rent a flat when I'm here & this is where I go to stock my fridge.If you go early & I mean early, you'll see several of London's top chefs doing their shopping! I can't go to London without stopping here!"

If I lived in London, I would go every week to stock up on fresh produce and fish, plus some primo cheese and other goodies. I saw cuts of beef and lamb that I had never seen not heard of before. The slabs of cheese from all over Europe were fun to sample and buy. Lots of variety in every category. If you were in London and planning a dinner party, this is where you could pick-up all of the premium ingredients. The street food options combine with the more established stalls and stores to create a spralling and wonderful foodie experience tucked away in a mazelike setting that is hard to describe. I had some Caribbean fish Curry to begin with and ended with a duck confit sandwich that I will never forget. Pies, ham slices, cheeses, sausages and some ales were squeezed in along the way. The selection of Italian cheeses and hams was spectacular and the prices were a decent value, even for pricey London. Lots of friendly shop keepers and food \"pushers\" made the experience even better. If you are into food, this is a \"must do\" in London."

There is food, but not just food, mountains of food! Think pyramids of brownies, stacks of cheese, baskets of bread and just plain loads of everything delicious.I would begin with finding one of the tiny cafe style restos inside and starting your visit off with a proper English breakfast (get there early as they fill up fast).Then begin your peruse aisle by aisle and I guarantee you'll be delighted at what you see and taste and smell. There's a flower vendor outside the market, in one of the skinny streets, where you'll find tall tins and pots of flowers overflowing on the sidewalk.\"The Borough\" as that part of town is loveingly named, is a great part of London, serviced by both Borough and London Bridge tube stations.

I cannot remember the exact name of the stall - Kappacassein I think...We had to choose between that or Raclette flame melted cheese over potatoes. The sandwich was huge, but we all ate until we thought we would burst because it was sooo good! We saw people eating salads, soups, meat pies, all kinds of delicious stuff. There seemed to be a lot of local people on their lunch breaks. Afterwards we walked around and bought treats to eat later, then wandered the surrounding area - very quaint, before hitting the Tube as the rain started. If you like fresh, delicious food this is a fun place. Guide books called the prices high, but we did not find it to be expensive. The vendors were all friendly and welcomed me to take photos!"

Now, I can't imagine a trip to London without stopping by for a favorite falafel, brownie or banofee pie. Imagine booth after booth of artisan breads, ethnic specialties, sweets, bakery goods, grass-fed and organic meats and every kind of hot food you can fathom. My only regret in writing this review is that more London tourists will visit what is now my favorite lunch spot in the city!"

We stumbled upon Borough Market quite by accident a few years ago and we never feel a visit to Londonis complete without a stop at this thousand-year-old market. Borough is large and a bit sprawling with a huge variety of bread, cheese, meat and other vendors, along with prepared foods. Most offer samples, which helps you make an informed decision about what to buy or eat. We normally take a full turn through the various sections before deciding what to have for lunch - a salted (corned) beef sandwich or lamb and mint burger from Northfield Market, or perhaps a kangaroo burger from the place across from the cider vendor. Try the duck comfit sandwiches. Most dishes are between four and six pounds. Might be difficult to find a place to eat but there is often open seating in the yard of the Souhwark Cathedral which abuts the market.Have some warm New Forest cider in winter months or some nice cold scrumpy or cider in spring or summer to wash down the lunch. There is also pressed orange juice, which is quite nice and a little different - the pressing process delivers more oils from the orange peels, resulting in a slight bitterness and intensified orange essence.Once you have eaten, then, and only then should you shop for a dinner or picnic. If you do this while hungry you run the risk of needing to hire a sherpa to carry your purchases. As mentioned before, there is a huge selection of breads and cheeses, olives, and preserved meats from biltong to chorizo to potted game ( including partridge, hare and pigeon), along with sweets of various types, from brownies to turkish delights to cheesecakes.Need a little something for a friend? Every berry or fruit in the fruit in the UK is present in a preserve or jam and sold here - along with raw and regional honeys."

Brought over from the Kiwi's its something like a latte only way less foam. Next make your way into the Jubilee Market section inside and find Flour Power for a pastry, my fav is Almond Croissant. Then snake your way through all the booths and nibble all their samples. Cheese, jams, cured meats, oils....it's all good! Then go through Middle Row and pick up a Meat Pie or some seafood or Paella. Green Market has by far the most variety. There you'll find the incredible grilled cheese sandwiches hear the backside at Kappacasein. Split a sandwich, they're super filling and go sit in the Southwark Cathedral. Have fun!"

Many of the unique foods are ethnic and/or organic, from small purveyors. The foods on offer to eat are just delicious - but the absolute best sandwich in the market is the toasted cheese sandwich at Kappacasein. They use Poilane sour dough bread and a mixture of several cheeses then grill it in a sandwich press. Near the end of grilling it, they add a mixture of garlic, onions and leeks and add a little more of the cheese, then grill it a bit longer. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! They also serve a raclette, which is roasted potatoes smothered in warmed raclette cheese. It smelled wonderful, but I always go for the toasted cheese sandwich.

We're both chocoholics, and the excellent eating and drinking chocolates from the Artisan du Chocolat stall would alone be worth the visit. Jeff is still savoring their fabulous hot chocolate. There are also wonderful artisan breads, delicious pastries, fruits, vegetables, and meats galore, including cuts and varieties rarely seen stateside. It all makes for a fascinating and fun show.

The choice for lunch is also staggering and on a nice day it's great to eat in the grounds of the old church next door. HOWEVER... It is not the borough market of old and has lost a great deal of its authenticity and become a lot more commercial. Many of the traders are getting fed up with what they see as money grabbing management, and the overly touristic nature of the place. Most of their regulars are leaving/have left which makes the traders unhappy as they feel in their words 'like monkeys in a zoo' when their pictures are snapped 24/7. Past 10am, most of the serious local shoppers are usually gone, leaving only grazing tourists to wander around snapping photos and nibbling bits and pieces.If you want the 'real' London market experience and to avoid the crowds, either go early on Saturday morning or go on Friday. If you do happen to be there around lunchtime, I cannot talk highly enough about the fish wrap located outside Applebee's the Fishmonger. Delicious!It also helps to chat to the local traders - you will find most of them very welcoming and if you are a tourist reading this, I think both of you will appreciate the interaction.But because of the crowds, I only go there for one or two things early Saturday morning now. Most people \"in the know\" now go to the break away market on Maltby street under the railway bridge which is a lot more of a relaxed affair and a genuine experience. I would say both are worth checking out although tourists will probably get more out of a trip to Borough as it is MUCH larger than Maltby and there is more to keep them entertained. As a shopper, though, I now prefer Maltby - even though it is in its early days."

You can see why all the foodie types and TV chefs head here, it's everything you'd imagine a Dickensian food market to be, but like Dickensian Christmasses it's almost a total fake; but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.For me La Boqueria in Barcelona is the greatest market for food, but Borough Market although smaller comes close. I had the kids and Ex in tow and we wandered around for hours, and although could have spent \u00a3100 and not regretted it, spent relatively little. That is the beauty of any market, the pleasure is wandering around. You can spend your entire money purse or - as we did - buy a couple of nice ingredients for relatively little and then make a meal at home later.If you read all of the reviews here, they're all correct - everyone has their own point of view, but given that it can cost you nothing, you have nothing to lose by going along and having a look. Just beware the game/butchery stalls though, my daughter was going through a veggie phse and there's a lot of blood and guts on display."

Take time to visit the Southward Cathedral which is right beside it and free to enter. We arrived via London bridge but walked back on the Southbank of the river (so the side of the river where the market is). Well worth walking back this way and through the small streets. Within less than 10 mins you are at the Globe theatre and a short stroll on you are at the Tate Modern, or cross the Millennium bridge and you are back at St.Pauls Cathedral.

The market itself is so much fun to walk around, eat samples happily handed out by vendors and treat yourself to an amazing coffee at Monmouth (but beware the line!). I enjoy talking to the vendors, most of whom are actual farmers or artisans who drive in from all around the UK to sell their products at Borough.I have found that the earlier I get there (it opens at 8 on Saturday, later on Thurs and Friday) the better my experience is. As the crowds descend on the area it gets more and more difficult to navigate the area and can grind ones nerves a bit. Once you have filled up on the food be sure to explore the area around Borough which includes the Golden Hind Ship Museum (replica of Sr Francis Drake's ship he used in discovering CA, etc.) and Clink, a great museum on the spot of England's oldest prison dating back to the 1100's. Other attractions are the scenic walk along the Thames, The Globe theatre as well as the more gory and teenage-packed London Dungeon. Another fun highlight is the George Inn, five minutes walk from the market and one of England's oldest pubs and saw patrons including The area is a fun and exciting place to explore, easily accessible from Jubilee Line, London Bridge stop, and taste of how London really used to be!"

The food includes: meat of every imaginable kind, fruit and vegetables, olives, cheeses, olives, oil, bread, cakes, sweets/chocolates, yogurt, wine, ... and the list goes on. The crowds are intense and queuing for some food is inevitable, but worth the wait. Probably good idea to bring a strong bag if you intend to shop - as the small plastics and paper bags are hard to manage if you keep buying ... and buying seems addictive."

I know, I know everyone says it about Borough Market, but since Kappacasein were gone from the market for a while, the good news is that as of November (maybe they came back in October?) 2011, they are back! They really are the best toasted cheese I've ever had! People tell me the raclette is great, I wouldn't know, I only have eyes for the toasted cheese. But seriously, it's NOT all that Borough is about... they have an amazing array of food there, if you're looking for eat and go, there are a range of foods, and if you're looking for take home and cook... well, you're in for a treat. The place isn't overpriced either, not for the quality on offer. The fruit and veg is always seasonal, and often from the grower. I have to confess while the Kappa folk were off, I was stuck so I strayed and tried the fantastic grilled haloumi sandwiches from the place at the foot of the stairs... has to come a close second in any market food I've ever eaten.

There are a lot of stores selling cheese and wine too..overall experience is alright but not fantastic like other markets such as Brick Lane"

When planning, though, know that it is only open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays (some peripheral shops and restaurants are open daily).There is no end to the delights on offer - duck snadwiches, fabulous pies (game, lamb and apricot, venison, for example) cheeses, hams, meats (we bought the tastiest lamb we have ever eaten), fish, fruit and vegetables, wine, olive oil and everything else a gourmet could dream of.I love food markets and the only rival to Borough Market that I have been to is La Boqueteria (?) in Barcelona.Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.

We went on Saturday morning September 17 to get some provisions and were blown away at the selection of items and quality. We bought fresh veggies, beer, wine, eggs,meat pies, desserts and jams. We went about 9:00 AM and spent about 3 hours there. Its gets very busy after 11 and the crowds were substantial. My only complant is the Market is only open Thurs-Sun with many of the stalls open Sat-Sun and we cant shop there everyday!"

This market is lovely, charming, delightful, but sadly not a lot in the fruit and veg dept, although that seems to be a way of life in the UK. I loved it oh so much but wanted oh so much more out of it, having been spoiled by markets in other cites. Yes, it's a foodie haven in otherwise foodie barren London. I'm not saying the food in London is bad, it's not, it's just missing a lot of what I've gotten in other cities and countries. And I'm not saying I've tried every nook and cranny in London, I haven't, and I'm not saying this market isn't good. I'm saying that for a market in London this is like heaven and if you are visiting and don't get to see/experience this place you are missing out on one of the most fantastic experiences London has to offer. Not only did we see fabulous butchers galore, but cheeses to die for (DO NOT FORGET NEIL'S YARD SHOP!!!), ethnic stuffs, and hard cider right out of the cask that will knock your knickers off!!! (I'm not kidding, mind yourself here, it's powerful stuff). Go here and eat the brauts, munch on an empanada (Argentine-style), eat baklava and ice cream and try the treacle fudge. Then walk, walk, walk to find that blasted tube station - a good calorie burn. Or better yet hit a pub and enjoy the local color."

Some shops and most restaurants are open throughout the week and there are quite a few good restaurants to try out (Brindisa tapas, Roast which has a great view of the market, Wright Brother which specialises in fish, etc).Borough market has has something for any foodie.

The stalls are far too numerous in variety and quantity, but suffice to say - if its food related then they'll have it here. The fish in particular was really spectacular. We bought olives, cheeses, fruit and a game pie for a little picnic lunch by the river. Brilliant place to spend 30-60 mins wandering round and exploring. The stallholders were all very friendly too.

You'll end up standing in a line anyway: if there is a line at one stall, they're everywhere and probably worth the wait.

We sampled a big array of things, cheeses, dressings, oil, meats, pate, bread - the list goes on. There are also plenty of hot food stalls where you can have lunch. We opted for a lovely catalonian stew with paella - absolutely fresh and delicious at under 7 pounds per head. There are some seating areas were you can sit and have lunch. We arrived just before 11am on a Saturday and it was still OK to wander round, not too busy. We popped into the pub at the entrance for a drink and afterwards went back for another wander at around 1.30pm - by this time it was extremely busy and quite difficult to make your way through the crowds - so the earlier you can visit the better. If you are in the least bit interested in cooking or food this market is a must to experience. We'll be back for sure - next time with a cool bag and ice pack so we can buy more cheese from O'Neil's Cheese shop at the entrance. This market is a wonderful way to spend a Saturday morning."

We wish we lived closer as there was great veg and fish as well. We did spend quite a bit - well you do pay for quality ! But we had a great few hours there - very full, very tired, very laden down with shopping and wet through we returned home with our wonderful wares! You must go and take large shopping bags."

I was amazed at all that I saw and appreciated the open market feel and the personal touches of each stand. There is great variety - everything from German to Indian to organic even. It was my first time going to a market in England, let alone an open air market all together. I was starving, not having had lunch at 3 p.m. I decided to try the home range chicken burger for 3.50, which was just about the most right choice I could have made; I loved it and the bread/bun it was in it was something else. I continued to admire the cakes on display, buying myself a slice of cheesecake for 2.50 from a place that had such great variety! I even bought chocolates from the West Indies, which had caramel and was made of crepes according to the label; not the cheapest, but it was amazing what selection there was. It seems like this would be a great place to grab a quick bite to eat if you're passing by; but then again I'm not a local so maybe once you've goten used to the selection there then you aren't amazed. This place reminds me of the St. Lawrence Markets back home in Toronto. I definitely recommend you visit the Boroughs for yourself!"

Pick up lunch at the wonderful curry stand - serving 3 types of curries (when we went, Thai seafood in green curry, Caribbean, and Vietnamese) out of huge vats, for 5 pounds over rice or 7 pounds for a large portion w/ rice (it's worth it!).

Come one Come all.Foodie or not - you can't pass a visit to Borough Markets when you come to London.For those on a very tight budget then how about a free lunch with the freshest of ingredients? Simple, most stalls have samples for all to try. Try 1 or try 4 pieces from your favorite stall(s) and before you know it you'll be full. Just bring a bottle of water with you.For those of us that live there or visiting it's a great place to get your fresh produce, meat, dairy, juices or lunch on the run. Actually we've picked up alot for picnics.This will take at least half your day. Best to visit first thing in the morning otherwise it'll get very busy come lunchtime.Toasted sandwiches? Just have one. You'll see why.Here is my video of these guys: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yorf6BERSogFor a deeper insight on this Market here is a thread which will go through many of our favorites and what not to miss: http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g186338-i17-k3624244-Borough_Market-London_England.html"

Lots of great things to look at at and taste, as well as some good people watching. We had hoped to stop by again before leaving London (for another toasted cheese!) but sadly did not make it.

Whatsmore, on many stands they\u00b4ll give you tasters of whatever they\u00b4re selling. Even though many are saying that it\u00b4s open only on Fridays and Sats, I\u00b4ve just returned from London and I went to the market 3 times: on Thu, Fri and Sat. Maybe a local can bring us more information on this."

Only small but packed to brim with different fresh produce, from variety of countries including home grown. We got there Saturday afternoon and packed. Lots of stalls offering hot foods and we decided to have our lunch there eating out side the cathedral. Great food and atmosphere."

This was my first London experience..coming straight from the airport, we just got off the tube at \"London Bridge\" station, tired and having jet lag. We had no idea where we were..we just started walking into the market..and VOILA ! Refreshed, awed, shocked, amazed. It was Friday morning and there were sausages and pates and cheese everywhere! And people offered us sample after sample. The paradise for the gourmands, for food-lovers everywhere.The market is a rainbow of smells, sights and colors. We saw rabbit, deer, sushi, sea food...everything! So colorful!But the BEST part -the Market Porter Pub which is close to the market (or part of it?). Fri at noon, hundreds of people in business attire were standing in front of the pub (not inside) with pints of beer in hand. This was lunch hour at Borough Market. Who wouldn't fall in love with the place...We came back 2 more times, first on Fri night, just after closing time..watching huge Bristish boys take down the displays and then ending up in the pubs, on the streets (again hundreds of drunk people)...second on Sun morning (but there was nothing -the market was closed). If Zola described the French Les Halles in his books (as you know, they're not as in the books anymore)..I believe it;s Borough market that made me understand what he meant. This must have been the atmosphere. Go there.."

So much to see and sample. It is not easy to decide from among the many, wonderful choices, but do pick a few items to make up a tasty lunch. Or just wander through and enjoy the atmosphere. And then check out the next door Southwark Cathedral for a few minutes of real peace and serenity."

There are lots of samples on offer (try the Green Market for this) and you can't beat eating a freshly made lunch on the grass outside of Southwark Cathedral. There are also a huge amount of other things to see in the area so you can easily spend the whole day wandering. For a more detailed review - check out [--]."

I spent an hour or two at the Borough Market, mostly searching for the main market itself -- before I realized that the few stalls and booths I saw were all that I was going to find. I couldn't believe how few vendors were present and how limited was the selection of foods and restaurants in the area. A small group of vendors clustered together under a bridge, with a few nearby, touristy restaurants. That's it. Not worth a special trip across the Thames."

If you get to the Tower on a Friday and you have some time, walk acorss the Bridge to the South side (opposite from the Tower of London side) for lunch. On the right hand side of the road down a small side street you will find the most amazing food market which opens up with all sorts of cuisine. They cook their wares for you so that you can try them. It's Fabulous! If I'm planning a trip to London I will always do it on a Friday!! It's called Borough Market. Bon Apetit!"
