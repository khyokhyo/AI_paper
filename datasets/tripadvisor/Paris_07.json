The gallery is so beautiful and the Water Lily's are so absolutely breath taking it is easy to overlook the fantastic collection of Impressionist art downstairs. I ran straight up the ramp to the Monet masterpieces, but my tip would be to start downstairs, then go up to the two galleries. We went for a re-visit and sat down with the Lily paintings. It was crowded, but there were moments when the crowds parted and you feel some alone time in both rooms. Monet was lucky he got to design how his masterpieces would be displayed and they look magnificent! Do not miss downstairs though. Talk about right time and place for getting into art dealing."

There is a lift to the other floors and collection in the Museum for those with difficulty managing stairs. There is also a cafe and souvenir shop on the lower level. Many beautiful paintings by Renoir, Monet, Picasso and a number of painters are displayed on the lower floor. Nice area with seating,to sit outside the building and have a picnic ."

I bought tickets on line in advance (Parisinfo.com) and picked them up at Paris Info on Blvd des Pyramides (not far from the Louvre). This gives you priority entry. It did not matter much, I went on a Friday afternoon and just about had the place to myself. This museum was some fabulous Impressionist paintings, without the super crowds of the Musee d'Oursay (yes, I went there too, but the crowds give me a headache). I highly recommend this museum. Since it is small it can be done in a short period of time (or longer if you choose). It is located in the Tulleries so it is a great walk to and from the museum."

We did the audio tour of the paintings and found it to be very informative without being overwhelming. It took us about three hours to see the art and learn more about the artists. Although we were tired when we left, we were glad that we had made this visit a priority. The only downside was the staff letting people take pictures and pose for selfies. Give this place a try.

There are two whole rooms dedicated to Monet's water lillies and you can sit in the middle of the room and feel like you are in his garden in Giverny. It is a rather small gallery and very accessible - definitely worth putting on your Paris itinerary!"

            "review": "More Than Monet. It was a spur of the moment decision to visit the museum as my husband and I strolled along the Seine. There was no line up to speak of and we were able to take our time with the grand Monet canvasses. We sat on the benches in the centre of the room and waited for the moving crowds to allow for the view. My husband takes photos but I do not when viewing art unless it is a piece of art that I would not likely find easily online. I do find the constant picture taking so disturbing to the nature and intent of this art installation. Some of my discontent is likely borne of the approach I take to viewing art but most of the people I saw walked up close and took a photo and walked away. But they paid the same as I did and they can do as they please. I did appreciate when the guards would call for silence but some guards made more of an effort than others to keep the noise level down. The art on the lower floor is a nice bonus and allows for a look at art that is less often seen in an intimate space. But again that same intimacy can cause a problem. There was a tour guide who would take over the space in front of an art work and although she had a microphone and her poor followers had ear pieces she could be heard throughout the room. All well and good if she were any good but I had to bite me tongue not to leap to the defense of an artist when she made grave errors and kept inserting her opinions, which held no merit for me. She must rely on the people who pay for her time not being well versed enough to catch her mistakes and rank her opinions. I did wonder why a museum would allow a tour guide to disrupt the enjoyment of other visitors but she may have been one of their own. While some changes would improve the visitor experience this is a nice small museum for those who are reluctant to invest a long day looking at images until their eyes blur."

Monet's large water lilies can only be found in two museums, Musee de l'Orangerie and MOMA in NYC (I assume they are still there as it has been quite a few years since we were last there). The ground floor has a series of rooms showcasing contemporary artists to Monet, which is also well worth the visit."

The two rooms which each exhibit 4 very large curved paintings were designed/specified by him to maximize their impact. The rooms have skylights to maximize the quality of light, which of course is what the impressionists were all about. Also, there are other impressionist and post impressionist painters shown downstairs including Van Gogh. Only need an hour or two here to enjoy."

The rooms are perfectly designed to display these beautiful artworks and I encourage you to just sit and stare at each of them. As you do, and as the light changes with the moving sun overhead, each painting comes to life. They are truly astounding and well worth the visit.The lower floor also houses a collection of art that is worthy in it's own right but for me, the Monets are the draw-card. Just breathtaking!"

Coat check and ticket lines were short. The main attraction was straight ahead on the main floor, two oval shaped rooms housing the main events, Monet's Waterlilies. I bought the audio guide for that part and it was a waste of Euros. Not necessary as the two rooms house four large pieces each. The free hand out gives a good enough explanation.This exhibit comprises the entire main floor. From there walk downstairs for the rest of the exhibits. Lined up along the walls of a long hallway type room you work your way down and back, passing paintings from artists such as Renoir, Cezanne, Picasso, Matisse, Laurencin, Modigliani, Rousseau, Derain, Utrillo, Guillaume and Soutine. There's also a small exhibit of miniatures of Guillaume's apartment.Down and back and you're done. In retrospect, I wish I'd gotten the audio guide for the downstairs instead of upstairs as they don't all come together in one purchase. All in all, if you love Monet and have never seen his Waterlilies I'd say it's worth it.If you've seen them before, as I have at MOMA in NYC, and are short on time, you could take a pass. I've seen all these other artists in other museums before.Staff was friendly, building provided filtered natural light from the ceiling which was special. Other than that, nothing particularly exciting about the building's architecture."

It is either a haven of peace after all the traffic and people, or the culmination of a calm and contemplative stroll. It's not a large gallery, but it does have an impact. Downstairs at present is an exhibition of art once belonging to one of the great art dealers of the late 19th/early 20th century. You can get close to Picasso, Matisse, Renoir, Cezanne, Gaugin, Modigliani . . . and then upstairs there are the special rooms for Monet's last great Water Lily paintings. 8 curving murals, 22 panels stretching round 300 feet. you can stand or sit and contemplate from the centre of the room; and you can get up close to the mysterious splodges of paint and gouges in the thick surface. The dark colours and indistinct shapes tell you he was old and nearly blind when he made this, but it makes it all the more awe-inspiring. I love the Orangerie!"

I eventually got into the museum and the art wasn't that great, seemed a little repetitive. I only spent little over an hour here and had lunch here. I'm glad I didn't pay the \u20ac13 admission fee (you don't have to pay for museum entry if you're under 26 & an EU citizen in Paris, thankfully!) because it feels like it was too expensive for what it is worth.

We had to queue for about 10 minutes because they control the number of admissions. Once inside we began with the huge Monet panels in the curved rooms, amazing. In this gallery you have time and space to really look at the artwork without fighting through the crowds. After admiring the Monet pieces we went to the lower floor to view a lovely collection of Impressionist and more modern art. This is a small gallery but well worth the visit."

In 1921 the building became an annex of the Musee du Lumembourg.This is a beautiful museum in which to spend an hour or two and a mandatory prelude to a visit to Giverny to see the inspiration for much of Monet's work.The No. 1 metro - Concorde stop and the No 72 bus line will deliver you to the museum and the surrounding Place de la Concorde, Jardins des Tuileries."

I was so excited to see Monet's Water Lilies and was then treated to fabulous exhibit of Renoir, Cezanne, Modigliani, Matisse, Picasso, and two I had never seen - Derain & Soutine. The Soutine paintings are captivating- I bought the small catalog in the museum store to take home. We had gone through the Louvre prior to l'Orangerie. It made me appreciate the impact of the Musee de 'lOrangerie that much more. Wonderful!!!! Do not miss it- or the beautiful walk along the Seine to get to it!"

It has a lot of art, but it doesn't overwhelm you like the Louvre or Musee d'Orsay or other large museums can. The Monet ellipse rooms are breathtaking and definitely the highlight of the museum. Their collection of art ranging from Renoir to Matisse to lesser known artists around the same time is great. It's a less visited museum, so crowds usually aren't as bad as the bigger places. I went during the off-season a couple of times and it was so peaceful. The museum is also in a great location, at the end of the Champs-Elysees, on the other side of the Jardin Tuileries from the Musee du Louvre, and across the river from Musee d'Orsay. If you don't have access to free entry or have the Paris Visite pass, then I would recommend getting the joint entry ticket that also allows you to visit the Musee d'Orsay, that you can easily walk to."

The rest of the collection downstairs had some very nice pieces as well. I would thoroughly recommend and would certainly prioritise this over the Mona Lisa if you are limited for time! We got there about half an hour after opening and there were very few people there. Tuileries nice for a stroll afterwards or walkable over the Seine to the Musee d'Orsay if you have the combined ticket."

Entrance into the museum is free for children and students and was \u20ac9 for adults making this a fairly inexpensive stop. Located in a great spot by the Jardin de Tuilieres my daughter and I first rose the Ferris wheel before going to see Monet and Picasso's works here. The two rooms, designed with help from Monet himself to ensure the best experience viewing the Water Lilies, can get crowded. But if you sit on the benches provided and just wait the two rooms do clear out. The only annoying thing were the people doing stupid things to get the best photo possible. It got irritating having people constantly sticking their phones on our faces to take pictures from our perspective. Otherwise. If you have no reason to go to this museum other than the Water Lilies this museum is a must go. There is also some amazing fresh squeezed orange juice for sale in the cafe that my daughter and I loved."

OMG, if you are in Paris for hours rather than days then grab a taxi to this museum and experience Monet; your life will be all the richer for this experience.His massive works are displayed in all their glory in this beautiful building that many would pass without a second thought. Because of this the museum isn't a crush of people and you can just sit an soak up the brilliance that is Monet.If there's an audio guide, I wasn't aware of it but then seen my review on du Louvre for my experience with them this trip.There's the obligatory gift/souvenir shop but I must say these are much better than the trashy tat you get some places, in fact the three museums, Louvre, Orsay & Orangerie all have a good selection of decent memorabilia. Sure you can get fridge magnets but also fashions, books, CD's/DVD's, mugs etc and some overlap but mostly specific to the venue.Again there's a cafe which is not a bad snack option, you won't nessecarily need a full day at this museum but the Louvre and d'Orsay do require a day each at least so combining this one might be tricky unless you're doing a night visit to one of the latter. I recommend you do this last of the three combined with a special lunch to contemplate all you've seen."

The downstairs collection of other paintings from the late 19th/early 20th century was an eclectic mix of good and bad work from various different painters. The Orangerie is easy to add to any Paris itinerary due to its central location and is worth a quick trip."

A bastion of calm, serenity and left me with that feeling you get after visiting a forest. A sense of connection and well being. The gallery is perfectly sized for a visit with kids. We visited in April and there was almost no wait to get in. That may be due to the reaction to the Bataclan attacks or a fluke because I get the feeling its usually incredibly busy. But either way it is worth the effort to go. I would make an attempt to get in very early and spend time in Monet's Lilies before it gets crowded."

These are really impressive, and the museum staff do a really good job of keeping the space they are in quiet enough and free of people taking too many photos to really appreciate the works.The basement/lower floor of the museum also houses some amazing pieces of art, but for us it would be worth a trip back just to see the Waterlilies again."

It wasn't crowded when we went and that was a good thing. This is going to sound bad but it is the god awful truth.. Chinese and some of the other Asian tourists are the bane of your existence while you are in Paris. I kid you not.. It only takes one or two, they will stand inches from painting and point to every detail for what seems like an eternity, then, on to the next painting to do the same annoying thing. Imagine a tour bus full of them.. That is hell on earth and it ruins any experience you will have. No other tourists I have seen do it. You can have 10+ people look at a painting if you stand back like normal. Nope, you get these Asian idiots who block an entire piece because they hover over it. This is why going early is important. Go late? Good luck seeing and experiencing this gallery. Another thing.. The galleries and museums in Paris are interesting about bringing bags in. A back pack will need to be checked in. A purse or shoulder bag doesn't. I have my travel man purse/shoulder bag and I never had to check it. When I wore my slightly bigger backpack I had to bag check that thing all day long."

The Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie is near the northwest end of the Tuileries Garden, just before the Place de la Concorde. \u201cThe Water Lilies (Nymph\u00e9as),\u201d by Claude Monet is a compilation of eight gigantic paintings displayed in the two consecutive oval rooms. The four paintings known as \u201cThe Water Lilies: Green Reflections,\u201d \u201cThe Water Lilies: Morning,\u201d \u201cThe Water Lilies: Clouds,\u201d and \u201cThe Water Lilies: Sunset\u201d are in one room, and those known as \u201cThe Water Lilies: The Two Willows,\u201d \u201cThe Water Lilies: Clear Morning with Willows,\u201d \u201cThe Water Lilies: Morning with Weeping Willows,\u201d and \u201cThe Water Lilies: Reflections of Trees\u201d are in the second room.Upstairs were works from the personal collection of Paul Guillaume, who was a trend-spotting art dealer in Paris in the 1920s. In that collection, we saw paintings by Pablo Picasso, Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Amedo Modigliani, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Henri Matisse, Cha\u00efm Soutine, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin, Henri \u201cLe Douanier (the customs officer)\u201d Rousseau, Marie Laurencin, Kees Van Dongen, and Maurice Utrillo. There was also a temporary exhibition (ending on July 18) entitled \u201cApollinaire, the Eyes of the Poet\u201d that displayed art created during the period between 1902 and 1918 when Guillaume Apollinaire was active as an art critic. The next temporary exhibition is supposed to be \u201cAmerican Painting in the 1930\u2019s\u201d and is scheduled to run from October 12, 2016, to January 30, 2017.As stated by Andr\u00e9 Masson in 1952, the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie is \u201cthe Sistine Chapel of Impressionism.\u201d That\u2019s a perfect description; if you enjoy modern art, go to Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie; you\u2019ll be glad you did."

Because of the flooding the Louvre and Orsay were both closed to safeguard their collections. I mention that to explain that the line to get in was extremely long. We waited patiently and finally made it in. Security is tight and was a major reason for part of the wait. The museum is basically in 2 sections. One highlights Monet's huge murals painted at Giverny and gifted to the museum. They are worth the visit if you are a Monet fan. The museum is located on the Seine and was an easy walk from our hotel on the Champs Elysees. Several nice local places to eat are within easy walking distance. As with most of the museums in Paris, we highly recommend getting tickets in advance of your visit."

You actually feel like you are in the impressionist paintings. Downstairs are select works by Utrillo, Cezanne, Renoir, Matisse and Picasso. There were many beautiful paintings but they were displayed in a way that one did not feel overwhelmed. There were walls with paintings but in front of them were blank walls with benches. It all seemed very manageable and we came away feeling like we really knew something about each painter. Incredible place. The staff were very helpful when we needed elevators rather than stairs and were especially helpful at the main entrance where bright sun and our age did not permit us to stand for the time it took for security and to purchase a ticket. There is much respect for the elderly. Don't miss this museum! It's peaceful and beautiful."

When I walked into the first oval room with the water lilies, I was not prepared for the breathtaking beauty of those paintings. It's good that there was a bench where I could sit and catch my breath, because when you walk into the room it's surreal, like you've opened the gateway to another dimension. Both the oval rooms are fantastic, no description can prepare you for the paintings. I doubt I will experience this feeling ever again. The icing on the cake are the paintings in the lower level, fabulous collection and very well organised. Fascinating, breathtaking, inspiring, humbling. I had not expected the Orangarie to be such a beautiful experience. We visited the Orangerie with our two young children, who were also spellbound by the paintings. A must visit museum - and I would chose it over the Louvre."

I had the combination ticket from the Musee D\u2019Orsay the day before, so we did not have to wait to get in. The top floor has nothing but two rooms in an elliptical shape with 360 degree paintings in each of the water lily gardens. We had just seen another such display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in March, so were not as wowed as we might have been.From 1914 until his death in 1934, Monet's art dealer amassed an extraordinary collection of several hundred paintings, from Impressionism to Modern Art, along with pieces of African art. When he died, at the height of his career, rich and famous throughout Europe and in America, he was planning to found a museum. His widow Domenica, remarried to the architect Jean Walter, transformed and reduced the collection while also making new acquisitions. She wanted to name the collection after both her husbands when the French State acquired it in the late 1950s. From then on, the collection was destined for display at the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie. Currently, it comprises 25 works by Renoir, 15 by C\u00e9zanne, 1 each by Gauguin, Monet and Sisley, all from the Impressionist period. From the 20th century, the museum boasts 12 works by Picasso, 10 by Matisse, 5 by Modigliani, 5 by Marie Laurencin, 9 by Douanier Rousseau, 29 by Derain, 10 by Utrillo, 22 by Soutine and 1 by Van Dongen. This was the entire bottom floor and the audioguide was so good that we ended up there for 5 hours.The audio was the best we have ever heard in an art museum anywhere in the world and the museum should not be missed along with the Musee D'Orsay if you have ANY interest in Impresssionism"

Couple this visit either before or after visiting his home and water lily garden in Giverny and you will truly bask in the glory of his inspiration!Monet painted those canvases in Giverny but it was only 20 years after his death that the government of France turned his vision to reality and created this museum in his honour. The rooms containing these precious paintings are curved, as Monet had envisioned it, and perfectly display his canvases. There are comfortable seats located in the center of each room so that admirers may sit and contemplate ... losing themselves in the beauty of representation. Monet captures light, movement, and the pure wonder and love he felt for his peaceful haven. It is truly not to be missed!!"

It was the lease crowded, and the rooms were designed by Monet himself in order to display his lilies the way he thought they should be shown. Exquisite. We also did a guided tour in English for an extra 6 Euros, which I would highly recommend. They don't allow large backpacks into the museum, and instead check them at the front- so try to pack light when you go."

There other works on famous artists also displayed that made the museum a joy. Great impressionists works were there for you to see and enjoy. I sure did. I am also glad that I did this museum first before we traveled to le Giverny to visit Monet's House and Gardens. The Water Lily Garden across the street by going under a tunnel is like heaven would be like. The ponds with the lilies, the wooden boats, the weeping willows, the bridges. One sees first hand the inspiration for Monet's famous paintings. He taught other artists here too. LE Giverny is a delightful little town where you will meet today's impressionists."

The new structure was built on the garden terrace along the SeineBefore this, the orange trees were housed in the Grande Galerie of the Louvre. The exposition of the Nympheas or Water Lilies, according to Claude Monet\u2019s own suggestion, were set out in the two consecutive oval rooms. These rooms have the advantage of natural light from the roof, and are oriented from west to east, following the course of the sun and one of the main routes through Paris along the SeineMonet greatly increased the dimensions of his initial project of eight compositions, started before 1914. He wanted visitors to be able to immerse themselves completely in the painting and to forget about the outside world The first room brings together four compositions showing the reflections of the sky and the vegetation in the water, from morning to evening The second room contains a group of paintings with contrasts created by the branches of weeping willow around the water\u2019s edge. In addition there are other exhibitionsWe saw APOLLINAIRE , LE REGARD DU POETE which looks at the period between 1902 and 1918 when Guillaume Apollinaire was active as an art critic in the turbulent times of the early 20th century.Poet, critic, friend of artists and one of the first to discover African arts, Apollinaire proved to be a key player in the aesthetic revolution that led to the birth of modern art.The exhibition explores Apollinaire\u2019s universe from Douanie, Rousseau to Matisse, Picasso, Braque and Delaunay, from Cubism to Orphism and Surrealism, from academic sources to modernity, from tribal arts to popular arts.JEAN WALTER - PAUL GUILLAUME COLLECTIONPaul Guillaume's collection sits naturally alongside Apollinaire's exhibition. He was introduced into the avant-garde circles by Apollinaire, who became his adviserThe museum\u2019s garden presents sculptures by Rodin, Claudell and Moore among others..Buy tickets ahead of time online.

To be able to stand or sit and reflect on Monet's Water Lily murals is to be held in thrall of this great art. I went twice so that I could more fully enjoy the experience in the early morning with fewer visitors and more quiet in which to meditate on the art.Don't miss the excellent exhibit in the lower level which comprises art from the collection of the great early 20th century dealer Paul Guillaume and Jean Walter: works of Cetane, Matisse, Picasso, Modigliani, Derain, Laurencin, Renoir, Cezanne, Utrillo and Soutine. I especially enjoyed the tiny replica of Paul Guillaume's study."

The Paris Access Pass that worked so well at other venues did little here. The lines just sat still outside (thank god it was a nice day) and I guess the Pass did give us a little help as our line move a slight bit faster. Once you get in the door they are very strict about the no bags thing. A parent freaked out when he could not bring his baby bag inside! Like they should have told him before he got in line that this was the case or maybe he could read the \"no bags\" sign. Oh well, all types come here.The building is a great location and has swell lighting to show off the works. It is so funny once you get past the big lines and are inside, it is not crowded at all. Nice seating and you can relax to view the works and move on the see another portion of the painting...don't think I've been in another museum where you look at one part of the work and move on the see another part of the same painting!"

And this one sucks. Price wise and time wise it just few things to see. Worth visiting if you are into cubism or into monet and no cues can stop you."

I didn't realize how small the museum was (not a bad thing) or know that it wouldn't be crowded like the other museums. So I was very pleased that the museum was pretty empty while I was there so I could sit and take in all of the Monet panels. Then I was able to explore the lower level at my own pace. After being at the very crowded D'Orsay, this was a nice treat. The atmosphere at this museum was very serene and peaceful just to take in all the artwork. It was a lovely visit and I highly recommend it. Also you can buy a combined ticket with D\"Orsay and skip the line."

There are banquettes in the middle of the rooms to allow viewers to sit and take in the masterpieces. Of course one should also see the Musee Marmorean, the main Monet museum in Paris, but the Water Lilies is a fabulous entree into Monet's gardens in the village of Giverny.One of the best aspects of the Orangerie from a tourist's viewpoint is that it is small. It doesn't require a whole day (or several) the way the Louvre or the Musee d'Orsay do. One caveat is that it is not included in some of the museum passes, but the entry fee is a small price to pay to maintain these artistic masterpieces. The museum's location at the end of the Tuilerie Gardens near so many landmarks makes it a must-see for that reason too."

In other words, a perfect day for visiting one of Paris' great art museums, but it won't be the Louvre or the Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay. Even at this time of year they will be thronged and the experience would not be a pleasant one. Yes the art will knock your socks off, but the crowds just make it impossible to just stand, stare and appreciate. Instead I want a place where I can contemplate the art at leisure and not try to cram in hundreds of works of art in one sitting, or more accurately, standing. Fortunately, there is just such a place - the Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie or Orangerie as most people just call it, has a small, but great collection of impressionist art, highlighted by Monet's huge water lilies canvases. Although the collection is nowhere near as vast as Musee D'Orsay it's good enough that if it were in any city other than Paris it would be considered a must visit gallery.The Orangerie is located at the south-west corner of the Tuileries gardens and even with the mildly inclement weather it's a pleasure walking along the Seine side of the gardens to get there. The building itself was erected to house the orange trees that lined the gardens in summer, but had to be relocated in winter. From the outside it looks nothing like a de facto greenhouse, but inside it is surprisingly naturally bright.In 1922 the great French impressionist Claude Monet donated eight massive waterlily canvasses to the nation and it was determined that they would be housed in the Orangerie. Unlike Van Gogh and many others, Monet was extremely famous during his long life time and the gift became an immediate national treasure. Then in 1959 and 1963 the Orangerie received the collections of the late art dealer Paul Guillaume and industrialist Jean Walter. Both had amassed among the world's best private collections of impressionist and early 20th century artists. There are 146 paintings in those collections and with the Monet's, makes for a very manageable number to digest in one viewing.Just across from the entrance to the Orangerie is a copy of one of Rodin's most famous works, The Kiss.The admission fee is nine euros and another four for the audioguide. The latter is well worth it because almost every painting has an audioguide number on it and each contains a detailed description of what the painting is meant to represent and what was going on in the artist's life at the time. I suspect this will be very useful when we get to the Cubists. The first thing I notice is something that's not here - hordes of tourists. In this place you can actually enjoy the art in relative peace You can also take non-flash photography.There is a wonderful collection of Renoirs, Cezannes, Picassos, Matisses and others as well as the eight huge Monet waterlilies that takes about two hours to see - enough to satisfy, but not enough to cause the eyes to glaze over.Enjoy the pictures!"

If you make a casual visit to the Louvre and have an hour to spare after seeing the highlights, situated in its Tuilleries Gardens outside is the charming Orangerie gallery. It's not going to take all day, and their small collection is era and genre specific (post-impressionism), but there are some big names here: Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso, Renoir et al. They just mightn't be the masterpieces that are imprinted in your memory. The museum's crowning glory, however, are the oval halls adorned with eight Monet Waterlilies murals. These aren't loans or acquisitions, but constitute the rooms themselves. For a Monet fanatic, this could be the Sistine Chapel of post-impressionism. There's a very pleasant cafe and bookshop, and admission was cheap. A lovely stop between the Louvre and the monumental Place de la Concorde, which is just over the wall."

L'orangerie was the perfect fit. The water lilies were phenomenal - 2 rooms with 8 full wall panels - worth the visit just to see that, but there were 3-4 other rooms with a smattering of other French artists which gave a nice overview without being too overwhelming.The building is interesting - used to be the shelter for the orange trees of the Tuilleries"

If you don't have the time to take a day-trip to the home and gardens of Giverny, where Monet painted many of his masterpieces, then you must come see the works displayed in the Orangerie. Monet himself played a part in the creation of this facility and how his work would be displayed (with natural light coming in from above and his eight canvases hung in two rooms). It's peaceful (despite tourists) and a magical experience. I would also recommend taking a turn downstairs where even more impressionist painters are displayed (including a large collection of Renoir). The cafe downstairs is not a bad stop if you're looking for a croissant and a coffee. Shouldn't need more than an hour or so for this museum, but it's worth it."

This venue is smaller than the much larger museums around it yet has a breathtaking collection on display. The crowds were far less than the Louvre and there was far more space to stand back and view the works. Entry is \u20ac9 per adult. We asked about concessions for disabled - it's free for the disabled person and their carer with proof of disability ( a photocopied disabled badge) which we had. There are lifts for wheelchair access to each floor too. The pieces in the lower floor vary depending upon the exhibitions - we saw impressionist, cubism (Matisse, Monet, Renoir, Picasso, plus many others ). Fantastic. We stopped for a cup of tea before moving onto the next floor which I would recommend in order to collect your thoughts and refocus. The upper floor displays the larger Monet canvasses within the two oval rooms. The whole venue is amazing. It's placed next to Place de La Concorde and not too far from the Louvre. Would definitely recommend. I will be back when I'm next in Paris."

The were tour guides talking in several languages and young people more interested in taking and sharing their \"selfies\" with their friends than sitting quietly and enjoying the panels. I went off to enjoy the other works, the museum has a wonderful collection of impressionist works. Later, I returned to enjoy the water lollies in relative silence.

But that makes this the more exciting. Here is an artist rethinking what makes a \"visual experience\" just using nineteenth century paint and canvas -- and the way you are obliged to think about perspective is as exciting as looking at Picasso."

The Orangerie is a small art museum that will only take about an hour to view, but the LIGHT is amazing and that plus the shape of the room allow you to fully appreciate Monet's lilies. A friend traveled with me the last time I visited Paris (Nov 2014) and L'Orangerie was her favorite of everything we saw. Obviously the art is the draw, but there's a feeling of restful calm to the place that I've not experienced at any other museum. The lines can be long, but if you have the Paris Museum Pass (which I highly recommend, just schedule all of your museum visits in those day and you save not only a significant amount of money but ~time~) you can go to the door on the right that's specifically for pass holders and breeze in. The Louvre, D'Orsay, and L'Orangerie are the art museum trifecta (with honourable mention to the Rodin). Don't pass up the Musee de l'Orangerie just because it isn't as famous as the others."

His wife, Domenica, broadened the collection to include her favourite artists, including Cezanne, Gaughin and Renoir and all of these great artists are on display in abundance. If you have even a passing interest in French art of this period, this museum is a must and the queues are significantly shorter than at either the Louvre or the Musee d'Orsay."

For the first few minutes I almost felt disappointed - so many people blocking the view and taking selfies and, treacherous thought, the paintings almost seemed a clich\u00e9 of themselves initially - but just pick a good spot on one of the benches and be prepared to sit it out as the crowds mill around you, allowing yourself to sink into the pools. Gradually, you become immersed in the picture, as though you are part of the shimmering water and blooms. More and more of the light and shade takes form, you sort out the reflections from their originators. A heady experience. Then go and marvel at the amazing brush work close to. and wonder how those vivid, random looking splodges of colour created such a sublime experience. Then, when you can drag yourself away, go downstairs and be dazzled by a tightly packed collection of paintings by many other artists of the same period. Excellent value at around 9Euros and well worth seeing. We queued for about 20 minutes to get in which is not bad for Paris in these security conscious days."

The top floor is what most people come for, which is to view the enormous waterlily paintings of Claude Monet. They are in 2 rooms and they are absolutely fabulous. It is fascinating to view these works from afar to have them make sense but it's equally interesting to view them at arm's length (with a brush in hand) to try to imagine how he could have made shapes and colors that made no sense at that depth and yet perfect sense at 20 ft away. They say it was his failing eye sight that allowed for it. Downstairs is a very worthwhile eclectic collection of painting from the 19 and early 20th century that is also very compelling. If you loved the Monets here, make it a point to see the other great collection of Monet's works at the Musee Marmottan in the 16th. It's also quite extraordinary."

If one has been to the Barnes Museum in Philadelphia with over 150 Monets I would definitely give this a pass. There are far better museum options in Paris. The collection is really one floor that is like the wing of larger museums. It may be a place to go if there was a special exhibit."

He really liked this gallery.We had been to Giverny to Monets house the day before and seen the real lilies. so it was a nice way to round out the experience.There are some other beautiful pieces in the gallery. And some not so nice ones. But as with all art. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, *Dont take big backpacks as they have to be left at the entrance. But if you do make sure it is locked up.*As with all major Paris attractions watch out for the pick pockets and con artists. We actually saw a group running a scam on a guy while we where outside taking photo. *The Musee de l'Orangerie is in the Paris Museum Pass which I highly recommend for anyone going to 2 or more of any of the museums, attractions and city highlights.*Nice clean toilets here too. So if you have the pass and are walking by you can just use the bathrooms if you want. *recommend grabbing lunch in one of the close by gardens little bistros before or after visiting. its a great way to people watch. While it is a bit touristy the prices are not to bad."

They were showing two different prices on the wall, and I was asking if the reduced price was for under 26 EEA citizens (as there often is such a reduced price offerred at museums and sights). The woman at the counter didn't speak much English, so she just asked for my passport and after a quick chat with her collagues she told the museum is free for me. And for the museum: I went at a bad date, as I visited in between two different temporary exhibitions, so there wasn't one. Monet's huge water lily paintings are shown in a circular rooms, and while sitting down you are just surrounded by them. Cool. Downstairs was more diverse: loads of impressionist masters from Cezanne to Matisse and to earlier Picasso, and my forever favourite, Renoir. Included also many painters that I wasn't familiar with, but liked very much. The most interesting painter must have meen Andr\u00e9 Derain, whose technique is brilliant and his style(s) comes from a large scale. They even showcased next to each other two paintings with one subject that was painted in one in more classical way and second time in purely impressionist style. Information of the painters was provided in English and Spanish too, and different audio guides could be rented for 5e. I wished for more information of the museums history, as Paul Guillaume himself is just as interesting as the artists he was exhibitioning."

Although smaller in size and exhibits, there is plenty to feast your eyes on, especially is you are an Impressionist lover or lover of the late 19th century works of art. Monet's Nymphanies (Water Lilies) was every bit of pleasure that was advertised. I was there in a brilliant day in January, and the diffused light in the two oval rooms was perfect to sit and reflect on Monet's beautiful works of art. I spent 3 hours at the museum and could have spent more!"

Since the two galleries are oval-shaped, you sit in the center as if you were in the middle of the pond of water lillies.

Monet's Water Lilies are indescribably beautiful and calming - I could look at them for hours. It is entirely wheelchair accessible.One of the guards said that the museum only started allowing photography in the last year. Museum, I beg you to change this policy - do not allow disruptive photographers. Visitors, please actually look at these paintings for more than two minutes. If you want a picture, get a postcard. Don't go just to say you did - go and let your soul be absorbed into eternity."

I must say it is definitely unusual but the scale of the art for me left a lot to be desired. I was expecting spectacular and was disappointed. I honestly think the art collection in the basement which was donated to the museum was wonderful and included a lot of the famous impressionists. I would certainly recommend it to others. I guess I was just expecting too much."

They are huge and take my breath away. When I finally pull myself away, there are some wonderful works of art to see downstairs as well.

The Monet paintings are really beautiful and worth to look but (at the time of my visit) there were many paintings from other artists missing from the walls and some other details that gave me the impression that the museum is a bit \"abandoned\". I have to say that I liked the exhibition, because it allows you to know a bit of each artist, their style and their history and I did learn a lot, but it is a very small museum for a 7-euro entrance, so I strongly recommend to buy the paired ticket Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay + l'Orangerie (which is 14 euros) and you will save some money (Orsay Museum costs 12 euros). If you want to visit the museums in 2 different days (like I did), you can! Be sure to keep your ticket, because is one ticket for both museums AND you have up to 3 months to use it!! After my visit, I would recommend you that you go to this museum first (remember to ask for the ORSAY+L'Orangerie), since it opens at 9am and 2 hours are more than enough for this, and then spend the rest of the day in the Orsay Museum! I visited in winter, but if you visit in summer you could make a pause in the beautiful gardens that surround the museum (Jardin des Tuileries) before walking to the Orsay Museum (just across de river)"

Once we got in the entrance we saw only one security check window and one staff at there checking people's bag and asking them to show cell phones. There were about 5 or 6 securities or staff there but non were doing their job (i.e. Helping people to get in ). When I went through the security check the staff let me in but one female security suddenly approached and said my backpack was too large and wouldn't let me in. I was very surprised as I carried the same backpack to other museum such as the Musee D'Orsay, Louvre, Picasso, etc. By all means I believe my backpack was not a super size, it was merely a 30L backpack which I carried everyday to everywhere during my week-long stay at Paris. I asked the security if there was another way such as storing my backpack. To my surprise they said no and they said I must leave as my backpack was too large. I had a confused look at that time as I hope there's another way as I waited in the rain for 1 hour in order to get in and I did not want to leave just because of such subjective look at my backpack and simply claimed it was too large. But in 2 seconds there were 3 securities forcing me out of the museum.This was outrageous. I saw that right opposite to the security check there was a cloak room for storage. Even if you really couldn't store my backpack, I believed the staff there should at least explain clearly their policy of hand carry ( such as size of backpack) before taking any action. I was totally disguised by what they did and their way of crowd control. I completely lost my faith and good image of the Paris tourism due to this event.For all tourists who do not want to be treated secondarily, AVOID this museum."

Admission protocols are a bit problematic; approach to museum passes seems erratic. Certainly expensive (a typical French issue ...). One thing I find particularly irritating ... as I recall, non-flash photography is permitted. However, the amount of \"selfie/famous art work\" stuff going on was a pain. One clown asked (demanded) that my wife move aside so he could be photographed with the \"famous\" artwork as a background. He was most insistent. Probably, when he gets back home, he will never look at the image again. Cameraphones seem like a very good idea for banning photography in museums - flash or not. BTW - staff were a bit unfriendly as well. Wouldn't say you shouldn't visit but, if it is a choice between this and the Muse\u00e9 d'Orsay, head for the latter. Best regards, OMB (JR)"

They do provide a haven of peace, contemplation, and tranquility that Monet must have experienced at Giverny. They are worth the visit by themselves, but when you add the Paul Guillaume collection of impressionists on the lower level - well now you have something beyond extraordinary. Art dealer, collector and gallery owner, Guillaume encouraged and supported artists whose fame was due in part to his assistance. Cezanne, Modigliani, Matisse, Picasso, Utrillo and others are shown here with excellent interpretive signage in English and French. Spending time studying all that is offered here should earn you a degree in Art History. Intelligently and beautifully displayed art in a comfortable, welcoming setting. It is a must see."

Monet Nympheas are the reason I went there, and they are an exceptional work of art, something that really blowed me away, like nothing I've seen in museums ever. Since there was no people yet we got the chance to enjoy the rooms and art all by ourselves and the feeling of peace there is indescribable. Other works are also very nice. Definitely the best museum in Paris."

We had our museum pass, so after we went through security, we walked right in. My breath was immediately taken away. Seeing the waterlilies was incredibly moving, but it was also a respite from the large crowds of Paris. We were there at the beginning of March and when the sun came out, so did all of Paris! It was overwhelming, but the museum was a nice place to regroup. I can't wait to go back someday."

I hope many Parisiens have been visiting the haven of peace to be found in this unique museum, especially after the horrific violation of Parisien life which occurred last Friday, 11-13-15. Monet's intention was to create this peaceful island of meditation for the people of France. Two oval rooms show scenes inspired by his water gardens at Giverny at different times of the year. As a lover of painting, I experienced intense pleasure examining his brush strokes and sense of color. If you look at it closely, you lose the image, but are aware of the strokes of his hand. If you stand or sit on the benches in the middle of the room, the image solidifies as the garden images he intended. Don't stop your exploration there. Make sure you visit the other galleries to see the works of Renoir, Cezanne, Rousseau, Modigliani, Laurencin, Matisse, Picasso, Derain, Utrillo and Soutine. There is more - visit the special exhibition. When I was there it was, Who's Afraid of Women Photographers? 1839 - 1919. If you get there soon, you can see the work of Julia Margaret Cameron, an American Photographer who was ahead of her time, fiercely independent. Located on the West Corner of the Tuileries Garden, the museum is easy to find near the middle of Paris."

We unfortunately lost one of our Paris Museum Passes on the day that we went there. We did not realize this until we were in line. Once we got to the ticket agent we asked her what we could do. She told us if we had the receipt to get it and when we brought it, she would allow us in. We had to go back to our apartment to get it, so it took us a half hour to do that and when we returned she was at lunch and we were told that was not the case and that we had to buy a ticket. We realize looking the museum pass was not anyones fault but our own, but why were we told otherwise? It wasted our time for absolutely no reason. We were quite upset to say the least. Needless to say, we accepted things as they were and paid for one ticket. Since it was lunch time, we visited the cafe which is downstairs and sort of mixed in with the gift shop. There is not a ton to choose from but enough to at least refuel for the afternoon. Once we were done, we walked around a bit. It is not a huge museum and really the only thing we enjoyed was the Monet Water Lillies room which has always been a favorite of mine. It is a stunning room and that alone is well worth the visit."

Our visit to the Musee de l\u2019Orange where the Water Lilies by Monet are on display was one of our more enjoyable museum visits on our last visit to Paris. This exhibit is housed in a very beautiful build at the west corner of the Tuileries Gardens next to the Place de la Concorde in Paris. The building has been renovated several times over the years. During the last renovation the skylight was completed to cover the complete top of the building giving great lighting to this wonderful exhibit hall and Monet\u2019s water lilies. It is hard to describe how beautiful these paintings are by Monet. The beautiful colors and how he blended the blues and greens of the water with the vivid colors of the water lilies themselves. I commend the creators of the galleries and how they designed the exhibit halls themselves to present these beautiful pieces of art. The viewing halls are very quiet and peaceful almost like you at Giverny sitting on the bank of Monet\u2019s water garden, enjoying the water lilies. In each of the large exhibit rooms there are several benches for you to sit on, so you can relax and take your time to enjoy this beautiful art.I do have a couple of suggestions for your visit to Musee de l\u2019Orange. There are other works of art displayed in this museum also, so plan to spend some time to visit the entire art museum. If by chance you are visiting Paris the first Sunday of the month this exhibit is free. The regular hours are 9 to 6 daily, I would suggest to visit early in the morning, it will be quieter, shorter wait lines and more time for you to enjoy the gallery. When you enter the museum you will come up to an area where you will pay to enter the exhibit halls. There are ticket options that are available to you to purchase that you would not be aware of if you had not been there prior. There are 2 options that you might find interesting that will save you some money. One option is a joint ticket that includes this museum and the Musee d\u2019 Orsay wich is located a very short walk from here and should be on your list to visit also while in Paris. The other option includes this museum and the entrance to the Monet gardens in Giverny, this might be of interest to you if you are planning a trip there during your stay in Paris.Hope this has helped your visit to the Musee de l\u2019Orange.Have fun and enjoy the \u201cCity Of Lights\u201dLary1047"

At the time of our visit, there was only a fantastic exhibition on Women and Photography.

Enjoy an early morning stroll through the Tuileries to reach the museum and arrive as early as possible to avoid the crowds.When we visited, there was also a fascinating exhibition of many works by other artists of Monet's era displayed on the lower level."

Get a Museum Pass so you can breeze right in \u2014 the entire collection is top-notch, and small enough so that you can see it all without museum fatigue setting in. Downstairs, the Paul Guillaume collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings is delightful, especially when you realize that they were assembled by one man for his own enjoyment. I'd never much liked Chaim Soutine until I saw his paintings here, and now I've completely changed my mind! But the true glory of the museum is upstairs: the Monet Waterlily paintings. They are like nothing else, and reward both a long view and repeated viewings. I've seen them 4 times, and always come away with a new appreciation of what he accomplished. I'm a painter so maybe I'm biased, but my partner \u2014 who is NOT a painter and has a preference for fairly realistic art \u2014 was moved to tears by this work. We saw them twice, and he's looking forward to seeing them on our next Paris junket."

But the setting/ rooms in which they are displayed add to the enjoyment of these masterpieces- no surprise that Monet himself helped design these galleries. However, the rest of the museum is quite wonderful with works by Picasso, C\u00e9zanne, Modigliani, Matisse and Renoir to name a few. The museum is well planned and not overwhelmingly large - it is not to be missed."

            "review": "This is not the best Monet Museum, though it houses some good impressionist paintings downstairs. Musee de l'Orangerie is best known for the enormous water lilies that Monet painted toward the end of his life (1919-1926) that line two gigantic rooms on the first floor. They are of impressive scale, and if one is a student of Monet, one should definitely go. For the rest of us Monet lovers, the Musee D'Orsay and Musee Marmottan are far better choices. There are three water lilies in each room (or maybe it's just five in total) -- huge and impressive -- but I found Monet's other work more intriguing for me. I may very well be revealing my ignorance - and that's okay -- because most of the people there were shooting multiple photos trying to capture something they likely couldn't appreciate from an art historian's perspective. It's true that photographs ARE permitted at L'Orangerie (they are not at Musee Marmottan). Other than the five or six water lilies, I don't think there are any more Monet's on display (there may be one or two downstairs). The downstairs galleries house a quite nice collection of impressionist artists. Between this and Musee D'Orsay, go to D'Orsay hands down. There is a combination ticket between the two that if purchased upfront will save the patron 4 Euros. I'd recommend that.The nice thing about the Musee L'Orangerie is that I didn't feel compelled to spend so many hours there. Whereas I was at the D'Orsay for over eight hours, I spent maybe two or three here -- and that was unnecessary. The D'Orsay is huge with Monets in multiple sections, so I jaunted among the locations to see how the artist's form had changed and evolved. Not that L'Orangerie isn't big -- it is -- but the galleries are smaller and with the enormous water lilies taking up so much space, the first floor is only that.In my opinion, unless one has the time, the inclination, some specific reason, or is a student of art history, this is one museum that is passable. I'm glad I went, but when I return to Paris, I won't feel the compulsion to necessarily return."

I was blown away, plus there was a Photography exhibit that had just opened in another gallery, focusing on women photographers in history. This was an amazing assortment for a (relatively) smaller museum. I could not leave -- so much to see. We ended up staying about 2 hours longer than anticipated! Yes, it is not the size of the Louvre or Musee du Orsay....definitely not as glamorous.

No long waiting like as with the other (more famous) Musea so that was already a good start. First visit were the two rooms that have wall-to-wall paintings from Claude Monet, famous for his impressions of his flowery garden and ponds. At the end of our visit I have to conclude this was actually the best part of the tour.The main exhibition has paintings from Renoir, Cezanne, Picasso, Sisley, so pretty great names. But the works that were on display were not as good as I would have expected. Crude even, with sometimes totally wrong dimensions. Like they were made in the time the artists were still educating/training themselves in the fine art of painting.Next time we\u2019ll go to D\u2019Orsay again."

The museum limits the size of baggage you can leave in the cloakroom and we saw a few people being turned away as they arrived with small wheeled suitcases.

This museum is an art lover's paradise."

You can admire Monet's 'Les Nypmhes' and loads of other paintings from various other painters like Picasso, Roussault, Matisse, Derain, Cezanne.

My husband and I have been to Paris too many times to count over a 35 year period, but until this last visit in August, 2015, were unsuccessful in getting into the Musee de l'Orangerie. It had been closed for renovation for too many years to count (and I really hadn't heard of it during the first 20 years that we visited Paris). I finally saw the Monet rooms in a recent Woody Allen film and realized that it must have finally reopened. The two Monet lilly pond rooms, each with four curved walls, covered in varying lilly pond landscapes, are breathtaking. The other impressionist paintings throughout this rather small museum are also magnificent (and some may have been moved to the Orangeries from the Musee d'Orsay since I know that I have seen some of them before)."

The lower level features a benefactor's extensive private collection but go for the Monet's on the main floor. As we were entering the building, we made the mistake of saying we were part of a group when security only let part of our party of 8 into the museum. This started a 30 minute confusion with numerous staff asking us to fill out special paperwork, etc. We finally realized there was a misunderstanding...we were not a \"registered\" group, but just a group of friends visiting the museum together. So, if you go with a group of friends and part of you are let inside and the others are left in the rain, DO NOT tell the security guard you are part of a group! Instead just let them know you are visiting the museum together and wait for your friends inside!"

It centers on two huge oval rooms where Monet's great waterlilies sequences are exhibited. They are, of course, breathtaking, and even the inevitable crush of visitors doesn't dull the experience. You can study them close-up, but also pull back to see the sweep. What is important about them, from an aesthetic perspective, is the absence of clear perspective; you are literally immersed in the world of these ponds with their various forms of plants. The remainder of the Orangerie, on the lower floor, is also filled with some fine paintings that are worth spending some time. But the Monet waterlilies are what people come for, and justifiably so."

The Waterlily rooms are located right after the ticket office, on the main floor, so single-minded people tend to head right there and then out again, leaving the rest of the galleries for more thorough art buffs.Painted in sections and then blended together in 8 large canvases, the Waterlilies are mounted in 2 oval rooms, specially designed by Monet himself to heighten the viewing experience. In one room, the scenes flow from early morning to late evening, the light reflecting off the water changing as the sky changes color. In the second room, the seasons change, so the vegetation is seen in different stated of growth and blossom. The only thing that would have made the whole experience more immersing would have been a quiet flowing water soundtrack, to dull the hum of people whispering, coughing and moving through the rooms, boots scuffling along the floor, Otherwise, we really enjoyed wandering about, getting up close to the painting to examine the brush strokes, moving back to appreciate the piece as a whole. Impressive to have that much vision.The rest of the museum is nice, too - not too big to get tiresome quickly, and not so small as we feel we are overpaying for the visit. The rest of the museum spreads out downstairs. There, we find works by Renoir and C\u00e9zanne, Matisse and Picasso, and a full exhibit on french artiste \u00c9mile Bernard, which closed the same day. All in all, it's a wonderful museum.One thing to note: if you plan on visiting the Musee d'Orsay, get the combined ticket here. You'll save money on the price getting them together than if you were to buy the two tickets separately. Also, the museum is closed on Tuesdays."

Spend a while admiring the water lilies in their natural lighting from the comfortable couches at the center of the room, then head down to the next floor for a great collection of impressionism/cubism. There are big names (Renoir, Picasso, Cezanne) but also some delightful ones less likely to be seen in the states (Laurencin, Derain) - and unlike the Louvre, these exhibits are well marked and commented. You'll walk away from this bright space feeling refreshed."

Most people just stop there. But, if you love impressionism make sure that you go to part two. The Orangerie is an often overlooked museum that has additional works by such giants as Monet, Renoir and Gauguin. I went to 10 o'clock in the morning in late September and there was no line. Not only that, but without the crowds you could just stand there and appreciate the beauty of these paintings. You will see lots of familiar prices. If you have a museum pass, this museum is part of the group. If you want the audio guy and it will cost you five euro.

The two water lillies rooms are beautifully laid out and have benches to sit a while and enjoy them. Try to go on off hours so that you dont have hoards of tour bus crowds blocking the lillies. We hit it right on a Sunday morning at 10 am. As we left the relatively uncrowded venue at 11:30 the tour buses were just rolling up. Maybe we were just lucky. Late might work too. In any event- don't miss it. Its a great way to spend a charming hour or two with no museum fatigue at the end."

You will have more of a deeper appreciation of the water lily panels that Monet painted at Giverny once you have already seen the water lilies in the Water Garden at his house. Be wary of not having to bring large size backpacks at they are quite strict to enforce you to check in your oversized baggage. Not a problem but can be an inconvenience to some if you are bringing different camera lenses, etc. There are two rooms of Monet's Water Lilies separated by the time of the day that they were drawn. If you have the chance, one should sit quietly at the benches in each room to fully immerse and focus on the changing light effect of the water lilies as they are huge and extends pretty much from one end of the room to the other end. An enjoyable and relaxing place to visit after a Louvre visit in the afternoon"

Although that IS the reason to go to this museum. But don't miss the collection of modern art downstairs. It includes some very fine works from Renoir, Cezanne and Picasso that are well worth seeing. What I enjoyed most, though, was the large variety of painting by Andre Derain, which show how many different styles he tried. There's also an excellent collection of Chaim Soutine and five wonderful pieces from Marie Laurencin. I visited this museum twice in six days and loved every minute of it. Do not miss it. Try to go during the week so you are not crowded out of the Waterlilies. Take time to sit and meditate there. It's why Monet painted those painting after all. Very peaceful and well worth the time.If you're going to the Musee d'Orsay, too, (and you should), then buy the combo pass. It will save you a little money and let you go back to both museums more than once."

Having visited Monet's gardens and house in Giverny earlier in the week, we relished the opportunity to see Les Nympheas (Water Lilies) as displayed in two separate elliptical rooms in Musee de l\"Orangerie. What an amazing experience. There is a circular bench in the center of each room, where you are encouraged to sit and marvel at the magical presentation of light and color arrayed before you. Take your time, and move around to different sections of the bench to fully appreciate what Monet has done. When you look at the works up close, they appear to be globs of color, but step back, and be entranced by the transformation. This is one of those experiences where you have to be there to appreciate it. The art on the lower floor, the Walter-Guillaume collection, is also very much worth your time. There are works by Picasso, Derain, Renoir, and Cezanne. All are wonderful works. But the Water Lilies are why you are there. See them first. Then, see them again."

Perhaps they missed the lower level, which has about 250 additional paintings. The museum is located at the south-western end of the Jardin des Tuileries, not too far from the Louvre.The centerpieces for me were the two oval rooms on the first (ground) floor showcasing several of Monet's water lilies. I was surprised to see these so large, wall sized. The presentation in the oval rooms, with an oval sitting couch at the center, lets each painting stretch into your peripheral vision. Sitting quietly, especially if you come early morning before the crowds, you can imagine yourself sitting at a pond with his lilies. The Waterlily exhibits were designed specifically for and by Monet, to show his grandest works. This is how he wanted them seen.And while Impressionism is a highlight here, many other periods and styles are represented too -- from Picasso's cubist and earlier works, to Rembrandt, to lesser known international artists. I enjoyed this museum because of its scale -- not too large, not too small. Art aficionados can see it in about 2 hours, or only 30-minutes for someone wanting an Impressionism fix.Go for the beautiful expressive presentations of Monet's masterpieces. And if you're truly interested in Monet, his last house is in the village of Giverny (town of Vernon) an hour northwest of Paris. It's an easy escape into the countryside of France. The waterlilies pond on his property is absolutely superb -- it really looks like his paintings. Worth a visit if you have half a day (last admission at 5pm). If you plan to go to both, the l'Orangerie offers a discount off both tickets. While his house in Giverny doesn't accept the Paris Museum Pass, the Musee de l'Orangerie does and is definitely worth a stop.OPEN:9am - 5:45pm everyday except Tuesdays (closed 1st-May, 14-Jul, 25-Dec)FEES:Free if you bought the Paris Museum PassFree for children 18 or underFree to everyone the 1st Sunday of each month (but it's more crowded)\u20ac10 for adults (note: ages 18-26 can be free or at reduced rate of \u20ac6.50)WEBSITE: http://www.musee-orangerie.fr/ (click \"English\" on top-right)GUIDEBOOK: http://www.musee-orangerie.fr/documents/plan_guide_EN_%20juin14.pdf"

With only a few hours to spend on our last morning, we decided to visit this museum because they had Monet's Water Lilies. Well it turned out to be so much more than we expected. The museum has 2 galleries that were built specifically for these magnificent murals. The galleries are oval shaped with 4 large walls with each totally covered with a mural. Words and photos cannot describe the beauty. The rest of the museum is loaded with significant French Impressionist work by many artists that you will recognize (Renoir, Cezanne, etc.). Definitely worth a few hours and far less crowded than some of the better know museums that are just walking distance away."

While it does include art from other masters, the main attraction is the two large, circular rooms that display Monet's most famous paintings of his Water Lilies. To see these larger than life panels surrounding you is surreal. My only negative about the experience is that they seem rather strict about no photography while in the museum. I did not know this at first, and I had taken a picture of these gorgeous panels of the water lilies, when the sound of my camera's shutter had museum employees shouting at me.

Coupling this museum with the Musee D'Orsay across the Seine provides a cultural smorgasbord of impressionist art which needs at least 4 hours to assimilate. l'Orangerie is the Paul Guilliaume collection of impressionist art while the D'Orsay is a comprehensive collection of Impressionism art covering paintings, sculpture, furniture and murals. Well worth the time for a visit. The entry line can be long so it's worth paying a little extra to save having to stand in the sun."

My daughter couldn't get enough of this guide. Touring the museum is easy and everywhere you go you will be surprised and impressed. I say visit the Louvre just because it is only one of the most famous museums in the world but to truly appreciate art, you must visit the L'Orangerie. I aboslutely loved it.

Would recommend this museum for those who want a taste of art without the swarming crowds of the other museums.

Beautiful paintings by Monet in 2 giant oval rooms. It's a MUST for Monet waterlilies lovers. There are long benches so you can sit and admire the paintings. And the museum was designed to the specifications requested by Monet. Definitely utilize the panorama setting on the phones to take beautiful photos of it. On the bottom floor, they also had temporary exhibitions that was really excellent as well.

If you are a fan of Impressionist art, this should be one of your destinations. There are other artists' work in the museum as well, on other floors.

Also compliments for the Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie, their specific design with the oval galleries and soft lighting, really brought out the best in the paintings. Downstairs there was a gallery with temporary exhibitons and more modern art. Also very interesting, but because it was so completely different from what the \"purpose\" of this museum was (which are the Waterlillies), it kind of felt like the art displayed here did not fit into the original Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay anymore and just put here. And a tip: to avoid spending ages waiting in line in a burning sun, make sure you arrive here early. The museum doesn't take too long to view (about an hour), so it just doesn't add up to wait in line for 2 hours and then be outside again in an hour.

It is known for Claude Monet\u2019s \u201cLilies\u201d (Les Nymph\u00e9as), but the unquestionable highlight for me is the small permanent collection housed there since 1965 of garage owner Paul Guillaume and his wife Domenica who remarried after her husband\u2019s early death age 43 in 1934. Paul G began by collecting African sculptures which of course became a vital influence on the course of modern art. Through this he met the famous French poet G. Apollonaire who was was a lightning rod in Paris among a small group of now famous modern artists, Picasso et al. His collection, modified by his wife, brings some strong works by famous painters like Renoir, Cezanne and Matisse, also Picasso. But, more interesting perhaps, it brings a punch from the underrated chameleon Andre Derain, and important works by Modigliani (including a fine portrait of PG), the mercurial and inspirational Rousseau and the distinctive Russian expressionist Chaim Soutine. Plus a fine portrait of PG by Kees van Dongen. Throw in a tidy friendly caf\u00e9 and we have a top Paris art destination, and more manageable than say Musee d\u2019Orsay. "

We had seen beautiful Monet paintings in the Musee d'Orsay. This sort of prepared us for the \"Monet on steroids\" that we saw at Musee de l'Orangerie. Two rooms were filled with water lily landscapes, each painted in different lighting giving off a different mood. This was awe-inspiring and emotion-provoking These paintings, alone, were enough to make the museum visit worthwhile. However, there were other nice collections in the museum.Once again, I highly recommend the Paris Museum Pass. It not only saves money (if used regularly) but also saves time in the ticket queue."

There's also the private collection of Paul Guillaume in a significant new galley space beneath. He was an early collector, agent and friend to many impressionists; the works he purchased, and the time and place they capture are fascinating and fun. There's also a lovely gift shop and cafe. Go early or bring your museum pass (or both). This is a rewarding and doable museum; we had a teenager with us and it was just the right amount of art viewing and scope."

Eight of Monet's water lily paintings are displayed in two oval-shaped rooms. The murals are quite long, and the canvases were apparently glued to the walls during installation. The rooms are lit with skylights, and the natural light enhances the paintings beautifully. There are long benches in the center of the room, so you can sit and gaze at the paintings to your heart's content. The Collection of Jean Walter & Paul Guillaume is also housed in this museum, which features paintings by Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, Gaugin, Picasso, Derain, Modigliani, Rousseau, and Matisse, among others. The l'Orangerie also has a very nice gift shop! We visited the museum on an extremely hot day, and were pleasantly surprised to learn that it has excellent air conditioning. There were also fewer crowds at this museum, so we were able to take our time and really enjoy the paintings in peace. So, if you want to avoid large crowds and see some outstanding paintings, l'Orangerie is the place to go!"

Two peaceful ovoid rooms with diffused natural light take on the contemplative feel of the artist's effort to see the water and plants in different light at dawn and dusk.

Renoir, Rousseau, Modigliani, Matisse, Gauguin, Henry Moore, Picasso, and, of course, Monet. These pieces would be snapped up by any museum in the world that could. To give credit where credit is due, it is the very great gift of Paul Guillaume, an art collector who died in 1934, and his wife. Guillaume rubbed elbows with some of the very painters in the collection, which includes portraits of him. The generosity of donors like them allow all of us to enjoy these wonderful masterpieces.Although there are many paintings by iconic artists, here are the highlights:1. The stars of the show, so to speak, are the enormous Monet waterlily paintings in two large elliptical rooms. They are extremely well presented and you can see that many of the visitors are awed by them with good reason. A large number of the visitors come here primarily to see them. They have benches in the center of the room that invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy the vast murals.2. The Matisse paintings. Woman with Violin, Woman with Mandolin, the Boudoir, one of his Odalisque paintings. These are Matisse, in my very biased and humble opinion, at his peak.3. Modigliani. The Young Apprentice, plus one of the benefactor, Paul Guillaume himself.4. The Henry Moore sculptures outside. An art expert taught me to walk around Moore's sculptures - I highly recommend it.This museum is part of the Paris museum pass, which we highly recommend if you have several days in Paris and/or intend to visit more than a few arts attractions.This is an excellent collection, made all the more appealing by the realization that they were collected by a couple who knew the artists. We had a 20-minute wait to get in, but it was well worth it. Most come for the Monet displays (which are well worth it), but this museum has a whole lot more."

One thing that made it most enjoyable was the natural lighting from the skylight used for illumination. In addition, we were pleasantly surprised at the works of others here, especially Renoir and Picasso. Yes, the Orsay has greater number of Impressionist works, but for true art lovers and especially aficionados of this genre, do not miss this museum. And to correct some of the uniformed lesser rated reviews, you can take photos as long as no flash is used. Although, I did partake in this amusing activity (MHO), at least half of the visitors did.

This place gives you the freedom to sit and be enveloped by Monet's water lilies, and also to get up close and personal with Soutine. Unlike at Musee d'Orsay (which I do also recommend) and the Louvre, you do not have to peer around people 5 deep to get a glance at one of your favorites. Every time I have visited, I have been struck by how uncrowded it is, which I think is more a testament to the crowd control than the to the popularity of the museum, since there is often a line to get in. Holders of the Paris museum pass do get to hop the line, which to me is alone worth the price of the pass."

When I was last here twenty or more years ago it seemed that this museum had yet to be discovered bu ttoday the crowds have found it - go early!"

Maybe a little pricy for such a small location, but it is a little haven, well worth stopping into and imagining what Giverny must have been like when Monet was there. We may have all seen Water Lilies elsewhere but it is quite a different think to enter a room and be surrounded by them."

It was worth the visit simply to see these, but we hadn\u2019t appreciated how amazing the Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume Collection located in the basement of the Orangerie is. The collection consists of 25 Renoirs and 15 Cezanne\u2019s along with many paintings by Matisse, Picasso, Rousseau\u2019s and other contemporary (to them) artists. We had allowed ourselves most of the morning for our visit but it was insufficient time to take in all the paintings and we will have to return. On the occasion we visited, a Thursday morning in July, the gallery was quite quiet for most of the time. We also hired an audio guide whilst we were there and found it to be of excellent quality with just the right amount of information about each painting."

On the top floor there are two large rooms specifically constructed for this purpose - each containing water scenes by Monet. Each canvas is large - roughly 10 feet tall and 40 feet long. The bottom floor is just as impressive in another way. The bottom floor contains the art collected by a dealer / artist representative / friend Paul Guillaume. The fact that he collected this body of work is amazing. And the works are normally arranged so that all the work of a particular artist is clustered together. in several cases, there are painting of artists such as Renoir and Cezanne in this collection that are duplicated by essentially identical but larger pieces in d'Orsay. Also, the museum normally has a special show of an artist who is not part of the permanent collection.Because the museum is not crowded, there is far more time that you can spend looking at the works of the collected artists. The one thing the museum could use would be more benches to sit and spend time admiring the wonderful collection."

The space in this museum was designed by Monet for the water lily paintings he was working on - the light, shape, size, were all what he wanted. It makes for a great experience to walk into the two rooms and see the paintings just as he envisioned them to be displayed. They are 6 feet tall and fill almost the entire walls of each room, and I really enjoyed the colors and experience of seeing them. I also appreciate that this museum is manageable - really I only need to see the two water lily rooms. There are also more works displayed downstairs, including Renoir and Picasso, which I did enjoy seeing, but the Monets are the main attraction. We spent 30 minutes enjoying the water lilies and another 30 browsing the rest of the museum. You can get free (and faster) entry with the Museum Pass, and the museum is in the middle of the beautiful Tuileries garden, so if you are able to get over there with the Pas it is definitely worth a visit."

I heard great things about it from a Colleague and saw that it was highly ranked on tripadvisor. It is worth scoping out if you are in the area around the louvre/Tuilerie gardens. This location is included for free access as part of The Paris pass, there also wasn't much of a line. The main attraction is the large water lily canvas paintings by Monet (these are on the main level). Downstairs are painting by other artists, personally I didn't find them that impressive especially when you consider the quality of musee d'orsay.  The other negative was that since I visited in July the Monet lily rooms were very crowded and you couldn't get a great look at the paintings as many people were posing for selfies and taking pictures. There was one Asian tourist who was literally posing in front of the same painting 20 minutes later with up friend snapping more pictures when I returned back to the room after viewing all 8 of the large scale paintings. It was just a little frustrating that there weren't that many museum employees around to force people to move on. I noticed that at many of the art museums that tourists just go from painting to painting taking picutres rather than actually looking and appreciating the art.  Again worth going to if you're inmate area and have the Paris pass, but I personally wouldn't pay the fee just for this,mothers are much better museums in Paris. If you're that big of a Monet fan go to the musee d'orsay or musee marmotten."

If you have the museum pass (shame on you if you don't) this makes a great target of opportunity. You'll see Monet's water lily murals displayed as he intended and a very nice small collection of impressionist art. So many museums in Paris have long lines. This one is a joy to visit.

So you can imagine we were quite shocked to find a strict adherence to a no photo rule in place. As a seasoned photographer I am aware that no flash means just that and with good reason. But here we seem to have gone back to kindergarten. We didn't hang around long as the guards seemed really oppressive. Shame as there are some fantastic pieces hanging there. 4x stars for Monet and none for the other bit."

We visited this late in the afternoon. There are two queues; one to buy ticket and one for passes and preordered tickets. The guard let both the queues pass equally for the security line. Might as well be one single queue. After the security check don't join the queue again as this is for tickets if you already have a museum pass. This queue is also for audio guide. Go straight ahead for the Monet paintings. Two rooms and 8 paintings wall to wall. Superb experience.Downstairs you have impressionist paintings and Some works by Picasso. You spend around 1 hour not counting the queue time."

The subdued light from the central windows somehow emphasises the absence of any horizon in the canvases. The gallery below the Water Lilies was pleasing and whilst not all the exhibits in the Walter-Guillaume collection appealed there were some works by artists, who I admire less than others, which were of a quality to make me quite change my mind about them. A Maurice Utrillo for one. I really enjoyed my visit."

Monet designed the space to display large paintings of the water lilies at his garden in Giverny. He worked on the paintings for many years before his death. He meant the L'Orangerie to be his gift to Parisians....a space where the busy Parisian can take a short break from hectic city life and be enveloped in calm and soft beauty. The two main rooms achieve exactly what Monet intended. The emotion I felt sitting on the bench in the middle of each room was simultaneously powerful, transcendental, yet tranquil and reverent. It made the visitor not a mere viewer of art, but an active participant. The L'Orangerie made me appreciate Monet in a way that viewing small canvases of his water lilies and other works could not."

            "review": "One of the most perfect and purest viewing experiences if you love Monet. The small, specialized building was designed to house the late Water Lilies of Claude Monet, who was commissioned to paint them by Clemenceau and to make them work in that space. It is a shrine, with magnificent, oval shaped rooms that surround you and have a naturally lit skylight that brings in filtered sunlight. It is really awe inspiring to sit and take in the work and realize that Monet had a hand in the overall design of this museum.I am a painter and I wanted to take some pictures of the painted surface, since these paintings do not travel and the build up of color and marks --the facture, is amazing in person and a good macro lens will get the whole surface. But no pictures are allowed. Which is probably ok, because it does force you to contemplate with your two eyes, not a lens, and to sit and stare and absorb! Worth multiple visits.  Great location-- walk through the Tuileries--have a coffee and a croissant on the way, and as you leave, end up at Place de la Concorde. Truly picturesque inside and outside."

We did the Louvre for 3 hours in the morning and after lunch decided to walk through the Tuileries Gardens and go the this museum. It is a pretty walk and towards the end head left up the ramp to the museum. With the museum pass we got in right away, a very , very short line and we were in within a couple of minutes. I suggest going on a sunny day so the light will shine in and the colors on the huge water lily canvases will look so radiant. Monet painted the water lilies at many different times of the day,, so it is an interesting study on the way he sees it. This is not a very large museum, but is worth the hour or so it will take you and certainly is very pleasant getting there.. It is very fascinating to look at the lilies up and the far away, as you will see things differently. After Monet there are other Impressionist works here, Renoir, Cezanne, and Matisse to name a few. So if you like this period of painting it is definitely worth it and compliments the Louvre, being short enough to do both in one day."

There were still a lot of people, but that is certainly expected, since it is Paris in the summer!! The entrance fee was \u20ac9, and the audioguide was \u20ac5 (I highly recommend the audioguide!!). When you first walk in, you see Water Lilies. Yes, they are absolutely AMAZING, but they are also insanely crowded. There are so many people walking through there just to take selfies. It is pretty annoying, if you ask me. However, you just can't miss seeing them, so you'll have to put up with the selfie takers!! The rest of the museum is fantastic! So any famous painters have work there. The building alone is worth seeing. I highly recommend seeing Orangerie on your visit to Paris."

Once inside, the first thing you see on the top floor are the lily rooms. I had no idea the true scope of these paintings and I was blown away by how beautifully they were presented. The floor below is a beautiful art museum with works by Monet, Renoir, etc. Look out for a room to the left that does not have any obvious markings - it is a small theater room presenting a history of Money and how his presentation of the Water Lilies came to be.

We were also pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to queue before entering. The Orangerie must be a well kept secret."

It is not nearly as busy as the Louvre and we only waited a few minutes to get in. Lovely small gallery that doesn't take hours to go round. The water lilies are beautiful and so amazing to see up close ( they are huge long curved paintings around an oval room - well actualy 2 rooms). I took my 12-year-old son and he was quite impressed. Despite the signs saying no photos everyone seems to take them as long as there is no flash think they are ok with it."

My daughter is a huge Monet fan so we sat for some time surrounded by water lilies. The gallery on the lower level we went through in about half an hour. There were some nice Renoirs and paintings by painters I wasn't familiar with but nothing that really screamed \"You must go the Orangerie\". The Orangerie is really all about the water lilies and I highly recommend it but you don't need to plan a half day. If you have time for only one, go to the d'Orsay but they are close enough that you could walk from one to the other quite easily."

Anyway, the Orangerie contains Monet's famous landscapes of his garden at Giverny, specifically his water lilies. There is also a worthwhile collection of works by other Impressionist masters. If you are just looking for a quick look at the works, you can do this museum in an hour. There is a separate line for museum pass entrants that will get you in quicker. The two rooms that contain the lilies at various times of the day and year are very busy, but not overwhelming. The works are impressive enough to say that it is worth the diversion to the museum.

As I viewed it I could not help but think that many other painters could have 'done a better job.' However, I did like several of the individual paintings that were hanging on the walls. Isn't it amazing that when it is discovered that, say a Rembrandt - is not a Rembrandt, its price tag drops from 5 million to 200 hundred dollars. It is still the same painting.

After getting lost three times in the Louvre and swarmed by the horrendous numbers trying to be saved by the Mona Lisa we went to the L'Orangerie as a respite. We had a museum pass so I expected to be able to jump right to the front of the line - but they had two lines - one for museum pass holders and ones who had to buy tickets. Security would let a few dozen pass holders get to the door, close that line and then let a few dozen ticket buyers line-up near the door! If they want to encourage pass purchasing let us all in first and then the ticket holders - the process in place kind of undermines the point of having a pass. If you have a daypack or large bag you must leave it at the counter before you enter. Having just come from the Louvre the silence and contemplative atmosphere immediately strikes you. In the Louvre you run the danger of someone running you through with a Selfie stick - here you have to double check that you are not at a silent religious retreat. Unlike the Louvre there are large benches for viewing the Monet Water Lily paintings. While the Monet curved paintings are interesting and definitely calming the real treat for me were the collections of other notable Impressionist artists in the basement. Even some early Picasso's before he started fracturing everything into jagged pieces. Again here it was very quiet and contemplative. Given how close it is to the Louvre and how refreshing it is to body and spirit after Louvre swarmings it is worth a visit if you plan to attend the Louvre."

The only low point of the visit was the security/cloakroom rules and the staff manning them - we had backpacks with us (as we were travelling later that day) and were told these had to be handed into the cloakroom facility on the way in (for security apparently, although having visited the Louvre with no such similar policy it seemed a little heavy handed). We had passports and various valuables with us so asked about the security of the cloakroom and were then told we could keep the bags with us. The whole scenario played out with the only real communication consisting of huffs, sighs and annoyed looks from the lady on the cloakroom desk, which we thought particularly rude and unwelcoming!"

Easy choice, not so easy to get in- we missed the ramp up to it (no signs and a bunch of construction) and ended up circling the building. So you can find it- when facing the Louvre the ramp will go up to the right just after you get in the gates from the Concorde Plaza (or if you're facing the obelisk/pillar, go up the ramp to the left, if you go thru the gates you've gone too far). The entrance is on the west side (a small end of the building facing the plaza) but is a level higher than the plaza or the street alongside it. There was a short line just for the security check, but it went pretty quickly. The rooms with the water lilies are awesome- the guide said it was Monet's intention for the rooms to feel peaceful & be a transition from the hurried life outside- they really achieve that goal if you stand there for a few minutes and study them. We arrived about 5pm and had plenty of time to take in the whole museum before closing."

I've been to Paris many times, so it was neat to see a new museum, but I would advise seeing either the Louvre or the Musee D'Orsay if you only have a couple of days in Paris.

Its truly a masterpiece and like art the museum means something differently to each viewer. You have to see this and marvel at how Monet captured his images and brings them to life in Paris. It's truly a gift to mankind and this is coming from someone who isn't passionate about art."

The museum, which is covered by the Paris Museum Pass, is best known for its incredible exhibition of Monet's Les Nympheas [water lilies]. 8 large oil paintings are displayed in 2 oval shaped rooms dedicated to the exhibit. They are impressive works worth a quick stop. The museum is located in Tuileries Gardens just a short walk from the Louvre. The line was short on a Wedneday afternoon and we got in with just a few minute wait. We visited before a trip to Monet's Gardens in Giverney."

Fortunately we had our Museum Pass, and we were able to get in quickly (we still had to wait in line for security, but bypassed the main line). Once inside, you can enter into 2 oval rooms lined with 8 Monet Water Lilies (Les Nympheas) paintings. The rooms themselves are beautiful (white, oval, and minimalist) with seating in the middle of the room. The paintings are grand and classic Monet. My husband was unimpressed, and we didn\u2019t spend too much time there. In the basement, there are a few other rooms with a seemingly \u201crandom\u201d collection of artwork. Nothing fantastic after coming straight from the Louvre. In addition, there was an impressive sculpture display that was definitely worth passing through (Adolpho Wildt). Bottom Line: If you are a die-hard Monet fan, than L\u2019Orangerie is a must-see. If you are not, than I would skip the lines at L\u2019Orangerie and head to Musee D\u2019Orsay. The top floor has some of Monet\u2019s most famous pieces, as well as very impressive collection!"

Take a moment before you go in to the Orangerie to check out the series of carved hands set on little plinths on the lookout above the Place de la Republique. They were done by the French-American artist Louise Bourgeois when she was 85, and they\u2019re like a tender prelude before the main event (not that they were intended as such). Then spend lots of relaxing and restorative time with Monet\u2019s waterlilies: two large oval rooms, each with four large paintings under diffused natural light. He put them here to bring solace to Parisians, and the rooms are thronged with visitors, but quite hushed. Big benches at the center of the two rooms let you sit and soak in these glorious artworks; people shuffle round and exchange places in a little minuet of unspoken politeness. We take a slow stroll through the rest of the museum\u2014long corridors of Matisse and Renoir and particularly Derain, from the collection of the famous dealer Paul Guillaume and his wife\u2014and it\u2019s all so calm and reaffirming that I\u2019m reluctant to check out the associated show by \u201cthe last symbolist,\u201d Adolfo Wildt. I\u2019m glad I do. He was an Italian sculptor influenced by Klimt and the Secessionists, and his knack for giving marble an almost translucent look, like flesh almost, invests his yearning, emotional sculptures with a great human tenderness. \u201cI want to sing, not tell;\u201d he said, \u201cto exalt, not describe.\u201d The sense of heroic striving that he gives to the faces and bodies he carves made him very popular; Mussolini\u2019s mistress championed him. This little side show amplifies the dimension of transcendent spirituality that people tend to find in the Monets; in the bustle of Paris, an afternoon of restorative calm."

We went to see Monet's waterlilies, displayed on long, curved walls, to show the different light, from morning to evening. They are beautiful and a unique way to see his work. There are other paintings by Renoir, Cezanne and Matisse. It was not crowded in May and we walked right in. The museum is located on the edge/within the Jardin des Tuileries. It is very easy to find and a great location among many other sites."

Was looking forward to this for years and finally when I did go it was totally worth the wait. If there is any way you can avoid the crowds it would be great - off season maybe. We got lucky. We arrived before the crowds started pouring in, and there were no school groups yet. There are two huge oval rooms where 8 large waterlily paintings by Monet are kept, lit only by natural light. It is simply mindblowing. Try to sit right in the centre of the seats so you can observe the paintings for a while. The best way to enjoy these are to just sit and stare at each of the canvases. Once you finish with the waterlilies, if you think that was all, there is more. There are more impressionist and post impressionist masterpieces waiting for you in the floor below. We bought the Museum Pass from here, as it was relatively less crowded - and in hindsight this was a brilliant idea as most of the other museums have really long queues."

But the line for non-pass holders was a lot longer. When we did get in we agreed it was for the best, since it really helped to keep down the crowds, and allowed us to better appreciate the exhibit."

They say no photos, but if you don't use a flash and are discreet, no one cares. Snap away. Go first thing in the morning to avoid the huge line and tons of people inside. To really appreciate the Monet's, you need to see them when the rooms aren't filled with people. I also recommend traveling to Giverny to see Monet's house before you go to this museum, to really appreciate these masterpieces. When they say they close at 6pm, that means the doors close and no one is inside at 6pm. They won't even let you in 30 minutes before they close."

There are several styles of impressionists on display; Sisley, Cezanne, Sautine, Renoir & Picasso to name a few. A real highlight was the two rooms with Monet's water lilies; the 360 panorama makes it an absorbing experience.What we liked about this museum was that it was small, personal and not particularly busy. There was time to sit, observe and enjoy the beauty of the paintings on display. What a delight; take the time to visit."

The oval rooms in the orangerie were designed for the water lelies of Monet which are absolute master pieces. The basement is dedicated to the Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume collection which has a lot of impressionist and post-impressionist works. I really like to see the evolution in the style of painting. The last part of the basement has a Adolfo wildt exposition at the moment. I only gave it a cursory glance to be honest. I took plenty of time for the previous expositions and I wanted to spend some time outside and grab something to eat."

Downstairs is a nice exhibit of other artists, but they are not typical examples; there are enough of each that one can get a more well-rounded sense of the artist than occurs with a couple of representative paintings. I would visit again in a heartbeat.The museum was crowded, but not noisy - try to figure out when it may be less crowded, as craning around the crowds can be frustrating"

The museum itself is gorgeous - the outside is trees and sunshine (well when I went!) and the inside is minimalist and beautifully designed to allow full appreciation of the paintings. The Monet's were of course the statement pieces and absolutely divine. The gift shop was spacious and had lovely prints and souvenirs and the whole museum was quite quiet and not too cramped. Its major downfall was the visit to the toilets. Almost all of the cubicles were out of order and the drains smelt like they had never been working. There was toilet paper all over the floor and the taps didn't work properly either. The floors were grubby looking and many people walked out.It really didn't make my visit end well - but luckily for them the artwork was definitely worth the visit. Go, see the fabulous paintings but maybe avoid the ladies unless you're desperate."

I visited on one of the many May jours feries here in France, May 8, 2015 so there were a lot of people waiting to get in. The brief wait (10 mins?) was worth it! The two rooms in which Monet's Nympheas or Water Lilies are displayed are peaceful for the most part, designed specifically to showcase these incredible paintings. Signs at the entry to the rooms encourage onlookers to remain quiet, and there are comfortable benches in the middle of both rooms where you can sit and contemplate these beautiful works of art.But don't stop there- there are many delightful impressionist works downstairs, with a nice collection of Picasso paintings as well. There is a special exhibit of works of the Italian sculptor Wildt until July 13th this year. I entered thinking I would simply zoom through it on my way to the museum gift shop, and was pleasantly surprised by his sculptures, some of which were quite large, and most of which had some quizzical feature which caused me to do a double-take. I spent a lovely couple of hours at the Orangerie, and when I left, I headed behind the museum into the Tuileries Garden, and visited the bookstore there. It includes many lovely little offerings, such as a strong collection of children's books in English and in French.NB: You can buy a double entrance ticket good for 3 months that gets you into both the Orangerie and the Musee d'Orsay for 16 Euro-such a deal!"

As wonderful as Water Lilies is, the real gold in my view lies in the unbelievable collection of impressionist works that comprise the greater part of l'Orangerie's collection. Degas, Van Gogh, Matisse, Utrillo, Derain, Modigliani Manet, Satine and on and on. If one has any interest in the art of this period, one can fill one's self to overflow.

On the lower level of the museum, we found a wonderful exhibit of some of Renoir's best portraits. Don't miss this museum if you are in Paris.

Going to the Louvre or the Orsay each time you go to Paris is unlikely, but this museum is worth a visit each and every time you go to Paris, as every time it never ceases to amaze and it is small enough to not be bombarded with too much art.

Monet's water lilies are over two rooms, the paintings wrap themselves around the room, it's hard to appreciate the paintings when it's so busy but I would take the advice of others and get there early and just sit in peace and quiet and drink in their magnificence. Most visitors are there to see Monet but don't miss downstairs there is a large interesting display of artists. whne you've finished take a wander around the lovely park, or sit on one of the many free chairs or benches and have a picnic.

Part of the pleasure is to see Monet's \"Water Lilies\" in a space specifically designed for them. They are huge canvases, and to be appreciated they need a huge space for viewing. At the Orangeries they are displayed as the artist wished, and the presentation is exceptional. On the floor below, the display of the art dealer Paul Guillaume personal collection is also one not to miss. It is an amazing collection of Impressionist and Post Impressionist works. It is hard to imagine living with these paintings on ones walls, but the dioramas of his office and apartment give some idea of what it was like.

The Museum Pass holders get to go first, so we only waited about 2 minutes to enter. That makes it much nicer than the craziness of the Louvre and to a lesser extent, d'Orsay which get crowded. The two main rooms each have 4 massive Monet murals of the Japanese gardens, and you just sit there and stare at them and take it in. I highly recommend it, unless you don't like Monet for some reason (like my husband who skipped it)."

Those paintings are on the upper level and are the reason most people come to this museum. However, I love the art collection downstairs, donated by the widow of two art collectors. Many impressionist paintings, and many paintings of more modern art schools. I never miss this. Get a Paris museum pass to avoid the mine."

There is an impressive and varied collection including Renoir, Modigliani, Matisse, and yes, more Monet. We started with this collection, and then worked our way upstairs to the masterpieces that are Monet's \"Nymph\u00e9as\"-the eight Water Lilies murals. I recommend doing it in this order, because, if you're like me, you will hardly be able to pull yourself away from the incredible Water Lilies rooms."

The installation of the Guillaume collection with supporting photos and documents is very interesting, with several stand-out paintings, but of course the main attractions are the Monet cycles of water lilies. No matter how you feel about impressionism, these late ensembles of Monet's are literally breathtaking in their restored setting.

The two rooms housing Les Nymph\u00e9as are some of my favourite spaces in Paris and I try to return every time I am in the city. The museum was closed for six years while it's renovation and redevelopment was halted by archaeological discoveries, but reopened to reveal the 8 paintings by Monet now bathed in natural light. The only down side is the popularity of these rooms: I would strongly recommend seeing the works as far outside of the tourist season as you can as in my experience being able to enjoy the paintings in relative peace with only one or two other people is a vastly different to jostling to see them in a crowd. You'll soon see from the length of the queue that can wind it's way out of the museum's front doors what your experience is likely to be."

The Murals are gorgeous and how wonderful to see them in 2 curved rooms. Saw a number of Renoir's I had never seen before. Small museum so you can easily fit it into your schedule. I went at the end of the day and had to wait only 10 minutes until the security checkpoint."

When you have walked through the Tuileries Gardens, head to your left to visit the L'Orangerie, a small but very precious and very impressive collection of Monet water lilies. The rooms are austere and the walls lined with huge wall size murals of gardens and water lilies. The beauty is extraordinary and fills one with a sense of wonder and a feeling of peace and serenity that is indescribable. Sounds corny in writing but once you experience it, you will surely understand. Not to be missed!"

The best part about it is that it has a small, well-curated collection of Impressionists that is worth seeing in its entirety. No worrying that you're missing the \"good\" stuff or just getting plain worn out by feeling obligated to see an entire museum such as the Louvre or the Musee d'Orsay. I also love Impressionist paintings, so that helped! If you don't like that style, skip this museum.We visited on our last day in Paris - our flight actually left in the late afternoon, so we had time to eat breakfast, visit the museum, and still make it back the hotel before checkout. With allowing ample time to view the entire collection, we probably spent 1.5 hours here. It was a good museum to visit with our baby too, since he can handle being inside without being fussy for about that long. The musem also was not crowded at all. I'd read a few reviews that mentioned long lines, but we walked right in. I visited this museum 7 years ago when I was here (in May that time) and also don't remember any lines or crowds. A very nice change of pace from the Louvre and the Orsay.The one thing I didn't like is that the bag/coat check counter is before you have to show your ticket - so if you will need *anything* from your bag - bottle of water, or in our case, diapers, burp cloth, etc - make sure you bring it in with you. Although we did ask if it would be ok to go back out to our diaper bag and bring it back in and they were fine with that.*if you like my review, I hope you'll click the 'helpful' button; those of us who write reviews love to get them and it motivates us to do more :) *"

The first floor of this converted hot house for oranges is the home of the breathtaking Waterlillies by Claude Monet. They were to be a place of peaceful reflection after the horror of World War 1. Words cannot describe the sense of peace as you walk into the first room. Stay here and bask for a while in the bench provided. I went in the late morning on a Thursday in early March so the museum was not crowded at all and I was able to take a seat and move to the different views as I chose. The only real noise in the room at the time was a little art history class being taught to five children about aged 12. The teacher spoke ever so softly. There are no photographs allowed in this section of the museum and nobody tried to take any so I don't know if the personnel on either side of the room would have said anything. I then went to the second room and my brain found it even more peaceful. You can stay in here as long as you would like. I lingered a while and decided to go see the paintings on the second level. I wasn't really expecting much....I was wrong. This collection of paintings is the gift of art dealer Paul Guillaume and his wife Domenica. It is a staggering personal collection of paintings by Renoir, Cezanne, Rousseau, Modigliani, Laurencin, Derain, Picasso, Matisse, Utrillo and Soutine. There are 25 paintings just by Renoir. The museum is much smaller than some of its sibling sites but it is no less impressive and one you should not miss. in this edition of the museum photos may be taken.Some overall advice if you go. First pay the 5\u20ac and get the audio guide. One gets so much more out of the experience if context is given. Many of the paintings have information on the audio guide. If at all possible try to go this museum alone or just with your family or friend. When I went back up to the Waterlillies room after viewing the downstairs collection I sat in a room with probably 15 people in complete silence. We were all silently gazing, occasionally changing seats and enjoying the peace. In came a tour group like a heard of buffalo into a field of little butterflies. They were extremely disruptive in their noise and wandering. They weren't there long but I point this out because I do not see how one could possibly get the depth of this place in a group. As a group this is just one more thing to check off on the list...Arc de Triomphe, check, Mona Lisa, check, Venus de Milo, check, Waterlillies, check. If a group is the only way to see it then so be it but just go knowing you won't experience this place the way it was intended.

We could walk up to the short line for entry. The audio guide is worth renting. Its only for the permanent collection so you are n your own for the visiting exhibits. The Monet rooms of the L'Orangerie have been on my must see list for years. There is nothing that can prepare you for stepping in to the first 360 degree oval room of water lilies. Talking crowds fall silent as they enter the room. We walked to look up close up first and then sat on the benches to take it all in. Then we entered the second oval room. Viewing both rooms was very emotional for me. Print and film can't do the color justice. The natural filtered light is perfect for viewing these rooms. The lower level of the museum features some impressive impressionist big hitters. More works from Monet are on display. Restrooms are on the lower floor."

The Orangerie was top on our list for museums this time, and it did not disappoint. We mostly went to see Monet's water lilies, which are in 2 rooms purpose built to display this art. These are large canvases that must be seen in person to get the full affect. In the basement, there was also a nice collection of impressionist art. We liked the smaller sized museum because it was less intimidating and tiring."

It houses a permanent display of Monets Water Lilies murals which cover two whole oval rooms especially designed in the 1920s to house them. You can sit in the centre and take in the peacefulness. The guards are a bit more overbearing than they were on my previous visit, watching out for cameras. The downstairs area houses Renoir, Picasso, Cezanne, Guillaime and many others. Small but gorgeous gallery. Tickets easily available at the office."

For me the experience was also more valuable as I have been to Monet's house in Giverny, Vernon (which is closed in winter). Being in the place that inspired some of his most famous paintings was an increadible experience as you get to understand both, where we took his inspiration from, and also what a genius he was by being able to translate the beauty of his gardens into magnificent paintings.If you are a Monet fan, I also suggest visiting Muse\u00e9 D'Orsay, and if you are going during summer seasons, Giverny."

It's impossible to describe the impact of these enormous murals, and they give the viewer an understanding of the true meaning of Impressionism - a single, snapshot impression of a landscape at one particular moment in time. It's wonderfully serene to just sit and take it all in. I highly recommend a visit to L'Orangerie."

We visited with our adult daughters, the younger of whom had free admission as she was under 26 years old. I was overwhelmed by Monet's masterpieces. Having visited Giverney, it made the whole series of waterlily paintings even more personal for me. They are huge in scale and must be amongst the most beautiful paintings I have ever seen. There are many more impressive paintings in the museum but for me it was all about the waterlilies. This visit made my 60th birthday a memorable one and I will never forget the shivers which ran up and down my spine as the first of the paintings came into view. Please don't miss this museum. I'm only sorry I didn't go there msny years ago."

Many works by a variety of great artists, from Renoir and Cezanne to Soutine and Picasso, Utrillo and Emile Bernard.

It is Simply Stunnning! One can also see some beautiful works by Matisse, Picasso, Renoir, Rousseau, Cezanne, Sisley etc. While the Louvre is amazing, it can be overwhelming, so if searching for a truly intimate and inspiring experience visit the Musee de l'Orangerie in the beautiful Tuileries Gardens - it is located right next to the Place de la Concorde."

We queued for maybe half an hour to get in, with our museum passes (much longer queue for those without tickets).The main focus of this museum is always going to be Monet, whose Nympheas are stunning - you can take your time to look, and look really really closely too. Who knew that these giant paintings were made up of so many colours? From photos on the internet or in books you can only grasp a sense of what these paintings are like. In real life they are truly amazing - flashes of blue, purple, orange or green in the water, which you can only see when you're standing just inches away.I had known that Monet painted these paintings here in situ, but I did not expect to see his brushstrokes where they went out of the painting and hit the frame by accident. After I went home I looked in a book and saw photos of Monet in one of the rooms with a half-finished painting. Just amazing!The gallery downstairs just seemed like an extra addition to the Monets, although it did contain some Renoirs and Picassos. But to be honest nothing compared to seeing those giant Monets."

It became a museum in 1921 and contains work from (post)impressionist painters like Monet, Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso, Renoir, Rousseau, Soutine, Utrillo and Paris born English artist Alfred Sisley. The museum is most famous for housing the eight water lilies murals by Claude Monet. Two galleries were purposely built to display the eight donated water-lily paintings known as the Nymphs (1915-26). Monet created the effects of his masterpiece with many hundred minute brush strokes.Taking photographs isn't allowed and I would recommend buying tickets on line to avoid the long lines."

It is also located near the Pont de la Concorde in one direction and directly across from the Place de la Concorde in the other direction. The museum has the famous Water Lilies exhibit upstairs and the Walter-Guillaume Collection in the lower level. All of the works in the lower level once belonged to Paul Guillaume, a Parisian art dealer and friend of many of the Impressionists.I went with my wife on a Wednesday afternoon in late October and really enjoyed touring this interesting small museum. We went primarily to see the Monet Water Lilies but ended up enjoying the Walter-Guillaume Collection more. This amazing collection includes works from Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, Matisse, Picasso, Modigliani and others. The Water Lilies are huge and it is impossible to understand how big they really are until you see them in person. The huge paintings are displayed in two oval rooms that make it easier to take them in.The museum was not very crowded but the line to enter was pretty long. You have to be in the museum before 5:15 pm and we got in at about 4:45 (so we were getting a little nervous that we were not going to get in). There are two lines outside the building, one for general admission and the second for Paris Museum Pass holders. They offer an English speaking guided tour but we did not get there in time for that so we just did a self guided tour.Overall I enjoyed this interesting small museum and recommend it. It is an easy museum to visit due to its convenient location and small size. This museum is interesting but I would not put it on your itinerary if you are visiting Paris for the first time (unless you are a huge art lover)."

There was a long queue and it was once inside that we found that this was because it was a Sunday, when entrance is free. So we navigated the many small rooms of 19-20th century paintings by painters with whom we were familiar and felt quickly drawn into the world of the impressionists, of Montmartre, of Paris street scenes of a hundred years ago. After the brilliant but oppressive religious inspirations that dominate much of the Louvre, I think both my son and I found this utterly refreshing.Was this all? Oh, of course, there were Monet's waterlilies. So in we went. Again, I was lost for words; had my breath taken away. I hadn't expected this - a whole room (then another) devoted to this wonderful series of paintings. We sat silently, in awe, trying to take it in; I found myself thinking of MIchelangelo and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel nearly five hundred years earlier; art critiques and historians might find this laughable but I was equally moved by the beauty, mastery and integrity of these works. A knockout."

Seats in the centre allow you to rest your Paris walking legs. People watching in these galleries is nearly as good as the artwork. Boy oh boy some people have themselves on.We had two teenagers and easily sat (moving around the rooms) for 20 minutes in each room. The artwork is special but it is the setting that makes this museum as must see. After being upstairs for a while we headed downstairs to The Walter-Guillaume Collection, a very well set out easy to view collection of paintings.A great sized museum, easy to get around, good gift shop and the toilets have to be used to be believed."

A wonderful experience, close to the 'panorama' paintings which were popular in that era.

What a gift to the people of France Monet gave when presenting these for display. But in addition to the waterlilies, the downstairs of L'Orangerie has an excellent small collection which was the life's work of two different collectors/dealers. Paul Guillaume was a great friend to the impressionists, and there are several portraits of him and of his wife. Perhaps these were gifts in payment for services rendered? Regardless, this is a lovely collection of Renoir, Cezanne, Picasso, Matisse, Rousseau, Derain, Utrillo, Laurencin, and a sizable collection of works by Chaim Soutine.

We usually get overwhelmed by most museums given the vast and diverse collections that you get to see (hello, Louvre!)...this museum is much smaller compared to most and thus enabled is to really appreciate and soak up the beautiful work that is Monet's water lilies. The whole set-up is just impressive where you have the paintibga mounted in a room with sunlight streaming through. I've read that Monet designed the setup himself but didn't live to see it. In any case if in Paris, don't miss this, especially if you have done the smart thing of getting the Paris museum pass. We used the pass and were inside in minutes. Note, bags are checked on entry."

At Southwest corner of the Tuileries Gardens by the Place de Concorde, is a relatively small museum. In 1922 Claude Monet signed a contract to provide the French with 8 huge panels of Water Lily paintings. The decision was made to build two large oval rooms on the East End of the Orangerie to house these panels. Now these two oval rooms are quiet, simple with some benches in the middle and you are surrounded in each room by the four long canvas panels depicting the water lilies and water gardens. The rooms are very peaceful, and visitors quietly sat or stood and enjoyed the paintings. Of course, on other floors, there are numerous other famous paintings including the entire collection donated from Paul Guillaume which included Renoirs, other Monet's, Picasso's, and many other impressionist and post impressionist paintings. For a Monet or impressionist fan , this is a must-see museum."

I think Monet painted like 150 water lilies paintings in his lifetime, but if something's working for you, I say go with it. These are huge and impressive, but they aren't his best water lilies paintings, in my humble opinion. But definitely something you need to see. While the Monets are definitely the main attraction, there is also a nice museum of works by other impressionists downstairs. If this were anywhere besides Paris, this would get five stars easily.

Sitting in front of each one and absorbing it, feels like being absorbed by the lake itself. I could sit and gaze for hours. The gallery of impressionist paintings on the floor below is also worth seeing, with Picasso, Renoir, Cezanne - to name but a few- it is a perfect introduction to the style, just enough and not many. There can be long queues to get in so it pays to buy tickets in advance - but you can be just lucky and stroll right in - we did on our second attempt. Metro Concorde."

These are 8 panels that form large wall murals, The space was specifically designed for the murals, including input from Monet himself and they are displayed to their absolute best, If you are in the area and have a about an hour to kill it is worth a quick run through with most of your time spent int he 2 oval rooms!"

Here you are able to just take in 8 pieces of art at a slower pace, indulge yourself in what his intentions were and discover more on your perception of tranquility.

It was hard to find but when I did, I returned three times because I enjoyed it so much. I was with my boyfriend, now husband, and he enjoyed it as much as I did.The large panels of water lilies and the way that it was displayed was just so calming to me. I walked around the rest of the museum but the water lilies are the main attraction. The room can be packed but it doesn't take away the beauty of the art. You can't take pictures and there are people in there to prevent you from doing it. I highly recommend the Paris museum pass. You skip the long lines and get unlimited access to most of the museums in Paris. There are two lines to enter, if you have the pass, you're in the short line and get in in no time at all."

However, since there was a special exhibit going on, in which we had no interest in seeing, we had to wait more than a half hour to enter. However, those without the Museum Pass or reservations, had to wait hours. This museum has Monet's water lilies series of paintings. The rooms were designed specifically to accommodate these beautiful paintings. Definitely worth a visit."

Covering the walls of two large, oval rooms, you are surrounded by a master's work. I recommend you not only sit on the provided couches to admire from afar, but also step closer into the middle of an arch panel and 'immerse' yourself in the view. Not taking anything away from the amazing pieces in the galleries on the floor below, this is a museum that is wonderfully Monet."

Be sure to check the opening/closing times and days before planning youre visit. Arriving earlier in the day will help you avoid long lines and having to wait outside.I would definitely recommend this, especially to those who love Monet and the Impressionist Movement.

It amazed me how these impressionists works convey that feeling. The museum is well worth the admission price and your ticket can be purchased in combination with one for Musee d'Orsay saving a second wait in line (though the line was not long the morning we visited.)

There was so much wonderful art to see and the queue to get in was less than 30 minutes and it is small enough to see everything in a few hours without getting exhausted from dealing with crowds. It has a nice little shop too and the location is beautiful near Concorde and the Tuilerie gardens. My favorite touristy thing by far!"

            "review": "Perfect Setting For Monet's Water Lilies. While not as popular as the other art museums in Paris, l\u2019Orangerie offers Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces with less crowds.Two oval rooms wonderfully display the highlight of the gallery, Claude Monet's Les Nymph\u00e9as (Water Lilies). Each room holds four curved canvases, encircling you in Monet's gardens at Giverny. If you can view the works without large crowds, these rooms offer a lovely place to sit, rest and contemplate the beauty around you.While Monet is the headliner, other artists grab your attention in the lower level gallery. Works from Alfred Sisley, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Henri Matisse, Maurice Utrillo and Andr\u00e9 Derain add to the impressiveness of the museum. All of these works once belonged to Paul Guillaume, a Parisian art dealer and friend of many of the Impressionists. Thankfully, the collection of Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume is accessible to the public in this intimate setting.Conveniently located in the Tuileries Garden (beside the Louvre), l\u2019Orangerie originally housed orange trees for King Louis XIV. The structure has been modified many times, with the most recent renovation completed in 2006. The added skylights filter natural light onto Monet\u2019s Water Lilies, emphasizing the beauty of light Monet sought to capture in his works.Photography is not permitted in Les Nymph\u00e9as, but is allowed in the other galleries.Admission is included in the Paris Museum Pass, or can be purchased individually for 9 Euro. Note that there are two lines outside the building, one for general admission and the second for Pass holders. The Paris Museum Pass will allow you to bypass the ticket line, but not the line to enter.Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie is closed on Tuesdays, and is crowded on Mondays since the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay is closed."

However it's so much more.On the ground level there are two circular rooms, each with 4 of the murals. These are beautiful. There are no windows into this room so you are totally surrounded by the murals and the atmosphere is very serene. There is seating in the middle of the rooms where you can spend time soaking up the paintings.There is also a basement area to the museum with other impressionist artists. When we visited there was an exhibition of Emile Bernard paintings.L'Orangerie is a little gem of a gallery. Well worth a visit!"

This museum is known mainly for Monet\u2019s \u201cLes Nymph\u00e9as\u201d, and it is true that the two oval rooms are quite impressive with the sheer size of these 8 water lily murals. The Monet paintings are straight ahead when you walk in, conveniently close to the entry so this could be a time saver if you are in a hurry. I don\u2019t know how so many people have take photos of these Monet paintings based on the previous TripAdvisor reviews. They were just sneaky and/or lucky, because there is a sign saying no photos are allowed and the museum staff was definitely watching during my visit. It is interesting to admire these lovely paintings from afar and then upon closer inspection look at the seemingly mishmash of colors and brush strokes. If you are particularly a Monet lover, then don\u2019t miss the small but wonderful Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet in the 16th arrondissement of Paris.You can take photos elsewhere in the museum except at the temporary exhibits and also of the glass ceiling entry area which is interesting architecturally but I was told to stop taking photos in the entry because the architect doesn\u2019t like it?! L\u2019Orangerie was originally built in 1852 but was closed from 1999 \u2013 2006 for renovations. There are many other paintings by great artists such as Picasso, Renoir, Matisse, Soutine, etc. worth admiring in this human-sized museum. These other paintings and temporary exhibits are all downstairs. I saw the Emile Bernard (1868\u20131941) exhibit, which is running through 5 January and it was very interesting.Of course this museum doesn\u2019t replace going to the Mus\u00e9e D\u2019Orsay, but it is a nice little museum if you have already done the big one, love Impressionist and post Impressionist art and are looking for something else to do. It is conveniently located in the Jardin des Tuileries near the entry next to Place de la Concorde.I went at 11h00 on Saturday, 1 November (French Toussaint holiday) and walked right in, no lines. I think this place gets busy during high tourist season and since it is fairly small they make people line up outside and then only let in so many as others exit. They have a very small bookshop onsite. Depending on your interest and if you use an audio guide, plan to spend 1-2 hours here. Be sur to check out the Rodin sculptures in front of and on the side of L\u2019Orangerie."

One of the little delights of Paris that is most often overlooked is the Musee de l'Orangerie in the Tuileries Gardens, which offers two of the most prestigious art collections you will ever see.The first is Monet's Water Lilies. Called monumental and intimate at the same time, Water Lilies are the masterpiece of Claude Monet, who diligently worked to explore all the variations of light in his garden at Giverny, not far from Paris and a glorious place to visit in good weather. His paintings are on display in two elliptical rooms, which encourage you to \"gaze in endless contemplation\". The second group of gems can be found in The Walter-Guillaume Collection; a project of Paris art dealer Paul Guillaume and his wife in the early 20th century. A unique collection illustrating the creative work of early 20th century artists, like Picasso, Soutine, Derain and Marie Laurencin, who Guillaume often supported financially and through shows of their art, as well as two of their predecessors, Renoir and C\u00e9zanne. The entire collection was given to the French State in 1960. Some gift! Don't miss it..."

Eight are displayed in two beautifully constructed oval shaped gallery rooms with diffused natural lighting and are extraordinary. You can walk right up to them to examine the brush strokes and technique of the artist. I also loved the special exhibition of Emile Bernard paintings on the bottom floor. An overlooked Impressionist artist finally getting his first solo exhibition in a major museum. And I loved seeing the permanent art collection, also on the bottom level. It is the personal art collection of an art collecting couple, he one of the greatest gallery dealers from the early part of the 20th century. 145 works I believe, many by artists that I really wasn't previously familiar with. And all beautifully displayed. We went to this museum one hour before it closed on a Saturday and waited only about 10 minutes to go through security. (We had a Museum Pass.). Of course, I would have liked more than one hour in this premier museum ."

Monet at the beginning, but Renoir, Picasso, Utrillo, Modigliani, and many others I was unfamiliar with before visiting.

Downstairs is the permanent exhibit of the 150 pictures gifted by the widow of the leading art dealer and collector Paul Guillaume (who later married well to Mr. Walter, hence the Guillaume-Walter gift). These paintings include a host of Renoir, Picasso, Matisse, Cezanne, Rousseau and others. But on top of that, the museum has space for special exhibits, and currently has the first French exhibit dedicated solely to Emil Bernard, a famous painter and art critic. It is well presented and documented and a fascinating learning experience. Lots of information and a fun couple of hours. It bodes well for future return trips for other work of museum personnel."

Monet's water lily paintings encircle two large rooms, displayed in a way that the artist intended. I must say that I have seen several Monet water lily painting exhibits that included some of his other works also. The water lily wall paintings did not produce the awe in me that other exhibits did. However, there were two other exhibits in this museum that were very interesting to see and made the visit better, one exhibit of Bernard's work and the collection of an Impressionist art dealer. The dealer's collection contained a large variety of works, including some by Matisse and Picasso. The museum was not enormous and that was a plus because, we tend to overdo when seeing museums."

You are literally surrounded by very large canvases and need to take time to really see it. On the lower level however you will find a private collection of late 19th and early 20th century art that is worth seeing. The museum also has temporary exhibits and we were lucky to have visited it during the retrospective of Emile Bernard. A less known contemporary of Gaugin and Cezanne but in my opinion a marvelous artist. This particular exhibit will be there till January 2015."

However make it downstairs, see some Picasso, Chagall. I love Monet, I love gardens but I enjoyed seeing Giverny much more, live and in person and the other art downstairs was much more appealing to me but you must appreciate what it took for Monet to paint these pieces in the day and age in which they were created. No pictures and be silent. If chatter gets too loud you will be asked to quiet down. To experience art, it to appreciate it then go out to a local caf\u00e9 for food and wine and talk about it."

The L'orangerie has a beautiful collection of Monet's very late work on Waterlillies. These are huge panoramic paintings. There simply isn't a photo, postcard or book that can do these paintings justice. They simply glow, and give you a sensation of the light in nature rather than an accurate depiction of structure. After the Monet you can wander off downstairs and there are a variety of works by the very famous (Picasso, Renoir, Pissaro) and the temporary exhibition is also included in the entrance fee. A truly lovely little gallery. The first time I went to the Orangerie, was before a night out meeting up with friends!

I went there alone and truly enjoyed the display of Claude Monet's water garden in a building built for these paintings and showing them with natural light. It is possible to sit in peace and regard each painting. It is possible to walk right up close and study the master's brush strokes. The display of other impressionists downstairs was an added attraction AND the garden related bookstore nearby was sheer delight. A wonderful morning."

To be able to sit and gaze upon this works in their intended viewing spot was amazing. I was really glad that the museum was part of the Paris Museum pass. The pass has enabled us to see so many places & most importantly avoid any of the lines to get in. The museum is fairly expensive to get into, and if you are not an avid Monet fan I am not sure if it would be worth it to go it considering there isn't a whole lot else to see there."

Located in the West corner of the Tuileries Gardens, Musee de l'Orangerie was built in 1852 to shelter the orange trees. In 1927 Monet's monumental panoramic murals, \"Water Lilies\" ,which he had painted in his garden at Giverny, were installed. It's breathtaking especially if you've been to Giverny. After your tour of the Orangerie, go for a walk in the Tuileries Gardens and savor what you've just seen. Truly inspiring!"

And so, with his oversight and blessing, this museum became the prime venue to see his Water Lillies as he wanted them to be seen!The museum, damaged by WW II bombing in 1944, was finally restored and reimagined in the 1990s to really present these master works in the best possible setting and light. This museum, therefore, is a highlight of Paris art and architecture.To round out the experience, the entire collection of Monet's art dealer Guilliame has been housed here, and this is one of the more elegant collections of impressionists and pre-impressionists who influenced modern painting.Modigliani, Cezanne, Picasso, and other lesser known but significant painters, are well represented and presented here.What we love about this precious place is the smaller size, allowing one to swell and fully enjoy without feeling that one is missing something. The Louvre is overwhelming, the D'Orsay is fabulous but crushingly crowded, but the L'Orangerie is quiet, magnificent, and the most wonderful of museum experiences while in Paris."

It houses the art collection of Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume which include works by Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso, Renoir and Modigliani among others. It is most famous for the two galleries which house Monet's les nympheas, the water lilies. Monet supervised the design and construction of the galleries. There is a history of this (in French) as you approach the two galleries.We visited mid-afternoon on a weekday. We purchased a joint ticket, 16 euros, for entrance to the Musee d'Orsay and the Musee de l'Orangerie. The ticket is to be used within four days of purchase. The museum was not crowded at all and is easily seen in two hours depending on your interest in art. There is a nice, but pricey, gift shop yet no cafe.My husband and I spent a good deal of our time in the two water lily salons. They are oval rooms with benches in the middle so that you can take your time and drink in the vision and magnificence of Monet. How did he create these masterpieces? Their brilliance leaves you breathless. The salons are silent places of reflection with no photography allowed. There were many guards on duty, yet one in particular was very vigilant in maintaining silence in the galleries. I appreciated his diligence as it allowed you to be alone with your thoughts and the art work. The galleries are on the main floor with the Walter/Guillaume collection on the bottom floor.While this museum may be overlooked on a trip to Paris, it is a must for admirers of Monet."

They are huge, two rooms with the walls covered in the original paintings. You can get so close to them, and they aren't covered in glass, so you can see every tiny or broad brushstroke that he did, as well as the vast range of colours he used.We spoke to a guard there, who was clearly passionate about Monet's work, and he explained that Monet actually designed the gallery, so that his work could be viewed properly any time of the day. A brilliant gallery, in which under 26's get in for free, providing you had suitable ID (driving licence, passport)."

Go if the line is short and you are wondering what to do with your free time near Place de La Concorde."

These two large rooms are oval shaped with one huge canvas on each wall. I had no idea the display was going to be this big. You sit there for hours just looking at them.The rooms with the smaller canvasses were beautiful too. The entire museum had lots of light and was a very pleasant, relaxing atmosphere.

In fact, there were more paintings highlighted on audioguide here than at D'Orsay! We did the whole museum in about 90min at a slow pace taking in almost the entire audioguide (5E - well worth it).L'Orangerie allows you to get away from the masses a little, have a smaller museum to digest, and catch a surprisingly good Impressionist collection in addition to Monet's Nympheas."

When we went to collect our bags I asked the man behind the desk why he had taken our bags, while far bulkier ones were allowed through. He shrugged his shoulders, but the woman standing behind him, who seemed to be senior to him, muttered something about \"best not to engage with difficult people\". So although the exhibition is beautiful, maybe they could retrain their staff, both in logical approach and in courtesy."

Even though L'orangerie is \"small\" it has a magnificent collection that we returned to revisit on our last museum pass day. Monet's lilies are worth the visit. Read about them first so you understand what is special about each panel. A little preparation goes a long way in appreciating. The rooms are perfectly designed to enjoy these magnificent works.

He supported many of the great artists of the early 20th century, including Picasso, Soutine, Derain and Marie Laurencin. His collection (with his wife) is a really stunning study in the beginnings of what we think of as modern art (as well as some great impressionist work). It is well worth visiting and revisiting."

This lovely museum sits in the delightful Tuileries Gardens, you can walk over from the Metro Palais Royale- Louvre station across the park to Place de Concorde, if the weather is nice.The museum's biggest draw is the Waterlilies by Monet. Set in two oval rooms, the canvases are huge, and the audioguides tell us the history of the paintings, painted as they were when Monet was very old. Nonetheless, they are a wonderful sight.You are not allowed to take photographs in these rooms.The audio guide is, in fact one of the most informative I came across in Paris, and there were numerous paintings with full explanations. This could get quite tiring, so that you might find yourself selecting paintings, rather than ploughing through them one by one. I haven't seen so many Renoirs in one place. I also got to know about a couple of other artists whose work I found fascinating. You also get more of a feel for the time scale of the various \"movements\" such as Fauvism, and \"return to order\" - and about the artists who led these groups, tired of them, and moved on. Brilliant and informative. The staff are stern and strict. My husband got told off for getting too close, and he wasn't, really. Then this staff member, she went of to gossip with another \"guard\" and totally became oblivious to others getting far closer to the works. Good toilet facilities, and lovely chairs outside facing on to the Obelisk and the Arc De Triomphe. Traffic roaring but still a lovely Parisian spot for lots of pics!Use your Museum Pass for this one, and you'll get total value out of using the card during your stay."

You walk away with a real sense what it might be like to be imprisoned there. It is good for children as the story is simple and it does not take long to understand. My daughter especially appreciated the story of Marie Antoinette which has all the tragic romance designed to appeal to a pre-teen girl. Worth a trip!"

Lighting in the room changes from sunrise to sunset so you can see the effect of light on the paintings. AWESOME! You can sit on a bench (if there is room) and watch the subtle changes.

Tucked in a corner of the Tuilleries Garden it is a must not miss for painter fans and garden fans alike because nature, light, and flowers that abound inside and out.Easily can be done in less than 1/2 a day, I think this is also probably one of the most overlooked Museums when discovering Paris. You will find many of the early impressionist works here, Monet's huge Garden inspired triumphs and a few Picasso, Van Gogh, Renoir, and Fauvists works too. A perk in particular is a very nice tribute to the extraordinary art dealer, patron, and collector in Paris of the time of Mr. Paul Guillaume. Many of which his collected works are now in the museum.In tribute there is a exhibit section dedicated to Monsieur Guillaume showing in part his apartments throughout Paris and his collections at the time in petite doll house dia-Rama views that are great and will make you drool with envy at what he had on his walls. The kids think they're cool too!Overall a must for lovers of Impressionism and a small petite \"salon\" that makes for a lovely, tranquil, morning or afternoon."

But, apart from the place\u00b4s architecture (specially designed to receive the laaaarge paintings) and the fact that it was a gift from Monet to the people of France right after the end of WWI, in my view Monet has much better stuff to offer in other places like the MET in NYC or even the d\u00b4Orsay or the Marmottan in Paris. But what I really liked about going there today was the Paulo Guillaume collection, ranging from Cezanne to Matisse, and I discovered Soutine, a wonderful expressionist.

All the murals were of the water lily lake in his famous garden and looked very similar. We then took a set of stairs that led downwards to a number of smaller, connected rooms which hosted paintings by a group of artists known as The Macchiaioli. Macchia, meaning \"stain\" or \"blot\" was a group of painters which included Signorini, Boldini, Lega, Picasso, Renoir, Degat and Matisse, amongst others. Originally a term of ridicule, it was later adopted by the group to explain their approach and technique which was a break away from the neoclassical and romantic tradition to a new style with a focus on the outdoors and light.Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and this one thoroughly enjoyed viewing the paintings by famous artists despite not knowing a great deal about art."

We happened to be in Paris on the first Sunday of the month when all museums were free of charge, and ended up in the Tuileries near the museum when it started to rain. When we saw the line was short, we decided to go in. It is small by museum standards but includes 2 rooms of Monet's water lily paintings. It was worth the time."

In summary, it's small but everything is great, especially the Monet lily flowers (\"Nympheas\"). Wonderful! Note: you have to be quiet in the Monet rooms!"

Purchase tickets together with Musee d'Orsay (a short walk across the Seine) at reduced rate.

Rent the audio guide so that you get a full appreciation of the works and their individual stories. I will say this in every Paris review, but GET THE MUSEUM PASS.

We didn't have a choice with travel dates this year though. The Museum's 2 rooms of the water lillies is pretty amazing. You're in a self guided tour so you can take as long or as little as you like. If you're also interested in the Musee d'Orsay, then buy the combo ticket for 16 Euro.

It costs 9 Euro each. It is located in the Tuileries Garden near Place de la Concorde. The hours are Wed - Mon 9:00 - 18:00, Closed Tues.On the main floor is Monet's Water Lillies displayed in two oval rooms. The skylights flood the room with natural light. There are 8 large curved panels of Monet's garden at Giverny. They feature different parts of the pond at different times of the day from pre-dawn darkness, to morning light, to late afternoon and to sunset. Monet worked on these paintings for 12 years (1914 - 1926). By this time Claude Monet was nearly blind. A successful eye operation in 1923 gave him new energy. He completed all the panels, but did not live to see them installed here. In 1927, the year after his death these rooms were completed and the canvases put in place. In the underground gallery there are works by Utrillo, Cezanne, Renoir, Matisse & Picasso from the personal collection of art dealer Paul Guillaume. His wife, Domenica Guillaume Walter inherited them after his death. There are benches to sit and admire these famous works. I loved this collection. So nice to be so close to these world famous canvases. I really enjoyed this museum."

And it works. 10 euro gets you in, zero lines (entrance on the west side, away from the Louvre). Plan on spending an hour in the two galleries, for instance when it's hot outside in the afternoon, and just soak them in. The missing star is because i lost an hour of my life to the rest of the museum. Like I said, I'm not an art person.

There are two oval rooms, you can sit in the middle and enjiy the 360degr view to pure beauty.Unfortunatelly photo is not allowed. After visit to this museum I had to go to Giverny to see the pond with waterlillies by myself."

            "review": "Awe-inspiring setting for amazing art. I had heard that Monet's water lilies were at L'Orangerie, but that was all. I've seen a couple of large paintings at museums elsewhere - in San Francisco at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, in particular - so I wasn't prepared for the canvases he stitched together into huge panoramic views of color. There are water lilies, sure, but mostly there is color - he painted morning light, afternoon light, and dusk, each with its own palette. As remarkable, though, Monet was instrumental in designing the display rooms, which are two large oval rooms with the paintings curving inside the walls, enabling him to position viewers in front of his work and be surrounded by them. It's like surround-sound but with art. There is plenty of bench space, although you might have to wait a moment for a spot to sit and take in the experience. I was expecting other Monet pieces as well, but there are no other pieces (of Monet's) than the large panoramas. On the lower level is a beautiful exhibit of other Impressionist artists - most notably Cezanne, Renoir and Laurencin, among others - as well as an area for traveling exhibits. The gift shop has lots to choose from related to the Impressionists, but does not sell water. The small caf\u00e9 in the museum was closed and the drinking fountains were out of order, so I was forced to get water from the bathroom sink using my cupped hand. That was my only objection to this lovely museum. I'll go again next time we're in Paris - sitting in front of the Monet panoramas is both refreshing and inspiring - but I'll bring my own water."

For me, the lower floor was more interesting, being the personal collection of an art dealer that exhibited various famous early 20th century artists. Overall it might not have the wow factor of Musee d'Orsay or the Louvre, but it is more personal and doesn't take a half day that is the minimum required to do justice to one of the bigger museums."

I wrote a review for the other museum we visited (Musee d'Orsay), so feel free to check that out.There were two combo ticket options: the first was to see the Musee d'Orsay and the Musee Rodin on the same day, or see the Musee d'Orsay and the Musee l'Orangerie within four days of each other. We chose the latter of the two so we could enjoy the works of art.The Musee l'Orangerie is much smaller than some of the other museums in Paris, but it was, hands down, my favorite that we visited. The crowds were much smaller than in the others we toured (d'Orsay and Rodin). What was truly remarkable was the collection of water lilies in their own private few rooms. You could view these gigantic (10+ feet long) works of art in whatever order you would like. They represent all the different times of day that they were painted during. I truly appreciated seeing so many works from the masters - Monet, Cezanne, Picasso, Renoir, and so on. We took about two hours to view the Musee l'Orangerie. We didn't feel rushed at all. I do wish that the museum didn't close when it did. We had just sat down in the movie room to watch a short feature based on Monet's Water Lilly collection."

Regardless of all of the priceless treasures, I just can't enjoy it any longer. Sure I love art, but I cannot spend an entire day looking at masterpieces. I need a break in between.With that said, this museum is PERFECT because it is a smaller museum and you can enjoy all of said masterpieces and see the entire museum within 2 1/2 hours as well!Not to mention, it is very refreshing to see and enjoy non-religious art, which is what you'll find in a majority of the other museums in this city. I understand that during certain time periods, it was illegal to paint anything other than Jesus and his crew, but if you're not religious like myself, all of those pieces start to look the same to me (regardless of how magnificent a piece may be).We decided to go to this Museum spontaneously on our last day in Paris so we stood in a 40 minute or so queue. Many people purchased their tickets online and we should have done the same. If you do buy your tickets in advance, you will enjoy very little waiting.Some of the pieces in this museum are priceless and this should definitely be on your list. Sure we loved the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre (overwhelming but a must do) & the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, but overall I really enjoyed this museum the best (my wife does not agree for the record)."

We first went to see the two salons where Monet's Water Lilies were and enjoyed seeing them. Then we saw the 144 Post-Impressionist paintings in the collection. There were really few people and we were able to see them without a problem. I took photos of all the ones that I liked.I will return to this museum in the future. I have to mention I bought my tickets ahead of time at FNAC."

There are four paintings in each room of Monet's water lilies. I'm not a huge fan, but they were very nice. People say they can stare for hours - I am not one of those people. But the paintings are huge and very nice, especially if you stand back further.Downstairs are more paintings - Renoir and the like. Decent, but I had seen a lot at D'Orsay already so I was good on that. But it was nice. Worth maybe 30-45 minute wait or so? If longer, don't bother unless you really, really like Monet and need to see this."

This time around it was given high priority which means if we missed it again my life would not be worth living. With this in mind on the last Sunday in June we were off early for the short walk from our hotel to the Musee de l'Orangerie arriving just after the doors opened. This early start warranted the effort as to fully appreciate Monet's two rooms of his 360 degree Water Lily's Series you really need time and to sit in the room's central seating to view it at it's optimum. The series are Claude Monet's gift to the French Nation for the World War 1 Victory and a testament to what is good in humans. Beside the Monet Rooms there are other galleries which are also well worth viewing and a Gift Shop well stocked with books detailing the collection. Before we left we revisited the rooms but the moment had gone because the rooms were crowded and unable to fully appreciated. The look on my wife's face was testament to her seeing her Monet Nirvana. This is a must see but please visit early to see it as it deserves to be seen."

This might be one of the smaller museums (great as it is not as crowded as the others, so you have more time to spend with every piece) in Paris but it houses 8 large Monet's that are in two large oval rooms that make the shape of infinity. The room prior to entering the first oval is especially designed to be empty and the rooms use only natural light. There is seating in the middle of the ovals so you are able to sit and absorb the beauty of these immense masterpieces. Make sure to get the audio guide as most of the pieces in the museum have an audio description. The museum has a great collection of paintings by Chaim Soutine. This was the first time that I ever came across this artist and I was pleasantly surprised. As you stare at one, intending to move to the next one, you realize that there is a lot more depth than what you first see. The artist uses bold colors, but grabs your attention with the distorted shapes of the people and objects. Soutine' emotions are clearly shown as his paintings often reveal a tormented soul. "

Call me uncultured, call me unrefined, whatever, I think that art is in et eye of the beholder and while they were nice and pretty spectacular due to their size, I actually found that the other artwork that was downstairs, to be of a greater interest to me. I liked seeing the slightly different styles of the various artists that also seemed to build and reflect off of each other. With the wider variety, of art downstairs, I personally found it to be of a greater interest to me. Go and decide for yourself \u2026 If you agree, vote this as helpful :-) LOL."

To sit in silence and look at each panel was relaxing and thought provoking. You could spend lost time just in reflection of the beauty of the paintings in the round.Bonus was the exhibition below the stairs, but really it is all about Monet for us, a peaceful museum that was not packed with tourists like the Louvre.

There were other impressionist/modern paintings, but they did not rival the artwork in the Musee d'Orsay. I do tend to prefer Classical and Renaissance art, so definitely keep that in mind as you read this review.If you have the Paris Pass, bought a combo ticket with the Orsay, or love Monet, go. Otherwise, I would suggest considering whether the ticket is worth the 9 euro and the long entrance line."

I'm not an art buff, but I've always felt you did not need to be to really appreciate impressionism - and this museum is chock full of impressionist and near impressionist works! Some pieces are most typical of the style, with shapes drawn together by careful dashes of color, and others are more defined pre-, early, and even some post-impressionist works. I am not sure if this is the case, but I felt like there was some other non-impressionist works there too, which I only note as this museum was presented to me as centered on impressionism.Regardless of the exact taxonomy of the works contained, everything flows terrifically from one to the next in carefully curated rooms. Even though I was tired by the time we got to this museum, I was quite happy to visit each of the show spaces in the museum. In fact, this ability to really control the flow of your visit is an advantage for a small museum like this over a larger one, like the Louvre.Monet's Nymph\u00e9as, a two chamber exhibit of eight paintings of water lilies set up to the artist's requirements, is definitely the stand out piece to see. Unfortunately, while these pieces would be spectacular in a moment of quiet contemplation, Paris is one of the busiest tourist sites in the world, and it can be difficult to find the best view for any of one of the paintings. It is a testimony to both Monet and the Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie that, despite the hum of the people, Nymph\u00e9as still can be an emotionally powerful piece.In general, if you like art or impressionist art specifically, this museum is well worth the price of admission. If you're less arty or but like to see some truly unique displays, checking out the Nymph\u00e9as can still make this trip worth it. This museum is pretty much a must see if you have a Paris Museum pass!"

It is included in the Paris Museum pass, which makes it very affordable. It is close to the Louvre, and on a hot day was a beautiful, peaceful respite from the heat and crowds of that museum. The top floor is all Monet water lilies in two incredibly well designed rooms. It was not overly crowded when we visited, but I can only imagine what it would be like to sit in those rooms all alone. The very large paintings conveyed such a serenity. The lower floor showcased a variety of artists who were part of, or influenced, the impressionist movement. Lots of Matisse, Degas, Cezanne, Picasso, etc. I particularly loved a Picasso still life that presaged his movement towards the development of Cubism."

The Museum was crowded, but did not feel overly so--we were able to see all of the art without fighting through crowds of people.Of course Monet's Water Lillies impressed and inspired--it's very cool that Monet himself designed the space in which they could be displayed. It was a reflective experience, being able to see so many of them displayed together. Their scale is impressive and you really do get a feel for Monet's love of his gardens and how light affected them at various times of day.The museum on the lower level was also excellent -- many artists from the Impressionist period and an accessible, manageable collection. A highlight of our trip to Paris!"

This is arguably his most famous/important work; his \"Born to Run,\" to complete the analogy. The gallery setting is absolutely perfect and establishes a calm serene mood and is the perfect blending of gallery and painting into one piece of art. I now know why Monet demanded this building to display this particular art. I know of no other harmonious setup like this anywhere else in the world. I set down for 20 minutes in each room, just to take it all in, which is something I have never done in any art gallery.This display was my favorite of all Paris museums, yes even the BIG ones. Not many people here, quiet and contemplative. This is a must do before any other museum."

After a second failed attempt to visit the Louvre (a delayed opening meant the line was even longer than usual) we made our way to this lovely museum. There were only 10 people in the line so we got straight in. We got audio guides, which gave a lot of interesting history on the different paintings. While it was great to see some Picassos, Renoirs and more, the highlight was Monet's massive water lily canvasses. With two huge oval rooms dedicated just to them, and not many people around, we could stand there and really admire these amazing works of art. We are not normally that into art, but something about Monet's work in general is fascinating, and these paintings are no different. If you cannot stand waiting in line for hours but want to see some lovely pieces of art from some of the world's most renowned artists, head straight for this excellent little museum. You won't be disappointed!"

I had no idea Monet's water lilies were exhibited in such focused splendor: this was a marvel and incredible experience. Two rooms with curved walls show a number of the water lilies panels in both comparison and as the spotlight. Extravagant and yet simple. Then, in a separate part of the building, less famous but just as spectacular paintings left me entranced. When I return to Paris, I will definitely return to this special spot and hope it remains the forgotten stepchild to the bigger museums."

Downstairs are more, normal size, paintings by a variety of Impressionists. We saw a special exhibit here that was interesting and I assume either this exhibit or one like it will persist. It is nice to contemplate these amazing works of art in a more personal and less crowded location than the D'Orsay."

The Musee D'Orsay has an extensive archival collection of drawings and works on paper by various \"masters\" such as Degas, Cezanne, Rodin, etc. The collection I saw runs through June 30th and I got the feeling another collection will go on view after that as the archives is so expansive.

While a bit better than that I do find massive museum collections overwhelming - my back aches and I get antsy. I start to rush and then feel like I haven't really taken anything in.The Musee de l'Orangerie is perfect for us! The 8 Monet \"murals\" give you the feeling you are standing among the water lilies I have been to the real thing and it is well worth seeing but if you are short on time, or simply want to appreciate his talent, you can't miss this one. THe rest of the collection is enjoyable too but nothing compares to those 2 rooms.."

Wanting to see Monet's Waterlilies again after more than a 15 year absence, I remembered this being one of my favourite museums in Paris and it did not disappoint except for one thing: the queue! We must have spent a good part of one hour waiting to be admitted and once through the doors we discovered why, the airport detector/scanner that you had to pass your bags through and empty your pockets repeatedly until the offending item is removed from your body. This issue really needs to be addressed as it spoils an otherwise splendid visit to this enchanting museum. Purposely designed in collaboration with Monet to house his Nymph\u00e9as, they envelop and hypnotise with their expressive abstraction and strong colour sense. Downstairs, the permanent collection of Paul Guillaume resides alongside a temporary exhibition: Drawings from the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (at the time I visited), which has to be one of the most sumptuous drawing collections ever assembled!

Firstly of course the main reason for visiting the museum is the outstanding water lilies by Monet. There are eight of them arranged around the side of two rooms and they really are very well presented with you being able to easily sit in the centre of each room and admire all four paintings. Then downstairs there is a wonderful collection of paintings by Cezanne, Modigliani etc which rival that of the Musee D'Orsay in quality if not quantity. We entered using the museum pass so didn't pay but I did notice that the entrance fee was quite steep and the audio guide probably isn't worth it; impressionist art is for looking at and interpreting, not being told about. Overall a fantastic museum."

The Museum is not very large but it houses paintings of different artists of repute.When in paris I know you must visit the Louvre , but honestly this was my favourite Musee. Must not miss!!"

If you get an audio guide, it tells you all about the art and its collector. There is a number that you can type in to your audio guide next to almost every painting - it is a little hard to keep up with. The room with the Nympheas are extraordinary, and you learn so much about Monet's life. The lower section of the museum is extraordinary as well and I got surprised by the personal lives of some of the artists. The museum is quite small compared to some French museums, but bigger is not always better. There is still so much I have not seen there, and would be pleased to go back."

There is also an impressive collection of impressionist art in the basement which is very diverse and interesting. The whole museum has a calm and approachability not easily found in Paris - It is a welcome break from the Louvre and the d'Orsay which are fabulous, but overwhelming and exhausting. The museum has a particularly lovely, but small, gift shop featuring an unusually tasteful selection of postcards. books, trinkets, and higher end items.HINTS: 1. Try to visit when the museum opens to have some time with the water lillies alone, or at least in a small group. The experience is more powerful when you can sit on the central benches and look around you seeing the lillies without people in the way. 2. If the first water lilly room is busy, go through to the second room - often it is far less busy than the first and you might get some private time there. 3. The Orangerie is covered by the Museum Pass, or by a combined ticket with the Orsay, as well as its own ticket. If you opt for the combined ticket, you DO NOT have to visit both the same day, you have 4 days to visit the second museum."

I wasn't expecting as much from this one, based on the reputation of Musee d'Orsay, but I ended up spending the most time in any one room in the upstairs Monet Les Nympheas exhibit, as any in Paris. Something about the 360 views...grab a seat and soak it in. Fascinating comparing different vantage points, up close, middle, corner, to really appreciate the art."

If you look at nothing else, you must see Les Nympheas - Monet's Water lilies, but I'll come to that in a minute.This museum has a good number of impressionist works on display, by a number of artists. Very interesting to compare styles within the genre. At the time we visited, there was an exhibition of drawings staged, which was fabulous, covering many different styles and a vast array of subject matter. And finally of course, there are Les Nympheas. Simply breath taking - but what I wasn't prepared for was the second oval room, which for me surpassed even the stunning paintings in the first oval room. Having been to Giveny, one could feel the atmosphere beside his lake, under the willows, looking at the water lilies. These works are magical and to spend time sitting with them is a blissful experience.Would say that this museum is a must and also that it is worth a revisit - it's on my list. The only frustration is the queuing system to get to the security and then to the ticket booth, but once past that it's so worth it. Do go."

There is not a lot of art here compared to the other two, so I doubt I would have spent the extra euros to see this museum if it was not covered by the pass. If you do opt to buy the pass, which I recommend if you plan to visit at least Notre Dame, the Louvre, Musee D'Orsay and Versailles, then this is a great museum to include.

The architecture of this small museum is also a treat to behold.The lines for entry were really long when i visited in the late afternoon, took about one hour to get in. I would recommend getting the combined ticket for the Orangerie and the d'Orsay, which will save you time when you go to your next museum (the d'Orsay has huge lines at all times) as well as make a small bargain. If memory serves me right, I think the combined ticket was 16 Euros and lasts for 24 hours, so you can go to the d'Orsay the same day or the next day, like I did.The museum shop is nice to browse and get prints or postcards."

Since it was right in our walking path to the other side of the Seine, and also included in our Paris Museum Pass, we decided to hit it first thing on the Saturday morning of Fashion Week (which was a great idea, because it made for terrific people watching in the Tuileries garden that morning!).Words can't really express how amazing the Water Lilies installations are in this space. They are gorgeous, and I could easily sit on the benches here and just gaze at them and daydream away. Stunning. There are two complete rooms, and it seems like most people get hung up in room #1, as room #2 was far less busy (and to me, contained the better paintings).We did go to the Louvre and d'Orsay, but I must admit - I think some of the best paintings were housed in l'Orangerie. This, plus being MUCH less crowded than the other two big art museums, really provided for a perfect start to our musee-filled day! Renoir, Cezanne, Matisse (drool), and oh my word, Soutine.... You can do this museum quickly and feel very fulfilled in terms of seeing some of the greatest art in the world.Note: Of all the museums, I saw the least kids here . Its VERY quiet in this museum and also rather cramped in terms of space, so I'm not sure this is the best place to take a baby/kid while in Paris."

We had our 9 year old with us, and went through more quickly than we maybe would have without him, however, we saw everything and were in and out in an hour. Not a museum you need to budget a lot of time to experience. (No painting explanations in any other language than French.)"

And the presentation with natural light is a piece of art in itself. Just sit down and contemplate the marvel, take in the colors, the atmosphere, feel the water, the flowers, the slight breeze... Smell the scents. The explanations of how this was all put together are also most interesting. As is the exhibit of paintings of contemporaries. I liked the shop as well.

My fault for not knowing French; France's fault for not doing a better job of providing descriptions in ANY other language. I almost missed much of what there was to see because of the odd traffic flow and lack of signage. Could just be me, but two other people I spoke to in Paris had the same issue.

If you need a reason for getting a college degree in western european art especially French art of the period late 19th century then here it is in abundance. \"Water lilies\" are the origin of abstract art. If you need a reason to become infatuated with art of the Monet here it is in abundance. If you are a fan of Monet's art and his contribution to western European art to say nothing of French art then you must stay here for at least three hours. Small museum to be sure but this is a required visit. Giverny might be the Sistine chapel of impressionism, but his collection has gems that you can not see elsewhere. If you visit the one place you can not be honest with yourself and think of reasons to avoid seeing the is small museum. If you need a reason to attend college and study art of this period here it is in abundance. Forget about bringing the right lunch. Worrying about that is like checking to see if you like the vending machines outside the door of the Vatican museum. Lighting is wonderful. So is the environment or atmosphere. Pre-eminent Monet collection for sure. I do not know why somebody would miss seeing this collection if they spend three days at the other larger museums in this city or elsewhere. Chartres for sure is here in design. Do not get carried away with photographing the water lilies because you might bump into others. Buy a good reproduction.

Monet's monumental \"Decorations des Nympheas\" will astound you and there are other works by Renoir, Matisse and Cezanne to name a few. The tranquility provided in the viewing areas especially designed by Monet is a breath of fresh air and you can easily believe you are in his famous garden. When you visit, buy the DVD that explains the story behind this great gift that Monet has bequeathed us."

This is the only Paris Museum that, on our 10th or so visit, actually has improved over the years, despite the kind of extensive revisions and renovations that have wrecked the nearby Orsay, or the curatorial arrogance and incompetence that has turned the Pompidou Center into a repository of modern garbage while banishing to the vaults the great masterpieces it used to display. We have to thank, firstly, Claude Monet for foreseeing the future of modern art administration and firmly affixing his masterpieces to the walls where they are immune from further interference. Secondly, the Paul Guillaume bequest probably came with very strict conditions ensuring that his treasures would be made available to the public simply and directly, without the obfuscation that thrives in the administrative offices of so many of this city's museums.The Nympheas series is not unique, since Monet has conjured up much of the same magic at the more distant Marmotton Museum, but the quality of the works, their scale and the way they are displayed, and their very number ----- 8 in all, make this the most completely satisfying expression of his artistic vision that he was able to bequeath to future generations. One then has to descend 2 floors into the bowels of the Tuileries Gardens, where, at one end, an auditorium runs a continuous program of short features on the artists whose work you are about to see, and the rest of the space is devoted to the works themselves. Some of the side rooms feature photos and documents describing Guillaume's fascinating life and his dealings with the artists whose work he sponsored. Chief among them --------- and they all get at least one room to themselves, are Derain, Renoir, Cezanne, Henri Rousseau, Utrillo, Soutine, and Picasso ( this latter room was under reorganization and closed to the public, but a number of gaps in construction enabled a sight of many of the great works residing within). The arrows guide you logically and responsibly through the residues of one of the greatest private collections of all time (photographs show many of the treasures that were once part of it). It is refreshing to be able to enjoy these paintings in a Museum that works ---- like clockwork. Remember, there is a combined ticket for this and the Orsay that will save you money, and it is valid for up to 7 days."

We were worried when we only arrived the Museum around 10am, as other reviewers suggested that they had to wait for over 3 hours queuing in the cold in November when they arrived that late. We were sweetly surprised as there were no one at the entrance on a Monday morning in January! The Museum housed the best of Claude Monet's waterlilies kept in 2 oval rooms with natural lights coming from the roof. It was awesome at first sight. We dropped our jaws later, as when we moved around the oval room at different distance and angles to see the pictures we see them very differently. The main tone of the waterlilies was in blue and green, and we were at a loss when there was one picture with patches of yellow in the centre. When we were about to leave and we looked at the same picture at the other end of the room, we then know that he probably wanted to depict the moment of the day, and in this case, the sunset. Nothing so stunning I have ever seen in my life. The collection downstairs are also worth visiting. The pictures by Renoir are exceptional. Do buy the pass for this Museum and Musee D'Orsay when you pay the entrance fee if you are to visit both, so that you can fast track into the other without queuing."

Claude Monet was actively involved in redesigning many of the rooms and he donated the Nymph\u00e9as series of decorative panels painted on canvas to the French government.After visiting the Tuileries, drop in here and be gobsmacked by the extent of Monet's creativity then another day take the train and travel out to Giverny to visit his home."

The original Orangerie gallery was purpose built to show Monet's extraordinary series of panoramic paintings of his lily pond at Giverny. The two elliptical shaped rooms create curved surfaces so when you view them sitting in the middle of the room they surround you with a wave of colour. The overall effect is one of peace and calm - some would say spiritual. They have since Monet's day extended the galleries underground with major temporary exhibition space. These rooms were the opposite to those above them - full of people jostling to see the paintings with great art but little space for sitting to view the work. This is more the norm in art galleries today especially when it is a block buster show - thus making the space and time allowed to see the Monet's even more memorable. Tip - buy a Museum pass to cut down on queuing time to get in - this is a popular venue at any time of year. Remember it is CLOSED on TUESDAYS."

I actually prefer the Monet. This one painting created a bigger impression on us, in so many ways than most of the art we've seen all over the world. It really is truly inspiring and emotional. Get there a bit earlier than opening and secure the front of the queue, go directly to the murals and walk the infinite loop of Monet's mind. It isn't as crowded early.

First of all, the reason I loved this museum was not because of the permanent collection, which is very impressive and I enjoyed it, but because I just so happened to be in Paris during the Frida Kahlo/Diego Rivera exhibit. Frida Kahlo is my favorite artist and I did not know her work was there until we arrived in Paris so I was basically ecstatic when we showed up around nine in the morning to get in line. And then we stayed in line for three hours in the frigid cold and blustering winds of I'm estimating thirty-five mph. It was actually horrible, not like losing your home cable connection for half a weekend horrible, but truly upsetting. In the end it was worth it for me, but I am almost sure my friend loves me a little less because I made us stay in line and she was hardly enthusiastic about the visit to begin with, regardless of waiting time and weather. Here you will find the giant Monets in the stark white oval room that you see sometimes in films, but if it had not been for the temporary exhibit I would have been mad for waiting so long to get in. But impressionism is not really my thing, so take my opinion with a heaping spoonful of salt. If your apartment is wallpapered with a repetitive waterlilies print then by all means go and see this place, you will cherish it. Whoever you are, just make sure you realize you may be in it for the long haul and bring climate-appropriate attire."

I felt like I could spend time gazing at the art without worry that I needed to move quickly in order to see all of the museum. The Frida Kahlo exhibit was amazing with lots of historical and personal information about Kahlo to add context to her art. I highly recommend renting the audio guides."

If you have the museum pass then you can go stand in a different line meant for the pass holders which moves very fast as compared to the Non-ticket holders line which doesn't move at all. Even if you get to the end of the line you will have to wait at the entrance for an eternity in the cold especially as the wind blows strongly in that corner. The security who handles the lines is very unfair to the non-ticket holders because he was not alternating between the pass/ticket holder and the non-ticket holders in a fair manner. As soon as one person comes in the ticket or pass holders line he would stop the non-ticket holder line.The water lilies by Monet is good. One good thing was there was a temporary exhibition of paintings by Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. My wife especially loved the works by Frida Kahlo."

            "review": "World class collection of impressionist and post-impressionist art work. The Musee de l'Orangerie is a wonderful art museum, located at the Western end of Tuileries Gardens. Entry is steep (\u20ac10 for adults) for a relatively small collection. However, what you see is world class, likely one of the finest collections of impressionist and post-impressionist art work anywhere. Musee de l'Orangerie is included in the Paris Museum Pass so if you've bought this pass already, this is a highly recommendable museum to see while in Paris. The highlight of Musee de l'Orangerie is (Les Nymphes) The Water Lilly murals by Cluade Monet, which are kept in oval shaped rooms with a centre seating area. The intention is for this to be an area of reflection and meditation. Unfortunately, some of this is lost with waves of tourists coming and going into the two rooms. However, the concept remains appealing and it is very much worth spending at least 10 minutes in each room focusing on the murals. They do have a calming effect on you, if you allow them to. The museum additionally houses the Walter-Guillaume Collection, which features 144 pieces of early 20th century artwork. Here you can find quite a few works by Renoir, a few pieces by Picasso, works by Cezanne, Rousseau amongst others. There are many outstanding works are to be seen.At present, there is a very good special exhibition, featuring Mexican artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Riveria. This exhibition did a nice job of displaying their works while building up the story of their intwined relationship, passionate and dramatic marriage. You can see the impact this had upon Frida Kahlo's work, particularly. Overall, we very much enjoy Musee de l'Orangerie and recommend it to anyone interested in impressionist and post-impressionist art. You can comfortably visit in 30-45 minutes there or spend a couple hours if you like. Hint: In order to control the crowds, they seem to limit how many people can go into the Musee de l'Orangerie at any given time. This results in some noticeable queues by afternoon, even during afternoon visits in the winter. The queue was well beyond 60 minutes when we visited. If you have the Paris Museum Pass, you are fortunately able to skip this queue and wait much less time to enter the museum."

If you feel overwhelmed by rooms upon rooms of Gallery Pictures and crushed by all of the people crowding around you, go and visit the Musee de l'Orangerie. In 1922, Claude Monet signed a contract with the French government donating his Water lilly panels to be housed under the natural lighting in the two oval rooms of the Orangerie. There are 8 panels altogether and they form a cohesive and contemplative display of impressionistic art from the master. You can walk slowly through the two rooms viewing the waterlilies at different times of the day from dawn until dusk and you can also sit on the large benches in the middle of each room to look at the art. A lovely experience for all ages and energy levels. After leaving the gallery you feel relaxed and not exhausted, as you do when you visit most galleries."

It's a very peaceful and quiet place and the work itself is just stunning. I went on my last day in Paris, when I was a little tired of traveling and fighting crowds and it was nice just to be able to sit in this beautiful quiet space for a while and take a breath.The downstairs exhibit was tiny compared to other museums, but it had some interesting pieces. I also enjoyed their temporary exhibit on Frieda Kahlo and Diego Rivera - well done and one of the few very English-friendly exhibits I encountered (I expected no English at any exhibit, so every time I found it, it was a pleasant surprise).Side story: On my last night in Paris, I ended up meeting a lovely group of American women at the table next to mine and they invited me to join them for a drink (they felt bad that I was alone). They wondered what I did with all my time in Paris by myself, and I told them it was the perfect city for a museum-lover like me to visit solo. It turns out there was one woman in their group who loved museums, but the rest were not interested at all - they had only a short time for their visit and didn't want to spend hours in a museum. This is the museum I told them to go to. It's perfect for groups where some people really want to immerse themselves in a museum exhibit and others aren't into it. You can spend an hour or less here and still fill like you got the full experience."

This is a museum with something of a split personality, due to its galleries with Monet's water lillies, some other collections and visiting displays. It is smaller and less overwhelming than the Louvre or the d'Orsay, and much more manageable for the time-pressed visitor who feels the need to see some art while in Paris, but can not afford the time required to master some of the larger museums. The \"catch\" is that because it is smaller, its capacity is also less in terms of visitors that can be accommodated at any one time so there are often long(er) lines of people waiting to get in. It is worth the wait, although depending on the time of year and the season, your patience and determination might be tested. Its best to get there early, or else visit at the end of the day. The adjacent Place du Concord offers a lot of photo opportunities (fountains, surrounding buildings, obelisk, views down the Champs Elysees to the Arch of Triumph and beyond to La Defense). A twin building to the l'Orangerie is across the park, the Jeu de Palme, which offers a different kind of art museum experience to the visitor. The museum is very visible, access is somewhat more difficult if you arrive in a vehicle, its best to walk here (weather permitting). There is a lot of parking underground in the vicinity, pay attention to where you park and which exists you use, or you may have trouble quickly finding your vehicle again."

Both are excellent museums however if you enjoyed those two, a visit to the less well known Musee de l'Orangerie should be added to your list. Get a museum passport at Musee d'Orsay that includes the Musee de l'Orangerie for 16 euros and pay for the Louve separately. The passport allows you to skip the lines in either of the two museums If those are the three museums you visit, the passport and separate admission to the Louve is still lower cost that the Museum pass. The Musee de l'Orangerie has the ground level floor dedicated to the 8 brilliant huge Monet panels, the Water Lilies (Les Nymph\u00e9as) which all play with all the variations of light in his garden at Giverny. In addition, the lower floor has many other Impressionist painting as well as painting from the Post-Impressionist period. Not a big museum but worth a visit especially if you like Monet and his water lily paintings."

There were two huge oval rooms at the rear of the upper floor specifically designed to display Manet's huge panoramic works with water-lilies and the setting was totally magical. I spent 20 minutes in there enjoying the view and enjoying the quiet, being as the majority of the noisy school parties went straight downstairs to the main area. I followed them down and was surprised by the quality of the modern art on display. The best part was the Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera temporary exhibition (there until 13th January 2014 so if you get the chance go now) which was spectacular. A nice little museum, and, especially if you have a museum pass or similar, worth the small queue outside. Being as it is so close to the Louvre, it would be a good experience directly before or after that massive undertaking. Worth it."

If you like modern art, this is a gem. We were there on a late Sunday afternoon and the line for tickets stretched to about a 2 hr wait and the exhibit was closing. People who had pre-paid tickets from online do not have to wait.

You've probably seen smaller pieces by Monet, but these are the huge panels he painted, displayed in large oval rooms designed specifically for them. You are surrounded by the garden, and it truly feels as though you are there. Although I appreciate art and enjoy museums, I'm not one to sit for long periods of time and ponder. This museum was different! I sat for a while to take in the whole experience, and then I made my way systematically around both rooms to look at the details. I was captivated. There is also an explanation (French only) of the history of the works and Monet's life in Giverny, which was enlightening. The lower level of the museum has other impressionist and post-impressionist works as well as traveling exhibits. We did not take in the Frida Kahlo exhibit due to long lines, but the other permanent collection is quite nice. L'Orangerie is small, and if you don't care for the Monet, skip it. But if you want to see Monet the way he meant it, this is a must-do."

You will find these pieces to be far more abstract than earlier works you will find in d'Orsay.Just as important as these pieces and rooms is the lower level. It is essentially a collection of the works of one person from his home. This gentleman was mentor, friend, confidant, supporter of most of the great impressionists and they rewarded his kindnesses with wonderful works of art.Also, there is an area devoted to traveling exhibits.

However, the wait was worthwhile! The addition special exhibition was excellent, but the main reason for visiting l'Orangerie is the incredible Monet murals."

Walk through the incredible Tuileries Gardens, right next to the Place de la Concorde. It is difficult to imagine the beauty of Monet's water lily painting, until you see them in person. And then, it's still difficult to imagine him painting them as he was going blind. You can see the progression of early morning to evening. If you go to the Musee before January 13th of 2014, you will get to enjoy the Frida Kahlo exhibit, too. Much more to see than Monet and Kaho - GO. Buy your tickets there or online."

You will still have to wait in a security line with a ticket, but the wait is short. Inside, security was on the ball the whole time. When parents were not watching their children and they misbehaved, security was quick to step in. In my opinion, that type of management makes the experience more enjoyable for art lovers.

To be able to paint something like this with failing eyesight is something to see, don't pass it up. That said, so many people would sit and stare and stare and fawn.

There was a Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera exhibition on at the time and although I wasn't expecting to be all that interested in either of these artists it was riveting and quite sad. I don't know why Frida bothered with him as he was quite unattractive and fat, not to mention a womaniser, even with her own sister.

With a Museum Pass, you can beat some of the crowds, but it's still a wait to get in....well worth it, however! The space is amazing and illuminates Monet's very large paintings in a beautiful way."

We got in line in a misting rain and waited about 1 and 1/2 hrs. as we had not purchased tickets earlier. There was another waiting line for those who had pre-purchased tickets or had some museum pass.They weren't too happy. Don't know how to avoid the long lines except to get there very early in the am.Security had to chase off some scammers/possible pickpockets who wanted to take a survey with clipboards so beware. We also saw another scammer who was very nicely dressed but was selling tickets while you waited (no she wasn't). Just use your good sense and get inside and see some wonderful art."

We bought a Museum Pass at the train station when we first arrived in Paris. Not only can you skip the lines (except for Notre Dame belltower) but it's easier than scrambling for cash at all the entrances. If you plan to hit the major museums and attractions, it's worth it. Anyway, I was excited to see Monet's water lilies exhibited the way the artist envisioned it to be displayed. I wasn't disappointed. When you walk into both rooms, you are overpowered by the size and the layout. The light streaming in, the stark white floors and the surrounding canvases make you actually feel as if you are in the middle of the landscape.We thought that this was all the museum had to offer. We were wrong.downstairs, we stumbled upon the most incredible collection of artwork, from the personal collection of Paul Guillaume. He was a friend to many artists before they became famous for their works and as a dealer he amassed a personal collection that is astonishing. The fact that these works once hung in his home blows me away.If you want to see the Renoir painting instantly recognizable whose image is mass reproduced all over the world, go to the Orsay. If you want to see the alternate version of that same painting by Renoir, since he painted multiple different versions, go to the Orangerie.The audio guide is worth the money as it gives you not only background on each painting but clips from the painters themselves describing what you are seeing. So many masters hung side by side in such a small space in comparison to the Louvre. Thought we were hopping in for a half hour and after nearly 2 hours, we didn't want to leave."

I was with my 10 year old daughter and out of the blue an employee came and spoke to us in french (not very polite) and I understood NOTHING. She gestured that I should follow and it turned out that she was actually being polite and saved us from the at least 1 hour line and send us straight into the museum. I assume it was becuase I had a child with me and must admit we hardly saw others in the museum. But what a nice surprise. However I noticed that people who had preordered their tickets on the internet were in the same line as people without a ticket! The Monets paintings were absolutely stunning. and the exhibition with Kahlo and Rivera was really neat. Not a hole lot of Frida Kahlo paintings but very much about their life and marriage. When we left around 11 AM the line was even longer. "

One is immersed in color and feels like a part of the scene. We have toured Monet's Garden in Giverny and were visually transported there by these paintings. The same feelings of calm and connection with nature were around us. We were fortunate one of our friends suggested this gallery as it is not as familiar as some in Paris.

It is a delightful and not large museum. The best part is clearly the two Monet rooms - that is to say two rooms that are nothing but two 360 degree paintings of Monet's gardens in Giverny. They are a a stunning display of his painting prowess. The two paintings are not just excellent, they can stir feelings that are hard to forget. The paintings were done for these rooms. Particularly if they are not crowded and can therefore give a peaceful opportunity to sit and view them, they are wonderful.The other unusual aspect of this gallery is the way in which an intense series of paintings by the same artist can be shown at the same time. This time the Renoir, Pissarro and Cezanne displays were very powerful. The Cezanne showing was better than I have seen in a number of Provence galleries. A couple of the featured artists this time were dark and somewhat disturbing compared to my prior visits. In addition, although I have been there three times, you have to recognise that the paintings on view change and you can miss some fantastic examples particularly of Impressionist art if they are on loan to other galleries."

I say \"small\" only because compared to the Louvre or the Orsay this place is tiny. Monet could be considered the founding father of impressionist painting and, indeed, the water lilies are thought by many to be his crowning master piece. Aside from the size of this work if could be considered an exercise in nuance and subtlety. It is a sumptuous experience to sit on one of the two large benches in the center of either of the large oval rooms that house these works and meditate on this elegant painting. Downstairs are a number of rooms that house works by a variety of impressionist painters. One room contained a number of works by Soutine, an artist who I knew little about. To come away from a museum excited about an artist who has had little exposure in the other museums I have visited made this a significant experience. I prefer museums that provide an intimate experience and this one fell in that category. It lived up to its billing."

But, of course, Monet's water lily paintings (10' high by 60' wide) are the stars of the show and MUST be seen in person to be appreciated.If you're deep into art appreciation, you can't leave Paris without seeing the water lilies--the calming, peaceful feeling will stay with you for a long time. Conversely, if you're traveling with someone who can't stand museums, I promise they won't mind visiting the Orangerie. There's something for everyone, but not too much of it!"

If you have the chance, and are so inclined definitely visit to see Fredas work as they are unusual and special, especially if you appreciate the works for people like Dali and the like. Unless you are a specific Monet fan and must see Les Nympheas I really would not take the time, go to Musee Rodin or one of the other smaller attractions and feel like you achieved something to remember.

The museum also contains works by Paul C\u00e9zanne, Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri Rousseau, Alfred Sisley, Chaim Soutine, and Maurice Utrillo, among others. The museum wasn't crowded when I went."

The major-league Impressionists are well-represented, and Monet's work stands out - several water-lily paintings, a haystack or two? An excellent hour was spent here."

They are housed in two rooms on the top floor of the museam - the museum was redone at some point to put these huge paintings in natural light. Downstairs is a very good impressionist collection, but the primary draw are the water lilly p[aintings. You can do the museum in under an hour if you ae rushed, focusing on the top floor, but I suggest 1 to 2 hours. A museum pass is essential, becuase the line can be very long - museum pass holders skip the line. Ir works well with children because it can be done quickly and the water lillies are so colorful and massive that they are of interest to children - at least for some limited amount of time. I cannot imagine visiting Paris without a stop at the Musee de l'Orangerie."

So the Musee de l'Orangerie was a lovely surprise when we visited (covered under the Paris Museum Pass). It's a smaller museum, so it's easy to navigate and the works are captivating, naturally beginning with Monet's Water Lilies. I had no idea how large these pieces were, so walking into the rooms where they lived was an experience. We opted for the guided audio tour, which I highly recommend to get the most out of your visit. Hearing about the Guillaume collection was so very interesting, especially Madame Guillaume's commitment to continuing her husband's art collection after his death. We visited on a weekday and arrived as the doors opened that day, which is best if you're trying to avoid the crowd, especially if you'd like to sit on the benches in the Water Lilies room to \"soak it all in.\" Overall, this a museum that I'd recommend to anyone visiting Paris--and don't forget your camera to capture the view of the Eiffel Tower and Place de la Concorde before you head to the Tuileries."

Inside, you're at leisure to spend as long as you want in front of Monet's room-sized paintings. Further to this, there's more art work to enjoy downstairs and it's quite spacious with no crowds so pushing a pram and walking with little people was pleasant.

The building is modern with clean lines and open spaces. Monet's giant water lilies, housed in two rooms specially designed (by Monet) for the purpose of relaxation and tranquility, are magnificent. While this is what l'Orangerie is mostly associated with, do not underestimate the rest of the modern art collection, which is simply excellent.

His canvases grace the curved walls of two rooms. After you discover the masterpieces, wander downstairs to find see the permanent collection or an exhibition which might be on display. Again, you can make your visit last 30 minutes or two hours, the choice is yours. It's also part of the Musee Pass, which means you can zip past all the lines! The lines are short and move fast.

Musee de l'Orangerie was the perfect solution for us. It has all the masters you could want: Picasso, Monet, Renoir, Modigliani, Cezanne, etc, plus awesome lesser knowns like Maurice Utrillo and Andre Derain. Very impressive stuff. And not so big you get lost or bored. Just big enough to keep your interest for a little over an hour, then you're done. Also not crowded. Lineup only took about 15 minutes to get through. There was a fat bearded guy making out with his girlfriend as we were trying to enjoy Monet's Waterlilies, but other than that we have no complaints. Highly recommend this museum.

I had to get up and move on to get him to leave. When my husband came back with the sandwiches, we were approached two more times with the same scam. Were they going to team up once we were distracted or demand money after we'd taken the ring? Don't know but Paris has a real problem we are noticing that we didn't experience twenty years ago.

However, this Musee turns to be truly exceptional in that its clever use of daylight has widened any layman's horizon of art appreciation. I visited on a day when Paris was mostly sunny, with a few clouds. At the oval hall, I witnessed the change of colour of the paintings, hence impression, due to the change of light (when the clouds overcast). Excuse my ignorance that's perhaps why this is Impressionist.Strongly recommended - if you have had enough of d'Orsay and Louvre (and their associated crowds)."

In addition the Walter Guillaume collection also has paintings by Matisse, Picasso and other artists from 1870 to 1930. You won't be sorry visiting this special place designed by Monet himself."

If all you want to do is take a quick look, you can be in and out in under 15 minute. But you can easily spend an hour in the room taking in the beauty of the two huge murals, on opposite walls. The museum is rarely crowded (from my experience at least) and is a wonderful peaceful setting to sit and take in the art. Of course, then you have to take a day trip (at least) to Giverny to see the actual water lilies in the pond in Monet's back yard. A warning, though: if you don't really like Monet and his water lilies paintings, skip this place. You'll be doing both yourself and those who are want to see it a favor."

My daughter (age 17) and I recently spent a week in Paris, and on our last day, we were pretty tired after all our activities (jet-lag, a day at Versailles, another day at Fountainbleu, half a day at the Marche aux Puces (Flea Market), the Latin Quarter & Notre Dame, the Rodin Museum, etc) that we decided to take it easy and go here. It was easy to access via the Metro and a short walk from the Louvre, or a longer walk from the Arc de Triomphe. It's a very manageable museum, meaning that you can see EVERYTHING in an hour or two (unlike the Louvre, where you could spend your whole life and not see everything!). The \"piece de resistance\" is, of course, the top floor, where 8 long panels of Monet's paintings cover the walls (2 separate rooms, 4 panels per room). We tried to pick our favorite panel (The Two Willows, Clear Morning with Willows, Morning w/Weeping Willows, Reflections of Trees, Green Reflections, Morning, Clouds, & Sunset), but it was impossible. Downstairs was more art, by Renoir, Cezanne, Rousseau, Modigliani, Laurencin, Matisse, Picasso, Derain, Utrillo, & Guillaume. We appreciated seeing it all, and also realized that, masterpieces that they may be, we don't necessarily LIKE all of them, which is just fine! Afterwards, we had lunch at one of the outdoor cafes in Les Tuileries, then fed the pigeons w/left-over baguettes from the previous day, and walked along the Seine. Beautiful Day!"

It gives you fast tracked access.The overall gallery is not that large but it holds a very well curated collection in several rooms downstairs. The main attraction of course are the two rooms that contain Monet's largest compositions of waterlillies. To see them in person is really a moving experience - I highly recommend making time to simply stand in the rooms and slowly absorb the sheer scale of this masterpiece.

I missed out on visiting the past few years and it was first on my list this visit.I arrived around 10.30 on Friday morning and walked right in. No queues. It was air conditioned inside, which was very welcoming given it was 30c outside. It wasn't very crowded and you had plenty of room to see everything.Oh those water lilies. Walking in and seeing these murals stopped me in my tracks. Unbelievable!! Then to see the other four was equally as amazing. I sat on the bench for a while just staring. It was quiet and you were able to take it all in.You must go downstairs to see the gallery of paintings. I was pleasantly surprised. Plenty of Picasso. The gift shop is quite lovely with some tat but also some good quality gifts/souvenirs.Lovely and not overpowering or overcrowded like the Louvre. A definite must see."

First, young kids get in for free (I'm not sure what the age limit is, but they did not charge a ticket for either of our kids).This museum has the huge and stunning Monet paintings spanning two very large rooms. The idea is to sit in the middle of the room and take it all in by turning your head (and body) to get the feeling of being inside the environment that Monet was painting.We also caught a small movie on Monet and the circumstances in which he painted the items described above. The movie is included in the price of admission and is well worth catching.Downstairs are another set of magnificent paintings by varied artists including Modigliani, Rousseau, Matisse, Picasso, and many others.Though we had young kids, they were enthralled [no complaints, lots of questions, general good humor] for about 90 minutes. It was well worth it. Afterwards, we took a walk in the Jardin d'Tuileries - the museum is located within the garden. We found a boulangerie after a 10 minute walk and got some delicious sandwiches and drinks for an on the spot picnic. If you go in the summer, they may have the \"Fete d'Tuileries\" which is a temporarily built amusement park for kids with all kinds of rides. We went there after lunch and a good time was had by all.Highly recommended."

Those amazing, panoramic Monet waterlily paintings that were at the Marmotin for many years are back at the Orangerie and are as awe-inspiring as ever, perfectly lit and not too busy. You can't take photos of them but you can of the interesting collection of paintings downstairs. We thought this our best museum visit in Paris - a compact but stunning collection of paintings."

If this is included on your museum pass I'd suggest you stop for 20 minutes of Monet. For our family of 4 it was a very expensive half hour. If you pay for entrance, plan for time in the lower level which has some surprisingly good collections. Better yet, save your time, money, and museum energy for the Musee d'Orsay across the river which is much bigger and thorough in quality."

Take a seat in this Monet filled treasure, relax and soak in the two giant rooms surrounded by his two water Lily masterpieces. The walls are curved into ovals as the themes envelope you with their calming, yet sometimes troubling, mood. Walk around the room looking both at the close ups of paint splotches that should not work, but when you walk away become perfect flowers or trees. Look at them from afar as you circle the rooms and they change with perspective. The test of the museum has a nice collection but you go and stay for the lilies."

There are several galleries of wonderful paintings, but the reason to come here is to see the gigantic Monets. Two impressive oval rooms are wall-to-wall Monet lily ponds. The pieces depict the same scene at different times of day, and during different seasons. Breathtaking! Thankfully, the rooms are large enough to accommodate the people without obstructing one's view. This is a must see for anyone who appreciates Monet!"

The museum is set in the Tuileries Garden, along the Seine River. It is in the old Orangerie of the park, but the interior of the museum is modern and minimalist which allows the impressionist pieces to speak without interuption.The museum has a perfect amount of paintings: split into two levels, the bottom floor has a comfortable number of impressionist pieces from several artists. The volume of paintings allows you to easily visit and absorb each piece at a reasonable pace. The second floor (the floor you enter l'Orangerie on) is dedicated to Monet's waterlilies in (2) oval studios - just as he intended them to be viewed. The oval rooms are a pure creamy white, which allows the enormous paintings to encompass you entirely, without interruption or distraction. The crowds are extremely manageable (museum closed on Tuesdays), the volume of pieces allows you to view every piece, and the progression from bottom to top is perfectly moderated. Highly recommended."

I've seen them in art books but had no idea the paintings were so large. It would have been nice to sit down and take them in, but too many people were using the seats in each gallery as a rest stop. There's a lot more to see downstairs. I particularly liked the Soutine paintings. I was not familiar with this artist before visiting, but I was impressed with the work. It's not a big museum, you can easily have a decent visit in 1-1.5 hours. If you have a Paris Museum Pass you can get right in. If not, you may wait outside. I visited around Noon on a Monday and waited about 30 minutes to purchase a ticket."

This fabulous edifice is a Tuileries garden gem,with an outstanding collection of art,especially Monet's exquisite 'Nympheas'. The experience is both monumental and intimate,housing the mighty eight murals in which water-lilies float on the canvas. Monet's prized water lilies which he conceived for this former palace greenhouse,wrap around two skylit oval rooms,under direct diffused light. Absolute magic!! the collection exhibits impressionism and classisism in the subterranean section housing the magic formulae of Cezanne,Mattise,Rousseau,as well as, Picasso,Utrillo,Soutine and Derain. As much as this is a delight for first-timers,the l'Orangerie is addictive for repeat offenders.. The gallerie's appeal lies in part, to its pleasing sense of scale and when not crowded,to its calming and exciting effect. Mull the experience further as you amble through your garden walk."

The Walter-Guillaume collection of the Orangerie includes much more than works of Monet. We equally enjoyed the many works by all the great Impressionists...Renoir, Sisley, Utrillo, Matisse, etc. The Derains, Picassos and Soutines were also favorites of Paul Guillaume who collected these astonishishing works before their time.The Paris Museum Pass gets you in through a much shorter lineup."

            "review": "Relax with Monet. Musee de l'Orangerie is best known for its two room-sized paintings in Monet's garden series. He donated these mural-like paintings to the city of Paris after WWI, so that the citizens could take a break from the stress of their working lives and refresh with a \"virtual visit\" (no, he didn't use those words, but that's what he meant) to his beloved Givenchy gardens. Some may quibble at the admissions price, but if you are a fan of Monet, or just in need of some peace, it is more than worth it. There are other galleries here, which included an excellent exhibition of Italian impressionists when I was there, but really, Monet is the draw. Do yourself a favor and settle down on one of the benches in the \"garden\" rooms and open yourself to the essence of the Givenchy gardens, which these paintings convey more effectively than you can imagine."

It exists primarily because of the work of Monet.While many might revile Monet and his peers for producing consumable, safe art that people actually found pleasing, the l'Orangerie is truly a testimony to the actual depth and breadth of the Impressionists and their heirs. Yes, the waterlillies are pretty to look at, and you can see versions of them around the world, but when you see the eight giant canvases displayed in a space designed for them, in a space where you can appreciate not only the sweeping scale and beauty of these masterpieces but the intricate detail of both the art and the artist, only in this place have I found myself truly \"getting it.\" If nothing else, to imagine what it took for an aging artist to create these while suffering near-debilitating cataracts, and indeed undergoing the pain of surgery to improve his sight to finish these works, belies that this was not (as some would decry it) safe art for the masses. Monet had a vision, and no place I've seen captures it as perfectly as l'Orangerie.The added bonus is the lower level. While d'Orsay presented a world-class set of selections from the Montmartre crowd, l'Orangerie places these next to (well, below) Monet's great works in a manner that greatly illumines the complexity of the whole Impressionist (and post-Impressionist) movement in Paris and environs. Go. Please."

I sat on the centre oval seat, shoulder to shoulder of course. I dunno much about art so I didn't stay as long as others. The story behind why Mr Monet did this is interesting.I could have spent hours in the downstairs gallery - there must be hundreds of paintings, with Cezanne Renoir Modigliani and lots of other guys. Fascinating. They could do with some more seating, because I found many of these just entrancing, they just call out to you :Hey, take a closer look, come and enjoy this one too\".If I am ever in Paris again even for one day, I will go back to Musee d l'Orangerie. On this trip we resisted the temptation of buying a book about every attraction, but I bought this one.Unfortunately, the more time you spend in there, the less time you have for Place de la Concorde just outside (that is where my taxi dropped me off), or for the picnic or stroll through Jardin Tuileries (I strolled on back through the gardens, through the fantastic Louvre courtyards, back to our aprtment by Pont Neuf).A great afternoon in Paris."

People who love impressionist painting know that there is more and better impressionist work in this museum than in any other museum in the world.You can go to most museums of quality in large cities around the world and see a certain amount of Impressionist work but there is no place to see the quantity and quality that you can see here.The only suggestion to be made is that you try to go to time when it will not be filled with schoolchildren or tourists. This would suggest around opening time and certainly in times of the year such as the late fall, winter or early spring when then maybe fewer tourists around. If you can manage this you'll be able to wander through the museum without having to struggle to see all of the paintings.If this is not possible it is worth going anyway as we did because what is there not be found anyplace else."

The vast canvas painting of his impressions of his waterlily gardens is something to see. The canvas of them takes up the expanse of 2 large sunlit galleries. The paintings curve around the gallery itself and seem to engulf you on center- not the same as experiencing them live- but pretty darn close! The only minus really is the policy of most of the museum entrances to have only one line and one cashier for entrances which if you do not arrive early will take up a bit of time. The location is at the end of the museum plaza , if you have a problem locating it up on a hill- there is an information kiosk directly below . Just ask there and the guards will direct you. This is located in a beautiful garden area- combine the two on a beautiful day!"

These include his famous Water Lilies murals, which are displayed in a sympathetically designed separate gallery which includes carefully positioned seating and this allows these extensive works to be viewed at length in comfort.

Monet planned this place to install his last monumental murals of his water lilies; and downstairs there is the fine Paul Guillaume collection of post-impressionist paintings - Rousseau, Cezanne, Picasso, Matisse, and many others There are a few imposing Rodin sculptures outside the museum - but the major setting attraction is its location in the Tuileries Gardens, worth a visit by themselves. This is the 300th anniversary of the birth of the landscape architect Andre LeNotre, who planned this garden for Louis XIV, and the flower display is just lovely. Sit here for a while and watch Parisians having fun - and don't miss having ice cream from the \"petal cone\" cart - there are a couple dozen exotic and exquisite flavors, and you decide what size cone you want and what flavors you want them to add as the \"petals\" - YUM! Why don't we have one of these in Central Park? - they'd make a mint, and I'd go there all the time!"

What is great about this museum & what worked for us:1. It has the most magnificent art display: Monet's wall to wall water lilies. Scale of the display is just stunning. It runs from one room to another & is unlike any other art you would have experienced. The water lilies are a reason enough to visit this museum.2. Relatively small museum limited to Monet & impressionists(downstairs). It doesn't overwhelm, much lesser crowd factor.3.

I did not see a taxi rank nearby.At the Orangerie you can buy a combination ticket which include priority entry to the Musee d'Orsay within four days. This is probably the easiest and least expensive way to buy a priority ticket for the Orsay.If you need to ask directions, the museum is pronounced \"orange-rie\" with the accent on the last syllable."

They are beautiful and worth the time to enjoy. But please don't miss the exhibits on the lower level of Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, Modigliano, Picasso and others. If you have the time we highly recommend this museum either before or after strolling the Tuileries."

Once settled, with one's mind cleared, one is only aware of being surrounded by the garden of Monet throughout the seasons of the year. On a warm day in Spring it was an absolute gift to sit and be serene, then walk through the Tuileries to the Carousel below the Louvre and stroll through the shops. Wonderful Paris. It has many secrets but we are slowly uncovering some previously unknown pleasures."

But for those of you that don't prepare yourself to fall in love with an art movement that shaped Parisian cultural during the late 19th & early 20th centuries. Come to this intimate & relatively un-crowded museum (you can easily budget just a couple of hours here) for Monet's Les Nympheas but stay for the art collection of a 1920's art dealer, Paul Guillaume, that resides here. It is amazing and includes important works from Monet, Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso, Renoir & others. View up close and then slowly move farther & farther back - the paintings are genius. Until July 22 of 2013 the museum has a large borrowed collection of Italian Impressionists \"The Macchiaioli\". While very different in style from the French, gorgeous works of art that depict impressions of life. I highly recommend the audio guide as the history of the movement & the artists will give you a new perspective. Not a huge museum so it won't day you hours & hours to navigate. If you are also going to the d'Orsay you can buy a combo pass (only good for 4 days I think) for the 2 museums and save a little money."

Second, the Musee has a fine and manageable exhibit sampling the history of Impressionism from Renoir forward. Even your non-aficianado friend will not get painting-viewing fatigue.

It is a much smaller museum and so had a much more focused collection. Waterlillies was, of course, breathtaking, but many of the works downstairs were also quite famous and gorgeous. Also, this museum allowed photos (without flash) in most of its galleries (no photos of Waterlillies though)."

A great feeling of happiness and calm - it puts my world back in balance.The Marie Laurencin room, with 5 paintings was lovely.Amedeo Modigliani was interesting (visited his grave this week at Pere-lachaise cemetery).I never used to 'get' Henri Rousseau and after looking at a further handful of his paintings I still don't!.The 'Classical' section of paintings by Picasso and Matisse were interesting although a couple of paintings for each were away on touring exhibitions. The two Monet Waterlillies Oval rooms were very crowded, which did detract somewhat, however they are still very special.Allow a couple of hours to visit to enjoy the paintings to their full extent."

True, we should have pre-booked tickets and learned a lesson as countless coach parties were herded in ahead of us. Nevertheless the existence of only two booking desks has to be challenged and there was a definite sense that the external security staff were doing us a good turn by allowing us access. There must be a better way of treating guests especially given that many [including ourselves] were plainly of advancing years and suffering in the conditions. I recognise that there would be a reluctance to overcrowd the gallery but on this occasion common-sense via some management leadership would have been in order."

I had always planned to visit the Musee to pay homage to some of my favourites: Monet (of course!) Soutine, Cezanne.Renoir, Matisse and Modigliani. I found myself particularly romanced by the works by Marie Laurencin- What a pleasant surprise! I love the light and airy feel of the Musee, it is a perfect home for Water Lillies. Lovers of Monet will feel their chest squeeze with adoration when staring infront of the moving murals. What a gem, I truly love this place- And the staff are really friendly as well, added bonus!"

There you can wander through the extensive garden, have a light lunch outdoors, and a scenic train ride to and from Paris.

There are two rooms designed specifically to display Monet's water lilies. The size of the paintings are incredible and allow you to be immersed in the works.

I'm not quite sure how the crowds managed to part, but I suppose this is just a way of saying that the number of people were not a hindrance to enjoyment.Stop in even if just for a quick look, and stay longer if the spirit moves."

If you like Monet, or don't know anything about impressionist art at all, this gallery is the best way possible to experience and immerse yourself in the best of the best. Two 360 degree rooms put you in the middle of Monets water lilly filled imagination and a visit to the gallery can be as quick as 15 minutes, or as long and thoughtful as you like. This place is a treasure, don't miss it."

This is where you will find Monet's Waterlilly panels which he gifted to the French Government with the proviso that they never left France. These were painted in his garden at Giverny, at different times of day. Showing the different shades of light. The Orangerie has been renovated several times over the years. The last time was for six years and it reopened again in 2006. This gives the best possible light for the panels. It is possible to just sit in quiet contemplation on a long seat down the middle of the two oval rooms. If there are not too many people around it is possible to get \"lost into the panels\" completely. Downstairs is a collection of several Masterpieces that were donated by Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume, which are absolutely marvellous."

After bursting out in tears of happiness when I first time viewed a painting of the litlle Giverny Japanese Bridge by Claude Monet in the musee d'Orsay, After being touched by the Nymphea painting at the MoMA in N.Y. and crying of exaltation when I visited the Giverny gardens, now it was the muss de l'Orangerie's turn to make me grab my handkechief. When you know what Monet's quest was, not painting the objects (anyone can paint a pink dot and say it's an waterlilly) but trying to paint the sprakling reflections of light, capturing the moment and show on his canvas the matter in between his eye and the object, then anyone that sees this paintings will be emontionally grabbed by this work of art. Don't watch to close, just sit on the bench and let the paintings impress you'll be hooked forever. You'll notice that after seeing the four paintings in the second hall and return to the first, it seems like the first four paintings have changed, due to the fact that you perception has changed. The other works of the collection are nice but nothing can impress you after seeing the eight Monet's. Therefore I advise to see the collection in the basement first and after that as an apotheosis visit the eight Monet's.The estimated time a visit takes you is difficult to say. We've stayed over three hours. This time took us to see the Monet's twice and get the full impression to realize what an effort it took and what an achievement it was to create this paintings. If you're not so much of an art-lover and don't want to study Monet's work and life, it probably takes you less then an hour."

However no lift (acenseur) or escalator (escalier roulant) was evident and there are a lot of stairs to go down to the second gallery. By the time we had looked at Monet on the ground-level floor and seen part of the floor below, she was exhausted. I asked for the use of a wheelchair, which they had, but because I did not have photo ID with me (passport in hotel, other ID stolen in Nice), they just would not allow us to use one. I offered to leave my watch and camera as security, but no. Even though to exit we had to go right past the desk where this discussion was held. This meant we could not see the whole museum which was so disappointing. Shame on you, L`Orangerie. Otherwise I would definitely encourage a visit. Small but full of magificent art. Entry is 7.50 Euros."

But the rest of the collection of Impressionist paintings was fabulous. The size of the collection is very manageable, so you can see and enjoy it all in a couple hours. There was an excellent special exhibition as well. If you are short on time and you want to see a good Impressionist collection, go here! The line was much shorter than at d'Orsay. If you want to see both, go to de l'Orangerie first and buy a passport ticket for both museums, so you can skip the ridiculous line at d'Orsay."

Suggest you go early and spend 1/2 an hour or so in each of the two Monet rooms looking at the 4 huge paintings in each room. They change with the external light and sitting down and contemplating them is worth it. It was not very busy early. If crowded, the experience would be significantly diluted.

The first section, on the main floor, is composed of two oval rooms, the walls of which feature Monet's water garden. It's a gentle reflective space. Downstairs the collection of Impressionist Paintings is surprisingly large -- the museum seems quite small from the outside. It's well worth a visit, and gives you a nice bite-sized portion of world-class art."

They are mounted directly to the wall in an oval room with natural light. Monet actually donated the painting to the museum himself and was part of the design team that designed the room that they sit in today. I got the feeling that I was sitting in a room with not only the artists work, but the artist himself. It was a sureal feeling. I only wish I could sit in the middle of this room by myself. I think about the people that work there and envy the semi private time they may get with the paintings and I wonder if they appreciate that privledge. There are many other great impressionist artists displayed here and very much worth the trip. You can do this museum and the gardens and Rodin all in the same day. This museum is also included on the museum pass. Take it in and enjoy these paintings but you cannot take photo's of the lilies, so make sure you burn the images into you brain to recall later. There are plenty of other artists as well such as Renoir, Cezanne and my personal favorite, Matisse."

At only 7.5 euro I'd say this is worth the trip, but how much you get out of it probably depends on what you think of the giant Monet murals that make this place famous. For me, seeing them in person was nowhere near as impressive as his other (smaller) works. There are some beautiful Renoir's though on the lower level. The line is usually short or non-existant, and this is still a nice 45 minute detour while strolling through the Tulleries."

Being in proximity to such other amazing venues, Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie seems to be on the \"if we have time\" list for many visitors and that is a shame, as the main oval galleries are stunning spaces displaying Monet's Nymp\u00e9as in the manner he intended. If it was in just about any other city, it would take pride of place.SURPRISING: The paintings are apparently glued to the walls to achieve the curvature. This explains why they were not in a vault during WW2 when the Mus\u00e9e was hit by shelling. One of the canvas sports a large (well disguised) patch - keep children occupied by challenging them to spot it.ADVICE:1) The galleries downstairs are not very well signed, don't miss them.2) EU citizens 25 years old and under- You can get into the Mus\u00e9e free if you have photo ID with your age on.3) Entry is free to all on the first Sunday of each month.4) The security will let you through carrying an umbrella, but not mention you should then leave it at the cloakroom. Museum staff will escort you from the premises with much Gallic arm waiving and excitement, if you are found in the galleries with one (as my dear wife will attest)."

It told her it was ridiculous so she became angry and sent me to security. He said I had to carry the laptop because no bags are allowed in the museum. I gave up and carried my laptop around with us.

Sitting on a bench in two different galleries, surrounded by four enormous curving Waterlily canvases is truly unparalleled. For those who are overwhelmed by Musee du Louvre or even Musee d'Orsay, you will appreciate the smaller, more intimate setting of l'Orangerie. It has other works by Renoir, Picasso, Modiglian and additional masters from 1870-1930. My daughters and I had long dreamed of seeing these larger than life paintings by Monet and so it was truly a special to treat to sit surrounded by his masterpieces. Photos do not do it justice. Take a break from walking, rest your feet and enjoy the beauty in this gem of a museum just off the Tuileries gardens."

The detail on such scale is so impressive and even if you just sit on the bench and contemplate one of the more beautiful scenery paintings you are likely to see on a life size scale. We went as par of our museum pass but I think it was about 7Euro anyway - there are other exhibits and a gift shop that was very well priced with interesting items I did not even see at the Louvre - it seemed to have a lot appropriate for children.This is unlikely to take more than 2 hours of your time."

They are set, in two enormous rooms, in the round. So you sit, surrounded by all this impossible beauty, and you feel ... calm. There is a real sense of hush in the room. Even children tend to quieten down when they are there. If you have any sense of romance, or nostalgia, then Renoir's works will enchant you. Perhaps you remember his painting of two angelic looking girls sitting at the piano from your own youth. He captures a time, and a place, so beautifully. Yes, this is a Romantic Gallery, capturing that moment, that split moment in time before the world erupted into the chaos that was the early twentieth century. This gallery would transport even the hardiest of souls. That is why I keep on returning."

It was enjoyable then, but what a complete pleasure it is now!Monet's \"Nympheas\" (water lilies) now reside on the ground level, with well thought out natural light showing them off to advantage. There is plenty of room to sit and ponder or walk along right next to the paintings to see the technical details of Impressionism up close and personal. During my visit, French elementary children were sitting on the floor of one hall creating their own masterpieces with crayons, while an English-only tour was on in the second hall. There was still plenty of room to enjoy these amazing works completed by a true master at the very end of his life.The Paul Guillaume collection downstairs is also well presented, again with enough room to enjoy the many paintings by Renoir, Modigliani, Derain, Picasso, Cezanne, Utrillo and Soutine (if anyone can call looking at Soutine's work \"enjoyable\"!). A few nice Matisses, and lots of Rousseau, filled out the well-known artists represented. I was particularly taken with the work of Marie Laurencin, whose subjects included combinations of women, music and dogs (since I am a woman musician who likes dogs, this struck a chord!)There are in-house tours in English, children's programs, and audio guides, making this small gem of a museum very user friendly. It is also included on the Paris Carte Musee pass, as well as pairing up with the Musee d'Orsay for a \"two-fer\" reduction.The location of the Musee de l'Orangerie makes it great for combining with a visit to any number of other attractions/activities, from the Tuileries Gardens to Angelina Cafe for hot chocolate.

A tip to get the best effect is to stand by one of the entry/exit points and scan the room from here. If you are lucky you can sit on the central bench and get a visitor-uninterrupted panorama, for a few seconds at least.The rest of the museum is also a delight, particularly strong in Renoirs.

The last time I was in Paris quite a few years back, it hadn't opened yet in it's present form and had been top of my 'to-do' list ever since. Absolutely worth the wait! I have seen many versions of the 'Waterlilies' in numerous museums across the world, but nothing prepared me for the breathtaking sight of entire walls of them! And to think that Monet had planned the display as well, such that they are now being seen exactly where and how the painter wanted them to be.Just a small problem - all the descriptions, titles, writing everywhere, is in French only. Also a lovely little collection by Guillaume on the floor below, including Picassos, Renoirs, Cezzannes,Matisses etc."

Four paintings wrapped within the walls of each of two oval shaped chambers. These initially seemed rather bland large paintings. *However standing and viewing them from a distance I really appreciated the ethereal beauty and perspective created by Claude Monet's masterful brushstrokes. The surface of the pond appeared to reflect the clouds above whilst the water lilies floated on its surface. I have to say I felt a calm peacefulness standing in the room and could have sat there for a long time (but moved on with the family). Unfortunately there were no English brochures left and we had no ID to use an iPad interactive guide. We couldnt take photos inside either. Subsequent reading has further fascinated me as Monet painted these aged 80 when he'd experienced several losses such as his wife and son. It was just after the First World War, and his eyesight was failing because of cataracts. He painted these to capture the beauty of his lily ponds at home."

I almost fell for it going in, my husband knew right away. After leaving the museum a lady tried to pull it on me again, I kept walking and warned another tourist almost about to fall for it. The lady cursed at me and even tried to spit me (well at least from far away, i was many feet away from her)Now on to the museum. The museum is great. The Nymphs exhibition is excellently arranged. You can really tell that Monet really studied and planned this murals for a long time. The exhibition is even cardinal direction accurate (eg, the sunset mural is placed on the west). It's incredible to think how Monet maintained the scale and the visual effect for the observer while still working on an impressionist piece. The curvatures make the effect complete. The rest of the museum contain great impressionist pieces from a Parisian collector. There are early Picasso's, Renoirs, and Modiglianis."

This will not only save money, it also permits access through special permit points in various museums to save waiting in line. We found this particularly helpful at the Louvre and Versailles. That being said, one of the pleasure of this museum was the lack of crowds and relative calm.As others have noted, the Monet Water Lilies are not to be missed. There are two rooms containing these works, and the eye level positioning allows a unique perspective when viewing. The day following our visit, we traveled out to Giverny to see the actual subject of these masterpieces. I'd highly recommend such an itinerary if your time permits."

The waterlillies are absolutely stunning in this setting and it would be worth the visit for them alone. However, it was the Paul Gulliame collection which was really superb - the use of the space means the paintings can be seen at very close quarters and in exceptionally good light. What is particularly good about the exhibition is the flow of the works and how this supports the viewer to really understand and recognise the relationship between the various artists and the evolution of the styles presented.

You aren't supposed to take pictures of these, and they are nice, but I feel like it's not nearly enough to be the entirety of one half of the museum, and I love impressionists and Monet in general. The second (lower) floor had more to it, and I rather liked it. There were a few works by Picasso, some Renoirs, etc and while also rather small, was still quite nice.

There is a row of benches in the middle of the room and my husband and I could have just sat for hours staring at the stunning paintings.

In this case the setting is part of the work, and you have no idea what these pictures are like until you are sitting in the middle of them, almost immersed in fact. While you are at that end of the Tuileries, the Tuileries bookshop might repay a visit - books about horticulture and historic gardens in several languages, as well as other bits and pieces."

However, not being \"artsy people\", we didn't really take to the rest of the more modern and new age paintings in the gallery so we thought 8 Euros each was a bit steep -although we did spend a long time looking at the Water Lillies."

Part of the Paris Museum Pass (highly recommended as you can the skip the lines) - it was pretty amazing to see Monet's paintings in person and to realize how large they were and to think about the process of creating each one. This museum showcases the personal holdings of one art collector - interesting to learn about him and his passion for Impressionist painting. Personally I think it's great that cameras are not allowed. Experience and appreciate the art. If you want a picture of a particular piece then by a postcard in the gift shop."

We had a Paris museum pass, so we technically already had our tickets, but he wouldn't let me take a quick peek. I begged and he still said no. It was really a shame, I was dying to see the water lilies. Luckily I've seen some at MoMA, but I am sure this would have been even more breathtaking. The guy standing at the door said \"Maybe next time...\" but of course I'm an American that doesn't get to Paris often.

We had spent the morning in the Musee Marmottan so the Orangerie was just to be a whistle stop. Two hours later we were still in the first room. Once you figure out elements of the style, composition and technique you begin to discover new facets of the paintings.What can I say about this place, it holds a fascination for us beyond the artwork. The atmosphere, the design, the space...There are great restrooms, lifts but no refreshments. The shop is simply amazing and you can seriously hurt your wallet if you stay too long. Look for the photographic documentation along the entry walkway. But most importantly, dont plan to leave after just a brief glance. Walk back and forth, stand close, stand far away, sit a while. Breath slowly and relax. I cant wait for the third visit to my second most favorite gallery.By the way, there are some other paintings in the building, but who cares, this is a monument to one man."

We had heard of it in advance so we knew what to expect. This didn't really prepare us, though, for the stunning size and beauty of Monet's Water Lilly panels and the classy way in which the paintings have been presented in the two rooms. It wasn't busy when we visited (in contrast to the Louvre which we had just left) and the viewing benefited from this. The serenity and beauty were uplifting. A visit downstairs to view the Renoirs which were part of the Paul Guillaume collection was an added bonus. Do take the time to visit l'Orangerie in the Tuilereries Gardens. You won't be disappointed. Obtaining a Museum Pass in advance will get you in without having to queue."

The museum is a very agreeable addition to a visit to the D'orsay, as they are almost opposite each other on the Seine. Although you may at first not think that you saw much, I can almost guarantee that some of the paintings from the lower level(Guillaume collection) will imprint themselves in your mind forever (Soutine, for me), let alone just the thought of Monet painting those mammoth water lilies.To avoid long line ups, try to buy a two day pass at a lesser attraction in Paris. We stay close to the Cluny, which seems to never have a line up. Buy your tickets at a similar place if you can, that way you can avoid the long line of ticket buyers at the big attractions.After your visit to both of these museums head into the Jardins de Tuileres for a glass of wine and a look at Paris at rest."

I am a fan of Monet and other than Mus\u00e9e Marmontann, L'Orangerie has the best display. Then you start adding the Renoir's and Picasso's and Matisse and....well, you get the idea. A must visit if you are in town."

The paintings are displayed in two large oval rooms - the paintings curve around the walls and are just mesmerizing! What a treat to be able to visit this beautiful, museum to see these paintings so exquisitely displayed. Do not miss this if you have any opportunity at all to go! We visited it after having enjoyed the very fine impressionist exhibit at the D'Orsay where a few of Monet's smaller waterlily paintings are exhibited and where we learned a good deal about these paintings and Monet's great fondness for them. Stroll through the tuilleries gardens after your visit and think about the magic of Monet's waterlily paintings and the wonderful L'Orangerie!"

The waterlillies have the expected wow factor, but you can easily spend a few hours in the gallery below. I recommend paying the 4 or 5 euros for the audio guide. I have never done that before in a gallery and felt it really added to the experience. You can pick and choose which paintings you want to hear more about, and there is an accessible version aimed at children. I watched one little boy of about 6 who seemed fascinated by the whole thing! Magical way to spend a rainy afternoon."

Im not a huge art fan and still loved it so for an art lover or monet fan, I imagine it must be even more spectacular! Be warned though- no talking allowed in the room where the canvasses are. The gallery staff are very strict on this!"

I thought I had seen enough Monet water lillies in one lifetime before I saw them in these special rooms with natural light. It was storming outside, and the paintings came alive: the water seemed to be moving. A wonderful Chaim Soutine show was there too. Rich permanent collection. Wonderful."

There was also a temporary exhibit but we did not visit. This museum is relatively small (tiny compared to the Louvre). But the size makes the experience very enjoyable (not as overwhelming as visiting the Louvre, for example).Right outside the Musee d'Orsay, there is a small garden with large, life-size Rodin statutes.

In the lower level is the collection of Paul Guillaume, the most important art dealer in Paris during the early 20th century. Picasso's blue period and rose period are represented by important works. Renoirs line the walls, paintings that are so famous that you surely saw reproductions in your grand parents house. Cezanne, Matisse, Gauguin, Rousseau and others are represented. During our visit a comprehensive exhibit of paintings by Soutine was on display. Next year Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera paintings will be exhibited. Musee de l'Orangerie is a world class museum of art and it should be included in any visit to Paris lasting more than three days."

Went straight to Monet's piece and it was everything I hoped it would be: grand, inspiring, peaceful. Went downstairs to see the rotating collection and a Soutine exhibit, which was quite nice and a good juxtaposition in comparison to Monet and the other pieces on display at the time. Best of all, it's a small museum, so it is not a huge time commitment or extensive entree of art, for those who would like to see other sites in Paris or, like my companions, those with a short attention span.

If you like Monet, there is no other place to go but L'Orangerie!I remember a few years ago, I visited Musee Marmottan and saw his famous Nympheas. The space was tight and they had to show the individual panels separately. I was thinking, are you kidding me? I can't believe these made Monet famous.Well, a few years later l'Orangerie reopened after the renovation and I visited it to see his Nympheas. I was totally taken by it. They were so mesmerizing!!! Especially, after you read the story behind how Monet was going blind when he painted them! Thereafter, every time I visited Paris, I will definitely visit l'Orangerie even I skipped the Louve or musee d'Orsay. I took some pictures a few years ago, but unfortunately, this time they won't allow any photographing at all! Here are some pictures I told a few years ago."

Definitely worth a stop if you are using a Museum Pass."

Well, since then the great renovation has taken place! What a beautiful gallery! So much space, so clean and light, and the art so well displayed! And what a relief not to have to crane one's neck as one does in so many galleries around the world, where pictures are hung one above the other instead of only at eye-level. It's amazing how just one painting can take one's breath away; a Gauguin did that for me - painted just 2 years before he died - a man and two children in a field, two bright green trees, nothing special you might say but it blew me away.And then the principal exhibit, those two connecting elliptical rooms with the most amazing Monet lilies. Having visited Giverny all those years ago, my wife and I enjoyed both the 8 panels of the painting and the flood of memories which they evoked. This is surely, in a city that houses so many great and beautiful works of art, a national treasure, so it is great to learn that it survived the wartime bombings and the (to us incomprehensible) years of dismissive neglect."

The collection at L'Orangerie is not as extensive as that in several other Parisian museums, but I particularly like the curating, especially of the special exhibits. The order in which the paintings are exhibited and the written information provided with the exhibits truly lead to better understanding of the artist and her/his works. Fair warning: although brochures for the special exhibits are available in English, additional information throughout the exhibits is in French only.As for the Monet murals, if a viewer sits quietly, s/he can, in a sense, become immersed in Monet's garden rather than being a mere observer of paintings. This works better when the museum isn't crowded, i.e. very early in the morning or just before closing. If you have a museum pass, insist that the guards show you the correct line. It is much shorter than the line for purchasing tickets."

The Monet Waterlillies are here, but downstairs there are many wonderful Renoirs & special guest exhibitions.The Monet waterlillies, seen as the artist intended, two rooms were all walls are covered in large mural sized panels, to create a chill spot away from the bustle and problems of life, for war torn Parisians, equally in need in today's modern stressful environment .There are so many Renoirs, and Picasso's spanning the early and late careers of these artist, you can see the evolution of their style. Never seen a non-cubic painting by Picasso, let alone one as he is developing the style he was famous for.Big surprise, well worth the vist."

My wife and I just happened to end up at this end of the Tuileries Gardens with some extra time on our hands and decided to pop if for a look-see. Since we had previously purchased the Paris Museum Pass, we had no entrance cost.I give this Museum a mid-rating. There is some good art but, in my opinion, it doesn't deserve more than a 30 minute stay. The central piece of art is certainly the Monet Water-Lilies panels displayed in the basement in oval rooms. There are other pieces of Impressionist art that appealed to us but there's not enough to spend a great deal of time viewing. If you are really interesed in seeing a comprehensive collection of Monet Art and a representation of Impressionart art from Monet's contemporaries, I strongly suggest a visit to the Marmottan Museum in the 16th arrondisement. A few stops on the Metro land you a short walk to this Museum. It's well worth the effort to get there and is worthy of a few hours taking in all this magnificent art. If you love Monet, don't pass on the Marmottan."

We came here right after visiting Monet's house and gardens in Giverny (thus seeing the famed water-lily pond scene first, and the famous set of paintings, called the Nympheas, of that pond second). Combining these in the same day enhanced our appreciation of both. Monet's house is interesting for its historical significance in Impressionist art, while the panoramic paintings in the Orangerie have a calming quality, a sense of the infinite, that go well beyond real life. For us, then, the visit to Giverny was more of an intellectual exercise, while sitting in the Orangerie to soak in the Nympheas was more of an emotional, even a spiritual experience. Whether or not you have the time to go to Giverny, and even if you know nothing about Art, invest the brief time it takes to visit the Orangerie. One week after their visit to Paris, few non-artsy people will be able to remember a single particular painting in the more famous Musee d'Orsay. But no one will ever forget Monet's water-lilies."

The displays and the audio tour were quite good and you obtained an understanding of the background and the progression of the artists as they matured over the years.

Yes, there is the room where you are surrounded by Monet's waterlilies which filled us with awe but there is not much more.This should be Monet's 'shrine' so where were all the works - on loan? We didn't see many vacant spots where normally there is a note saying that the painting is on loan.However, it is still well worth the visit although the entrance fee seems high.

Somehow overlooked by tourist crowds and overshadowed by a more imposing and definitely more well-known Orsay, Musee de l'Orangerie offers an amazing and extensive collection of the cult art dealer and art collector Paul Guillaume, the collection successfully continued after the death of the latter by Guillaume's wife's new husband, the architect Jean Walter. In our opinion Orangerie is undoubtedly a more attractive and interesting destination that the Marmottan museum, let alone boasting a more central location compared to the Marmottan (Orangerie is located by the western exit of the Tuileries gardens overlooking the Place de la Concorde). The spherical halls of Claude Monet's Lillies are impressive, but the various variants of the same theme are widely represented in many world museums. This is not the case with the unique works by Modigliani, Rousseau, Soutine, Utrillo, Gauguin, Sisley, C\u00e9zanne, Marie Laurencin, Derain, Matisse, Picasso, Renoir, and Van Dongen. There museum also features a comprehensive exhibition dedicated to Paul Guillaume, his collection, his Paris addresses, the controversy surrounding his wife Domenica, etc. One can purchase the tickets on-line well in advance (we did), which offers an increased convenience when planning your visit."

The eight murals each convey a different impression or season or time of day.

We felt it would be easier to manage in our jet lagged state than some of the larger museums, and were very happy with our decision. With both its location at the edge of the Tuilleries, and content, it was an immersion back into Paris life after an absence of several years. It was our first time to see this museum, as it had been closed previously for renovation during our visits. The stars of course are Monet's two rooms of huge water lily panels. You can just sit and enjoy from room to room then back again. This museum lacks some of the frantic crowds which can detract from other museums. The panels of course are magnificent. I witnessed one woman burst into tears upon walking into the room. The museum is a delight, low key, and as we thought, a perfect first day visit for jet lagged souls!"

This museum is very French language focused so ticketing, etc., is not the easiest for those who do not know French well - Prepare to be patient. Fortunately, the beauty of the paintings explode beyound language. This is not a large museum - The first floor contains two rooms of Monet's water lilies, and the basement/lower floor has a wing for special exhibits and another for a permanent collect of Impressionist era art. The size does not diminish the power of the works included, it just means (unlike the larger Parisian museums) a visit can easily be completed in 1 to 3 hours depending on one's level of art interest. Plus the location is city central, just across from the Place Concorde and Egyption Obelisk. Words cannot convey the depth of beauty painted by Monet in these water lily paintings - Each different but equally mesmerizing. Truely moving."

I have always wanted to go to the Orangerie but until my last trip to Paris was never able, mostly due to the lengthy period it was closed for renovation. It was worth the wait and so much more than I expected. Quite honestly I went to see the Waterlillies, which are awe inspiring to see. While they are practically ubiquitous because of their cultural popularity, nothing compares or can prepare you to see them as Monet envisioned, two elliptical rooms (representing infinity) with four giant friezes encircling the walls. You feel literally immersed in them. I'd put this on par with seeing the David for the first time in Florence.But what I wasn't expecting was the Jean Walter and Pierre Guillaume collection - an expansive and impressive collection of modern art with Cezanne and Renior prominently featured. Pierre Guillaume was an important early 20th century Parisian art dealer who bequeathed his collection to the city, and is a fascinating character. As all of the descriptions are in French, the English audio guide was very helpful and provided lots of interesting information about the art, the artists and art history. It's small enough also to not be overwhelming and just spend a couple hours."

It helps if you have visited Giverny, Monet's beautiful garden outside of Paris, but one can nonetheless enjoy the massive, colourful paintings he painted, that are displayed here. He was going blind when he painted them apparently, and they have a fussy yet beautiful quality. There was an secondary exhibition downstairs, one man's collection full of Renoirs, Monets, and many other extraordinary French artists. Definitely worth a visit. We had a museum pass, and were glad of this, as we had preference to get in. I felt sorry for those who did not, and where standing out in the hot afternoon sun!

We went initially because it was included in the museum pass and we were planning a visit to Monet's house in Giverny two days later. There was a long line to get in and to buy tickets, but we were able to bypass both lines with the museum pass. The Monet waterlilies are very impressive and perfectly presented as the artist intended. The museum provides benches in the middle of the room to just sit and take it all in. We also enjoyed the rest of the exhibition. The whole museum looks very clean and bright, just a pleasant place to enjoy amazing art works. Checking your backpack is mandatory though and we were asked to take out our camera and wallet before leaving the bag. My only complaint about this museum was that the ladies working at the bag check were hands down the rudest people we met in 3 weeks in France."

I have loved Monet for most of my life now, and if you have similar feelings of fondest for one of the greatest Impressionist painters of all time, then the Musee de l'Orangerie is a must. Two large oval shaped rooms on the top floor are completely covered on all four sides by some of Monet's last works, Les Nymph\u00e9as. Those two rooms alone were absolutely stunning. But downstairs, there are even more brilliant paintings of some of the greatest artists of all time: Renoir, Monet, C\u00e9zanne, Rousseau, Matisse, Modigliani, Soutine, Laurencin, Utrillo, Derain, and Picasso. As far as Parisian art museums, this is definitely one of the smallest, but it was my favorite. If you have any interest in Monet or you adore one of the other artists, I highly recommend this museum to you! =] Bring an open mind and some leisure time, because this a place where you want to be free to wander around for a while. You aren't allowed to take pictures, so give yourself some extra time to commit these beautiful works of art to memory. Also, if you have a moment, they have a great gift shop to check out in between sections!For those of you in a huge hurry, you probably only need an hour or two tops to zip through. But trust me, once you step inside, you'll practically have to tear yourself away. Because this museum is just that fantastic. Just sit back and enjoy it, all you beautiful people!

No photography permitted (but lots of pictures taken by people on their mobile phones!!) Downstairs there was a large gallery of Cezanne, Picasso, Manet, Renior, Matisse to name but a few .. however there were also a large number of plates where the original was on loan to another gallery.

In the last weekend of July, I went first thing in the morning and found absolutely no line...walked right in. I had purchased a combo ticket on-line for both l'Orangerie and D'Orsay. That was a big mistake. Even though I purchased it right from the museum website, It turns out you have to go pick it up somewhere else. You cannot \"redeem\" your receipt from the on-line purchase at either museum. Very frustrating! The staff tried really hard to help me, but in the end it meant walking many more blocks and back, so instead I just purchased another ticket on site...my knees thanked me! OK, back to the art...the Monet waterlilies are simply amazing...Monet created them especially for this building and location and the connecting oval rooms invite a reciprocal experience with the paintings that is hard to describe. This quiet moment of sitting and taking in the beauty should not be missed. Be sure to watch the video on Monet downstairs that is shown in English at several times during the day."

There is a large oval bench in the center of the room so you can sit and reflect on the wonder of the genius."

There are some nice works and our daughter enjoyed the audioguide but the lighting downstairs is marginal and it is not equipped to handle crowds. The groups taking photos at every famous picture were obtrusive and ther was no way to avoid them. No ropes by the painings meant these people prevented you from really enjoying what was there."

Although they both feature the same era of art, they provide totally opposite experiences. The d'Orsay is of course much more spectacular with more art and an incredible building, but l'Orangerie has some interesting pieces and has something the d'Orsay doesn't--the long panels of Monet's waterlilies. I can't emphasize enough how fabulous it was to sit on the benches in the two rooms that feature these masterpieces and just stare at the paintings in the cool atmosphere where people aren't jostling you and you don't feel like you have to rush from painting to painting in order to see it all. I visited in the late afternoon, and I doubt this museum is ever very busy. It did get busy when I was there with people taking refuge from a rainstorm, but luckily we were finished by then. I can't explain how breathtaking the water lily panels are--way beyond my expectations and even more compelling to us because we had visited Giverny two days before. I can't recommend this museum enough especially for people who only have a couple of days in Paris and not enough time to see the d'Orsay or for people who like to sit and relax and really enjoy Monet."

The lower floor houses the collection of Paul Guillaume, a Parisian art dealer from the twenties. It is an excellent collection and well worth the visit"

Photography is not allowed, and it is worth coming to this museum just to see them. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the bathroom downstairs is useful if you are walking in or through the Tuilleries and the museum pass gains admission to a free bathroom and allows you to see and maybe appreciate world famous artwork that you never expected to.

Visiting the Musee de l'Orangerie for the first time, after glimpsing it in the movie Midnight in Paris, I found taking the time to view the Monet Nymphea masterpieces in their panoramic splendour (as the master intended) very moving. Monet gave instructions in the immediate post WW1 period that the paintings of the waterlillies from his Giverny pond were to be displayed in their full glory, including with the white ante-chamber to gain the necessary frame of mind to fully appreciate the healing properties of the works. Despite there being quite a few other viewers, I found that the atmosphere in the two salles was calm, reverential and the hushed surroundings enabled me to see the full scope of these truly great panorama paintings. Definitely a fine opportunity to shed the last vestiges of work-stress, and start enjoying the holiday. Next time I visit Paris, I think I will come here first!Th lower floor also has many fine art works of the impressionist and later periods."

Well, this relative small collection has some real gems of Renoir and Cezanne but the real thrill of this museum is experiencing the giant canvases of Monet's Waterlillies collection. Over 8 walls in 2 rooms are spread some of the largest canvases you'll likely encounter. What amazed and puzzled me is that a distance, you \"Get the Picture\" but at an arm's length (the distance that Monet would be standing to paint, nothing makes sense - it seems like chaos. Sitting back on the benches taking in these beautiful images, is a perfect counterbalance to the sensual overload that you get in the d'Orsay.

Having visited Paris a number of times I did not think to check Trip Advisor for things to do until I had a free moment and found the very high rating for the Musee de L'Orangerie. Since it was just a few minutes from our hotel we decided to visit and were richly rewarded. 2 rooms designed by Monet to house the waterlillies, compete with natural light and seating that encouraged you to bask in the wonder and accomplishment of this artist. And as others have said, relatively few people. Take the time to visit and immerse yourself in Monet's great work.And then downstairs there is a range of works by Matisse, Picasso, Gaugin, Cezanne, etc"

Free with the Paris Museum and Monuments Pass.- lots of interesting and colourful and varied artwork to see- for photographers, non-flash photography is allowed in the main collection. Be careful setting white balance however to get accurate colours.CONS- no photography is allowed in Nympheas- no tripods are allowed at allWell worth the visit. I would suggest that you visit the website. It will give you an indication of the artwork on display, as well as prices and information about getting there.http://www.musee-orangerie.fr/"

We visited Monet's house and garden at Giverny 2 days later which made this museum more meaningful."

The scale of the paintings are really amazing. The photography exhibit that was there was not my taste, but the fact that with the Paris Museum Pass you walk to the front of the line means I didn't spend hours waiting to see essentially just the Water Lilies. (Through there are some other exceptional painting on display.) I wouldn't choose this small museum over the Louvre or the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, but it is worth stopping in if you have the Paris Museum Pass."

Downstairs, the museum displays the renowned collection of Walter Guillaume, a dealer and collector of Impressionist masterworks at the turn of the 20th century. Security is tight here (as at all major Paris museums), but not a huge inconvenience. If you like the Impressionists, especially Monet; or would love to learn more about them; the Orangerie is the place to be, for a full day or even just an afternoon. The museum bookstore is just so-so, but the paintings themselves are displayed with good multilingual commentary on the artists' methods and styles."

Entrance lines were long on the day I visited, however, with a museum pass, I only had to wait a few minutes. The Monet rooms were crowded, but not nearly as much as other Paris art museums. (It would be amazing to see the waterlilies when the gallery was empty!) Although you can examine the works up close, the seating in the center of the rooms lets you appreciate them on a grand scale.

I was glad I didn't pay the 5 euro because the museum is quite small. Given the volume of the works and the price, I don't quite understand the amount they charge for the audio guide. I visited d'Orsay before coming here so it was tough for me not to make the comparison of the value of the audio guide relative to the information I get.

If you want to feel out of time, to have a quiet pause in your Paris tour, try and enjoy this zen experience."

However, it was simply breathtaking to see Monet's Nymph\u00e9as - the scale of the paintings lends to them an additional air of grandeur, and you feel truly fortunate to enjoy such beauty. I sat in the salle for quite some time, just taking in the paintings, my eyes picking up something new every second.Art aside, this is a lovely, very peaceful space, lots of light and height, so one doesn't feel claustrophobic even when there are lots of people around. Accessible for wheelchair users, which is great, and the facilities are also pretty good. Had a laugh with the security guards over the fact that I had my iPad in my bag - staff are friendly too!This is a do-not-miss if you are in Paris."

Don\u2019t bother with the audio device they have at this museum, it is not worth the five Euros they want for it. In addition, they want another five Euros for the audio for the special exhibition. This is a total rip off. Don\u2019t pay for either. There were no printed English instructions or guide available. All other languages were available, just not English. The staff at the desk where they had all other instructions did not apologize for the absence of the English version; they seemed bothered by the fact that we wanted them. They are definitely NOT concerned about English customers or their needs. I observed this both coming into the museum and leaving and different personnel were manning the desk."

It is not just Monet although that is of course the highlight. Downstairs you will find the collection of Guillarme a prolific collector of artwork in the late 1800's/early 1900's. Although his wife got rid of a lot of his collection upon his death, the collection is really a staggering amount of Renoir, Picasso, Matisse, and introduces us to other important lesser known today artists of that time and is really quite remarkable. I highly recommend getting the headphones for the tour of the permanent collection, it really brings this amazing collection to life and gives it context.I would say you can easily see most of the works in a good two hours or so."

The location of the museum in the Tuileries Gardens is also a plus and it overlooks Place de la Concorde. Plan to see these two famous sights as well when you go. One tip is to buy a double pass for both Orangerie and Musee d'Orsay. You save money and get to experience two great museums! Go to both within four days of when you bought the first ticket."

Go downstairs for the regular art gallery, which has some nice Renoirs and notable French painters. The Debussy (temporary) exhibition was really well-done, with English, French and Italian(?) explanations for each stage, no need for the audioguide. You can come in for free on first Sundays of the month. You can also bypass the queue if you have the museum pass, are pregnant, or elderly with a cane.

They are arranged in two oval rooms with natural, though diffused, lighting from the skylights. These paintings are not just impressive by their size (I\u2019d guess four are 8ft high by 30ft wide and the other four are 8ft high by 15ft wide) but their imagery. I\u2019m not an artist or art historian (or really much of an enthusiast) but was amazed by the display.

I did not give it excellent because I think if you bought the ticket independently (7.50 euros, plus extra if you want the audioguide) compared to the 10 euros for the Louvre for the permanent collections, you would feel a bit cheated. The museum is small and can be done in less than 2 hours if you are not the type to meditate in the room with the large Nympheas. But, having said that, this is the one to go to in order to pay homage to Monet and his famous Nympheas. They are absolutely breathtaking and if you are an artist you either want to quit or go home and create so more until you get it right.Get the Paris Museum Pass so that you can see the Louvre, the Orsay and many, many other sights and this will be worth it. On a nice day, you stroll through the Tuileries Gardens either to or from the Louvre. After the mass crowds at the Louvre and Orsay, this is a nice quiet time."

The reason is the 2 oval rooms with Monet's nymphaeas.I could seat and watch it for a very long time and it's always a great pleasure.If you love Monet's creations you should absolutely visit here and also visit the Marmotan museum which is dedicated to his creations. Having said that - if you don't have enough time to travel & visit the Marmotan don't miss this charming small museum - the nympheaes are ravishing!"

In fact the building had been closed for both my prior trips, and my exposure to my favorite artist work had been limited to the Orsay, and a few private collections.The effect of these grand works of Monet, to me are overwhelming. I can look at them for any long period of time. Their beauty is beyond me, and thinking about them, the effort, the madness, and love it took to create them.. it brings tears to my eyes. by far the most amazing works of art I have ever seen."

Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie never seems as crowded as the larger, more well-known art museums in Paris, but it houses many delights and is the perfect experience for the art-lover and uninitiated alike. The collection is not large, but the quality of works by well-known artists such as Renoir and Degas is high, and the best treat of all are the two large circular rooms which house Monet's incredible 'Nymph\u00e9as' (waterlilies) paintings. Completed in his later years, specifically for this space, the paintings are large semi-abstract interpretations of Monet's water-lily pond at Giverny (a highly-recommended day trip from Paris) The paintings surround you, and it's a wonderfully calming experience to spend some time on the comfortable chairs in the centre of the room, breathing in the sense of peace and harmony with nature that Monet has lovingly created. Visit Giverny first if you can, where you will see photos of the paintings at different stages of execution. ( If your thirst for Monet's work remains unquenched, and you've already been to the top floor of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, you could also try the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan.)"

Downstairs there is a good but small permanent collection of the usual impressionist and early modernist masters and usually a temporary curated themed exhibition. It has one of the best Renoir collections.If have already seen the Louvre and you do not feel like a big full-on day in a large gallery/museum L'Orangerie is a very satisfying an uplifting option. You can also walk along the river or across the park from The Louvre to get there."

The Monets are quite wonderful in two special viewing rooms. There was a special temporary exhibition related to Debussy, but I found the proposed connection between the visual art and the music to be tenuous for the majority of what was presented.If you're on the hunt for more Monets, make sure to consider the Musee Marmottan Monet in the 16th. Michel Monet bequeathed quite a few of his father's large format water lily paintings to that museum and they're breathtaking in a specially designed room."

You could spend hours just admiring the water lillies, or if you are on a busy schedule then you could whizz round in under an hour, although that would be a shame!"

There are some other great works in this museum, but probably the most practical reason to go is that it is not as crowded as some of the other big museums, and you can be in and out in a short time. My suggestion is to start at Chatelet metro, walk down the shops on Rue de Rivoli, walk through the Tuileries until you get to L'Orangerie, pop into the museum, and then walk the Champs until the Arc. A perfect day of sightseeing, museums, and shopping. Plenty of great places to stop and eat or get a coffee along the way."

We had to wait for well over an hour in Paris's springtime drizzle. To avoid waiting in winter cold and snow, we booked tickets on-line. It turned out to be unecessary, however; we could walk right in! So the booking fee of 1\u00bd euros per person was wasted this time -- but it's good to know that one can avoid the lines!"

It is best to see it before heading out to Giverny as it will provide you with a preview of how to fully appreciate his Water Garden and water lilies. The light reflections in each of the water lily water color panels are so realistic with the different times of the day. You need to just stay focused on the panels and see the change in the lighting. Up front it appears as just a blob but at a distance it is a definite unique piece of picture.Take your time in the viewing rooms to appreciate them. Sit down, contemplate and just imagine yourself at the Water Garden in Giverny. It will definitely prepare your visit to Giverny. Monet was definitely an unique impressionist artist of his time.Get a Paris Museum pass to avoid the long line to get in the Musee de l'Oragerie. There is a separate line (quicker) for Museum pass holders."

I have to say that l'Orangerie is my favourite. It is situated in an exquisite part of Paris near the Tuillerie Gardens and the Place de la Concorde. It has a wonderful history, where at one time, it narrowly escaped being condemned. But pleased to say it avoided the guillotine , it has survived, and has gone on to become a jewel in the crown. When you arrive at l'Orangerie, the first thing you will notice from the outside is that it is much smaller than many other museums. In fact, once inside you only have to negotiate a couple of floors. This is a great advantage as, unlike the Louvre, you do not get lost and spend hours walking the length and breadth of the building. I love the simplicity of The L'orangerie. Near the ticket office are a series of photographic tableaux which explain the life of Monet and the Water Lilies...How Monet was going blind when he painted the Water-Lilies and how his hands were almost paralysed with arthritis. There is also an audio-visual show about Monet. Be sure to see it. All this history is very helpful before you are swept off your feet by the beauty and the sheer size of Monet's masterpiece, \"The Water-Lilies\". I was able to view the Water Lilies for over two hours as there is comfortable circular seating there. Once you are done with Monet's \"Nymphaes\", visit the Impressionist floor as this is an absolute must. As you walk along the corridor, you are in for an absolute treat. You will see a fine collection of Renoir's, Van Gogh's and Gauguin works and many others. Many of them are their most celebrated works. Again, I mention how great it is to see these master pieces and not have to walk miles within the museum looking for them. I can well understand why the French love this museum so much, and to think that only a few year's ago , this museum was the best kept secret in Paris. In conclusion, the staff are friendly, the decor is bright and modern, and the tariff is very reasonable. Tips: 1. Get there early for pole position in the Water-Lilies Room. 2. Don't forget to view the Impressionist Paintings on lower floor. 3. L'Orangerie is closed Tuesdays. 4. See the Real\" Water-lilies\" that Monet painted at Monet's Gardens at Giverny. (Only a short trip from Paris)."

M d'O was really overwhelming - but L'Orangerie is simpler with a magnificent collection but small enough not to exhaust. Though both are must-dos in Paris.Paul Guillame's collection downstairs is an eclectic mix of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism plus, with Modigliani, Monet, Renoir, Utrillo, Rousseau, Verain and Picasso etc. Stunning.However the highlight are the 2 oval rooms on the top floor devoted to Monet's massive lily canvases. Great to be here on a winter's day with few people to obscure the view but sunny so the filtered light warmed these rooms.Beautiful...And the building itself, ain't half bad!"

I've recommended to several friends that they start their day with an early morning walk through the tuileries, then head here, then visit Angelina across the street for hot chocolate, then head on to another museum or location for the afternoon. Also, it's not the best place for rowdy kids as they ask for near absolute silence in the main rooms upstairs."

It takes awhile to \"get focused\"--translating the impressionist's medium, not into \"what it looks like\" but into our own impressions of serene ponds, reeds, water lilies, glints of color and sparkly light on rivulets from a whisper of wind.After losing ourselves in just walking around the rooms, we started to talk about what kind of a patient genius it would take to capture and convey these extraordinary scenes and his compelling need and artistic capability to do so. I love the Louvre and d'Orsay for their variety of great art; the physical space of both museums is beyond description. But, it is the panels that bring me that rush of emotion even as I think of them now. Don't miss this place, until after you reluctantly walk out the door of the museum."

Someone had suggested Musee de l'Orangerie so we followed the road towards the Tuilleries and found it very easily although little is mentioned of it in guide books and it is not often sign-posted. Is it Paris' best kept secret? Best of all, no queue! A short wait to go through the ubiquitous security screen, the usual fee to enter and we were in. Previous readers are right about the lovely Monet screens but there is much more to this museum than Monet. Downstairs there is some amazing art and I fast became an admirer of Tissot and his portraiture. We stayed a long time in l'Orangerie and it was worth every penny. On the way out you will be directed through the obligatory shop but this time you might just be surprised at the modest price of the souvenirs."

If you are a Monet fan, the l'Orangerie is a must-do - the two rooms featuring the huge waterlily paintings by Monet are absolutely stunning, and truly achieve Monet's vision of providing people with a quiet, beautiful and peaceful space in the city.The rest of the l'Orangerie's permanent collection is also quite impressive (the Walter-Guillame collection), featuring a number of works by Cezanne, Renoir, Picasso (though there aren't any of his Cubist works) and Modigliano. The audio guide is worth getting if you are interested in the background to paintings, as it was quite informative and there is little information on the panels next to the paintings.The l'Orangerie was my favourite museum in Paris - the collection, whilst much smaller than that of the d'Orsay and Louvre, is of high quality and well put-together."

You would be surprised at my answer. I came because I wanted to see if I can get in for free--yes i did 26 and under EU is free... I had no clue his water lilies were here..But boy oh boy..was it beautiful. It was a room with water lilies painted on the walls...with benches in the middle and everyone just enjoying the artwork. There's two rooms, and both were drastically different but beautiful all at the same time. It's a SMALL museum but his work is beautiful so you should definitely come if you like his work. No Photos allowed :( Downstairs are some of other artists works...you can take photos at some portions downstairs. I think I finished within an hour because it's tiny. So I went back for a second look at the lilies :PThe sinks in the restrooms are a bit..different..you have to step on the handle thing on the floor to start the water! FYI :)"

One can see everything, every work, linger at will and still see it all in 3 hours. It is not a museum where one has to pick and choose which works to find and see, because it is not so huge. However, this collection has Monet's famous Water Lillies, lots of Picasso, Cezanne, Renoir, Modigliani, Rousseau, Soutine and many, many more artists working in the early part of the 20th century. If time is an issue, forget the D'Orsay and the Louvre and visit l'Orangerie instead! If visiting solo, I recommend renting the informative headset. It is quite well done, full of interesting information and gives one the sense of being alone with the artwork."

The Orangerie also has a wonderful collection of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings. I'd seen many of them when they were exhibited in Australia a few years ago while the Orangerie was being renovated, and it was good to see them again in their \"home\". Make sure you go for a stroll in the Tuileries afterwards!"

Then the flow takes you down a level where the galleries are packed with many other masters: Picasso, Renoir, Matisse and Cezanne to name a few. The Musee de l'Orangerie is a very manageable size. If you only have one day to see Paris museums, come here. And if you can choose from any Paris sight and you want to soak up the masterpieces of color and style, make sure you visit l'Orangerie.

The queue for those without reservations was not long but it moves very slowly - particularly as those with reservations or the dual museum pass are continually jumping to the front. We started at the top corner of the grass triangle and it took a good 30 minutes to get in (and then another 5-10 inside to actually buy the tickets). So nothing compared to the bigger attractions but unpleasant standing out exposed for that time on a cold, windy, rainy day. So why not bypass it? Easiest way to do this is with the combination \"passport\" with the musee d'orsay - or via an online reservation. For the latter I believe you will need to be able to print the reservation - a practical challenge for travellers."

The Museum guide explains that the empty vestibule decorated with nothing but white paint was conceived as a place to \"decompress\" - a zone between the frenetic pace outside and the peaceful calm within. And peaceful it was - the two large oval rooms housing Monet's monumental paintings are places for inner reflection. The water lilies themselves are merely a backdrop to reflections of the sky, clouds and gardenscape of Monet's garden at different times of day and season. Float away the stresses of the day like the water lilies! After decompression, you will be in the right frame of mind to contemplate the other artworks in the collection."

People either walked quietly or sat in the middle to take in the artwork. It was a welcome respite in my day. Downstairs, there was a bit more of a crowd for the special exhibit of Spanish art. There were also works of Renoir, Cezanne and others on the other side of the downstairs level. The approach is also from the lovely Jardin Tuilleries. Perfect for taking a nice stroll through the park and then capping it off with this museum. Overall it was a wonderful experience."

When we went there later, we only took 10 minutes to get in whereas the main queue would have had us in the rain for over an hour!Back to the Orangerie - take time to pause in the white vestibule before going into the 2 rooms of Nympheas. The size of these pictures is overwhelming. Take time, sit and just look for as long as you want.On the down side - watch out outside. A 'nice' young lady pointed out a wedding ring on the floor, which couldn't possibly be hers and would have loved us to have it - for a finder's fee!

Once we got in, we were out in 15 minutes because there weren't that many exhibitions.

After a day of shopping and walking down St. Honore, my husband and I headed through the Tuileries Gardens. First, before heading the Musee, spend some time sitting in the chairs around the fountain in the garden! It was warm and we were in heavenly bliss, so relaxed! We then headed through the gardens to the Musee de l'Orangerie after a long day of walking, and what a lovely way to end our day! The gardens themselves are very beautiful, romantic, and help you imagine what life was like in 1800's Paris.We went straight into Les Nympheas, the two oval round rooms dedicated to Monet's exquisite and serene paintings of his gardens. I found the history fascinating, that the exhibit was created during his lifetime, but he died shortly before it opened. The beauty of his work mirrored our restful and romantic walk through the Tuileries, and now I can't wait to visit Giverny. We then headed downstairs to a special exhibit of Paul Guillaume's collection of outstanding artists of his time -- Cezanne, Renoir, Matisse, Picasso...no way! Wow! This museum was small and easy to see in an hour, a great \"pow\" in a small space. Excellent experience overall."

We included the Orangerie in our museum day with the Paris museum pass...well worth the price! A chance to see his water lilies in the setting that he had planned for their display made for a life-long memory for us! There are eight large panels displayed in two oval rooms with sky lights above, giving the feeling of actually being at Monet's water garden in Giverny. We had been to Giverny to see it in person just the day before, so that helped to make the paintings even more meaningful. The museum was not crowded at all, giving us a chance to see the paintings at our leisure. My grandson enjoyed comparing the view of the paintings from the center of the room and then up close to study Monet's technique. He found it interesting that some random-looking brush strokes can turn into water lilies when viewed from a distance! We did not spend any time visiting the rest of the museum since we also had the nearby Louvre and Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay on our list for the day. The water lilies were certainly one of the highlights of our visit! If you are there with children, be sure to allow time for sailing a little boat in the fountain at the Tuileries gardens...right beside the Orangerie. It was a nice little chance for some down time between museum visits."

The eight paintings, approx. 6 1/2 ft. high X 42 ft. long are displayed in two oval rooms all along the walls under direct diffused daylight as was originally intended by Monet. You are enveloped by the colors, and the movement, and the mood. There is seating in the middle of each room, so one can absorb and contemplate. The museum also houses other great impressionist works by Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso and many more that were in the Paul Guillaume collection - there are small models of his apartment circa the 20's, 30's with many famous paintings..

This, being my fifth trip to Paris, still left plenty to see. I had never been to L'Orangie. My fiance had been there years ago, but never mentioned it on our past trips. This time around, it was on my priority list because I wanted to see the Monets. Nestled in the Jardins des Tuileries not too far from a beautiful lavender patch, are the steps leading to this great little museum. We were lucky, as the line was extremely small. The Monets did not dissappoint. However, the gallery in which his water lilly painting and the other Giverny paintings. The paintings are spectacular. The colors are so soothing and just pretty. Sitting on a bench to soak it in, you really can get the feeling of being in water. I swear it is almost like being in a painting acquarium. My only \"ugh\" moment was that there were too many people at this exhibit. I know, I know, I sound like a hypocrite because we didn't have a long line to wait on, but most of the people at the museum were crowded into this exhibit. Naturally, in all my selfishness--and the fact that I'm becoming French by osmosis, I grouchily wished everyone would have gone away and just left us with the paintings. Now THAT would have been a totally tranquil few moments! The paintings truly were a magnificant site and now going to Giverny is high on the priority list for the next trip. That being said, (sorry I rambled) the remainder of the museum's galleries were a fantastic surprise. We had no idea that L'Orangie housed so many beautiful Renoirs!! And ohhh..how beautiful they were. Renior's nudes are just breathtaking! Picasso, Soutine, and Cezanne were among the other artist's whose paintings graced the gallerie's walls. You don't need more than an hour to enjoy this small museum. It isn't overwhelming. It is observing art at a very nice pace.After your exit, you will still be in the mood for a nice stroll in the Jardins...stop at a cafe for a nice coffee or citron presse...do some serious people watching...sit back, close your eyes, and daydream about beautiful works of art that you just saw!Please don't pass this gem by...had I known about it a few years ago, I would have made this a \"must see\" on my first visit to Paris!Thank you for reading and enjoy the sights of Paris!"

Now I realize that the Marmottan Monet Museum and the Orangerie are as good as, if not better than d'Orsay, to enjoy Monet's works. The Orangerie houses the masterpiece of Monet, the Nympheas, in two oval-shaped rooms. The Nympheas comprise eight hugh paintings, with 'Sunset', 'Clouds', 'Morning' and 'Green Reflections' in the first room, and 'Morning Willows', 'Willows on a Clear Morning', 'Reflection of Trees' and 'The Two Willows' in the second room. When I entered the first room, my immediate reaction was 'wow'! These masterpieces are just stunning and mesmerizing. Other works by Monet, and those by Renoir, Cezanne, Mattise and Picasso are also exhibited in the museum. Moreover, photography (without flash) is allowed in the museum. Orangerie is truly a gem not to be missed by Monet lovers. Orangerie is about 600 meters from d'Orsay. So one can visit both museums in one day. However, photography is not allowed in d'Orsay."

Monet's Water Lilies fill two stunning light filled rooms, and downstairs some truy iconic paintings by Renoir, Sisely, Cezanne, Picasso, Gaugin, Derain, Matisse and Modigliani...and right outside the front door, Rodin's 'The Kiss'."

Monet's water lilies are there in a lovely, quiet room where one can sit, rest, reflect, meditate. Beautiful presentation of the water lilies and numerous other artworks. Very nice gift shop. In the lower level we discovered more pieces by some of the greats....Picasso, Renoir, Matisse and others. Just a wonderful place to visit and one we will always return to when in Paris.

Musee de l'Orangerie is centrally located on the bank of the Seine River in the old orangery of the Tuileries Palace on the Place de la Concorde in Paris, near the Concorde metro station. I feel that this gallery is the ideal museum to introduce art to children while in Paris. Unlike the Louvre, which is quite overwhelming and overcrowded, the Musee de l\"Orangerie offers a smaller setting, seating and an overall pleasant and engaging environment. However, don't let the size fool ya! This museum offers a impressive collection of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings. It contains works by artists such as Paul C\u00e9zanne, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri Rousseau and many others.In an Infinity style on the ground floor, there are circular rooms displaying beautiful cycles of Monet's water-lily paintings. These series of paintings are known as the Nympheas, and are simply amazing...a must do.Before you go, I would STRONGLY recommend investing in the Paris Museum Pass, the website is as follows;http://en.parismuseumpass.com/There are options of 2, 4 or 6 days. With this pass, one has access to over 60 Museums and most importantly...no waiting in lines which can be very, very long. Museums include the Oragerie, Louvre and Orsay museums...among many others."

This two experiences together make them all the richer. When I have kids and my husband and I take them to Paris for the first time we will skip the Louvre and go straight to the L'Orangerie.

I had the Paris Museum Pass (or what ever it's called) so can't comment on value for entry fee, but I'd be surprised if anyone felt cheated. As with most galleries and museums in Paris, captions for the works are in French and there is little literature available, so get an audio guide if you can. We visited on a weekday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised not to find excessive queues or groups of tourists. The gallery is comparatively small, and combined with the reasonable flow of visitors, it made quite a nice change to the usual throng of the Louver or D'Orsay, etc. My understanding is that the gallery is purpose built for Monet's Water Lilly collection, and as such they are quite moving, although I felt the D'Orsay actually held a better collection of Monet's early work.Although I did enjoy the collection and will certainly visit again, I did not leave feeling awed, inspired or particularly enlightened. In some ways, this felt more like an exhibition, rather than permanent collection, perhaps partially because of the lack information (purely my own fault for not speaking ONE word of French) and partially because the collections (mostly Renoir, Gauguin and Cezanne) felt like the left-overs after the bigger and more prestigious galleries had their pick. Having said that, these paintings are still invaluable and worth a visit, but perhaps only for the more eager art enthusiasts than as a top tourist necessity."

The moment I get my ticket, I go straight for Monet's \"Nympheas\", which are displayed in two large rooms under soft light, as the artist had intended them to be seen. The space they are kept in is large and peaceful, which allows you to be immersed in the splendor of the paintings. I usually spend (and encourage you to do the same) around forty-five minutes in the Nympheas area, because it is worth it!Afterwards, you can head downstairs to see some more great artwork, from C\u00e9zanne to Picasso. It is downstairs that I can think of the only negative aspect of the museum, as the C\u00e9zanne/Renoir works are displayed in a fairly narrow corridor, which means that one cannot stand back and appreciate the works in their fullest. Nevertheless, the collection downstairs is impressive, to say the least. Moreover, the temporary exhibitions are always of an excellent standard and definitely worth your while.What more can I say?

We were tired when we went, but it's so absolutely stunning that we both felt sad when we thought we'd seen it all (we hadn't, the downstairs is amazing). For me, it was the perfect short introduction to Impressionism and made all the difference in how I approached the D'Orsay. We had been in the Louvre all day, and I thought I was arted out, truthfully, then the joy that is Monet's Waterlilies...what an amazing place.There were children and old people, and lots of French people. People treated it as a sacred space. We tried to take pictures (no way to capture it). It's soothing, has plenty of seating for we weary older travelers, and is a not to be missed part of the Paris experience. Afterwards, we just sat outside in the Gardens and marveled - of course at Monet and his vision, but also at the other Impressionists collected in the basement. It helped me realize why the Louvre had to have a cut-off point timewise or...it would be just stuffed too full of art. Some of the earliest known paintings are found in France, of course, and there's something about Monet and the presentation in the L'Orangerie (I don't want to say too much - it's just best to go and see it yourself) that provides a look back into the reasons why people paint, and how art is universal and why we love art.It is on the Paris Museum Pass. It does not take hours to see and is a perfect museum for children. There's lots of great curators' remarks (although I believe they may have been in French) and an English guided tour twice a week (Mondays and Thursdays at 2:30 pm) if you're the tour-wanting kind of person (although I believe the museum totally reveals itself to all who visit).C\u00e9zanne, Renoir, Picasso, Rousseau, Matisse, Derain, Modigliani, Soutine, Utrillo and Laurencin as well as others are all represented there. Before our trips to Paris, I think I was only marginally an art lover - and L'Orangerie may be the place where I really saw the light. It's so hard to compare museums, though - but this is one of Paris's must-sees."

This is a very nice museum because it is on the smaller size, but still has many famous artists, including Monet, Renoir, Picasso, Matisse. It is in the Tuilleres Gardens and covered by a museum pass so it is worth a stop if you are there anyways."

This main exhibit in within two large ellipliptical shaped rooms on the first floor and here you are literally surrounded by his work. Sitting on the bench in the middle of the room is a great way to enjoy the water lilies.The rest of the museum is on the floor below and very good although not large in size. You can spend an hour and half to see the entire museum. The audio guide is 5 euros and tells you quite a bit of background on key paintings. The gift shop is very well stocked wtih a large selection of poster prints."

Bonus feature is Rodin sculpture in front. The advertised attraction is Monet's waterlilies and they are amazing, but the draw for me was the collection downstairs. Such a mixture! Renoir, Cezanne, Picasso, Matisse and Modigliani. This is one of the many museums on the Museum Pass list."

It is at the end of the Jardin Tulleries near where the massive pool is just in front of the Obelisque de Louxor. Go up the ramp on the south side and make a left. They make you check in your backpack/bag (free). It is absolutely fantastic for monet lovers. His massive water lilies were hung along the walls of two large rooms. There were some impressive works downstairs too. It's a small quiet, museum and gives you just the right amount of things to see. Depending on how long you end up gazing at the Monet's for.... you can probably allocate 1 to 1.5 hrs for this musuem... but it will be one of the best museums in Paris that you can visit."

This art museum is a great, quick escape for those visiting the Tuileries/Louvre/Place de Concorde area and is a must-see for those who appreciate Impressionist art. The whole museum can easily be explored in about an hour, unless you decide to linger in the spacious, tranquil, rounded rooms that house Monet's amazing Nymph\u00e9as paintings. The Nymph\u00e9as collection consists of his famous, panoramic water lily scenes. Sitting on the benches in the middle of the naturally lit galleries, it's easy to get lost in the abstract, emotive brushstrokes that make up the massive, yet serene landscapes. The lower level of the museum has more interesting impressionist and post-impressionist works on display that's worth exploring."

            "review": "It was OK. I would agree with Idra. We visited this past April and it was rather uninspiring. I am a museum professional and unfortunately they take a rather mundane art museum approach to labeling the collection. It is not very creative. The way finding is awful and we completely missed the video. In fact, we did not know it existed until I read the review and we went through the whole place. I am a huge Monet fan so the paintings were awesome, but I would have liked more information about who, what, when and why. The guidebooks gave me more information than the museum did about why the work was there. This was our 4th trip to Paris and we thought it was about time to see those museums that are not the usual one. I am glad we did, just wish I had been more enlightened and inspired by the interpretation. The staff did nothing to help in making sure that we knew there were other interpretive materials (i.e. the video or audio guide) available when we bought our tickets or entered the gallery spaces. We did not experience any crowds and we did not get there until 3:00ish on a beautiful, sunny spring day in Paris. I would recommend it, but don't go out of your way."

            "review": "Interesting but let down by a lack of direction for visitors... I shall explain.. Whilst I am not mad on Monet I am interested in his work so I purchased a joint passport ticket for the Orangerie along with the d'Orsay. This had the advantage of skipping the line at the Orangerie. Bonus.I went in and headed straight for the Monets along with everyone else. What do you see? Really big Monets. Large. Massively so. Beautiful, yes... but as someone not very familiar with the 'point' of these particular works I meandered around and then went on.And here's the thing. I am an obsessive map reader, folloer of signs and so on and I had missed this entirely when I arrived. There is a movie available. It's on downstairs. Look for a door into a dark room. Please do look for it as it's a very, *very* good documentary with English subtitles about these particular works. Why they were painted. The stage of Monet's life and mind at the time. What they represent. Why they are laid out as they are. How they came to be in that particular building. What they meant to Monet and to post-war France.Fascinating and it completely contextualised the paintings themselves. I immediately rushed back upstairs to look at them with my new found knowledge! What do I find? It's 5.50pm so the lights are being turned off. *le sigh* I persisted in going into the darkened room regardless because now they *meant* so much more.Please, please... if you don't know their story make sure you see the video. It helped me so much.I did not see much of the rest of the collection as I was attempting to get back to the Monets, however the portrate of Chanel was a favourite find of my trip.Shop: Stuffed with Monet tat. Monet heaven for shoppers.Facilities: Great cloakroom, poor leaflets/interpretation, super toilets."

It is small, and the crowds that we encountered in all the other museums were non existent. The impressionist art here is amazing and you don't feel overwhelmed by the amount of it. The water lillies are beautifully displayed, in round and oval rooms flooded with natural light and the atmosphere is so serene. It took us less than an hour to appreciate the whole gallery.I highly recommend this gallerey - especially to those people who are not necessarily art experts."

Opening after and extensive remodel - the museum is breathtaking. The Monet water lillies are simply a must to see in the spaces new design using natural lighting. The remaining collection from Picasso, Cezzane, Renior, and Modligiani (to name a few) is very pleasant - though some controversay in the news over the 'starkness' of the rooms with their concrete walls. We did not find it distracting or too cold of a space. I would recommend the audio guide - at 5 Euros - it did enhance the experience for us. You can easily spend 2 hours viewing the collections. The current temporary exhibit - a recreation of the a 1934 Paris exhibit at the Orangerie -bringing together for the first time these pieces of art - was impressive. It included works by Georges de la Tour - wonderful! Tip: Musee Pass helps you skip the line and quickly enter this museum. Otherwise, expect long lines since its reopening."
