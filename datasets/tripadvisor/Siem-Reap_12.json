Inside the temple sits a monk who will help you make a wish and a offering for A donation. A must see!!!"

Anghor Thom literally means 'Great City' and was the last of the Khmer's majestic capitals.This review concerns the impressive entrance gate to the City. Sharing the serene and beautifully carved faces of Bayon, the gate rises above alongside the moat and provides a narrow entrance beyond.The well preserved 50mm bridge as you approach has stone figures of the Hindu story; The myth of the churning of the ocean'. The guardian gods on the left pull the head of the snake while the demon gods on the right pull it's tail in the opposing direction. Some of the heads have been 'recently' and faithfully added, our guide telling us that they were stolen by Vietnamese 40 years ago or more."

But do not let this deter you!Anyone can walk down the middle of Angkor Thom with the masses and get caught up with selfie sticks, group photos, and disrespectful tourists. If you can handle this, go for it. My wife and I chose to walk the dirt paths around the extomerior portions, entering the locations we wanted, and gathering the beauty of the entire grounds. I would also HIGHLY recommend going to the national museum before hand to gather the history of the temples and be your own tour guide :-)"

The face on the entrance is overpowering to scaring away any enemy.More faces inside make the 12 km trip well worthwhile.Rain almost spoiled it for us but we persisted and made it through.We plainly did not have the crowds at Angkor Wat - that was a joy.

The Angkor Thom city ruins are a collection of different structures spread out in an area much larger than the Angkor Wat complex. If traveling in a tour group, you'll take your bus to most places around here, and passed off to tuktuks for smaller places. For independent travelers, you'll likely be brought here by your day-hire tuktuk driver.Nearly all tuktuk drivers will start you off at Angkor Wat first thing, but if you want to beat the crowds, you can opt to save Angkor Wat for last (you'll also be forgoing the sunrise). So start off at Angkor Thom in the morning, and you should be ahead of most independent groups for most of the day.Most likely, you'll be visiting other places in the Angkor complex on the same day. I'd strongly advise visitors to bring at least one spare battery, as there will be almost nowhere you can charge your equipment."

It is worth stopping to see these before making your way through Angkor Thom.Note there were a lot of wasps present when were there. We were fortunate not to be stung but they were quite clingy. It is easy to purchase a variety of food (such as fruit) and drinks in here. This is another area where there are lots of sellers. These women and children (mostly) are very persistent. Do not buy from the children who should be in school. They will nonetheless follow you around. If you do buy from the women, come to a fair price and be aware they start high and won't take no for an answer! You can easily purchase water, scarves, hats and various tourist tat such as pants, tops and postcards at the temples.

After that, instead of following the tour back to your hostel, just negotiate with a good English speaker tut tut to bring you around for the Grand tour to see the remaining temples (I got it for USD18).I visited almost all the major temples available but most memorable would be: Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Bayon, Prasat Ta Prum, Banteay Kdel, Prasat Prey Roup, Eastern Mebon, & Prasat Prey Khan. All of them has their own story and history with slightly different in architecture and designs. Spending a total of 14 hours here before going back to rest.Tips: Download offline map. Get a good walking shoe, umbrella, lots of drinking water (at least 3 litres), tut tut to ferry you around, food ration to recover energy (chocolate bar), Get a foot massage ranging around USD 2-4 for 30 minute should fix the leg fatigue. Calcium & magnesium helps and some warm cream would be good for muscle ache."

This place is just phenomenal...it's huge and has such a lovely variety of temples within it, it's difficult to know where to start.It's the gates that get you first! 54 gods and 54 demons fighting it out over the massive moat. The south gate especially is an astonishing site to behold. Within the 5 gates and moat are a myriad of sights...probably the most famous is the Bayon, right at its heart. But you should also take in the lovely big buddhas outside the Bayon, maybe ride an elephant, walk the Terrace of Elephants and the Terrace of the Leper King...just for starters. Ideally a day spent exploring it would do it justice. Buy a 3 day ticket (for the price of 2 days) and spread it out. Trying to cram everything in in just a morning or afternoon would be a travesty! It's also best to hire a guide in town before you get there...money well spent."

Its walls enclose a vast area (around seven square miles) and the buildings inside are of such stunning variety. The South Gate to the old city (hundreds of thousands - maybe a million people- lived here long before New York even existed) and its green moat is an awe-inspiring sight. The gate is dominated by the giant face of Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of Loving Compassion. He's everywhere in temple of Bayon, too, but so are bus-loads of other tourists plus their loud guides and I gave up on it after two abortive visits as it just wasn't fun. Never mind: nearby is the evocative ruin of another temple, the Baphuon pyramid, with great views from the upper gallery. And adjacent to that- a short peaceful walk through the emerald woods- is another sight of haunting magnificence- the royal palace, what's left of it. These are spectacular places and mercifully free of overcrowding, at least in the low season. You can also find other smaller ruins lurking in the forests. Finally there is the Terrace of Elephants... and next to it, the hidden gem of the Terrace of the Leper King: the walls of sculptured figures in its little passageways are very expressive and mostly very well-preserved - in my humble opinion, one of the finest sights around Siem Reap and not to be missed on any account. It seems the Leper King is a misnomer and that the statue (now in Phnom Penh) on top of the mound was Yama, the Lord of Death. This strange little site may have been where the kings of Angkor were cremated. Either way, to me the sculptured figures are much more fascinating than the interminable bas reliefs in Angkor Wat which get far more publicity but which are standard diagrammatic imperial fare by comparison."

Possibly it was because every time I ran into a throng of tourists there was some secluded passageway offering escape and a bit of seclusion where I could enjoy the solitude or take a photo without worrying about someone walking into the shot. Walking through the gate competing with elephants offered a circus atmosphere that was quite unique."

The approach to the S gate is through a moat lined by avenue of statues including two rows of figures each carrying the body of giant serpent - a seven headed Naga - looking as if it's in a tug of war. The centre of city is Bayon.The use of Naga balustrades lining as approach is symbolically interpreted as linking the world of men outside the temple with world of gods inside.At the base of gate tower, on either side, is another architectural invention, a three headed elephant plucking lotus flowers with it's trunks that form the pillars. The elephant is Airawata the vehicle of Indra, the god of sky as well as king of gods. Naga bridge is therefore also interpreted as divine rainbow.

At the centre of the city is Jayavarman's state temple, the Bayon, with the other major sites clustered around the Victory Square immediately to the north.\"This is such an amazing site to visit!"

Most people just go to Bayon, the most famous structure in the area, known for the many faces that adorn each of the towers. And indeed Bayon is a must see. But it's also great to have your tuk tuk driver stop at various spots, (or rent a bicycle and stop where you like!) and spend time exploring the whole complex. There are many small structures worth wandering about. They are less crowded and it's wonderful taking some restful time to sit in a grassy area just taking in the awe-inspiring scenes. Buy a snack or lunch from one of the many vendors, or take along your own picnic to enjoy a scenic break from temple visits. Don't miss the elephant terrace within the complex. It's magnificent walls carved with giant elephant scenes, and the large elephant sculptures guarding the entrance are stunning."

I went twice to return for pictures late afternoon and enjoyed it best over early morning crowds.most people skip the Gallery walks of carvings of everyday life and the aspara dancers. My favorite.mi found the section where the women helping a woman in labor and the next scene women helping woman giving birth. The animals, birds, trees, men betting at a cock fight, men cooking fish on a stick, alligator taking a bite of a person's leg, oxen, elephants.... The exquisite carvings on ground level of the Galleries worth the time especially if interested in seeing the everyday lives 1,000 years ago. Then suddenly the carvings end...why?! The King has died and the carving artists return to their villages to home, I was told by docent. A viable Temple with a prominent Buddha worthy of a prayer and blessing. Cover shoulders and knees I was told as a woman for respect to the monks. Try to read ahead before touring as limited signage and history provided. Most eastern tourists use this location for group photo background shots over the historically significant cultural stories this magnificent monument holds. Angkor Thom is the ancient faces once of gold of Cambodia - worth purchasing a book!"

The faces are calm yet powerful enveloping you in its spell. Walking though many of its temple you are taken back in time wondering about the bustling life. The beauty about Siem Reap's temples are its eroding stone structures and natures hold on it, but you cannot help wondering how it must have been in all its glory. Siem Reap's temples are a must visit."

Make sure to carry a good camera and lots of sunscreen and water along with you because views are breathtaking, sun is hard and you need to walk a lot. But at every stage you feel amazed. We took a bus with wifi from Phnom Penh around 9pm and reached Siem Reap in the morning. You can get tut tut (or tuktuk) easily and make sure to wintness the epic sunrise. Take lots of pictures and just forget everything and welcome the sun. Good luck for your epic journey."

Angkor Thom will keep you busy for the rest of the day.. to the point where one temple just blends into the next.. and you need to start keeping score of what you are actually looking at.. Bayon Temple being the centre of Angkor Thom... and then a medley of more palaces, lakes, Baphuon, the terrace of this the terrace of that.. by this time, a map and a guide book would be very well needed.. to understand the complexity and intricate history and who built what temple for whom during what century... for the untrain historian.. more rocks / bricks / faces / carvings (and the odd wild bee's nest) for the fitness fanatic.. more to climb and train / run through for the archeologist.. more Disneyland to explore. Hystorically speaking.. another expression of religous ferver.. based on Mount Meru. From the moment you enter the fantastic gates, its a small leap to imagine life in the 13th century."

Just to clear things up.angkor thom is not a specific temple but a city like area that has alot of temples in it including bayon and others,make sure to have a picture in the angkor thom gate.Here are some tips for all the temples if you are going to visit alot of them,prepare a day or two to visit them all and make sure to pack alot of water! 1.First what we did was buy ticket in a goverment controlled establishment (you a have a choice of a 1day 2day or 3day pass for all the temples included) we got the 1day pass for $20 and visited 6 temples.If you are not that into walking i would suggest to just visit bayon and angkor or just split the temples in different days for there will be alot of walking! 2.SLEEVLESS,SHORTS,SLIPPERS,SHADES AND SCARFS ARE NOT ALLOWED although sandals may be considered.but most importantly make sure to be comfortable to enjoy ur visit. 3.Just to be sure dont forget to check the weather,temples dont have roofs and there are only few convered area so if it is gonna rain i suggest you bring you rain coats or umbrella.Ps. Guides are available in temples if you are into history and culture i suggests you get one as of now they are not the rip off kind of guys that will try to fool you they are nice and knowledgable guys that can share real great stories as you stroll in the temples,and they also know secret sculptures and images that you might pass by."

There is so much history and it is fascinating. You would miss so much without a guide. It is expensive by Cambodian standards but well worth it.

Angkor Thom is a very huge area that has a lot of temples like Bayon Temple, Phimenakas, Baphuon, Terraces of the Elephant and Terraces of the Leper King. There are other not-really famous temples inside Angkor Thom which you can explore as well, Some of the temples are within walking distant and adjacent to each other. But you need to know that from the entrance of a temple to the temple itself is like 1 to 2 kilometers away, so prepare yourself.I strongly suggest you to pay 1 day service for Tuk-tuk (I paid around USD 18 to the hotel to get 1 day Tuk-tuk ride and did the temples hopping). Better to save your energy to travel inside the temple and take a rest if you move to another temple. I thought I can move from Angkor Thom to Angkor Wat or to Preah Khan by foot, but glad I changed my mind and use Tuk-tuk instead. I saw some tourist walking from one temple to another, under the scorching sun of Cambodia - trust me, the heat is like a living hell on earth.

The ruins are on average side compared to what the other sites are but its the trees over growing things that will provide a unique look on things. If you are in The area check this one out. Your ride picks you up on the the other end so no backtracking is required."

We walked in and were not prepared for what was going to happen. We had a driver for the day taking us from one site to the next but we were on our own to visit the site. We were approached by a tour guide working there, his name was Yort Domdin, and he introduced himself and offered his service. His English was excellent and he started describing the history of the temple with a great sense of humor. He offered to show us more spots and explained what the history was behind this beautiful place. Yort took us around the temple in a way I would have never visited the site and was staging us in strategic poses for pictures. He was really entertaining and caught up the attention of other tourists nearby. He took us to the royal room, a dark place where the Buddha statue is standing and where you can pray and connect with this vibrant temple. Yort told us about the spirituality and the meaning of the design, while we were surrounded by smiling statues everywhere you'd look. The experience lasted two hours and I got the most amazing pictures, thanks to Yort and his hospitality. It was well worth his reasonable fee and I highly recommend his service and take the time to visit the temple with him!"

Reading a book/wikipedia page and visiting a museum in Angkor Wat is recommended beforehand as guides mostly are not very knowledgeable with very few exceptions. Most importantly noone should ever ride elephants there. This is the most cruel thing to do and you are literally murdering these animals if you do this. An elephant has died on one of these attractions recently. We visited in March and you could see how exhausted those animals were. I still regret I didn't go and try to stop them. If people cannot move their own fat up the mountain, then maybe they can do without that mountain."

Inside its walls, there are several more temples and other buildings built by the King. This place is rich with history and mystery that was never told to the modern world. The place seems a little run down and dusty as it has been abandoned for many hundreds of years, which was then found and restored by the French during the French Colonialism. Till this day, there are joint efforts by other countries to continually restore and reconstruct the whole ancient city. Be prepared to come here with a good pair of walking shoes, lots of drinking water and a cap, as you will need to do a lot of walking and it can be quite hot."

Unfortunately, most of the state heads on the entrance to the temple have been looted long ago and replaced mostly by reproductions. It is sad what people will do to great works of art to make money. I guess you have to realize how impoverished the cambodian people have been for a long time. Look out for the monkeys on the way in. They are very aggressive and like to steal your water. If you put it down on the ground then forget it. DO NOT try to fight them for the water, they will actually bite you--just let them have it. Inside the temple is very impressive. There are numerous great photo opportunities and it is fun to walk around and explore the inside passageways. I would go here early in the morning and catch Angkor Wat after lunch. The crowds do the opposite."

Once there we biked along the top of the wall from the main south gate (the agricultural gate) to the west gate (the ghost gate) before entering the city and heading to the Bayon Temple at the center. Once we were done exploring the temple, we then left the city through the east gate (the victory gate). I particularly liked our tour as the bicycling allowed us to see more of Angkor Thom than the typical tourists who would head straight to the Temple. If you're there early enough in the day, you can pay for an elephant ride. Apparently the elephants go for siesta after noon. I didn't notice any real shopping here, save that for Angkor Wat. I'd say this is still a must see if you are in Cambodia. The river around the 3 km square city is actually a moat built to protect the city. It's quite amazing to see. I will review Bayon Temple separately so the photos in this review are from the entrances and walls."

Once you are there you realise that this is not the most spectacular view you have seen this day. Don't get me wrong - the temple is spectacular but being on top of it let's you only watch the sun setting over the jungle - not really what you would expect if you have been at Angkor Wat for the sunrise :)"

The complex, built around 12th-13th is a city by itself with the Royal palace, the state temple, various other temples as well as the living quarters of priests from various ages and times. This city was built by Jayavarman VII, the great Hindu King who defeated and pushed back the Champa invaders, the Hindu rulers from what is now South Vietnam. This area was continuously inhabited and developed by Khmer kings for many generations. It was known as Yosodharapura earlier, from the previous Khmer king, Yasovarman when the empire was invaded by the Champa rulers defeating Yasovarman. After successfully pushing back the Champa invaders, Jayavarman VII built monuments on an extended area which had seen successive Khmer emperors such as Indravarman, Yasovarman build temples and cities in and around and sometimes overlapping the same area. Other temples such as Preah Ko (dedicated to Shiva, of the Hindu Trinity) built by Indravarman around 879, already existed in this area. Jayavarman VII built his beautiful state temple- Bayon with the grans 4 faced monuments within this complex as well as Ta Prohm and several other monuments.The royal palace was built of wood and has not survived the test of time. However, the ruins of temples which were made of stone, still remain. This area became known as Angkor Thom from around the 14th century. Angkor Thom means Large city - Angkor is a word derived from Sanskrit 'Nagara', meaning city and Thom is large. The city is surrounded by a massive wall and a moat. The ruins of the wall are still visible.There are several gates, the most impressive being the South gate where the enigmatic 4 faced Head (whether it is Brahma - the Hindu God of Creation or Buddha or Jayavarman VII himself is still debated) at the gate greets you, preceded by about 300 meter long figures on both sides of the entrance on the main road, enacting 'Samudramanthan' - Churning of the ocean - a Hindu mythology. The story goes thus - there was a long battle between the Gods (Devatas) and the demons (Asuras) regarding the control of the universe. The Gods, being afraid of the demons taking over, sought help from Vishnu, the preserver God of the Hindu trinity. He advised them to fetch the Amrita, the Nectar of immortality, lying at the depths of the ocean of milk. The ocean has to be churned to get the nectar and Vasuki, the snake God agreed to help. Vasuki is used as a rope by the Gods and the Asuras to churn the ocean. To be successful in churning the ocean, Vishnu advises the Gods to collaborate with the Asuras. During the churning, Apsaras (angels) and the Goddess Lakshmi also emerge along with the Amrita. Instead of sharing the Amrita with the demons, the Gods manage to consume it all and became immortal thwarting the advances by the Asuras to take over the universe.Lot of walking... parking is quite far from the ruins. Must carry water and umbrella if sunny. Good walking shoes are a must."

U ll see monkeys and a lot of them ready to pose and that too healthy ones thanks to all the tourists feeding them. Buddha faces carved on the walls, headless Buddha statues showing what various battles resulted in and a lot of history n mythology. Tip: walking shoes a must, lot of water n women... Please be well covered. A lot of temples do not allow sleeveless n short clothes."

The way my driver described Angkor Thom was everything from the Victory Gate, Bayon, Terrace of the Elephants and Leper King and much much more making it a large sprawling complex, and not really an individual temple. It has some amazing spots but is quite huge, I think you could spend a full day or two here and still not see it all, although i'm not sure you would want to."

The stone faces on the towers are one of the most intriguing and stunning features of Angkor Thom.

Our guide (we got one from our hotel, Borei Angkor), was really informative and was excellent in explaining the historical significance of the three main temples (we also went to Ta Phrom). According to our guide, a lot of people mistake the actual temple as Angkor Thom but the name of the temple is Bayon Temple and the entire compound itself is actually Angkor Thom. This is essentially a walled city with the beautiful Bayon Temple in it. Highly recommend that you put this on your list! It's also very crowded any time of the day but go earlier in the morning so it won't be too hot. There are also elephant rides from outside Angkor Thom for USD 20. These rides go from outside Angkor Thom into the compound. There is another elephant ride station inside right next to Bayon temple but that ride only goes around the the temple and is a shorter ride for also USD 20. Bayon Temple is not as big as Angkor Wat but no less majestic and it was a privilege to be able to see it in my lifetime."

There were four massive gates (the heights of which were determined by the room needed to accommodate an elephant and howdah with parasols). We entered the South Gate where there are well-restored statues of \"asuras\" (demons) on the right and on the left are serene-looking statues of the gods. Upon entering you can see four faces of Buddha around the Tower. The Eastern face represents light, the Western face represents mercy, the Southern face represents Sympathy and the Northern face represents Equanimity.In the middle of Angkor Thom is The Bayon, a three-tiered temple with a 45 meter tower topped by four gigantic carved heads. More than 50 smaller towers surround it, facing the points of the compass. The walls of The Bayon are covered with bas-relief. Outside they depict historical events; inside they depict gods and legends. There are scenes of everyday life: ox carts, fishing with nets, drinking, jugglers, chess players. In the land battle scenes there are warrior elephants and chariots. In the naval battle scenes there are fish, crocodiles and corpses floating.North of The Bayon is the Royal Palace, the Terrace of the Elephants, The Terrace of the Leper King, The Phimeanakas (meaning the Celestial or Flying Palace in Sanskrit). At one time lions guarded the four staircases leading to its central tower and they were covered in gold. Now that is all ruined.South of the Royal Palace is the Baphuon. It is reached by a 200 meter long causeway built on pillars. There was a lot of walking, and I won't lie: it's extremely hot & humid. Make sure to wear appropriate clothing and to drink a lot of water. You won't want to miss it as there's so much to see and interpret. I was fascinated with the combination of both Hindu & Buddhist aspects. We were very lucky to have an excellent guide, Mr. Than Sopheap from the Seven Candles Organization. He knew so much about the history and the sites we visited and really made it come alive for us."

I found this temple prettier - if that's the right word - than its big brother, Angkor Wat.Where the latter is bigger, more famous, to me more forbidding, Angkor Thom seemed to have a lighter touch somehow.I liked the avenue of faces over the moat fascinating. They were so Khmer, in fact one on the left hand side looked exactly like our guide. So much so that I had him stand next to it and copy its expression. On the right hand side were the angry looking faces.I wondered at the bas relief carving on every surface and way up high. How perfectly portrayed and hundreds of thousands of figures, all the faces different. And how long it must have taken goodness knows how many supremely artistic and talented people.Oh, and by the way, I definitely cannot bargain with people who are offering garments for sale at $4 each for well made singlets with attractive designs, from good fabric."

On the down side was that in high season, it was packed with tourists who were not really interested in seeing the site, bur more interested in taking selfies in doorways which made it difficult to navigate the site. There are a lot of rocks and rubble and it can be tricky to navigate. I preferred Ta Prohm which I visited next, however found Angkor Wat temple the best of all."

It\u2019s restored to some parts which provides a magnificent view. The moat is there, the demons and gods are there and the gate looks just as you want Angkor ruins to look. It is however crowded there, but you might see elephants riding through the gate with tourist, providing somewhat of an ancient feeling. The not restored North Gate of Angkor ThomThe bridge is in rather poor shape (from an archeological view \u2013 not traffic safety) with most of the statues gone or falling into pieces and the moat overgrown in parts. The gate itself has an authentic, rustic feeling to itself which is very nice and motivated a short stopPreah Palilay a miniature Ta Phrom located Northwest of the Leper King Terrace.A miniature alternative to the jungle temple of Ta Prohm if you want to see strangler trees creeping on buildings. However, only one tower and the biggest tree is cut of in the top. Few tourists find their way here so it is quite peaceful."

It is pretty spectacular and there is so much to see. If you are going here from Angkor Wat in a taxi or tuk Tuk then just a tip for you. The toilets are at the other end of the temple tour so get your driver to take you to the toilet before you let him leave as they are at least a kilometre away! You will probably spend more time here than you did at Angkor Wat as there are various temples to see and they are magnificent and in my mind more interesting especially if you are a keen photographer. Your ticket price for AW will include this area and it is just a couple of miles away from the main temple. Keep your ticket stub as you will be asked to show it on entering. It is very, very hot so take plenty of water and sun screen as you will be outdoors most of the time. A good tip is to go to the museum before visiting any of the temples as it gives you a good idea of the history."

The site has a lot to see and behold with plenty of opportunities for pictures and you are even joined by the wildlife (as I saw a few cheeky monkeys playing). The scale of the site which is believed to be over 800 years old demonstrates an age where royal was considered to be divine, a truly educational experience. To miss the crowds I would recommend visiting either in the early morning or late afternoon where you can explore the temple more freely. But I would also recommend a guide to supply further details about the history of this temple and bringing water, sun screen, a hat or umbrella if sunny or raining and of course a camera."

I actually preferred Angkor Thom to Angkor Wat - it's smaller and I just loved the faces carved into the 20m+ stone towers in the Bayon temple. Mesmerising. When entering from the south gate, you cross a bridge over the moat lined with stone sculptures each holding a length of Naga, the giant king cobra snake in a tug-of-war stance. Then you can walk through the temples of Bayon, Baphoun and Phimean Akas, not forgetting the Terraces of Elephants and the Leper King outside. The bas reliefs carved into the stone (laterite) walls show well preserved people and animals (fish, monkeys, elephants and dragon-like creatures). I could have walked round this all day.

You can get a great up close view of Prasat Sour Prat (the Acrobat temples). Its also close to the start of the forested area behind Prasat Sour Prat and is therefore relatively shady (some thing to be appreciated in very hot and sunny Siem Reap) .

This was the last great capital of the Khmer empire and it is surrounded by a 100m wide moat for protection against invaders. It is thought this city may have supported as many as 1million people in the surrounding region.The bas reliefs of the Bayon are decorated with 1.2km of carvings of more that 11000 figures engaging in everyday life in 12th century Cambodia. Each section of the wall shows people occupied with different tasks from fighting to providing the food for the warriors but the most amazing section is the 54 towers decorated with 216 enormous faces. It is interesting to note that when you add the numbers of individual features; the answer always come to 9; the lucky number we were told by our guide.We arrived late morning and because it was raining, the sun had no affect on the beauty of this site but still we found it a magnificent place to visit. Whether it is raining or not, I would suggest wearing good walking shoes to prevent slipping.You can get some amazing photos here. Your guide will know all the best spots and my tip is to give him your phone and let him click away; you'll be amazed at the resulting photos. Jenine Tracey"

This one offers little in the way of shade and umbrellas are awkward in many of the corridors so an earlier morning visit is recommended before it gets really hot. This temple does require you to go up stairs to see the majority. On the lower level however are beautiful murals showing daily life.

For those of you interested in the history of Cambodia and King Jayavarman VII (creator of Angkor Thom) I would highly recommend you pay additional for a private tour guide - ours Merlin was absolutely astounding, he was literally a walking encyclopaedia!You will also need to prepare for some form of transport inside as Angkor Thom covers a large area and I wouldn't recommend walking in the heat - taxis, tuk tuks and elephants are all available on the inside.Whilst it is possible to cover all of the temples in just one day, given the chance now I would have personally stayed in Siem Reap longer and perhaps covered just one of two of the temples each day. The architecture entices you completely! If you ever visit Cambodia do not miss out on such a phenomenal walk through history!"

Worth taking the time to read up about it before you go as you will understand more about the history and splendour. If you can, go with a tour guide, you will learn so much more and avoid some of the crowds.A true spectacle and definitely a 'must see' when you come to Cambodia. There are many street vendors and children selling postcards and souvenir stuff. Cambodia is a poor country and although the children do pester, a firm but polite 'no thanks' does work. They are trying to earn a living and you have to applaud them for that. They are happy!This is one of the most magical places in the world and I feel honoured to have had the chance to see it.

I entered the complex via the South Gate, which features a very impressive causeway lined with around 150 stone statues (gods on the left, demons on the right) leading up to an enormous stone archway. It all feels very \"Indiana Jones\". This temple is of course famous for its many carved stone faces - and quite imposing they are too. There are some superb photo opportunities on this site. Before you even enter the complex there are at least 2 very large buddhas on the perimeter. Sadly, this temple gets EXTREMELY busy with tourists, so try and get there as early as you can to avoid the crush. The Bayan is the best known centrepiece of this temple, with 54 towers and over 200 stone faces. Amazing. When you exit, you will walk past the Terrace of Elephants and the Terrace of Leper Kings. Be aware that elephant rides are offered as a means to approach the temple and look magnificent - but, my guide advised me to avoid using them as the elephants are apparently treated poorly and work very long hours. I took his advice."

You go through the gateway and follow a long pathway through jungle and come to the most amazingly huge site of temples. Many are not restored at all and have huge tumbled down areas and buildings overgrown with enormous trees. They look like a fantasy world. Far fewer people come to these temples and much of the time we were almost alone as we wandered round the stunningly carved temples. Many are huge and you feel wonder at the skills of the original builders. We chose to follow the arrows that pointed a way through the complex as you lose all sense of direction with the many high walls. It is quite magical.We experienced one huge PROBLEM!!!! we had not been warned by our driver [who waited for us at the gate] , nor could we see on the map of the temple area, that it is a square site, 2 kms square. It has a huge wall around the edge and a gate in the centre of each side - but noone warned us that the route with the arrows took us to a different exit! They look identical! It took over an hour to walk round the sides to the next gateway where our driver was.This is more interesting and stunning than Angkor Wat where everyone goes!"

This is also a good idea to avoid the too crowed Phnom Bakheng hill but we still could capture the whole Angkor reflecting from the water. Another advice is to cycle from the metropolis to Angkor Thom. Yes, biking on shady forest paths and beside huge temples on each corner of the four walls in Angkor Thom. With bike, you can go farer inside Angkor Thom than the usual walking paths other tourists go on. This is an easy way to get away from the crowds."

This is the stuff we see in the travel brochures and on TV documentaries. Putting aside Angkor Wat, this is the only other temple you need to visit if you are on a tight schedule. It has it all, elephants, monkeys, beggars and old buildings. Highly recommended. Visit anytime of the day, as there is plenty of shade here."

Was not very crowded when we were there just after lunchtime. Paid (an overprice) $30 for a tuk-tuk from sunrise to sunset and had time to see the following (with time left over, so if you're on a budget one day is enough and you don't have to rush to be able to see all of this): angkor wat (sunrise and the entire temple), banteay kdei, sras srang, pre rup, ta prom, ta keo, chau say thevoda, thommanom, preah khan, angkor thom, bayon and phnom bakheng (sunset, more of a view point). Doing it in that order also seemed like a smart plan as we were almost all alone everywhere (except sunrise and sunset and some people at ta prom). So don't listen to \"you can't do it in one day\", at least not if you are young and healthy and can climb the stairs quite easily. Don't forget to bring clothes that cover your knees and shoulders when walking in some part of the temples. I advise you to bring it though and take it off in between in order not to faint because of overheating..."

Some routes/circuits are 10-12km, but you obviously don't have to follow the recommended three day tours. Biking allowed us to observe daily life in the rural areas outside the temples as well as Siem Reap as a whole.Note 2: do not go ticketless! They will fine you. Grab tickets en route to the temple roads, on your right approx. 3km before arriving at a fork in the road. Angkor is to the left of the fork. Note 3: Money is changed in USD, Cambodia uses the reil as change, like cents. Note4: snack stands and beverages available near Angkor Wat - restaurants too, and vendors line up near other temples. Prices slightly elevated but it's not ridiculous inflation."

Don't be a sucker for the taxi driver who tries to sell you on the way there. It is better to land and let someone guide you and Tuk Tuk drivers are about 15 a day and more fun to get around. I stay at the Paris Angkor Hotel which is fabulous for the price of 25 or even 19 a night in the old part. Breakfast is included and the nice pool.

It really is a place that must be visited and experienced first-hand.At any time of year these ruins are not for anyone unsteady on their feet. There is a lot of tricky steps, stairs, cobbled pathways and low entrances. It is also extremely hot and sweaty work walking around these sites. Not for the faint-hearted, infirm or hung-over! A dress code of long sleeves and skirts/trousers is requested by the authorities out of respect as these are religious temples. This is also a good idea to prevent getting sunburnt, as can easily happen here. Take drinking water with you!The Cambodian government and World Heritage are doing an admirable job preserving, reconstructing and promoting these artifacts. The whole area and people is brimming with pride and a professional approach to allowing others to experience and witness these amazing, historic achievements.We found Angkhor Thom far better and more interesting than its more famous next door neighbour. Anghkor Wat has been heavily, obviously and rather poorly preserved and reconstructed. Angkhor Thom is being maintained and cared for with a greater view towards returning it to its original condition; not just preparing it for tourism. The former is enabling this, I know.All of the temples are fascinating. They provide wonderful photo opportunities (if you have the patience) and are something that will stay in you memory forever.I have great admiration for the Cambodian government who are controlling this site with care and consideration for its preservation, not just going for the fast, tourist buck as is usually the case. I hope that the local population genuinely benefit from the vast amounts of money that is being gained through tourism and not just through the small stalls and hawkers trying to sell trinkets."

We did not see another sole for an hour.

On this trek you feel like an explorer, coming on a destroyed temple on the corner and the East Gate is very rugged and used by locals only.Hint, Have a Tuk Tuk drop you off at the North gate and drop you off at the East Gate.Hate telling people about this as it is a special place, and we did not see any one doing this walk.

We went for sunrise, and even though it was cloudy and the sunrise didnt really happen, just to see the temple silohetted against the sky was magical and being there in the cool morning air was a beautiful way to start the day. We visited many temples during the course of the day, all different to each other, each one incredible. One thing we learnt was that a private vietanmese company have actually leased the land from Cambodia for 99 years, and we are in year 15, so all the entrance fee you pay goes into Vietnam rather than Cambodia which seems very sad, especially at $20USD for a day.Make sure that you wear shorts/skirt that reaches to your knees and a t shirt that covers your shoulders otherswise you will not be allowed in certain temples. This applies to both men and women, we saw both being refused entry into the Phimeanakas (Royal Palace )temple.

Thom temples tend to be smaller so by going to them first, you have the place to yourself! Use a professional guide to get the most of the experience."

The most famous of these temples is the Angkor Wat and usually people refer to the whole complex by just naming it \"Angkor Wat\". There are several temples and old towns in this region (which spans up to 400 square km-thats a lot!) and its probably impossible to visit all of them if you are planning to spend only 3 days. We had only 3 days and we managed to cover the basic and most known sites/temples but unfortunately we didnt get the chance to see the sun rising and sunset views because of cloudy weather. Planning your visit at this temples can be done by internet before you arrive or on the spot (usually hotels can arrange a tour for you). You can either hire a driver (motorcycle chariot- its fun) or you can hire bicycles and cycle all the way to the temples (thats a lot of cycling though..). We hired a driver and he was available for the whole day, he did not follow us into the temples but waited for us to finish our tour and then drove us to the next temple etc. First day we arrived we did the Vespa tour (evening) which was really fun, the guide took us around Siem Reap and we had a walk into the night market were we ate some local BBQ and had a try on some insects and \"weird\" stuff. The guide (very good english) was really friendly and gave us a lot of info about the local and the way the live. Second day we booked a driver and we did the so called \"small circuit\" but you can amend the tour and do whatever you want as the day goes on. So in one day we managed to visit the Angkor Wat Temple and then we went to the Ta Prohm temple (Tomb Raider movie - trees) - spend a few hours in each of them. We also managed to go to Angkor Thom in the same day. Angkor Thom was a great city and its huge! The city walls are 3km x 3km (you can cycle the perimeter of the wall = 12km) and there are four amazing entrances (N, S, E, W). The highlights of Angkor Thom are located at the centre, where the Bayon temple is (temple with faces). A few meters away is the Baphuon temple were you can go up the main structure and have amazing views. In the same vicinity there are the terrace of Lepperds King and terrace of Elephants (small structures that can be viewed by walking by) and a market where you can get tourist stuff like souvenirs etc (you can bargain and you should :) )The last day we asked the driver to take us in some of the temples that are located in the \"big circuit\" and just drive us through the rest of the circuit. It was worth it! We visited the Banteay Kdei and Preah Khan only because we didnt have much time but they were definitely worth it. Overall we had a great time, walked a lot and took hundreds of photos!Enjoy"

This continued until we disembarked at the end of the ride. It was a bit embarrassing but the ride made it worth while. Because we were on an elephant the monkeys were not afraid of us so we got closeup with them as well and getting great views especially of the amazing boats as we crossed the bridge to Bayon. The temple is amazing, take breakfast and enjoy a seat somewhere inside but remember to take away your rubbish. Treat Bayon like any other religious site, dress appropriately and be respectful, especially around sites being actively used for worship. This is a big area arrange to meet your tuktuk driver at a particular place (otherwise you may not find him) I suggested the big old tree beside the road near the end of the elephant walk. If you don't arrange a meeting spot the driver will be with all the other drivers which is fine in June and July when there are few tourists so few tuktuks but other times of the year it can be impossible to find anyone. Speaking of Tuktuk driver try Mr Pahna he is the best in the business. Phone him on +855 1286 45 81 or 855 975085708 e.mail and facebook panhachhouk@yahoo.com and arrange him to pick you up from the airport. If you do get him as your driver ask him to take you to the local market for a tour, well worth a look and you can get real gems stones there. Beware of young people trying to get you to donate to their school fees, maybe not what you expect. If you want to help Cambodians try this .... On your way into Cambodia you are unlikely to have your full quota of kgs of luggage. Most airlines offer 30kgs but most people take nearly empty suitcases into the country and fill them while they are there. Don\u2019t take a half empty suitcase into Cambodia, fill it up with children\u2019s books, educational toys (no battery operated toys), toothbrushes, soap, shoes, technology items and other useful things. The items don\u2019t need to be new, just in good working condition. Please don\u2019t take lollies or sugary stuff and don\u2019t offer religious items, Cambodians have a diversity of religions available to them, let them choose. You can ask your hotel to distribute the items or take them to the Children\u2019s Sanctuary."

The tour was meant to finish watching the sun set, however due to the afternoon storm we missed this part, but that didn't take anything away from the day. It's extremely hot and there are thousands of stairs so take plenty of water and wear a hat. The stairs are more like ladders so good comfortable shoes are a must. At the start of the tour you purchase a temple pass that gets you into all the temples. Don't lose it and be prepared for them to take your picture. The pass is $20usd.

I fondly remember our trip to Siem Reap and the amazing tour of Angkor with Phanna. We appreciated his knowledge and passion of his country and his pride of showing the treasure of Angkor Wat to visitors. We should all love what we do and the country we live as much as Phanna. This is remarkable given the history and difficulties that Cambodia has endured. He was the first guide we experienced in SE Asia and I think about our time to this day. He guided us around the grounds of Angkor skillfully, avoiding the bus crowds. At mid-day we paused in the shade and he told us the stories that we were about to see on the walls of the next temple. Phanna had water and cold towels at the ready when we returned to the car after our visits to various temples. I have stayed in touch with Phanna since our visit. We visited the floating village. We saw so much in just the 3 days we were in Siem Reap, and Phanna wanted to tailor the tour to you. He wanted to know you, and what you wanted to see, offering his suggestions. He was relieved when we passed on Angkor at sunrise, but he did provide a great view for photos of the sunset. I have referred family and friends to him when they have visited Siem Reap. He is knowledgeable, thoughtful, kind and has a great sense of humour. I would highly recommend Phanna if you want an experience you will carry with you forever. This review is 9 years overdue, but it should demonstrate the impression he made. I hope to see my friend some time in future. I would welcome a return trip to Siem Reap to visit with him again."

The most significant part of the complex is Bayon Temple, with its massive carved heads.You enter the walled city via one of two causeways lined on each side by giant carved mythical beings called devas and asuras. The statues depict the chuning of the mikly sea myth which is depicted in a fine carve base relief within the Angkor Wat.Also within the 'city' is Ta Prohm temple made famous by the Lara Croft movie, with its giant trees whose roots wind their way over walls to create the most errie of sights. There is much more to be found if you have the time and inclination to explore. Overall the entire Angkor Archeoligical site is certainly one of the wonders of the world and well worth several visits."

Baphoun has many levels and climbing the stairs to the levels are a workout. The Terrace of the Elephants is impressive. Our guide shared that the King had 60,000 elephants during his kingdom. The elephants would battle in the open area and kill the water buffalo as the king and spectators watched. The many stone structures in front of the terrace is where the acrobats would perform for the king. It must have been an amazing sight during the kingdom."

Much larger that Angkor Wat and perfect for grazing around the historic ruins. Loads of temples. Most have been Buddaized, but you can still get a feel for the Hindu past. Here there is a great variety of near complete temples and decaying ruins. The vastness allows you to roam around without a guide or guidebook and make your own discoveries. For literally a couple dollars you can hire a tuk tuk for a few hours or the day. In our case we spent about five hours in the complex. I highly recommend doing this. Tuk tuk drivers know where the most common sites are. You can use that as a starting point and return to your driver once you're ready to move on. Our diver was great and we give him a nice tip for the great service and advice. Angkor Wat is the main draw to Siep Reap, but don't miss this part of the experience."

They also don't allow heavily pregnant women in and you should know that the climb is daunting and very steep. There are only a limited number of people allowed to the top each day and they don't know how long it will still be possible to allow public access before the ancient structure starts to crumble beneath the burden. We were among the lucky ones who got to go to the top. The view is spectacular.put a bottle of water in the freezer the night before, it will be melted by the time you are inside. You will spend a lot of time walking and climbing so dress comfortably. This complex is not as well preserved as Ankor Wat in its entirety but parts of it is and it is all definitely worth seeing. Its also worth taking an official guide with you to tell you about what you are seeing and where you are. We would never have known that the forests we were wandering through was once the royal palace or that the ponds were their swimming pools. You should also be aware that you need to buy a pass from the registered office to visit any of the temples around Siem Reap. Ask your hotel for more details. Should be $20 per day or $40 for 3 days."

My favourite feature of Angkor Thom is Bayon (imagine the 4 faced giant Angelina Jolie was fighting over, just numerous of them). The 54 Gods and Demons lining the bridge over the moat is equally impressive. And then, there's the Terrace of the Elephants. Unmissable!"

It was thus not too crowded and we were able to climb and visit at leisure. Not stroller friendly given lots of large and uneven stones. Our kids loved it. What we saw as historical vestiges they saw as a huge playground!!! Afterwards we did a tour on an elephant, again a big hit w the kids but also offered a good and different perspective on the temple. Would highly recommend!!"

History says that it was constructed as a Hindu temple but subsequently converted to a Buddhist temple. But religion is not important here. The beautiful artwork that adorns the structure , the design of the structure itself , its surrounding , the complex internal geography . . . . All these contribute to the overall image of Angkor Thom. The moment one approaches the site and the structure looms in the horizon , one is awe-struck by its size and elegance. This feeling of awe remains till the visit is complete. It needs many difficult stairs to be climbed and many corridors , crevices , temples to be seen. If you want to learn while seeing , take a guide."

For me, about four sufficed, and I had run out of stamina by the end. The day was right up with Taj Mahal and Macchu Picchu for interest, and ahead of Borobudur and Pagan.

Granted, the elephant rides and the hawkers detract from the natural beauty of the place, but don't let them stop you from including Angkor Thom on your tour of Angkor Wat and the surrounding region."

We crossed a stone bridge over the wide moat and couldn't get enough of the 154 statues that guard the gate; demons on the left and gods on the right; and the gate itself is crowned by an immense stone face gazing just above our heads into the distance. The gate opening is only wide enough for certain vehicles, mostly tuc-tucs and small passenger vans. We had to leave our motor coach behind. I really wish I had several days to explore this city, but was fortunate to be able to spend some quality time at the South Gate and at the Bayon.Don't miss this World Heritage Site.

Elephants mean strength in both the Hindu and Buddhist faiths. Unfortunately, during the Khmer Rouge reign, many of the elephants were killed for ivory or maimed by land mines. The fortunate ones were able to flee to the Surin area of Thailand where they live today. Therefore, the culture goes on but not in its original home."

While Angkor Wat gets the spotlight (and the crowds) Angkor Thom has so much more. Just the entry gates are spectacular, with their huge Buddha heads gazing serenely off to the distant horizon, and there are 4 of those, the popular South and North gates, but also the much quieter East and West Elephant gates which are really worth a visit for some quiet jungle contemplation. Then of course there is the Bayon Temple, which is situated right in the centre of Angkor Thom. I believe there were originally 216 (Exact numbers are not my thing) huge stone faces of Buddha in the upper gallery of the Bayon, not all remain but they are a truly spectacular sight to see, especially just after sunrise or sunset when the side lighting really brings out the serenely smiling features.There is so much more to see at Angkor Thom, the Baphuon temple with the spectacular views and huge reclining buddha, the Elephant terrace with the huge bas relief carvings, and the terrace of the leper King with the hidden carvings that were buried for hundreds of years when the building was modified and a second wall built in front, effectively preserving the carvings from decay and pillage (from tomb raiders). There are also many smaller hidden temples in Angkor Thom where you can get away from the crowds that descend on the place after 9am (nearly 4 million visitors a year!) and enjoy some peace and contemplate the ancient culture that built these intricate and vast works of art.Angkor Thom is worth a few days of exploring, and its worth getting up early, really early, (4.30am) to beat the crowds. You won't regret it."

This temple is famous for its many faces (216), all in sets of four, which are a mixture of Buddhism and Hinduism. Though the temple was built as the last state temple in Angkor as a Mahayana Buddhist shrine, some scholars believe that the shrine may be paying more homage to the founding/creating King Jayavarman VII than Buddha himself, as there seems to be a keen resemblance between the 216 faces and the god-like king with the name meaning victorious warrior. Angkor Thom, much like the King's ousting of the Chams, stands as a reminder of the monumental size and power of the Khmer Empire, the largest pre-industrial urban center in the world from the 11th-13th century.If you'd like to do more than just ooh and ah over this fantastic walled city, be sure to get a guide.

One does not want to take away from mystery and wonder of these most famous of ruins ruins but they tend to be similar and after a while they tend to look very similar. Don't bank on spending too much time wondering around the ruins in the middle of the day as this place can get VERY hot and uncomfortable. Take lot of Fluids and an Umbrella for shade!!"

One piece of advice is if possible go during off peak season for easy photography. Peak season is from Nov to february. The temple will be packed with tourists and you will have to queue up to take photos. Sometimes the queue will be from 30 to 60 minutes. Nevetheless, this is a must see in Cambodia. where else can you see another one like this? Get a tourist guide to explain as it will be meaningful."

To get there you cross a fantastic bridge which is lined with traditional naga statues which is seen in Angkor Wat. I would recommend stopping for a photo as it's very ornate and pretty. Angkor Thom is very tall and a lot more of a real feel to it as it's not as busy as Angkor Wat and feels more like it's just been discovered and that it's more 'wild', there were even a few monkeys going about! There are many levels which you can climb up, I wouldn't recommend the ascent if you aren't very mobile or struggle with stairs as there are quite a few and you need to watch where you put your feet in a few places. There is a distinctive difference between here and Angkor Wat which is very noticable. Angkor Wat is primarily a buddhist complex whereas Angkor Thom has a strong influence of Hinduism and there are lots of 4D faces. Lots of good photo opportunities at the top for those who want to get creative with camera angles aswell! Excellent place."

The south gate of the complex has two long rows of statues depicting \"churning the ocean of milk\". Then there are 54 towers with smiling faces of the manifestations of Buddha (according to Mahayana Buddhist concept, I believe). The complex is vast and includes many different temples, some of Hindu style, several terraces some of which are called \"Terrace of the Leper king\", \"Terrace of the elephants\". There are legends behind all these structures and it would be helpful to have a guide who knows this stuff inside out and rattles out every detail. I personally do not remember all what he said, but at the time a story behind the carvings really helped me. There was a wall with depictions of events of daily life of the people, which I found quite interesting. It was also note worthy that some statues (even one of the manifestations of demon) were decorated with a bright yellow/orange robe as a form of veneration. There are many stairs to climb if you are ambitious, and it would be helpful to have a hat/umbrella, sunscreen and a lot of water. It is really worth it to take your time and see all you can manage to see. I strongly recommend a guide to make the best out of the visit.There are some elephant rides in the vicinity as well, if that attracts you.I simply loved the carvings and the legends in this complex."

The Terrace of the Leper King and the Elephant Terrace also have amazing carvings with elephants, Gods and Demons galore. Two of the gates to Angkor Thom have causeways that are lined with statues of Gods on one side and Demons on the other - truly stunning to see and to walk along and pass through the gates. Many of these statues are in advanced stages of decay, but some have been restored. This is a must visit archeological site if visiting the area of Siem Reap.

Our tuk tuk driver dropped us at Bayon and the crowds were not there. Many may have been put off by the afternoon downpour but that didnt deter us. What a huge temple precinct . So many areas to explore within Angkor Thom. All of which were different . The 54 towers with 216 heads at Bayon, 3000000 pieces of stone replaced at Baphoun, the wide open forest areas and the pools. It was different to AngkorWat in a more adventorous way as climbing and navigating were part of the experience. Great photo opportunities and really hpurs could be spent here."

Angkor Thom actually refers to an extensive area which includes the spectacular temples of the Bayon, the Baphuon, Phimeneakas, the Temple of the Leper King and the Elephant Terrace among others. Try to get a good guide and brush up on the history of these structures to fully appreciate. It's just awesome to imagine those temples in the past like Baphuon with its bronze roofs and Phimeneakas with its golden tops. Also, I recommend the gondola ride on the angkor thom moat. It's very relaxing to float along the manmade canal that used to hold crocodiles."

This is a sprawling and beautiful ancient structure with a strong Hindu influence. Its unique feature is numerous towers honoring the Hindu pantheon, making for great photo ops. Its reconstruction is not as far along as Angkor Wat, which provides an interesting window into this challenging process. My advice for this area is similar to what I would say for all the temple areas: dress for the intense weather, wear comfortable shoes, and hire a guide. Your clothing does not have to reflect the more modest standards of Angkor Wat."

It is really amazing to see the trees growing over this temple, it's really something to see. It is not spread out like many of the other temples, it's more contained and has lots of pokey little corridors and doorways. Because of this, when it is crowded it's much harder to make your way through easily because of all the tourists. My suggestion is to make sure you go here on a week day when there are less people so you can enjoy it more. There is an influx of tourists from Vietnam and other nearby countries on weekend visits, so there are more people visiting on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. If you visit on a Monday to Thursday, you are more likely to have a relaxed visit, and less likely to be pushed and shoved by the crowds."

This is the gateway to the most advanced civilization at its time featuring a Four-faced Buddha at its peak. You might recognize this as one of the scenes in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.The walkway back in time. Feeling eerily ancient as I walked into Angkor Thom via the South Gate. Lining the causeway leading up to the gates of Angkor Thom are Deva statues holding back a Naga Raja. These devas protect the path into the ancient Khmer city, surrounded by a moat. All entrances on each axis leads directly to Bayon at the centre of Angkor Thom. I guess as they say in Khmer, \u201call roads lead to Bayon.\u201dAngkor Thom\u2019s walled city contains many temples to visit. Bayon at the centre, the Terrace of the Elephants, The Leper King\u2019s, the Royal Palace. You\u2019ll gonna need lots of time for that.All Khmer roads lead to Bayon. That is true within the capital city of the Khmer Empire, Angkor Thom and at its heart is Bayon. The last temple to be built in Angkor before the fall of the Khmer empire, its distinctive characteristics is the four-sided stone faces adorning the towers. The feeling I get when I venture into the temple compound is like entering a maze city. It\u2019s small and compact within, and the twist and turns do make you feel like Indiana Jones excavating your next adventure.Ascending to its summit, I found that Bayon seem compact, claustrophobic even. It doesn\u2019t have the wide spaces such as Angkor Wat, and it\u2019s also a smaller temple compared to its more famed brethren. But there are more hidden corners, unknown pathways, dark hallways that make the experience somewhat more thrilling. Almost as if you\u2019re exploring a road less travelled."

The ruins were built in the 12th century, so that age itself made them interesting. The highlight for us was Ta Prohm, known as the \"Kingdom of Trees\" for the way huge trees have intertwined with the temple stones.

However, you might be approached by non official guides, that will basically just string you along, and at the end, ask for a donation to the teachers teaching them English, and after that, ask for a donation to themselves for guiding you around.

One stood astonished in front of all these temples and wished that you could just have a glimpse of the royal monarchy who lived here. If you are not afraid of heights, make time to climb all the steps. Just be careful because the steps are very narrow and steep. Wear good walking shoes.

The Bayon and the gates of Angkor Thom certainly produces some of the most recognisable images among ancient ruins. The place is big and contains a number of sites worth looking at, so give yourself plenty of time when visiting. I visited in April, and be warned, it is hot at that time of the year, so take plenty of water. However, despite it being a must-see, I'm not giving it a top rate. This is because, like Angkor Wat, for a site of such international importance and one of the major tourist attractions in the world, the place is poorly managed. It is a dismay to see ramshackle shacks selling tacky goods within the compound, and to have children constantly pestering you to buy things at inflated prices. It detracts from the experience. Those who manage this place should at least give the visitors a proper place to eat and rest (at least they built one outside Angkor Wat) instead of shacks, with good souvenir shops and properly licensed vendors."

Visit here to see a detailed review of this destination - http://BelovedAtmosphere.com/Angkor-Thom-Cambodia. Not only are the temples massive and intricately crafted, but each is unique. I highly recommend hiring a local guide to help you navigate Angkor, since they know the landscape, and can best decide how to escort you through the park. It can be extremely busy at times, so a good guide will help you avoid the crowds by taking you to each temple during \"low\" times of traffic. Furthermore, if you want a genuine feel for the landmarks and stories related to each temple, a guide is your best bet. Angkor Thom has a very cool story. Interestingly, we saw the most saffron-robed Buddhist monks while touring this wat."

It was Sunday and the usual bike rental place that the tour uses was closed so we went to another one in Siem Reap. The ride to the temples was fine, though traffic in Siem Reap is crazy. Only cars seem to obey any traffic rules (such as driving on the proper side of the road) and so the ride was \"interesting\". Just when I was feeling good about being on the shoulder a motorbike was headed directly for me. Most of the ride there was fun and I figured it would make for a good story. We saw wild monkeys on the road and free range pigs. The bikes were then left in the care of people the guide knew. The entrance into Angkor Thom was beautiful with the long rows of statues (soldiers?) along either side. I believe that several temples are considered to be part of Angkor Thom but I am not sure. The temples were within walking distance from one another and I'm sure we only saw a small part of each. The Banyon Temple with the 200 faces of Avolokitesvara was quite amazing... as was the Elephant Terrace that came next. We were brought back to our hotel to rest up to see Angkor Wat in the late afternoon. After Angkor Wat we had to pick up the bikes and ride them back to the bike rental place. This ride took well over an hour and it became dark in the middle of the ride. If traffic was bad in the morning it was horrendous at rush hour. At one point we lost the guide amidst all the vehicles. We just kept going straight and eventually found him waiting for us. This ride was more thrilling than any amusement ride because it had the element of truly getting yourself killed (we had no lights on the bikes). If you ride steadily (just the way they teach you to cross streets there) then the vehicle drivers will adjust to you. Only at one point when we had to cross a particularly crazy intersection did I get off my bike and put my hand up to stop traffic so we could cross safely. In the end it made for a great story!"

The entrance to this site was extremely busy (10am) so we ditched our taxi driver before the bridge and headed over by foot. The bridge itself is spectacular with large statues either side the whole way over the moat. The gate is impressive with the faces cut in to the rock. This was my favourite temple, so many carvings depicting wars, nature and various day to day and community activities from ancient times past. Truly magical and such an amazing structure that the Cambodians can be so proud of. It was exceptional humid and the sun blazing down is immense. This was my first temple which might explain why it was my favourie. I swear I lost a stone in weight walking which is why I sped round later temples as I needed the a/c of the car.

The elephant will greet you at the South Gate of Angkor Thom and will transport you to the Bayon temple in a regal style. The price per person: USD20. Payment cash on the spot.Check out the little tips pocket on the back of his shirt. :)Tip to the elephant: Do buy a pineapple as a treat for the lovely elephant :) (sold on the spot)."

There are too many things to see in a day unless you are an Olympic athlete and even then you'll only see it on photos and video after the event. Its probably better to do Bayan, the biggest temple, in several hours because its HUGE then one or more smaller temples and come back a second day to finish. The 3-day pass costs the same as the 2-day pass and maybe that's why. The temples are amazing and some parts are better than Angkor Wat proper."

The main temple here is Bayan Temple, or the temple of smiles. It is an incredible place and makes you feel happy because each tower welcomes visitors with four smiling Buddha faces. the south gate entrance is stunning and greets visitors with over twenty statues on either side of the bridge. The Gods are on the left and the demons on the right. Many of the heads of these statues were stolen during the war, but some originals remain. The true beauty lies behind the walls of Bayon Temple. The beautiful structure and the carved Buddha smiling faces is gorgeous. Most of the spectacular happy carvings at Bayon Temple remain. There are 37 towers with four smiling faces pointing in each direction. That is a total of 148 happy faces plus two from us gives a grand total of 150 smiles at Bayon Temple.  There was an Asian elephant in front of the temple and we walked past it to visit the Terrace of Elephants. This was another temple on the Angkor Thom complex that was built in the 12th century and dedicated to the power and love of elephants. Elephants are truly the most incredible creatures and they were the work trucks back when the temples were being built. They used the elephants to carry the stone to make the temples.  Bayon Temple was our guide's favorite temple in the Angkor complex. He was proud and joyous to share his passion about this spot and it showed with the beaming smile on his face. There is a happiness and serenity here, along with a love of elephants that also made this our favorite temple we visited during our tour. Spend time here and you will leave Happy."

The guide practically ignored us and made it very clear we were some kind of nuisance in his life! he would drop us off at sites and say where and when to be collected with no other information about the amazing sites we were about to see. We have now watched many programmes since and we could have discovered so much more than we did. Highly recommend this place for a once in a life time must do....we will certainly be going back.

This is the largest of these four sites and you really need a full day to see everything. There are five huge gates with carved faces (start with the Victory Gate and take a short climb up and along the wall to the little visited East gate). The highlight is the Bayon which originally consisted of hundreds of giant smiling stone faces; four faces being carved into each side of 50 stupas or towers. Here there is access to all three tiers and you can get some creative photos from the third tier especially early in the morning. There are some interesting bas reliefs depicting Kyhmer history. Tours also focus on the the Elephant and the Leper Terraces (best carvings are to be found on the internal walls of the latter - fabulous carvings deities, dancers, snakes etc). Behind these there is the three tiered royal enclosures (Phimeanakas) with some broken elephant and lion guardians. The large Baphuon temple has some lovely carvings of scenes of Angkor daily life on west side of first tier. Hire a guide to ensure you get the best out of the history and design \u2013 you can\u2019t possibly get this from a guidebook. There are no restroom facilities on the Angkor Thom main site but there are a couple in the general area (free entry included in the Angkor Archaeological site ticket but you may struggle to find without a guide).

You hear so many horror stories of animals being mistreated for tourism. And I was very aware of this whilst on my 6 month travels, this was the only case I was witness to. As I was standing beside the group of elephants that walk people to the temples, an elephant was making sad whimpering noises, it was clearly unhappy. The guy on top ignored it whilst playing on his phone and to my complete horror, another guy approached the elephant and punched it on the lip and stood on its trunk. The elephant didn't react and continued to make whimpering elephant noises whilst playing with a leaf. So sad, and no wonder animals act out. If only I could have gotten away with the same actions to the guys, let's hope karma is real.I was travelling solo as part of an adventure group. Our day started with an early rise to watch the sun come up over Angkor Wat. As beautiful as this sounds, be warned that hundreds of people and tour groups have the same idea. You will need to arrive at least an hour to two before the sunrises in order to get a good spot by the pond that doesn't involve cameras and selfie sticks being shoved in your view. What really disappointed me was how people watched the whole thing through a screen and took an unnecessary amount of photographs, no appreciation at all. And people will push you out of the way to get that picture! (Also, a bit of a mission finding the loo at this particular point, you will need some loose change or a dollar when you do find it)Kids will pester you to buy postcards and keychains but don't buy anything as they will honestly follow you everywhere and you will have a group of them since you bought off another. The temples themselves are really cool but again go early to avoid the masses, we done the faces temple first, the tomb raider/tree temple 2nd and finally Angkor Wat... In this order it was relatively quiet. It would have been a great experience if it wasn\u2019t for people\u2026 or if everyone there was a Buddha."

We were with a tour and, therefore, were directed to a special ticket area, thus avoiding long lines. Your picture is taken for placement on the ticket (good for both Ankor Wat and Ankor Thom), which is frequently checked. If you are not utilizing a guide guide then reading up prior to visiting is a must. Be prepared, there is plenty of walking and steps to climb. Proper footwear and comfortable clothing is a must. Drinking water in the heat is a necessity. The history, size, construction of the temples is totally amazing."

Depending on when you visit certain areas get really busy and it was pretty hot so having the benefit of a driver with aircon vehicle made getting around easy and in comfort. It truly is an amazing site and certainly one of those 'must visit' places in Cambodia. One thing to bear in mind there are no restroom facilities actually on the main site, there are a couple in the general area, which we would have never found if we didn't have our guide and driver. The site is vast and it really is worth hiring a guide."

The harder you look for them the more you discover. We had the pleasure of being with a knowledgeable guide (just two of us and him) who told us all about the stories carved in the walls. Completely fascinating. It is a large temple so plenty to see. If you are in to temples, them this is worth a visit. The only down side for us was that there were several large tour groups from one nationality, who were very noisy, shouting and singing and clapping. I just wish they could have been more respectful to both the location and other tourists."

There are many things to see, but I loved the faces on one of the structures. If you need to cool down, there is a long raised walkway to an actual temple (which requires you to be covered to the knees and full shoulder coverage) that gets a nice breeze. Walking between the attractions here gets very tiring, so communicate with your tuk tuk driver. As noted, if you want to go into the ancient temple on these grounds, you must dress properly. We saw half a dozen in tank tops get turned away as we walked up. This temple is basically a very steep climb up, a nice view, a small exploration, and a steep climb down. There are secure bars to either side, which are handy for helping you to pull yourself up if you get tired (some people clearly did) and my muscles felt it the next day. Like many of the Wats here, it gets extremely busy. My hotel recommended going during lunch time, but you would have to bring your own food, perhaps, because we were told that the restaurants usually close after 2 or 3 o'clock."

This , in the 12 th century, was established by King Jayavarman, and this great attraction is spread over 9 kms. At the center of the City, stands the State Temple of Jayavarman, The Bayon, which is surrounded by more than 20 towers. While entering , one can find the mutillated statues of Devas on one side, and Asuras on the other. Each of the group is holding a serpent in its hand, and it is said to be the \" Samudra Manthan\" , the churning of the Ocean. Angkor Thom lies on the West Bank of Siem Reap River. There are gates at all the cardinal points, and the South Gate is the entering point for all the tourists. Many intricate sculptures are depicted on the wall. The churning of the ocean, the historical sea battle between the good Khmer and the bad Cham of Vietnam, who were experts in sea battle. There are many four faced statues, which may represent Bodhisattva, which we may call Brahma. I definitely want to mention here about one Angkor Tour Guide Service, and one Mr. Sok Chea, who was our wonderful tour guide. Always with a smiling face, always trying to be helpful, his presence and guidance, made our stay in Cambodia great!"

I encourage you not to buy stuff from child seller. you can buy 1 day pass ticket for 20 USD, they will check your ticket each time you want to enter the major temple. your face will be printed on the ticket so the ticket is not transferable.

The only thing that prevented me from giving five stars was the overwhelming crowds. There are areas where it is bumper-to-bumper people; making it very tough to get a good photo, let alone walk. The administrative organization that runs this place needs to hire someone (Disney?) to help deal with crowd control. I'd have been happy to pay more (a one day pass is $20) to get a little more exclusivity. Machu Picchu limits visitor numbers. Maybe they should do the same here.

            "review": "Fascinating and Beautiful City. Angkor Thom held true to its' name as being the Great City - the last and most enduring capital of the Khmer Empire. Angkor Thom was established in the late 12th century or early 13th century as the capital of Jayavarman VII's empire. Angkor Thom was a fortified city that covers an area of 10 square kilometers. The entire area was surrounded by a wall in the shape of a large square with four gateways and wide moats. The Bayon Temple (perhaps my favorite temple we visited while in Siem Reap) lies in the middle of the Great City.Prior to making it to the Bayon Temple, we made a quick stop to admire the Terrace of the Elephants and the Terrace of the Leper Kings within the Angkor Thom. These terraces were once the venue for public ceremonies and parades. The palace of the King at the time was immediately across from the Terrace of Elephants, but the structure of the palace no longer exists. Practically across from the Terraces was the Baphuon, Royal Enclosure and Phimeanaka.The Bayon Temple (the temple with all of the faces), located in the center of Angkor Thom, was built during the same time period as the Elephant Terraces, and is one of the most popular and compelling.As we exited Angkor Thom, we passed through one of the five entry/exit gates. I believe it was the south gate. The architecture of the gate was impressive and stunning. Through the gate was a causeway that extended approximately 50 meters across a moat. On either side of the causeway were railings decorated with 54 stone figures on each side. One side was a series a 54 stone asuras (demon gods) statues, and the other side was a series of 54 devas (guardian gods). Each side was holding part of a giant naga (serpent) and pulling it in opposite directions. According to the Hindu myth, the body of the snake is wrapped around the central mountain, Mt. Meru, with the asuras and devas pulling on its' tail in opposite direction. As the asuras and devas continued to pull on the snake in opposing directions, the ocean began to churn, and, as the alternating continued, the ocean was \"milked\" and the earth and cosmos were formed anew. Mt. Meru is located in Tanzania in close proximity to Mt. Kilimanjaro that Michael and I saw often during our climb to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro at 19,345 ft the year prior. It is believed that the central Mr. Meru corresponds to the Bayon temple, since the Bayon temple is located in the dead center of the site.Some of the heads of the demons and gods along the railway had been restored, which was noticeable because they were white. Overtime, the white turns black like the original structure and it will be difficult to notice which is new and which is original. Parts of the statues' noses or ears or other parts were purposely broken off to make them resemble their older counterparts once the white stone turns black."

Just be polite and firm if you don't actually want to buy anything.Be aware that it is extremely hot at Angkor Thom and there's not much in the way of shade unless you're actually inside the main building. There are also monkeys on the site, so watch out for them as well. I didn't hire a guide, because I tend to spend forty minutes doing a drawing when I visit temples, but they are available, and I heard a myriad languages being spoken, so pretty much everyone should be able to find a guide who speaks their tongue.Absolutely worth the visit."

The travel agent's tour guide during our 5D4N in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, Mr Yusoff Akob was very friendly. He speaks our mother toungue (Malay) apart from English. Took us to the right places of interest with no fuss. Although the 7 hr trip from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap by van on not-so-good road (dust road under construction for about 200km of total 350km) was tiring, but was an opportunity to see the countryside with several stops. Unless visitors wish to see the the countryside, it is advisible to fly from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap or vice versa. Anyway, the trip to Cambodia was wonderful. The people are friendly.

The back of the elephant drivers' shirts has a little pocket for tips , so take a couple bucks for that. You can also buy pineapples to feed the elephants and the kids enjoyed that almost as much as the actual ride.This temple was the best suited for letting the kids lead us around wherever they wanted to go. It's enough like a maze that they had a blast, and there are plenty of places you can climb up that are just adventurous enough to make mom nervous and dad laugh.Pack your own water, because it wasn't available for purchase around the first three sets of ruins we saw at this site, and we were dying for a drop of water by the time we found the folks selling it.Definitely make time for this one-it was the best."

Thanks to Mara Long (our licensed tour guide), he slipped us into some parts we wouldn\u2019t have known of climbing or going into. I could only imagine what it must have been like for the ancients to have stepped into this architectural and artistic marvel."

Very cool, especially the many faceted head on top of the Victory Gate. Bayon was very cool, as was Baphuon (a little further in). There are monkeys resting on the side of the road as you ride up to Bayon. If you don't bother them, they won't bother you. It's busy, but there is plenty of tree cover so it feels cooler. Also, there is so much to see on Angkor Thom that the tourists are more spread out. We recommend renting mountain bikes to go through Angkor Thom. It's cheap ($6 a day) and you can ride all the way through the gate down to Bayon, the Terrace of the Elephants, Baphuon etc. If you don't, you'll have to wait for your vehicle to make it through the gate and/or walk across and take a tuk tuk on the other side.

Largest of the walled cities in the area, Angkor Thom's entrance is a story in itself - the struggle between the gods and demons played out on the bridge over the moat in the scowling icons on the right, and the smiling on the left. As you are crossing the bridge, reflect on the fact that all you see was created by hand.This was my first stop of the day - start early to avoid the heat - and the crowds were not excessive. Note that you need to buy a pass which must be presented as you travel from major temple to the next. Consider hiring a personal guide - know the best photo opps and offer historical perspective on whatever you may be viewing - around $40 US for the day.Once inside, bayon temple and baphoun are mandatory stops. Surprised that Cambodia allows tourists to climb on and over the ruins - eventually this will compromise the structures. That being said, might be wise to visit before anyone contemplates access restrictions."

Heard of a person with \"many faces\", but ever heard of a stone with many faces (and I do mean LITERALLY, not metaphorically as in a person), well that's the Bayon in Angkor Thom :). Not too many stairs to climb which comes later when you get to the nearby Baphuon, and there's an outdoor Buddha statue between the two temples as well. The top flight of stairs at Baphuon were off-limits when I was there, still the views of trees and forests out to the horizon were great from as far as you could go up, and the climb I'd like to mention was not too bad since it was all wooden stairs from the bottom to the top (even the closed-off part was wooden stairs) unlike at some temples like Ta Keo which I got to later where I encountered some stone stairs which I found them considerably more strenuous than wooden ones.After coming down from Baphuon, head out the pathway on the lake in front of the temple, then left and you're on the Elephants Terrace (so named I guess because of the carvings of elephants on its wall facing the road beside), and going further the same way, you'll get to the Leper King Terrace (also so named because of the carvings of some figures, whether human or otherwise, with their arms raised as if they're supporting the terrace above, so maybe those figures represent the Leper King, the namesake of the terrace).Angkor Thom consisting of the Bayon and Baphuon was the second stop on my Angkor circuit tour starting at Angkor Wat, then Angkor Thom, then Preah Khan, then Ta Keo, then Ta Prohm, then Banteay Kadei & Sras Srang reservoir, then Prasat Kravan and finally Phnom Bakheng the temple on a mountain. If you're coming by minibus from Poipet to Siem Reap and when you get off in Siem Reap and meet the tour operator named Vara, I highly recommend his services - honest, timely pickups and no hidden charges except some small tip to your driver at day's end after the tour.And, one important advice during the tour is not to lose your admission ticket that you obtained at the entrance (the main ticket entrance at the start of the tour - before getting to Angkor Wat) because they do check people for those tickets at each subsequent stop, so be sure NOT to throw your ticket away or misplace it and have it with you at all times during the tour."

Outside the Bayon, the large temple and the Terrasse des Elephants are also well worth seeing. Do be aware, there are restrictions on entering the temple (the same ones as the temple inside Angkor Wat). Your clothing must cover your upper arms and to your knee; children under 12 and pregnant women can't enter.Remember when seeing any of the temples, the weather can change from hot to wet within a short time, so be prepared for all conditions."

As the largest of the temples and one of the few where you can actually see some differences in carvings and construction between a Buddhism and Hinduism (another great reason to have a guide). Like many other temples, there are quite a few stairs you can climb to get to the higher levels of the temple and if you are physically able, they are definitely worth it. Also, Angkor Thom and Angkor Wat will require shorts/skirts beneath the knees and shoulders covered so be mindful of that or you will be going into the shops to buy the traditional pants and cheap t-shirts or scarves."

A pity the restored sculptures at the South Gate don't match the original stone - it will take a lot of time for them to age and acquire a similar state of wear.Take the time to explore the structures and temples of different styles, such as Phimeanakas and the terrace of the Leper King, if you're interested.Go ahead and ask the driver to stop by the quieter North or East Gate (not the Victory Gate that everyone goes through to get to Ta Prohm) for photos. It's worth pointing out that the South Gate features a three-headed elephant."

We rented bikes and it made it much easier to cover more ground and see more. You can actually walk or bike along the original walls which will get you away from the crowds and give you a different perspective. If you're here to see temples, this is a must see complex.Tip: we went early, like right after sunrise. Because of this we got the chance to be practically alone in front of the main gate and inside many of the temples that were really busy later in the day. If you can, do Angkor Thom on a different day than you do Angkor Wat so you can start here and enjoy some quiet time before the tour groups show up."

The carvings and statues were quite amazing and are easy to see and photograph.

Angkor Thom is not just one place, as might be assumed by seeing it as one attraction here on Trip Advisor; it's a complex of many wonderful sights that can be seen enjoyed piece-by-piece as time allows. My particular favourites in the Angkor Thom complex are Bayon Temple (of course), Baphuon Temple, and the Terrace of the Leper King. Look at a map before you make your plans - there's a LOT of ground to cover, but it's definitely worth it!"

We liked the trees still growing through the structure, the rainforest roots claiming whole buildings from the top down, and the feeling of being lost in its corridors and passages.The carved heads, the faces and the sheer size if decorative work is again impressive and the work to keep it from being lost to the jungle again is obvious but essential to restore this valuable piece of world history.It rained heavily when we first arrived.

An excerpt from my blog The Mediocre Wanderer: Before entering the ancient city of Angkor Thom, we stopped at the bridge and checked out the headless demons (right side) and gods (left side) guarding the pathway. Our pictures were taken beside the demons, with the guide romanticizing the act, saying that gods belong on the right of the demons.Being the last and most enduring capital city of the ancient Khmer world, there are several temples that have mostly withstood the test of time. Inside it's walls, you will find the following structure: Bayon, Phimeanakas, Baphuon, Terrace of the Elephants, Terrace of the Leper King, Prah Palilay, Tep Pranam and Prasat Suor Prat. You could go through all of these in half a day. The first on our adventure was the Bayon temple. Expect to climb steep wooden steps, and rough, uneven sandstone blocks. We entered it through it's east gate, where the short walk from the tuktuk parking area is probably the easiest path you'll walk on in the entire structure.Built 100 years after Angkor Wat, it's the next most amazing temple to see after the former, with it's 2000 faces carved on solid rock and 54 towers rising to the sky. It is a Buddhist temple, with pillars, surrounded by 4 faces, representing the omnipresent god. Bas reliefs at the first 2 areas tell of the battles, of a history built upon the blood of it's enemies, and it's people. Personally, it's my favorite temple. After going back to where we started (but not before Phil took pictures of the Terrace of the Leper King, Preah Palilay and Tep Pranam)), we walked through the woods and ended up in Baphuon. An impressive bridge leads up to this temple. Our guide, however, felt compelled to walk under the shade, though the heat from the sun was still quite mild.Baphuon can be a steep climb. So steep that children are not allowed inside the structure. After the carrying and climbing, MAX and I decided to sit this one out, with Phil and our guide, to be the only ones to enter it. After what seemed like half an hour of resting on the giant cut stones at the grounds of Baphuon, Phil and Senchey ushered us to walk once more, into the woods. After walking down a short yet steep slope, we came upon a wall. Entering a small foot gate, we were surround by so many huge trees. We were now in the shadow of the Hindu temple, Phimeanakas. I saw the stairs and thought that carrying MAX through and up this structure, would not do my back any favors.Walking a few more yards, we entered another gate, that led to the Terrace of the Elephants, or where the ancient kings would watch processions and where elephants would perform for royalty. From this vantage point, one can see Prasat Suor Prat, or a series of twelve, nearly identical towers spanning south of the eastern wall of Angkor Thom.After MAX slipped on the muddy elephant grounds at the bottom of the terrace, we were just happy that we had reached the end of part 1 of 3 in our temple run."

I felt like a child on an adventure whilst wondering the temples of Siem Reap. One tip: It's worth getting up early to visit as it does get ridiculously hot!

It encloses wide stretches of jungle and many temples, including the Bayon and the Ta Prohm, and the day I spent walking and cyclying there, from one site to the next one, is the the highlights of my stay in Cambodia.It's possible to buy 1-day / 3-days and 7-days tickets to visit the area, and I think that 1 day is ok for Angkor Thom, but not enough to pay a visit even just to the main sites in the valley (and 7 days is ok just for archaeologists). Anyway it's easily possible to couple it with Angkor Wat in a single day, covering all the main sites.Angkor is very close to Angkor Wat, and just a few Kilometers from Siem Reap , so I got a bike from my guesthouse and went there by myself at sunrise to avoid the crowd and the scams of tuktuk drivers, who asking insane prices to take you there.It's possible to get food and drinks from local shops along the road, anyway food, drinks and maps are cheap and easily available within Angkor Thom itself."

The city within the walls holds quite a number of temples - the great this is that they're all fairly close together so easy to walk around.I was taken there by my TukTuk driver, who entered through the South Gate - this is the most spectacular as the sculptures all have their heads (albeit replacements after the originals were stolen). A great photo opp if you can stop on the bridge on the way in.If you're coming in on tuktuk, get your driver to drop you at Bayon & to go wait at the Terrace of the Leper King. Most of this complex is best done on foot. If you can, go early in the morning to try to avoid the masses.Bayon is by far the most impressive of the temples in this complex, though a fairly small one compared to the likes of Angkor Wat. I loved it so much I came back twice!After Bayon, head on foot to Bauphon & climb to the top to appreciate the scale & the view. Be aware that its actually quite a tough climb up - the \"stairs\" are actually more or less a ladder!Once you're finished with Bauphon you are able to walk around the back (avoiding the busy road & keeping the atmosphere going!) to the Phimeanakas complex. Honestly, this is less impressive than the other two before I didn't bother to actually climb the temple here, but its a great spot to sit in the shade of the trees & have a drink & a rest!After this, head back out to the road & look at the Terrace of the Elephants & the Terrace of the Leper King. Both are pretty impressive!This is all that I did or Angkor Thom - the rest of the pieces in the complex looked much smaller in comparison, and I was pretty pooped by this point! I'd recommend leaving yourself about 2 hours to get around this route, with plenty of time for photos :) Its about a 30 minute tuktuk ride to & from town on top of this."

The entrance is wonderful. Quite narrow and a little dangerous with all the traffic flying through so keep an eye out.

It was once claimed by the Cham Empire from modern day Vietnam, but when King Jayavarman recaptured the city, he began building a wall and a moat around the most important structures within Angkor Thom, including Baphuon and Phimeanakas. In addition, he built the grandiose Bayon temple at the centre of the city, which was used as his state temple. Angkor Thom nowadays is perhaps best known for the Terrace of the Elephants and the Terrance of the Leper King. Most visitors will enter the city of Angkor Thom through the South Gate, but there are four other entrances: North Gate, West Gate, East Gate, and the so-called Victory Gate."

Quite a lot but think what you will see and for what the money is. Go there in the morning before sunrise. Still thousands of people but less than later.There will always be people there, get used to this, it is still ok. During dry season, the lake in front of the temple is nearly dry (so don't be disappointed). Don't forget the backside of the temple, gives nice pictures, too, especially since you have the sun in your back.Even with a guide, you should be done in about 3-4 hours, unless you really want to go \"story after story\" (bear in mind that 1 hour you just wait for the sunrise)."

Another curious thing here are the presence of the monks. There was a huge sitting buddha outside this temple, and what was curious is that in one of the towers, I accidentally saw a monk lying down on his side, as if he was a lying buddha, except the monk was alive, in his orange monk suit, asleep.

The four main tourist areas are Bayon Temple, Baphoun, Elephant Terrace, and Terrace of the Leper King.The Bayon Temple is stunning, and the history is fascinating. You can climb all over the structure, as long as you don't stray off the designated tourist areas.You must dress appropriately because this (and all ancient temples in Siem Reap) are active religious shrines. No bare shoulders, cleavage, short shorts or short dresses. Dress code is enforced.It's unbelievably hot in Siem Reap, even in early April. (And I'm from Florida, so I'm saying this as one who might have a higher than average tolerance for heat.) Go very early in the day, or wait till after 3:00 p.m. to avoid heat exhaustion or worse. It's wise to carry a parasol to keep the direct sun off your head.You'll need 2-3 hours to see everything in the Angkor Thom city complex, and you'll want to be done by 11:00 a.m, if you do a morning tour. Between 11-3 the heat is just too intense. Bring lots of water and wear very light clothing. And wear sturdy shoes because you'll climb hundreds of stair steps on unsteady surfaces.There's no formal concessions area in Angkor Thom, but hundreds of local vendors hawk their wares from tents at the entrance and far inside the city walls. You'll be literally thronged with people begging you to buy water, postcards, scarves, etc. Admission to the temples is $20 US per person per day. Or you can buy a 3-day pass for $40. This includes admission to ALL temples in the Siem Reap area. Each pass is personalized with a photo ID, so don't plan to purchase a partially used pass for less.History and archaeology fans will love this attraction. It's well worth the time and the price of admission."

The sun was going down slowly which gave the whole experience a mystical feel. As we wandered past the Elephant Terrace we saw a party of locals enjoying a picnic- I pointed out to our guide that the car they were with had no number plate-he told us that the owner had probably just taken delivery and was out celebrating and showing off his newly imported vehicle. We also came across two little boys collecting empty plastic water bottles- sometimes the children you see around the temples are actually looking after the area-their families may have the ancestral right to live there and they take pride in maintaining it.

The faces of the Bayon Temple are iconic, but it is a huge structure with masses to see.My one main criticism is that there were no guards anywhere in evidence to stop thoughtless (selfish) tourists from climbing over the guard-ropes and climbing on/touching the stone statues and carvings in their desperation to get a photo of themselves with a 'head'. If the authorities let this go on for much longer, little will be left for future generations as this damages the structures and ruins the carvings.

Here you will find many famous sites such as the Bayon, terrace of elephants, terrace of the Leper king, and Baphuon. You will want to schedule a chunk of time for this place because there is so much to see. Other than the Bayon, other places where not that crowded which was a relief. Also there are other minor temples in this complex such as the Preah Pitu Group which are fantastic. I took some time to explore them it was ridiculous. One thing i really enjoyed about them is that these are practically empty. I was there literally with the whole temple to myself which also made for wonderful photography changes."

Our guide was just so much more! Kanha (of Kanha's Tour Guide Services) had previously emailed a suggested itinerary of our day which transpired to be 'spot on'. It contained enough touring and sufficient detail we could absorb in our one day together, along with other handy tips. Greeting us at our hotel with a kind and beautiful smile, Kanha kindly presented us with a gift. Her transport was clean and comfortable and, very importantly, airconditioned! Kanha was very mindful of our physical abilities in the hot climate; her supply of cool towels and drinking water was plentiful and generous.The tempo of our tour was comfortable and, her experience steered us away from the hordes of other tourists visiting the temples. It was almost as if we were the only one's there! The tour and the region did not disappoint. Though, I'm sure that was due to Khana's good management rather than our good fortune. Our experience was exactly as Kanha had promised; unforgettable. We will cherish our memories of the day forever. :)"

Thom is big enough that you need transportation to get around to all the sights. There are places to eat outside, but I think the food is overpriced and low quality. I had sweet and sour chicken for $6, it was not tasty. The people there are very friendly. I had a guide book but no guide.

This is one of the best if not the best complex of temples anywhere in the world because it has so many amazing historical sites in one very large area, ok the Taj Mahal complex is stunning but is not as old. Baphoun & Bayon as individual temples are brilliant but so to are the kings gardens. A wonderful walk thru historical gardens trying to imagine just how these places would have looked a 1000 years ago. As in other reviews I would really love CGI to be used to recreate a vision of how all the temples once looked because like the pyramids there was a lot of colour that is no longer present except on very small sections, clearly in their day these places were magnificent. On the outer wall of the Kings garden there is a wall with a line of elephants carved in to it, when you see the scale of the carving it is mind boggling to imagine how many craftsmen must have been working on these sites at any one time. A note to first time visitors, suggest you arrange with your hotel or guide to buy your 3 day passes a day or so before you commence your tour of the temples, it will avoid a potential loss of 2 hrs at the ticket office which on most days is a nightmare! The 3 day pass is valid for up to 7 days, so buying the day before still gives 3 days out of 6 to choose."

We were with a bicycling group, and after making our way through traffic, immediately upon entering the gates of Angkor Thom, we turned off the main road, headed left up a hill, and in 2 minutes found ourselves on top of the \"wall\" that surrounds this old temple city. There was no signage to point out that this was a possible approach, and we were just about the only ones on it. Eventually we made our way to the Bayon Temple, and later in the week came back to visit some of the other areas (elephant terrace, sunset hill) - but the highlight was just biking along the wall. I believe you can walk this path and you don't need a guide, so my advice is to find your way to explore the perimeter, and then make your way into the inside of the temple afterward."

What makes the Frieze at Angkor Thom so impressive to me is the depiction of everyday events like fishing, cooking, harvesting etc alongside the images of marine war and dead bodies floating in the water and being devoured by crocodiles etc.The other thing of interest was how being so pragmatic when the rulers converted to Hinduism they set about systematically excising the buddha images from the stonework.And yes you can ride an elephant here for a fee. As an early explorer said though an hour on an elephant is about the equivalent of 4 on a horse.And you can also get a shameless selfie if you have a local tourist policeman nearby to set it up for you and then sell you a very nice copy police badge."

The city is surrounded by a moat, and the bridges crossing the moat are lined with statues of devas on the left and asuras on the right, Hindu deities representing good and evil.Inside the walls are many fascinating sights to see: Bayon, Baphuon, The Terrace of the Elephants, The Leper King Terrace, Phimeanakas, Preah Pithu and Prasat Suor Prat among them. You can easily spend a full day (at least!) exploring the various temples and other archaeological sites at Angkor Thom. You can walk all of it, of course, but I recommend hiring a tuk-tuk driver so you can cover more ground and also have a little rest and cool down in between each stop.There are places to get hot food and cold water within the city walls, and there are decent bathrooms as well. For an enjoyable break, there is also a spot along the main road where families of monkeys gather, and they are quite amusing to sit and watch for a bit; you can buy fruit or lotus roots from locals there to feed them.I enjoyed Angkor Thom very much, and wish we had set aside more time to see all of its many treasures. It's a fascinating place, and I hope to make it back there again one day."

Don't feel you have to see them all. Three full days of touring are important to do this world-class venue justice but these are the Don't Miss sites, in this order of priority: Angkor Wat, of course, the stellar, Number One site; Bayon; Terrace of the Elephants and Terrace of the Leper King; Ta Prohm; Bandrey Srei; Preah Kahn; Pre Rup; Neak Prean.Give yourself time to visit your three favorites a second time within your three day itinerary. Many are so overwhelming in their interest, architecture, and artistry that you must see them at least twice to begin to appreciate them. We had to see the Churning of the River of Milk at Angkor Wat three times, as it was so artistically stunning, and is comparable to the greatest carvings anywhere in the World."

This has a sense of space which I did not feel with Angkor Wat, The buildings are slightly worse for wear but still very impressive with the gate ways, the terrace of the leper king: the terrace of the Elephant there is a lot to see. Highly recommend you pick up a guide to talk you through this city. Travelling about in a tuk-tuk is an easier way to get a feel for the space, so when you have to walk you are not drained. I did the early start (5am) for Angkor Wat and then moved on to Angkor Thom. By lunch time I was done in"

A drive up to the temple we saw monkeys sitting on the side of the road. You ventured into the temple climbing up onto rocks and taking it all in. If you could manage the steep stairwell you could go to the top level, where the view was absolutely breathtaking. There were performers dressed in costume and for one American dollar you could have your photograph taken with them. There was even elephant rides for 15 US dollars. Of course the usual vendors were there selling their goods. Cold drinks available. And as always don't forget the insect repellent. (Upon entry to the temples you must have your photograph taken - and this ID to be carried on you). An absolute must to see when in Cambodia !!"

Angkor : An epic on stone If you love historical and mythological sites with a taste for sculptures and architectural marvels, there is no place better than Siem Reap (Angkor) of Cambodia. Angkor (=Capital city derived from Sanskrit word Nagar) was the heart of the immense Khmer empire that flourished in Indo-China from 9th to 13th century. It is today an awe inspiring magnificent archaeological park. I and my wife visited Angkor in Oct-2013 for 5 days. We are Hindus from Tamilnadu of India. Tamilnadu in India is well known for the temples steeped in history and Hindu mythology, some of them date back to pre-Christian era. So we are naturally attracted towards Angkor. Angkor Thom: We spent two half days at Angkor Thom (Capital city, the Big). It is a huge city which housed 1 million people inside its compounds in the 12th century. It has four gates one each in the four directions and one more gate on the East called victory gate. Each of the four gates have 54 devas on one side and 54 asuras on the other side of the Cause ways holding the big serpent Vasuki in their attempt to churn the cosmic ocean of milk. Ten headed Ravana is spearheading the asuras by anchoring near the head of Vasuki while Hanuman is doing the same with Devas anchoring near the tail of Vasuki. The gates sport benevolent looking and smiling faces of Bodisattva Lokeswara on four sides of the tower. The face has broad noses and remind us of the statues of Pallava style of Dravidian architecture. The mysterious face is based on Buddha's calm face with facial features of King Jayavarman 7 (affectionately called as J7), arguably the best Khmer king. A big moat is running around the city. As we had gone in a rainy month moat was full. At the center of Angkor Thom is the Bayon temple which is a Buddhist temple with a good fusion of Hindu symbolism. Our guide Chhen Kol explained that J7, though himself a follower of Mahayana Buddhism, exhibited tolerance of religions and provided places of worships not only for Buddhists and Hindus, but also for those following animism and spirit followers. The panels depict normal daily life in those periods - cooking, food distribution, boar cooking, barbequing, midwife nursing a delivery of a baby etc. There are scenes of war and close combat between Chams (Vietnamese) and Khmers sculpted in detail. The naval fight in Tonle Sap lake with the flora and fauna of the lake is also very vividly described. Army march with its band, supply lines are well presented. In short they are all poetries of stone. The towers sport the faces (supposed to be 54 in total, but available now is slightly less). My admiration for J7 is big and I intend to do an in-depth study on this fascinating king. For want of space I stop my commentary on Bayon here. There are so many places of historical importance are in Angkor Thom. To name a few, 1) Elephant Terrace from where the king and royalty watched games on the ground 2) Leper king terrace which hosts the cremation place of J7, the great. Today a statue resembling Buddha is kept on the place of creamation 3) The lunar towers which were used to judge the right from the wrong in a case referred to royal court 4) Phimean akas (Royal temple) 5) Baphuon a huge temple"

The carved faces that adorn the magnificent temple are everywhere and as a result they are a photographers delight. Be sure to walk into the central depth of the temple so you can look up at the sky - a great sight within this ancient architecture. The inside stone pavers can get very slippery so take care.You should allow at least an hour or two here. Be careful if you take a packed breakfast box (available from most hotels if you pre-order it) because the monkeys that 'caretake' this temple think that your breakfast is theirs and they will do anything to get it.

It is US$15 a person, but worth it, as he takes you around the site and you get a different view. I was a initially concerned about exploitation of the elephants, but they used to be used in the illegal logging trade and there is no natural jungle left for them to live in, if they were released they would starve. They are well cared for and fed and kept in their social group so while not ideal, they are well off."

So the manager gave us a map of the temples which truly guided us especially to this temple. When we got here, we were just instructed by our tuk-tuk driver to meet him at the other part of the area. So I guess we didn't understand that there are several temples. When we got inside, we just walked and looked around. There is this teenager who asked us \"where are you from lady\" This is they're usual introduction to all tourists. So since I thought he's a local and he's being nice of taking pictures of us, we accommodated him. But we he found out we're already leaving, he asked us a donation which he ended up compelling us to give more. He explained to us that he does not have a father anymore and he wants to study. So my hubby gave him US$5 as a donation but he asked for more. I just asked my hubby to leave him since he is already harassing us for more money. So when we exited, we heard some Korean Nationals being hysterical because he lost his expensive cellphone and wallet. I just told my hubby that just take note of his valuables since there are some locals roaming around and you really don't know their intention of talking to you even you are in good faith. This is our first day of tour and first temple we visited. I think anywhere you go you should always take extra caution especially on your valuables.Good thing we didn't lose anything but the experience of being harassed to a foreign country because of money is quite traumatic. So whenever we go around and locals ask us where we are from, we just pretend that we didn't hear them and didn't mind them even they are just in front of us. We didn't ask any locals anymore (except if they're officials of the temple/security guards). Just beware.We just went on the the other temples of Baphoun (which has very steep stairs. This temple has strict officials and had DRESS CODE. They will not allow you to get inside the temple if you have short shorts or skirt and revealing or skimpy outfit. just make sure you have shawls with you to cover your legs (considering the weather is seriously warm!)"

The first place we were brought to by our driver when visiting the Angkor Archaeological Park area was Angkor Thom (Great Khmer City), which was the great ancient capital city of the Khmer Empire constructed during the late 12th century.It was a very large area about 3km by 3 km and fortified by an 8m high laterite wall all along its perimeter and accessible only through five tower gates. Angkor Thom is also surrounded by a 100m wide moat and the water seen from the Southern Gate, our entry point, was so calm and serene with small ripples caused by some gentle breeze. The road leading to the gate was even more spectacular with 2 rows of very much weathered huge stone figures, 54 lining each side, leading up to the towering gate, and folklore has it that the left row were gods and the right demons but both meant to guard Angkor Thom.The Southern Gate tower, constructed of sandstone rises up to a height of about 23m and a four-faced stone sculpture like that of Bayon Temple\u2019s could be seen right above the entrance of the towering gate. After passing through the gate, which was only one truck wide, there is a long laterite road which welcomes you with lush tropical trees lining both sides and this road leads to the other temples and attractions within this ancient capital city viz. Bayon Temple which is centrally located, Baphuon Temple, Terrace of the Elephants, Terrace of the Leper King and a couple of other smaller temples. Angkor Thom must have been a grand thriving capital city during the rule of the Buddhist king, Jayavarman VII and thereafter, as attested to by the remnants of the massive ruins within the area now. It is definitely a must-see in the itinerary of any visitor to Siem Reap."

It probably includes some other smaller temples but i'm not very sure about them as my family and i only went to these three temples. This temple is fairly small and we covered it in under an hour (probably because we were exhausted after walking in Angkor Wat and wanted to finish viewing all the temples quickly). However there were very little tour guides at the entrance of this temple and we did not take hire a tour guide here. I would recommend getting a tour guide from Angkor Wat (there are plenty of tour guides flocking there) and make arrangements so that he would be a tour guide for all three temples (Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and La Trom). Having getting used to having a tour guide at Angkor Wat, walking on our own here seemed a little made us feel a little lost. I believe i would have enjoyed it more if someone explained to me what i was looking at. p.s. I 'm not sure if there are proper eateries within all the temple complex, so maybe it might be good to pack sandwiches or so for lunch. We did not pack anything and were wary to eat from roadside stalls and hence had a very late lunch after we have finished viewing all three main temples. Walking around without lunch was indeed tiring!"

The remaining stone temples and buildings are far enough apart that if you imagine the wooden buildings that used to fill the gaps you can see that this would have been quite an amazing city. Devote an entire morning to it and get there early (no later than 7 or 8am) because you do not want to be braving the harsh sun after about noon. Be prepared for some climbing of steep steps, and also remember to dress modestly because a few of the temples (such as Baphuon) request that your knees and shoulders are covered. Also wear supportive footwear as the ground is very uneven and my fianc\u00e9 did his ankle in the very first temple we looked at.Make sure not to miss the East and South gates. The towers on the eastern side of the city are fascinating (they are named Prasat Suor Prat - read up on the legend surrounding them) but the locals believe it is bad luck to go there. So if you are with a driver try to view the towers from an acceptable distance, so as not to offend or worry them.We didn't go for an elephant ride (they didn't look happy)."

The Bayon is the temple that you will have seen on many postcards - adourned with trippy facades of faces - it is incredible, especially in the late morning when the sun finally makes it over the foliage and hits the temple, or close to sunset when the soft light gives the faces an ethereal quality.You will also find Ta Prohm, commonly known as the 'Tomb Raider' temple. Overgrown and left for centuries to the ravages of the forest you will see giant tree roots intertwined with the incredible Angkorian architecture - it is a fascinating, spellbounding infusion of man made inegnuity and the power of nature.If you are using Siem Reap as your base I would strongly recommend that rather than using a Tuk Tuk you take a bike (you can hire them for as little as $1 a day) - it is a far richer and more rewarding experience that allows you to take in the scale of the site and enjoy the jungle too. The tuk tuks are so cramped that you can see very little and you will spend a lot of time spluttering from the engine and exhaust fumes. For longer journeys you may need a tuk tuk but Angor Thom (and Angkor Wat) are an easy 15-20 minute cycle from Siem Reap.Talk to local guides, hoteliers or other travellers about what are the best times to visit the temples. Massive swathes of Korean tourists career through the temples by the busload and this can be really irritating and ruin the ambience and experience a little bit. With a little investigation you can avoid the onslaught as most of the package tourists follow the same programs."

Inside Angkor Thom the best temple is the Bayon, which is right in the middle of it, the second best temple is right next to it and is called Baphuon, then you can take a walk down the Elephant Terrace and carry on visiting more temples if you have the time.Tips:Take a hat, sun lotion and water.Do not wear sandals, IF it rains the ground can become muddy.Take plenty of memory in your camera, do not underestimate the amount of pictures you will take.Inside Angkor Thom, across the road from the Elephant Terrace, there are places to eat/ drink and toilet facilities.The best tuk-tuk driver in Siem Reap is a guy called Rado Doung (tuk-tuk 5). You can find him outside the Tara Angkor Hotel, on the road to Angkor Wat.Take a map of the temples inside Angkor Thom with you, so if you have time, you can explore the whole area.

Sadly, walking along the top it is clear the paving has been \"restored\" very poorly. The northerly half of the terrace is called the Terrace of the Leper King, we were told that this was not because he had leprosy but because the lichens that were growing on his statue looked as if he had.The climb up Phimeanakas is worthwhile, the steps are not signposted and are at the back of the structure. At the top, a good view and an area to climb around but be warned it is not all neat and tidy as some of the fallen stonework has not been cleared, which is fine so long as you are careful."

Fantastic entrance gate with loads of statues lining the way in one side gods and the other demons both pulling on a long snake. Fantastic carvings in great condition and the Bayon was wonderful with its beautifully carved faces. It was boiling and very humid when we visited (in the afternoon!!!!! - but it was part of the tour), we nearly melted. Visiting temples is my 'thing' but even I was waving the white flag by the end of the afternoon with total exhaustion. We only had 2 full days in Siem Reap one day to visit the outlying temples and the second day to visit Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom, this is a hard trip to do in a day but worth it. The trouble is if you broke this trip up to 2 mornings when it is cooler (JUST), I don't know what you would do in the afternoon, we couldn't have sun bathed it was too humid it was like sitting in a sauna our hotel had a lovely pool but we could not sit outside by it. To summarise we had a fantastic day, Angkor Thom was amazing I think I preferred it to Angkor Wat (am I allowed to say that?). Enjoy and count yourself privilaged to visit such a fantastic historical site."

Nestled in a nice forested area, the restoration works aren't quite as extensive as in Angkor Wat so more of it seems to lie as ruins and heaps of rubble that seems to shroud the place in a bit more mystique than the more touristy counterpart.

The first evening arrival I had one of the bell hops take me around to the bars on a motodop and they were all kind of trashy and exotic at the same time, fun, maybe a little like fantasy island in the middle of a rubbish heap. I got the multiple day pass for Angkor Wat which allowed a first free sunset admission. Rented a bike and rode up to wait at the gate where you can chat with other visitors while you wait. Then the next day hired an a/c van to visit the farther temples outside the main ring and my favourite had to be Bang Melea. It's a couple of hours out and back round trip. However arranging a tuk-tuk to take you to Bayoun Temple in late afternoon for sunset is a great bet. What an incredible place to see the sunset; the light and these monolithic multihued ancient stone heads as well as the opportunity for a more intimate visit with fewer people around was mystical and marvellous. Scrabbling and exploring around the Bayoun and hearing the voices of others carrying through the passageways was an unforgettable experience. However for longer day trips throughout Angkor Wat by tuk-tuk would recommend a gas mask or suitable breathable scarf as the dust on the roads around the various ring temples can be pretty bad. The farther you want to go the more suitable a proper a/c transport will get."

The nation itself is a dismal result of a mad mans rule - but the temples are worth the price of having to put up with the country for a few days. While Angkor Wat gets the glory - Angkor Thom deserves as much praise or more. It was large enough so the crowds were not too overwhelming. It was as photographic as any place I have ever been. And it was busy - as Cambodia's tourism industry grows by leaps and bounds over the next few years, these temples will be a mosh pit at best. The entrance with its \"receiving line\" of sculpture warriors, and that cave like entrance must have been truly daunting in its day. A fascinating place to visit for an hour or two."

Flanking the causeway on the right were 36 angry looking demons, pulling on a Naga (snake) and on the left by 36 smiling gods pulling on a second Naga. From a distance the Bayon looked like a jumbled mess - a bunch of ruined towers surrounded by heaps of stone rubble. Past the perky hawkers are the steps to the first tier of the Bayon. The large outer wall is covered from top to bottom with intricately carved, beautifully detailed, and well preserved bas-reliefs of historical battles, processions, mythology, and scenes from village life. The same wall also serves as part of a structure containing another gallery of reliefs on the interior. The paths inside are circuitous, and non-intuitive. In each direction were long shadowy pathways decorated with bas-reliefs in surprisingly good condition. The second tier is the home to the many faces of Avelokitesvara. They were there, everywhere you looked. Bayon had originally 49 towers, out of which only 37 are still standing, all crowned with faces looking out to the four cardinal points. It is also possible that the faces represented that of Jayavarman VII himself, as a new expression of an old Khmer tradition of belief in the apotheosis of kings.While in Angkor Thom do not miss out on the terrace of the elephants and the terrace of the leper king. The elephant terrace is decorated by a procession of elephants in bas-relief, each about 2 meters high. The terrace of the leper king has one of the big surprises - a 5 headed horse carved in bas-relief.Visited in January 2006"

Unlike Ankor Wat that is spread out and classy, Ankor Thom (the central temple) is a temple of faces. it is not known if the faces belong to the king or gods but are beautifully carved and have a variety of expresssions.

You can also learn a but about the culture, and the poverty of the local populace just by virtue of the entrance gate areas where they swarm to sell trinkets and objects like drums & statues. Keep your guard up if you wish but also be mindful to stay polite (and firm if you are not interested) and kind to the hawkers and children as they are just trying to make a living in a hard world. We saw some very unkind tourists and that was very unfortunate to me. The sites itself are amazing, if you are a history/archaeological buff, then it may also be the place for you. Many people had a guide with them which I think makes sense but we also liked time to look and take pictures. We bought a guidebook for 7 and later realized we were highly charged but then again bargaining with such poor people didn't make the most sense either to me. So just be aware of a price that you find fairer and be happy with your price and purchase. As most note, it gets very hot very fast so sun protection is a must as is mosquito protection. Dress reasonably but also for the heat. Wear good footwear as there are many open branches and uneven surfaces. Bring H2O or buy at the hawker stands outside. Enjoy."

As I understand it, this is the ancient imperial capital that encloses with a wall and moat all of the major religious and historical sites near Siem Reap. The area is extensive, and there are a number of dramatic gateways that give access to various sections. The buildings of interest are widely separated by landscaped parkland with artificial lakes and canals, as well as by natural swampland and jungle. The most celebrated are Angkor Wat and Bayon Temple ( both of which I have reviewed independently). Other notable sites within the overall complex include the Terraces of the Elephants and Lepers, and the Temples of Baphuon and Phimeanakas that actually preceded the foundation of the imperial city. As to be expected, they are very much the worse for wear, and one has to tread carefully over piles of fallen stones, and up staircases worn thin by the feet of armies, but there is an awesome quality to these monuments that few historic sites elsewhere in our universe can deliver, and it needs an entire day of strenuous physical commitment to do justice to the riches on offer. But be warned: food and refreshments are scarce, and decent toilets even more so."

There are only three places where they can be found (so steer away from these places to not ruin your day for those fed up with these happenings), but if you need water or food or even souvenirs, go to these people. (1) parking lot east of Bayon, (2) parking lot across the Terrace of the Leper King, and (3) a few meters away from the back of the Terrace of the Leper King. Things to do in Angkor Thom if you just have the whole afternoon or morning. (1) Enjoy the Bayon with its many face towers. (2) Scale the entirety of Baphuon. This is not for the ones who are afraid of heights as the stairs going up to the top is quite steep. (3) See the site where the Royal Palace of Angkor Thom once stood, but its temple is still there and climbable from the back. (4) Check out the Elephant Terrace. (5) View the hidden reliefs of the Terrace of the Leper King. The Angkor Thom complex is a huge place quadruple the size of Angkor Wat complex, but a walking tour of it suffices if you want an experience albeit very draining. At night, your excuse for a foot massage would be because you did something as crazy as walking all over Angkor Thom."

In a less good state of repair but the Bayon is particularly fine. 47 towers, originally, with the face of a Buddha on each of the four sides. Not as strenuous a visit as Angkor Wat and not an active Buddhist temple. Wear comfortable walking shoes and take a bottle of water. It can be hot here. Visit the Angkor National Museum in Siem Reap before your visit if you can to put the temple into a historical perspective."

You cannot miss the Bayon temple with those legendary smiling, calm faces. It is the place to linger a bit and recall the movies which used it as a set. Baphuon is also grand. It is an exploration of its own and you get there through the causeway 200m long which gives everybody lots of photo opportunities. Do not miss the Terrace of Elephants used for viewing parades.

They have covered the worn and extremely narrow stone steps with wooden steps with metal rails, but these too are still steep and you have to keep going as you will create a traffic jam if you stop along the way to check the view or catch your breath. You cannot climb the last part to the top, but you still get a view from the topmost tier. If you have some of your party who have not done the climb get them to come around to the right hand side where they can either take your photograph coming down the steep steps or they can join you on the continued tour to other parts of the monument located beyond the main one. At the rear of the monument is a strange outcrop. There is an old photograph under a shelter that shows the outcrop in earlier times, where it clearly shows a face. It would have been a really large face.Generally, your driver or tuk tuk driver will have left you at the main gate and told you that he will collect you after you have walked past the Elephant Terrace. They are required to park near the trinket shops. There is a toilet hidden away behind the trinket shops.If you do not wish to visit the other parts of the temple you can walk along the top of the structure and have a great view of the 12 Suor Prat towers. No one seems to have any information about these towers but they are lovely to see.Along the top of the walk there are built out areas where the kings would sit and entertainers perform."

Most people will go through the south gate first and chances are that there could be a lot of people there, so if you can, try to visit the Victory Gate also.It will help you to understand the temples inside the walls of Angkor Thom if you read up on them before you go. The best book to get is \"Ancient Angkor\" by Michael Freeman and Claude Jacques, and to also have a map of the area, so you don't miss anything. Don't wear your new white trainers around these place, because in the event of rain there will be mud. You can easily have something to eat/drink just outside the Elephant Terrace and there are also toilet facilities there.Tip for getting rid of locals pestering you: Pretend you can't speak English/French, if you don't have a language in commom with them, they can't talk to you.Don't understimate the amount of photos you will take around here, make sure you have enough memory in your camera.Best tuk-tuk driver in Siem Reap is Mr. Rado (tuk-tuk number 5),he is outside the Tara Angkor Hotel every morning"

They were carved after the stones were put in place. I cannot put into words the craftsmanship that was put into to the work on these temples.If you want to enhance your experience I would suggest an official tour guide. They have had to pass a knowledge test to be able to tour you around.The guide we had Mr. Sarun(Saroon) Peng is knowledgeable and personable.His email is chansarun@hotmail.com. He will enhance you experience in Angkor and other sites within Cambodia..The one day pass is $20 dollars USTake lots of $1,$5,$10 and $20 as they prefer US dollars. If you get any of the Cambodian currency leave it in your room. If you tip, several US dollars are acceptable.Do not give children who are begging money. It only encourages them to beg and not attend school. They may look cute but they can pick your pocket so be careful.To see all of Angkor you need a couple of days.I was there in the rainy season so there are less people. Bring some rain gear and an umbrella! Don't let the rain slow you down. Angkor is one of the must see sites if you love to travel.I will also point out that the level of English fluency amazed me in Cambodia.GO you won't be disappointed"

Far less crowed than the main site, and I wish we had more time to spend here than we did. We only had about an hour, and as such, all we had time to do was march straight through the center with our guide and pick up our tuk-tuk on the other side. There are many opportunities to take photos, though they have guide ropes to shield some of the more popular sites from casual touching. As many others mentioned, Tomb Raider shot some scenes here, and is as impressive as fine of an example of any overgrown temple you will ever encounter in South East Asia. I spent five days in Cambodia, and this one short hour was easily the highlight of my entire trip. If I ever make it back, this will be one of the few locations I plan to revisit, albeit without a guide and a time limit to adhere to.NOTE: I would advise to be careful of what you choose to purchase when in the area. My guide informed us that the \"disabled musicians\" you encounter on either side are actually quite wealthy by Cambodian standards. Most own cars and good homes and have hired help to drive them around."

She did not mention anything about this much bigger complex and the remarkable temples on it. That is why when I did a research for my temple itinerary to Siem Reap, my excitement doubled when I realized aside from Angkor Wat, there are many many more to see. I never thought there\u2019d be too many ancient temples in Cambodia. Half our day 1 we spent on Angkor Thom; the other half we spent for Angkor Wat and the petite circuit temples (Sra Srang, Banteay Kdei, Ta Prohm, Ta Keo & Thommanon \u2013 all completed in the morning). It would be ideal to start trekking the temples of Angkor Thom in the afternoon. Right after lunch, our tuktuk driver Sokha dropped us right in front of the Terrace of the Elephants. It was an easy stroll from this point to the Terrace of the Leper King, Phimeanakas, Baphuon, and ending the day with a blast at Bayon. These temples are located closely to each other so take your time. It will be extra exhausting if you\u2019re in a hurry.Angkor Thom has a moat too but it has dried up, unlike Angkor Wat whose moat is still filled with water today has provided protection to the temple from encroachment by the jungle. That is why Angkor Wat is a well-preserved temple while Angkor Thom has plenty of vegetation and giant trees growing on ruins."

However, only the temples remain since they were made of stone; the houses are long gone as they were built of wood. Angkor Thom includes Angkor Wat, which is the best preserved and largest set of temples. We spent just 1 day here; but many people spend several days. For me, 1 day was enough. The multiple complexes are of Hindu/Buddhist temples, and the cost of entry is $20pp for 1 day. Best to take a rickshaw/tuk-tuk for a whole day as they will shuttle you from temple complex to temple complex as they are a little distant and walking in the heat is no fun (I believe this cost us about $25 for the whole day, English speaking driver). Good idea to hire a guide (only licensed guides are allowed to act as guides; ours was arranged by our tuk-tuk driver for about $25 for the day. Both spoke good English. The best temples I found, were the Bauphon, Bayon, The tree temple (where tress have grown over the structures), and Angkor Wat of course, which is the climax, best preserved and huge in size."

Don't confuse my words, I think Angkor Wat is absolutely stunning, but Thom shows its age through the decay of the building. I also don't recall any noticeable rebar (steel used to reinforce concrete) at Thom.Anyway, you obviously are not going to skip Angkor Wat, nor should you, but make sure to have enough time to do Angkor Thom properly as well. I say go when the heat is lowest, forget about morning or afternoon, just worry about shade and heat since you are completely exposed at Thom."

These can be purchased from a central point (near Angkor Wat) and will be personal to holder (they'll take your picture for the pass and all passes are non-transferable.) Passes cost USD20/day, $40/3days or $60/7days. Expensive, but well worth the money.---------------Angkor Thom actually consists of several temples, all housed within a maaaaaassively walled \"city\". We were told that sunset at Angkor Thom is beautiful, so we had arranged to start exploring Angkor Thom after lunch up until sunset. BIG mistake. I don't know if it was just the timing of the weather in May, but it was too hot and muggy to thoroughly explore all the temples within Angkor Thom from 3-7pm. The heat really gets to you. I'd recommend you take a sunRISE at the temples instead, hang about and explore in the morning when it is cool, then leave when the day starts to get *really* hot and sensibly rest in your hotel until dark makes Siem Reap cool(er) again!Highlights for Angkor Thom, tho: Bayon temple, Baphuon, Terrace of the Leper King. If you can't find the will to see anything else in Angkor Thom, these three are worth the trouble. Bayon is where you'll find magnificent towers of faces carved into the four cardinal points. Mind-blowingly awesome.At Baphuon, you'll be able to climb right up to the highest terrace for stunning views over the whole of Angkor Thom. What I found most amazing was that only then did I get the full appreciation of how grand the Ancient Khmer civilization must have been in its hey-day. Be warned, though, that climbing up the terraces is not for the faint-hearted. The ladders are STEEP and pretty high. There is also close to no shade when you're up there on the terraces, so having a hat, umbrella and water are pretty essential if you're planning to (unwisely) make that climb in the middle of the afternoon, like we did.The Terrace of the Leper King are walls and walls some 20 ft tall, full of beautiful carvings. I forget what the murals were supposed to depict, but it was quite enjoyable walking along the maze-like corridors between the terraces and just looking at the carvings. EXTRA note: The guidebooks that hawkers will try to sell you? I usually give buying tourist faff a miss, but some of the books are actually pretty good. You can get them for as low as USD1, although some hawkers will try to sell them to you for USD60. I'd pay anywhere from USD5-10 per book. An average Khmer's meal will cost approximately $2 (6,000-8,000KHR), so I figure giving them a price of a day's meals in exchange for a book is pretty fair."

Once inside, we first stopped at Bayon, which was probably my favorite temple of the day.

Here you can access a hidden terrace where the carvings look newer than others as they were covered up for centuries.For more info and photos, check out my blog post at http://growninsouthernground.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/siem-reap-day-1-angkor-wat-angkor-thom-ta-prohm-apsara-dance-performance/."

A little further out is Baphuon temple, which is also impressive. Phimeanakas and the Royal Palace are fun to explore. It's awesome to think about how impressive this all would have been back in its full glory. The Elephant Terrace, with carved elephant heads and trunks coming out of the walls is cool. Head down the terrace of the Leper King to see huge tree roots trying to re-claim some of the old buildings there. This isn't the same site as Ta Prohm, where Tomb Raider was filmed.

Being a much natural sequence from our visit to Angkor Wat, our great tuk-tuk guide Mr. tee (more details under Angkor Wat) took us to the south gate entrance of the walled Angkor Thom and after a few historic observations drove us to the Bayon Temple from where we continued walking ourselves via the Baphuon temple, Elephants terrace and the Leper King (from where it is believed that the King overlooked the parades passing by). Angkor Thom may appear a bit dull compared to Angkor Wat temple but nevertheless the ancient grandeur of this city makes it a not-to-be-missed on any tour to Siem Reap."

One of my favorite experiences in this vast sprawling site is along the south wall towards the southwest corner of the complex. Enter at the southgate and walk along the wall (there's a path) till you meet the corner. Turn to your left and there is a small temple about 10-15 yard to the north. It provides an amazing view of the West Baray at sunset. And you are guaranteed to be alone to enjoy it. Just bring a flashlight for the trek back. Also, take some time to visit the Preah Pithu group in the northeast corner of the site. Few people do and you'll be rewarded with a peaceful experience that is in stark comparison to the tour bus mania of the Bayon."

As you progress up the floors the carvings with the smiling faces seem to welcome you and the views are just great. There are a ton of other temples too numerous to visit so you have to choose your itinerary carefully. We simply opted to walk along the Terrace of the Elephants with its superb carvings - great place."

This is a review of Angkor Thom, the main complex, which includes the Angkor Wat temple. The Angkor Thom complex consists of the world famous Angkor Wat, the Bayon temple & several others temples. Scattered over an immense area, the entry is either $20(single day), $40(3 days, which you do not need to use consecutively) & $60(7 days, which you not need to use consecutively). Starting at the Angkor Wat, it is possible to cover the highlights in one day(we did not have more time, sadly). Starting very early morning, we watched the sunrise at Angkor Wat at around 5 AM. Spent the next 3 hours at Angkor Wat & left at 8 AM just when hordes of tourists were arriving(go early, or go at the end of the day!). Went back to our hotel to have breakfast & returned to Bayon at around 9.30 AM. Spent 2 hours there(it is much smaller in scale than Angkor Wat) & then went on to the other temples. Finished with lunch around 2.30 PM(tired by then!) & then or tuk tuk driver took us to Ta Prohm, where the temples among the jungles are. At around 4.30 PM, we left Ta Prohm & went back past Angkor Wat to a temple, where we climbed up & watched the most beautiful sunset. This is just a world class complex of temples! My recommendations would be; 1. Start in the early morning with Angkor Wat, or Bayon, since these are the ones that get most tourists later in the day. It wasn\u2019t very crowded at 5 AM, but the hordes started coming in around 8 AM . 2. Plan at least 2-3 hours for Angkor Wat, 2 hours for Bayon, & then depending on your stamina & the age of the group(it\u2019s a lot of walking between temples, a lot of climbing & not much shade), another 4-5 hours for the other temples in the complex 3. Make sure to carry everything you might need-water, camera batteries, caps- unlike a lot of other tourist spots, not many shops selling this stuff once you start walking 4. Hang on to your pass- apparently there is a fine if you lose/misplace it, though honestly, that whole day, we never saw anyone checking anyone\u2019s pass, nor were we asked to show ours. 5. Ladies- make sure your shoulders are covered & no short shorts- we did see people not being allowed in at some points because of the dress code. 6. The best route seems to be starting at Bayon & going on to the exit where the tuk tuk drivers await you- the temples get progressively smaller as you go- which is a good thing for when energy is flagging! Overall, it\u2019s a stunning complex- we started by watching the sunrise at Angkor Wat & ended with watching a sunset over the temples- just one of the best days ever! If you can, budget atleast 2 days to see everything & do it justice!;-)"

If Angkor Wat is known for its bas-relief and Bantey Srey for its intricate carvings, then Angkor Thom is famous for its face-towers. Angkor Thom is actually a large 9 km\u00b2 area and one of the many temples inside it is Bayon where you will see the face-towers.Inside Bayon, look for the locals in traditional costumes who will offer to take your pictures with them for a small donation. I gave them $2 and they took about ten pictures which turned out great. You can also find several vantage points where you can pose to make it appear that you are kissing one of the face-towers.You will most likely get dropped off on the South Gate so take the time to admire the bridge over a river that connects to Tonl\u00e9 Sap. Your first stop will be Bayon and then the Baphoun temple. Take the steep stairs to the top for a picturesque view of the surrounding areas. You can also climb the next temple, Phimeanakas.If you walk towards the road, you can walk towards the North Gate with stops at the Elephants Terrace and Leper King Terrace. Prasat Sour Prat is on the other side of the road. We were at Angkor Thom for about two hours."

Time stood still here and the sites have not been affected by 'loud', in all senses of the word, caf\u00e9s or other tourist rubbish. Bravo to Cambodia and UNESCO. A walk over the field stretching out in front of the elephant terrace towards the Prasats is fabulous and often forgotten due to time constraints or (too) strict schedules.

We had visited this place early this month and were most impressed by it. The main temple has a smiling face looking at you from every place. The sculpted images that stare at you from all sides makes for a very interesting sight. From the top of this temple, the entire complex can be seen to be a very large one with several structures spread over the place. It is really very impressive that the kings of those days had a grand vision and spared no effort to bring it to life.The entire complex is very well maintained and is tourist friendly.Angkor Thom is a \"Must See\" for anyone interested in ancient history and magnificent monuments"

Sadly, the jungle has reclaimed most of the city over time and very little remains to give an idea of the enormity of this place in its heyday.The main entrance is the imposing southern gate, jam packed with tourists, tuk tuks, busses and the occasional elephant. From there you take your favourite form of transport to the central point of Angkor Thom: the Bayon temple. This is a beautiful building with its maze of passageways and enigmatic faces looking down on you. Nearby is the Baphuon, with an enormous reclining budda carved into the back of the temple. This temple has been recently renovated, but was not open for tourists on our visit.A short walk away is the royal enclosure, where little remains of the former palace complex. Another short walk brings you to the Terrace of the leper king and elephant terrace, both interesting in their own way.Ankor Thom is in a more decayed state than Angkor Wat, and minimal restoration work seems to be taking place. This adds to its charm. This also means it's not covered in the ugly plastic tarps that marred Angkor Wat during our visit."

Toilets are usable but that's about it..Sunblock and bug repellent a must."

            "review": "Fascinating complex within Angkor. If you spend a few days in Siem Reap, then you will most likely also visit the temples of Angkor Thom. It is a bit less crowded than Angkor Wat and certainly best early morning or later during the day. Beware that at lunchtime the place gets really hot so don't go out without water and try to keep in the shade where possible.Angkor Thom has several temples to visit. Bayon is probably one of the most impressive once with its buddah faces on every site. Its also great for climbing a little bit - lots of stairs, so good if you are a bit in shape. We found it best to explore the temples by tuk-tuk - its cheap as well, just about 15-20 Dollars for the whole day. Really recommended."

I really had no idea how big the whole Angkor complex was and I think I will have to go back there - but no kids and no husband! I think a knowledgeable guide is a must - ours was great and he added to the whole experience. Looking at ruins is great, but knowing what they were for is even better. Give yourself plenty of time to really explore as there is just so much to see."

            "review": "Awesome Angkor Thom. This site is even bigger than Angkor Wat, in a walled compound surrounded by a 100 metre wide moat. The spell-binding Bayon temple which sits in the centre of Angkor Thom was probably the highlight of all the temples for us. It was the king's state temple and is absolutely captivating as it looks like something from another world. It has about 50 huge towers, each carved with 4 giant faces smiling in every direction. What the faces are supposed to represent is a matter of controversey, although the most popular theories are that they represent the compassionate Bodhisattva Loksvara, or that they're supposed to be a mixture of Buddha and King Jayavarman 7th (whose temple it was).Fortunately when we visited Angkor Thom was a lot less busy than Angkor Wat so we were able to wander around the maze of courtyards in peace. At Angkor Thom we also passed through the Terrace of the Elephants; a 300 metre long terrace wall decorated with, of course, lots of elephants, and opposite and parrallel to that the 12 towers of Prasat Suor Prat."

All of the sites in Angkor are truly incredible and otherworldy in their beauty, and to think of the labor that went into building them so many years ago. You read so much about Angkor Wat and it is the site to see when in Siem Reap. But I found Angkor Thom to be the most stunning place I visited on my trip. On the walk up you can hear the monks chanting and there are hundreds of butterflies everywhere. The light even on a sunny day is slightly muted and it all sets the scene for your first views of Angkor Thom. Words cannot describe and your pictures can't do justice to the magnitude of this place. It is stunningly beautiful and hypnotic. I highly recommend it is your first stop in Siem Reap."

If you want to just take it all in, spend hours at Bayon (faces are imposing but not threatening, a serene feeling here) and at the terrace of the Elephants. Relief work is incredible and more fun to decipher than the more religious reliefs."

            "review": "Be a savvy barang and do this yourself!. My wife & I are independant travellers who love doing things ourselves. We spent 4 nights in Siem Reap and tackled the Angkor Complex over 3 days as follows...First day we got into Siem Reap in the afternoon after a 6h bus ride from Phnom Penh ($11 pp and pretty comfortable). Once we had checked into our guest house (Golden Mango Inn), we headed to the old market in Siem Reap in search of a guide book. Depending on your haggling skills you could pick up one of the bootleg guides for 4 or 5$. The book we used as Ancient Angkor by Michael Freeman. It's a comprehensive book written by famous Angkor archeologists with loads of illustrations. Hire a guide if you want to but in my opinion for $20 per day you're not going to get your money's worth...plus while we were out there we actually heard some guides giving out wrong information to their tour groups. This is not based on info from the book but from my own personal knowledge of Hinduism. Next thing you gotta worry about is how to get to the complex. Our guest house provided free bikes and we cycled. Depending on where you're staying it could be between 5-7km to get to the complex and it gets really hot! Take lots of water with you, you'll need it! You can hire a tuk tuk for about 12$ a day from Siem Reap and is probably useful if you want to catch the early sunrises or you're visiting the complex at night.The 3day pass costs 40$ and this is what we did:Day 1 - Preah Kahn, Ta Keo, Ta Prohm, Banteay KdeiDay 2 - Phnom Bakheng, Angkor Wat, Banteay SreiDay 3 - Ankor Thom complex - gates, Bayon, Baphuon, Phimeanakas, Terraces of Elephants & Leper KingBayon we thought was the most magnificent of all and we're glad we did that right at the end. Kind of finishing on a climax...The view of Angkor Wat from Phnom Bakheng is ok, not something to rave about and sunset views are rubbish and you'll end up with loads of barangs (Khmer for foreigner) in your pics!Other thing to note is that there is constant restoration work at some of the temples so don't be disappointed if you can't access certain areas, c'est las vie!"

            "review": "Place to visit before or after the temples?. Went to the National Museum on the fourth day of our stay in Siem Reap. The museum has been around probably about a year because during our previous visit to Siem Reap in March 2007, it was still being built. I was initially of the view that visiting the museum towards the end of our trip gave us a 'summary' of all the temple sights we have benn to. As you will see, most of the statues at the sights have no heads, has missing inscribed tablets etc. In the museum, you will be able to 'place' the heads onto the missing bits. However, a friend of mine has a totally different perspective, which in hindsight, I agree i.e. that a visit to the museum first (before going on a temple frenzy) should be the right thing to do so that you get to put things in proper perspective when you go around each temple sight. There are different halls in the museum, each focussing on looking at the subject matter of Khemer civilisation, the Angkor temples, etc from different angles. For example, there is the Hall of a Thousand Buddhas containing a collection of statues of the Buddha only, from different times. Try to ask the attendant there or try to spot a particular statue in which the head, face and eyes \"turn\" and keep \"looking\" at you as you walk from side to side.Then there is a hall dedicated to the history of the Angkor temples. This is especially helpful if you are a history buff before embarking on your temple visits. Then there is a hall dedicated to the cultural aspect and the beliefs, which forms so much of the theme in the temples.We were absolutely delighted at the museum. One can see that there is a lot of effort put into it and it is situated in a purpose built building. Admission is USD12.00 for adults and it is within walking distance from the Sofitel. From Siem Reap town, a USD1 per person ride on a tuk tuk will bring you there. It is opened from 8 am to 8 pm and we had 2 hours in the museum, which was not enough time at all. They require that you leave your bags and camera at a designated counter, so if you have any expensive stuff with you, you may want to leave it at the hotel instead. We were there at around 5pm and to our surpise, we (3 of us) were the only ones there at the time. It may still be new and may yet to be mentioned in travel literature. Whatever the case may be, it is such a pity that there are not many visitors. We found it a wonderful place and a visit to Siem Reap will not be complete without a visit to the museum, either at the beginning or at the end of your trip, whichever way you view it."

            "review": "Superb Angkor holiday with Mr. Tee. My husband and I are Brits currently living in hot and humid Singapore. Last month his parents came out to visit us for a fortnight and we planned a week's side trip to off-season Cambodia, to see the temples of Angkor.We browsed various holiday websites and finally decided, through recommendations, to contact Mr. Tee (Sopheap Nhoep) at www.angkorholiday.blogspot.com. We were slightly bothered about trusting our deposit money to a stranger, but we needn't have worried - Mr. Tee looked after us royally.He got us a discounted booking for 6 nights at the Angkor Village Botanical Resort which was excellent for our needs; quiet, green, clean and very comfortable. He has a Toyota Camry for 2-3 passengers, and a van for larger parties of up to 6, which was what we had. We paid US$135 for 4 days of tours plus US$25 per day for an English-speaking tour guide. This included a nice touch of unlimited bottles of cold drinking water, very welcome after an hour in the hot sun looking at temples.It seemed to us that nearly everyone in Siem Reap is either a tour guide, or a driver who wants to be a tour guide! Mr. Tee is studying for his tour guide exams and hopes to qualify in a few months. His English is excellent and he already knows a lot about them so he shouldn't have much trouble. Meanwhile he uses qualified tour guides - ours was Chea Vanna (pronounced Wanna), a gentle, softly-spoken, very knowledgeable man.The temples are amazing. Over the first 3 days we saw 16 of them, and took nearly 2,500 photos between us! Many of these ancient \"lost\" temples are still being restored, some by teams from other countries like China and Japan. There were a few noisy coach-loads even in low season, but they couldn't destroy the feeling of spirituality in the intricately-carved stone-work.On day 4 we visited a floating village on Lake Tonle Sap, and at our request, the Sunrise Angkor Children\u2019s Village, an orphanage in Siem Reap. The children are educated with an emphasis on performing arts, and several have got to university. Some of the 74 children have lost their parents to land-mines. The rest have parents in jail or unable to care for them. These children are the lucky ones: many more are put to work selling tourist merchandise to supplement the family\u2019s income. Alcohol and drug abuse are a big problem.We arranged a free day in Siem Reap so that we could do our own thing. We ended up asking Mr. Tee to take us to visit a silk farm and the artisans\u2019 centre, both of which were very interesting. We gained a new respect for those silk goods and paintings, and the stone carvings and lacquered elephants, deities and temple views when we saw how long it takes the craftsmen and women to create them.In between all this culture, Mr. Tee took us to a selection of local eateries for lunches, so that we could sample the Khmer cuisine. Don't miss trying Amok, which is meat or fish cooked in a coconut, with each restaurant offering slightly different variations. I loved the \u201cpumpkin in oven\u201d with tuna from the Khmer Kitchen Restaurant in Siem Reap. It worked just as well in my oven at home!The US$ is accepted more widely than the Cambodian Riel, and in some places where we tried to pay in Riel we were quoted a very poor exchange rate. Had we known, we would only have brought US$.We loved Siem Reap and the Angkor temples. Not just for \u201cThat Tree\u201d in Tomb Raider, but for the knowledge that just by visiting we were helping a community that after nearly 30 years is still recovering from the effects of Khmer Rouge and the Pol Pot regime which lead to the deaths of a quarter of the Cambodian population. Apparently the unknown number of remaining landmines will gradually decompose and disarm themselves in 40 or 50 years. Meanwhile, a family of 2 senior citizens, 5 adults and 4 small children regards themselves as lucky to be able to live in the city in 3 rooms. They want their lovely country to grow and develop, and tourism is the second biggest earner for them. I would go back, and take my friends too."

With Over 1 million people it was the worlds largest city.  At the centre of the great city of Angkor lies the Bayon Temple. It has 52 towers with the huge serene faces of the Jayavarman VII. To the north is the great plaza adjoining 300 metre long Elephant terrace, which must have been a spectacular meeting place 800 years ago. Behind this are the ruins of the Royal Palace and the pyramid temple of Phiminakas At the rear of the plaza are 12 towers the Prasats Sour Prat. Tight rope walkers used to perform across what is now the road to the Victory Gate.The crowning glory is the huge dome of the Baphuon. This is under restoration at present and will be a spectacular sight when completed . The whole area is dotted with dozens of smaller temples all are of some interest"
