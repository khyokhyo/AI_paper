There is still a very local, laid-back feel in the neighborhood which sports many restaurants, cafes, bars and boutique shops. The area is connected to the rest of the city by subway through the Plaza Italia stop. Certainly all your needs for eating and drinking can be met here, but if you just want a bottle of wine, salami, cheese or water there are several little bodegas (convenience stores). Tip: the gelato at Tufic is Italian quality."

The park is very dog friendly and she was very happy about that. Once we worked out an appetite we took a stroll around the Plaza and read and examines the many menus and different types of cuisine they had to offer. Variety is the key word here, you wills find the asado with a modern twist, Mexican, Chilean, pizza places and so on. The are plenty of bars around, but the vibe was mellow not loud. I suggest the area for a night walk."

Soho once was \"built\" by artists and musicians and was quite an alternative lively place. Nowadays it just flooded with big brands like Diesel, Nike, Levis etc. But in Argentina these brands are much more expensive then in other countries. All local designers disappeared and the charming atmosphere of the neigbourhood vanished. Today the neighbourhood has a more exquisite touch and can't help but comes over very snobby."

It's about a 20 minute walk to either subway line to take you to interesting sights and other areas of Buenos Aires. Be careful of the sidewalks here and all over the city - they are uneven, missing chunks, and there are often holes that can break your ankle. Also watch for dog doo-doo on the sidewalks."

Soho is not really accepted by Portenos, it's all Palermo and then people started calling neighborhoods next to Palermo, palermo this Palermo that, to make Palermo even bigger. So when you tell the taxi one or the other, he will know but will snicker. Plaza Serrano is in this area of Soho and is a must do for first time and frequent visitors of BA. Great shops, Great street vendors and artists and super restaurants and cafes, you can easily spend a couple of days here. In fact, it's really great if you can stay in the area and do everything by foot, with the caveat that Palermo is happening and some hotels might be less soundproofed than others."

To get to this area from Florida Street where I was staying, I took a cab, which are cheap and readily available. The cab fare with tip was 150 Pesos, which made it 22 US dollars. For a 25 minute cab drive I did not feel this was bad. Once I got to this area, and upon completing my wine tasting, I took time to walk the neighborhood for awhile. It is not as commercial driven as Florida Street. I felt very safe, merchants and business both seemed appreciative of my being in this area. Sometimes, and some places, one can feel 'not so welcomed'. But that certainly was not the case here. I wish I would have been able to spend more time there in the daylight areas. It really seems like a great place."

In the day this is just another ordinary semi-elegant and semi-bohemian area of Buenos Aires, with its fashion stores on one hand and its pubs and restaurants getting ready for the week end nights on the other. At night the atmosphere changes, and here's where one half of Buenos Aires club-goers meet at night (the other half meets in Recoleta). Here you'll find an enless series of differently decorated bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants offering all possible drinks and foods - booth national and foreign. Food prices are reasonable compared to Western cities, but once you order any alcoholic drink which is not beer prices go uo just like in London, Paris or Rome."

The merchandise is rarely available outside of South America and excited all my girls immensely. They bought a lot of stuff and got many compliments on the pieces. If you (are a woman) and don't want to worry about showing up at an event with the same dress on as any other woman, buy one here and your odds are reduces significantly.

It is a very clean and well organized part of the city. There are people on the streets well into the night and so it felt very safe. We had so many restaurants to choose from in this part of the city. We could walk everywhere from our hotel and find an outstanding restaurant. Also, I was there for a tango workshop, and there were several milongas within walking distance from the hotel. Also, it was very easy to hail a taxi in this part of town. I highly recommend Palermo Soho."

The shops of full of elegant wear, and each store seems to outdo the next for store design. You can find this kind of upscale store design at some 5th Ave shops in Manhattan, but it's not just window dressing here, it's the whole store that has been designed out. One shop after another. Really gorgeous. And if you want to eat during the day there are loads of cafes, pizzerias, and restaurants, particularly around the Plazza Armenia, the center of Soho. There are also lots of very trendy art galleries. The time to really go is at night, when Palermo Soho comes really lively with outdoor restaurants and cafes. A very fun experience.

A little nostalgia of the 70's, like coming home, walking, after having been to Woodstock ... Something like that. Probably, if you go in the evenings or during weekends, the feeling would be different and much more appealing. One last remark: If you are going or coming back by taxi, ask help for calling a radio taxi whenever possible. Argentinean cab drivers are not at all reliable, always ready to rob you. Pay cash in low denomination notes (AR$ 10 or AR$ 20) and keep your eyes wide open! Any problem, call the police! Give Palermo Soho a try! Enjoy!"

Before, there is nothing open although you can have lunch in a nice restaurante until shops open. You will find here the same stores that you find on a shopping mall, plus some very local designers -being them the most interesting to be seen-.Very nice ambiance, lots of people walking and draging around. Absolultely a place to visit"

I prefer the first one to the second one. Be ready to walk around many streets that have plenty of restaurants, bars and galleries among others. There are some streets that have more flow-environment than others. In my opinion mostly the nice area is located between Av Santa Fe and Av. Cordoba and Av Dorrego and Julian Alvarez. Streets with old rock bricks (or which look like) tend to be most populars (Ejem Costa Rica). Plaza Cortaza is a good start and has a street market during a few days of the week. Also for some reason the further away you walk from the Av. Santa Fe the nicer it gets. For some reason pet excrements and garbage are frequently found on the street close to this Av Santa Fe. On a different note, we did not encounter any unpleasant situation of any kind but you will also find a lot of homeless walking around as sun sets in this area. Enjoy your walk.jr"

You will notice that the blocks are smaller than elsewhere in the city, and the working class folk were able at one time to be able to afford a home at last. The plaza known as plaza Serrano ( actually plazeta Julio Cort\u00e1zar) was once the local fresh produce market. As the neighbourhood became gentrified, it slowly changed to include more and more bars, restaurants and boutique shops to eventually become known as SOHO.

Palermo soho is kind of like what NYC soho/village used to look and feel like. Lots of little boutique shops, larger Argentinian brand names and restaurants to have a coffee, tirada (draft beer) or meal. There's a market at plaza Serrano and another one in another plaza nearby with handmade items. They used to only be there on weekends but I think now it's a permanent fixture. All in all you'll find something to do and can spend an enjoyable afternoon or evening here."

If they decide one isn't intending to spend a lot, one gets ostracised straightaway or sent to a far end table in an empty restaurant or cafe. I guess the area is victim of its own success."

The barrio is plentiful with good restaurants covering a broad range of cuisine and prices. There are number of fine small stores which specialize in unique leather goods and clothes. For example, my wife discovered a number of beautifully made purses at very reasonable prices. We always revisit these shops, as we did today, to investigate their new offerings. This barrio is well worth staying at and spending a day or two investigating while visiting BsAs."

Specially at Sundays, when there are some artisans shops openned and the place get really alive, Palermo Soho is a great place to walk by, sit at some bars to have beers or wine (you can also choose just one charming place to spend the whole night). The artisans shops give the place a cool atmosphere and you can find some great things to buy at very good price (women accessories, paintings, clothes). There are pubs, italian restaurants, charming restaurants with many food options. I recomend Sheldon, at Plaza Serrano: amazing ambience with jazz shows, good wine and reasonable price."

There are quite a few nice coffee houses serving light lunches and afternoon cakes, sandwiches and salads. There are weekend open air markets that bring out crafts people with local made crafts. We stayed in a boutique hotel in Palermo Soho making it very convenient to enjoy this upbeat neighborhood. One caveat, the action does not really take off until at least the early afternoon at lunch time, since most shops do not open early. Most stay open late, making the area full of life late into the evening. The area is accessible by subway and bus. Due to the people out and about, the area is very safe."

Portenios seem to love dogs and you'll see people walking them a lot, but having said this, I felt the streets were filled with flees or something! Streets are bit dirty and smelly and you'll need to watch out for the water dropping off the air conditioners if you visit in summer."

The stores and cafes in Palmero Soho definitely have a hip, young vibe, but the neighborhood is great no matter what your age. It's a good place to hang out, and Palmero is the largest barrio in BA, so there are more Portenos than tourists at least when we were there in April that was true, which was also nice. We visited Palmero Soho, Hollywood, Recoleta, San Telmo, La Boca, and Puerto Madera and found them to all be great in their own ways. Buenos Aires is a vibrant, friendly city."

Soho Palermo is easy to get to by bus from the main city, the number 59 stops at Plaza Italia or the number 39 stops on Costa Rica Avenue in the heart of the Soho district. You can also get the the Green line, D, Subte train to Plaza Italia. The area is really quaint and charming with lots of small unique boutiques, trendy shops, books shops and it seems a cafe, bar or restaurant on every corner.

Imagine how surprised I was when I was suddenly grabbed from behind in broad daylight on a busy street, thrown to the ground and had my watch ripped off my wrist. My friend got her head bonked when she tried to get the guy off my back and tore his shirt. He was brought down by a group of angry citizens a block away. A very kind film actor by the name of Gerardo Romano happened to be a witness and helped us and protected the robber from the lynch mob.With only four hours before we had to leave for the airport for our flight home, the police detained us in an endless process. One cop slipped my watch into his pocket. I took a picture of him and called him on it.Without the actor's help we would never have been allowed to leave. We were then chased down the street by the press when we were finally allowed to leave. I have followed the media reports and learned the guy was released from jail after 12 hours and that he had already been involved in 3 crimes in the area, one at gun point. There is a lot of outrage among the population about the lack of crime control in the city. They tried to pick pocket my husband in a restroom by spraying his shirt with some gunk and pretending to \"help!\" So, great city, wonderful people, but I am not sure there is even a basic level of safety."

My husband and I travelled to Buenos Aires with every intention of staying in Palermo Soho after reading all the glowing reviews about its great restaurants, nightlife and fantastic sophisticated shopping. After spending the first evening there, we had our reservations. We were dropped off at the main square, which was crowded and blaring techo music from several seedy tourist traps within earshot. There was a market in the middle of the square, which was a pretty poor effort compared to the Recoleta and San Telmo markets. We ate an an OK restaurant that had a tourist oriented menu and browsed the shops before returning to our hotel in Recoleta. Underwhelmed, but determined to give the area a second chance, we returned the next day with a plan to walk the neighborhood, have a lunch in one of the cafes on the square and find a nice boutique hotel. After strolling down and around Honduras, criss-crossing through block after block of run down, dirty buildings with seedy looking bars, and a couple of hip looking restaurants interspersed, we figured we had lost our way, so we asked for some directions. Turns out we were smack dab in the middle of this \"hip, urban neighborhood that is just like NY's Soho\". Well, I used to live in Soho and guess what? Palermo Soho is its ugly stepchild at best. To top things off, we stopped for lunch on the main square and browsing the overpriced, poor quality clothing shops nearby. We remarked that we felt as if we were being followed. When we sat down for lunch we were immediately accosted by old women and children shoving their wares in your face. My husband pulled out his IPad and immediately there were a flock of vultures bearing down on us. I saw a guy stroll up behind him very close to our table, so I grabbed the IPad and stuck it in my lap. Next thing you know, another guy comes up behind me, grabs my arm and rips my watch off. He ran down the street with my husband in pursuit only to jump on the back of the motorcycle and speed off. Mind you, this was in BROAD DAYLIGHT in the middle of the biggest square in the town. After he escaped, everyone around us just shrugged and went back to what they were doing. I asked about the police and a man in the restaurant laughed and said that they never come around Palermo and this sort of thing happens all the time. We left one very nice watch lighter, but having saved an IPad so I guess we were considered lucky. Bottom line: This area does not live up to the tour guide hype. Tourists are bait and the locals don't care. New York's Soho ought to sue them for sullying the name."

Our hotel had recommended it as a good place to go, as we were staying in Palermo. We could see all the places where there were DJs in the evening, and notices up about deals including beer and empanadas and other things like that. We were too tired to come back in the evening, but if we had been 20 years younger, we definitely would have. Building works in the centre of the square were a bit annoying while we were there, but they are probably finished by now."

The whole place now looks like one big tourist trap. However, the restaurants on the north side from Fitz Roy to Dorrego are VERY GOOD. Also that area has not been as \"Americanized\" as the area from Uriarte to Bulnes. Go to El Trapiche on Paraguay for a great parilla or Cafe 22 on Fitz Roy...or if you really want to remember what life in Buenos Airrs used to be like \"Las Cabras\" on Fitz Roy."

Palermo Soho is crowded with boutiques, which from walking around seems to cater about 75% to women. The area is crowded with restaurants of every type with concentrations around squares/parks like Palermo Viejo. Cafe life is alive and very strong in this area. I think its reasonably safe during the day; though at night the area immediately near the tracks seperating Palermo Soho from Palermo Hollywood, seems a bit more dodgy. The area is also filled with a variety of boutique hotels. so between locals, schools, butchers, bakeries, restaurants,and artisans, its a very interesting area.My biggest dislike in this area was dodging [--] on the side walks.It's horribly disgusting as the porteno's seem to be big dog lovers; but not everyone carries a pooper scooper.The other big downside of the area is the noise at night. Folks go out to eat very late here and as a result traffic and other noise levels are high much later."

The best stores are in the 500-700 block. If you pay cash they'll give you a discount, usually.Visited Spring 2009"

It's vibrant, full of fashionable shops, nice restaurants, places for breakfast, bars, street markets. San Telmo also has this, but first of all it's much smaller, it's not so alive, it's more touristic (bc it's smaller), and the shops are more antique shops (which I don't like). In my opinion, Palermo Soho is the place to stay :)"

Its a great area - huge number of small cool and unusual boutiques mixed in with trendy cafes that wouldn't be out of place in Barcelona or indeed NYC Soho. I ended up getting leggings hand printed with images inspired by movies (!), some very beautiful soap shaped like rose petals, and a silk tunic from the designer Garza Lobos. Lunch at Felicidad was great, too. Tip: go to plaza serrano and then go East and North - almost all the stores are in that area (it would be easy to miss)"

I found this market to be very reasonably priced overall. Also a great place to bring a book and read or people watch!"

Or forget walking and sit down in one of the many cafes, restaurants or bars. For free entertainment sit in Plaza Armenia. We people watched while listening to a group of drummers.

Dodging dog poop everywhere also makes it less than enjoyable to stroll through the streets and check out the restaurants and shops (why doesn't anyone seem to care in any of the residential areas of the city?!) Yet there is clearly lots of potential for a good time in this area and it gets very lively when the weather warms up. If you find it too trendy here, just head on over to the other side of the tracks to Palermo Hollywood where there is a fair share of good restaurants as well.If you've had your fill of Recoleta and the main tourist areas, it is worth a visit to get another slice of Porteno life. Super-easy to get to with buses and Subte D from downtown area."

We have rented in dffferent parts and this past May we stayed about block and half from Plaza Serrano. I have always gone there on the weekends as one can pick up some very nice items at reasonable prices. This time I bought a well made leather messenger bag for under $50 US.Also only on weekends on streets off Plaza Serrano, there will be something which I call flash shops selling clothing, shoes, accessories by local designers. You can get some good deals but need to be careful in examining for quality .These places can get very crowded and chaotic but that is part of the experience. I love to just stroll around and pop in and out of shops. Mama Racha is a great place to have breakfast or lunch on the patio and people watch. Mark's is good for coffee and one can do WiFi there as long as you like if not a busy time."

One method that works rather well is to forget the term and head for Plaza Serrano, which is a straight shot down Jorge Luis Borges street from Plaza Italia. Once there you can know you are in the center of the Soho area. Take in the many cool bars, cafes, nightclubs, and parrillas and absorb the ethereal ambience of 'Soho-ness'. Proceed in any direction, examine the boutique-like shops, make sure to sit down for something. If you keep walking, eventually the surrounding feeling will wear off into a subdued normality and you will know that you have left Soho behind. I have often found that turning around it has disappeared altogether."
