They are very professional but the whole experience was also very comfortable and homey. The school is in their beautiful family compound. They took time to explain not just food but culture and tradition of Bali too. The food we made was all fresh, slow cooked, healthy and yummy! Definitely recommend this to people not just interested in food and cooking but also anyone interested in learning more about Balinese life. Thank u Lobong. :)"

You'll learn so much about the Balinese way of life, which will hold you in good stead whilst wandering the streets of Bali. You get to create & eat some fantastic food which can be downed with ice cold Bintangs all for a very reasonable price."

The morning started with a trip to a local, non-touristic food market where we learned about Balinese fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices with Sang Made, the family host. Sang speaks English quite well and is very personable. Then we went back to the compound for refreshments and a lesson in family life within the compound. Chef Dewa then took over for the cooking instruction. We prepared a three course meal with 7 dishes. Preparation was fun and the food delicious. Prior to our sitting down to eat, we were taught about, then watched the ceremony for the food in the temple within the compound. My wife and I do cooking classes everywhere we travel as it is a wonderful way to learn the culture. We would rate Lobong among the top schools we have attended. Highly recommended as it is not just a cooking school but an education."

Very easy to book via telephone or email. The host Sang and the chef Dewa are professional and will make you feel at home. The cooking class begins with a morning tour to the local market where you will get familiarised with the local produce. A must visit. Then you are taken to their house for cooking. The house itself is a typical Balinese house and the host will tell you lot of their style of living. The cooking class is a big fun and chef Dewa is helping everybody. Special thanks to the chef Dewa. Strictly recommend this cooking class, and the food is delicious."

There's a reason this company had hundreds and hundreds of five star reviews. From the early morning pickup to the information local market tour to the actual techniques explained during the class, this is a truly well-oiled professional experience. Everything about this class flowed so well. The spices we touched and smelled in the market were exactly what our recipes consisted of, which seems simple, but is a really great tie in when you are new to an entire cuisine. This is quite a long day, but when I found myself getting thirsty, tea or a iced drink would appear. The family was more than happy to answer all of the hundred or so questions our group offered up over the course of the day. We learned a ton and left happy and full, thanks to the delicious luncheon you get to enjoy as the fruits of your labor. Vegetarians, definitely book this class. I did a lot of research before I booked and this class was seamlessly accommodating. I worked with tofu and tempeh whilst everyone else worked with chicken and it didn't impact things at all. The market didn't really have meat for sale at the late time of day (9:30am) that we visited with the class, I think that's a first thing in the morning product. Without a doubt, this was one of the best things we did during our two week honeymoon in Bali!Small tip - where close-toed shoes to the market. It had rained the night before and I was really glad I had shoes on as the market you visit (especially after a rainy night) has some puddles."

I felt so accomplished as a chef cooking real food from Bali. The smells to this day are still dancing in my head, I have bought cook books and I am watching videos on you tube to refresh my memory and doing a good job- except for the rice, its a work in progress. I recommend that everyone who visit Bali take this class because there is nothing better than cooking an authentic meal for yourself that tastes as good as it does from a restaurant. The trip through the market was the best experience for me because i was swimming in the spices and ingredients the scream Bali. And I got to shop like a local. I have looked at my food as a religious act after this experience because the people of Bali pay respect for all of the life that was given so that I can live. I made it a point to return to Bali next year with my family and the first thing we will all do is the Lobong Culinary Experience."

They picked me up at the hotel and then we went for a tour of a local market (no tourists there). Got introduced to the main ingredients for balinese cooking, learnt a lot of interesting things about local products/produce. After that, we head out to the family compound where we were greeted with coffee/tea and banana fritters (delicious). We were introduced to the life of a balinese family with great detail before beginning our cooking class. The \"teacher\" is a restaurant trained chef and he shared lots of details about what balinese food is all about. We got to get our hands dirty and managed to produce a lovely meal (starters, main & dessert).Before serving the meal we had a small presentation on the offerings you can see everywhere in Bali and even got to see the whole ceremonial process.Upon leaving we received the book with all the recipees and a bottle of home made coconut oil.This is much, much more than a culinary experience. Not to miss!When coming back to Bali, for sure I will book it again ;)Thank you for a lovely day!Adina"

The market tour was great because it was not a tourist dominated market, the tour and explanation of the family compound along with explaining and setting out the offerings was enlightening, and learning about all the ingredients and cooking techniques was very interesting. It was pretty hands on and we got a delicious meal out of it too. A nice way to spend a day."

We went today and I don't normally jump straight on to leave reviews, but this deserves a top rating. Easy to organise, speedy responses via email to make arrangements and we were picked up on time from our hotel. We loved the market visit, there were no other tourists and our guide shared so many insights and traditions - it was the first time we really came to understand the Bali way of life. Then it was back to the family compound for more insights into the family, the community and culture before 2 hours of hands on cooking and eating together. The food was delicious and we got the recipes to take away to try at home. I will be recommending Lobong to all of our friends heading to Bali."

Pickup was exactly on time, took us to a village market with no other tourists, welcomed us to their beautiful family compound and served us delicious fried bananas and coffee/tea. The cooking class was obviously the highlight - our instructor made sure to explain lots of details to us and get everyone involved in the cooking. After two hours of chopping and stirring, we followed the family matriarch into the compound's temple to make an offering before sitting down to eat. The food was amazing, and on top of that, an extra treat was a little recipe book and bottle of coconut oil presented to us at the end. Lovely addition to any Ubud trip!"

Our group were the only tourists there, since this was a marked used by balinese, which made it even more special.He guided us through the marked and explained the different spices used in balinese cuisine, along with fruits and vegetables. After a very interesting morning we were taken to their home, were also the cooking class was arranged.This was really something special and we didn't just learn how to cook a delicious balinese meal, but also a lot about balinese culture, religion and family traditions.This is really worth it and I would recommend it to everyone who travels to Ubud!"

Had a try of some local fruits and learnt about different spices and other unfamiliar things. Then onto the family compound where we had an overview of the family structure in Bali and about all those temples. After a coffee and morning tea, we got stuck into the cooking class. In total, we prepared 7 dishes which were served up as three meals. Just prior to eating, the grandmother of the family made offerings to the shrines and her son explained to us how, why and when the offerings were made. After our extremely delicious meal, we received a recipe booklet and homemade coconut oil and rolled back to our hotel. So much fun, really interesting and delicious!"

The best thing though was just immersing ourselves in Balinese culture - learning about how families live, traditions with offerings - we just learned so much and it really added to the rest of our holiday as we understood so much more about the country.

I have visited Bali many times, and as I do on most vacations, I like to take a cooking class to learn about the local ingredients and methods of preparation. Usually I arrange a half day through a hotel. On this particular visit, I decided that it would be a nice change to experience a local business approach to cuisine. I booked Lobong after reading many excellent reviews. I was surprised and delighted at every turn. The group of 12 was a mix from all over the world - such great observations and comments based on varied backgrounds. Sunday, our guide, was an incredible storyteller. His knowledge of history, the culture, ingredients... all outstanding. After the market, we went to his family home, a compound that was beautiful. The entire family is involved in the business and how fantastic it was to spend the morning immersed in Balinese culture. If I could recommend one activity in Ubud, it would be Lobong. Regardless of your cooking sophistication or understanding of Balinese culture, you will learn more during these 4 hours than you can imagine. Truly a great experience - thank you!"

The trips begins with a insightful tour around a locals food market, experiencing new fruits, spices and vegetables, learning what they are called,how they are grown and what they are used for. Ask as many questions as possible to get the most out of this opportunity to learn. After the market you are taken to their family compound where the true teachings begin.

It was a most enjoyable morning and the food was very tasty too, we finished up around 2pm. I would recommend to anyone; no matter what level of cooking skills they may have."

It was hands on and well communicated with a yummy feast at the end. I would recommend this to anyone."

What a fantastic day and experience we had today.First we were picked up by Sang at our hotel and driven to a market in Ubud.There we were met by Sangs brother Sunday who showed us around the market to show us ingredients we were using to cook. He was extremely knowledgable about all aspects of market and culture.From there we were driven to family compound and where we were shown around and learnt about how the family lived. We then met Dewa who was our chef. Dewa then explained what we were cooking and from then on everything was hands on.We cooked a 3 course Balinese meal and was very interesting an enjoyable to eat .I would thoroughly recommend any anyone travelling to Bali to go and experience this cooking class as very professionally run very informative and they make u feel very much part of family"

I reviewed several cooking courses, until I found one that had a menu I knew I would be able to find the ingredients for at home, and also a menu I was confident I could tackle at home.I wasn't disappointed, our teacher gave us alternatives for ingredients that are not easily found at home. The recipes were typical Balinese fare and \"do able\".The experience rfrom being picked up from my hotel was warm, comfortable and friendly, right until our drop off at the day's end. The market tour was informative and interesting. The chance to ask questions and view a family compound was also extremely interesting. The whole family seemed involved and everyone spoke perfect English. Our teacher involved everyone in the menu, and everything was made by the students. The end result was served to us in a beautiful dining area in the middle of the garden compound.You don't have to be a \"Master Chef\". If you can chop, grind and stir, you can do this course. The cook book given to you at the courses finish is also easy to follow. We had couples, small group of friends, and me (solo). The group was supportive, interesting and fun.I would highly recommend this tour."

We were also very impressed by how well they catered for my partner who is vegetarian. The vegetarian was by no means second best to the chicken but equally thought out and delicious.

Definitely a highlight of our trip and I'm looking forward to making the dishes again at home. It was great to see the market and be educated about Balinese food. While we were at the market I did get really upset about the welfare of the chickens (it was pretty poor) and so I was really relieved and grateful when our chef explained that they source their chickens from a higher welfare place. The cooking was really fun and a good balance of doing lots of the cooking ourselves but with some shortcuts and help from the staff so that we were not cooking all day. A great day and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting Ubud."

The structure of the family and compound was well explained, I felt priviledged to be welcomed into the compound. The trained chef took us through all elements of preparation and cooking our delicious , authentic food. After an offering( once again, all parts explained fully) by the Guides mother on our behalf, we were served our food that we had cooked, restaurant style.

You start out with a top knotch tour of a market outside of Ubud and they provide so much information about the ingredients and foods that make up Balinese cuisine. After the market to you are taken to their home and then the real fun begins.The cooking space is imbeciably clean and so very well organized. The chef that teaches the class is internationally trained and an expert in Balinese food. The instructions are so helpful and they provide small tips and offer substitutions if we can't find a certain ingredient at home.At the end of it all you get to sit down with the rest of your class and enjoy the meal you have just prepared. The take away booklet with the recipes is clear and I've been able to make many of these items at home with no problem. They also have some of the Balinese mortar and pestles available for sale and I picked up one of these which has proven to be one of my favourite kitchen tools.This is one of many cooking classes available in Ubud but I really think this is the best one.

I was picked up punctually from my hotel (7.45 a.m.) and, together with a few other guests, taken to the local market where Made, the organiser of the school, was waiting for us with the rest of the people I'd be learning to cook with that day (there was 10 of us that day and Made told us the max. of people they take per day is 12 which is a good number). Made took us around the local market which was a brilliant experience in itself. We were the only Westerners there and were told lots about various spices and fruits and could even try some. An hour later we were taken to the Lobong family compound where Made told us about traditional Balinese family life (fascinating, as it was all completely new to me!) and answered any questions we had. We were then given either some coffee or ginger tea and banana fritters before Made introduced us to Dewa (spelling?), the very experienced chef who taught us various dishes. We learned how to cook rice the traditional way and cooked 8 dishes that morning. Dewa explained everything step by step, got us to chop the spices and always used 1-2 people from our group to follow his instructions, so that everybody got involved in things. Once we'd finished all the dishes, Made's mother did the traditional food offerings to the gods - a ritual that was so interesting to witness!After that we were served all the dishes we'd cooked - oh, it all tasted divine!!Afterwards we were presented with a little bag which contained a booklet with the recipes we'd cooked that day and a small bottle of coconut oil. Then we were driven back to our accommodation. I was back in my hotel at 2.30 p.m.All in all, it was a fantastic experience! Made speaks excellent English, as does Dewa. The compound is beautiful, and they take hygiene extremely serious, which I was so glad about. I cannot wait to try the dishes at home :)I highly recommend this cooking class to anybody visiting Bali!!!"

We started with local market (completely different from those Ubud tourist markets). Mr. Sunny explained us so much about all the spices, herbs. If you need anything for really cheap price take from there (Sunny helped us to bargain the price - tobacco, vanilla...). Later they welcomed us to their family compound with a cup of local tea/coffee and fried bananas, explained about family live, traditions. Then the cooking class started, everything was so carefully prepared with so many helpers so you can concentrate on the chef\u00b4s explanations and cooking.

From the very start being picked up from your hotel (thank you Nata) and then taken to your traditional fresh produce market to be shown how the Balinese do it by our very knowledgeable guide Sunday (sorry if the spelling is incorrect) who not only showed us all the different types of spices, fruits, and food but explained and showed the traditional way of life. We learnt a lot about Balinese compound life.... So interesting!!! And beautiful!! Taken back to the family compound we were met by Dewa!!! And boy this chef can turn anyone into a Chef in a matter of hours!!! Our menu included entre, mains and dessert!! All made by YOURSELF!! Fresh aromatic ingredients!!! Not only do you get to eat what you cook (loved all of it couldn't choose a favourite!) but you also get to experience offering to the ancestors and gods (they were very thoughtful to ask if you were ok with it NEVER forced, totally up to you!) If you have any allergies just let them know (bookings are essential and super easy.. Just email them!) and they will cater to your needs! Such an awesome experience! Well done Lobong!!"

            "review": "More than just a cooking class!. We first went to a local market outside of Ubud which catered mainly for the local neighbourhood, not tourists. Having said that, our colourful guide who spoek excellent English explained the difference between hot (small, red & very strong) and what they call \"tourist\" (big, sweet and not hot at all) peppers! He was an excellent communicator and knew the market and stallholders. I bought a kilo of the best local red rice for just 20,000 to take home, and learnt alot about herbs & spices. Then we went to the family compound where the cooking class was held. A really informative talk about Hindu culture ensued (why the house for the eldest family member is in the north and why the family temple on site was in the north-east corner) The art, architecture and fmaily practices were fascinating. The class instructor was great - he knew so much about all kinds of cooking, having worked in a big hotel before (His favourite snack was pasta he made for himself!) and he had a good sense of humour and engaging manner. We were lucky to be in a class of just 6 people, so alot of hands on work, followed by a most enjoyable lunch. The steamed rice & sweet potatoe and the chicken satay were delicious. We departed with a cute little recipe book, a gift of 100ml of pure coconut oil, a satisfied palette and lovely memories."

The Lobong Culinary Experience is fantastic value for money - it includes a market tour with your guide Sunday who can explain all of the ingredients and also how the market works. Following the tour, and some delicious tea and sweet snacks, the cooking class takes place at his family compound, where his brother-in-law (who is a chef) is your instructor for the class. Before lunch, there is the opportunity to watch Sunday's mum making offerings at the family temple with the food you've cooked (she'll wrao you up in a sarong so you can enter the temple with her). So a real insight into Balinese family life as well as Balinese food. The lunch you cook is delicious, and there's plenty of it. They even give you some coconut oil and a little recipe book so you can replicate the dishes when you get home (I'll give it a try!).Thanks everyone at Lobong!"

I am so thankful to Sang Made's family for this wonderful moment. We arrived in the evening the day before to Ubud and I called to book cooking class, even tough it was already late, we were positively attended and Made was waiting for us the next day to pick us up at the hotel.The tour of the local market was an unique experience, back to their home, we were offered tea, coffee and fried bananas while Made was enlighting us with balinese culture, traditions, way of life...Then, we started the cooking, it was so entertaining that it went so fast. All together we were a group of 12 person from all over the globe, so cheerful to share together this experience. All the techniques given by the chief and the kindness of the staff really made this moment special.Once everything was finalized, we were able to share with the mother of Made the offering to the temple house before eating all the dishes we had prepared. It was so delicious!!! Best food ever in Ubud.Thanks to the whole family and staff for this wonderful experience which I more than strongly recommend! Suitable for vegans offering, toffu/fish alternatives."

We were collected from outside the Ubud Palace at 8:00 a.m. this morning, driven to Lobong and then to the market, where we were taken round by Sang who explained all the fruit and vegetables and what they are used for. We were then driven back to Lobong, a truly beautiful family compound, given coffee, tea and fried bananas. Sang explained his culture to us and we really appreciated his time and friendliness.We then met Dewa, the chef, and his helpers. Dewa made it so interesting and it really was 'hands on'. We cooked numerous dishes and I loved every minute of it!When the lunch was prepared, we were taken to the family temple where Sang's mother made the offerings. We were then seated at a beautifully set table, where we ate what we'd cooked, finishing with black rice porridge, which I thoroughly recommend.I would recommend the Lobong Culinary Experience, without reservation, to anyone who has an interest in food and/or the Hindu culture."

It isn't easy as a tourist to experience so much culture without expert guidance and that's what we got from the Lobong Cooking Class. Sangde (Sunday to us) gave a great tour of the traditional market with impeccable English and a jovial attitude. He was also the expert at Balinese culture and taught us so much about the lifestyle, culture and religion of Bali and in his own home compound. Then his brother the magnificent chef took over. Cooking is very much a part of the family experience, but this was not average home cooking. Our creations tasted like they'd been made at a 5 star resort. What a feast! Can we recreate this at home??? The souvenir cookbook will get us close, at least! Thanks, Lobong Culinary Experience!"

This was one of the activities that we did. It has filled our minds with lovely memories. We were picked up from our hotel. As part of the experience we were taken through a traditional market which was an experience in itself. We were also shown a traditional balinese family compound. The cooking school is located on the grounds of the owners family compound. It is very clean and shaded, with fans to keep you cool. We made some lovely dishes there, preparing and cooking them. Once all the food was made we sat down for our feast to try everything we had just made. It took about 5-6hours in total from memory (it was back in May that we went). Lovely little touches like giving us cold water and towels. All in all a great experience that I would recommend to anyone that is visiting Ubud."

The cooking was lovely, the staff are all very competent with English and eager to answer all your questions. I asked about alternative methods of cooking chicken instead of barbecuing as England doesn't really permit the weather for that (haha!) and they were very keen and quick to give me other methods (use cast iron in the oven). All in all, the meal was lovely to eat after all our hard work and the little book of information was a great touch at the end. Everyone definitely needs to do this!

There were 12 people on the cooking course and everybody was involved equally in the cooking. The end result was delicious, lots of tasty dishes served up at the end for a tasty feast.

To be honest the top three have good reviews on the whole, however, I ended up choosing Lobong, and although they are (or were at the time of choosing) #3, they definitely offer a #1 service!My wife and I were collected promptly at around 7.50am on the chosen morning, and along with another guest driven around 25 minutes to a local market. NOT I will add, to Ubud market, which is just full of tourist junk, but an actual, local market. We were the only non Balinese there. We were a group of 9, so not too big, and were shown around by one of the brothers who runs the class.His English was brilliant, and he explained everything very well and showed us all the spices and root ingredients that are such an integral part of Balinese cooking. It was very insightful and at no point felt like we were just following someone around, it was informative and interactive. A great start to the day. From here we were driven to the family compound in which they live, and given a tour of where, and more importantly, how they live. We were told about the family history and the cultural side of how Balinese families live. Again, it was very informative and educational. The class itself was very good. Run by another brother, he too was very good, good English, and very helpful throughout. We learnt all about how to use the spices and the methods of cooking the multiple dishes that we made. Everyone played a part in the class and everyone had vital input to the finished product. It was well run and everyone clearly had a great time and enjoyed it thoroughly. Before sitting down to eat, we all experienced a big part of Balinese culture, and that is the offerings. It was a very nice touch, and gave the whole experience a very Balinese feel. We sat down to eat around 1pm, and by this time were all starving and looking forward to eating everything we had just prepared, and that we did. A nice cold beer to accompany the multiple dishes we had created. The food was lovely, the family were lovely and the experience as a whole was exceptional. They even give you a parting gift, a small book of the recipes and ingredients for the menu we had made, and also a bottle of coconut oil. Just another nice touch, from a very nice and well run family business. I'd be surprised if Lobong don't make it to #1 on trip advisor, they provide an excellent service from start to finish and we couldn't recommend highly enough."

I can't say enough great things about this experience but here's a few:Market tour: EPIC, I even bought some vanilla there and we tried a few fruits and got to see all the spices Balinese people use to cook with The Mang family compound: Stunning! We got a run down of the history of their home and how Balinese people live and their customsThe cooking class: Led by a skilled chef and very experienced! It's very interactive and for people of all walks of life. The food we made was amazing and true to Balinese cusineThe family temple: you get to learn about the offerings and the meaning behind this ritual and also be apart of it! It's very beautiful!Eating: after the ritual we ate what we prepared! It was the BEST meal I had in Ubud and we were given a lovely parting gift afterwards with the recipe book! I LOVED this and would recommend it to All!"

They started the class out at a local market, explaining all of the main ingredients used in traditional Balinese cooking. Then we headed to a family compound and started cooking. We made several dishes and they all turned out absolutely delicious, some of the best food we had while in Bali. Everyone was very helpful and explained everything. I would definitely recommend this for anyone staying in Ubud; it was a great experience."

After pick up they take you to local market, usually you are only tourist there so is pretty cool. Guide explains all about local spices and prices etc. After your market you go to their house, you have opportunity to meet family and understand more about Balinese family compound. Everyone is very friendly and answer all your questions. You are welcomed with tea/coffee and fried banana. After introduction cooking start. Groups are around 10people, there is space for everyone to chop etc. an experience usually finish around 2 pm, after lunch where we all eat what we prepared. We both really enjoy this experience."

That made me a bit concerned about their professionalism, but those fears were unfounded. This was a great experience for everyone in the family from our 12yo boy to my 84yo mother. The class was impeccably run and a completely smooth operation (no small feat given the breadth of experience in the class and the number of dishes we prepared). The food was delicious, and there were enough dishes that there is sure to be one that will be pleasing to your whole group. The dishes will take some effort to recreate in the US, but doable. The best thing about the class was the fact that it is done in their family compound. This, combined with the trip to their local (and non-touristy) market made this more of a cultural experience than just a simple cooking class. The day started with a hotel pickup at 7:50 AM. We were back to the hotel by about 3PM. Well worth every penny and every minute."

We had a GREAT experience with Lobong; it had everything we were looking for: started with a super detailed and interesting tour of an authentic market that had ZERO tourists, moved to a real family compound (of the owners, not staged for tourists) where we learned about the family and religious traditions, then spent hours cooking a Balinese meal with and learning all about the process from a chef who was at the Amandari for TWENTY TWO YEARS, and finished by eating the goodness we cooked! Class size limited to 12 (we had 10) and lasted 8:30am to 2:30pm. All cooking was interactive with the expert chef, who was very focused on enabling us to bring the Balinese cooking tradition back to our home in the U.S. -- this is not just a demonstration of something you'll never be able to replicate, but rather a true course of a dish that we're excited to try for our next dinner party. Gifts of coconut oil and a recipe book followed the class. For less than $30 USD (475k IDR) per person (including all taxes/fees), this was a steal. Highly recommended!"

The Lobong Culinary Experience did not disappoint & blew away our expectations. Starting the morning with a guided tour around a local market introducing you to local products was a warm up for what we would be cooking with. A quick van ride took us to the family compound where we were welcomed. We were shown the basic layout of the compound & the meaning behind the set up. A coffee & tea break before starting our 2 hour prep & cooking session. The three course traditional Balinese menu was explained in detail, as was every step through out the day. A fantastic set up to ensure everyone had space to chop, cook & take photos. It was very interactive with lots of time for questions to be answered at every step. After completing the cooking we were shown the Temple offering rituals by their mother with Sunday giving us details on the meanings behind the offerings. Then it's time to eat your three course lunch which you helped prepare. It was delicious!! It was a 6 hour tour, class & lunch for under $40. The class was all couples but it would be just as fun with friends. It is just outside Ubud & if you're staying in Ubud they will pick you up for free. We had our driver take us from Kuta but would book a pick up through Lobong next time as it cost the same but you start & finish at different spots making it a little confusing for our driver."

Having confirmed our booking, we were later informed that a family group had requested an exclusive class and so the owners cancelled our booking. I contacted the owners to let them know how disappointed I was that they put the prospect of more bookings over customer loyalty and courtesy and was informed that the family had already made a prior booking, but when they didn't confirm immediately Lobong gave away their place to us. Subsequently to cancel on us when the family did later confirm. Warning to anyone who books this class that your confirmation may not be final, and if they request confirmation of your booking, respond immediately so they don't give away your place. Very disappointing process and the booking was cancelled the day before so very difficult to find an alternative class. I would go to one of the many slightly cheaper, but still fantastic classes such as Jambangan who put their customers before their takings."

Not only do you get an insight into how to cook some traditional Balinese cuisine, you also get an insight into the Balinese culture and way of life. The day starts with a visit to a local market, accompanied by Made Sunday who was an excellent guide. It was super interesting to see how the Balinese people buy their produce and how their markets work. We were the only non-Balinese people there which was awesome. They provide you with complimentary water and cold towels at the exact moment that you need - the whole day has all been incredibly well thought out. The class itself takes place in their family compound as opposed to a restaurant or cafe which is very personal and interesting. The class is taken by Made Sunday's brother-in-law. The food we made was delicious! The actual cooking time is around two hours. Our class only had seven people which was great, this meant we all got a chance to be hands-on with everything. The price includes pick up (around 8-9am) and drop off from/to your hotel (around 2-3pm). We were also able to observe offerings being made in the compound temple. This was without doubt one of my favourite days from my Bali trip! The tiniest thing that I thought could be changed was that it wasn't made clear that the additional drinks (e.g. Coke etc) that were offered while we sat down to eat were additional. However, the prices of these drinks was very reasonable so it wasn't a problem. Make sure you eat plenty before you go, you get a small snack on arrival at the comound but don't eat properly until around 12-1pm. Overall, it was a day well spent! Do this, you will not regret it!"

Our hosts took us through the market educating us on many of the local ingredients used for Balinese cooking. After the market we were driven to our host home where we received so much more than just a cooking class. We were treated as friends in their home and given coffee/tea and a tour of their compound while learning about their culture and family dynamic. We also witnessed an offering in their temple and they explained how and why this offering takes place everyday all over Bali. So impressed with their kindness and hospitality. Learning how to use and prepare different spices and ingredients together was really interesting.

From being picked up at our hotel, to travelling to a village market where we were taken around all over the market even behind the scenes. We then travelled to the family compound (5 mins) where we were greeted with coffee and banana fritters whilst being told how the compound is set up. Then onto the cooking where it was hands on. We it was explained what ingredients were what and how they are used to create such wonderful flavours. We were told how and why offering were done, then we had the opportunity to eat what we had all made that day. Classes are small (12) people and they also offer transport back. Don't miss this chance to experience not only just a cooking class. They also gave us a little gift of the recipies we made that day to re-create at home. A must do !"

My husband and I signed up to this course primarily to learn about Balinese food and do some cooking, but we did not realise it would be such an insightful crash course in Balinese culture too. A member of the Lobong family picked us up from our hotel and drove us straight to the local market to meet the others and our guide. We learnt loads about the food and it was totally tourist free - apart from us of course!Then to the beautiful and peaceful Lobong compound.

I bet you will remember how to do the dishes after 1 course) - Understanding Balinese culture (this is not just a cooking class. In fact the place is a home for Sunday and his family. Sunday is the guide who brings us around the market) - Fun and delicious balinese lunch (I enjoyed the session and had my own cooked Balinese lunch) This is NOT just a cooking class. It is a culture exchange with nice cuisine sharing. It is definately value for money activity. I have to say they have upkeep the home very well and beautifully decorated.Recommended for those who loves cooking or love food! Even for those who cannot cook, join them. It is easy and you might fall in love with cooking afterwards. "

It starts out with a pick up from your hotel in the Ubud area, then you go to a local market (not the touristy places you'd see on your own). The guide (who speaks very fluent English) walks you through the market showing you spices and foods you wouldn't see at home. He talks about things like how to tell if a banana is tree ripened, and what kinds of things we can substitute at home. They have everything carefully thought out down to the cold wet towels and water bottles after the market. You then go to a family compound to learn about home and family life, and how each compound is laid out and why. They make coffee or tea, and a special treat of fried bananas. Then you learn how to make an entire Balinese feast. Come hungry, because you get to eat the food you cook, and it is A LOT! Everything is so delicious, and they make every effort to keep the work stations clean and sanitized. Everyone we worked with was so helpful and lovely. We felt very welcome, even by the children in the compound. You can't beat this experience!! Highly recommended! Thank you Lobong Culinary Experience!"

Its taken me a while to write this as felt conflicted - in January we had the most wonderful experience at Lobong cooking school. The trip to the market, the family compound, the cooking instruction was all excellent and so friendly and genuine. Unfortunately the three of us who did the cooking course were incredibly sick afterwards with salmonella (suspect the chicken wasn't cooked or was handled in a way we are not used to which the Balinese chef did talk about). What was so scary was that I was in the early stages of pregnancy and feared we may lose the baby. The fourth member of our group didn't visit Lobong with us and was totally fine. Having 5 days of not being able to do anything on our 10 day holiday was not a great result!"

Sandae has a great sense of humour and is perfect man for the job. The classes are held in their beautiful traditional family home. I must explain that we have been to so many other places that look great on the net but turn out to be run down hovels But not this time we are glad to say. There was 9 in our class and Chef Dewa had us all working not only by showing us but by making us preparing and cooking the lunch we would be eating today, he also asked us questions to make us think so we weren't just letting him do all the work. I can say that warmth given from all the members of this family run business was most welcoming We really really recommend this cooking class to any other as it is truly amazing value compared to the others. Many thanks Sandae and Dewa"

He took us to the local market in Ubud first for a lesson on how the restaurants and locals purchase there fresh produce. We met up with the rest of the class there.. there was only 6 people in total - PERFECT number for us. Our host was Made and he was a very charming young man who spoken excellent English. He showed us around the market explaining the different fruit and veggies. He then took us to his home compound and it was beautiful. His Brother was the Chef and he was very hands on showing us the best techniques for achieving the best flavours. We also met his wonderful mother who showed us how we must make an offering to the gods for our food... this too was a great cultural experience. The menu was 7 courses and it was shown step by step how to do it. The end result was delicious. I do not like peanuts and one of the sauces was a peanut sauce, so he made a different sauce for me - very yummy! We had a wonderful bunch of travellers with us who complemented the whole experience. I would definitely recommend this to everyone who would like to try their hand at a cooking class in Bali. Thank you again Made (Sunday :) Kind regards,Karina and Julie"

Lobong Cooking Class is the best day out in all of Bali in my book, the day begins with a pickup from your accommodation to make the journey to a local market place in Ubud. Here you get to see where the ingredients we will cook with, come from. Then it is on to the family home for the cooking class in what is a fantastic outdoor kitchen, kitted out to accommodate 12 pupils through the tuition by qualified chef Dewa. All ingredients have been prepared before you arrive so it is straight into the cooking, including the slicing, dicing and grinding of the ingredients. Everyone pitches in to cook the meal which you will finally sit and enjoy with your fellow students. Todays table seated people from France, England, Chile and various parts of Australia. The food we ate, just like our last visit was amazing. Sang De the family host has a great personality, is very knowledgeable in many cultures and visibly enjoys sharing his culture with his guests, of which he is very informative and delivers in such a way he keeps you captivated so much so, you don't want him to stop talking. A wonderful day out, hope to return again soon."

After the informative stop they will take you over to their property.The class takes place in their compound or house. You will partake in the daily rituals and prayers to the elders and then go on to the actual class. They will teach you how to prepare each ingredient and the proper steps to prepare each dish. During our specific experience they also taught us how to make coconut oil. After all the cooking you will then be rewarded with the spoils of your work. Gathered together in a big communal table you will drink and dine.After every one is done it is time to pay up and you will be escorted back to your hotel."

From the moment we were picked up from our hotel to the time we were dropped back we were treated like very special guests.This is not just like any other cooking class. It encompasses the cultural side, local customs, spiritual importance of Balinese religion and everyday family life, truly inspirational and not to mention the way the teaching was carried out, in such a professional manner. I have learned so many new thing that I thought I already knew about cooking, like cooking rice the proper way! After walking through the food market and learning about the main ingredients in Balinese cooking we went back to the school, which is also a family compound set in beautiful surrounding. We make five or six different dishes, they all turned out to be delicious.I would highly recommend this experience to anyone wanted to learn about Balinese cooking and traditions. This course is very comprehensive and fantastic value for money.If I return to Bali I have no doubt I will go back for another course. Thank you Lobong. I had a unforgettable day.Kim"

Going back to the compound was amazing, the home of this family is so beautiful & finding out all about the structure & rituals of the family was very interesting.

We saw some offers for cooking classes on the streets, being held in Warungs and cafes, and we are so glad we decided to book online after reading reviews.Lobong Cooking Class does not disappoint. In fact, it's better than we expected.We were picked up from our hotel at 8am, but an talkative and friendly driver, taken to a local market to join the rest of the group. There were 7 other tourists that joined our group, and we met our guide, Sang De. Sang De, guided us through a local market, only used by locals to purchase food. We could tell that this was an authentic local market, because not once, were we approached by a seller trying to convince us to buy something. We were a bit of an attraction to the locals as the only foreigners in the market. Sang De was funny, informative as he directed us around the market, explaining the various customs, spices, and vegetables.After exploring the local market, we were taken to the Snag De's family compound, where we were shown around the compound, receiving a full explanation followed by banana fritters and ginger tea/balinese coffee.Soon afterwards, our teacher, Sang De's brother-in-law took us through the cooking class.The entire experience was amazing, starting at 8am and finishing at 2:30pm. It included seeing how to cook and actually chopping, grinding and cooking traditional dishes consisting of soup, curry, rice, and sweet green crepes.Everyone involved in the Lobong Cooking Class is polite, professional, speaks english and is entertaining and informative. There are plenty of opportunities to ask questions and they ensure that everyone gets involved.It concludes with being served the meals we prepared, including free beer or softdrink and being given a recipe book & home-made coconut oil to take home. The whole experience cost my wife and I approx 850K, and we also purchased a Volcanic Rock Pestle & Mortar for only 80K.I highly recommend this experience to anyone including kids, as it's a hands on authentic experience full of great flavour and food."

He then drove us to his family's compound where he explained about Baliense family life, how and why the compound is set up in the way that it is and other interesting facts about Hinduism in Bali --we were given coffee, tea and a welcome treat and then it was off to the kitchen.The cooking itself was tons of fun! Everyone got their own stations and was involved in prepping the ingredients, cooking the dishes, stirring and saut\u00e9ing (I've heard in other schools this is not the case). We all got to be a part of the class which made the day super fun and rewarding when we feasted on our delicious creations.

Sang De (our guide) explained a lot of the food to us and let us try a local fruit which was interesting. We then went back to their family 'compound' which is where all Balinese people live. It was really great to see inside their home to understand the Balinese culture. De Wa then guided us through making a full 3 course traditional Balinese meal. Everyone was involved in making every step, with all 8 of us making the meal together. We then got taken to their family shrine and Sang De explained all about the offering process while his mother did the offering for the meal we had created. Very, very interesting. The meal itself was absolutely amazing, and Sang De's information about Balinese tradition and De Wa's knowledge of traditional food was so amazing.

We had 10 people in our class which seemed like a good number. You didn't get a chance to prepare every step of each meal however lots of opportunity to observe. I think we would easily be able to replicate most of the dishes at home with the menus given. Chef Dewa has worked in 5 star Balinese resorts for many years as well as in Australia so has a good gage of how to translate this into Western home cooking. The food was delicious! The market tour was not too extreme- suitable for families. People with mobility impairments should be aware of stairs in the market and steep stairs to access the family compound. The information on Indonesian cultural background provided by Sang De was very interesting, I learnt many new things on my 4th trip to Indonesia. 5 stars to staff for friendly, welcoming and informative service."

An excellent way to have fun and learn more about Bali."

Right from being picked up in the morning we were right looked after, our driver that grabbed us from our villa was so friendly and informative about the area, our guide (Sunday) who took us through the local market was great, explained all of the ingredients and the Balinese culture In great detail and great English. The chef at the beautiful family compound explained each dish in great detail from technique to presentation. For a beginner cook like myself, it was easy to follow along, and the end result, our lunch meal was amazing and quite rewarding. Me and my girlfriend had an amazing time I highly recommend this class to anyone visiting ubud. Thanks to everyone involved!!"

He took us to a local market, where we were the only tourists. This made the experience feel very authentic. He showed us his family compound when we got back from the market, which is very beautiful and well kept. We did not realize this was such a major part of the package, but were pleasantly surprised! Sang De does well to transfer his love for his culture and customs to his clients. Our chef for the day was Dewa. He is a very passionate teacher and we had a lot of fun preparing the food. He was very thorough in his explanation yet very encouraging too!(I am a beginner cook hehe). And a bonus - we got a parting gift as well. A recipe book of the dishes we did included! All in all, a cooking class with a real Balinese experience to it! Can't recommend enough :)"

Despite the many classes the family had conducted, the guide Sang De and chef Dewa had consistently shown passion in doing what they loved. The culture of bali, the persistence in using organic ingredients and their incredible service mindset. Little details we looked into, cold towel after our traditional market tour. Will not write up on the details of the class as many had already given many detailed accounts.Definitely a must go if you are at bali.Thank you Sang de, Dewa and family for an unforgettable and enriching experience at lobong culinary experience."

This is a very slick, professional operation that still makes you feel part of the family. From pickup to dropoff, the market tour and the cooking class itself, you were immersed in the wonderful Balinese culture. The dishes were fairly simple but they concentrate on traditional family Balinese dishes. The key differential here is how they explain not only the cultural significance of the food, but also how traditional Balinese family compounds operate, which includes the giving of offerings to the family shrine of portions of the food cooked, before you partake. The whole family are involved and it is this involvement that makes this more than just a cooking class."

I've been to three other cooking classes in the Ubud area over the last 10 years and this is the best by far. The local market visit is amazing. You get to truly experience the life of a local Balinese who shops at the market from buying produce, poultry, pigs, spices, tobacco and even clothing and kitchen tools. Definitely out of the norm than going to the touristy Ubud market.The compound of Sange De's family is so inviting and beautiful. We felt at home and relaxed. They do a great job with the setup of cooking instruction as well as the traditions and understanding of the family compound.The food was so delicious, the best we've eaten on our trip. I love Balinese food and learn something new each time I take a class. Dewa is a trained chef and explains everything and answers any question you have. The staff is very accommodating as well. Offering water, coffee, jamu. A must do in Bali!!! So worth it."

They take you to their local market and guide you through the different stalls telling you about all the different vegetables and fruit. Then, when they take you back to their family compound, you are greeted with coffee and traditional morning tea.They love telling you about how their family and the way the compound works. Then you start cooking. You are guided every step of the way. You don't have to go above your comfort level.

After a refreshing cool drink we were than taken to the Lobong family compound which was extremely well set up and accommodated the cooking school.

And the Lobong cooking class was just excellent! - they are very efficient and accomodating to make the reservation via mails- you won't just learn about food: throughout the whole day they'll explain to you all about their culture and traditions. Bali is extremely rich culturally speaking, and it's fascinating to be in a familial house and receive explanations from Sang Made, who manages to make it accessible to all (great orator!).- but you still learn a lot about food!! The day begins with a visit to the market, where Sang Made explains all the basic ingredients, how to chose them, etc. Great!!The only two comments I have are: - the food we prepared was not very spicy - which is the way you eat it in the streets and markets of Ubud. I don't mean that everything should be very spicy, but everything was mild, even the dishes that are supposed to be spicy... When I asked why, I was told that as it's a class for foreigners, who usually don't like when it's spicy, they make it mild. To me it was a pitty: you come to learn how to make the food as it is made in Bali, and if it's too spicy, either you ask beforehand to make it less strong or you decide to spice it less once you do it back home. But they shouldn't decide for you.- when we were preparing the food, the person that was showing us the techniques was not always keen to answer our questions. Too bad, because we had tons of questions to be able to cook well back home, and everytime we had the feeling to annoy him.But in general, the day is perfectly planned. With a lot of little attentions that are very pleasant. I highly recommend the Lobong cooking class!"

Prompt pick up, fascinating trip to the local market learning, smelling and tasting so many different things. (Snake fruit was something I'd never knew about: how to peel or taste.) Our guide Sang De was well-spoken, gregarious, knowledgeable and engaged all with questions seeking how much the group knew about the culture, spices, fruits and all that we saw. Next up was to visit and experience their very lovely family compound with coffee/tea, fried bananas along with information about Balinese Hindu family homes that include a temple and fascinating architectural aspects. On to the cooking class where our chef, Dewa helped us learn and create the many courses of our meal. We chopped, ground peanuts, cooked and stirred. So many good memories of cooking, eating and enjoying the company of cooking classmates and our hosts; gift of recipes and coconut oil were a nice touch.

Our guide Sang De was great - very knowledgable about the history, food and culture. After the market Sang De invited us into his home where we got to experience cooking in a Balinese family compound. His brother was our chef (Dewa), and brought over 20 years of hotel chef experience. He was very funny and great teacher. All the food including the sauces we cooked were fresh, no MSG or pre-made ingredients and they also had options for vegetarians (I'm not a vegetarian, but there were a few in our group). We got to help prepare all the dishes we were going to eat, and the meal was delicious. We also received a parting gift (recipes from class + homemade coconut oil). Returned to our hotel around 3pm.

My one small gripe would be that there are quite a few people (12 in our case) on the class. Although this isn't a lot, it does mean that you essentially cook a meal between all of you and a lot goes on behind the scenes to get things ready. I have to say that I didn't really do an awful lot of cooking which was what we really paid for.

The visit to the market in the morning was enlightening and it was really nice to go somewhere outside of Ubud where locals come to shop rather than tourists. The cooking experience was really great fun and we learned all about the different technics used for steaming rice (80mins!!) and preparing the sambal olek and the peanut sauce etc... The menu is very extensive so make sure you don't have a big breakfast in the morning. It's worth it. Thanks a lot for this great authentic balinese experience."

We were lucky enough to get a place with only a days notice, and thank goodness we did! From the local market tour (a genuine local market!) to the introduction to the family compound - this cooking class taught us so much about the Balinese lifestyle and values - it was much more than just cooking! However, the cooking was the highlight - as someone who is a confident cook, I still learnt a lot of different things and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. But don't worry, less confident cooks were equally accommodated, and everyone was given a number of opportunities to be hands on throughout the lesson. Cannot wait to try out the chicken satay (sate) and peanut sauce at home! Thank you Sang de and family for welcoming us into your home and providing an experience we will never forget!"

Sang, our guide, was great and very informative. From here our group of around 12 were driven to the family compound (home) with cold water and towels in the cars. Here you are welcomed into the beautiful family home and given information about Balinese culture which is totally unique.For the cooking class you are handed over to other family members and you make a full meal completely from scratch. It is informative and fun and everyone gets really stuck in. And the results are absolutely delicious!! At the end of the experience you are given a recipe book so you can make the meals at home too.Overall the day is from around 8am to 3pm including hotel transfer. Honestly it was unforgettable, the family couldn't have done anything more to improve the day, make sure you book for a fantastic day in Bali."

I booked the Lobong Cooking Class via the internet prior to arriving in Bali, Sande's communication via e-mail was first class with very quick confirmation of the class.Sande's picked us up at our hotel in Ubud and took us to the market on the other side of Ubud picking up other people on the way. The market visit was very informative with Sande explaining all the local produce that we would be using to make our lunch.On arrival at his family home we were given an explanation of the typical Balinese home and their culture. Following this we were introduced to Sande's brother in-law who hosted the cooking class. The class was fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic lunch that we had all prepared, the highlight was the chicken satay, the peanut sauce is to die for!!!!!! Once we were finished lunch, we were all given a recipe booklet with alternative ingredient suggestions, coconut oil and the contact e-mail details should we wish to contact if we have any further queries when we try the cooking at home.If you are going I to try a Balinese Cooking Class whilst you are in Bali I would definitely recommend you give this one a try, trust me you won't be disappointed."

No tourists around and Sande explained how the market worked. We met many of the people selling their products and it was very informative. We then went to Sande's beautiful family home for the cooking class. Everything was explained in detail and every question answered. We were shown around the kompong and the layout and family structure was explained to us. After our cooking class, which was very enjoyable and hands on, we participated in an offering with Sande's mother, with the whole process explained to us. After that we enjoyed the beatiful food we helped prepare. The chicken satay was a standout - delicious! We were offered complimentary drinks and could also have a beer (charged) if that was wanted. We were all given a gift of coconut oil and a recipe book, and dropped off at our accommodation afterwards. All the ingredients were of high quality and very clean, including the bathroom facilities. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking and standing a bit. Highly recommended!"

The hygiene standards were high throughout - from the preparation of the food through to the toilets.

Then we were taken to the family compound where we were welcomed into their home, learned about family culture in ubud and then began the cooking class. We also learned more about the offerings in balinese culture and experienced it first hand in the temple in their compound.

We then started the cooking class and it was so informative and fun. They explained every step thoroughly and everyone got a chance to participate in the cooking. My favorite part was seeing how the satays wre grilled and how the rice was cooked.After the cooking was done and before we ate we got to experience giving gifts to the gods in the family compound. It was very neat to see. Then we got to enjoy an amazing meal where they served us. As apart of the cost, you get the cookbook from the recipes you made and a sample of hand made coconut oil. I highly recommend going here. The people are so friendly and it such a full cultural experience. They really care about sharing the Balinese culture and cooking with others!"

There are many cooking classes to choose from in Ubud, and here are the reasons that Lobong Cooking class ultimately won us over:- Small classes of 10 people max, which makes for a pleasant, intimate setting conducive to learning. - Menu seemed interesting (this was before we landed in Bali and became familiar with the local foods) and the family took allergies seriously. No shrimp paste was used during the class, and this was reassuring, especially with my shellfish allergy.- Free pick up in Ubud.Of course, I can name you even MORE reasons now after having taken the class why you should choose Lobong Cooking class over the rest. Besides the local market tour, the delicious ginger tea and banana fritters that have been offered to us before we got our hands ''dirty'' + parting present (coconut oil + recipe booklet), I'm thankful for our teacher who offered a clear, hands-on experience to those attending the class (enough for us to be able to recreate the menu at home -- thank goodness, as the Kare Ayam and Dadar Gulung were fantastic). We also appreciated the ingredient substitutions they provided and the patience they demonstrated to the culinary-challenged (i.e. ME) Best part of the class was stuffing your face with the scrumptious feast, of course!"

After reading the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor our group of two families booked the Lobong experience and we were not disappointed. We were picked up from our accommodation in Ubud, and enjoyed the trip out to Payangan village, about a half hours drive. It was good to go to a place where there are not so many tourists. The trip to the morning market was so interesting and we really appreciated being guided around by Seng De who had lots of personality and was a mine of information. Lots of good photo opportunities there too, and friendly interaction with stall holders. The lady selling piglets even held one squealing piglet up for us to take a photo! We were also fascinated by the coloured chicks, and painted crabs! Not to mention hearing about the suckling pig, how to kill eels and what fruits make good offerings!! After that we had the privilege of visiting our host family's home compound - a beautiful and interesting place where we had the chance to learn about \"real Balinese\" people. The cooking school is brilliantly run by the whole family who take different roles but have complimentary skills. After being served with a coffee or ginger tea, we were shown around and then started on the cooking. The array of foods and spices etc all laid out was wonderful and again, lots of photo opportunities.The facilities were professionally geared to a cooking class but yet authentically local. There was a good balance between being instructed and shown a demonstration on the one hand and having a chance to do the hands on work oneself. The main chef, Dewa, worked as a chef for many years and knows what he is doing but has a relaxed and friendly manner making it easy to ask him questions. We also appreciated meeting the elderly mother of the family who had prepared offerings for the family temple - we were then allowed to accompany her into the temple while these were made. This was also very interesting.After jointly preparing the food we ate lunch - one of the most delicious meals ever. Our own group included two teenagers and four adults - all of us had a great time. We are so pleased that we managed to get a booking for what is one of our best travel experiences ever. Very highly recommended and extremely well priced, especially considering that the meal is included as well as travel etc. You won't be disappointed if you manage to get a booking."

Have to mentionned his english is very good and all the information he gives is more than interesting. I've learn more in a couple hours about balinese culture and food than in our entire trip. The family compound is beautiful and the kitchen very clean. One of us has allergies to peanut and seafood and at Lobong it was taken very serioulsy. Apart from the peanut sauce, they don't use nut/peanut/shrimp paste in any of the dishes, so it was very safe. Chef Dewa was also very knowledgeable and a good host. Now the food,.. it was DELICIOUS and we had big portions, so you won't leave hungry. The food was just spicy enough and every ingredient was fresh. Honestly, it was one of our best meal in all our trip and we made it ourselves. What is also nice, is that you leave with a recipe book and also some homemade coconut oil. The price is very decent for the service and quality of food you get. I recommend Lobong to everyone, it is a must do in Bali. It's not just a cooking class but a great way to learn about balinese culture and food. Thanks to Sang De and his family for this amazing experience ! Merci beaucoup !"

Then, he took us to his home, a beautiful family compound just minutes from the market. Here he and his family welcomes us as family. They toured us around their traditional home explaining the intricate details so foreign to western culture. Then the cooking began! We met Chef Dewa, another member of the family. He carefully guided us through every step including traditionally steaming rice, making sambal, curry chicken, vegetable salad and chicken satay. All the ingredients were impeccable; so fresh, flavorful and fragrant. Finally we made creeps stuffed with coconut and sugar- wow!

He was also very open to questions asked about the place.Next, it was time to cook hands on. The chef who taught us explain how to do the dishes steps by steps. We were able to understand as well as follow his pace. He is also very encouraging, so first timer don't have to feel pressurize to do well or to catch up with the speed of others. Similarly, questions were also asked so that we will remember the technique acquired. In this class, we are able to have hands on activities such as frying, stirring, slicing, dicing the ingredients. All the cooking only took us 2 hours, to prepare 7 dishes. Lastly, we are served with the food that we cook and we are given a recipe book and a bottle of coconut oil as a gift to bring back. Overall it was a brilliant and amazing experience in Bali. It is not to be missed!"

It is SO much more than a cooking class--but rather a comprehensive lesson on Balinese culture. The class occurs at a family compound with a VERY professional cooking school built to suit about 10 people. The whole family is involved in setting things up, assisting, teaching & support. It is a beautiful home/compound with an equally beautiful family. My wife and I own a travel company and brought a group of 11 people to the class. It was a highlight for everyone. Can't wait to go back!"

I took two retreat groups from the USA to experience this cultural and cooking experience. It is one of the best ways to understand the cultural along with learning to cook their wonderful, fresh and flavor dishes. Sang Made treats each group as family and shares many details about the Balinese way of life and Chef Dewa makes you feel like a pro in the kitchen. At the end of your efforts you sit down for a fine meal and take home recipes so you can impress your friends and family when you return home. Each time I return to Bali, I will return to this class!"

When my sister advised us she had booked a cooking class on our holiday,I was \"yeh ok\" and after just contracting Ross River Virus 6 weeks before was wondering if I would stay upright for whole day.But it was just the remedy I needed.From meeting Sang Made & off for the tour of the local market, to look at the fresh produce we would use in our cooking that day, stopping to taste, smell & learn what some products were.Then back to his car for fresh hand towels to wash hands & continue to his family home \"Lobong\"As we descended into the Kampong the tranquility immediately enveloped us. Little birds chattering, beautiful gardens, water features, temple areas.While we sat & enjoyed a Balinese coffee & Pisang Goreng, Sang Made explained the home set up from the patriarchal family system to how every house designed with North/ East aspect.Then we were handed over to Chef Dewa & the team for a morning of cooking the best meal of the trip, cooked by ourselves & a lovely couple from Perth Sarah & TroyThe whole experience was a blessing, to be invited into their beautiful home & shown true Balinese culture & food.Meeting the Matriarch of the family with kindest smile, showing us the blessing of the food before we sat down to eat this beautiful meal we had all created.I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who is looking to learn more about Balinese culture & cooking. Than you Sang Made, Chef Dewa & family for welcoming us into your family home & enlightening us about your culture & cooking Wendy, Sue & Jo from Darwin, Cairns & Sunshine Coast (QLD)"

We are able to interact with the vendors and get a true Balinese market experience. Sang Made's English was excellent and it was a perfect introduction into an amazing day.After the market, we went to Sang Made's family compound where we were greeted with delicious coffee, tea and fried banana. Then we got right to work chopping and making the different sauces for the day. Chef Dewa did an amazing job explaining the different Balinese techniques and walking us through the different dishes we would be making that day. We made several dishes including chicken curry, sweet potatoe rice, chicken satay with peanut sauce, vegetable salad and a delicious coconut crepe for dessert. There was woman who was vegetarian and gluten free in our group and they were so accommodating to her restrictions. They had her make vegetarian curry instead of chicken and made a vegetable kebab for her. TBefore we ate, they had their mother made a sacrifice in their temple and then served us at a beautiful table in center of the compound. It was a true Balinese experience from start to finish and even gave us some coconut oil to take home!"

There were 8 students and we started by visiting the Payangian Market where we got to see different roots, herbs, varieties of rice, palm sugar, and much more. Afterwards we went to the family compound where Chef Dewa (20 years of experience) and 3 assistants taught us how to prepare seven dishes. This has to be one of the BEST cooking classes I have ever taken. It was definitely hands on and everything had been arranged and prepared just right to facilitate preparing all the dishes.This class is especially worthwhile because you get to visit the family compound (a very nice one), hear about the family history, and see how Sang Made\u2019s mother does the ceremonial offerings at the family temple before the meal was served. You are basically getting a lesson in Balinese culture and traditions as well as a cooking class. Tip: you will receive a gift at the end of the class, make sure you put the liquid one (won\u2019t tell you what it is) in a Ziploc bag to prevent any leakage in your suitcase."

There we met Sang De who gave us a really educational tour around the markets, showing us the ingredients that were going to go into our food for the day. We got to taste lots of things, lots of guessing what things were etc. so brush up if you want to be top of the class! Sang de has brilliant English and a great sense of humour. When we got back to the lovely family compound we were able to use their beautiful clean, modern facilities and then served tea or coffee and the yummiest banana fritters (which I really appreciated because I hadn't had breakfast.Dewa then took over seamlessly and began taking us through all the dishes we were making beginning with the spice paste. He explains and shows the techniques very well, it was a lot of fun and everyone gets plenty of turns.When we finished we watched Sang de's Mum give offerings in their temple and then sat down to our yummy lunch. I will definitely be trying to reproduce some of the dishes at home, the chicken curry was particularly delicious. And don't worry, the food is definitely not too spicy.The whole thing was wonderful, great job Lobong Cooking School."

Starting at the market, you are guided round, stopping at specific stalls to see, smell and feel some of the ingredients that you would later be using. The class itself is then held in a family compound where you are given an introduction to Balinese family life, their culture and a small snack of pisang goreng with coffee or herbal tea. The word 'compound' doesn't do it justice as it was a beautiful series of houses where each family unit of the wider family lives, with a family temple and ceremony spaces for everyone to share. This is the traditional way that Balinese people live and when a woman marries they move in to their husbands family compound.Then the cooking begins! For 2-3 hours you are taken through each of the 7 dishes step by step and for each one every person in the group gets the chance to cook. This part is led by a brilliant Balinese chef who has cooked in a top local restaurant for celebrities. He was very clear, his English excellent and he made it an easy and enjoyable experience. It was a fascinating experience to learn of all the stages involved in some key Balinese dishes and at the end you are given the recipes for them all so that you can replicate them at home. After all the cooking, everyone sits down to a feast of the dishes you have just prepared and this was easily one of the best meals we had in our two weeks in Bali. Our absolute favorite dish was the satay lilit and peanut sauce. So tasty that I am salivating just thinking about it!Every little detail was taken care of throughout the day from providing cold towels and water after the trip to the market, to the little gift given to everyone at the end. These touches were what made the day extra special for us and I can not recommend it highly enough!"

However, with Sang De's introduction, we still found the trip to the market very interesting.We spent slightly more than half a day and were very satisfied with the taste of the dishes that we prepared. Sang De and his family were all passionate to introduce to us not only the way of Balinese cooking but also their culture as well as architecture. After the class, everyone got a little souvenir - a very natural and beautifully scented coconut oil and a menu, even though we probably would not be able to prepare exactly the same dishes due to the challenge to find those fresh spices and ingredients back home.We had a very lovely time at the class!

The tour of the local market was an eye opener and very informative, in regard to local produce. This was followed by a tour of the family compound with Sang who gave a concise and clear explanation of the family structure and customs.Made then took us through the preparation of the meal, from basic ingredients. This was followed by the actual cooking part and then the meal - I can't believe how good it was.I recommend this experience to anyone looking to get an introduction to Balinese cuisine and culture."

Every aspect of the experience is choreographed, thought out, timed and executed. You are picked up at your hotel and brought to the market where a highly professional and knowledgable guide leads you through the different ingredients. The market is not touristy at all and really helps you to see how people in Bali truly live. Then it's onward to the family compound where over banana fritters and coffee the guide tells you all about Balinese life and religion -- a wonderful perspective that added so much to my knowledge of the place. It's one thing to hop around Ubud shopping and eating. This tour gave me so much insight into the religion and traditions of the Balinese which I glimpsed but never fully understood on my own. The cooking course is so much more than food -- the family are cultural ambassadors as well! I think this aspect is essential as tourists can gain deeper respect through understanding of where they are visiting. This is not to downplay the cooking and eating part of the tour! The kitchen is spotless and well-run and the chef guides you through each step with clear instructions and helpful tips to modify the recipes for home. There's more watching that cooking to be honest so serious chefs beware. I think the school is more geared towards the casual cook who wants a bit of cooking experience without too much challenge. Fair enough as this is probably describes the majority of people. Anyway, it's not as if the course is lightweight. The chef is serious about imparting techniques and information about the ingredients, it's just that the hands on time is minimal. While the food is being served up you get to witness offerings being given at the family temple and you're given further information about Balinese Hinduism -- fascinating. The meals are served up beautifully in a gorgeous pavilion. You'll enjoy a relaxing meal and a chance to chat with other travellers. Complimentary coconut oil and a recipe booklet finish off the day and you're whisked back to your hotel.This cooking course is a bit more expensive than others but it's worth every penny for its professionalism and the quality of the food and guiding. It will probably be the highlight of your trip, as it was of mine."

The cooking class caters for all levels and gives you the chance to learn some great cooking techniques. The highlight is sitting down as a group to eat the wonderful meal you have prepared. The cooking facility is exceptionally clean and well set up, bathroom facilities were also exceptional, and the family so friendly and welcoming. You leave with full tummies, a recipe book.

One of these very well organized young Balinese family businesses: Made collected the participants and gave us a tour around the morning market to show us where to get the ingredients for Balinese cooking. Then his brother-in-law Dewa awaited us with his assistants to teach us what to make from them.The cooking class is held at their own family compound which gave us an interesting insight into Balinese traditions. Before eating we even followed Made's mother to do the offering at the family temple. Nevertheless the cooking pavilion has nothing to do with a usual family kitchen but is newly designed for its purpose as a show kitchen. And Dewa is an experienced cook who has worked in restaurants both on Bali and abroad.After a delicious breakfast of coffee and fried bananas we worked together on the dishes, chopping and mixing the ingredients, taking turns at the stove. Only processes that would have taken to long were finished by Dewas assistants, like the barbecuing of the chicken sate. Dewa explained everything in a very nice and helpful manner and gave us also ideas how to substitute ingredients we could not get in our home country. They never take more than 12 participants so the group is small enough for everyone to follow his instructions.At the end we had a very delicious lunch together and were handed out the recipes in pretty cooking books. Thank you, Dewa and Made, for this great experience!"

After being picked up from our hotels, our friendly guide Sang De took us to a local market outside of Ubud and familiarized us with the different Balinese cooking ingredients. He did a wonderful job of answering our questions and drawing comparisons between the ingredients we find in our own countries. Upon reaching the family compound, we were made to feel right at home as Sang De explained the division of labor in Balinese families, the reasons behind different cultural practices and the layout of Balinese traditional homes. Our chef was very informative as well, and great about coaching us through the different steps of the cooking process. You were always encouraged to ask questions so that you could apply what you learned in your own kitchen. We had a group of 6 people and everyone of us was able to fully participate in the cooking process of all the different dishes. My only disappointment was in waiting until later in my trip to schedule this cooking class. Schedule this early on in your trip and you're likely to have a much more informed understanding of Balinese life and cuisine for the rest of your stay in Bali."

We were the only tourists at the market which also added to the experience.

From the market we were taken back to the family compound a short drive away. We felt warmly welcomed and enjoyed a delicious morning tea while Sang De explained more about the compound, his family and Balinese culture.We then met Chef Dewa, we were first shown through the many ingredients we would be using and the menu for the day then our team effort began. Lots of hands on, chopping, pounding, stirring, frying and preparing the rice in a steamer over the fire. Chef Dewa provided many tips, sharing his knowledge and experience answering our many questions along the way.Before our meal we joined Sang De\u2019s mother at the family temple for the daily offerings, a very special experience.We enjoyed our delicious meal in a beautiful setting and went home with a lovely gift and great memories.

Sang De expertly explained the various ingredients that we would be using later and mingled easily with the stall holders.After the market we were taken to the family compound where we were offered tea or coffee and served pisang goreng. We were then introduced to Sang De's brother-in-law, Dewa, who was a chef at an international resort. Dewa then went through the menu for the day and the ingredients that we would be using. His knowledge was fantastic, he explained each step patiently and was very clear with his instructions. We all contributed to each dish (cram cam gedang mekuah, kare ayam, sate lilit ayam, jukut urab, sambal ulek, nasi sela and dadar gulung) which we feasted upon at the completion of our preparation.Before we ate, however, Sang De's mother made offerings in the family's temple that included pieces of the food that we had prepared and we were able to witness this.The food was served to us a la carte style and every dish tasted amazing! When we were finished we were presented with a booklet that included the recipes for each dish and a small bottle of coconut oil and then Sang De transferred us back to the resort after a most wonderful half day experience."

We really enjoyed doing this Balinese cooking class!We were with two people and signed up an evening before (we had our hotel call). The following morning we were picked up at 8am at our hotel by the Lobong team and were dropped off at a market nearby Ubud where we were received by our host Sang De and where we met the rest of our cooking class.The course starts with a market tour. Sang De talks about herbs and spices with love and explains which ones we will be using during class > we would be preparing a Balinese meal.After the market, the food preparation takes place at the beautiful family compound of Sang De. Sang De explained about the traditional lifestyle of his family on the compound and about Balinese culture. Which was interesting to hear. The food preparation had a hands-on and interactive approach and was led by Sang De's brother, Chef Dewa. Chef Dewa shows you how to use and prepare fresh spices. No bottled sauces! You do everything yourself. The chopping, the mixing, the cooking. We prepared a full course meal - which we ate in the end. The instructions were clear and Chef Dewa shares many tips and tricks. You're invited to ask many questions.It was taken into account that I'm a vegetarian. I could fully participate. No problem whatsoever.Before tasting the result of our cooking, Chef Dewa and Sang De's mother performed a daily ritual of thanking the gods (before you have the first rice meal), which also included the family temple. It was special to be part of this.After our meal, we received a little book with the recipes, so we could continue our practice at home! In a nutshell:1. Clear English spoken. 2. More than just cooking/ Personal touch - Introduction Balinese family lifestyle and culture.3. Clear instructions / hands-on / interactive.4. Only use of fresh ingredients. 5. Suited for Vegetarians and Non-Vegetarians.6. Recipe book as a gift.7. Schedule: 8am -2pm. Pick up and drop off at hotel.Our conclusion:We definitely recommend the Lobong Cooking Class. You won't regret doing this. It was very eductional and we had lots of fun. Chef Dewa, Sang De and the entire cooking team are friendly and welcoming. Loved the family compound. Cooking in a beautiful surrounding!"

            "review": "Balinese Cooking & a Bit of Culture Too. What a great half day. It started at 8am with a pickup from our resort and a drive to the local street markets. Our 'guide' Sundai (?) walked us through these traditional markets, telling us about the unusual fruits and vegetables on display, and arranging the odd sample here and there. He also told us a little bit about the daily life of the people at the markets, both sellers and buyers. From there we drove a short distance to his home, which also doubles as the cooking school. The compound was beautiful. Here we were given welcome drinks (juice, Balinese coffee, tea) and told more about how a Balinese compound is structured in terms of building layout and who lives where. Fascinating stuff. We also started to meet some of the cooking school staff and find out what our program was. There were just the 4 of us today, so we felt like a very special little group.After coffee we headed over to the cooking area and met Chef and the team, including Sundai's mother, who was in charge of making coconut oil.Then it was over to the cutting boards, knives, wood fired ovens, pots and pans - our tools for the next couple of hours. We were to prepare about 5 different dishes, including a soup, several meat dishes, and a sweet, and then have it all served up to us for our lunch.We learnt the 'proper' way to cook rice, chopped and diced various vegetables, prepared a 'basic' paste for use in several dishes, fried our chicken pieces, hand mixed pastes, crushed up peanuts with a mortar and pestle, and generally had a great time, ably led by our enthusiastic chef and his team of assistants. After all the prep work was done we sat down at a lovely wooden table, had cold drinks, and were served our beautifully presented culinary masterpieces. I must say, they were all pretty darn tasty :-) We were then presented with a small pack containing the recipe book for what we had prepared, and a 100ml bottle of coconut oil that was produced on site. After saying thank you and goodbye to everyone involved, we were taken back to our resort feeling very full from our feast, and quite tired from concentrating when using the extremely sharp knives and very hot pans. No fingers were lost in the making of any of our dishes :-DThe Lobong team were professional, pleasant, prepared, and enthusiastic, and made us feel most welcome into their home. I would not hesitate in recommending them if you are at all interested in gaining some insight into the Balinese way of life and the delicious foods they eat."

We joined three others and thoroughly enjoyed the markets and the explanation of the foods that they use in their cooking. After the markets we were given some cold bottled water which was most welcome! We then travelled to the local home of a Balinese family and were given welcoming drinks and cold towels plus an explanation and tour on how the Balinese home works, it was informative and a great addition to what we thought was a cooking class. We then started the cooking class. It was fantastic, even some members of our group who don't often cook enjoyed it. After cooking we sat down with cold towels again and were served the food we had helped prepare. We could also purchase some cold Bintangs which was most welcome. The food was delicious and the best meal during our two weeks in Bali. We could not fault the day and was one of my most favourite days in Bali. Lobong Cooking Class add in some unexpected extras which was fantastic, they sent us home with our own coconut oil (which they showed us how to make) and recipe books detailing what we had cooked. Highly recommend!"

Not only do you learn about the food and how to cook it but you also learn a lot about Bali, its people and culture.We were picked up at 7:30 and then met with the rest of our group before we were taken to a market to learn about the food we were going to cook. This was a typical market and had no other tourists there apart from ourselves. We then returned and had a brief explanation of the day and the compound we were in. This gave us details about family structure, beliefs and was really interesting. The cooking itself was fun and we got involved and prepared and cooked a lot of the food either individually or as a group. The choice of dishes suited us as my wife doesn't like fish and isn't too great with spice. This didn't matter and what we prepared and ate was just great. You get a recipe booklet so you try at home and they are constantly telling you about alternative ingredients you can use if you can't get hold of the local ones they use.We had fun, learnt a lot and the food was great. It was a fantastic day and a great experience and we cannot recommend it enough."

We have done other cooking classes on previous Bali holidays that were really good I can say without reservation that the Lobong cooking class is by far the very best. You could not ask for a better experience. This is no cooking demonstration, it is a professionally run hands on cooking school where we prepared all of the ingredients, made the most delicious meal and shared it in magnificent surrounds. The cultural experience is wonderful and the hosts amazing but what really surprised was just how good the facilities were and how well we're were taught the skills and techniques to create great Balinese food. Whatever else you have planned to do in Ubud make time to do this cooking class, you will have one of the best Bali experiences possible. Do not miss this."

There were 8 of us participating in the class who only met up the morning of the class but we were made completely at home and relaxed. The class was so personal to each of us which was a great credit to everyone involved from the trip to the market in the morning to the cooking of the food.

They picked us up at 8 am and returned us to our hotel around 3 pm (though I wasn't watching the clock as the day was so amazing!) The trip to the local market learning about local produce and spices, hearing first hand about Balinese family, culture, traditions and worship while sampling Balinese coffee and banana fritters, watching the process for making coconut oil, cooking rice the Balinese way, and all of the knife prep, grinding, cooking and eating were just top notch. They provided vegetarian options, and were very kind and helpful with my 7 yr old daughter. The family were very polite answering every question. I really enjoyed seeing the inside of a traditional Balinese family compound. The cooking and bathroom facilities were modern and clean. There were ample prep and cooking stations to accommodate everyone in our class (we had 6 participants). The resulting food was the best we had in Bali. Bring extra money for a cold beer or soda to go with your meal, or to purchase your own Lobong apron to take home with you. We easily booked through their website the day before and paid about $35 for the entire experience including Ubud hotel pickup/dropoff, and half price for kids."

It offers an insight into both traditional and contemporary Balinese life. The day begins with a visit to the local market. It is followed by morning tea (ginger tea or coffee with small banana fritters) at the family compound, some hands-on prep of the local ingredients and then offerings are made at the family temple before a fantastic lunch in the garden. The courses include minced chicken satays (with the best peanut satay sauce ever), braised chicken leg in coconut sauce, mixed vegetable salad, and Balinese crepe - all with a cold Bintang if desired. Getting the basic spice paste (18 ingredients) right is the key to a successful dish. This was a return visit for our family. We first visited Lobong Cooking Class in 2011 - and our second visit in October 2013 was even better. Participants always leave with more than just a handful of great new signature dishes to try out at home. They also leave with a privileged insight into Balinese life and culture through the Lobong culinary experience courtesy of Sangde and his family. Highly recommended."

Lobong limits it to just 12 people. Also the other company would not allow my children (ages 9 and 11) to participate in the chopping/cooking, whereas Lobong let them participate fully, and only charged half price.The market tour was very interesting, we learned so much about Balinese cooking. In their family compound, we learned a lot about Balinese life. All in all, we were treated very respectfully, as honored guests. We felt welcome in their family compound, not just paying tourists that they had to tolerate. At the same time, they acknowledged that we were tourists, and allowed plenty of time for questions and pictures.Could I reproduce these dishes? Possibly, but not likely, even though we were given a booklet of recipes and a nice bottle of fresh coconut oil. But that's okay, we all enjoyed chopping and stirring and mixing, learning about the food, and of course, tasting it.After we were finished with our cooking, we were invited to their family temple to watch his mother make offerings. Meanwhile they plated up the food...it looked almost too delicious to eat.Highly recommend!"

I think 12 people is too much for a class to feel personable but I still enjoyed myself even though it wasn't really an activity for real foodies. The food was average. I would actually give Lebong 4 stars if I had not been so sick off the uncooked chicken (I projectile vomited for several hours after the class from bad chicken).

The day starts with a visit of an original local market outside of touristy ubud together with a perfectly English speaking guide. Here you are introduced to the ingredients of typical balinese dishes. After that you are invited into a family compound where you learn about balinese culture and traditions. The groups are rather small (9 participants in our case) and you get to ask everything you ever wanted about life in bali. The actual cooking class is very professional and the meals are delicious! All in all a 5 star experience!"

Everyone gets an opportunity to participate. It is a great lesson, wonderful food, and incredible experience! Would absolutely recommend. Beyond leaving stuffed, you are also given a book of recipes, and homemade coconut oil. To say that it is run by a family gives the wrong impression.. it is incredibly well organized, like a business, with a familial feel. You feel right at home, and are given an incredibly unique experience with lasting memories. Absolutely would recommend!"

A driver picked us up from our hotel and took us to the local market, we were shown through market and learnt of all the different ingredients and customs associated with the food we would cook and then eat later in the day, The market tour was fascinating, we loved learning new ingredients and trying various fruits berries and nuts. Once the tour was completed we were transported back to the family compound where we enjoyed coffee and banana fritters whilst learning the customs of the family and the compound. We were then led to an amazing outdoor kitchen, and introduced to our chef for the day Dewar. Dewar was extremely generous with his tie and nothing was to much trouble for him whilst he explained the ingredients, the best way to prepare them and how to cook them for best results, it is a very hands on experience and I have taken several new techniques away with me to use back at home. The afternoon was completed when we all sat down at a beautifully prepared table and treated to a three course meal that was second to none, the food was simply to die for. Lobong Cooking School was the highlight of our trip and we recommend this fantastic day to anyone that loves Bali culture, cooking and eating authentic Indonesian food, we cannot wait for our next visit to enjoy it all over again."

We were picked up by a driver from out hotel in Ubud, and taken to a local market. My boyfriend and I met with 6 others, and we spent just over an hour walking around a local market. That was an experience not to forget. I don't know when I would have had another opportunity to discover what it's really like for those, who live their days trading in the early morning markets. Its not clean, its open to the elements, the ground is muddy, there is rubbish everywhere, yet the produce is so fresh and very cheap (in Australian terms). It was a real eye opener. We were then taken back to a wonderful bali compound, and we were shown the basics of cooking, where the 8 of us, prepared all the food, put everything together, and ate our 10 dishes for lunch at the end. Our guides and main chef, were very knowledgeable and accommodating, and it was a very comfortable and fun experience. We were given the recipes, and a gift of coconut oil to take home! Absolutely worth it! I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning more about balinese culture and learning some cooking skills :)"

There was enough hands on experience to keep you occupied at a relaxed pace with a team of workers behind the scenes checking the rice on the wood fire, cleaning dishes and barbecuing the satays. Best satays of the trip too! Sang De is charming and quite professional with his customer service. Bathrooms are immaculate with overall hygiene of food preparation excellent.

Not sure if we read the small print but were expecting a half day and didn't finish until about 3.00, so apart from everything else it is great value for money.We also did the compound dinner offered by Lobong which included the insight into family and tradition as well as a really fantastic meal, so I can highly recommend that as well."

This is a great option in Ubud if youre looking for culture - you not only get to understand what goes into a Balinese meal and try cooking it for yourself - you also get to see a non-touristy marketplace where the ingredients are sourced. In fact, the trip to the market was the best part of they day, since the actual cooking can drag on a little (3+hours). It's a lot of time to spend on your feet in the midday sun, even in the shade. Also, the portion sizes are pretty small per person, and I recommend you don't go if you only like mild food, as there isn't a 'no chilli' option! Overall, a great market tour with a decent cooking class and mediocre meal at the end of it."

Superb!The tour of the *real* Bali markets was eye-opening and sensorily stimulating (and a little shocking, in some educational ways). The introduction to the family compound was very educational as well - you are welcomed into the family home, a true honour - the architexture is beautiful and Made's explanation of Balinese family tradition gives social and spiritual context to the 7-course meal you're about to prepare.The cooking class itself is a pleasure and a lot of fun - not to spoil any details but the dishes prepared are fun and have enough variety to suit all tastebuds and constituions -- they could even adapt for my gluten-intolerance, so no problems there.

Yum! The class size was small (maximum 12 people) and everyone spoke English well so we could get all our questions answered. This Asinan salad was both beautiful and delicious - I especially liked cooking with local fern tips. We not only learned how to make all these delicious dishes, but we learned about the Balinese culture, how the family compounds are built, the ritual offerings made daily, etc. - a great lesson in culture as well. And they have these nice small touches where you get water after your market tour and a cool refreshing towel, snacks throughout the class, etc. In our one week, we learned the most about the culture on this tour and had the most fun and one of the best meals.

Dewa our instructor/chef was clear in his cooking instructions and made sure that everyone in the group was fully included in all the activities. We cooked 10 dishes - exactly the menu on the website.After the cooking lunch was served up to us at a long table in an open-sided building and we all enjoyed the fruits of our labour.

Then on to the family compound where were greeted with refreshments and lots of information about Bali and customs. Well presented and fun. Cooking was hands on experience and with a group of only 11 cooking so not too crowded. It was in a very well set out kitchen, open on 3 sides so not too hot and a lovely view of the garden. Lobong chef is very good and a good instructor. With a price of about AUD40 for the 6 or 7 hour experience, I would say it was also excellent value. After the cooking is finished we then sit down and eat the results with a beer or soft drink if you want."

To eat the nicest food we have tried in Bali in such a beautiful family compound surrounded by great company, we can not speak highly enough of our experience here .The smoked duck was the best I have ever tried . We enjoyed it so much we returned with a group of 10 family members (also in Bali with us for a wedding) two days later and let me tell you it was nothing short of a delicious Balinese feast. They welcomed our family into the compound like we were there own, every one thoroughly enjoyed it and are still raving about it. The best dinner I have ever experienced in Bali .

Once we returned to the family home we got to see how to make coconut oil as the rest of the family set about preparing our ingredients before chopping/slicing/frying/cooking and steaming rice!Cooking for 2 hours included preparation, teaching and everyone got a turn and chance to ask questions.

My mind was filled with interesting facts and I hadn't even started cooking. The market used for the tour is off the beaten track allowing our hosts to really explain all the different foods. Onto the family compound where we learn more traditions and finally into the kitchen where we prepare 10 different dishes. Here there is no need to worry about remembering everything as the recipe covers that. Excellent experience."

For over 5 hours Sang De, our host and market guide, and Dewa, our chef and food guide, stepped me and four other 'cooks' (they take up to 10) across the threshold into their home and lives. Their brother-in-law Gunk De arrived to collect me at 7:45. He had a smile so wide it could have lighted up the universe. We collected another couple attending the course and then went straight on to their local market where we met up with the knowledgable and delightful Sang De and took a stroll thru the narrow alleys and piles of fresh food to learn about Balinese ingredients and culture. Then it was on to their beautiful family compound to rest and have a drink, eat some yummy banana fritters, learn more about Balinese culture and have a lesson in making coconut milk and coconut oil. Next, Dewa's cooking lessons were gentle and encouraging. When it came time to eat the 10 dishes we'd prepared they were presented beautifully, restaurant-style. The menu itself was superb and I loved that everything was fresh -including the coconut oil made that morning. Gunk De told me on the way back that everyone in the family has a background in tourism or hotel management and it shows. Cool towels to soothe one from the heat, snacks and drinks just when you need them, fine food, super clean everything (including western toilets) and the famous Balinese happiness and love that seems to seep into very aspect of this heavenly day. And on top of all that a gift bag to take home! A wonderful experience that I'd recommend."

If you are looking for a life experience that you will remember forever & possibly be the highlight of your holiday, then take this class.I used trip advisor to choose a cooking class to take while staying in Ubud. I chose Lobong because they seemed more personalised. I made the right choice! Lobong's classes never have more then 10 participants at a time. I was one of 5.After my day at Lobong I was on a natural high. It was a wonderful Balinese experience that will stay in my memory for ever.In the morning Sang Made guides you through his local fresh produce market. This alone was an amazing experience.You are then welcomed to the family compound to learn about how the family lives. This was a great insight into Balinese tradition.From here you head to the kitchen where you will prepare food for a few hours.Once all the cooking is done you will be served the most delicious Balinese cuisine you have eaten (your own creation). I would be happy to pay the cost of the class just for the food alone. Everything else is a bonus!I recommended two other travellers to take the class the next day. They too were beaming with enjoyment & raving about how great their day was.Book Lobong, You won't regret it!"

We were picked up at 8am and taken to a local food market, where we were shown a range of local foods and given explanations of their uses by the very knowledgable Sang De. On to the beautiful family compound where we were given either ginger tea or Balinese coffee. Sang De explained the buildings and the set out of their compound according to their traditional culture and beliefs. The gardens were beautiful and buildings so well maintained, it was a privilege to be there. On to the cooking part. After a demonstration of how to make coconut milk and coconut oil, we spent a few hours chopping and preparing our 10 dishes with the skillful and knowledgable Deiwa. The rest of the family ran around us clearing dishes, cleaning our slops and bringing out the next step. Deiwa was very kind to those of us who aren't experts with the chopping board, and encouraged all of us to have a go at every part of the process. Just before we sat down to enjoy the efforts, we followed Sang De's Mum in placing offerings in the family temple to give thanks for the food. The food was amazing, we learnt an enormous amount and were given a little \"package\" to take home. Won't tell you what's in it because it is a great surprise at the end. The whole experienced far exceeded any expectations, is excellent value for money, and highly recommended."

Its not just an insight to the amazing food its also an insight in the Balinese culture and family structure. A visit to the markets for the locals in the morning is certainly an education and very different to the Parap Markets in Darwin which is why it just added to the overall experience of the day. You are picked up in the morning, taken to the markets then back to the family compound to have step by step cooking lessons where you get to cook it all as small groups. You then sit down as a group and are served the lunch you have prepared. It costs about $40 per person but for the time and the experience it is certainly worth it."

I wanted to write a really great review and encourage everyone to take this cooking class... but I think every other review on Trip Advisor is already doing this!!! I have been trying to cook Indonesian food for many months (since I fell in love with the country and the food on my past four visits!), but did not have much success in the process. My partner and I booked a trip to Bali and this time I wanted to attend a cooking class to find out what I was doing wrong. I spent months (literally), looking for a cooking class. I had very specific items I wanted to cook, how I wanted them to be cooked, how many people were to be in the class, the utensils used and the location of the class. In the end, it came down to Lobong and one other class. Right from the start of my research, I had a feeling that Lobong was the right class for me. Although other classes were teaching recipes that I also wanted to learn how to cook, I didn't have a connection with them (sounds crazy, I know). I sent Sang Made an email and he replied straight away, he answered all of my questions and was very polite. I decided to go with my gut feeling and booked Lobong! It was the best decision I've ever made. Right from the very start, the class was fantastic. We went on the traditional market tour, then learnt about the Balinese way of life (very interesting!), and then we started to cook!!! The chef, Dewa, was a great teacher and very funny too! Finally, we were served our food in such a lovely way. It was the best day I've had in Bali. Thank you Sang Made and the family for such a great experience. I will be sure to recommend your class to all!!!!"

Sang-de and his whole family had a role to play in the day and they worked hard and professionally behind the scenes - nice touches were the cold towels after the market tour and the icy cold water during cooking, which is a hot process in Bali!

The cooking class itself was great, with the meal served to you a la cart at the end (rather than buffet style I have experienced in other cooking schools). My only criticism was when we mentioned we had been to other Bali cooking classes in the past, some staff members went out of their way to \"slag\" them off. ie. They have too many students or They don't give you a hands on experience like we do. But I guess I'm just not a fan of businesses putting down others for their own gain.

Once the meal had been cooked, we accompanied San De's mother to the family temple to watch her make an offering before we sat down to eat. Once at the table, the food we had cooked was absolutely delicious. Our 16 and 14 year olds were very open to eating all the dishes in front of them because they had invested time and effort into creating them. (Note to self!). My daughter is vegan and they catered to her needs with specific dishes she prepared as an alternative the meat dishes. I was really impressed.

They picked us up from our home and took us directly to the meeting place where we went together to the market. The market was very educational - a tour of the structure, the different vegetables, spices, meats, and other ingredients. My daughter was even captivated by it all! Sang 'de was super, and his English is as good as any you'll hear in Indonesia. The home compound where we come back to do the preparations and cooking is gorgeous. Extremely neat and clean and super organized for a group. The groups are not huge - max of about 10 or 12 I think. So you get good instruction and service. The staff are super, and Dewa, the main cook is awesome. His English is also excellent. His skill as a chef is obvious he is very patient and friendly! And he makes sure you learn technique and don't have to memorize recipes - they give you a recipe book and bottle of genuine coconut oil to take home. You then get to eat, and it is incredible! The ingredients are obviously fresh, and you have ground the spices right there! They even let my daughter participate and take pictures. Of course, the Balinese love children, so she was right at home. I can't say enough about all the staff and the experience. And to top it off, the price is very reasonable for over a half-day genuine Balinese experience. in talking with others in the same class, they had checked around more than I and found this was either the most reasonable or close to. And based on the fullness of the experience, I know for a fact that you wouldn't get a better value for this kind of experience. Thanks again Dewa, Sang Ade, and staff!"

We were then guided around the market meeting local vendors, with great explanation by our guide and a warm welcome by the people there. Saw sights and smelt smells only found in boring dried up form normal in jars at the supermarket (if you can even find them!). After the markets, where we tasted and smelled all we would work with later, we travelled to the main house but not before we were welcomed at the cars with a cold flannel and water... they think of everything.The experience there was warm and welcoming. Smiles everywhere within the venue's complex (it is their home at the end of the day) before we met the lady of the house. Here we saw the fresh coconut oil process and then to the open air kitchen area.The head chief was brilliant, great English and SO knowledgeable. Not your average \"head chef\" with smiles and laughter followed by a great explanation of the process ahead. All hands on, every dish, which was easy to follow and very tasty. After several hours of absorbing as much knowledge as we could we finally got to eat out wares. Delicious, fresh and honest food.

We ended with being handed cold towels and bottled water to help cool off for the ride back to the family compound.Upon arriving at the compound we were given a tour and taught about family life and how the compound is set up and then enjoyed Bali coffee or tea prior to starting the cooking class. During the cooking portion, the other participants and I made a nine course traditional Balinese meal. We did all the work and it was very hands on. It was incredibly thorough and very informative. At the conclusion, we were shown the Balinese offering that is done before meals and were able to go to the family temple and watch the offering. Such a wonderful experience to understand the offering and witness. Following the offering, we all were seated at a table in the gardens and served our meal, which was delicious. Prior to even coming to Bali, the email communication was prompt and it was very easy to book and even during the class and afterwards the service and professionalism was superb.The food was amazing, the education style was hands-on and came complete with our recipe book to take home. It was so well taught that I am confident that I could recreate some of the dishes! Overall what made this experience memorable was the immersion into the Balinese culture by the host family. A wonderful experience and highly recommended to anyone interested in understanding more about Balinese cooking or culture!"

The day started with a fascinating tour through a local produce market (we were the only tourists in the market!) before moving on to the Sang family compound where we learnt to cook 10 different Balinese dishes. The Sang family are incredibly friendly, knowledgable and welcoming and we learnt as much about Balinese culture as we did about the Balinese cuisine. We'd recommend this activity for anyone interested in learning more about Balinese cooking or culture. A great day!"

We attended the Balinese Compound Dinner last night as we had previously been to the cooking class on our last visit to Bali.From getting picked up in Kuta by a very polite young driver to getting dropped back at our hotel later that night the experience was excellent!We chose the Suckling Pig and slow cooked duck as our main course and were blown away.The duck especially was the best we have \"ever\" eaten!!We were greeted by Made on arrival and chatted with drinks about his village and Balinese culture for about 30 minutes before our meal was ready to eat.During the meal the young waiter looked after us very well and also chatted to us about his village and Bali in general.After a excellent dinner we sat around with the whole family including the chef and talked for ages about our different and in many ways the same lifestyles.The family were genuinely interested in us and our family as we were in them and there's.We left having made new friends with an invite to \" call in anytime\" we are in the area.Do yourself a favor and make a visit to Lobong a must do!!Carl and Barb - Adelaide, Australia"

The class takes you on a very thorough tour of a market after picking you up from your hotel in a airconditioned car. The guide talked us through many of the traditions and highlights of market foods and traditions. Able to answer every question about culture and food. The food we made ourselves was delicious and we learnt alot about technique and spices/herbs. There was also insight into the caste and home life of a traditional bali family. There were offerings made and explained to us. The goup we had was very nice as well (mostly aussies).Thank you Lobong :)"

It makes all the difference. The people at Lobong will pick you up from your hotel anywhere with a friendly driver and bring you to the experience. We started at a local market (no tourists,) which was a great place to learn about the foods used in traditional Balinese cooking. We did the cooking class at the family compound, a beautiful and tranquil and spotlessly clean place. There were loads of people helping, which was good for us as we had 2 children with us who needed some help. I feel like we learned more about Balinese food and culture in this one day than in our whole previous week and a half on the island. The resulting meal happened to be the best we've had, also. Terrific staff, service and result all the way around!"

We were taken to a local market where our guide Sang De (who had the best English skills) explained to us the different types of ingredients and food that we would be using at our class. Certainly a unique insight into everyday life as there were no foreigners besides us at the markets. We were taken back to the compound where we met De Wa, our teacher who was very informative and knew a lot about both Indonesian and western cuisine. He answered all our questions, explained why certain cooking techniques had to be used and the whole experience was very hands on. I couldn't believe that we were actually eating the food we had prepared earlier. It's probably the most traditional and authentic meal I've had on this trip. One of the best things we've done on this trip. Something you have to try if you're in Ubud. Thank you Lobong!"

Important detail: we booked out the entire class as a couples class so it may be different to a normal group class.Prior to this class, I had never cooked Balinese cuisine. They helped me every step of the way, without doing too much for me. My partner is more confident (faster) with prep and cooking so at some points I was assisted to keep up with her pace.As we all know, doing it yourself is the best way to retain new information. They were friendly, relaxed, helpful and informative. The food tasted great. It was a really memorable event on the holiday and I highly recommend them to anyone who loves new experiences.Tip: Back home, I wasn't able to acquire some ingredients - in my case, kaffir lime leaf wasn't available from local grocery stores. If you intend to cook these dishes at home; plan ahead, read the ingredients list well in advance of serving time."

Then we were taken back to Sang De's family's Balinese compound which is where they have the cooking school. Not only were we informed about the cooking but we also got a real lesson on the Balinese way of life and about family and customs. The cooking was taught by DeWa (Sang De's brother in law) with help from his little chefs and we had a blast. The end part was of course tasting what we had cooked. What a treat!

We were picked up from our villa by a lovely driver who proceeded to tell us how the day would run. Everyone working at the cooking school are part of one extended family and as we talked to different members over the day we built up a picture of how this family work together to create the best business they can. Almost all of the men had worked in hospitality and this shows in their good English skills and attention to detail..You start the day by visiting the local market where our first host Made explained about markets and showed us all the vegetables and herbs we would be using. We didn't buy anything from the markets as they source all their food from their garden or butchers to ensure that the ingredients are safe to eat (very impressed by the hygiene standards throughout the day). Then it was back to the family compound where we were told all about how it was arranged and how family life worked. I knew the basics about the temple facing Mt Agung but we learnt lots of sweet little things about family life that were so unique and meaningful, like how you sort out disputes when all the brothers share a compound! Can't imagine a bunch of Western men sharing a house with their father all their life! After a drink of ginger tea or coffee and yummy snack it was into the cooking. We put our aprons on and went off to wash our hands. (The toilets too were brand new and sparkling). Our chef had worked and trained at one of the top hotels in Bali and his passion was evident. He worked us hard for our lunch ;). We chopped and smelled and stirred and tasted our way through prep. Every time we finished with a spoon or bowl someone would be there to whisk it away to be washed. The organization and forethought was staggering! There were nine of us in the class, two being children who did a bit of chopping before getting bored and wandering off to enjoy the beautiful fish ponds and garden. After cooking the meal it was time to clean up and don a sarong to make offerings at the family temple. Once again I learned more about the intricacies of how the offerings work I never knew. Lunch was served restaurant style with each course brought out to us with the 5 star presentation the chef had brought with him from his previous life. Master chef would have been impressed!I cannot rate this whole cooking experience high enough. There were no negatives and too many positives to mention. It was more than a superb cooking experience it was a window into a beautiful Balinese family!"

They take you to the market in the morning, where you can see where the locals come for their ingredients. Seng De gives an explanation of each ingredient before taking you to his house to learn to cook from his brother. The tour includes step by step instructions for the food prep and even an explanation of balinese customs for food offerings to the Gods. Getting to go inside the family temple and watch their mother perform the offerings was very special. I also really thought the food tasted azmazing, but then again, I did help cook it! I highly recommend this to anyone visiting the area!"

From the very start of the day: at pick up time from our accommodation; to the local market; learning about the family compound; their way of life; the garden where herbs and ingredients are grown; and the giving of an offering before lunch was extraordinary. My husband, who does not cook, commented at the end of the course that he was surprised by the flavours that he could create when shown how to put different foods together. This response is a reflection of Wyan\u2019s patience and guidance that he demonstrates throughout the class. We also found the class was well organised and as we were the only two participants this gave us a greater hands on experience. The menu for the day consisted of a large range of dishes which, with the take home book of recipes and coconut oil, we will replicate at home. We would like to sincerely thank Sang De and Wyan and all the other people helping on the day for providing us a very enjoyable experience; one that we would be happy to repeat and to recommend to others."

This time, together with friends, we did the afternoon tour. This is different from the morning in that instead of a visit to the market , Sang Made takes you on a short trek into the Ayung valley. This requires walking to /from the valley floor via steep steps but the effort is well worth it. The views are spectacular and the walk through the paddy fields interesting particularly enhanced by the insights provided. After the walk there is a chance to cool down whilst being provided with a full explanation of the compound and its workings. Then the cooking which is great fun even for non chefs (which were a majority in our group!). The menu is fantastic and the end result one of the best meals we had in Bali with the added satisfaction of our contribution to it. The whole experience is fantastic and Sang Made and his team (including his mother who makes the compound offerings) ensure it is an unforgettable few hours that gives you a great insight into Balinese life. We will definitely be returning!"

This cooking class is how you will best experience the real Bali!You will start your day with a tour of a local market to look at all the spices and veggies that you will use in your cooking. You can even use that market trip to buy some fruits for yourself! Sang De is the person who tours you around and explains things to you. After the market, you will relax over a morning tea and snacks at the owner's home. That's where you realize that the Lobong Cooking Class is a family affair every every part of your experience is handled by the same family! You will get the most hands on experience with this class with a small teacher to student ratio. The day we took the class, it was 4 students to 1 teacher. Our class was taught by Dewa, who was very good at going at a good speed and making sure everyone got a chance to practice making the dishes. He focuses on the technique to make the food authentic balinese. He says that you can measure and read recipe book later so focus on the technique first. He taught us how to make 9 items and customized 2 items for me since i didn't eat red meat. He helped me make 2 fish dishes and sent me the recipes for it a few days later. On a side note, I brought my 6 months old baby on this excursion and thought that my husband and I would trade off during the class. Their family members ended up babysitting him the entire time so that we could enjoy ourselves. THey even offered to make him baby food too! We brought our own so they fed him what we had on us."

            "review": "Most fantastic experience. I signed my husband and I up for the cooking class at Lobong after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. One of the best decisions of my life! Lobong was chosen because of the hands on cooking that was mentioned by other reviewers. Before confirmation with Lobong, I made sure to double check that the class size would be small and there would be significant hands on practice. I was assured that class size would be kept to a maximum of 12 participants and lots of hands on cooking.On the day of our class, the driver picked us up punctually but we were about 10 mins late. So my apologies to other participants of the class. There was eight participants that day, including my husband and I. After we were picked up, we proceeded to the next pick up and with 4 participants in the car, we headed to Panyangan market, a market where only locals visit. We met up with the remaining participants and the market tour was headed by Sang de, who was fluent in English. In the market tour, we learnt quite a bit about the roots (eg ginger and turmeric) used in Balinese cooking and the local vegetables. The market tour was informative and I liked it a lot.Thereafter, we were brought to the site of the cooking class, which is the house of Sang de. The little details were very much appreciated. Eg, we were given cold towels and drinks after the market tour. When we reached the compound of Sang de's house, that's when the real interesting part kicks in. While seated with ginger tea, we were briefed on the Balinese culture, in terms of their accommodation and daily lifestyle. It was amazing to hear Sang de talk about the different parts of the compound and their uses and functions. The Balinese way of life is so very distinctive from most cultures and very very family-centric. Sang de mentioned about Balinese trying to strike a balance in everything they do, including their cooking. Then we were introduced to how coconut oil is made. Not a difficult process, but a lengthy one. Fresh coconut oil smells heavenly and I'm sure it made all the difference in the cooking.We were then handed over to the chef, Dewa, who taught us the correct way to hold a knife. I also learnt the right way of chopping (thought I already knew but turned out my technique was wrong). So we shared the chopping amongst the eight of us and that took about 25 mins or so to complete. We also cooked rice the Balinese way, which took 1 hour and 15 mins to do so. The rice that we ate was very fluffy.Our menu for lunch included chicken sate with peanut sauce, tuna salad, green papaya soup. All the food tasted fabulous and my favourite has to be the peanut sauce! Maybe it was because I was the one who fried the peanuts and my husband who cooked it, I thought the peanut sauce was one of the best I ever had, and I have had quite a bit of peanut sauce in my life. The peanut sauce was addictive!!! We are going to make that this weekend!The tuna salad was super yummy too. The tuna was very fresh and thick and I didn't know tuna could taste like that. Throughout the cooking, Dewa was keen to ensure that we remember the techniques more than the recipes since we were provided with the recipes at the end of the class. He said remembering the techniques is most important. Wise words indeed!The lunch we had was one of the best meal we had in Bali! It was so good I wanted to come back for another class. Sang de said their menu changes every 6 months but because the Balinese food does not have a wide variety, there is no extensive changes to the menu. And at the end of the session, we were given 100ml coconut oil and the recipe book. Both my husband and I enjoyed this class tremendously. It was the highlight of our trip! Not only did we pick up some cooking tips, we also gained an insight into the Balinese culture. I strongly recommend this cooking class. Not to be missed!"

It was noisy, busy, and full of colour and smells. A very interesting and unforgettable way to start, with a wonderful guide who explains the produce and where it is from. Then you go to his home 'compound' where you walk to the back part of it to a very clean commercial style but basic kitchen, there is a room off it with a great wood stove where rice is traditionally prepared and cooked. The teacher has had twenty years as a chef at a five star resort in bali and really knows how to teach. There was only 7 in total in the class which was a perfect size for learning, and one of the best things was the commitment and passion of the teacher. The setting is idyllic, and it was a pleasure to spend a few hours chopping up ingredients and learning how to prepare ultra fresh meals. Then you sit down and eat it. We had nine dishes and they were all delicious. You receive a small book of the recipes and some coconut oil to take home. I have already made one of the dishes back at home and really fell like I got a lot out of just one class."

The family compound was a pleasure to visit with the family welcoming us all. Learning about their way of life and giving an offering before lunch was a great experience.

Then he welcomed us into his home compound - a beautiful place - and explained how the family compound is laid out and how things work there. What a fantastic experience to be welcomed into a home, and get a glimpse of real Bali life! Then the cooking started. Everyone watched everything being made, with someone doing each step under the expert guidance of the accomplished chef. There were 6 in our class, so it was a great size for questions and sharing. Everything (including the rest room) was perfectly spotless and everything was done with excellent hygine standards. The offering ceremony was special to witness and another precious glimpse into the real Bali. Then the food we had prepared was served.

So colourful and I learned so much about culture from this trip.After is we were taken to Sang Made's family compound- which was beautiful and were shown around and treated to Pisano goring (banana fritters) and ginger tea while Sang Made explained how the Balinese live and the function of each section of the compound.We were then introduced to Sang Made's mother who showed us how she made the coconut oil, which smelled amazing- then the cooking began.Dewa and his team took us through all of the ingredients and the stages and gave us tips on how to improve technique- Dewa was right when he said the key to Balinese cooking is in the preparation, we have just made our first base Gede at home and it took an hour of prep but then the actual cooking is easy! His guidance was so valuable and my husband and I were lucky that we were the only members of the party that day so we could get his expert opinion on every aspect. There were a lot of dishes to prepare and we learned so much as we cooked... I am an avid cook at home so was really excited to get Dewa's expertise as I learned these new dishes.After we had finished the prep we were invited to make an offering the family compound's temple. This was really interesting as we had seen the offerings but had never had the meaning explained to us, it felt very apt that we could take part in this in a Balinese family home.Lastly we got to eat. The food was delicious and Dewa had presented our cooking beautifully. The recipes were delicious and I honestly think that the food was among the best we had in Bali and that is down to Dewa and Sang Made.I honestly could not recommend this enough, it was lovely to come into a family, learn how they live and cook food- they were so welcoming and warm. It was a real honour to be involved in the class. Sang Made's English is exceptionally good and we were always made to feel that no question was too trivial. If you could do one thing in Bali, do this. It was amazing."

We were collected from our resort and brought on tour of the markets and the rice fields then back to the couples home where we were met with a lovely welcome drink. The couple are very funny which make the day so enjoyable! Best part is you get to eat all the yummy food at the end.Definitely a must-thing-to-do when in Ubud! :-)"

Starting with a visit to the local market to learn all about the different foods and their uses, we then went to the family home to learn the art of Balinese cooking. Preparing 9 dishes in all, watching coconut oil being made, participating in a temple offering, and then getting to enjoy the fruits of our labours for lunch, completed the experience. The little gift at the end of the day was just the icing on the cake! Fantastic experience - I loved every minute."

The market itself was not interesting at first glance, but our host was able to show many aspects of local life as he strolled us through the market.The class is hosted in the family compound which really enriched the experience. As we were explained the various parts of the beautiful compound, we gained perspective on the Balinese philosophy of life.

My sister and 14 year old son joined me and we had an amazing time on our Balinese culinary journey. Our host Sang Made escorted us through a traditional Balinese market that was a kaleidoscope of colour with an array of exotic herbs, spices, fruits and vegetables. The outside market was a buzz of activity with merchants selling live ducks, chickens, pigs and clothing etc. On arrival at the family home (known as a family compound) we were greeted by our Master Chef, Dewa and commenced our class with great anticipation. The whole experience was fantastic and exceeded our expectations. It was a joint effort as we all shared in much of the time consuming preparation of chopping and grinding before the cooking began. What a gastronomique delight it was to prepare some truly tantalising authentic Balinese dishes. The chicken sate with sate sauce made lovingly and patiently from scratch was outstanding as was the tuna and fern tipped salad with chilli dressing and the broiled chicken in spicy coconut sauce. After a traditional blessing in the family temple we were seated to a sumptuous table filled with all the dishes we had prepared during the class. Our taste buds were alive and dancing to the contrasting flavours that were captured in each dish. During our stay we also learnt a great deal about the Balinese culture and way of life which helped to gain a better insight into the beautiful, kind and gentle people who live on this magical island. On our departure we were given a recipe book and a 100ml bottle of coconut cooking oil made by Sang Made's mum. We plan to use it when we treat our family to a Balinese buffet using our new found skills. Thank You Lobong Cooking School for a holiday highlight. No true \"foodie\" should miss this."

HOWEVER, the recipe book we are all given to \"cook at home\" is extremely disappointing. The Base Gede doubles the amount of ginger required resulting in a bitter tasting paste, the Base Sate is obviously missing an ingredient (we added Kepas Manis), the Sate is listed as chicken in the index but pork in the recipe (a minor matter), the Fern Tips Salad omits to advise to cook the red beans and the Fish dish cooking method is impossible to understand.......there are a lot of mistakes both in ingredients and cooking method. After several disasters, we checked all the recipes on the internet and made many changes. So, a lovely day at the compound but a very disappointing recipe book. Sorry, but we were so excited to be cooking these dishes again and presenting them to our friends.....the result was a waste of time and money."

We were then brought to the family compound where the cooking class was held - very clean, tidy and great for photos. Provided a refreshing hot drink with snacks, and then made 9 dishes in total - loved the tuna salad and the sambal. The day was very hands on, the chefs were very helpful, and the food was restaurant-quality. The main message I got - Balinese food is all about patience and care. We also had a great group of people (10 of us) partaking who were full of questions and stories, so if you love food and cooking, you should definitely try this.

I hv been in Bali many times but this event is something exceptionally.I am not much into cooking but the class was done in such a way that time flow by and at the end we had cooked together a wonderful and super tasting meal. However , before we could eat it, we had to follow the Balinese tradition and gave respect to the gods in the local house tempel. This brings me to the extraordnary part of this trip. Not did we learn all about the typical Bali food , fruits , spices , etc. but also a lot about the Balinese culture and customs. This is possible because the whole team belongs to one family and your class takes place at their compound which by the way is in top conditions. One last comment , the sanitary installations are excellent . I like to wish Sang Made and his family all the very best for the future and I am convinced that this will not be the last idea they have.

Our host, Sang Made, showed, explained, let us sniff and touch the produce we were going to be using to cook our lunch. It was a very good introduction to the differences (and in some cases, similiarities) in our foods.After the market we were driven to Sang Made's family compound (a beautiful, serene space), welcomed by others in the family including Sang Made's mother and presented with ginger tea and fried banana snack. While imbibing, Sang Made explained some of his country's traditions and customs.From there, we moved to the kitchen area and proceeded to watch and take our turns at creating a delicious lunch menu under the guidance of Dewi. I loved the way Dewi helped us understand the processes and checked that we were following his instructions. Lots of fun - and wonderful aromas as the food changed from ingredients to delicious courses.We watched the offering made in the home shrine before sitting down to a convivial and enjoyable lunch with two other holidaying couples who were also in the class.

I had booked a morning class a month before arriving in Ubud and was pleasantly surprised to learn that only my friend and I were signed up for that day. The driver suggested that we try the Trekking-Cooking course which is usually set in the afternoon but being only two in the class, he said it was possible to do it in the morning. I was a little concerned about the mid-day heat but went ahead with the trekking course anyway for a minimal additional fee.Actually, I'm glad to have done the trekking trip in the morning when the air was much cooler and with the clouds intermittently blocking the sun, it made for a rather special morning trek in the area where part of the Eat Pray Love movie was set. Our guide was quite knowledgeable of the local flora and fauna and we even happily found common words between Balinese-Bahasa and Filipino. It must be our shared Austronesian ancestry. My friend did not bring sneakers on this trip and thus wore his Havaianas which snapped on negotiating through mud. He thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the trek barefoot though and his opinion, was much better than wearing flipflops. The trek lasted about an hour.The cooking class immediately followed. What I appreciate about the class is that although Balinese cooking and Filipino cooking have many similarities, I learned new techniques from the able chef, especially their traditional way of cooking rice. In the Philippines, cooking rice for 1.5 hours is unheard of but I learned that such was the Balinese way. I surmise that the chef may have had some Western culinary training which he applied in class. Again, we found so many common words between Filipino and Balinese-Bahasa and even exchanged some cooking ideas.What probably set this cooking class apart was all the cultural stuff infused into it. They demonstrated their daily rituals, explained their beliefs, and shared bits and pieces about their way of life. This was much more than a cooking class."

Our afternoon culinary Trek and cooking class with Lobong Cooking School leaves me struggling to describe in a few words what a privilege it was to do the river valley walk and then be welcomed into the family compound for a cooking class and wonderful meal.Sang Made led us down a path to the top of a deep river valley to begin our foodies trek. Immediately we were stunned by the beauty of the view. We would have been happy to have paid just to do this short trek down to the rice paddies and white water river.In fact our charming guide provided a wealth of information about both cultural activities happening nearby and the often edible plants and fruits that were always within easy reach. The climb back to the top via a very safe stairway was considerable but worth every sometimes gasping step.We were then welcomed into the lovely family compound for our cooking experience. The several hours we spent with this family were so much more than the excellent cooking instructions we were given by Dewa Jana (clearly a highly experienced chef with knowledge of both Asian and western food). Wisely his instructions and demonstrations focused on technique rather than ingredients. Recipe booklet provided later.Highlights of the evening were numerous and included donning sarongs to accompany the family matriarch as she laid offerings; explanations of family life; meeting other smiling dignified family members; natural fresh ingredients and \"touring\" the family compound.Finally once the 8 or 10 dishes and accompaniments were cooked Chef Jana beautifully plated our dinner which was than served to us by a delightful young \"waitress\".I suspect this will be the best meal we eat in Bali. Even a 5 star restaurant would be pressed to better the quality of our dinner. Overall a priceless experience which demanded respect and delighted our senses."

Then, went to a beautiful family compound (garden) for the cooking course. We learned how to make absolutely everything from scratch. The course ended with a multi-course meal of all the yummy things we had made that morning. Would do it again in a heartbeat!"

Sang Made met us at the markets and we got to learn about all the produce we were going to cook and meet all the wonderful market vendors.We arrived at the compound where Sang Made's family live and the cooking classes were held and we were amazed at the beauty of it.We met Chef Dewi, who has been a chef in one of Bali's best 5 star restaurants. He was fantastic with his fluent English and easy explanations. The day was full of laughs. We learnt all about the Bali family traditions.A beautiful dining table was set up for us to eat our cooking, and to our amazement our cooking tasted fantastic. We were sent away with cooking books and a little gift.I had checked out trip advisor looking for a cooking class experience before we left, I know now we could not have picked a better class. It was a five star experience from the moment we arrived until the moment we left."

Taken to seriously locals only market to look how they really shop and plenty of knowledge imparted and questions eagerly answered. This is a hands-on cooking course in a traditional compound. Many staff on hand and chef was experienced and very patient. My 11yo daughter cooks at home regularly so she was included and felt sufficiently useful. Be aware that when they offer you a beer with lunch that it will be added to your bill and is not included in the price. They charged fairly for the beer; this is just a note to remind you to bring extra funds. We bought vanilla, palm sugar and some spices for unbelievable prices, but be aware that if going onto Australia or NZ these will not be let in by customs. Happy to answer any questions anyone has, just message me."

We were lucky enough to do one of Lobong's new tours which was the Culinary walking tour (this was as a substitute to doing the market tour). The culinary walking tour was a huge highlight for me and my partner. Sang de (Our guide) knew this area like the back of us hand as this was his playground when he was growing up. He had a world of knowledge.\u00a0This is now my fourth cooking class and this was definitely the \u00a0best. Mata (I hope this is his correct name) was our chef and he was fantastic. A great teacher who loves his job. The food was DELICIOUS! Some of the best food we have had in all of Asia. They did not skimp on ingredients either, we ate like Kings and Queens.\u00a0The whole experience was very special, you are welcomed into their family compound and taught about Balinese traditions, lifestyle and culture. I would also not hesitate to bring along any male companions as my partner who is not a cook loved it, you couldn't not.\u00a0Every details was well thought out, even down to the special gift and book of recipes that you get to take home with you.\u00a0This\u00a0 is the best way to experience a place and a culture.\u00a0"

After looking at numerous reviews for various cooking classes, we realized that several factors are important: size of the class, location (home vs. cafe), and cost. Lobong limits its class size to 10, and we had a class of 6. There were plenty of things for each of us to do (though we weren't each making an individual meal- if that's what you expect). The chef was amazing and gave us instructions that were easy to understand- and more importantly- remember. The location also couldn't have been beat. The host family has a wonderful house, and the explanations of Balinese culture, the housing complex, etc. really contributed to our appreciation of the culture. Other cooking classes, many for a cheaper price, are located in warungs, or small restaurants, which I think would detract from the experience.The cost is roughly $40 USD, which we were hesitant about at first (other classes run as low as $20) but we think is more than worth it for what you get out of it. What it comes down to is- most anyone can run a cooking class. All you need is a kitchen and a recipe. Lobong manages to surpass all expectations with the presentation, the explanations, and the food. (the cook used to be a su chef and cooked for many celebrities.) If you are going to do a cooking class, you may as well do it right. Couldnt think of higher praises. Would highly recommend to any of my friends, and am going to send my parents when they come visit Bali."

There is an opportunity to see real Balinese life as its being lived. The information at the market and then at the family compound was amazing. I appreciated the chance to slow down and learn about a different culture and how they live their lives. Everything about this experience was authentic, from the market with all it's interesting foods to the smells (not always pleasant but real) to the family compound and daily life. Nothing is glossed over or hidden, this is the way the Balinese have lived for many years. Yes the table is beautiful and the modern toilet is appreciated but you still see the simple kitchen, the delicious, fresh foods used for cooking, the pigs in the pen and the chickens walking through the yard. As a chef I was impressed by the quality of the meal from a simple stove, including the wood stove used to cook the rice and the matron of the house making fresh coconut milk and oil for cooking. I received a great education on the food, the lifestyle, the spirituality and the home of a Balinese family. What a great bargain for the price and a fabulous meal and parting gifts as well."

Lots of information on lots of aspects of Balinese culture. Being in the family compound you are embedded in it from the offerings made after cooking to watching a priest conduct a ceremony 'cleansing\" one of the family members who recently became a mother. This is the real clincher for why we don't think this class could be beaten.3/ Good facilities, good food, small groups (we only had 6 in total).4/ A professional chef who is a good communicator and helpful about things from knife skills to different techniques of cooking.5/ Professional handling all the way from booking to arriving back at our accommodation.6/ Friendly and knowledgeable hosts at all points of the tour.Thoroughly enjoyed it - thanks!"

It was great to learn all about the traditional way to prepare an authentic Balinese meal and actually make a lot of the meal ourselves. While the meal was being plated up we were invited to the family temple, wearing sarong and learning how and why offerings are made.

Made picked us up at 8 this morning and we headed to the traditional market -- a real one, just outside of Ubud -- where we had a wonderful tour of all the ingredients and regular market life (it's where things happen!). Back at the family compound over coffee and fresh-made snacks, you learn about how an extended family compound is designed and operates. Mother shows you how to make fresh coconut oil, and then Chef Dewa gets down to business. I was surprised the menu was so extensive, but it covers all of the basic types of preparation and sauces & sambals, and we did them all without trouble -- including cooking rice over a traditional wood stove! They have added a clean, spacious facility that lets everyone particiate and dine in comfort, and with a maximum of 12 participants you still feel like part of the family. We had two kids in our group aged 10 and 13, and they were easily included in all the activities. While the capable assistants finished up the last bits, we learned about making offerings, tied on our sarongs, and helped mother place the daily offerings around the family temple. Then we all sat down to a 5-star meal, the best Balinese food I've had in 20 years of living here. Even the picky kids cleaned their plates! Made delivered us home between 2:30 and 3:00 with our recipe booklet, a little bottle of fresh coconut oil, and an invitation to come say hi anytime we're back in town. A memorable day."

The variety of items available for sale is truly mind-boggling. If you keep your eyes and heart open, you will learn much here. Our guide spoke great English and there was no problem at all in communication.We were then driven to the family compound, where we were warmly greeted and seated in an open pavilion. While we ate banana fritters and drank coffee, we were told about the layout of the Balinese family compound. Since it was just my son and I at this class, we were able to ask anything we wanted. Our hosts were very generous and patient in explaining life in Bali.Our culture lesson continued while we cooked. Since it was just two of us, we got to be very hands on with the entire meal. Each step was thoroughly explained, with our hosts consistently making sure we understood. They told us things which we could use as substitutes for those ingredients which are not easy to find in the US. We also got the chance to see coconut oil being made by the elder woman of the compound in the traditional way.Time passed quickly, and soon, all the dishes were prepared. Before we could eat them, however, we got the very special treat of being allowed to participate in a blessing ceremony in the family temple. We donned traditional garb for this event. Every step in this process was carefully explained, with the reasons and beliefs behind it.Finally, we ate all the delicious food we had prepared. It was one of the best meals I ate in all of Bali. Very, very good!!!When you leave, you receive a recipe book for everything you've made, and given a gift of coconut oil made by the family matriarch. All in all, an incredible day out in Bali. I highly recommend it to everyone. You will not be sorry. As one final side note, the compound has very clean, western style restrooms. The area for food preparation, and dining is scrupulously clean. No worries about \"bali belly\" here!"

This was the background for the fabulous cooking lesson which started in the local community markets and continued in his family home. Sang De's brother-in-law, Dewa, a qualified chef, took the actual cooking class. He was amiable and enjoyed a laugh as he involved us in each of the steps as we prepared the degustation lunch. The only suggestion would be that the experience would have been even further enhanced had Dewa sat down with us to enjoy the lunch we had prepared. Nevertheless, this was the highlight of our Bali trip. I'd strongly recommend this class. Oh, and it was the best meal we ate in Bali!!"

Pickup up from our hotel was free and we were first taken to a local market. Here, we were shown many local herbs, spices, vegetables, fruit and meat by a guide with very good English. We then went to the Lobong house to begin our cooking class. We chopped spices but the meat was already prepared. Each person (7 in total) took turns cooking the 9 dishes. Drinks were free the whole class. At its completion, we were shown an offering at a local temple before eating our creations. A parting gift of home made coconut oil and cook book with their recipes was provided. Overall, a very positive experience with just the right amount of involvement. Definitely recommend doing it."

We were unsure about travelling from Sanur to Ubud for a cooking class but so glad we did.All the other reviews describe the experience brilliantly. There is a great mix of cooking and culture, and the setting in the family compound is beautiful. The market visit was amazing, we got to see how the Balinese buy and sell in an authentic setting. You could opt in and out of the cooking process as you wanted, or just stand back and watch. The meal is served to you once all the dishes are prepared, and the coconut oil presented as a gift at the end is a really nice touch. Really highly recommended!"

The market experience was fascinating, we felt like we were getting to see some authentic culture away from all the touristy places. The family compound we were taken to was beautiful and the meal we cooked was the most incredible meal we had on our holiday! My boyfriend is a chef and he still learnt some Balinese cooking techniques (as well as having a bit of a cook off with the family)! I found it just as fulfilling with my basic cooking skills. All the participation tasks are nothing too complex, so it was all achievable and very enjoyable. I have seen some complaints that there was not enough actual hands on activity time, but that isn't the purpose of the day, it is as much a cultural experience. The family then serve you the meal you've helped prepared, by this time you have got to know the group (there were only 9 when we were there), so the mood is very festive and relaxing, with some beers available to order. Considering the very reasonable price of this experience to top off the great day, this would be the first activity I would recommend to anyone going to Bali! Thank your for making our trip so special!"

We were met by Sung De who showed us around the market and let us try fruits that we were inquisitive about. It was a great way to see the market and interact with the local people.We were then taken to the family compound which was a great insight into traditional Balinese life. We sat and chatted over a coffee and banana fritters (very tasty) and we learnt lots about the day-to-day life of a family.The cooking lesson was well explained, varied and interesting - all of the recipes that were given were totally do-able back at home. During the lesson we had a pit-stop near the bbq where we were served drinks and 'mangosteens' (picked fresh from their back garden as we had previously mentioned how much we enjoyed them).The food was incredible and we are looking forward to trying out the recipes back at home. This will be made a bit easier thanks to the little gift they gave us at the end of the lesson.I highly recommend this experience as a more authentic cooking lesson compared to the ones that are offered in a restaurant. It is also a great way to learn and experience traditional Balinese life - thank you for a lovely day!"

Morning market at Payangan was a great way to introduce Indonesian cuisine so I suggest you get the morning slot. They only accept 6pax so better book early. As we enter the Lobong compound, we were seated first in their hall for culture briefing. Good info and Sundey was very fluent in English so we easily understood whatever he's explaining. We were given drinks and Nasi Goreng (fried banana fritters), it was delish! It was an easy cooking class session, but also we were lucky to have good companion. Gained friends also (skyping til now). Chef Dewa and staff were helpful during our session. I also like the oleh-oleh (souvenir) :) Good job Sang Made family!

Our hired driver picked us up at 7:00 am at our hotel in Seminyak and took us to meet up with the class at an Ubud Market at 8:15am. We had a total of seven in the class. We toured the local market and learned about fresh ingredients used in daily Balinese cooking. We also sampled a few items. Once the market tour ended we were driven to the cooking class location and greeted with a drink of either coffee or tea and fried plantains. While enjoying our drinks, we were told about the layout of their home/garden, daily customs and other interesting facts of daily life in the Balinese home. The chef, who has worked in hotels in Bali, shared techniques of chopping, stir frying, grinding, and how rice is cooked. Everyone participated in the cooking and preparation process - and learned about all the ingredients. We cooked at least eight dishes in total - and after everything was done, we were served. It was excellent, and seriously some of the best food we had in Bali. I still don't know how they provide this class and make a profit. It's well organized, about five hours long, and very clean, and very professional. This is a class/day not to be missed. Very educational, fun and great food."

The day starts with a trip to a local food market (not a tourist one) then on to the family compound for banana fritters and tea/coffee. Then it is straight into the cooking - all hands on- with so much fun and laughter. The total group of 12 people all mingled and we learnt so much about Balinese food culture and family.

Being foodies and having a love of cooking, I cannot praise the experience enough. The day began with a visit to a traditional Balinese market where the first stall we went to had a fresh roast sucking pig on the table which set my mouth watering - for 10,000 rupia (just over AU$1) I bought a good sized parcel to share with Rachael. From here we walked through the market with our guide, Made, explaining the different foods and fruits along the way. This market doesn't usually have non Balinese visitors and I think the stall holders admired us with the same curiosity we did them, a lot of smiles were exchanged! From the markets we went to the Lobong Traditional Family Compound where we drank Bali Coffee, ate banana fritter and talked with each other and our hosts before the cooking experience began.We were given an explanation of the compound and a tour and along the way introduced to our guide's mother who was making coconut oil. The cooking class was fabulous, with each of us given a chance to participate in the preparation techniques from chopping, frying, steaming rice to grinding fresh ingredients for the curry and satay. We were kept engaged throughout the lesson with questions, smells and flavours.Once the food had been prepared and cooked we dressed in sarongs to enter the family temple to make an offering before we ate.We enjoyed the meal sat around a large table within one of the compound buildings and while we ate it started to pour with rain - it was amazing! When the rain began to encroach on the area we sat at, the family moved us under a larger building.The family at Lobong cooking were so friendly and explained the cooking steps along the way. We took away complimentary bottles of coconut oil made by our host's mother, together with a cook book of the recipes we made that day. Since returning to Australia we have made the chicken curry twice and had the satay tonight. Lobong have remained in touch with us through Facebook and have provided their email contact details should we ever have any questions - as they do with all of their guests.We'll definitely go back on our next visit to Bali - the experience goes well beyond cooking alone and remains long after returning home!"

Hospitality of Sang De and his family was special and more than we could have hoped for. A real Balinese cultural and cooking experience that we are so glad we did. We were even given a little gift pack to take home of coconut oil and a recipe book to ensure we can try to replicate the amazing dishes we helped to make on the day. Loved it, loved it, loved it.

They are professional and friendly and the lessons they teach you are priceless. During the market tour (morning class) you learn about local market histories and traditions. You mingle with the locals and learn all about their food and culture. On arrival the family home you are given a lesson on traditional family compound whilst you snack on deliscious deep fried bananas and locally grown coffee... all before you even start cooking.The menu is DELISH! and seeing the traditional cooking practices including bbq and cocnut oil productions are just a few of the highlights. You must start your visit with this tour so you are aware of the culture as you continue through Ubud. Thank you to the family of Lobong we had a very memorable time, Yum!"

The day began with a punctual pickup from our hotel, and to a colorful local produce market, where we joined the other 7 in our class and our host, young Sang Made, who guided us through the produce on sale, explaining unfamiliar items and their uses eg betel nuts, live eels, various chillies, different types of rice and the local favourite, pork, (a 'suckling pig' definitely too big to have been suckling!) cooked and served to the locals as 'fast food'. We were given the warmest of welcomes by all the family at the Lobong home, the geriatrics amongst us given special consideration, being past sitting cross-legged on a cushion! After refreshments and an introduction to their beautiful home, and some of the customs and rituals they observe, it was 'roll up the sleeves', aprons on, and we were into it - learning how to make coconut oil, preparing rice by traditional methods, chopping, frying, tasting, asking and answering questions under the expert tutelage of an expert chef, with many years of commercial experience. Our group included 3 from Canada, 2 from the UK, and 4 Australians, all of whom participated and cooperated well as a team. Cousins and aunts, brothers and nephews, all gave attentive assistance throughout the process and withIn a couple of hours, 8 different dishes were prepared for a fabulous lunch. This would have to be one of the best ways to experience Bali if your interest extends beyond sightseeing and shopping.Sang De and his family deserve top marks for the presentation of their culinary experience. It would rate as one of our most memorable memories. We are so grateful to them for sharing their culture and opening their beautiful home to us."

They explained a lot of things about the Balinese culture, about the market and about the products for sale there. It was amazing to see all the colours of fruits and vegetables and to see chickens in baskets\u2026after the tour we were given a bottle of water and were brought to the compound, where the family who organizes these tours live. They life in a beautiful home, were we were served tea and a sweet snack while we learned about life in a Balinese compound. The chef was a nice and funny man, who has worked in a 5 star hotel before. He learned us to make 9 different dishes \u2013 all delicious. We also learned some chopping techniques and tips about onions and garlic, which is helpful for Western cooking back home as well! It was fun to learn how to make these dishes and to see how the others got on \u2013 there were about 8 other people there. We all had our part in making the wonderful meal we would be eating later. In the mean time everything was thought of \u2013 there was room to leave your bags, they took moment for you to take pictures and we were constantly provided by water. Very well taken care off. The meal was incredible! Pork satay and baby chicken barbequed and cooked in the nicest sauce ever, and a lovely and healthy salad. At the end of the day we were given a small bottle of coconut oil and a recipe book so we can try to make satay at home. All in all a well good day out, highly recommended. "

It combined three elements of a good holiday activity: (1) a cultural experience; (2) it was enjoyable and (3) it had great food! The morning trip to the market was a great experience. Sang De provided very clear explanations and with a good sense of humour. Back at the family compound we took part in an interesting cooking class. The instructor (Sang De's brother) catered for all abilities, and made a lot of sense. His tips for 'substitute' items back home were helpful. Finally, once of the best meals of our trip was served up. It was very pleasant. I will (and have) recommend Lobong Cooking Class to anyone I know that travels to Bali. ps: I should add - the pick up and drop off-service back to the hotel made the whole outing a very easy."

I went with my sister, we were picked up on time at our hotel (slightly out of ubud, in the rice fields, this was a small additional cost which we were happy to pay), we then picked up another two girls and went straight to the local markets where we met our host Sang De. Sang De speaks great english, and provided us with much insight into the balinese culture. We walked through the markets and were explained all the different types of fruit and vegetables, grains, and traditions. We then went back to the family compound for some refreshments, which was a great opportunity to chat with the other members of the class and get to know them.We then met with the Chef who also spoke great english and he took us through the processes of making the balinese food. After we made all of the food we were able to do an offering at the family compound and were told about the traditional bali family life, it was all very interesting. We then ate our food, which was AMAZING and had more time to chat to the other members of the cooking class.Over all, it was definitely a highlight of my trip. The staff/family were all very friendly and helpful, and professional. Everything was done perfectly. My sister and I both agree it was worth every cent.To all at Lobong Cooking - thank you for such a memorable day."

We were picked up bang on time from our hotel and driven to the venue via another couple's hotel. We selected the morning class (8 am pick up) and were driven to the local markets where we met the other members of the cooking class who had been picked up by other drivers. We were met by our host Sang Dae who escorted us through the markets explaining the produce as well as how the markets are organised for the locals. From there, we were driven to his family home where he gave us the religious and cultural background of how a Balinese home is built and lived in. It was a good insight for a newcomer to Bali. Then on to cooking guided by one of his brothers, an experienced chef. Everyone had a go at helping make the dishes which we later enjoyed for lunch, which happened after an educational tour of their family temple. We were momentarily interrupted by a moderate earthquake and Sang Dae took great care to ensure we got into open space. Overall, it was a very nice half-day spent with very hospitable hosts. Would recommend it highly to anyone who has not been to Bali as an educational experience."

Our host spoke excellent english and answered all questions. Cooking involved everyone and all that we ate later was prepared by the group, even the rice was cooked by the group! (No electric rice cookers here!!)Techniques and reasons for ingedients were shared by the chef and there was always a little humour involved.When cooking was completed we were dressed in sarongs and we all visited the familly temple and the history was explained.We finally sat down to a meal to die for washed down with bintang that was available at extra cost.The day started at 9.00 and finished at 2.00 and the cost was $37.50 pp. This included a cookbook given at the end of the session.My wife is a chef and so found it of great interest. However I am a non cook and still had a great day. Great value and I would recommend it as a must if visiting Bali."

Starts with a pick up at my hotel, and a fantastic early morning visit to a market in the hillside near the family compound. No other tourists (except for our group) and no people trying to sell something, just a really interesting walk through the market, highlighting the produce we would use in the lesson. On arriving we had coffee and sweet banana (deep fried with caramel sauce). They shared a lot of information about family compounds, the way the houses are structured, the small details like how offerings are made to signify particular things within the compound. I felt quite privileged to be in their space. Cooking is part demonstration and part hands on, but very clear and easy to understand. the chef talks through alternative ingredient that you can use if the ones used are not available in your home country. I was more than satisfied with the level of cooking, even though you do not do everything yourself from start to finish, and I guess the cooking skills are not different, its more about understanding how to chop and mix the spices, how to cook them in particular order etc. after the class finished, we made offerings to the family temple, and then sat and had an a la carte service of the meals plus some to finish. the meal was divine. the whole day was completely fantastic. its low key, perfectly routined and i really enjoyed the understated yet polished delivery."

She was being dragged along as she isn't exactly an Asian food enthusiast like myself, but even she raved about the cultural experience we had at Lobong. The staff in particular were amazing. They spoke excellent English and were very gracious with sharing their lives and culture with us. The class is held in the families compound and the open air kitchen is a beautiful place to take a cooking class. And the food... well! Yum yum yum. From the food we cooked on the BBQ to the steamed rice cooked over the fire- it was the perfect balance of salad and meat, sweet and spicy.It was so interesting to cook with the ingredients we had just seen at the local market. We shared the class with only another group of two, so four in total. This was a stark difference to a cooking class I had taken in Chiang Mai where we shared the class with 23 other people and felt lost and confused the whole time! A must if you are in Ubud, not just for the cooking experience but to learn about the Balinese culture, religion and family ties. A really wonderful day,"

Visiting a local market, our guide explained all the ingredients we would use. Then, in the family compound, we learned technique for basic peanut sauce and Bali spice paste, and then how to use them in various dishes. Also learned how to cook rice properly. To conclude, we ate what we had cooked - a true Balinese feast! We learned about the offerings and the family shrines, the daily routine and obligation for offering, and about how the family compound was laid out - who lived where and why, and what other buildings were used for. We asked many questions and our hosts were very generous in sharing information with us about their lives and customs.Not for babies or children, or those who can't stand for long periods - you need to watch the proceedings, listen and take part to get the most out of it.Our guide spoke very good English, and his brother the chef, had cooked for 20 years in hotels - all in all, very knowledgable people and excellent value for money. It was, without doubt, the highlight of my trip."

Lucky us!The other reviewers are right on track with their comments. It is not a 'how to cook' class. It is more of a cultural experience. Thus it is fun for anyone with any level of cooking ability, although a basic knowledge of cooking techniques will certainly help. There is not much pressure and since everyone receives a cookbook at the end, one is not distracted by having to take notes during the class. The family is charming, welcoming and very eager to share their way of life with visitors. The food was interesting and very tasty. One of our classmates was vegetarian and was easily accommodated. I would take this class again.Be sure to bring your camera as there are lots of photo opportunities at both the market and the family compound. This is exactly the type of tourism business that should be encouraged all over the world. Small scale, environmentally aware family business with the money generated staying in the local community. I wish them every success."

Taught to slice, dice and pumile the assortment of spices we were soon covered in concentrating smiles.Giving the 'offering' for the food (and learning an insight into the Balinese traditions) completed the preparation and the taste testing began.

Decided to do the evening session, which misses out on the market tour but I'm sure equally as good as the morning session looking at other photos. The food was divine and I can't wait to have a go at cooking it in my kitchen.We loved the very informative talk about Balinese culture, which then helped us on other tours and gives you an insight into a totally different way of life than we are used to. It certainly puts things into perspective. The whole Lobong family are delightful and are on a winner with this business. We wish them every success and would thoroughly recommend.We had a thoroughly enjoyable time apart from the psycho, completely selfish, total nutcase of a 22 year old Malaysian girl who we had the misfortune to be sharing with in the small group of four. The Lobong family were hugely embarrassed that she had spoilt the evening for (which it didn't really, just gave us something else to remember!). Her behaviour suddenly changed after the food appeared, which incidentally she had been longing and hurrying everyone along for because she was hungry, only to turn it away demanding cigarettes and more alcohol. I might add, the Lobong family went out of their way to accommodate her wishes by going to several places to purchase cigarettes and without even a thank you. Her mood and tirade escalated after I politely asked her to stop blowing smoke across the table in my face as I am a non-smoker and used to Australian smoking rules, particularly whilst eating! She went off like a firecracker. We had to depart the table to get away from her and jointed the Lobong family for a few laughs to finish on a high. As mentioned, we did have a wonderful learning experience. LOL, if her travelling partner (poor thing!) has any sense, he will lose her as quick as he might have found her!!!"

We were picked up at our hotel (The Samaya Ubud) exactly on time and taken to the market at 8am for shopping before the class. The entire experience with Dewa and his brother-in-law was simply exceptional. If we ever go back to Ubud, my wife and I would certainly do this again! There are plenty of other reviews here so I won't bother with the details - I'll simple say, FOR SURE sign up for this wonderful experience! I recommend it far above any other recreational or cooking activity in Ubud. Enjoy!!!"

            "review": "Excellent Cooking Class with Balinese Culture Information. The team at the Lobong Culinary Experience are truly exceptional. The day began with an 8:00 pick up at our hotel, Tegal Sari, and then a tour of the small village market near the cooking school. The market tour was valuable, as our guide, Sundae (spelled incorrectly, my apologies!) speaks very good english and was open to answering our many questions on what the different and exotic food items were, were used for, cost in the market and clarifications on comparable items we might be able to find at home. He took extra time to allow us to taste and smell many different fruits and veggies. The Balinese culture portion of the day actually began at the market and continued to the family temple at the cooking compound. This view of Balinese family life was incredibly detailed and once again, no question went unanswered. Very well done! The brother in law, Dewa (once again, I am unsure of the exact spelling) is a trained chef with years of experience, and it showed. There was lots of hands on work, chopping, cooking, stirring and finally presenting the banquet...this is no \"sit back and watch the magic\" kind of experience, you are intimately involved in making the meal. There is a demonstration of how coconut oil is made and the detailed demonstration in the art of cooking traditional rice is fascinating. At the end, sarongs are donned and you witness the afternoon offering at the family temple with the matriarch of the clan. It's very moving. Everyone sits down to the meal and has a chance to visit and ask any further questions. We were each given a bottle of the homemade coconut oil and a recipe book to take home and we look forward to trying out the new recipes. We would highly recommend this culinary experience and felt it was well worth the cost."

This has to be our best experience in Bali in a long time. Our key hosts, Sang Made and Dewa were organised, informative and helpful and achieved their goal of giving us much more than a cooking class, supported by many other family and staff at their family compound. Our group was small, but diverse with the 5 couples each coming from different countries. The menu was varied to take into account vegetarian and 'no pork' preferences in the group. The groups are intentionally kept small so that everyone gets a hands on experience a few times through the class. Morning class includes a market visit, which is informative, but Dewa has the key raw ingredients at home to show you anyway. Great experience and great value for money. Subsequently, with Sang Made's guidance, we bought a Balinese mortar and pestle (fantastic!) and rice steamer (3 parts) to bring home. My first two days back at home were spent shopping and cooking. Australian Quarantine did seize my woven Balinese rice steamer mats, (infested with borers) so we had to have rice cooker rice, but family and friends have been very impressed by what we were able to make following the class using the recipes provided. The flavours are fantastic. We could not match Dewa's plating up though! Beers are offered with meals at modest cost. Must be one of your best and most memorable meals in Bali if you go. First class."

We arrived at the Lobong family compound (which is 5-10 minutes outside of downtown Ubud) just before 8am. That's when we met Sundae who runs the class with his brother-in-law, the chef. I'm not sure about the name spelling, but he said to think of an ice cream sundae - his English is really good. Sundae led us and a few other couples that joined on a tour of the market where all of our cooking ingredients were sourced. This was an authentic Balinese market. We were the only tourists there. We learned how the real Balinese markets work.After learning about the fruit, spices, rice, and meat in the market, we went back to the Lobong family compound to start cooking. Sundae's brother-in-law is the family chef and led us through each of the courses we created step-by-step. Each of the participants in our class helped cook one of the dishes or dish components. We learned about all of the ingredients and how to time the preparation - timing in Balinese cooking is really important. Before eating, Sundae led us on a tour of the family compound's temple. We made an offering, including small portions of what we had just created, before we ate. Then we sat down to eat all the food we had cooked. It was a great reward after a long morning of cooking.This is a family operation and you can tell. All of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The tour of the market and the tour of the family compound made me feel like my wife and I got a very authentic Balinese experience. Oh, and the food was fabulous!"

It was an awesome experience to go to a very local market, and then into a family compound to make a delicious meal. Highly, highly recommend.Lindsay"

This was the BEST experience my girls (ages 6,9,12) and I had the whole month. It was a fun and educational way to be able to experience traditional Balinese culture and learn how to cook some fabulous food at the same time. Chef Dewa involved the children in the cooking according to their ability, and made sure there was plenty of fun stuff for each of us to do. We were amazed at how delicious the dishes were, but of course we had help. Thank you to Sang Made and the whole family, we were honoured to be welcomed into your home. My advice for anyone thinking of doing a cooking class - do Lobong Cooking Class, it is simply the best. Fiona"

Lobong combines traditional cooking techniques at a traditional family compound along with some insight into day to day Balinese life.Our day started with a drive out to the family home where the classes are held, past the scenic rice terraces of outer Ubud. From here our guide took the group to a traditional Balinese produce market where we learnt about some of the more unique Balinese fruits and vegetables as well as getting to see where the food we'd be cooking came from.Back at the family home our guide told us about Balinese life and culture. We found out about the daily offerings, Balinese calendar, family temples, and various aspects of life right from birth.After the markets we started our cooking class led by a Balinese chef who had worked at some international hotels. We made several dishes including red bean and papaya soup, tempe manis (fried soy bean cake), grilled marinated chicken, skewered marinated pork, a salad, sweet potato rice, sambal, and a rice porridge for dessert. All cooking was done using more or less traditional equipment and techniques such as stone pestle and mortar, woven flax steamer's for the rice and an open fire for grilling.The best part came at the end of course when we got to eat everything we made, tasty food and a cold Bintang.The only thing I didn't like about the course was the fact that we shared cooking duties as opposed to everyone doing their own thing however this did make the experience more social. Other than that we found the guides and chefs to be very knowledgeable and helpful and everyone spoke good English....a great way to learn about the 'real' Bali that most visitors don't get to see."

This is the second cooking class we'd done in Ubud & was definitely the better of the two.. from the moment we got there they encouraged us to get involved. It began with a market tour and tasting some strange looking, but tasting fruit. Then we got driven back to the family compound and had morning tea!! Coffee and banana fritters - an excellent start to any day!!During the course of the day, we had Balinese family traditions and rituals explained as well as taking part in the daily offering. We made so much food, but they had us chopping and stirring in between the many photos and questions.. It was a great day and to sit down to our magnificent feast that we had contributed to was quite rewarding!We look forward to returning for one of their dinner classes when they commence in the future!"

It starts at 8:30 am in the food market and keeps on at the school which is located in a family compound. By the time the cooking (and eating) is over (by 1:30 pm), you will have learned a lot about the life, religion and culture of Balinese people. Highly recommended... ...even if you don't like cooking!"

My girlfriend gave this to me as a birthday present during our trip through Indonesia and we loved it. The guide speaks the best English we heared in three weeks Indonesia and the contents of the cooking course are sublime; really nice to see Bali's true culture when it comes to its cousine.First, we set off to a local market no normal tourists would ever visit. Face the numerous stalls that sell their herbs, spices, clothes and animals. You will see Bali's true local people here. Find the freshly harvested food here that you will normally buy at your local supermarket. Always wanted to find out where it came from and how it made its way to the shelf? Here is your answer.After the guide on the market we arrived at a compound of a pretty rich Balinese family, I guess. Explanations about food, culture and habits are easily to follow because of, again, the good English of the guide. For the Dutch readers, this person cooperated with the Dutch tv-serie op zoek naar geluk from the Tros and worked together with Danny the Munk and other Dutch celebs (as so to say).Anyway, after some introductory talk we started preparing the food. We made our own peanut sauce, sambal ulek, tempe manis, marinade for the chicken and many other dishes. Everything is prepared with coconut oil (of which you will get a bottle of 100 ml after the course, sealed and good for hand luggage) and they even show you how they get the coconut oil from the...coconut.After about three hours we were finished with preparing the food and before we could devour the tasty dishes the food is bleshed traditionally, like the Balinese do.If you are in Ubud then this is a must-do. It not only grants access to the Balinese kitchen and its delicious herbs and all but also makes you appreciate the food and especially the animals. Bali locals bless their food and thus also the animals they eat. It actually reminded me of the Avatar movie where they too, praise their animal for its meat.A given many a Western country has already long forgotten."

So much interesting stuff i learned that morning!After the market tour we went to the compound where we were welcomed by snacks. While we were sipping on our tea/coffee Sang Made once again shared his vast knowledge of Balinese culture with us and gave us a full illustration of the layout of his compound.Dewa, the master chef, welcomed us to the kitchen, introduced our menu and began our exquisite journey to a scrumptious meal. It was a very informative and detailed cooking lesson, fortunately, Dewa gave us a recipe book in the end so that we can remember everything we did. We also had a bottle of homemade coconut oil to take home :)This was not only a cooking class, it was also an interesting session of Balinese culture education. Sang Made was eager to answer all the questions we had related to Bali. Our chef was also well prepared and good in his expertise. And the driver was very cool and patient..

This is by far the best setup I have been to. This is also an excellent buy for your money. My friends and I were picked up in a comfortable, fairly new SUV. Our driver was very friendly and told us about various areas we passed by. We were let off at the market in Ubud and our guide there was very knowledgeable and a great teacher as well (and easy on the eyes). He was extremely charismatic and made us all very comfortable and welcome right away. He purchased items for us to sample and helped us when we wanted to buy fruits to take back. Once we arrived at the family facility we were completely blown away at the beauty of the layout! We started off with a snack and coffee that was prepared for us. The hospitality was just phenomenal. I am a very experienced cook. I was very pleased with the dishes we were taught to make. It didn't seem as though it would be too overwhelming for someone who is not so experienced, so I feel this is the perfect balance for all levels. The chef, who is the patriarch of the family, has worked in some wonderful restaurants around the world. He is very knowledgeable and explained everything we were doing so you knew why that step was important.We learned so much about the overall culture of the Balinese during our time there. That was such an added perk. It was very interesting and helped us to understand many things we saw during the duration of our trip. When the eating was done, all I wanted to do was figure out how I could spend a month living on their property and learning how to cook more food! They gave us a lovely going away present that absolutely made my trip! I won't say what it was so as not to spoil it, but they probably thought I was crazy the way I was gushing over it lol. All in all, this was an experience that I will always remember, and I truly mean that. I think if I ever go to Bali again I will do this all over just to go back to their home and learn a new dish. I cannot recommend this any higher....it is the best, I'm sure of it. If you choose them, you will not be disappointed. You can't even begin to imagine the experience you will have with them!

They arranged for free pick-up from our hotel to Made's house for the class.Guests are welcomed with a cup of Balinese coffee and then showed around the house. Then, the cooking lesson started by showing us how coconut milk is made. We were then shown the menu and the ingredients used (including explaining any alternatives we can use back home).We cooked about 5 dishes plus rice. The only setback of this cooking class is the lack of hands-on cooking. There is only two woks and we take turns to do the cooking. (In our previous cooking class experience in a Bangkok, each student has his/her own stove and wok).The menu does not change much as the cooking concentrates on Balinese food, which does not have much variety. After cooking, we were introduced the traditional Balinese prayers led by Sang Made's mum at their family temple (yes, each Balinese house has a temple within their compound).After the prayers, we eat!"

I rang once in Bali, and spoke to the very charming Sunday, who is the son who organises this cooking class at his family home. Sunday speaks impeccable english; he organised for driver to pick us up in Seminyak, drive to Ubud to see the produce market and then take us to his family home, to prepare and then eat a lovely lunch that we all had a hand in preparing. Even my grand-daughters, aged 5, 7 & 9 years were cutting, tossing, pounding herbs and were intrigued to see the making of offerings by Sundays' mother, and prior to eating we wnt to the family temple to place these offerings to the Gods.The combination of cooking, learning Balinese customs & understanding local produce made it a wonderful day. Lunch was superb. The cost of this day was very reasonable, considering the quality of information & experiences."

What set it apart was the combining of the food/cooking experience with understanding of the culture. The cooking included visiting a market so we could see the range of foods and how local people shop and then seeing the varus food being grown in the family compound: a paddy to plate experience. The cooking class was very hands on and Dewar is a great teacher. He respected the varying levels in the group and adapted the class to take account of everyone's taste buds. Sang Made was a welcoming and informative host who made us feel at home. Nothing was too much trouble and he filled in many of the gaps we had about Balinese life and culture. All five of our group highly recommend this class even if you are not that interested in cooking because its such an opportunity to join a local Balinese family for the day and eat great Balinese food that you've prepared. For foodies like us it was a great way to cook some authentic Balinese dishes."

The family give you a complete cultural and educational lesson on all things sacred to the Balinese. We thoroughly enjoyed the passion with which this was communicated, in perfect English. Absolutely fantastic.Initially we had reservations doing the course, as we had done a cooking course in Chiang Mai Thailand at a much cheaper price (and Thai food favours our palate more). However, we thoroughly enjoyed our evening - in fact we had an awesome time!!! Highly recommended!!! Lobong cutely mixes up the main host and the chef, which keeps the interaction fresh. The host principally teaches you about the Bali culture (a former Bali tour guide) while the chef teaches you cooking skill sets (a former hotel chef who also worked in Perth). The food was fantastic - the peanut sauce, marinated chicken and pork skewers were standouts! The desert was slightly disappointing - I have tasted better black rice pudding in Bali.The only advice I would give Lobong is that we were asked if we would like a Bintang with our dinner. Everyone in the group assumed it was complimentary, as it seemed to be in the nature of the offer. It wasn't. We were all given large Bintangs, which most of the females didn't finish. It's a small matter which can be easily rectified with better communication. I would have been embarrassed if I had only the correct money with me for the course. Rectify this guys, give a small Bintang complimentary. The class is priced sufficiently.Overall, keep up the enthusiasm, keep educating us simple souls, and enjoy the rewards. Your tour has been the highlight of our trip to Bali so far (even better than the many massages, and that says it all)."

This is one of the newest cooking schools in Bali and as a result, staff are very eager to please and make your experience as enjoyable as possible. I was incredibly impressed from start to finish. An educational trip to one of the village markets is followed by a trip to the family compound where the cooking takes place in the open air. Our menu consisted of a mix of 9 authentic local dishes with the most sumptuous of spices and flavours all chopped and ground by your own fair hands. It all ends with a banquet lunch or dinner (you can do an 8am or 3pm start) laid out in style in the family compound. They don't Market the fact that a % of profits goes back into the local community making this something of a social enterprise! Lobong deserves all the great reviews and is bound to go from strength to strength. Treat yourself. You won't regret it"

Chef Dewa was a very patient and friendly teacher, especially with my slow cutting skills! The dishes we made were delicious and easy enough to recreate in the home.

We (five) were picked up early by our charming host and first visited a local produce market to learn about the ingredients we would be using. We were then welcomed at the family compound with a drink and a snack before meeting the chef. He then supported us as we cooked nine different courses of authentic Balinese food! It was very 'hands on' and we chopped, ground, stirred and fried all of the dishes. This was fantastic as we learnt the techniques not just the recipes which gave us confidence that we can reproduce them at home. We finally sat down and enjoyed the fabulous lunch we had produced - after participating in the family's blessings and thanks for the food. Seriously the best peanut sauce and tomato sambal ever!While the food and cooking experience was great, what really made this a memorable day was the extensive understanding we gained about Balinese cultural life from our generous host as we were shown around the compound, family temples and gardens. We did this class early in our 10 day holiday in Ubud and it meant we had a better understanding and appreciation of the culture and people for the rest of our stay. A very rich cultural and culinary experience - do it!"

We took the morning class - starting at 08:00 - and went to the local market where we got introduced to a variety of fruits and vegetables. I thought that I'd seen all, but as it turned out, Bali has many culinary secrets that lie hidden in the local market! After the visit to the local market we went to the family compound. I was afraid that it would be another day of endless cultural introductions to temples and Balinese customs, but to my pleasant surprise, we were all expected to take part in the cooking class and stir, cut and bake the ingredients ourselves! The menu was finger lickin' good, and the explanations of our cheff could not have been better. It took us 3 hours to complete the menus. Then, we sat down to enjoy our lunches. Since Lobong only works with small groups, there is a lot of individual attention. Oh, and BTW: they pick you up from the hotel and drop you off after the work's done! I really recommend this experience!"

After careful consideration, I opted for the Lobong culinary experience, and the five of us who went all agree it was an awesome choice. We were collected on time from our accommodation by Sang Made, our host, who was a fount of information about Balinese customs and culture and cheerfully answered all our questions as we drove from one side of Ubud to the other to get to the wet market where we would be seeing all the foods we would be cooking with later in the day. Sang Made was a most solicitous host and quick to assist as I had injured my foot before arriving in Ubud and was having some trouble with steps. He also helped us to purchase fruit to take back to our accommodation later. Back in the car, we quickly drove to the Lobong family compound where we left the bustle and noise of the main street behind for a quiet, peaceful family home.Here Sang Made explained how Balinese families plan their living spaces and share with the extended family as we enjoyed a moring coffee and snack in a ceremonial pavilion. Then he passed us into the capable hands of Chef Dewa to start preparing our luncheon feast. One of the things we liked best was that, as we were a small group, we all got to have hands on experience preparing each dish rather than standing about watching one or two people cook. Sang Made later explained that his family's plan is to always keep group sizes small, to provide just such and experience. We learned how to make a base paste which was then used to flavour our other dishes, which were all surprisingly different. There included two kinds of satay (which we had made the peanut sauce for from scratch), a salad, a special rice, a Balinese chicken \"curry\" and a tomato sambal. The only dish we did not make ourselves was a black rice pudding for dessert. All the ingredients used were fresh and healthy with no commercial products used and as Chef Dewa has worked in Australia he is very knowledgeable about ingredients which can be substituted if the original is not available.Our lunch feast was served in the ceremonial pavilion after Sang Made's mother kindly showed us the Balinese custom of making an offering to the family gods of the food one is about to eat, and Sang Made explained the significance of the offering and the family shrines.After we were full to bursting with a delicious lunch, we were surprised and delighted to see Sang Made, Chef Dewi and other family members appear singing \"Happy Birthday\", complete with a gorgeous cake! On our departure we were each presented with a going away gift of the family's home-produced coconut oil and a recipe book containing the recipes of all the foods we had cooked.On the way back to our accommodation, again Sang Made was happy to answer questions and point out places and sights of interest and it was a most pelasant trip. The whole experience was a fantastic way to spend some time in Ubud and I would thoroughly recommend it most heartily to anyone who wishes to enjoy good food, good friends and sterling hospitality."

If you think this is just an ordinary cookery class you are soooo wrong! We've been in Ubud for 5 days and I've learnt much more about Balinese culture from Made in a few hours than in the last 5 days!! Dewa is a great chef, he showed us everything carefully and explained in detail the technique, told us all the alternative ingredients in case we couldn't find them at home and kept asking if we've had any questions.. He's a very passionate and genuine cook:) Made's mum made offerings and we were given sarongs to go to their family temple in the compound where we cooked the meals in the \"clean kitchen\". we were treated so well and got sit down and were served the food we had cooked. It was Enak(delicious)!! All in all this has been a truly Wonderful experience both culinary and culturally, the class of 6 people also meant that we all had the chance to participate in the prep and cooking of all the dishes..I couldn't recommend it enough!"

Dwar the Chef (Sang's brother-in-law) was instantly welcoming and explained what we would be cooking and how the morning would progress. The compound was extremely professional, great facilities with an authentic twist. We chopped, fried, diced and made 8 unbelievable courses. Cool home made juice and bottled water were supplied as we cooked, there was absolutely nothing forgotten.We were shown how the family prepare traditional offerings, and then witnessed Sang's Mother give the offering to bless the food we had just cooked. We then sat like \"Kings\" in a lovely outdoor area, the food is incredible ( and we cooked it, with help of course ), Dwar explained what we could use in Australia if we couldn't get the exact ingredients , which willbe really helpful when we return home.

I wasn't initially interested in Keliki lessons, but when I saw his work, I was blown away. Unfortunately I had only one day to spend but if I had more time, that would definitely have been worked in to my itinerary. Keliki paintings can be quite beautiful - what could be better than taking home something you made yourself? As an instructor, Wayan is kind, patient and encouraging. He steps in to help un-intrusively when needed, still giving you all the space you need to learn. The lessons are at his home, and it was nice to spend time in a traditional Balinese house. His wife was warm and his little daughter is delightful. It was a well-utilized morning and is the highlight of my trip to Ubud."

Since I love to draw and already consider myself a fairly talented artist (but with lots to learn), I jumped at the chance to visit the Five Art Studio when my mother suggested it. I was already enthralled by the culture of Bali and eager to pick up some new techniques that would help me to draw in the style of the Balinese artists that I admire so much. Wayan picked me up on his motorbike at 9:00 AM at our hotel, which made it very convenient to take his lesson--no problem with transportation. I found Wayan to be an immensely likable, warm, engaging and magnanimous person. He's an excellent artist as well. During my lesson, he taught me many new techniques and was especially helpful in instructing me about the use of color. He gave me some great tips about blending colors that will be very useful in the future. I was really pleased with the work I created under his expert eye and tutelage. It was an exciting experience for me to paint in a style that was new to me.Not only did I have a great art class with Wayan, I was delighted to meet his wife and small daughter (she was so cute) and to see how they lived in their rural home. I was really struck at how they live at one with Nature. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I'll definitely go back to see Wayan when my family returns to Bali next year.If you're looking for a memorable art experience in Ubud, be sure to try the Five Art Studio. I know you will have a fabulous day just like I did. Thank you, Wayan!"

The day was truly special and Wayan was very kind and showed us the steps along the way how to create simple Batik as we made our own masterpiece. Now I've done Batik myself I'm truly in awe of the fabrics I see around as you must be really talented to do so, first time around was very difficult and you'll need a steady hand. I was happy with the outcome. We really enjoyed a day out at Keliki out of the main Ubud town. It's always nice to support families who are a little out of the reach of the main tourist attractions in Ubud. Keliki is beautiful and traditional. Wayan and his family also support local school kids art and teach them art too. You can buy some of the kids art and the earnings go to them. I would highly recommend a day at Five Art studio with Wayan! Thanks"

The ride to Keliki village is an experience in itself (you escape from the hustle and bustle of Ubud central and get a glimpse of a rice fields and village life in Ubud). I enjoyed the painting class with Wayan who patiently guided me through the intricacies of the painting process. He also provided an insight into the history behind the Keliki style and the art scene in Ubud."

Luckily that day I was the only one and ended up staying the whole day at Wayans and his families residence. We spoke for hours about the world we live in, while I worked on my piece. As I am an artist myself, the work itself was smooth, giving us more time to let our conversation influence what I painted. We added critical details to the traditional painting, reflecting our worlds situation. It was incredible, a kind of collaboration between him and me. His wife and mother offered us balinese coffee and cookies and his daughter was the cutest. I enjoyed my day so much with Wayan and his family and will keep contact and definetly go back whenever I am in Bali. Highlight, You have to go!!Thanks Wayan!"

Wayan is great with children and he has a great balance between directing the kids through the art making activity and allowing them to explore the materials on their own. Many of the paintings and activities are extremely intricate - clearly designed for older children and adults - but Wayan has adjusted the activities so my kids are able to enjoy it and feel proud of their final product. Highly recommend this place for an artistic activity in Ubud. It is also a great opportunity to visit a family compound and look at the wonderful paintings that are there.."

This art studio is in the Keliki Village just outside of Ubud; a beautiful quick ride through the rice fields. It is in a beautiful setting.I have taken my daughters, one of whom is very interested in art; they were both excited to learn the technique that is typical in this type of Balinese art. The instructor is very knowledgeable and quite an accomplished artist.We chose paintings that we liked, and the artist, Wayan, taught my daughters step-by-step how to create their own keliki painting. I was amazed at the beauty they created by the end of their three-hour class! Wayan showed them how to draw, create their own detail and how to use the paint and brush effectively to make effects in shadow and light. Wayan is an excellent teacher. He is very accommodating with time and group vs. individual lessons. I would highly recommend this activity for children and adults who want to learn a real technique. My daughters like it so much they've already gone to Wayan twice and want to go to him again!"

And I am so happy about getting the option for a passepartout and frame for my finished art work. What a great memory to take home. Plus point is the pick-up, drop-off, snack and water. Thanks for the great day!"

He was so wonderful and patient with us. He helped when we didn't quite get it right and showed us that wood glue was designed to fix the bigger mistakes. Lol. We learned that woodworking is tougher than it looks and maybe the carvings at the markets are actually worth more. The only negative I have is that we had to sit on the floor to carve and for a middle aged couple that was difficult. Wayan's has a wonderful family and the snacks were delicious, especially the pastry. Thanks!"

The wood carving class was the best, the kids had the right balance of direction and independance. The painting class needed more direction for young kids. The biggest problem was that the wood used for the carvings was infested and had issues in quarantine upon returning home. But the family was so lovely and we really enjoyed our day. They cooked us a simple nasi goreng and we got to see the whole family compound. They also gave us free transport in a nice vehicle. Get out of Ubud central and try this place."

His family were very welcoming and friendly, with his wife offering refreshments and his friend practicing his English while we all shared information about our cultures.

Since I love to draw and already consider myself a fairly talented artist (but with lots to learn), I jumped at the chance to visit the Five Art Studio when my mother suggested it. I was already enthralled by the culture of Bali and eager to pick up some new techniques that would help me to draw in the style of the Balinese artists that I admire so much. Wayan picked me up on his motorbike at 9:00 AM at our hotel, which made it very convenient to take his lesson--no problem with transportation. I found Wayan to be an immensely likable, warm, engaging and magnanimous person. He's an excellent artist as well. During my lesson, he taught me many new techniques and was especially helpful in instructing me about the use of color. He gave me some great tips about blending colors that will be very useful in the future. I was really pleased with the work I created under his expert eye and tutelage. It was an exciting experience for me to paint in a style that was new to me.Not only did I have a great art class with Wayan, I was delighted to meet his wife and small daughter (she was so cute) and to see how they lived in their rural home. I was really struck at how they live at one with Nature. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I'll definitely go back to see Wayan when my family returns to Bali next year.If you're looking for a memorable art experience in Ubud, be sure to try the Five Art Studio. I know you will have a fabulous day just like I did. Thank you, Wayan!"

Once there, Wayan and his wife greeted us and explained the different arts (batik, kelitik, wood carving etc) that he is engaged in. He also took time to explain more about the Balinese houses. I took up Kelitik painting and his friend, Gusti, showed utmost patience and eye for detail as he supported me in my learning process. Both Gusti and Wayan are young, talented artists who showed sincere appreciation for the arts in Bali and talked about why it is important to uphold this culture. I have respect for the work that these men have contributed towards the their society. Enjoy your day (you wlil be served coffee and fruit juice!), immersed in art and engaged in good natured and playful banter with Wayan and his friends.

I was happy with the outcome. We really enjoyed a day out at Keliki out of the main Ubud town. It's always nice to support families who are a little out of the reach of the main tourist attractions in Ubud. Keliki is beautiful and traditional. Wayan and his family also support local school kids art and teach them art too. You can buy some of the kids art and the earnings go to them.

I was amazed at the beauty they created by the end of their three-hour class! Wayan showed them how to draw, create their own detail and how to use the paint and brush effectively to make effects in shadow and light. Wayan is an excellent teacher.

A fantastic lunch that she woke early to prepare and an all around pleasant experience! Would highly recommend this as a stop in Ubud. Also ask her how the interactive started with the support of her village and how she works with the local farmers. Brilliant! Also, take a few rupiah to get pure oils and teas."

The Health & Beauty Class, Short Walking Tour, and Coconut Oil Cooking Class. I really enjoyed all of them. The walking tour is through some beautiful rice paddies with lots of plant identification along the way, and a refreshing coconut to sip along the way. In the Health & Beauty Class, I used all sorts of fresh Balinese ingredients to create shampoo, body scrub, healing balm, and sunscreen. My favorite day was the coconut oil cooking class, out in the countryside where Dewi grew up. I think it depends on what you are looking for when you take these classes. I saw one review that mentioned the price seemed to high, and they could easily have looked these beauty recipes up on Pinterest and made them at home. My purpose for taking these classes was not simply to learn \"how to\" information for myself, but rather to have some connection to and interest in the local culture. I decided the best way to do that, is look at my personal interests, and then find local people with the same interests! The classes are a great interface to connect myself with the heart & soul of Bali. I think that is also a big part of Dewi's mission! Thus the name, \"Ubud Botany Interactive\". She is a lovely woman who established this like minded team and these activities for the mutual benefit of people in her own community as well as those visiting. She has a Bachelors degree in Botany and Agriculture from Udayana University in Denpasar, as well as a Master of Science in Biology specialising in plant biodiversity. Her heart is big, and she cares deeply about her traditional farming roots, her community and helping them, and care & harmony of people and nature! The coconut oil class was out in the rice fields where she grew up. Her dad is incredibly sweet, and will prepare some simple, traditional snacks, cut fresh coconut for you to drink, sugar cane to chew, and show you how to make coconut oil completely from scratch. Even all the tools for the process are very natural. He made his cooking stove from the earth. He fashioned many bamboo tools for the process you will use. He even made the coconut grater (which takes a day to make a grater). The whole day really touched my heart, and the coconut oil smells better than any organic, extra virgin coconut oil that I have ever bought. I could see that it was very precious to him. Not just the oil, but the traditional process of making it! You get to take your coconut oil home. The fields surrounding the scene included rice, corn fields, flower fields for devotional offerings, and smaller plots of cooking vegetables. I grew up on a farm, so being out in the countryside felt lovely, and reminded me of my childhood. My next favorite class was the Beauty products class! I hope this helps with decisions for interacting with"

Amazing experience. Dewi and Dhika have built a great project and have a real passion of sharing experience and culture. Not just a tour business but we did make friend!

The tour was formal and informal, we shared our stories, walked through the local area. Spent real time with local farmers sitting at the foot of their farm lot enjoying a fresh coconuts. We rate this tour and business 5++Stars. A definite MUST DO when in UBUD. The shop is nicely arranged with soaps, medicinal teas and oils all prepared by Dewi with the upmost perfection for purity.We\u2019re going back and this time definitely going to the offering tour."

We were amazed at how delicious freshly grated coconut and rice flout could be! We loved watching Dewi use a bamboo tube to fan the cooking fire. The end result was delicious and we are eager to try it at home. We also did the ceremony class where we made an offering basket and participated in a water purification ceremony at a temple. Dewi guided us through each stage of the ceremony, and provided appropriate clothing. It was a moving experience that neither of us will forget. Dewi and her boyfriend Dhika have a lovely shop where they sell wonderful natural skincare products they make themselves (the coconut face cream and hair mask are amazing!). They also sell wooden products people in her village make. Dewi and Dhika are a hard-working and entrepreneurial couple who are passionate about showing visitors the real Bali. Our time with them was a highlight of the trip."

            "review": "Fun time, but just okay. If you're tight on time, no need to prioritize this.. I really liked Dewi and her boyfriend who run this, so I feel unfortunate to give it an average review. But I would've given this a 2 star review had it not been for the fact that I do respect the local people trying to make a good living and the cause is great, of course. I also want to preface this review with that this is based on very high standards, but you might very much love this class.I did the natural product class with them. We made a shampoo, two scrubs and a sunscreen.What I liked: the scrubs were great and I also bought a frangipani lotion from their store that I liked.What I thought wasn't so great: I didn't think we learned all that much in this class even though that was the aim. We were basically given the ingredients and mixed them and that's it. That is really fun of course. It would be great for kids, I think but for adults who want hands on active learning, this falls quite short. I asked questions like what is the active ingredient, what is this ingredient for. Had I not asked those questions, I would've learned even less. But I think that should be basic information in a natural product class, what is the active ingredient, what are substitute options, what are the benefits of each ingredient and how they might be used in other ways, how do the ingredients work together, even how to pick fresh good ingredients. Secondly, we made primarily scrubs. Scrubs are the easiest thing to make, you can take almost any healthy ingredient and mix it with a textured ingredient like rice or oatmeal or salt and you have a great scrub, you literally cannot go wrong. So have half the class on that is really really basic. I think a good class should show a variety of methods of making natural products and a greater variety of products. Making the scrub and the sunscreen was basically the same process, which is mix in a stone grinder bowl. So that's 75% of the class. It's something you could've done at home looking up a recipe on Pinterest for 2 seconds. Making the shampoo was the most interesting part for me because I hadn't made a liquid before, but even the the shampoo we made still had residues in there because the process of removing the soaked ingredients left them. I think a true professional would not let there be so many residue in a product, after all, you wouldn't sell it that way, so why allow your clients to take home such a product.I still wished for something more complex, different processes, etc. I asked if they taught how to make lotion in the class, and she said no because it takes a few days to make lotion, but I still think it could've been done like you see on cooking shows where they show you how to make something and that it needs some time to sit in the fridge, so they take out another one that's been made before and is ready to go. Lastly, I just don't think it's great for the value. It's 300k for 90 minutes. Compared to other things in Ubud for the same value, it kind of falls short. 120k for a 90 min massage. 350k for a cooking class making 8 dishes. 450k to spend a whole day making really beautiful batik or silver jewelry. 300k to make such simple things for an hour and a half without a whole lot of education falls a little short."

Meeting Dewi, a delightful and generous girl with a big heart and the purest love for nature I have ever seen, was a mere coincidence which changed my stay in Bali completely. I came across her small shop in Kajeng street, Ubud, as she was watering her plants and instantly felt she is different than most of other shop owners in overcrowded but nonetheless magical Ubud. She invited me in, offered me some organic hot chocolate and coffee and started talking to me as if we have been friends for ever. When she explained her dreams and efforts to make the world a better place, to keep nature as it used to be and to help small Ubud farmers, who are more and more feeling the negative aspects of globalization, she deeply touched my heart. In her beautiful shop she organizes several workshops which you can attend even if you are alone - there is no timetable or minimum number of participants, which makes it a very personal experience. I attended a workshop in which we made natural hair conditioner, body healing scrub, face mask and skin conditioner with locally-sourced plants and fruit. She packed the products in small packages made of palm leaves so I could enjoy my \"self-made spa treatment\" in my bungalow. The next day she took me for a two-hours walk through the rice fields around Ubud and explained (in perfect English) Balinese culture and ceremonies, the everyday life of a farmer including the troubles farmers are facing due to globalization and her childhood memories. She grew up in the rice fields and her love for nature lead her to study biology. She explained the rice field irrigation system, showed me a variety of plants and how they use them in everyday life (the flowers they use to color textile, the bamboo they use for building houses and another type of bamboo they use exclusively for building temples etc.), we saw the avocado tree, clove tree, different types of rice, papaya, ginger, lemon grass and much much more. It was fun, educational, very interesting and really worth the money.Dewi is a lovely person and if you are a nature lover and want to see Ubud through the eyes of a local you should definitely visit her. She is like a ray of sunshine, with an open heart and big dreams, she helps the local farmers with selling their products (coffee, cocoa, oils ...) in a \"fair food\" manner and she is kind to everyone. She helped me in various ways and I knew I could come to her for advice or just a chat over a nice cup of delicious cocoa. I stopped to say hello every time I passed by her shop (my bungalow was in the same street), I met her cousins and her boyfriend, her mother made me delicious snacks wrapped in palm leaves and they truly made me feel as if I have an Ubud family far away from home. I will surely go back to visit Bali one day and Ubud Botany Interactive will definitely be the first stop on my list."

Along the way a number of trees and vines etc were identified and we said hello to a few of the locals. It was not a long or taxing walk, and as part of my time with Dewi was to create and understand the ideas behind the offering basket for Ceremony I purchased a sarong in one of small shops along the rice paddy path (that fits with the idea of understanding and appreciating the culture). The walk & talk, then the ceremony basket workshop was about two and half to three hours altogether. I learned Dewi offered a day trip to her village, which included a hands on Balinese cooking lesson and another day option is the Ceremony Basket and visit to the Water Temple. I did not have the time for that this trip, but will come back and do those day trips next time. Think of questions you want to ask about Balinese culture - Dewi is practical, very knowledgeable and determined to help the farmers."

I do believe that people like Dewi are Bali\u2019s future \u2013 if you can, meet her, support her, and let her share with you."

This was an amazing and touching experience that I will never forget.We were brought to the farm and home of Dewi where we learned about the farming and the plants of Bali. I was amazed of how many things you can do with plants, other then eating them. My girlfriend got a little cut on her finger, and they used plants to clean and stop the bleeding (it worked :) )We made organic coconut oil in traditional Balinese way, on a fire and without electricity. We tasted delicious fruits and food. When we were finished making the oil, we took one bottle with us home.One of the greatest moments was in meeting Dewi's family. They greeted us with smiles, hugs and open arms. You could feel their hospitality and genuine care for us. I felt that I learned more about the authentic Balinese culture from this trip, then from our trip combined to Bali.You encounter a part of Bali that has not been affected by tourism and modern society. One of the elderly farmers cried of happiness, when we were the first people to ever take a picture of him.This is an experience of a lifetime!"

We were given some traditional tools to cut, grind and mix the ingredients and were taught the authentic traditional way of making these products, which we enjoyed very much. According to my wife, the face mask works really well on her skin since she's quite sensitive to chemicals. The shampoo/conditioner is also wonderful as it leaves a pleasant flowery scent and we could really feel the difference on our hair.Dewi was passionate, sweet, patient, knowledgeable and she taught us many secrets of nature and how we should embrace it. We were so touched by her philosophy of caring for the environment and her belief in fair trade to help local farmers instead of making profits for herself. She's an inspiration and her cause is truly noble.We'd recommend anyone to try her fun classes and organic products."

Her educational tour about anything Balinese you would like to know was great. She is passionate about helping the rice farmers create a sustainable and fair price for their back breaking work we all take for granted when we buy cheap rice from the supermarket. She is inspiring to hear about her desire to create a business on freshly made natural, organic products using local rice. She wants to buy local rice for a fair price to use in her products. She grew up the daughter of a rice farmer in a neighboring village and was fortunate enough to get a scholarship and complete a botany degree. She was very informative about local plants and after the tour she taught me about local remedies used in Bali and we had fun making some of these with natural, local products. I especially loved her biodegradable bamboo take away containers for your products. A big thank you to her mother who made us a delicious local treat to eat on our walk. Thanks Dewi!"

You could do this cruisy stroll through the rice fields by yourself in an hour or so and be impressed by the landscape and scenery of Ubud but if you walk with Dewi you'll get a whole lot more.

Farmers have been working so hard under the sun from morning to night. However, they receive very little when they sell their rice, corn, or other fruits and vegetables...During the trip, it was after harvesting season and during Galungan celebration as well. That's why, I cannot observe the farmers in action :DMoreover, Dewi will share to you about her small project to help the farmers community.I wish you all the best, Dewi :)May you and your loved ones always be well and happy :)"

Like the other reviews said, Dewi is a great tour guide but more importantly, she is trying to build a socially responsible business that can preserve the traditional Balinese agricultural culture in a growing commercialized tourist area. The tour itself is about 2 hours long and is usually held in the morning when it is much cooler. Dewi was kind enough to take us on a tour after lunch since our schedule was tight. Her knowledge about local botany is impressive and her explanations about Balinese culture is fascinating. On the tour, we met a local coconut farmer who let us sample his home made coconut oil and gave an impromptu lesson on how to climb a coconut tree. It was quite an experience and one of the most culturally rewarding ones. This tour is great for anyone of all ages as Dewi will adjust the length of the walk accordingly."

This walk is a leisurely two-hour stroll along the scenic paths of an extensive area of rice fields just north of central Ubud with Dewi from a local farm family in a neighboring village. In addition to her practical knowledge of Bali agriculture from growing up on the farm, she has studied botany at university and biodiversity at graduate school, so she can speak about many aspects of Bali agriculture and botany from cultural, societal, health and scientific perspectives. In her promotional materials, Dewi says that she can tailor the walk to your own interests, and that is what we found. There is something for everyone. You might want to simply take a walk through the fields with someone who can explain what you are looking at. Dewi showed us many plants used in health and beauty remedies and explained how they are used (complete with recipes), demonstrating, for example, how to create your own hair conditioner in a matter of seconds \u2013 one of the \u201cwow\u201d factors for my eleven year old daughter. She also explained how various fruit, flowers, spices and vegetables can be identified, classified, and used for a range of ailments (with recipes too), including a hilarious story from her childhood about the care needed in balancing the special properties of guava and papaya (if you know what I mean).If you are interested in the social or cultural sides of Bali agriculture, then Dewi has something to say about that too. For example, she had already explained how the subak irrigation system works but as she pointed out the sole building standing when she began giving tours, she shared with my daughter and I how the society deals with members who sell or otherwise divert their land for hotels or other non-agricultural uses. She also shared her own ideas about how rice farmers might diversify their use of the land in a value-added yet sustainable way.Bali Agriculture and Botany Walk is more than just a walk in the beautiful countryside or a demonstration of plants used in health and beauty remedies, though it surely includes that. Imagine a conversation with a local Balinese as you stroll the rice fields of Ubud. If that is what you are looking for, then I highly recommend this tour."

It felt really good and the little break during which we got to drink a fresh coconut (with an explanation of how to drink it correctly) was amazing! Dewi, our guide, is an impressive young woman. Coming from a family of farmers (while studying botany/agriculture at the university) means she really knows her stuff. You can feel that she grew up with all of this and with the nature that surrounds her. I believe exactly that makes it so incredibly charming and interesting to listen to her. Whether she explains how she makes her own hair shampoo out of a leaf, talks about Balinese Culture or tells anekdotes of the Every Day Life in the Community - all of it fascinated us and it is definitely a privilege that she shared her knowledge with us. Aside all the attractions in and around Ubud - lots of them with a far more touristic feel - a walk with Dewi is what we were really looking for and what we always look for when coming to Ubud. A real taste of Ubud Life. And the best thing about it - you are doing good at the same time. What you pay for the walk goes directly into funding Dewis studies and helping her family. Definitely a Win-Win! Thank you Dewi - it was great!"

There is a place in Ubud on the main street Batu-Batu, it's not particularly cheap for Bali (there are places around Kuta that are way cheaper). Also research some ideas for silver jewelry the use flat not curved edges.

It was an afternoon well spent with souvenirs we will keep and remember forever.I was highly recommended this class by my friends Joy & Corey who took the class multiple times and made their wedding bands there and I am so glad I listened to them. There are so many amazing things to do in Ubud and this is definitely on the top of the list. You will definitely want to come back after taking this class and seeing the beautiful jewelry that comes out. There are no limitations on what you can create and the teachers help you make your vision come to life. "

The 3 master silversmiths want you to go away with a nice piece, so they help to correct errors and clean up the piece when you are done. We had a great time, and two large pendants cost less than $100USD. Not sure if we'll ever find another place to do this, so glad we took the opportunity when in Ubud. Loved it. Was this helpful?"

Wayan was very honest and upfront, letting me know if I wanted to proceed with my design it would cost more.I appreciated his honesty. To be frank, this class even with extra's is more than a bargain. You can find cheaper classes, but you aren't going to get the same quality or care that you get here from Wayan and his crew.I loved this class so much, Im going to try and book in again before I leave Ubud."

My daughter made a pendant. She did all the cutting out and the silver smiths simply soldered loops onto it, helped her add a chain and polish the item.Another 11yo girl travelling with us made a solid silver ring which she stamped with her name and engraved with a tree of life. It is stunning.My friend made gorgeous drop earrings with the tiniest bit of help... while I created a bezel setting for a pre-purchased crystal (from Batu in Ubud). I needed quite a lot of help because my piece required a lot of soldering but I still got to create the bezel and twist the silver for the setting.The staff were incredibly welcoming, friendly and supportive. Everyone at Chez Monique's was having a great time and every person there left with a beautiful piece of jewelry. Such a great half day activity that made us all feel very accomplished!"

It is weighed and they will give you a price on top of the quoted price. Still good value for a day of learning, creativity and fun. I spent $250 Aus.

Everyone was very helpful, friendly, and patient. There is a good teacher to student ratio so you never have to wait very long to get help with your project. When I first arrived, I was a little confused because I wasn't really told what to do and it seemed like people were in all different stages of their projects (I thought maybe I had the start time wrong!). I soon realized there were still people from the morning class finishing up and others had just arrived early. However, don't let this dissuade you at all or make you think things are disorganized. It really just has more of a feel of dropping into a studio than attending a class. Soon after that, Wayan (who is so nice!) came by and introduced himself and made sure I was comfortable. While I was a bit confused at first, the casual set up is actually really nice because you can really take your time and go at your own pace. There's no pressure to keep up with the phase of the project that other students are in, so you can just relax and enjoy! Don't be shy about asking questions either!My ring came out great, and I felt like everyone there was really focused on ensuring my piece looked as good as possible.

My only suggestion to improve it would that any extra charges are advised about before the process. My daughter used extra silver and it cost an extra $10aud but we were not told until ready to pay ... A small suggestion to make a great experience even better."

Me and my girlfriend came across this class looking through trip advisor and as lovers of silver jewellery jumped at the chance to make one-off pieces of jewellery for ourselves.We booked a place with Wayan, who was quick to respond to emails, even after we changed our minds about the date/time twice. On arrival at his workshop we were greeted by Wayan with a smile, a hug and a drink, before being sat down to look through his books for ideas about what to make. We already had ideas of our own, so after letting Wayan know what we wanted to make, we got to work. We had a go at every aspect of the process; cutting, filing, polishing and soldering the silver from the beginning to the end, while having Wayans three attentative staff helping along the way (doing the trickier bits and making sure everything was finished to a high standard).We loved this class so much, we drove back to Ubud from Seminyak to do the class one more time before flying home. It was our favourite thing to do in Bali. Wayan clearly loves what he does and after showing us the things he and his staff are capable of making, will definitely be keeping in contact to purchase from him in the future.Loved it, thankyou!"

After prompt responses to emails we were booked in to do a silver class. We are big fans on silver and decided to make our own silver rings. We were given a warm welcome by Wayan himself who is a very humble man who loves his craft. He gave us books to look through for inspiration and asked if we knew what we would like to create. Once we had an idea we were given the ring net after finding out our size. There were three very attentive helpers who helped us create our rings along the way. The experience was hands on and we were able to cut silver, file, heat, mould and polish the rings ourselves. We left for Seminyak and decide to bike back to Ubud to do the silver class one more time before flying home. Again, the class was brilliant and Wayan remembered us. This was my favourite thing to do in Ubud and totally recommend this class. We will keep in touch with Wayan and continue to create and purchase his beautiful silver."

We took advice from Trip Advisor to visit this place and it was well worth it. the location is a little off the beaten track and deceptively uphill so if its hot perhaps grab a taxi.We met the owner who is a really amiable freindly guy, and worked to create two rings that are a brilliant reminder of a great holiday.A couple before us created their own wedding rings, something really special if you're soon to get married!It's pretty cheap and the guys are on hand to help you create whatever you want, though be aware it's a lot harder than you think!"

Warmly welcomed all the staff were very friendly and helpful; we were shown books of designs we could chose or you can make your own design; which is what I did. I made a ring, I measured approx size of my finger and told them the thickness I wanted the ring I was then handed a flat piece of silver, my drawn design was stuck onto the silver and I cut out the cat face using a tiny hacksaw blade, I then filed it, I also used hammer and chisels to engrave letters on the ring and used stamps inside. Once I was done the ring was soldered together by the staff and oxidisation where I wanted it. It was then polished, staff started it off and let me finish the polishing and buffing. It was then complete. I was there 1hr 45min in total, total cost for lesson and my finished jewellery was Rp. 450.000 which I found reasonable and I tipped also. Staff were very patient; I did not think the end result would look so good but I'm really happy with it for a first attempt. I would recommend this for anyone wanting a unique experience, and for any level of skill as the staff will help as much as you require. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in Bali."

The kids were able to freehand their designs and make them into professional looking jewelry featuring original artwork. Even the day that Wayan was not there, the other silversmiths were wonderful, easy to communicate with, and knew exactly what we were aiming for. Other than soldering, they pretty much let you do as much as you want to - so you really get a piece that is not only gorgeous but for which you can take the credit. Even the pendant designed by my 8 year old came out looking beautiful. Great place to make a souvenir for yourself or a gift for someone you love. We spent 3-4 hours each time - depends on the complexity of your piece and how much you want to work on it. They let you take your time until you achieve what you are satisfied with. Two tips: 1. See other posts on location - google the silversmith class, as the store of the same name is in a different location. 2. It's helpful but not necessary to spend a little time before you get there thinking about what you might want to make and sketching some designs. You will be drawing the design on paper yourself, though, of course, they will help you if needed. We really loved the kids' original work rendered in silver. Thank you Wayan, Monique, and the rest of the staff. We hope to return someday."

A lovely typical Balinese walled family compound with a pretty garden, caged birds singing, and a lovely peaceful atmosphere. The owner is very friendly and helpful, and either gives you lots of help or very little depending on what you wish. I made a frog pendant and a ring, and did about 98% of each myself. The only thing guests can't do (understandably) is soldering. Otherwise, from designing, to drawing, to cutting, to polishing, you can do it all yourself. The jewellery is all Balinese silver - there are no stones or gems available, however, if you bring your own, the owner will help you set them if you wish (or do it for you). I spent most of the day here, with repeated free coffee topups. water, and a cool electric fan. The total cost for both of my pieces was around $70, which I consider a very small price to pay for the satisfaction of producing these items myself. I wear the ring every day, even now, almost a year later. In the afternoon, the owner even gave me a complimentary lift back into Ubud centre on his scooter. I would absolutely return to make more pieces - I am already thinking of my next design!"

I will definitely take this class when I am back in Bali, but am writing to recommend the class instructor--Master Silversmith Wayan Sunarta! I had purchased a unique silver and wooden bracelet in Bali several years ago, but had been unable to wear it as it actually proved to be too large for my arm. I had taken it to numerous jewelers in the United States, but none had a solution of how to make it smaller to fit my arm. I decided to bring it with me to Bali when returning there this summer, with the hope of finding someone to help me with a solution. Alas, none of the many silversmiths in Bali that I spoke with had a solution either--saying that the unique silver/wooden composition of the piece presented an unsurmountable challenge for modification. That is, until I found Wayan Sunarta two days before I was to leave back for the States! Wayan met with me multiple times in that two day period to ensure that we came up with a solution to the problem--then literally took hours inbetween his busy classes to craft a GOREGOUS etched silver addition to my bracelet which makes it fit perfectly--all the while, maintaining the beautiful artistry of the piece and making it even more lovely than the original!!! He did this all for an extremely reasonable price, and with such a warmth that I truly can call him a friend even after such a brief time of knowing him. He was determined to find a solution that would work, and is a true artist in his skill and craftsmanship. I finally been able to wear my bracelet upon returning home, and people literally catch their breath upon seeing it. My only regret is that I did not know about Wayan and Chez Monique upon travelling to Bali (I stumbled upon the shop on Jalan Hanoman by good fortune!!), so did not have the time to take his class--but will definitely plan to do so on my next trip, as I am sure it is wonderful! I also will be pondering on what custom jewelry I might ask Wayan to design for me, as he is amazing!! Thank you, Thank you!!"

Wayan and the staff are very welcoming, and they provide you with a quality hands-on experience. The finished products looked nice and were something we were proud to have made.Some notes:-CM has a catalog of artwork for inspiration, so you don't need to come here with an idea already in mind. Wayan helped with the planning process and gave us some good artistic feedback. -The normal amount of silver was more than adequate for what we made. Again, CM helps with the planning process and would let you know how much silver you need.-CM handles some of the more technical finishing work. This ensures the end product looks really good and probably helps with safety concerns too. You still get to do a lot of hands-on work too.-If using google maps to find the class, search \"Chez Monique Silversmith Classes\", which is located north of the palace. Do NOT search \"Chez Monique Jewelry\", which would lead you south."

Not only do you design your own piece of silver (e.g. ring, pendant etc) but you also get to create and keep it. You are not left to your own devices as Chez has a small team of silversmiths who are there to support you through the process. Chez is also very friendly and welcoming and his family's village is beautiful. Number one on my list of Must-Do's for Ubud."

He has a good spirit that made the 4 hours I spent there feel like a lot less. He really taught me how to make the jewelry and took the time to show me how to design, cut, sand and refine the pieces. I decided to custom make two pairs of earrings, even though they have lots of stock images and ideas you can work with. While I was there, a young boy and woman drew custom designs that Wayan and his team not only accommodated, but made fun. Wayan worked with both of them to make truly beautiful pendants. For what it was, the prices seemed very reasonable: $35 for the experience, and $22 each for my earrings. Wayan charges by the amount of silver used so bracelets would have been more.

If you fancy doing something a little different on your holiday then I'd certainly recommend going to Chez Monique and giving your artistic side a little workout. You design, craft and ultimately wear your creation with expert guidance.Our only small criticism was that we were not made aware that making a set of earrings cost more than the advertised price."

Of course the experts did all the clever work, while we had a go at just about everything, but they were there to correct amateurish work & end up with very professional pieces of jewellery. I'll visit this class again happily. Great value as cost includes the workshop as well as the silver. They have books from where you can get ideas on designs if required."

My pendant cost me $70 including the lesson but I used quite a bit more silver than some of the others so I expected to pay more.

Everything you need is provided, including lots of photo samples to choose from if you're not sure what to make. Good tools and equipment, and good tutoring.There is only one thing I would improve. You don't actually get to solder, one of the teachers does that for you. It would be better if you had the chance to solder under supervision.Anyway, apart from that it was a great day! I went to Chez Monique Shop the day before and took a photo of a ring I'd like to copy.

But once we got there, we found a cute little enclave of tourists happily working over their pieces of silver, under the smiling supervision of Wayan, the owner. My wife and I had opted to leave our new engagement/wedding rings at home for the honeymoom, jaunting through Southeast Asia, so we both chose to make silver rings in class, as \"substitute\" wedding rings.Wayan and his assistants were helpful and patient in guiding us through the process. I managed to cut, imprint, sand, and polish my silver ring to my liking. Even though I have my real wedding ring, I like to wear my handmade one, as I chuckle when I think about the making of it.Class is unhurried, and there's no pressure to buy/make more. Definitely memorable."

We are both incredibly happy with the end results and felt so fulfilled. Accepting card payment so was convenient for us. Some suggestions for improvement will be to control the size of the class to 5-6 so each student gets to learn properly, and involve more on the 2 nd part of the process too (would be nice to at least offer of student wishes to do the finishing our explain why they can't).All and all, a must try activity and keep up the good work Wayan and team!"

If you are looking for a great way to spend a few hours, where all the family can enjoy the hands on experience of making their very own creation, this is the perfect place. Wayan and his team, with their patience and guidance, help you create your masterpiece. You can easily while away a morning in the relaxed atmosphere of a traditional Balinese compound. I would highly recommend this activity when in Ubud. Very unique experience and great keepsake.Thank you Wayan for a fantastic day."

We came across this lovely little place in Ubud which allows you to personally handcraft your own silver ring. They do others likes ear rings, pendants and necklace but we wanted something personal. We DIY our own design of a heart shaped ring and the owner was more than accommodating to help us design exactly to our specification. It was not only the end result that amazed us but the entire process of making a ring from a single silver strip which doesn't look like much at first. The owner and the staff guided us through the entire process and made us the most cherished ring we wear every day. Thank you so much for giving us something so special to cherish for each other!!!"

If unsure or uninspired the staff have at least 5 binders full of great inspiration for jewelry ideas. They assist you to make your piece. You can also do as much or as little work as you desire. So you can be there for between 1 and 3 hours depending. It was fun and interesting. The only let down was the lack of formal greeting so I was unsure if I was in the right place. They also gave you very little assistance unless requested. The staff didn't monitor your progress, they did their own work and helped when asked. Which is good if you're outgoing, but if you're shy it might be a draw back. Overall it was fun and interesting and I would do it again."

As a lover of silver jewellery I was looking for a class which wd allow me to make a large ring - after exploring a few silver workshops in Ubud I decided this one might allow me to tackle a rather chunky ring. At first the assistant seemed dubious when I suggested my design but I persevered and agreed to pay more if I used more than the 10mg silver (most other classes offer 5mg for 350,000 whereas this was 10mg for 450,000). They also let me know that the design wd take more than three hours. I firstly flattened my silver plate then stamped letters into the band before spending nearly four hours sawing, sanding and polishing. I didn't solder but suspect I cd have had a go if I asked as I saw another guest soldering. The assistants who helped me were friendly and very patient, happy to reposition a copper bead when I asked! Wayan, the master silversmith was also on hand to give advice and chat to. He even made us a lovely coffee :) My large chunky ring weighed in at 600,000 which I think was a bargain considering the amount of detailed work that went into it - esp on the soldering and filing front. I learnt so much from the workshop and think it's a bargain when all is considered. Many thanks to everyone at Chez Monique - I'll def be encouraging fellow friends and travellers to visit."

I arrived :15 minutes early, walked down into the back of the property past a man painting and chanting and was greeted with great warmth by Wayan Sunarta. There were about 5 others from the earlier class and yet I felt very taken care of. I was offered a cold bottle of water and shown design books for inspiration. I was able to choose and design a ring I wanted in silver. I formed letters for a word to put on the ring and hand cut small hearts to put on the sides. I made a mistake with punching the letters on the back and they made my error disappear. I was able to watch them solder the pieces together and was taught how to smooth, buff and shine the ring. I was amazed that I could cut tiny 1/6 inch hearts out of silver with a handsaw. I paid about $35 US for the 3 hour class and also tipped 2 of the workers for their patient help. I would recommend this without hesitation. One point of note is that I chose to walk to the studio about 1.5 miles from my homestay. The addres of the class location is #57 an you might think it close to the corner but it is more like 5-6 blocks up the street."

Don't leave this to the last day you are in Ubud (as we did) because you might just want to go back again (as I did!)Wayan and his helpers run a relaxed silver smith class in Wayan's family compound. We felt at home as soon as we entered and were greeted by his wife, Monique! Firstly you choose and draw a design, we copied ours from the books of examples. Then you are assisted in all the elements of bringing that pencil drawing into reality.The helpers are very patient and one of them did such a great job with my 8 year old. They explained all the steps well and even were able to correct any mistakes you might have made. My daughters loved helping to operate the soldering iron by pumping the bellows. It is not a rushed atmosphere but stay as long as you like and take your time.Wayan happily shared his business story and showed us the types of jewellery he exports all around the world.His home is away from the main streets of Ubud so quiet and tranquil. There is a map on his store door in town to show you the way.So make sure you do this when in Ubud, I certainly will be back."

After that, they taught us step by step by demonstrating themselves. They were also walking around to help when we meet problems. We spent only 2 hours to make 2 rings. It was definitely a great experience to us!  Cost was agreed as Rp 900,000 for two while booking. However, based on the design of work, we had to topped up additional Rp 100,000. Anyway, I think it was still a reasonable price for 926 grade silver rings."

The first step is that you choose a template of theirs or sketch your own and decide what type of jewelry you want to make. Next, they tape the sketch onto a piece of metal and then you hit that piece of metal with a hammer to make the design. Next you have to use a thin wire cutter thing to cut out the design. This was sooo difficult. We kept breaking ours and felt very bad. Next you buff the sides until it is smooth. Then they take it and burn the final pieces onto the jewelry to make them wearable. I really really enjoyed this and it was one of our highlights of Ubud. They are extremely helpful if you have any problems with any of the steps."

Mr. Wayan Sumatra, an expert Silver Smith himself, runs this and he couldn't more hospitable to accommodate guests to his classes. This is not your run of the mill workshop / class or a standard tourist trap where everyone just flock to get some pictures. This is a place where you can actually get to know how a jewellery is made right from the design on a piece of paper until the finishing stages. Typically takes about 3- 4 hours of your time and you will be either asked to select one of the many designs already in the book or if you have any of your own creative ideas, you can draw them on a piece of paper and they will help you materialize it in the form of a jewelry. While my wife decided to go with a standard design off the book, i surprised her by making her a minion pendant (she's a big fan). Right from booking over the phone and during the class, Wayan & his staff were very helpful and attentive enough to help create our jewelry. We both enjoyed the whole process and we would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Ubud."

My friend Jack and I found this via Tripadvisor and couldn't be happier about our decision to go, especially during such a crazy busy touristy time to visit! Note: Be sure to go to the studio location and not the shop address! However, they're fortunately not far from each other and you can even go to the shop to pay with a visa after! When we arrived we walked into a place of wonderfully positive energy with smiling faces, 3-4 other people hard at work on their silver creations, and colored little chicks running around! Wayan was INCREDIBLE and so encouraging of you doing as much of the work as possible--including drawing your piece yourself! I'm crafty but have never done anything like this and am far from a drawing artist. The employees were so lovely and encouraging! During our 2.5 hours there we were served water and coffee and Wayan set my sit for lengthy periods of time! Everyone always checks in on your work, and you know that you'll never leave with something mediocre-looking! It is a true testament to the company that every patron in the open air studio with us had been there previously! I would've been a \"repeat creator\" as well if I had more time! Wayan even helped me create another necklace out of the recycled silver from my original pendant! This place is a true gem and I sent everyone I met on my Bali travels to make their own unique, everlasting memory in Ubud here! Four friends that I know of attended the studio thus far and had the same glowing reviews! A quote from Wayan as he was connecting two of my silver pieces together: I love my job. I make new friends like you every day. That warms my heart and says it all."

We had had a look on Pinterest the night before and saved some photos of some ring designs we liked (I would recommend this however there is a book with designs for you to choose from if you aren't feeling as creative). After deciding what we were going to make Wayan came over and introduced himself to us and the silversmiths. The were incredibly patient and even when I said I got stuck on occasion and asked for help they always showed me the correct way and then handed the item back to me rather than taking over. They do the soldering but everything else is down to you even the polishing at the end!I would highly recommend this class even if you aren't a particularly arty type it doesn't matter they will help you until you have a finished product and lasting memory of Ubud! Please note the location was a little tricky to find, on google maps the Kecak fire and dance temple is on the same street, you need to keep waking up this street for around 10 mins as the silversmith workshop is near the top of the road, this wasn't made clear when were handed the business card with the location in the shop."

The experience itself was one of a kind, and weather you are a beginner in the silversmith world (as I was) or a jewelry maker (as another fellow-classmate was), it is easy to make the jewelry as simple or as complicated as you'd like it to be. So much freedom and self-expression. I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Ubud, whether you are with others or traveling alone - you meet plenty of people there too.

We designed our own pieces and I was surprised by how much of the work we were allowed to do ourselves (although reading other reviews, other people seem to have had quite different experiences in this regard, so not sure how variable this is). Staff were really friendly and helpful, and good at suggesting improvements to our design. Also very kind when it came to my dreadful craftsmanship. \"You can tell it's handmade.\" You certainly can. Points to note: The workshop is not at the same place as the chez monique shop. It is about ten minutes walk from the palace. Easy to find though. It's really worth thinking about what you are going to make before you go. Have some designs in mind, do some sketches to take along and I think you'll get more from the experience."

Really amazing experience. Me and my family had a wonderful time at the workshop and had a great time. I was incredibly pleased with my final product and will be wearing them everyday! Loved it! They have these wonderful books full of beautiful ideas for the jewelry you can make. But also, you can make whatever you want! They can help you with it and every single product that comes out of the workshop looks like a professional did it, when it, in fact, came from your own hands. We all loved the workshop so much that we went twice in the same week! At the end of my vacation, I ended up with two beautiful necklaces, one was Yin and Yang and the other necklace of Buddha, both perfectly representing me and what I love and cherish. It was magical! I loved this so much. Plus, if you mess up (like I did a couple of times....) they can fix it and make it beautiful, looking like there was never a mistake.The people there are SO nice. It was a wonderful experience. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.So, if you guys happen to be Bali, Ubud, then you should DEFINITELY go to this workshop. Incredible. I loved it so much. Great memories there.Will definitely be back there again!Love it so much! <3 <3"

I do silver smiting at home in Melbourne and wanted to learn how to set a stone in a ring I had designed. I had recently attended a 2 day course in Melbourne and they were unable to help me, which is why I thought i would try when I was in Ubud. Wayane and his team looked at the design, the silver and stone I had taken along and after 5 minutes of rapid discussions between themselves they had determined the best approach.For the next 3.5 hours we cut, filed, soldered, polished and set the stone. Because I have worked with silver before they were more than happy to let me do as much as I wanted along the way and answered all of my endless questions.By the end of the day I was so excited about the ring I had made and the amount of new skills I had learned, I went off to buy myself another stone at a local store and then went back the day after to make another ring. I learned more in these 2 half days than I could ever have hoped to and have come back with so many new skills.I already have plans to head back to Ubud in a few months to do some more silver work with Wayan and his team.Whether you are new to silver work or have done some before Wayan and his team will look after you and ensure you have a fantastic time while creating something unique to you."

My husband and I were recently in Ubud for 4 days and we decided to do a silver class after visiting the Chez Monique shop.The lady at the store was lovely, ringing to make sure we could go at a time that suited us. She suggested taking photos of what we might like to make to save time when we got to the class. We showed up at the workshop and it was a traditional Balinese home. We were unsure if it was the right place but we were waved in, so off we went. We were greeted by Wayan with a big hug as if we were old friends.We showed him the designs that we wanted to make and he put us to work sketching our designs, with a promise to help if we couldn't do it. After our sketches had passed scrutiny we were off to bring them to life.With Wayan's help, and the help and patience of his two other workers, our designs became jewellery. It was a really great way to spend an afternoon. Learning and creating something that we would never do at home was very rewarding and completely do-able even for us beginners! If you're done with the same old tourist traps I would definitely recommend spending an afternoon at Chez Monique."

We were lucky some folks were finishing and they had space for our family (hubby and myself & 8 yo + 5 yo). They were readily helping our young kids with design ideas and throughout the entire process.

Wayan and his team are amazingly talented, kind, friendly and very patient. I wish I could have stayed in Bali and taken more classes. I was so thankful for the support - the team was ready to show me how to do what I needed to do, and in some cases help me finish when I got frustrated and couldn't saw anymore. I'm so thrilled with my creations and I think of Wayan and the team every time I wear them.

You really do get to complete quite a lot of the work yourself so at the end when you have your completed product you really feel you have been helped to create something special. We all had fun and all of the team are very helpful throughout the entire process, I highly recommend this activity! Thank you so much Wayan and team, Terimah Kasih !"

Because it got such great reviews we decided to give it a try. We had a wonderful time learning how to make silver. We were both surprised at how hands-on the class was. All of the silversmiths including owner Wayan Sunarta showed us the basic techniques and methods, but really let us do most of the work! We couldn't have been more pleased with our experience at Chez Monique and hope to visit again one day. We would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning the art of silversmithing. The people were great and we got to take home our very own handcrafted pieces of silver!"

I didn't take your own design with me, so I looked through their many books for inspiration. I drew my design on paper which was used as a template. I was instructed on how to cut, saw, file and polish my necklace, which I did myself with guidance. I recommend arriving on time (or slightly early), as if you get there before others, you will get more one on one time which is good to get started. The classes are restricted to small numbers and take place in a family compound.Staff are very welcoming, helpful and supportive, water is provided and facilities are very clean. Highly recommend."

The atmosphere is so tranquil and relaxed that even the least artistic person will enjoy the creating of their own piece of unique jewellery. The quiet, gentle, patient but highly professional guidance and assistance that is given by various in-house artisans at any time during the process, the lack of being rushed by time restrictions and the vast choices of items made in this class create an unforgettable experience. Whilst her husband was looking after all the students on an individual basis Monique quietly replenished vases brimming with colourful flowers and offered us bowls of delicious exotic fruits, which to some visitors was an adventure in itself. Spotlessly clean bathroom facilities were available to us. I will definitely return for my next design on my next trip to Bali. The trip to Ubud is worth it from any location in Bali just for this joyful activity. Go! Go! Go!P.S.: I am really not artistic at all but I am quite proud to show off my finished product."

During our short trip to Bali, Chez Monique workshop was the number one thing my husband and I wanted to do on our short to do list, and it certainly did not dissapoint! Wayan was the perfect host and teacher! Initially we had organised a 1:30 pm class two weeks before arriving in Bali but due to last minute changes to our schedule I had to request an earlier class, I emailed Wayan the night before and he emailed back with a reply straight away.  The class was very hands on (which is what I loved about it) and wayan and his team was always there to help us when needed. We were guided and shown each step of the way but if there was a process I wasn't confident in (for me it was soldering and machine polishing) they were happy to complete the process for me. A good tip would be to come prepared with a design in mind. But even if you haven't or you happen to be uninspired or artistically challenged. Wayan provides plenty of photographed designs to inspire you or to copy from. We ended up with great results and it was so much fun! I would definitely do it again next time we visit Bali!"

You are greeted by an extremely friendly owner, who gives you books of designs to look through. Comes back and says what do you want to make. We chose rings, he gives you the size rings to try, then his silversmith goes off the cut the silver. I was waiting for the class, he takes you to a table, gives you a hammer, and some stamps, \"bangs one on a test piece and says, you do this to try and walks off. That was the class. The rest is done by his staff, I would have liked to have more of a class, we actually followed his staff around until one gave in and let us polish our end results.Nice rings, I have never worn silver before but mine is so scratched after 1 month I don't wear it anymore.He must make a lot as you have to get your own way there, nothing included but the silver and water and its in his home so he's not paying rent, and only 2 staff, there were 12 on the day we were there."

The family will help with attaching earring stems and pendant loops, removing the paper and they will show you how to use all of the tools to complete the work. Very kind, encouraging and talented family!

I took an opal in a very old setting that I had for years and Wayans assistant helped me to reset it into a modern ring that I have worn every day since the class. I absolutely love it!! My husband made me a beautiful silver pendant In a wave pattern that is so professional looking people do not believe that he made it.

Which given my lack of skills with handy crafts was one of fears . Great experience.

We often get so bored of all the touristattractions since all companys offering or selling exactly the same activitys or things instead of doing something diffrent and uniq, to stand out from everyone else. We found this lovely little silver smith class and was very exited when we arrived. We did not get dissapointed! We have been travelling for almost 6 months with so much funny and beautiful memories. But I got ill and we both had a great loss and decided to stay in Ubud to heal and sorrow. So this was an activity to try to distract our feealings just for a moment. We didn't know when we arrived what we wanted to do and they had tons of pictures to look at for inspiration. When we sat down an idea started to grow of making a symbol for all our memories from this trip, both the good and the more sad ones. It ended up in two identical rings for me and my fiance with a secret inprint in the second language in New Zealand, maori. I added the infinity symbol to mine otherwise they look exactly the same. It became such a beautiful and touching memory for us that we have to quietly cry a bit before we started. The staff is so friendly and really helpful. You can see that they enjoy doing this and the class is held in their own home. We felt very welcome and the english was exeptionally good. If you want to do something completly diffrent comparing to the \"normal\" touristy things, then this is it. Go ahead and create a memoriy that for sure will last forever. /Linn & Mattias, Sweden"

We were told it would take about 3 - 4 hours. There were four of us, two teenagers and two mums. We were greeted by welcoming hugs and bottles of water. The class is conducted in an affluent family compound outside of the shopping area of Ubud. We were provided with books showing various rings, bracelets and pendants. There were two other teachers and two other customers. Three of us chose bracelets and one chose a ring found on the internet. We were helped throughout the process but must admit chose not to do too much ourselves. There is only so much you can do in four hours plus we were a little tired. I found that they worked with you as one the other customers was much more hands on. It's up to you. The end product was great and I paid a little more for mine as I made a bangle which was much bigger that the others. We loved our finished products. The owners wife even brought out some spring rolls as it was close to dinner time. As I said in the beginning this is a family compound so expect the extended family to act as if you're not there. We saw Uncles, cousins and grandparents which was lovely. We even saw a cousin going to have a shower in his jocks. We were thankful he had them on. LOL. Note: If you do not have cash you are asked to walk to the store which is in the shopping precinct about 25 minutes away as we had difficulty finding it, to process your credit card. There is some great jewellery and restaurants here. Give it a go and you'll end up with a great piece of jewellery!"

You get to pick a design and work on it for a couple of hours all the while with expert advice and assistance through the process.The class really isn't a group class though their are times listed. We arrived at the class start time and others were already working on their projects so it feels more like one-on-one tutoring. If you pick a more complex design, you will need more assistance unless you have previous experience. Also if you select a more complex pattern, you will probably end up paying more than the stated class price as there will be more silver required.A really interest and different experience all in all and we would definitely recommend this to others."

They will help you by telling you how fasteners will be affixed and how that could change the design as well. You can also stamp lettering into your jewellery I chose Bali Nov 14!

Good thing is they let you do most of the work and only jump in to help you if you have difficulties, or giving your jewelry the last few % to make it perfect. The end product we came out with was definitely sell-worthy.Two minor drawbacks for which I deduct one point:1. In the design phase in the beginning, I specifically asked to use just as much silver to be fully covered by the standard fee, but was still charged 100k IDR more. I probably would have left it as tip anyways, but feel somewhat ripped off since I specified in the beginning that I would like to be covered by the standard rate2. The designs you see don't tell anything about difficulty or involved steps. Since this is a class and people enjoy the process, it would be great to know before choosing the design how the process would roughly look likeOverall would definitely recommend, but be sure to communicate well during design phase since that will determine how your whole class looks like."

I have spent the last 7 weeks in-and-out of Ubud and Chez Monique is where I've spent most of my time. I am a jewelry designer, and originally, I came to Bali to find inspiration and make pieces for my new series. Wayan, his family, and metal smiths welcomed me into the studio with open-arms, compassion, and a whole lot of patience. In every visit, I have been treated so well by Wayan, Mogi, & Eco, who have made my silversmithing dreams come to life. My experiences at Chez Monique have been and continue to be so enjoyable. They are very active and considerate of any design/creation, no matter how difficult or simple. The studio is very unique, as it is located in the family's compound. A true Balinese experience you cannot miss out on! I am so thankful of Wayan, his family, and team. I have learned so much from them about silversmithing and also about the Balinese culture as a whole. I hope to continue to return to Chez Monique in the future! Love to this blessed family & sacred studio :) Namaste!"

We were made to feel very welcome and received bottled water before we began the course. The main jeweller chatted with us first of all and then discussed with us what exactly we wanted to make. The simple hammered rings that we had decided on were relatively easy, but we still had plenty of guidance from the instructors who constantly wandered around to check on our progress and offer help and guidance. At the end of the afternoon, we had produced two lovely silver rings with an engraving on the inside of each. Although we were complete beginners, we were surprised at how \u201cprofessional\u201d our rings looked. Our experience at Chez Monique was memorable and enjoyable, particularly because of the relaxed atmosphere in the class. The course was well suited to beginners, as well as people with some experience of silver work. I would highly recommend it to anyone with an artistic flare or just some who wants to try something new in Ubud."

After a warm greeting, Wayan asked us to pick out a design we liked and proceeded to teach us the ABC's of working with silver. If we ran into trouble, he or one of the other silversmiths helped us out. In the end, we both had finished creations to take home. I would definitely recommend this as a fun way to spend a couple of hours - I mean when else are you going to have this kind of unique experience and get to learn and appreciate the art of working with silver?"

It was a truly unique and personal experience designing and producing a piece of jewellery to take home. Everytime I look at the ring on my finger I am reminded of my trip to Bali. After a long walk I was greeted with water and a seat in front of the fan while I flipped through their idea books. I then got to work making my piece, being shown what to do and then given the opportunity to do it myself. I'd recommend this class to anyone - such a different experience than all the normal 'tourist' stuff. Loved it!"

Stupidly, I didn't contact Wayan until our last day but he managed to squeeze us in that afternoon - and I'm so glad he did! The compound is a nice 10-15 minute slow stroll from central Ubud. It is interesting to see how a Balinese family lives and you are greeted with a warm smile and hug from Wayan, plus a welcome cold drink! There are tons of books of designs to look through for inspiration, or you can sketch your own design out. In all honesty, Wayan and his team do hold your hand quite a lot and do some of the trickier work like welding, but you do most of the basics yourself and it's super satisfying to help create something that turns out so beautifully! I made some long earrings that look a bit like leaves on a stem and my boyfriend made some smaller ones in an elegant, classic design. We were both very pleased with the end result and for the equivalent of about \u00a320 each are taking home a lovely handmade gift for our mums. The other people at the class were lovely and all enjoyed it too. The creations were all great - you don't need to be particularly creative to make something that you would even consider buying in a shop. If you can spare a couple of hours while in Ubud, I would recommend this class. In fact I'd like to spend a future holiday just making jewellery all the time!"

Stumbled across this on Trip advisor.Looked like the perfect family activity whilst in Ubud with our two daughters aged 15 & 11.Must add that this was very last minute and I was worried that I would not be able to arrange it,but the quick response(e-mails) from Wayan made it all very easy and possible.We walked up from Ubud town centre and were expecting to find a shop but to our pleasant surprise you actually enter the beautiful family compound and the \"workshop\" is an open air set up of groups of 4 desks-all very professional.Wayan is the most amazingly friendly host, greeted us all with hugs and immediately offered us all refreshing drinks whilst we browsed the extensive range of photo catalogues of examples of what you can make.There was so much choice it took the 4 of us some time to decide but soon we were all \"designing\" our own pieces with the help of Wayan and his craftsmen.They transfer your finished design to your individual pieces of silver and you then cut,twist bend into shape with the perfect balance of letting you do it yourself and stepping in and helping a bit when needed.The whole process was fascinating,all the more so for the beautful relaxed setting.My design took me the best part of 2.5 hrs to complete whilst my eldest daughter was enjoying it so much she completed her piece and made two more in this time (even paid for the extra pieces with her own money-if you knew her you would you would know how much of a compliment this is!) When your piece is finished they \"weld\" it while you watch,using an amazing foot pump powered blow torch and then polish it up to a finish that I almost couldn't beleive when they placed it back down in front of me.WOW did I make that?Surely not, it looks ....just to proffesional! We were all so pleased with what we had made and we had such a good time doing it.I cannot reccomend this highly enough as an activity,as an experience,as a wonderful memory of Bali and the lovely people and as a unique (Literally!) Souveneir to be treasured forever.Thank you WayanWe will always remember our time with youPhilip,Estelle,Stephanie and Jennifer Walker"

We both made rings and were surprised by how well they turned out. It seems you can create almost anything you wish. It was very interesting to see how this silver jewellery is made. Besides all this we found it a very therapeutic way to spend a morning, in Wayan's, compound, under shelter and cooling fans. For the money we had a relaxing and enjoyable experience and an item of jewellery that would have cost us more to buy at home than the activity cost."

I knew I had to check this place out, because as well as wanting to try silversmithing for a long time now, my name is also Monique!Mum and I didn't have much idea of what we would be able to make in our class, but there are lots of folders with pictures of different designs to help you out with any creative block! Everyone has a very \"can do\" attitude, not matter the design you choose. I thought my choice may have been a little complicated but Wayan just smiled and said \"Great choice! It's not too hard, we will help you.\"And help is given every step of the way! You get to do the more basic and safer parts of creating your piece, while Wayan and his team do all the soldering and filing - it's a lot less stressful when you don't have to deal with a blowtorch and grinder! Everyone is very patient and helpful with the parts you try yourself.The workshop is in Wayan's home, which is really cool because you get to see inside a Balinese family compound. It's nice and cool, and they provide you with icy cold water. I want to say thank you to Wayan and his team, particularly Echo (sp?) for the great afternoon that Mum and I had at Chez Monique. I highly recommend them if you are looking to do something a little different to the usual sightseeing and want to get creative! They really do make everyone feel like they can make something very special and nothing compares to being handed your brand new piece of jewellery after it's final polishing and being able to say you made it yourself!I can't wait to come back with lots more design ideas next time I am in Ubud."

Wayan is the nicest, most caring person and his staff is so helpful and knowledgeable. My husband and I spent about three hours at his home making a ring and a bracelet for ourselves and they turned out AMAZING! We started out by looking through books of pieces that other people had created to get ideas, and ended up drawing our own. We were involved in every step of the process and everything was completely our choice. They do the dangerous welding, but I watched that being done the entire time, and we were able to polish our pieces on the wheel, ask questions, and do everything from the design to the cutting to the polishing process. Everything was go at your own pace and very laid back. You could be as involved as you wanted to and take as much time as you needed. My husbands ring was done in a little over two hours from start to finish, and mine was closer to three (I'm a bit too much of a perfectionist!)He warned us that we were using more silver than the class price allowed for, so we weren't shocked at the end. I made a very sturdy bracelet that cost 700.000 (about $65 USD and my husband made a ring for 500.000 ($45 or so USD) which included the cost of the silver as well as hours of entertainment and a new appreciation for silver jewelry. I usually end up buying myself a piece of jewelry as a souvenir anyway, so the fact that I got to actually make something, take some fun pictures, and personalize my souvenir was just perfect. You'll pay as much if not more just buying a piece of silver jewelry at any shop in Ubud, so why not make an experience out of it? I can't recommend this class enough!!"

Got free coffee and water (coffee was delicious according to my husband)Our girls chose rings from photos in a book, and they started the work, with the help our my husband and of course with help of the staff. They were so glad with the result!It took about 1,5 hours, I thought the whole workshop took longer, but it all depends on which items you want to make. Same for the price, it depends on how much silver you use, in our case it cost 800.000 inr. for both rings.We chatted with other guests, who also made beautiful things. Very nice morning, and later on we walked back along the street, had a drink at Jendela House, and had lunch at Dapur Bunda.Would recommend this workshop to everone!"

Throughout the process we received help when we needed it but also had the freedom to do as much as we could by ourselves. It was a really fun afternoon, as the only couple in the class we enjoyed one to one supervision. At the end of the class we had two beautiful and unique pieces of jewellery. We went to the shop to buy a chain for my pendant, Wayan then offered to fix the chain to the pendant and delivered the complete necklace to our out of town accommodation the next day.

I would have to say that the last 10 years I have been coming to Bali this would be one of my biggest highlights. When I return to Bali next year I will be returning to make myself something else. If you have the time I highly recommend this to do."

I am the most uncreative person on earth and it wouldn't normally be my type of thing but I went along because I knew how much he wanted to do it. Turns out I had an absolute magical time and it was by far one of the best things I have ever done, especially in Bali. The staff are so friendly and will help you as much or as little as you need them to. I wanted a pendant with the tree of life. They encouraged me to first attempt to draw a tree myself which was very bad... haha... but then they helped me to tweak it and make it look like an awesome tree. I loved cutting it out and working with the nice man who helped us put it all together. We walked away each with a stunning and unique piece of jewellery and I will make sure we go back and do this class every time we visit Bali. Thank you to everyone at Chez Monique for a fun and rewarding experience... highly recommended and incredible value for money!!!"

All the staff are beautiful and patient. I am not arty by a long shot, but they are very encouraging. I was truly amazed at the work that goes into even the simplest of jewelry. Last year I made a beautiful pendant for my daughter (people ask her where they can get one - sorry, it's a one off :) ). Cost includes all materials and one on one instruction. You do everything from choosing your design, cutting it out to the hard work of polishing. If you are not into making your own stuff, please take time to visit their shop in Ubud as I have watched them making their pieces - it is all hand made, therefore each would be unique.Chezmoniquejewelry.com"

Located in a quiet backstreet just away from the main hustle and bustle of Ubud, a visit to the silver studio is an ideal way to spend a few hours if you seek something a little different from the main tourist pulls of Ubud. The studio is very peaceful and all the team are very patient and happy to help you. Wayan was very kind and nobody hassles you into buying anything other than that which you are there to create (a pleasant change from the rest of Ubud). You can be as hands-on as you want, the team are there to guide (or to take over if you need them!). This was my first experience at doing something like this. I went on my own and felt very comfortable and was given as much or as little help as I needed. I definitely recommend this to anyone visiting the town, it actually has a very broad appeal as you do not have to be creatively gifted to take part. At the end of the visit I have a unique souvenir of my time in Ubud-which means more than something purchased and haggled over in a touristy shop."

We both chose pendants from the many photos available - designs to suit just about anyone's taste. Next step was to draw a template which was attached to the silver so what you draw is what you get. Can't draw? Don't panic, if it doesn't go well one of the guys will help so it looks like it should. We then were shown how to cut out the piece using a wire like blade - they started us off and only helped if we got stuck, broke a blade (and not just one!) or asked for assistance with the tricky bits. They did all of the soldering - they use foot pedal bellows to control the soldering flame, certainly beyond our expertise. We then filed and buffed with a very pleasing finished product.We were lucky to be the only 2 there at the start so got plenty of help but still felt we did as much as we were able - soldering and electric sanding really not ideal for total beginners. Wayan was lovely, took time to show some of his and his son's work.We were both really pleased with the finished items and would love to visit again given the chance.Probably the only criticism is cost was not mentioned until the end but we did not ask either - even so thought the whole experience and finished product (how many people can say they have a piece chosen and made by themselves?) was good value for money and would do it again"

I was very nervous to leave my ring or to have someone work on it that didn't really know what they were doing. Not only was Wayan incredibly knowledge, he was very sensitive to it being intensely sentimental. He fixed my ring in a few hours and went above and beyond what I was expecting by polishing the stone. My ring looks the most beautiful it's ever looked and the stone is securely locked in now.

First morning there was me and a few couples but we had all been scheduled with different start times so Wayan could get us started and ensure no bottleneck. Helped me fix my mistakes and took care of some of the tricky bits but I left with something I really felt I made. Loved it so much went back the next morning to make a second piece. Will recommend to friends and family. I'll make sure to visit again when next in Bali."

After a 1 hour taxi ride from Sanur to Ubud I sat down with Wayan (who is lovely) and really took my time choosing the best piece for me. Then it went downhill from there. The whole \u2018making\u2019 process only took about 20 minutes and it was done. I struggle to say that I made this piece because all I did was cut out the shape and later polish it, the rest I just watched being done for me. I sat there thinking that these parts must be the technical parts that they always do and soon ill get into it, and then my piece was finished! I chose quite a small piece because I wanted it to go on a bracelet that wasn\u2019t so big, but I really wish I had been able to make something else with the left over silver because I\u2019m sure there was quite a bit \u2013 I guess my fault for not asking.So all in all I don\u2019t think I got what I was expecting out of it \u2013 a very tiny piece that I don\u2019t feel like I can completely say \u2018I made\u2019."

NO ............... We spent a morning making an exquisite individualy designed (by us) 925 silver piece of jewellery. I went thinking this will be nice mother daughter time and we will come out with a cute lump of something resembling jewelry. Wrong! We arrived and were warmly welcomed and after consulting some photograph albums and a little googling we settled on our designs. I strongly suggest you arrive with your design ready to go to save time though as I will do next time. Although there was plenty of help and assistance we realy felt that we made our pendants ourselves, complete with name, date or inspirasional message engraved on the back. I can highly recommend this experience to all I can truly say it was the best experience of our holiday although we did also indulge in shopping and massage NO hair braiding :). Cost $40 but we used a little more silver so paid $50 very reasonable as we were there several hours and took home a high quality piece of art, if I may say so myself. Big thanks Chez Monique we will return."

It was a really wet day in Bali and this was a perfect activity to enjoy in the rain.We were greeted with hugs by our teacher Wayan Sunarta and seated at a table with some paper, pencils, and 3 display books filled of inspiration. I am not very artistic, so I chose a simple design - an infinity ring. Others taking the lesson chose more complicated things like earrings, bracelets, pendants etc. You can do anything you like and there is plenty of help if you need it!Wayan and his staff will help you shape your jewellery if you need it, however they let you do it instead of taking over (unless you really need them to, which I did at one point!). I chose to engrave my ring using my twin sister, and my own initials. The staff are very approachable and will go out of there way to ensure you are comfortable and enjoying your experience. This is a great activity for the young, and young at heart. I am 27 and would recommend this for children as well as adults of all ages. No matter your level of skill you will leave with a beautiful piece of jewellery that you designed and made. What a great souvenir.Thank you so much to everyone at Chez Monique!

So, while we didn't do the whole process ourselves, we did get to see it all being done and we ended up with products that are very nice and we will wear proudly!

I chose to make a bracelet with an elephant pendant on it. You sketch a template then cut it on a sheet of silver, so you're actually creating your own artwork, not from a stencil. I thought that was very cool! I am not an artist, so my elephant didn't come out perfectly, BUT there are many people there to help you out. Any mistake you can think of, they can fix it.

All of them turned out incredibly well. We were given lots of personal attention, and were so impressed with Wayan his staff. They were very welcoming and it was also a great experience to visit a Balinese home. We were there about 2 hours and we ended up spending around Rp 500,000 each as we used more silver, particularly in the bangle. Given we all got to take home a great personal hand made souvenir I think this was pretty good value. I would highly recommend this activity, it was unique and fantastic."

They did not do the polishing as the temperature was too high. It took us close to 2 hours to complete. The final products were beautiful and kids felt so proud. They wear their pendant all the time. Thanks so much for the wonderful experience Wayan and everyone there!"

I booked with Chez the day before and he stated that although he would not be there his colleagues would be - which was not a problem for me. The work shop is a 15 min walk from his shop near the soccer field in Ubud. Apparently Chez is the only locally owned silver smithing workshop in Ubud. Anyway I arrived very early as I really wasn't sure what I wanted to make as I have never done this kind of thing before and I wanted to look through the ideas books. As soon as I arrived I was given the books and I drew up some designs.. some of my own and some from the books. Then It was on to making!! On the first day I just cut out and engraved my designs but on the second day I was allowed to use the grinding and the polishing machine. I really loved the experience so much that I booked in for a second day. All up I made 3 sets of earrings and 5 pendants all of which I am very happy with. My friends and family have a unique gift that was handmade from me and I could not be happier with the result. I really did make a lot of jewelry and felt that the price was very very reasonable. When I come back to Bali I will definitely do this course again and I am already thinking of what I will make next time. Thank you to Chez, Moogy (a wonderful instructor) and Echo very talented artists!!"

I'm extremely happy with my piece and we can't wait to give our son the pendant my husband made for him. Our only criticism is that it was difficult for our driver to find, we came up from Umalas and out driver was not overly familiar with the area and we went past it because he was looking for the Chez Monique name, so maybe a more obvious sign?Thanks again, and we can't wait to come back!"

The class was not strict and all the students went at their rate (some fast, some slower) and it was fine with Wayan to walk around and assist all who needed his help. His assistants were also very present and would help \"fix\" our mistakes over and over again. I happen to have snapped my ring a few times and felt embarrassed by it, but Wayan smiled and said he will fix it without any problem. The entire experience was very pleasant and of course, the end result being able to walk away with a unique hand crafted jewelry is just cherry on top.

(In the end I did get to set a stone and take it home that same day.)There are so many designs to choose from I don't think anyone would have a problem in finding something to suit. I chose a lotus - possibly a little on the complex side for a beginner.I have to admit I felt super clumsy as I have never done anything like this before, and I broke quite a few blades while cutting out my design, but the guys are so friendly and helpful, they just sorted it out for me. Apart from anything else, it's fascinating watching the guys work and seeing how silver jewellery is made.I went with a group of others and our designs ranged in complexity, but all of us had a great time and have great souvenirs to take home with us. :-)"

This class is located in a traditional Bailanese home near central ubud which gives a very nice cultural feel. Wayan was our instructor and he is very friendly & patient. The class fee includes 10 gm of Silver from which a ring or a locket can be made. We decided to make love bands for each other and after hours of brainstroming we came out with an idea. Now the real challenge was to make the ring from the raw silver strip which seemed like a difficult task but Wayan and his team helped us along the way. When we saw the finished product we were not able to believe that we had made the ring ourselves. It is one of the best personalised gifts which we have given to each other.Highly recommended if you want to give a personlized gift/Souvenir to your loved ones!"

By doing this Sunarta, Moniq, and their team can give you the most attention possible .When you arrive they welcome you into their home with hugs and smiles and then sit down with a beverage to discuss your idea or look through the catalog for something else. Don't worry because you think your plan wont work, if you can explain it or even draw a somewhat likeness of what you have in mind they will make it work. Once planning is done you sit at your station with the raw material and get to work. We chose rings of our own design, Sunarta shows you the tools and how to use them, then its up to you. You can do as little or as much of the work as you are comfortable with but please try to do it yourself. Sunarta and the team are so helpful and patient you cant make a mistake. The cutting, filing, hammering all add up to a one of a kind piece that will last a lifetime.

The local team are as hands-on or hands-off as you want them to be, and will help with your design if needed, or suggest ideas if you are stuck!After redrawing our ideas in real size the silver was templates and we set about cutting, sawing, etching, bashing, filing, sanding and polishing our pieces.Sunarta and the team were happy to watch and offer assistance where needed, we never felt pushed to let them take over. However they would help with tricky bits if you asked. They even seemed happy enough when I snapped three saw blades cutting out my bit of silver!We were very pleased with our experience and the results, and would recommend the class highly.

The place is super and in a very lovely compound with the nicest people i met on the island. I made my own design based on ideas out of the book. I asked for something representative of Bali and was given some nice advice. i loved my time here and felt extremely comfortable. You are given the opportunity to either do the easy stuff and have the guys perfect it or, you can ask to be more involved. I think you do need to ask though as these guys are complete perfectionists and want you to leave extremely happy with your item of jewelry. It is however, a very difficult process and does require alot of help from the brilliant staff. The courses are very laid back and you get what you put in. Ask questions and they will answer and show, it is more of a relaxed unstructured few hours where you can do as little or as much as you like than a full blown course. I loved it and would highly recommend. The guy who owns it has an amazing story and he is local, it was important for me to support this as opposed to many foreigners whom have set up similar things in the area. Would highly recommend."

Next he starts cutting away one portion of the design then hands over to you, and not having done this before proceeded to brake 5 strings of the cutting saw, strings were replaced but was not given any help or guidance as to why you're breaking the string, what you're doing wrong etc.Anyway, after the cutting was finished, it was onto the other processes, where the staff kind of just took over tidied up mistakes and finished the piece (torching, cooling, buffing, etc.).

You will enjoy the experience, and bring home a momento that you could truly call one-of-a-kind."

It is worthwhile spending some time before thinking of what design you would like to make especially if it is for some one special before heading there... There are many pictures for reference and it is pretty nice. The artisans will guide you along and help with the final touches. Highly recommended."

The whole experience was so wonderful. Sunarta is a warm charming person adding to the great experience. I emailed Sunarta with designs for him to create which he did exactly as i wanted them. I can't thank Sunarta enough for my beautiful jewellery pieces. Sunarta allows you to participate as much or as little as you want in the jewellery making process. Entering his village was also a great experience. I would highly recommend this class to anyone looking for something special in Bali and can't wait to go back."

This was the best afternoon, we were there for about 3 1/2hrs. it's just him and an assistant so they work in small groups, but he was very busy, so it took awhile. We didn't mind, they were the nicest people! we got to pick through books of jewelry examples. but instead we designed our own. im not a good drawer, so know this if you want to have your own piece made, sketch it out and bring it with you (to scale) as they will use that drawing to make it. you truly cut, bend, file & form your own piece, it was awesome. Me and my husband got to make 2 beautiful one of a kind pieces that we will have to remember our honeymoon for a lifetime, it's the best souvenior there is! Great value! Don't miss it!"

We found this workshop on Trip Adivser after we saw others' recommendation, so we booked the class via email with Master Silversmith Wayan directly, very easy, we just need to confirm number of people and the preferred session time. On the day we arrived about 9:30am, we were only group of class in the morning, so we were very luck to have Wayan and other two silversmith to help us aside. We started from picking the product & jewellery desgin we want to make,coz too many pretty stuff could not decide which one to pick, so eventually end up with the decision of making a ring & a matching pendent. Both of them are easy ones as no cutting technique involved, so roughly took me around two hours to finish. The final products were better than my expectation after they helped me finish polishing, very pretty & I was so excited about being able to make my own jewellery. I m not after a fine jewellery with perfect bits & parts, as this is my first time in making jewellery like this, I was enjoying the expirence & having fun. This is a unique and great expirenice and one of my best part in my Bali trip this time, and I've made something special as the souvernier. I was very happy and definitely recommend!!"

I booked the Chez Monique class via email a couple of weeks prior to my trip, and was given a choice of three timeslots for the day, with each class taking about 1.5-2 hrs. Chez Monique silver studio is located about a kilometer up a gentle hill on Jalan Sriwedari, which is off the main road, not far from the Ubud market. (I got transport there, but as we approached Jalan Sriwedari, the driver suggested he drop me at the start of the road because it is too narrow to drive up. As it was raining, and I had no idea where I was going, I insisted. The road is fine for driving, so don't fall for this trick!). The class is situated in an undercover patio of the family compound of Sunarta, our welcoming and charming host. It was really nice to see how the locals live in a pleasant residential street. After a warm welcome, we were given time to browse the design books and sketch our intended piece. I drew a fairly simple medallion charm with a star design on one side and some stamped words on the other. We were a class of four, and we were taken to a workbench in turn, to start work. Depending on the complexity of your design, Sunarta and the other silversmith (whose name I didn't catch) provide different levels of assistance. For me, I cut out the design from the silver using a special hacksaw, and did the letter stamping, which didn't take long. But the welding, burnishing, finishing and polishing was done by the professionals! So there was a bit of waiting around, watching this all happen. But the reward for your patience is a lovely piece of jewellery to remember your trip to beautiful Ubud. Initially, Sunarta said that my design, with its double thickness would cost more than the standard 400k Rp fee. But in the end, he said it was a bit smaller than expected, so the standard fee would be enough. All in all, I would highly recommend a visit to Chez Monique for the class - it was very relaxing and rewarding."

I received a prompt reply from Sunarta the evening before and arrived at his compound with two others already there making their pieces (it only took me about 1.5 hours though if the class is full it can take longer). You are free to create whatever you please given the amount of metal allotted to you and there are books for ideas. Sunarta gives you the metal piece with your design outlined which you then cut with a saw and add any texture via hammering. It is okay if you break the saw string! I did it twice unfortunately. Once you have cut out your shape Sunarta's team will then sand, solder, put together the item and then polish. While it would have been great to have a hand in the finishing stages, I can understand that there is a liability should you do something to your hang or another part of your body as those machines work fast and have lots of heat! Nonetheless Sunarta and his team's humor, friendliness and guidance only enhanced the experience. Sunarta was so welcoming that you feel like you have been friends for a long time.

Very soon I had a length of silver in front of me and I was hammering and cutting along with the rest of our friends. There is a remarkable sense of satisfaction and achievement in creating something from scratch. Sunarta and his staff were always there to assist and advise but were very careful to let you do everything that you possibly could. When we were finished I had created a beautiful object that I was very proud of that I could give to my wife. All in all it was a great way to spend a few hours and very good value for money."

You have to go to the workshop first to make the jewellery (which is about 10 mins away by car). Afterwards, you have to make a trip to the shop to make the payment.

We had booked for 9:30 and 2 members of our party got lost and were 40 minute late, however, this was not a problem, as the class was relaxed and individual to each participant rather than a large group.There are lots of books for design ideas, however, I would do some research before hand so that you make exactly what you want. Also, I am not a very good drawer, and you sketch your own design. If you want something more perfect, print off your design before hand, the exact size of what you want.The owner was really friendly (we even got a hug!) it was lovely to chat with him, and interesting to find out that his business was never intentional, it started through an individual request for a lesson grew through word of mouth. My only semi-criticism would be that the assistants do quite a lot of the process, soldering and such. I made sure that I kept asking to be involved but you have to be forth moving with this if you want to be involved in the entire process. On the other hand... It ensured that the finished products were professional looking and fixes the wonky sawing and hammering that I had done!Over all, a great experience... I'm thinking of going back before we leave Ubud!"

Instead of working from preplaned designs and blanks, I was allowed, and helped, to create a unique necklace pendant using my own creativity, drawing and metal working skills. Their instruction and patience while I learned the rudiments of silversmithing was inspirational, and their attention to detail remarkable. Their studio is tucked away in one of the nicest of Ubud's neighborhoods and with other artists in the compound serves to set the stage for a truely creative experience. No matter your talent level they will have you leave with a professional looking memento of your visit to Ubud, Bali."

The atmosphere is flexible and open, not at all like a structured cooking class, which I liked. After being assisted with the two designs, I began to work on my two pieces of jewelry. I was provided help along the way, just when I needed it, and left to practice on my own the perfect amount of time. Sunarta is exceptionally patient and guided me through my projects. His assistants were equally patient and helpful. For two pieces I paid $80 american dollars. I would highly recommend this activity and the recipients of my gifts were extremely pleased to receive hand-made silver jewelry personally made just for them! Thanks for the great experience!

Some would say a simple mistake, however I adamantly pointed out the amount was wrong and she still continued and authorised the transaction despite my refusal to sign for the amount. This was at the beginning of April and now 2 months on, after submitting fraudulence claims against the company, they are still refusing to return the money, despite also taking the correct amount. So they have had their money plus 10x that. I'm starting to think its part of their plan- rip off tourists who won't be there to deal with it. Would not recommend this company!!"

Don't be concerned you are in a private home - you are, and this is one of the things that makes the entire experience so fabulous. One tip, if you haven't made jewellery before don't be over ambitious rather pick something you will love and be proud of and ask the jeweller before you start if it is easy, medium or hard. They will certainly provide advice if you ask for it."

There were only 5 of us there and the team at Chez Monique helped us make some beautiful jewellery which are fantastic mementoes of our time in Ubud. I feel proud every time I look at the pendant I made and the ring that was made for me is on my finger right now. This was a great way to learn more about Bali and a real delight. And no-one complained when I kept breaking the saw-blades! (Whoever described this as poor or terrible must have been in a very bad mood.)"

My partner and I have actually done silversmithing before but due to various excuses haven't had time/ space/ tools to do any in recent years, our trip to Ubud has been a time to reconnect with our creative selves and gain inspiration to continue work at home. The point of our visit here was to see what a studio was like in Bali, I had seen one years ago and marvelled at the beautiful things being created with just a few basic tools and one small bench. There goes two of our excuses right there! Within a short space of time I created a ring that I was extremely happy with. Yes you can flick through a book of existing designs, for those who had no art background while we were there seemed to find them very useful but it was not mandatory to choose from these. I went armed with my sketch book and made sure we left our class until the end of or holiday so that our piece of jewellery was reflective of our Ubud experience.My design was more complex than many others, combining several simple elements pieced together. With regard to not being able to solder the piece together ourselves, I was not phased or upset by this, I have done it before and with the equipment they use here I was happy not to play with fire this time! They use petrol and a bellows system! I had plenty of pieces to cut using a jewellery saw and actually learnt a new technique - the Balinese hold their saw the opposite way to how I was taught in perth at art school and it s actually easier. The fellow doing the polishing held the silver without gloves or safety equipment. Some people complained in their reviews that they didn't get to do these things themselves but I really wouldn't expect to jump onto those things too quickly in reality it takes more than one lesson to become proficient at silversmithing. It would be a fantastic introduction to the process and if you really enjoy it why not investigate a course at home. (However it would cost you a great deal more and in all likelihood you would end up with only one piece at the end of a several week course! ) I think it was an invaluable workshop with many of the people there with us gaining a new understanding and appreciation for the work artists do.We found Wayan to be so warm and welcoming. His studio was in the family compound so it was a lovely snippit of family life and how the real people live not just the inside of a hotel or restaurant.Would I recommend it absolutely, would I do it again definitely. As a lady with large fingers and particular tastes and a desire for the unique this was the perfect way for me to come home with a perfect piece of jeweller thar every time I wear it I will remember my trip fondly. There were a few couples there making rings for each other- sweet....especially the one who wrote \"beast\" in his ring his wife questioned him why he did that, he had meant to write \"best\" as in friend. We all had a good laugh. It was a lovely friendly atmosphere all round. As we arrived a family with a boy about 11 or 12 were just leaving. So this is something for couples, individuals ( Wayan is so lovely you wouldn't feel alone) and families."

Everything from the location \u2013 was amazing being welcomed into the family compound, Sunarta opening his home and his knowledge with us, to the expert guidance to help create a piece to be pleased and proud of. So many designs to choose from or the opportunity to design your own. From start to finish, Sunarta and his team\u2019s helpful guidance, steering me away from disaster a couple of times, to be able to take away a lovely pair of earrings for me that I will quite happily tell anyone who admires them that they were made by me\u2026and a little help perhaps, and a ring and pendant for mini me \u2013 who was very pleased with herself with the end product."

I've learned so much from the hands-on experience, and couldn't believe that the design from my imagination (point A) to the actual one of a kind silver ring that I'm wearing now (point B) was only a matter of just taking some time, a few hours of uninterrupted learning, that allows for unleashing the creativity within me. Surely this is both a productive and creative use of time in Bali. Browse through the catalog for inspiration, or better yet come up ready with what you would like to do beforehand. Wayan was very professional in giving suggestions to me, and other options to improve my design. I also appreciate that he discussed the total cost of the product even before I started making it. The workspaces are very organized and tools can be accessed easily. They offer water/drinks and make sure everyone is comfortable.Thanks so much for Wayan and his staff for a great experience!"

Wayan Sunarta speaks excellent English and is one of the most positive people I have ever met. He has at least six picture catalog books to help you choose your project - rings, pendants, etc. He and his jolly helpers then guide you through each step of the way until you project is completed and polished, regardless of how long it takes you.we spent about 4 hours making our intricate pieces, but others making simple rings completed much quicker. The workshop is held in his family compound, which is such a serene place to work. The advertised price includes the workshop and the first 10 grams of silver. My wife and I each made fairly heavy double layer pendants, yet in total the cost was very, very reasonably priced. Once completed, Sunata put our unique pieces on a leather band and then in a gift pouch. You can further make your piece unique by stamping whatever you like on the back. I strongly recommend singles, couples or even whole families, regardless of age do this workshop. And at the end, you have a unique self made keepsake or special present to take home with you as a momento."

You can choose to make anything from earrings, a pendant, anklet or belt buckle and they help you perfect it. prices charged by weight and time. We paid 950,000 rb for two big rings including a large bintang. Worth every penny. Would have paid hundreds of dollars in north America. A totally unique experience you can't pass on while in ubud.

As mentioned in other reviews, the class actually takes place in their home (not at their storefront.) It was great to actually be in their home and learn how to craft some pendants out of silver.We jumped right in and started just doing it. A bit daunting at first, but the man (not Wayan, who was at a village ogoh-ogoh meeting) helped guide us, despite the language barrier. I ended up breaking a few of the mini-hacksaw blades, which earned me a few laughs, but I finally got the hang of it and crafted something that I love and will get to enjoy as a souvenir for a long time.We finally did get to meet Wayan and loved chatting with him and Monique.This is a great activity and highly recommend it."

The class usually begins at 9:30am or 1pm.To be honest, I was not at all excited, and a little sceptical about spending the day making making jewellery but agreed to go along with the super keen girlfriend. However, that quickly changed when I saw how genuine the class is, with the welcoming and professional Sunarta.The class was great from the start to the end. I first chose to do a ring that was very plain and simple, but decided to try challenge myself and go for a trickier double layered ring with a tree in it. I made numerous mistakes but every time, the staff took it and melted some silver into the mistake and brought it back for a second attempt. They are all extremely patient. You don't feel rushed and they are ready to answer any questions you may have or give you tips.I would suggest that if you like a design, choose that one to make. Don't worry if it appears too tricky because the staff is ready to help and will show you how to do each step then get out of your way and let you do it.The rings turned out better than I thought possible, with a very professional finish.

At 400,000 Rp or just over \u20ac30 we had hoped for a bit more. There was no doubt the guys there were firendly, but we felt that the expereince was lacking. Upon arrival we were give some books to take a look at or asked to sketch what we wanted to make. We chose a pendant for my wife to make, and I chose to make her some earrings. The pendant involved a lot of cutting with a small saw, and we were told that they would charge us extra as we would surely break many blades....ok we thought, but at 50,000Rp, an amount charged without counting the blades we broke, we thought they could have bought a lot more of these blades than we used. After cutting out the holes, the guys there took it and soldered a ring onto it, cleaned it, and attached a necklace...exerience over for my wife. It was pretty much the same case for me only quicker. I was given some silver wire to make the earings although I had chosen to make some with a flatter profile (too difficult perhaps), and after 10 minutes of bending the wire to the shape I wanted, it was taken by the guys and filled with solder, not at all the look that I was wanting. As with my wife, it was then taken and cleaned, ear pieces attached and handed back. The finsihed items of jewelry look decent enough (only up to our skill I suppose), but we learnt and experienced very little that could not have been done at home. We were not intimately involved as some reviews suggested, more like peripherally involved and paying for the privelage."

With NO prior experience, but with a desire to do something creative in this artistic enclave, we booked and returned a few days later. Entering Wayan Sunarta's family compound, we passed the house of his uncle who was working on a detailled painting with one year of work already invested. Roosters crowed and laundry flapped, inscence burned and offerings littered the path as we passed the family temple before we arrived at Wayan\u2019s lovely home at the back. Greeted warmly with hugs and drinks, we were guided through ideas for creating a first piece of jewelry and then we set out with pencil and paper. Satisfied with our \u201ccreations\u201d, we were then guided with instruction and the odd held hand, until we had fashioned the crude pieces that were to become our \"masterpieces\" The polishing, a technique requiring thickly calloused hands since so much heat is produced from the friction, we relinquished to a teacher. Lastly, the welding required to attach rings, loops and pieces together, we again had watch since a first time class cannot begin to teach these skills. More polishing, and our 2 pieces were very proudly stowed away in bright organza bags... Two pieces of jewelry with meaning and memories."

But don't worry if you get stuck or break a saw blade (I did twice) Sunarta & his team are there to fix things / help you when requried.The only things you can't do is solder & polish your item. And fair enough too. These men are qualified in their craft & as an Amerture I was happy that is left to the professionals. You can certainly watch that process so you still feel part of the whole process. You do work outside but there is shade from a balcony & trees. You are also given plenty of water (sealed bottles). The workshop is on family compound & you'll enjoy the flowers, chickens, rosters & all the butterflies. It really was idyllic.

My wife and I read the reviews and being a bit sceptical booked in for an afternoon session that started at 11.30 and we didn't finish till well after 4! People come and go at their own pace (usually 2-3 hrs) but we had some tricky designs we wanted to attempt so I think we were by far the slowest. no matter to them though and we were provided with plenty of drinks and fruit if we needed. It pays to think of a rough design before you go but there is definitely plenty of ideas and designs to choose from if you haven't. Sunarto was very patient and being there for a long time gave appreciation to his professionalism at dealing with many different nationalities and somehow getting everyone to leave with a huge smile on their face. I saw so many saw blades being snapped multiple times by different people and each one was approached with a \"no problem, I fix for you\" attitude. Most of the rings we saw made sell in the chez monique shop for $25-$35 so if you think you are going there to buy silver at cost, use and often break his equipment for free then you are wrong. One girl while we were there was concerned that $40 was a lot of money for such a small ring, she reluctantly went ahead and within 30 minutes her attitude flipped around and she was so excited about what she made the money she paid for the experience was suddenly a bargain. We paid the $40 each and came away with a big ring, pendant and a matching charm for a bracelet. More than happy with the cost and the experience."

The owner was there a short time but then left.His two employees were really nice. BUT the class was basically choose a design and we'll do it for you. If you asked to do some of it they would let you. But basically it was watching them make it. There was no talk of the different methods you could use, history, background or anything.At the end my partner was charged extra, which was a complete con because there is no way his is over 10g. I think it might just be a standard way for him to make more money.For the money we paid we were very dissapointed. I don't normally write reviews but this attraction having no.1 spot is very deceiving."

However we were fortunate as one school bench was free so we took the class straight away. As we were beginners we decided to make some simple piece of jewellery. I made earings, and my wife made a nice ring. It was so fun making it from drawing the design till the final product. Have to mention that all time we had excellent support from Sunarto and his associates. All in all a great experience, a great memory of Bali and Ubud. When visiting Ubud or Bali in general this should be a must to visit as the experience and fun delivered through this class is priceless."

He does have display books of different designs but many of them are probably too complicated to duplicate. A simple design is best as you will have to draw your design onto paper to size before cutting your design with a small coping saw into the \"raw\" unpolished sterling silver metal. You will also file your piece before handing it over to Sunarto's assistants to grind and polish. The cutting and filing takes quite abit of effort so it is handy to know that at any time you can get assistance. They will also help you fix any mistakes you might make along the way. The finished product is a gleaming mirror like pendant or ring. You will be amazed that you were part of creating this piece of professional looking jewelry. You can also stamp your initials or something else onto the back of your piece to personalize it! Highly recommend this activity. Sunarto, his wife and his staff are wonderful. But be aware that if you are paying for this by credit card you will n\u00e9ed to go to his shop after. This is abit tricky to find and if you go on a hot day like when we were there - you might want to consider bringing cash so that you don't have to worry about this after all your hard work!"

I had a wonderful afternoon during which time I made two pieces, a ring and a necklace. I bought the design of the ring I wanted to make with me and everyone bent over backwards to help me, whilst still letting me do the work. Their guidance was really great and I now have two pieces of totally unique silver that I made. It is a wonderful experience and irreplaceable souvenir in one. They had plenty of books with ideas for those who didn't know what they wanted and they were so patient with all of us. There were two younger girls on the course, and they also excelled, it is suitable for absolutely everyone. I would highly recommend this to anyone travelling to Bali. I travelled from Kuta for the class, I had lunch in Ubud and walked around the shops. For those hoping to make a day of it I would suggest doing the monkey forest in Ubud in the morning, lunch in one of the many restaurants, walk around the shops and then head to the class for 2pm. It is all within around a 5 minute drive from central Ubud."

The class does not take place in the shop, but rather in the family compound a few streets away (so it also gives a bit of a glimpse into family life). It is walkable but depending on fitness/time it's probably worth getting a taxi up from the main street. We were shown various designs for silverwork and encouraged to design our own (for the creatives out there) or we could copy an existing design (still fun for those with somewhat less artistic talent). Friendly help was always on hand if we were'nt sure whether a design element would work or not. We broke several saw blades but they didn't seem worried. I'm sure it happens to everyone :) Because of some other reviews we were worried about being charged for additional silver, we made neck chain pendants that were roughly 5g each athough not weighed at the time. Something using more than 10g silver would be pretty big i.e. much larger than a ring or pendant."

I took my 13 year old daughter with me and we had such a great time, we went back a week later!Sunarta was the most warm hearted, beautiful soul. He welcomed us into his compound (family+ extended family housing lot) with open arms (literally!) and shared his world with us. He and his wife, Monik, were just wonderful. Monik makes the best ginger tea (Sorry Sunarta, your tea was not quite the same, as lovely as it was ;o) ) He is very well spoken and easy to understand. He guided us into what choices we could make or design our own. He and his 'mates' assisted us to cutting, sawing and stamping our own piece as we desired. Then his mates soldered ringlets etc and buffed and polished our piece until it looked like a professional had made it! I was blown away (as were others as I'd finished mine) with our creations.

Luckily they told me that so I actually got some silver handling experience! Everyone is so helpful and knowledgable about silver smithing (?) and very patient.I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with a creative side!"

Wayan and team are very supportive and very happy to guide and assist you. So you walk away with a beautiful piece of jewelry.A stunning experience. Unique."

The idea of the trip was to visit some spas and just relax, but we decided there was a limit to the number of beauty treatment you could have in a day, so booked a silver making class in Ubud as well. We had a great time. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming, and it was interesting to see the ideas the others came up with for their silver making project. We came home with some new found skills and a lovely keepsake of our Bali visit. Thanks Sunatra."

I'm really proud of my new ring!!Totally recommended, regardless of how crafty you are. There are designs for all levels and tastes, so I'm sure you'll find something you can do. In my opinion, the rings with carvings are the easiest :)This class costs 400.000 and you get 10g of silver. I've checked other places that cost 350.000, but there you only get 5g, so Chez Monique is clearly a better deal!"

It didn't matter though, since Sunarta has so many designs to choose from (there are several binders full of designs), that it takes a while to make up your mind as to what you want to do. I chose to make a lotus flower necklace and my sister a tree of life design necklace. The tree was extremely time-consuming, as there were intricate cut-outs that needed to be done. My lotus flower was not as difficult but I did have trouble in imprinting the silver and carving the shape. You really do everything on your own! Sunurta and his helper teach you in making your dream design, and assist whenever you mess up (which happened several times to me), and they complete the product so that your chosen product looks professional! You can also personalize the jewelry by stamping the back. Such a great way to personalize your visit to Ubud/Bali!"

It was nice just relaxing and the atmosphere wasn't rushed. Only potential downside is the lack of industrialisation - this makes the experience more authentic but much less time-efficient. The jewellers have pretty basic machinery that certainly wouldn't meet OH&S standards in most developed countries, but it definitely delivers. Price is also remarkably cheap."

It took about 2.5 hours and help was always on hand. Once you finish it (I needed quite a lot of help!) the staff polish it up and fire it etc and you watch while they transform it into a true work of art.

My friends and I spent Sunday afternoon at Chez Monique. Sunarta and Monique welcomed us into their home, giving us ideas to make our projects more achievable. I was able to work through every step of the way with assistance for parts that I couldn't do and watch the pendant come to life, adding my own touches. I am thrilled to bits with my family tree pendant and can't wait to show it off to friends and family when I get back to Sydney. I will DEFINITELY be back and will also recommend the class to others in the future. Many many thanks for a fabulous day."

I had a great time doing this class, the teacher knew that most people had heard of him through Trip Advisor and was definitely taking into account some of the feedback from some earlier negative reviews. Among the things that seemed to be addressed were:Class size: I went with three friends, and last minute another two friends wanted to join but we were told the class was full. I was worried there might be too many people to really get a good experience but when we showed up there were only two others, so six of us altogether. This really gave us a good chance to get time with the teacher and the other two helping him.Amount of help: Some reviewers felt like their entire piece was made for them, I didn't feel like this at all. I felt like they kept a good balance between showing me how to do it, letting me do it on my own, and helping me out if I got a bit stuck.Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and I'm so glad I came away with great memories and a pendant I will definitely be wearing often."

Working with handcrafted silver is a fascinating process and all the more so when done in the immaculate family compound of Wayan and Monique Sunarta. Wayan, the silversmith, is a charming gentleman who made us so welcome we felt like part of the family within the first 5 minutes. We soon found ourselves engrossed in turning our 10 gram beaten strips of 92.5% silver in beautiful pendants. In truth most of the work was done by Wayan and his team, but you can be as hands on as you wish and I discovered that Wayan is brilliant at patching up boo boos. We were delighted with the end results and my silver dragon pendant will always remind me of this fascinating and delightfully unpretentious morning in Ubud. Enormous to thanks to Wayan and Monique."

We both made pendants, and my friend stayed on to make another. I was so surprised at what I had created, with Frank's help (Sunatra that is).

When I arrived, Sunarta wasn't there and nobody knew what I was talking about. A woman told me that there was no class that afternoon, so she offered to call Sunarta and clear the matter. His attitude by the phone was OK and although we had to wait for him and his apprentice for about half an hour, it was worth it.The jewelry class was very interesting and now I have an even greater respect for jewelers: it's very very hard to craft jewelry!

Our piece turned out better than we could have imagined. If you are not into custom designing your own piece, they have plenty of books to look at for inspiration. Sunarta and his helper were so patient in navigating us through the processes. Their kind hearts puts us at ease, which made it easy. We have a new appreciation for handcrafted jewelry and the time & energy it takes to create beautiful pieces. One suggestion if you are considering taking the class, would be to go to their studio to see some of the pieces and designs that they sell. This way you can get an idea / inspiration for the piece you want to create. This was such a experience working together as a couple, putting our love into our special piece.

The boys had prepared a design for a silver ring which they explained to Mr Sunarta. For 2.5 hours they worked on their rings together with a silversmith assigned to them. I think that the rings are exquisite and the boys are very pleased, proudly wearing them. They really enjoyed the experience and the company of Mr Sunarta and his team.

He was always very kind and accommodating. In our group there were two other ladies. Both lovely. We stayed in the center of Ubud and decided to walk. In retrospect, we only gave ourselves 1/2 hour stroll but should have took more time as there is so much to see.The classes are held at the back of their family compound (he has many creative people in his family - painters etc). The compound holds all his family houses and a temple. It is amazing and a cultural experience in itself. When we arrived we entered the gates and followed the path to the back, a kind and very creative elderly gentleman who was painting the most AMAZING painting pointed us in the direction about half way down. Sunarta knew who I was instantly and was very warm. His english is amazing. My partner and I decided to make rings for each other. The tree ring with 6 branches, 1 branch for each kid (yes we have no TV). We really wanted our rings to mean something and Sunarta recommend that we make it together and then cut the ring down the middle so it was made from the same piece of silver. Was such a wonderful idea. Thank you Sunarta. Sunarta had 2 other men their helping us out. We paid approximately $135 AU for the 2, 4 hour classes, 3 men helping and all the extra silver purchases (we have big fingers and made heavy rings) and two tickets to the Fire Dance show. I can not tell you how much of a fantastic experience this was. All I can say to you is to go and do it. We are definitely going back.

There were only two other students present and two teachers. It is useful to already havesome kind of design in mind when you go for the class as your drawing will serve as the template for the silver cutting. There were however also plenty of examples/photos on hand. We were made to feel very welcome in this family compound, a glimpse of dialy Balinese life, which was an added bonus. Obviously our daughter needed some help with the more intricate parts.. She enjoyed the class very much."

            "review": "A great afternoon out!. A friend and I found the Chez Monique Silver Smith Class on Trip Advisor and thought it was a \"different\" thing to do while in Ubud. We had a great time, and came away with something which looked really nice as a momento of our time.The class is run in a traditional family compound not far from the main street. It can be a little difficult to find however a sign has been posted out the front.The two guys running the class do so in a relaxed and casual manner. There isn't really \"school room\" feel about it, or set start and finish time, they just take groups on as they can and move between them. When they have more people, naturally, they are spread a bit thinner, but if you're fortunate enough to be there with only a couple of others it's great. There were probably about 8 including us when we first arrived, but only the two of us in the end.They start by showing you some books of pendants, earrings and rings so you can get an idea about what you want to make. My advice is to be realistic in your decision! Next they get you to sketch your design on some paper and they transfer this to the \"raw\" silver. If they think your design will need additional silver or work, you will be advised and given the opportunity to make alterations.Next you are on the tools cutting, filing and stamping your masterpiece, and let me tell you, at this point you think it looks pretty ordinary! The good news is that for novices like us, most mistakes can be fixed by the guys!For obvious reasons they aren't too keen on letting novices loose on blow-torches and grinders and let's be realistic here, by doing this for you they're turning your piece into something that you may actually wear. They are happy for you to watch over their shoulders, ask questions and take photos as they work on the final stages and to be honest we were happy for them to do that. In the end we were blown away by how good our pieces looked and it was a fun afternoon for only 400.000 rupiah (approx $40 AUD/USD)."

Chez Monique's silver smith class was a great way to spend a couple of hours set on the outskirts of Ubud. After picking us up from the centre of Ubud we were taken to his compound and shown around his home. He talked to us about daily life in Bali, how they lived and answered any questions we had about Balinese life more generally. As an anthropology student our host was very welcoming and helpful with answering all my questions! We looked through some brochures and decided on the rings we wanted to make and were warned in advance that because they were more complex designs, they would cost slightly more. After confirming this was fine, we each drew out the designs and set to work cutting them out of silver. We were able to participate with as much or as little as we wanted. Whilst my mum had a go at everything, I chose to sit back during the finishing stages to make sure I had a top quality finish on my ring! We were lucky because we were the only ones in his class that morning so we had lots of attention. We were very pleased with our finished rings as they are such a great souvenir to help to remind us of the real Bali, behind closed doors! The class was 2.5 hours in total and the rings ended up costing 500,000 each (\u00a333.70). Completely worth it for the detailed instructions, the friendly and warm welcome and a glimpse into the everyday life of the Balinese.Thank you Mr Sunarta for kindly welcoming us into your home and helping us to make beautiful pieces to remind us of Bali. Truly worth a visit."

Long story short, besides the two of us there were nine other customers so the two employees were barely able to help us. We wanted to make plain, simple rings and all they would let us do was the engraving part. They wouldn't let us even cut the strips of metal and definitely said we couldn't help with soldering or polishing. Really? I thought this was a class!! It took us about thirty minutes to do the engraving then we had to sit and wait 2 1/2 hours before they could get to us for the soldering. Then, they ended up telling us to just come back that night to pick up our finished rings. Good thing we had a motorbike or we would have had to get a taxi because this place definitely isn't within walking distance! Then, when we came to pick up our rings, they charged us 450,000 rupiahs ($48 usd) for one of the rings (it's supposed to be 400,000) because the owner said that it was over ten grams. This was extra frustrating because before we started, we specifically asked if our rings were under the ten gram limit and the same man that overcharged us assured us that there'd be no extra fees. THEN, later we weighed the ring and IT WEIGHS FOUR GRAMS!!!!!!!!! Ahhhhh!!!!!!!! The next stop of our trip was in Yogyakarta, Java where we ended up seeing another silver class. We tried again and ended up having SO much fun! It was just us and one teacher. We were shown how to do all of the carving/cutting/sawing, soldering, and polishing ourselves - it's so much more special that way AND it only cost 120,000 rupiah (vs Chez Monique's 450,000)."

There were 7 of us doing the workshop and we all went at our own pace. My piece was less complicated so I was finished within 2 hours. Workshops don't seem to be daily and the place is a little tricky to find so I would suggest getting your hotel to call ahead to book and get directions. Once you arrive at the family compound walk right to the back and down the stairs. Only negative - most people's pieces seemed to cost more than Rp 400,000 so I would recommend checking the price of the design before proceeding. Hopefully this isn't an indication of greediness that has the potential to ruin this business. Recommended if looking for an activity while in town."

This helped get the creative juices flowing allowing us to sketch some ideas on to paper. Once we'd chosen what to produce, the sketch was placed on to sheet silver and, following a demonstration, we cut out our designs. After which they were polished and finished up to a high quality pendant. Other options involved stamping, oxidisation and a number of other skills depending on what you decide to make.It was a great experience with some lovely jewellery to take home as a momento.Be aware that the price of the item will depend somewhat on the amount of silver you use! Sunarta is very upfront about this from the off based on your design, but take some extra cash in case you decide to make something heavier or larger than the included 10grams. The time is also dependent on the complexity of what you make! 2 hrs is fine for something simple, but more complex things will take longer unless you're a wizz at it!"

Sunarta, Monique and his assistant were so patient, helpful and kind while waiting for us to decide on what we wanted to make. Even for someone who is artistically challenged, the experience was memorable and we ended up with 2 beautiful and unique pieces of silver (some help is definitely required especially when it comes to the polishing part) as a memory of our wonderful holiday in Ubud! Definitely a must for those who do not mind spending a bit of money to experience something unique."

We had a little trouble finding Sunarta's home but this was more to do with our map reading than anything else. He is very helpful and found us and brought us to his family home. I believe he often picks up people from his shop to attend the class. Sunarta was very warm and welcoming and it was a real pleasure to spend time with him and talk about family. The class was very interesting and Andrew and I made rings to remember our time spend in Ubud. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this activity, maybe ensure you have a good map and directions or get Sunarta to pick you up."

In the morning, it was just the 2 of us and Sunarta, Monique, and Harris were all so kind and helpful while we decided what to make. I enjoyed it so much that I stayed for the afternoon and made 2 more pieces of silver work! Their home is beautiful and Monique told us about Balinese culture and about the offerings she made while we were there. In the afternoon, there were many other students but I still felt that I got the attention that I needed. When I wear my silver jewellery, I just remember the lovely day that I spent in Ubud making it and the warmth and kindness of my teachers. I also met Sunarta's sister (I think), who also has a shop in Ubud and returned to her shop to buy some beautiful earrings. If I get the chance to return to Ubud, I would love to return and take another class. Oh, depending on the weight of your pieces, there may be an additional cost for the silver. Since I spent the whole day there, the afternoon fee was less than my morning."

When we heard about this class, we decided it would be a great way to learn something new and by master jewelry makers. Sunarta and his family are absolute sweethearts and so welcoming to their home. Sunarta even picked us up from the Chez Monique Shop which was located nearer our hotel and drove us to his home/studio a few minutes to the north of Ubud. You can design pretty much anything you want and Sunarta and his team will help you to create the design. I sketched my mom's signature and we made it into a pendant for a necklace. Absolutely gorgeous and they helped me every step. To be fair, they do a lot of the technical work, but I got to see the process and learned a lot.Great way to spend a morning or afternoon in Ubud!"

It was great fun and educational in that I learned how cuts outs were make (by hand - not moulded) in metal jewelry. The instructor and his assistant were very helpful, friendly, patient, and took a lot of time to ensure that each of us (4) produced a piece we would be proud to wear. It's really neat to have a hand made pendant that is a reminder of the exotic island of Bali. I found the class so interesting that I've started searching for one at home that will allow me to make earrings to go with the pendant.If you are looking for something a little unusual to do in Bali, give it a try. I would advise coming with a design - keep it simple and small. Cut outs take a lot of time!"

I have had the pleasure of taking classes at Chez Monique and have never experienced any problems reaching him by phone; as a small businessman I'm sure he relies on phone calls from potential clients/students and would therefore not want to miss any potential business. I have found that the easiest way to communicate and book classes with him is directly on the Internet. I believe he checks his mail twice daily and his response is usually within 24 hours. Classes are held in Wayan and Monique's home where you not only experience their gracious hospitality but also get a glimps into the daily life of a Balinese family. Since classes are held in their home there is no signage but any taxi driver would be able to take you directly to the house. Classes are held at the back of the compound so don't be shy about entering. I look forward to taking another class with Wayan on my next visit to Bali."

They have really done something special with this place.Wayan, his wife Monique and the rest of their team made welcomed us into their home with warmth to see how their silver-smithing is done behind-the-scenes. Wayan and Ari were attentive throughout, giving you as much direction and inspiration as needed. It was an insightful experience and a different way to spend the afternoon in Ubud.The course costs 400,000 baht (around 28 GBP) and lasts approximately three hours in total. This also includes 10 grams of sterling silver to make into whatever jewellery piece you wish to make. The only thing I would have wanted a little more of, was to be more hands on with the joining of parts and polishing of the piece. Having said that, when I asked to tumble/polish the silver ring I'd made - Wayan was more than helpful. We were there for three hours, so realistically it would take at least a day for us to learn all we needed for the soldering aspects of this course. In three hours, we covered designing the piece, cutting the design in sterling silver and adding any embellishments/stamping as necessary.This course is for anyone who wants to see how silver jewellery is soldered/melted and formed together. The nice added bonus (a fairly big bonus), is that you get to walk away with your new work of art! Note: You don't have to be particularly creative or artistic to do this, as there's plenty of help from the team."

He then bent the silver and welded it together before sanding and polishing it to the desired finish. In the end it was great fun and a worthwhile experience."

I never realised what amount of intricate work it takes to make jewellery. Sunarta was very patient and a very good teacher as was his helper. Sunarta picked us up from central Ubud and dropped us off again where we requested. The class went for a few hours and we were offered tea and coffee. After we designed our jewellery pieces and were helped greatly to achieve this I get to go home with a memento to keep forever of my trip to Ubud and the Chez Monique Silver Smith Class.Check out the Chez Monique Jewellery Shop.

The class takes place in the family compound, and you are given information about the layout and design of the compound. You are encouraged to seek your own design, but also helped along if you struggle with the actual drawing part.I would strongly suggest that you come with a design in mind. Coming up with the idea and drawing it took by far the most time of the experience. After your design is complete, you craft your piece (with assistance as necessary from the craftsmen). I will disagree with a previous reviewer. Everyone in our group made a pendant, and there was no \"weighing\" of the pieces when we were done. We were charged exactly what Sunarta said we would be charged. There was no pressure to buy anything else or upsize the pieces in any way. I went with my 12 year old daughter and she enjoyed it every bit as much as I did. Highly recommended."

I read about this class on trip advisor and saw that it had great reviews and really liked the idea of owning a piece of jewellery that I had made myself however, I had no idea how nice the ring I designed would turn out. I drew a design at home before I went Bali and when I showed it to Sunarta, who by the way, is one of the most friendliest people I have ever met, he said \"no problem, easy\", with a massive smile on his face. The class itself was great fun, and Sunarta and his helper were very accommodating and friendly and nothing was too much trouble, even after snapping a cutting wire for the third time!!!! The end result was amazing, something I would buy in a shop and I am so proud of the fact that I designed and made it myself (with some help of course) But this class was well worth the 400brp I paid for it and now I have a beautiful butterfly ring to show for it too. Sunarta picked me up from my hotel at no extra cost even though my hotel was quite a way out fo town and he dropped me off afterwards, chatting and smiling all the way. I would recommend this class to anyone, its a great way to get a bit of balinese culture as Sunarta's workshop is within his family compound, its very interesting learning how jewellery is made, plus the coffee he serves is pretty damn good too."

Wayan was willing to let me hang out and observe him making other jewelry pieces while we chatted but I didn't want to hold him back.Instead he took me on a short tour of the surrounding countryside talking about what was going on in the community before he dropped me offI thought the price of 400,000 rp was reasonable considering the price of silver which has skyrocketed.over the past few years.I doubt anyone could get a personally designed jewelry piece weighing 10 grams for the equivalent of $44 from any jeweler which was the cost of the classThank you Wayan for allowing me this opportunity to see what you do and learn about the complex series of steps needed to make a custom jewelry pieceI thoroughly enjoyed my time there and your infectious smile!"

We had a friendly greeting and a few pictures of jewellery to help us think of a design and were told to draw what we wanted and the exact size. The man made recommendations on ring sizes and what silver pieces to use to make our design. The brochure said we would have '10g of silver included in the price for your creation enough to make a ring or a pendant' and that 'additional stone or silver may be purchased in class'. As we have never worked with silver before we had no idea how much 10g of silver was and so presumed from the wording in the brochure, the thick example rings and his recommendations that 10g was enough to make our design as there was no mention of the need to purchase any extra silver. We started making our designs, cutting silver, filing it, engraving the inner band and watching the soldering. One thing we were a bit disappointed in was that we weren't explained the process unless we asked about it. All was fine until it came to the finished product. He put my partners ring on the weighing scales and it came to 19g, 9g over the allowance. At \u00a31.40/gram we were a bit shocked we had to pay an extra \u00a312.60 when we believed we were inside the allowance. I felt like we had been tricked into using more silver than we thought. I thought we had a set amount to use and if our design was too big then he would \"honestly\" inform us that 10g would not be enough and what the extra price per gram was. We did not mind paying the extra \u00a312.60, it wasn't the cost, it was more the way he went about it. He argued his case by saying it is \"impossible\" to tell how much the jewellery will weigh until the end. An experienced silversmith, who has tourists in everyday making similar pieces, most definitely knows roughly what size and design is possible without going over the included 10g! Any tourist could go to town drawing a design and think it is within the 10g but expects the professionalism and experience of the silversmith to guide them otherwise. He also tried claiming my toe ring was 1-2 grams more that it was aswell, even when the scales were obviously off balance. We had some lovely jewellery at the end of it but just becareful not to make a ring over 1cm wide and watch him as he weighs it. Flat pendants should be within the 10g inclusion."

It really is easier than expected, you get a lot of help and it's very relaxing.Highly recommend the class. We went to his shop afterwards to buy a necklace to go with the pendant.

Our family--two adults and two teens with no prior silversmithing experience--spent a lovely, satisfying afternoon in the shady courtyard of Master silversmith Wayan Sunarta creating our own pieces of silver jewellery. We were welcomed warmly, offered drinks, and waited while Wayan finished with previous clients. With very little introduction and even less guidance, we set to work making rings (husband and daughter) and pendants (son and self). Wayan and his assistant were always ready to help with technical questions and show us how to accomplish our ideas. It was very very laid back; the atmosphere was relaxed and the time flew by despite the heat and some of the frustration of working in a totally new medium. We were all really happy with our pieces--I am still wearing the hammered silver ring my husband made me. One criticism is that we were made to wait a long time, despite coming on time. That time could have been well used if Wayan had set us up with paper and pencil and some parameters for thinking about our projects. Having never worked with silver we had no ideas where to begin. It would have been helpful to know some of the techniques and tools available. Such as the tiny block letter chisels that allows one to hammer words into the silver. It was only after I was almost done that we learned about them. A photo book of some ideas and designs would have been helpful as well. I would suggest coming with some ideas or sketches as there is no guidance given around what to make. We all enjoyed the afternoon very much and would certainly return."

Our designs, though simple, turned into a magnificent piece of jewerly that will be worn all the time. Just to see and be a part of the process of forging jewerly in a completely unique environment was truely amazing. I would highly recommend Sunarta and his family of silversmiths to anyone looking for an experience that they can bring home with them and wear as a daily reminder of their trip.On a side note be sure to visit Sunarta's shop which is located a few minutes away from his home, where you will be constructing your masterpiece. Despite what the name indicates it is one of the few local owned and operated businesses in the area. This means that all of the profits stay in the local community not abroad. The shop has been in the same format and place for around 15years, I think and still manages to stand out in quality and atmosphere. Go on keep it local and try your hand a something totally unique.

Best to come with a good drawing to speed up the process...thenthey stick your design to the silver, you cut it out using a tiny saw( oops, I broke 3), then silver snips, then you file through the inside and outside of your design.Then you're up to soldiering on the loop for a chain/earing setting, then the polishing begins.Sunarta called my first design a 'practice' and allowed me to start from scratch again...and with his help my piece turned out exremely well,This activity is for all...my partner also made me a pendant.We recieved hugs from Sunarta and his wife (Monique) when we left, and a nice follow up email the next day.The price is totally worth it and although you may think it sounds high....compare it to having a meal(which at the end you have nothing to show).A must do in Ubud as well as the Bali Eco downhill 25km bike ride."

From the moment Monique picks you up, to the moment he hugs you goodbye you feel you are in the company of a new friend. On arrival you are carefully explained the process, and supported at every step. No mater what your ability the team will get the best out of you. You are able to use all the tools, with help at any tricky stages - leaving with really personal high quality pieces and a great feeling of satisfaction. While there are pictures for inspiration i would recommend taking some ideas, or images of pieces you might like to copy as this will really help get the most out of the process - they will tell you which are best attempted. We had a wonderful day and highly recommend! there may be other classes emerging, but none are as charming, friendly, or run by a local and his lovely family. Enjoy"

Sunarta is eager to share his Balinese culture and language.The best thing about the class is the freedom. You are not confined to making any one type of jewellery or one design. What you want to make is up to you. So if you have any clue about jewellery, then I would say it\u2019s best to have a design sketched before you go. Don\u2019t be alarmed though, Sunarta is happy to give you as much design time as you like. He is very patient!"

We spent really nice 4 hours in this course that we'll never forget:First, you get to enter a local Balinese home, or what's called \"compound\". You get to see how a large family lives together in one small zone and how things are arranged.Second, you get to do whatever you want with 20 grams of silver, which is a good value.Third, you are taught everything from cutting to soldering, which is very interesting for people who're into handcrafts in generalHaving limited time, forces you to work in the most simple and basic methods ever, and you're forced to do a simple design and can't go very far with your imagination. What's really admirable is that the tools they use in Ubud are the most basic tools we saw in any handcrafting ever. And this makes you appreciate the amount of effort these guys make to produce something complicated when in your home country technology have made things million times easier. Make sure you have a design in mind before you go to speed things up.Certainly a recommended course for anyone and everyone, try and you wont regret it."

We showed Sunarta our photos taken from the internet of the type of designs we would like to make, a ring (for him) and a pair of earrings (for her). Sunarta smiled and said no problem and we then spent the next couple of hours cutting, stamping, smoothing, hammering until we (and they) were satisfied with our handiwork. We each had our own teacher (his helper a patient and observant young man) who not only showed us what to do and encouraged us, but helped finish off to give the items that professional look (come on a couple of hours won't make you an expert silversmith!). We wore our jewellery with pride as we walked back to the centre of Ubud, a leisurely ten minute walk. For a couple of first timers we very impressed and vowed to do this again when we return to Ubud.Take your camera and capture the stages and the final outcome. A very, very pleasing experience which we highly recommend. Diane and Andrew"

When travelling recently in Bali with friends to celebrate a big birthday milestone one of the experiences we wanted on our trip while in Ubud was to make a piece of silver jewelry to mark the occasion. Although we hadn't booked we dropped into Sunarta's lovely home where he holds his classes to ask if he could fit us in the next day - which he very obligingly did even though he already had bookings.Sunarta, his co-worker and his wife were all very welcoming and hospitable. He gave us advice on the best pieces to make, guided us through the process, stepped in at the difficult points and had us out the door in time for lunch (which was a short stroll around the corner to the main street of Ubud).We've let Sunarta know he needs to get up with house no. quickly on his compound so it's easier to find the place, and that we couldn't find a phone no. on his website - otherwise I couldn't fault this class."

Upon arrival I was introduced to his other workers and asked if I would like tea, coffee or water to drink. Although it was warm out, we worked on a large veranda and were not in the sun. I had bought a jewelry catalog with me from the states which was a big help to show Wayan what I was thinking about making and the difficulty that would be involved. I might add Wayan speaks excellent english and was very easy to understand. I decided on a silver ring. Making this was nothing like I expected. The process was quite extensive. We started with a flat piece of silver which I hammered (see photo) to get a texture on my band. We soldered, sanded, and used different chemicals (which the master silversmiths did for me) to come up with my beautiful finished product.The total time spent was about 2-1/2 hours but I knew pretty much what I wanted.This is a class I will take again upon my return trip to Bali and I highly recommend it.

It is not signposted so ask mr Sunarta for directions or he's happy to pick you up from Nomads restaurant! If you have some ideas about what you want to make and a design, bring a drawing, picture or something. If you dont have that, that 's fine too! Together we designed a simple, but stylish ring (well most of that was his idea, as I had no cour:-)).Together with his friend they explained, showed and told me about the process, and of course I was encouraged to have a go myself! It is quite difficult, but once you get the hang of it...I had a great time, learned something new and have a lovely souvenir to take home.So......highly recommended!"

My fiance and I love art so we had decided to join some art courses before we visited Ubud (as Ubud is famous of different kinds of art). We walked around Ubud downtown and found this silver jewelry shop (www.chezmoniquejewelry.com) The owner, Wayan Sunarta, is a super nice guy. Other than offering silver smith class, he also led us to look for wooden carving shops as we want to buy high quality wooden carving door / window. Without him, we couldn't know where they are and how to negotiate in local language. About the silver smith class, we arrived at Wayan's shop to choose the silver jewelry we want to make and ask for his advice. Since we're only beginners, we'd better make some simple jewelry. We finally decided to make a ring and a gecko brooch / pendant. It's a very interesting process and so different from the feeling that you just buy the jewelry from a shop! For the gecko brooch / pendant, we first cut the shape of a gecko from a piece of paper. According to this paper, we cut out the same shape of gecko from a silver sheet. Then bang the pattern by a thick needle on the silver sheet. Finally stick the hook and brooch pin at the back of gecko silver sheet. It sounds simple but it needs quite a lot of patience and details. The process of melting the silver hook and brooch pin to stick on the gecko back sounds easy but it's actually very difficult so control the instrument. For the ring, it's made from several pieces so we firstly needed to cut the silver sticks into several parts. Sticking them together by the flaming instrument. Then cut out two leaf shape of silver sheet, smoothen the edges and stuck them on the ring. The final process of any silver jewelry is to polish them until shiny by a polishing instrument. Again, it looks easy but you have to hold the jewelry really tight. After polishing them, the jewelry looks so different and beautiful!!! It's a memorable experience and cannot compare with just buying jewelry from shops since you don't know the making process. These two pieces of jewelry become so precious to us and very good souvenir for Bali!!!"
