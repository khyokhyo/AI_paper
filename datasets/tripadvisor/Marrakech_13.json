An amazing collection of photographs from the past 100 years or so record Morrocan life in a high quality range of photographs. The short video currently being shown from the 1950's of a visit into the Berber villages also provides an amazing cultural experience."

A large collection of stunning photographs from the 19th and 20th centuries set over three floors, with a rare 1958 film following Berber tribes. There is also a cafe on the roof.We had some trouble finding this museum as it is well hidden in the Medina and locals keep removing the signs as they would rather make money by taking people there. Be warned, you will be approached by people offering to take you, but they will demand payment. We only paid 20dh, but we were quite close by then anyway. Our \"guide\" was not impressed, however. If you have a smart phone app - use it. It's cheaper and less confrontational."

We didn't really struggle to find it but as with many places in Marrakech, some patience is needed to find where you are going. Entrance is 20dh per person. We spent our time looking through three floors of historical photos of Morocco - particularly on Marrakech and Tangier - and really enjoyed what we saw. Information is in English too. It's a quiet place and serene spot in this city. It might not be for everyone but we very much enjoyed looking at the portraits and photographs and watched a short documentary upstairs on the Berber people. We finished off with a drink on the roof terrace which has fantastic views of Marrakech! Would recommend to lovers of art and photography - it gives you some great inspiration for photos of your own!"

Which considering the relative small size of the museum (and other attractions) is relatively expensive. However the staff are friendly and knowledgable. They give a introduction to the photographs. The museum has a central courtyard and pictures in the rooms around (much like a riad). There are three floors. In one room there is a documentary about a French photographer who visited a mountain range, I think it was in the 1950s. The rest of the pictures are very good, but there really is not that many. As I noted, the space is not bigger then a riad. I do love photography but to call it a 'museum' I would expect more about the history of photography there. This is meant as constructive criticism. The space felt more like an good exhibition. Perhaps moving to a larger space would work better? However the cafe on the top floor is excellent. Staff are great, food is super and very reasonable. It's good to chill out there on a hot afternoon. Actually it made the visit. Without a cafe I don't think I would have enjoyed it. But does that make visiting the museum worthwhile? That's up to you."

Visited September 2016 as a couple.We had mistakenly visited a museum nearby while trying to find the photography museum, but after finding the place (with a little help from the previous museum attendants) we were very glad to have visited! Once you pay the cheap entrance fee, you walk through long draping curtains into a courtyard area, and walk towards the stairs where your visit begins.The collection of photography in this museum is fantastic, and it is truly fascinating to see pictures of old times. With each collection is a brief about the photographer and how they came to take the photos or how they become synonymous with Moroccan photography.There was a video (15-20 minutes long) about a French mans journey (I can't remember his name) through the Moroccan mountains, and of course a few of his photos. There are some open books which describe the coloured photography techniques used in taking some pictures, and then a 'dark' room to see some examples.Truly, the pictures are wonderful and well taken. Seeing past photos of the Koutoubia Mosque to what we saw was moving.Visit this museum!"

The trek (and by trek I mean leisurely walk) from the old town through the Souks was a nice way to begin a day out, and despite some opportunist sellers and helpful cries of, \"It's closed, come and see Tanneries...\", the Museum was an oasis of calm and tranquility. The exhibitions are diligently curated and the quality of the prints are second to none. There really is a history of the Berber villages and the development of both the city and people of Morocco. Each level was filled with two to three photographers pieces, with plenty of guidance in English as to what was on display. Capping off the visit is a shaded rooftop terrace overlooking the city and Atlas Mountains. Plus, it also has a toilet that doesn't require you to dig out a couple of Dirham to the tip the attendee. Thumbs up chaps!"

This museum is near to my Riad so just up an alley way so to speak,I must say before even looking at the Photographs ,the staff here are so nice and kind .The building has a nice feel about it and calming environment .Some of the Photography goes back to the 1880's and are amazing to gaze into the past ,looking more like works of Art which they are!It was so hot the day I walked in and really wanted a cold drink ( 107 degree's)That I went to the roof terrace first and had a lovely cold mint and lemon drink ,they even let me keep the fan on tables .The man serving was one of the nicest people I have ever met!The entrance ticket can be used again ,which is good as I felt too hot to concentrate on the interesting photographs and a film from 1957 also.Please visit this place."

In addition to the remarkably good photography itself, there is a very nice little restaurant (we had only a lovely cold drink on a very hot day) and an excellent loo. Very much recommended"

I heard quite a bit of raving about the Ben Youssef Madrasa from other ladies attending the yoga retreat I was on, but for me it was the Photography Museum that resonated far more.The photography is good, but what makes it so interesting is what it captures. You can see what the Souks used to look like, there's a lot about tribal culture (whereas nowadays you don't see much skin show on the streets of Marrakech, in the museum there are photos of tribal women with their shoulders uncovered), there's a portrait of a slave (I didn't realize slavery was part of Marrakech history). All of that made this really interesting for me.It also has a lovely-looking cafe with a great view at the top. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to sit down in it, but I definitely will if I have another opportunity to visit Marrakech."

It cost about $4 to get in and the ticket can be used over again on another day. The museum is located around a center courtyard and is, unfortunately, not air conditioned so on a hot day it is not as much fun.It also has a clean restroom with a sink and plenty of toilet paper--a nice find.The building is three stories high with a cafe up a spiral staircase to the top floor. There is seating in the shade, but again since it is outdoors whatever weather there is outside it is the same inside the seating area. They have a modest selection of Moroccan tagines, salads, etc. and Moroccan tea and other beverages. The waiter has to climb up and down that spiral staircase to the kitchen for every order.Up in the cafe you can see over the low, red rooftops of medina and if you are there at the right time you can hear the calls to prayer reverberate around the city.The challenge in visiting the museum is getting through the maze of the medina and avoiding the constant shouts from the locals that you are going the wrong way, or the street is forbidden, or the museum is closed when you are actually on the right street and the museum is opened. (Also, be careful not to be run over by motor scooters--avoiding them is a constant concern.) In many cases they tried to mislead us in order to show us the right way for a price. One man hounded us all the way to the museum asking for money which we finally gave him just so he would leave us alone.When we came out the museum we turned the wrong way and found even more harassment when we tried to get back to our hotel. Fortunately a taxi driver saved us and kindly got us back to where we wanted to be. I recommend a guide from your hotel unless you are traveling in a large group--single travelers or older couples seem to attract more unwanted attention than those who are in groups or people who are younger and stronger."

Both, the extreme goed quality of the pictures self, they all look like they where taken yesterday, with the best camera's you can find; but mostly because every picture tells an amazing story. This place is one of the best things Marrakesh has to offer a tourist."

It's quaint and a nice courtyard but the photographs whilst good are not particularly the reason to go that I expected, that said, there were some good photos.As in my title, the best part was taking the fresh air on the roof where the view over the old town is very nice. Combined this visit with the Ben Youssef Madras nearby and it's worthwhile."

Housed in a beautifully restored building in the medina of Marrakech, is La Maison de Photographie, which exhibits a permanent collection of beautiful black and white, sepia and hand coloured photos of Morocco from the 1870 to 1960. Framed and hung from the walls, or in display cases, the atmosphere is cool and relaxed as you wander from room to room. Take that extra time, when you reach to top floor, to sit and watch documentaries filmed during expeditions to remote villages. If you are interested in a visual history of old Morocco, the museum is definitely worth a visit.I was a little surprised at the price of the entry fee of 40dh, however your ticket can be reused for a return visit which I thought a great idea. Located within the entry you can browse through a small selection of postcards and prints from the photographic display, as well as a number of books."

The gallery photos are impressive, giving you historical lessons visually, captivating and beautifully presented. Film on second floor about Gerhard Muller is in French and English (subtitles) and one more on the third floor (only in French). The building itself is nicely decorated, in a clean, art deco sort of way, merging with the Marokkan flair. The rooftop restaurant is a must, food is delicious and generous (3 course meal including an amazing mint lemonade for only a 100 dirham). View is fabulous as well as the service. One of our most restful and chilled meals during our 8 day visit to Marrakech."

There is an excellent film shown as well and the walls are covered in some superb photographs of people and places. Sepia and black and white which look amazing on the white walls.

It's north of Jemma el Fna on the edge of the souks and is so peaceful in the madhouse that is Marrakech. The photographs of old Morocco are stunning and they have a wonderful film taken in 1957 just after independence. The film crew spent a couple of weeks travelling around the Berber areas and Atlas Mountains with a Caid and captured life as it was then, including the local dancers, for the first time ever.Definitely go if you can.This then led us on to the Musee Douiria de Moussaine, a town house that is being restored. This two was fabulous and so peaceful. It is again just north of the main square, but ask for directions at the Maison de Photographie - there is a little signpost in the souk if you are looking for it."

We ordered mint tea and sat and watched the sun go down, with cameras at the ready.

We came here to see some history of Morocco in pictures and the museum didn't let us down.It is not huge, don't expect too much, but there are photos of different international photographers in exhibition on three floors and on top there is a terrace with a small caf\u00e9 (no high prices) and a great view over Marrakesh. The pictures are really interesting and give you an insight on what the city looked like in the last 200 years before many tourists came here. We really liked it!"

In the heart of the Medina, the Maison de la Photographie is a great place to take a break from the wild streets and learn more about the history of the city. Inside, the building is very modern, clean, and well organised. There's three floors of different photographs, ranging from the 1800s to the mid 1900s. Inside, you see images that capture the faces of citizens, local gathering places (the mosques, souks, the main roads, etc) attractions, and simply the decor around the city. Each image has a brief explanation and credit to the photographer. There's also assorted sheets of paper that talk more in depth about given subjects related to the images. (in various languages) My favourite part was seeing the old cameras that were used to capture these images, and seeing the progression in detail and quality as time went on. (I'm hoping to study photography and media in the fall at university, so this was a great experience for me.) I have nothing negative to say about the museum, I just wish that it was a bit larger. After ascending the stairs and viewing all of the levels of the museum, there's a small cafe on the rooftop where you can enjoy a glass of mint tea, and take in the captivating views of Marrakech. I believe it costs 40DH (roughly 4 Euros) to enter, but it's definitely worth it."

The top floor gives way to a caf\u00e9 style restaurant - which unfortunately we couldn't eat at as it was completely full - and we could see why - the food looked lovely! Nice way to spend 1/2hr - 1hr away from the crowds and see the history through the eyes of the people of Marrakech"

Be careful of 'helpful' individuals telling you it's closed and trying to take you elsewhere - I advise the use of Maps on a Smartphone! Cost me 40dhs for entry and to return another day if wished.

This photography museum may look small at first, but it needs at least two hours to go through as almost every photograph cries out for a closer look. Most pictures are from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century, and introduce us to a period when the French colonisers were only just moving in and influencing the people and culture. The pre-colonial Morocco is thus very much on display. What is interesting is that where some pictures show much has changed since then, others show how little has changed. There is a nice little terrace on the roof where a light lunch can be ordered. Among the top 3 attractions of Marrakech."

Once inside the maison, a different feel from the rest of other architectures in the medina. Enjoy the vintage photos showing old Morocco. Particularly like its terrace cafe with good view, where good tajine to be served. Not expensive menu. Personally I like this place, good to spend two or three hours."

Roof terrace at the top serves drinks, snacks etc.Toilet on the ground floor Again v reasonably priced for Marrakech.You can buy many of the prints in the Maison in the shop on the ground floor.

I have to say that I was quite sceptical when my wife suggested visiting this location.The scepticism was exacerbated when we struggled to find it in the maze of alleyways in which it is located.This is not helped by the fact that local youth apparently remove or switch directional signs in the medina in order to 'guide' unwitting tourist their their own 'premises'.This practice is very frustrating and annoying and you should be very wary of accepting an 'assistance' from such people as if you do you are unlikely to ever find your intended destination. (if in doubt ask the shop keepers themselves, not the kids on the street).The Museum itself is relatively small being effective a converted family house with a very pleasant, well lit courtyard which is lined with amazing black and white photographs going back several generations.The photographs are well presented in a loosely chronological order and provide an interesting insight into the peoples of this area going back almost 100 years ago.Copies of most of these photographs available to purchase at reasonable prices and whilst we were there we had the benefit of the owner providing us with a great deal of back ground into some of these photographs which was most informative.I would recommend visiting this place, especially if you are a keen photographer and you have the patience and fortitude to locate it despite the 'assistance' of the local youth."

Maybe the reason is that Marrakech do not have any good museum, so people gives the higher ranks for relatively good museums. After my visit in Marrakech, I understand that it is a city that you have to spend more time in streets and with people, not in a museum. Anyway, I went to this museum also because of its high rate in Tripadvisor. It has a small collection which you can see in an hour. The entrance fee is 40mrd, a little bit expensive for Morocco. However the building itself is interesting to see. The terrace do not have any special scenery, you can find the same view from a terrace of another houses in Marrakech."

For me, the rooftop terrasse was the most wonderful part of the museum. This is because of the impeccable view over marrakech, a very relaxed atmosphere. Moreover, I can highly recommend to ask the museum for trips, we booked a trip with the french owner to a berber village outskirts marrakech. Not touristic at all, we got a personal guide, taxi from / to the berber village & a wonderful meal from an old lady in the village. The guide Khalid gave us a tour for around 3 hours (not for people in a weaker phisical condition). costs: 30 euros a person including taxi. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDABLE TRIP!"

Not the kind of place you'd expect to find a first-rate photography museum. So, I was naturally rather surprised by how engaging I found the Maison de la Photographie. Marrakech is already a rather exotic city with plenty of history and its fair share of mystique. Looking back at the city across the decades through striking images of its former residents and visitors adds a new dimension of satisfying complexity to your visit. Indeed it is the images of people, rather than places, that are most captivating. It's worth your time to visit and when you are done don't miss the rooftop cafe where you'll be treating to a rare view over the rooftops of Marrakech with the stunning Atlas mountains as a backdrop."

It's easy spend 2-3 hours here because they also have a small terrace cafe serving teas, coffee and Moroccan sweets and we've heard the director is friendly and encourages interaction.Look out for the photo of the young Moroccan \"hussy\" with her legs sprawled, obviously enjoying the attention of the male (client?) seated next to her.

I'm an amateur photographer and an anthropologist, so I loved seeing all these historic photographs and videos of the different cultures, cities, and landscapes of Morocco. The building itself, a former family home, is also beautiful, as is the rooftop terrace cafe, which has great views. I purchased a print here of the Marrakech square and it's my favorite souvenir...I would've happily purchased more if I'd had the money and could've taken them all back on the plane home."

The photographs on exhibit capture a Morocco of the past, of newly explored lands, interesting characters and a nomadic culture that is struggling to remain current. From a photographer's point of you, it shows how photography has changed over the years, not only the equipment and processing, but the subjects as well. Historians will love the scenes captured from as far back as the 1870s. Architects will love the traditional building itself. Everyone will love the view from the roof.Entry costs 40Dh and is worth it not only for the incredible photography, but also the view from the rooftop caf\u00e9. Sit back with a mint tea and take in all of Marrakech as it surrounds you with all its colours, sounds and smells."

Suggest you have a look around then come here so that you can compare how things have changed in the city since about 1880. Lots of different exhibitions, well curated with English translations available. Some really memorable black and white pics, regularly changed to showcase the whole collection over time. Friendly staff and some unique exhibits. Especially loved the Berber documentary from the 1950s, I stayed on after the credits to watch it again and got a different film! Think there are 3 x 20 mins in total taking you on a different walk each time, and showing different tribes' dress and customs. We didn't have time to do a full day trip out to the Berber area and this really helped to fill in some gaps. Fascinating. Cafe ok but very limited menu."

The 3 course menu is fixed with a choice of 2 salads for starter, bread, our main was tagine of lemon chicken ( no rice or couscous) & a delicious maison yogurt for dessert. The problem is the tiny 12\" stools at little tables barely 20\" high & the painfully slow service, it took the best part of 2 hours from ordering to leaving & that was with me taking my own dishes back to kitchen & a queue of waiting customers. We left quite stressed as we had things to do as I'm sure most tourists do.I would recommend a late morning drink to take in the view before you back starts aching. The Hibiscus tea is a tasty & refreshing alternative to mint tea."

Don't allow any itinerant businessman to steer you away from its path, encouraging you to look at Berber leathers, stay the course and enjoy the amazing photos, spanning generations and every hue of Moroccan from the early days of photography. The traditional tiled and white-walled courtyard and galleries provide a perfectly sympathetic backdrop for the works. You can also take in some videography, which gives background for the exhibition and the is a rooftop caf\u00e9, with wifi, that parallels the 360 city views from the top of Caf\u00e9 de France. Sa\u00efd and Muhammad were knowledgeable and super-personable curators. Well worth the visit.

A great little cafe which is so good it is unfortunately crippled by its popularity that can leave you waiting a long time to get any service or food.The waiter is apologetic but it can be a little bit frustrating, with such a small menu, they just need a second waiter.Worth the visit and highly recommended."

We had a delicious lunch in the roof top cafe ( aubergine salad and Moroccan salad.) There are several artisanal type shops on the same street worth browsing - a metal lantern shop where they made the lanterns in the back shop, a leather shop and a store selling traditional woven cotton and linen scarves. If you continue down the lane (turn right out the door of the museum) you will eventually come to a small local market selling fruit, bunches of lavender and a good selection of dates.

The rooftop terrace was fab, and it was where we caught the first glimpse of the high level atlas! The whole place feels calm and intimate, I would recommend it."

This is my second visit as i find it to be a calming spot to escape the manic mayhem in the alleys of the souks and surroundings.There is a small fee to enter the museum - worth paying as the photographs are beautiful and informative. This time the main purpose of visiting was for lunch. There was a fixed menu and quite a wait for tables. However, my friend and I asked for small adjustments to the meal, which were delivered and the chicken tagine with preserved lemons was very tasty. You can get a large panoramic view of the city from this terrace and it is shaded in many parts, should you need to escape the heat. I feel it is reliably satisfying and will always pay a visit when in the city."

I can't therefore comment on the food but the entire experience felt like a tourist trap. The photos were interesting but there were really too many people there to enjoy it. I would avoid it unless you are really into historic photographs, and maybe go first thing in the morning. This place seems to have become too popular for its own good."

Although a keen photographer I have generally found photography museums far too pretentious and tiresome..... this was different. The staff were incredibly friendly and polite. The museum is housed in a typical Riad.Some of the photographs on display were truly haunting - some photo's taken in the Souqs in 1912 (?) were so evocative, the age and techniques used helping to the historic feel of the images.As well as the actual photographs the museum is worth visiting for the roof cafe - nice views across to the Atlas mountains, nice snacks and food.All in all a very pleasant hour or so spent here....."

Set over three floors of a restored riad amongst the crumbling fondouks of the medina, surrounding yourself with the black and white (and some coloured) images here provides a pleasant escape from the noisy medina outside. The photographs transport you back to the life, traditions, scenes and ambiance of times when these photographs were taken - 19th century some them! Explanations of the exhibits and life stories of the featured photographers are in English. Definitely gives you a glimpse of how Morocco has changed (and hasn't changed) in the last century or more.For 40 dhm entry fee it's excellent value. The terrace is a must visit too to see the medina and souk from the rooftops. It also has a small menu to relax and refresh with. Wifi available but didn't work for me.I combined this gallery with the walk through the souk/medina to Ali Ben Youssef Madrasa. I found it easily enough by following the advice of my local friend. Which was: Go to Jamaa el Fna (main square), find the lane that enters the souk directly opposite Cafe de France, follow this lane (by following the pedestrian traffic) inside the souk (largely undercover) all the way to the end - where you'll find the open air. Once in the open air take a left - this path/road will pass the Marrakech Museum (Muzee) and then the Madrasa (if in doubt ask the locals for these landmarks). After the madrasa entry follow the path right and follow this through the medina. Keep left from there - there are a couple of signs pointing the way. Follow the pedestrian traffic if in doubt!"

Lovely and cool and clean inside, with knowledgeable, welcoming staff and a surprisingly nice little caf\u00e9 up top. Tricky to find, but have fortitude - it's well worth the trek through the maze of the medina to get there :-)"

It is a fascinating insight into Morocco more than 100 years ago and also surprising to see how little the medina in Marrakesh has changed in that time."

It has some of the loveliest exhibits I've seen in a long time. The property is charming in it's own right with a super little tea room on the roof with some of the best views in Marrakech. The young men that man the desk downstairs are obviously photographers themselves and speak excellent english. Upstairs are early (1950's) reels of film of the Berbers in their amazing desert cities. Watch them, it's worth it. Really interesting. Take time and go."

I didn't attempt to make it out to the Maison de la Photographie until my fifth visit, and it should be said that it's very difficult to find on foot. There is a little signage as you get closer but it's rather misleading. The place itself was great compensation, though. The photographs were beautiful and fascinating, giving an excellent sense of the history of the city and region. The building is cool, clean and peaceful, offering a very pleasant and quite unique gallery experience. Then, the famous roof terrace. The view and setting are stunning, perfect for a break and a bit of people-watching, and prices are reasonable. However, we came in the early afternoon and it was very difficult to find anyone to take an order from us or to pay - service did seem rather disorganised and not particularly friendly. It should also be said that whilst still not expensive to a European traveller, even one travelling on a shoestring, entry to the Maison de la Photographie cost more than visiting all of the other local sights put together."

I went there for lunch 2 days in a row because I was in disbelief something could be that flavorful. I'm not kidding. I marched into the little kitchen, uninvited I might add, to try and figure out how they made it because I was involuntarily groaning while eating it. I went to get it the next day to make sure I hadn't just been caught up in the moment and it was even better the second time I got it. I cannot overstate how f@#king good this dish is.

The price of admission was steep for what was displayed. There were few photographs in the collection that really held my attention for longer than five or ten seconds, which made our visit quite short, probably shorter than half an hour. It is true that the view of the city from the rooftop cafe is quite lovely, though the cafe, unfortunately, is as overpriced as the museum is.

Museum was well designed in an old riad with lots of natural light. Photos were a lovely collection of history. We marveled at how so little has changed since 1800s when many were taken. Still veiled women, donkey carts, men in tunics and slippers selling tagine pots. Young men at front desk were knowledgeable and helpful. Highly recommended"

If you are lucky the curator will give you a private tour. It is a haven of peace and calm away, but not far, from the soucks and the bustle of the surrounding streets. From the rooftop caf\u00e9, there is a 360 \u00ba view of the Medina."

There is a roof terrace on the third floor with a beautiful view of the city, and very reasonable prices - only ~50MAD for a pizza and ~90 MAD for a set menu (three courses) the day we went, but I get the impression this changes every day. The museum was also great, with a lovely collection of photos and good detail in French (though only occasional English translations available of the detailed placards) with both English and French labels on all photos.A word of caution - while walking there from the Marrakech museum my boyfriend and I were hassled numerous times. This is the same route to the tanneries and a lot of boys wanted to give us a tour there or tried to tell us we were going the wrong way. We were not and thankfully didn't listen to them. Trust your map or GPS and ignore those trying to help. It really is a simple path on the same road as the Marrakech museum (just maybe 5 minutes further including the sharp right at the corner past the Ben Youssef)."

I am surprised by some of the reviews here that seem dismissive of the size of the museum, and even a couple that say things along the lines of \"it's ok if you like old photos\". It's a museum of Moroccan photography! It displays historical photographs!The building is a renovated riad, not a purpose-built museum so it is not huge, but for the size of the building there are a lot of photographs, well- displayed on all three floors. The majority are stunning black and white images captured during the early part of the twentieth century, with some as recent as the 1940s. There are panels that give general information about some of the photographers in both English and French and each photograph has a title and date, which leaves the viewer free to observe and interpret the image (because it is an art exhibition!).The top floor has a little roof terrace with stunning views across to the Atlas Mountains and the kitchen (not a formal cafe) serves great coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice and a 'dish of the day' - we had the chicken tagine and an Aubergine salad, which was excellent. Pricing for the food is very inexpensive.Not a good option for anyone with limited mobility dur to the stairs.There is a shop on the ground floor where you can purchase prints and postcards of some of the photographs in the exhibition and they will post overseas for you. A great little place, and no more tricky to locate than anywhere else in the Medina."

The photos really tell the story of the people of this fascinating country and considering how old the photos are (1880's to 1940's) you can see how little had changed. There is a sweet little roof top cafe serving the usual 3-course tagine meal of the day and pizza and it was yum. ?4 entrance fee each, don't know how but we spent 3 hours in the musem including lunch and it was a very enjoyable break from the wandering and shopping. Note: would be good if they put signposts on both walls at the beginning of the street and not just one, so look up and at both sides when trying to find it."

Photos were nice, but the best part for me was the rooftop terrace and the lunch they serve. The terrace looks out over the city and had a lovely breeze. They offer drinks and also a set lunch for about 80 dirhams - the tagine was the best we had in marrakech. Also you can return to the terrace any other day as long as you keep your ticket stub."

If you know your photographic history, then perhaps you would get more out of this, but for us there was nothing especially captivating. The staff are certainly helpful and if you suffered the walk through the tanneries, it's a very welcome escape. Our visit was marred by a hellish morning trying to find the place which took 3 hours even with a taxi so it made it hard to apreciate what we were loking at. I would say that to get the most out of the exhibition you need to find the start of the story and try and follow it through, otherwise it's not very cohesive if you just wander. The prints dont seem to be of great quality either, with just a few exceptions, even taking age of the originals in to consideration. It's good value though at 40dh per person - a bit less than 4 euro, and the terrace is a little higher than most so gives a better view - though still mainly of satellite dishes and rooftops full of junk. Prints, start from around 250dh, for 20x30cm - the larger images are much more impressive if you choose carefully, but obviously much more expensive. Post cards are better value at 5dh, though as we later found - they are not exclusive and can be purchased cheaper elsewhere. Food is average for marrakech, but reasonably priced though dont expect much choice, there was a selection of 2 when we went.I dont want to be too hard, as overall it was a nice visit I think which would have been better had it been easier to get to, just dont expect too much."

After visiting the tanneries, itself being a unique if not smelly experience, we came across this museum of beautiful examples of early photography of Marrakech and Morocco. It is worth the fee to see these prints(most of the originals however are kept in France. To me it was very important to read the information posted on the walls as they gave a great insight into the history of the images. Also interesting to see the quality difference between the changes in photographic media. One image even has a reflection of the camera used to take the image(see if you can find it).After have a cool drink or snack on the rooftop terrace."

Receiving an introduction of the museum by him, we wandered about its beautiful interiors, admiring the interesting old photographs that revealed the historical and cultural aspects of Morocco of a time past. The view from the rooftop terrace was gorgeous as well, offering an unobstructed view of the medina. I'd definitely recommend anyone heading to Marrakesh to give this lovely museum a visit!"

However at least half of the images are recent prints off of the original glass negatives - nothing wrong with that per se - can see some amazing details - but lacks the patina and also a chance to see how the photographer brought out the original image (development and printing is more an art than a science). I would recommend to buy the ticket that allows you to visit 2 other museums nearby. For all 3 museums I would allow 2 hours, for this venue itself probably 40 minutes. The cafe on the terrace offers nice views but is about twice the price of similar venues. The print copies they sell in the lobby are very well done and an excellent value."

Photos in the gallery are very interesting, only issue is that the room that held the video would be to have this translated into English...

It features a remarkable collection of photos, and film documentaries, on Marrakech and other Moroccan cities as well as rural areas such as the Atlas Mountains. Dating from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, the pictures are truly evocative. One look at them and you'll see there's a lot about modern Marrakech that remains unchanged from a century ago. The gallery has a rooftop cafe terrace with great views of the city and prints of the photos can be purchased."

It's only a few Dirhams to get in, and the photography is fantastic! It's a great look back at the history of the city (not that Marrakech in the photos from the 1800s looks much different to how it does today!) But the best part is the cafe on the top floor. We had lunch on the balcony, 90dhms (about \u00a39) for 3 courses, consisting of a salad, an incredible chicken tagine and a strawberry-topped yoghurt (the menu presumably changes, but i'm sure you can be guaranteed a tagine). Eating with that view of the Atlas mountains (on a good day) is a delight. Take advantage of the view from that balcony to get some photos of your own."

The roof top caf\u00e9, provides what looked like good, cheap food and drink.

We recently spent a few hours here and thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it - extremely informative about Morocco and has the most wonderful photographs. The two young guys who seemed to be managing it were really nice and helpful - a pleasure to chat with. We went on to the terrace to order tea and something to eat but no one came to serve us which surprised us. The lack of street names on the streets in the Medina is a very real problem, it makes having a map completely pointless and means you will get lost which in turn makes you a target for young men trying to guide you and hustle you for money. This is obviously so common place that it makes you think the Authorities are content with this practice which is a real shame as it, in my view, reflects very poorly on Moroccan people and culture and does a real dis service as the people are mainly kind and helpful. Come on Government, it does not take much effort to get street signs in place!!"

Here you can wallow in the 'exotic' past of which more than a flavour persists in Marrakech: photos of sun-barred, robed and turbaned Berbers in the souks; of men leading queues of camels across Saharan sands; of a staring boy, backed by the Red City's red walls and a frieze of snow-covered Atlas peaks beyond; of musicians, crowds, interiors, atmospheres. Great photographers such as Muller and Belin are well represented, and you can watch Daniel Chicault's poetic film of life in high-Atlas Berber villages, which is helpful in illuminating aspects of the culture now. Nip up to the cafe on the top for a splendid view, the flitting of house buntings and a meal or a drink. Your ticket can be reused: a great excuse for returning, to add more layers of history to your visit."

A lot of the photos are nice enough, but it's all pretty sterile with slightly blurry photos all round the walls everywhere. Some are, of course, amazing given their age and location but, really, the 3rd best attraction in Marrakech?! I wonder whether it's more the contrast of the endless hassling in the surrounding streets compared to calm serenity in the museum and the nice cafe on top with the fantastic view of Marrakech? The entrance price is now 40 dirhams rather than 30 as was mentioned. I guess the plus side is that we were told we could use our tickets and come back another day and also that kids under 12 were freeIf old, blurry photos are your thing then this is for you. I can't imagine this museum being other than marginal interest in any other city anywhere else to be honest though"

He captured the true appearance of the people in their time. The pained or joyful eyes, the somber landscapes, the urgency and drama of the cloud filled skies. These are indescribable in truth. Upstairs is a small film showing which is excellent and on the top floor is a sweet spot to see Marrakech and to take a break with food and beverage."

From beginning to end, we were made to feel that we were traveling with friends who really cared about us and wanted to make sure that we enjoyed every moment. Our trip was planned for us with great detail to ensure that we were able to go from Marrakesh through the Atlas Mountains to the Desert and back by Said. We were priviledged to have Addi as our Driver/guide. he was very professional and did everything to ensure that we were happy from the get-go. Although Mother Nature \u00a0challenged us on the first day with every type of of weather from snow, hail and a lot of rain, we both felt safe with Addi driving. And He gave us so much historical information about the Berbers and their way of life and was eagar to answer all of our questions. He also did his best to teach us some Berber words which he must have repeated a thousand times. By the end of the trip, we had learned and laughed so much and we were excited that we were on our way through the mountains to the desert with Addi. We enjoyed every minute - especially our Camel ride that included an overnight stay in the desert at a camp. Addi also helped by taking pictures for us to make sure we had plenty of memories to take home to Australia. We met other travelers at camp who also enjoyed the Berber Music entertainment given by our Berber hosts making us feel more at home. I want to thank everyone at Morocco Countryside Tours for making our Moroccan experience one of the best trips ever! I want to thank Said for his expertise in planning the perfect tour and Addi for getting us everywhere safe and sound and making us feel like we were longtime friends as soon as we sat in the SUV by entertaining us, laughing with us and making sure that we were comfortable and happy throughout this trip. Most important, as two women traveling alone in a foreign country, we never feared for our safety which is the most important aspect of any trip. If you are looking for a great and authentic experience in this wonderful country, then Morocco Countryside Tours is the only way to go."

The friendly and courteous staff offered us information about the museum in English as we entered, and pointed out that we could come and go if we kept our tickets.A lot of loving detective work appears to have gone on to draw this collection of mainly very early photographs together, and they're a fascinating record of what has and hasn't changed in Moroccan life.A looped video on one of the upper floors shows colour footage shot in a Berber village in 1957 and although the commentary is in French it's pretty easy to grasp what is being shown. It was an interesting reference point when we got to visit a contemporary Berber village a few days later.The museum building itself is a traditional house around an open central courtyard, which keeps it cool and makes it a pleasant place to stroll around. The roof terrace, (supposed to be the highest in Marrakech), has a cafe offering tea and food. The service was glacially slow and we gave up on getting refreshments in the end, but the view out across the city was fantastic and worth the price of admission in itself (40dh).We wanted to come back to look at more of the collection, and spend more time on the roof but there were too many other things to do in Marrakech. We'd definitely go back next time."

The history was interesting and you were able to compare parts of Morocco with how they look today"

The place itself is beautiful and has a really nice terrace with a great view of Marrakech. You can even see the mountains in the background while enjoying a mint tea. The guy working at the museum was really nice and gave us an introduction. It's like a little oasis in an otherwise crazy city."

Yet, once you enter its the most beautiful little museum ever! The riad stunningly presents the most beautiful first photographs of Morocco, captured by a French man, who traveled from the Loire Valley to North Africa on his bicycle. All the photos have captions in Arabic, French and English, so you can understand the context. The first colour footage of Morocco is absolutely fascinating, even though I couldn't understand the French commentator! Also, I definitely recommend the gorgeous hibiscus tea on the terrace afterwards! The terrace has one of the most stunning views of the whole of the medina."

The price to get in to this exhibition (which can be hard to find so study a map and don't listen to the locals telling you it's the other way!) is about 50 dms (about \u00a33.78) and you can use that ticket to get in again as many times as you like). Really nice way to look at the history and the rooftop cafe is to be recommended- it is crazy cheap and they do lovely food, although there isn't a huge selection. Be careful about going there at really hot points of the day as not all of the tables are in shade so if it is busy you might be out in the boiling hot sun trying to eat!"

Outstanding value as your ticket allows you to go back as many times as you wish whilst in Marrakech. An oasis of calm that takes you on an historical journey of Marrakech. The food from the terrace was simply delicious. Maison de la Photographie was definitely the highlight of my visit to Marrakech."

Definitely go: an intriguing collection of historic photography of Morocco housed on several floors of a beautifully renovated riad with a small roof terrace restaurant. It\u2019s open long hours and worth the visit. Opened in 2009, this gallery, showing the owner\u2019s collection of historic photography of Morocco, 1870-1950, is a rich addition to sites in Marrakesh of art, architecture and cultural history. The collector/owner, who lived previously in the Himalayas, shows and sells prints from his collection of travel, documentary photography by travellers, anthropologists and others, primarily outsiders looking in on an exotic culture through an Orientalist lens. Yet these images give us a tangible sense of lives and actions, personalities, landscapes \u2013 wind, weather, dust and skin. It\u2019s a Morocco distant and gone, but it\u2019s also the Morocco that continues in the arid landscapes of the mountains of the moon, the pastoral stretches where Shilha boys still graze their sheep as their grandfathers did."

When walking around Marrakech you get the sense that while some things have changed due to the inevitable invasion of the modern world, there's a spirit to this place that hasn't changed in a millennia. The form of the old city is still there. It's just the technology that moves around in it that has changed. You walk around feeling that the long past of their ancient civilization is actually not that far back in time. Seeing these pictures from the early nineteen hundreds and later, show you that it wasn't that long ago and they are a wonder to look at.

To see Marrakech through the eyes of some amazing photographers is truly a treat and you get to see the souks in a totally different light. Highly recommended."

Keep your admission ticket...as long as you have proof of admission you can re-visit the museum again, anytime you like. There is a rooftop terrace where you can buy sodas, coffee, tea, and snacks. The view from up there is spectacular! Be aware: in an attempt to mislead you, you will be confronted in the streets by young people who will tell you the museum is closed. Smile, shake your head, and continue on. They are paid by the leather tanners to direct you to their shops, in the hopes that you'll purchase goods from them."

Nice cafe, lovely view I'm assuming you can't get anywhere else without access to a minaret.- The building itself is quite appealing inside.- It's very close to the Ben Youssef Madrasa and Musee de Marrakech, so easy to combine."

It takes all of 20 minutes in total to look round. Theres no real organisation or themes to the photos. The guy on the front desk was sweet and cheerfully told us we could come back again with the same ticket.for me it all felt a bit 'emperors new clothes'. there really are other more enjoyable things to do in wonderful marrakech."

On the first visit I enjoyed a drink on the terrace, on the second it was lunch. There is a small blackboard menu and on the day I ate, I had a chicken tagine and it was delicious.The images are beautifully presented and the videos are well worth watching, so make sure you have time, or take advantage of return visit.This is a photography museum and it has done an excellent job of presenting old images, but, I think new works are just as important as history is in the making. It would have been nice to see some new artistic photographic images of the Moroccan peoples in addition to the old ones."

However, as we made the mistake of standing in the street looking at a map and scratching our heads we attracted the attention of a local who \"happened to be going that way\". We followed him for 20 minutes and ended up at the tanneries. We made our feelings clear and he took us to the museum - another 10 minutes. Naturally he wanted paying so we gave him 20 dirahms (about \u00a31.60 with the advice that had he taken us straight to the museum he would have got 100.Anyway, we got there and it is a cool sanctuary of Berber culture history in pictures. Most of the work is from the 1920's and 30's with some interesting earlier work from the late 1800's. The top floor cafe is very good and served us the best tagine we had in Marrakech. With water, mint tea, bread and cous cous the cost was around \u00a38. The views are expansive but quite dull as buildings in Marrakech are pretty much the same height, but there is a good view of El Koutoubia Mosque Entry fee to the museum was 40 dirhams (just over \u00a33). It would be good to see some more modern works say from the 1950's to 70's when there were a lot of photo journalists working in North Africa but overall the difficulty of finding the place was worth it.As a matter of interest when we came out we walked about 50 yards and saw an area we had already passed many times before bumping in to the helpful local."

The children were in much more traditional dress than the trainers, and football strip which they seem to prefer to wear today. We sat for a while watching fascinating old films depicting life 70 years ago in Berber mountain villages, and then went up to the roof terrace for some much needed food. What a disappointment! After 20 minutes of waiting looking at the dirty dishes on our table, with other tables just sitting waiting as well, we left without even being asked why we were leaving! The views were certainly good across the city, but over stretched or no staff at all do not make for a good dining experience!

Well laid out out, and with information at regular points adding to the beautiful photography on display. Information available in English, which seems quite unusual in Marrakech's museums. Interesting film footage of hill/ mountain villages from the 1950s. Also, a lovely terrace restaurant, with a fabulous view over the city to the Atlas mountains. Lunch was a set menu which included a salad, chicken tagine with couscous, followed by set yogurt with strawberries. Food was good, but not the best tagine we ate. Also a little expensive at 80 MAD per person for the set menu before drinks."

Could do with a bigger place as only a small proportion of the collection is on show. Don't miss the rooftop cafe with good views across the city."

The staff were very good. The photographs are amazing, you can visit multiple times on one ticket and even an amateur will appreciate the photo opportunities on the terrace. The terrace gave the best unobstructed 360view of Marrakesh that I found. On your own or with the whole family this would be enjoyed by all."

Although not large the museum has some wonderful photographs of people and the souks. We spent about an hour wandering round the museum and seeing how Marrakech and Morocco in general has changed, or not changed! There is some great footage of the Berbers taken in the 50s which we sat and watched and although it was in French and we couldn't understand it, it was still really interesting. I would definitely recommend a visit."

I did a lot of travelling across the country, but wanted some older photos that illustrate the culture, history and Morocco's people. The ground floor has some stunning portraits. There is a second and third floor, and a terrace on top. It was great to see such amazing photos - many of them range from the late 1800's through to the 1940s. My prints are going to cost a fortune to frame back home - but they'll last me my life time and I'll have no regrets on the purchase."

And once you've explored the various collections, you can buy copies anywhere from postcards to full size and/or take in the views of the city from the rooftop cafe.Thing to bear in mind is, like everywhere in Marrakech, it can be hard to find and there will be \"helpful\" citizens who'll offer to show you the way. Best to do is head to the bigger sites nearby on your map, and ask shop keepers and museum staff for directions - they'll guide you the right way.Make sure you don't miss this beautiful gem!

The view of Marrakech from the roof-top terrace is the best I found during 10 days (visit it during sunset). The staff is very friendly and you can also buy prints. You can reuse the tickets and come back several times."

Do take time to read about this place before you visit - and perhaps after a few trip around the medina - because it gives you a context to the superb collection of photos. It is located in a old restored foundouk - a beautiful building. The terrace is lovely with a great view of the medina - but the lunch may not be worth it especially if you have already had your fill of tangines. A nice pot of mint tea is a nice alternative to contemplate the view from the terrace. The prints of photographs on sale are not very expensive - a pretty good and cheaper alternative are prints available in Gueliz including some of the shops near the majorelle gardens"

Entrance to the terrasse is inclouded, you can have traditional tea in the sun for 10Dh. Priceless is the view over Marrakech, the Medina and the close Mountains covered with snow. All is silent on top of the souks.Pay Entrance once and you can come as often as you want. During 1 week in marrakech in January 13 I used this chance three times."

We got very lost coming here but so glad we finally made it. The lunch is served on the terrace and the views are beautiful. You get a wonderful of the Atlas mountains and the medina. Lunch was 80dhs for a 3-course meal and it was absolutely delicious. So much better than the touristy place our local guide took us the day before. Amazing view, delicious lunch, gorgeous day, you can't get any better than that. The photo exhibitions were also moving and it really shows the history and changes of the country. I would definitely recommend to people of all ages and it's worth the trip!"

It was also wonderful to be able to think and read without being pestered for \"help\" or to look at trinkets. The only downside - it took 45 minutes walking around it to find it. It is difficult to find, and you will get incredibly annoyed with all the street \"helpers\" trying to ferry you away to the tanneries, or being continually told \"the market is this way, I'll show you\". We were also told it was closed for cleaning. Once we did find it, it was a calming breath of easement. We met Patrick who was extremely nice. Entry fee was inexpensive, and we got a short introduction from Mohammed who spoke English and was pleasant but knowledgeable. Go to the rooftop cafe, a stunning view - also something to behold when all the mosques start blasting the call to prayer. It's like one bullfrog croaking, then the others come to life."

Djemaa el-Fna is instantly recognizable from a century past, and even the Medina bears a striking similarity to its modern incarnation, albeit with slightly more advanced goods up for sale.The staff is young and multi-lingual, and they're eager to answer questions about the collection."

Once your done they have possibly the best roof terrace in Marrakech with the most stunning views of the atlas mountains. Take a seat, relax and order a tagine for about 40 dirham! It was the best tagine I had whilst in Marakech and was great place to chill for a while and soak up the views.

There isn't a great number of photos, but what they do have is interesting. The documentary playing on the second floor is particularly interesting as it shows village life in the 1950s or round about that time.

It gives you an idea of what a traditional middle class house looks like. I like the central courtyard, but we couldn't have one in Iowa. There is a nice cafe on the roof from what I hear, but we couldn't manage all the steps at our advanced age."

You can purchase print copies of the originals or, postcard sizes if you prefer. It's a pleasant place to while away an hour or so.

The images are impressive, a slice of history and popular culture in the past, and best of all, you can buy from the collection. Well worth a visit, particularly if you are already in the area and visiting the Ben Youssef Medersa."

This and the lunch menu (set menu - MAD 65 p.p. - salad, chicken tagine with lemon, and home-made yogurt for dessert) must make this one of the nicest spots in the whole city.

The food was excellent, and such good value at 65Dh for a three-course lunch of high quality. Mint tea at 10Dh, fresh orange juice at 12Dh, and the whole thing was superb. We spent 2hrs there enjoying it all, and although there is an entry fee of only 40Dh, the ticket is good for up to a week so that we can re-visit the terrace and enjoy the images again at no additional cost."

And the fact that it has a great rooftop terrace cafe makes it a great place to end your tour of that part of town. The exhibits at the Maison change, but seem focused on early photography by Europeans in Morocco. What we saw was fascinating and/but Orientalist. I'd love to see some exhibitions by Moroccan photographers there in the future, too. However, seeing how life was in the early C20 was very exciting. The staff were very helpful and gave us an careful introduction to the photos, which were beautifully laid out with detailed explanations. I appreciated the fact that this museum had a shop with postcards, books, posters, and more. The cafe has a lunch menu that is reasonably priced and changes daily."

Fabulous studies of individual profiles - haunting photographs of eyes projecting the souls of the subjects. Pictures of times gone by. Wonderful. Totally surprised by the expansive views from the roof where a tiny restaurant/tea room awaits. You can lounge on cushions and eat a delectable tajine of lemon chicken followed by lucious pastries and either coffee or tea. We spent an hour here eating, relaxing, enjoying the view before re-entering the fray of Marrakech's medina. Entry cost (60 dhms) allows you unlimited entry during your stay - so you can go back as often as you wish - the roof-top salon alone is worth it."

Later that week I descided to go back and take a look inside the museum. Both Patrick and his assistants are eager to take you on a trip through 19th century Marocco telling you all they know about the intriguing photographs they have. I won't spoil the fun by telling to much, but make sure to stop here and take time to see this. If only for the view from the roof-terrace. And if you go, make sure to ask the owner about the map of Marocco and Spain that you can find in a dark corner of the staircase. This is a very interesting story."

The other major plus point for the museum is the professional way in which it is run. The owner was incredibly friendly and welcoming, as were the staff; really knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the exhibits, but without the pushiness that seems usual in the rest of the Medina.

Such an amazing place....not only an interesting and beautifully curated exhibition but exceedingly intelligent and interesting staff and a real gem of a roof top terrace.As much as we loved the exhibition the terrace and the staff were the real find - the terrace had amazing views, we lounged on cushions and enjoyed one of the best tagine of our trip. To be honest we could have stayed there all day. We really enjoyed chatting with the staff and then as we were leaving had the pleasure of meeting the owner who was an incredibly interesting and friendly guy with whom we wish we'd had longer to talkto.A real gem and not to be missed."

            "review": "Best part of our trip. My mum and I were in Marrakech for 2 weeks and we did loads of things, this by far being the best! We actually almost didn't go as we weren't sure if it was really our thing but one day we had had enough of the souks and decided to try to find the museum. It is pretty easy to find, head up the main souks street off the main square - if you get lost, politely greet a shop owner with \"Salam Alaikum\" and ask which way to Medersa Ben Yousef (an old school), they will be more than happy to point you in the right direction - failing that someone will most likely offer to take you for a very small fee - this is what we did the first time we visited the museum as we were hopelessly lost! Once at Medersa B.Y. the museum is signposted and is about 5 minutes away. Entry is only 40 dh if I remember correctly. Stepping into the museum is a welcome relief from the mopeds and the heat, helped very much by the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. The owner(s) of the museum are lovely and we were given a tour of the ground floor photographs in english, the photos date back to the 1800's and depict people that had been abducted for slavery, regal looking women, all sorts. There are more pictures on the second floor and then on the third floor is access to the roof which has an amazing view overlooking the city where you can have a cup of tea. We went to the museum twice (didn't take enough money for all the things we wanted to buy the first time!) and were invited back for a cup of tea to watch the sunset and to see the city light up but unfortunately we fell ill and couldn't make it - I imagine it would be the nicest place of all the cafes overlooking the city to see the city change from day to night. We came away with 4 beautiful and highly professional prints and some posters which are also great quality. I hope the people we met at the museum read this review - it truly was the highlight of our trip, thank you!"

The traditional food is excellent! Don't miss the chicken and lemon tagine or the berber yoghurt!"

Ne manquer pas cette musee superbe!This gem of a museum offered hospitality and culture in equal measure.The rooftop terrace offered a superb 360\u00ba view of the city and mountains; with refreshments available as well, it was a welcome respite from the local streets where \"helpful\" guides were more than usually insistent on directing one to the tanneries; there was no limit to how long one could stay and relax. Staff were shorthanded on the day we visited but I believe it's possible to eat there as well; we had cold drinks.For the holiday visitor: highly recommended, a little awkward fo find if you haven't got the hang of the souks but clearly signposted from the Medersa Ben Joussef.The owner/curator was on hand to offer an indepth introduction to the collection which changes periodically; for the serious student of photography or ethnography this is a very important collection of Moroccan photographs, photographic techniques, information on photographic history, source of information for Moroccans on their own history. The collection is put together with passion and dedication, photographs on three floors.It was a cultural highpoint of our visit to the city, far more informative than the local standard."

It is located near the Medersa ben Youssef. You can easily see everything in less than an hour. Definitely worth a visit -- you are taken back in time and see how much Marrakech, like all cities, has changed over the years, and how in many ways how it has stayed the same! You should end your visit with a mint tea at the small rooftop terrace -- just magical."

We found the Maison de la Photogtaphie fairly easily as it was just round the corner from our Riad, however it shouldn't be too hard to find from the Medersa Ben Youssef as it is signposted. The entry fee is 40dh and it is well worth it. We must have looked rather hot as Patric, the owner, gave us some water and some delicious fruit (not quite sure what they were!) to cool us down while he introduced the collection to us.The museum is within a typical Riad, with three floors and a roof terrace as well (where you can have lunch). The rooms all have specific photographs, and the to floor has comfy cushions and a video (in French) plays on a flatscreen about the Berber villages and life in the mountains. Most of the literature is in French, however each individual photograph has its description also in English. Even with my awful French, I still enjoyed watching the video of the Berber villages.Overall, this is far more than a museum, its an experience!"

A poster in a Riad led me to want to find this museum, and I was not disappointed. It took a bit of effort to find, but there were signs at most of the places we might have made a wrong turn. I loved the photos on display, and spent some time looking at everything in the flat files as well. I ordered about 10 to have shipped to me in the States.....I liked them that much! The prints aren't editioned, but they aren't expensive either, and I certainly want to do my part to support this labor of love by Patrick, the charming owner, and Hamid, his partner who handles the printing. The place is a lovely oasis, with only old photos for the time being, but I think the plan is to incorporate more modern things as well. I would definitely recommend any visitor make the trip to the museum.....the journey is an added bonus, as you get off the beaten tourist track."

Sunset was breathtakingly wonderful, it easily competes with the Cafe de France as a viewpoint.Combined with the Medersa, the Museum de Marrakech, and the Koubba, this is a memorable package and its right in the middle of the real Marrakech.

I still went in. The young man (perhaps the manager?) in the entrance was very friendly and pleasant. The building is laid out in Moroccan-riad style: Central courtyard with a small fountain, open to the sky with small rooms directly surrounding it. There were movie posters and an old film projector on display there. Pictures were hanging on the walls, neatly lined up and organized. It was OK, but hardly impressive by any stretch of the imagination. There were 3 floors of photos on display.The REAL selling point of this place was the roof terrace. There are traditional cushions for sitting on the floor, carpets and low tables in the sunshine but also shade from the sun, if required. Refreshments can be served on the roof as well. Nice views of the High Atlas Mtns. and the medina too.All told, the entrance fee wasn't really worth it, but the terrace was a relaxing spot to just chill and converse with the fellow travellers who happened to be there at the time. Not a \"must-see\" stop in Marrakech, but if you happen to trip across it, check it out for a calm and panoramic terrace view away from the crowds."

Once you get into the general area where it is located, there are clear signs directing you.The curator met us on arrival and patiently explained the collection, which although rather small is well organized and of high quality. He was clearly very passionate about what the museum had achieved, and with good cause. An exhibition of Berber photographs was the special during our visit. The collection ends at the 1950s - I think this simply reflects the original collector's interests, so do not go expecting modern works reflecting contemporary Marrakech.After working you way up through the floors, do take lunch on the terrace: if you bring your camera (and why wouldn't you?) you will be rewarded.This place is a must for anyone with an interest in photography, and equally rewarding, if you simply want a rest from the frantic Medina."
