We chose St. James's Park instead. It was so beautiful and hard to believe so much nature is surrounded by such historical places, like Buckingham Palace, St.Paul's Cathedral and Big Ben. We will return again next year for sure!"

Later on we seat on a bank overlooking the pond, swimming pool for a great variety of water birds and ideal place for a couple love making swans. By continuing our walk we reached 'Buckingham Palace'."

It was a lovely afternoon and even in autumn the floral arrangements were quite splendid. The fountain was working and the entire experience was like being in an oasis in the middle of the city. I think this is a very underated park and one that is often overlooked in favour of others"

It was a fine day and the squirrels and birds were out in force. Many people were passing through and enjoying the park in countless ways. Sitting people watching and taking in the water foul and wildlife is very pleasant and this park was a great place to wind down and recharge for the coming tourist sites. A bit of the country in the middle of the city and to be honest you see more wildlife in an hour that you would on a country walk."

The park is about 23 hectares in area and contains several gardens and plenty of wildlife including squirrels, moor hens, ducks, geese and the famous pelicans. We walked along The Mall and back around the lake to Horse Guards. The park is beautiful and the walk is very easy. At the time of our visit the weather was very hot and there were a large number of families and tourists making the most of it. I have walked in St James's Park many times and never fail enjoy it. I think it a must for those wanting a break from their hectic day."

The amazing pelicans and all the very many birds are a reminder of this. You can imagine Charles II walking around chatting to people here (his palace, Whitehall was next door) and you can almost imagine his Dad, Charles I, walking through on his way to get his head chopped off (he had to wear two shirts as he didn't want people to think he was a shivvering coward when he was just shivvering from the cold). There's a great cafe that looks like the Teletubbies, and loos, and fantastic gardens which it's worth stopping and looking at. There's English history all around you (Whitehall, Buckingham Palace, The Mall where state visitors come down the red road, St James's Palace -after which the park was named, Soldiers marching up and down for the changing of the guard.....) and it's all free. Ice creams too. A Princess Diana walk begins here. What's not to like?"

Escape the hustle & bustle of the city, take in all the wildlife; ducks, geese and swans, and the squirrels, of which there are lots at the moment that WILL climb onto you even when you're not prepared! Beautiful well kept park, lots of places to sit & a mix of places to get food; thoroughly recommend particularly if the sun's out :)"

Gorgeous to wander through on a sunny autumn day and still teeming with wildlife. It's difficult to conceive that you're so close to the centre of the capital.It's almost 500 years since Henry the Eighth acquired the land to create a deer park. Improved by successive monarchs, it's existed in its current form for close on 200 years having been extensively remodelled by the famed landscape architect John Nash.Whether it's a romantic stroll or somewhere to entertain the kids, this is worth at least an hour of anyone's time."

If birds and butterflies could design a perfect setting, this would be it. We saw many varieties of birds (several were unfamiliar to us), in optimum habitats. There was even a large, flat boulder in the lake, which several grebes found to be an excellent spot for flapping (drying?) their wings. The park was enjoyed by young people, families, and retired folks; strolling, reading, or laying in the sun. It was an absolute delight of a place!"

Although there is a great variety of wildlife which lives in the park, I really don't like it when people feed the animals. They're not meant to be eating things like bread, popcorn or whatever other garbage people keep offering them. If you can refrain, please don't feed the animals.Otherwise, grab a meal at the Inn in the Park, or bring a sandwich to have a picnic on the grass. Take note: if you sit in one of those stripey chairs, someone might come by and ask you to pay up!"

The funny thing is most of the time, I just some small peek from the movie, I got the change to know this park better was from the game Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Which the location of the game happened to be in London. Although the timeline was in the past, but it is almost precise. It was quite a interesting experience for me to see many locations after the game. The park was so different with what I see in the game. Of course, there got some new coffee around, and buildings as well. There's a small bridge in the park that cross the lake, in the middle of that people could have a small peek of the Buckingham Palace."

There are grassy areas for picnics and plenty of benches for those who wish to just relax. A bridge and water fountain are also lovely features.

Appalling restaurant, limited seating tables not cleaned food on the seats and floor. Food very poor and very expensive staff not very helpful. My husband had a sandwich which was stale when he took it back he was told \" it's ok sell by date is not until tomorrow\" it was eventually changed. I had a small piece of quiche which was taste less and cold even though it was from the hot food counter and a small bowel of what looked like tomatoes but still not sure what they where, our grand daughter had a small sausage roll which she ate only because she was hungry and 3 small bottles of fruit juice for which I paid the princely sum of \u00a331.00 Toilets were an utter disgrace, smelly and dirty only 4 cubicles sanitary bins full and over flowing on to the floor, poor hand washing facilities.As I said the park is well worth a visit but I suggest you eat before you go or take a picnic and a packet of hand wipes."

Whoever decides on plant varieties to give such an extraordinary colourful display deserves recognition. The summer display had all the colours of the rainbow and blended marvellously - truly spectacular.The signage really interested me - how this space was originally marshland and over time, from the reign of Elizabeth I, and subsequent monarchs, was transformed into what it is today. Fascinating, too, that Charles II, after he returned from exile, used the park for exercise - swimming in the summer and iceskating in the winter. Of interest as well, was the Ornithological Society's association with the park, although, given the number of birds seen during my short visit, hardly surprising. Duck Island was a joy to behold with the gardens and the small Swiss Chalet located there. Again, a picture perfect postcard photographic opportunity.No surprise with the number of people on a summer\u2019s day in London enjoying the park as I was certainly doing, simply using it as a thoroughfare but really appreciating its use both now and in the past, those having picnics, playing games etc,A wonderful London gem."

The most ancient is Westminster, which has now become the Houses of Parliament, St James's Palace and of course the best known Buckingham Palace all can be seen walking around the park. Also in the park is Horse Guards Parade Ground the ceremonial parade ground where the Trooping the Colour take place on the Queen's official birthday each year.There is much more to see and do and all at no cost!!"

We enter at the Buck House end of the Mall by the pedestrian crossing, and stroll along the side of the lake, where you will see swans, moorhens, lots of wild birds. The flower borders are immaculately kept, and full of colour in spring and summer. The pathways can get really busy, but there are good facilities, including a cafeteria, outside and inside seating, and clean toilets. Sometimes, one can find Pelicans, but these tend to congregate at the other end of the lake and are very used to people, but you must not feed or touch them ! The Park ends near Horseguards Parade, and one can stroll across quite easily. There was an exhibition last year in the park on images of the first world war and worked really well. We have seen black swans on the lake at times. Lots to see and so easy to get back to the Mall from the park to see the soldiers and guards marching, or a procession. The floral borders near Horseguards Parade are full of colour during spring and summer season. A really well kept park, but then it is a Royal Park ! A good walk is from Green Park Station, through Green Park, across the mall, and through St James's Park through to Horseguards parade. There is some seating along the way if you become tired."

I\u2019m pretty much reiterating the same as the other reviews, this really is a beautiful great park. The river running through it, and the view of Buckingham palace in the background is stunning. We were lucky to be walking through it on a nice sunny day , not too hot, so it was perfect weather for a stroll. There was an ice-cream van in the middle, and plenty of people sitting on blankets, under trees. There a lot of birds around the river, but there is a little fence , and weirdly they seem to be quite happy behind it, although they can quite easily fly over. The squirrels are very friendly, and I watched a girl feeding one nuts, and it was a bit nervous, but kept repeatedly coming over to her and taking one out of her hand.It\u2019s quite a large park, and there a few different path ways, so you can walk different ways around if you wanted to."

The paths throughout are wide and paved smooth, so would be easy for walkers of all abilities. There are dozens of types of fancy birds to watch, plus squirrels and pigeons being fed by friendly local folks.

There are a ton of birds in the ponds and also walking around on the grass. Pigeons often come sit on shoulders and heads if u are eating something, and that can be so much fun!

I have personally not done this, yet.I recommend this to people visiting with friends, family and small children. It is fun for children because there are a lot of animals you can see, especially by the water.

Large expanses of grass provide space for picnicking or lounging, with plenty of trees for shade. It makes a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of the city streets."

I don't know why it is so special. The beauty, the fascinating and sometimes funny variety of waterfowl - who love to be fed and whom I love to feed - the sense of peace in the midst of a great city...perhaps the greatest ever on earth. From the bridge over the waterway, it is a sublime juxtaposition of old, new, and post-modern London. Green, gold, and blue parkland and waterway in the foreground, the historic architecture in the middle view, and - rising above it all - the London Eye, with its message of an ever-evolving and adapting city. I am visiting in October for the first time in years and am so excited be staying close to the park. I plan to be there as often as possible."

The playground is a great place for the adults to rest their feet while the kids run off their excess energy. The food is pricy but not surprising since it is the equivalent of amusement park fare (and the food looks a bit tastier than what you'd expect at Six Flags). It's also a great place for a picnic and people watching if you'd like to save a few bucks on feeding the brood, I know I will be remembering that for next time."

Also it is centrally placed and was originally bounded by 3 palaces: Buckingham Palace, St Jame's Palace and Westminster Palace (now the Houses of Parliment).

The day in question was very hot, so every bench and most of the green space was taken up by people trying to cool off in the shade and that is the only downside, that it can be very crowded.

Strolling in Greenpark for a while and i reached into the touristy Buckingham Palace, and St James Park became the next destination close by. The royal is really gorgeous in this summer with lots of beautiful flowers which i could not name them. The whole scenary was really photogenic and lots of families and tourists are just taking photos non-stop. This place was indeed a natural magnet for tourists.The British Restaurant in the park serves good food (which was unexpected) and i enjoyed its curry chicken pie so much."

The water, the bridge, the tres and other vegetation together with the animals and birds makes this park a real delight. Watching the squirrels is enjoyable and in one place I counted about six - England supposedly has many squirrels but you only seem to come across one of them occasionally. St James Park seems to be a very reliable place to see them and they are quite friendly, coming up and staring intently in the hope of you giving them something to eat. Hope to be able to go back there again."

When you go into this park, you do not feel like you are in the city.It is full of wildlife; they are all quite happy to have humans around too. I had squirrels walk up to me instead of having to edge towards them.The water had white and black swans, lots of varieties of ducks, geese, herons, and pelicans!!! Highly recommend if you are a nature person and animal lover."

It was a bright day and the park was bathed in a pleasant light.The park is essentially a large pond surrounded by lawns and flower beds, with a bridge crossing the pond. The pond is home to fish and countless types of birds, including pelicans that sometimes strut down the paths. There is a cafe and there are various ice cream and waffle vans dotted around. It lies between Whitehall and Buckingham Palace and is an oasis of calm in Central London.Nearest tube is St James's Park.Highly recommended. "

There is usually a pelican or three, just casually standing around, unbothered by the general public and a few swans on the lake. We were lucky enough to be there last week for the Queen's birthday celebrations.

My partner watched the parade whilst I found a quiet spot to relax. Despite this being a busy day there was still plenty of room for those of us that wanted a little piece and quiet away from the crowds. There are some great views too - Buckingham Palace at one end of the lake and Horseguards at the other. Both magnificent sights. 20p to spend a penny. There is a caf\u00e9 and a refreshment hut. There are plenty of birds on the lake, including pelicans! St James's was the first of the Royal parks to open to the public and is steeped in history. You can even hire a deck chair - prices start at \u00a31.60 each for up to one hour. Take your camera!"

On our last day we went back armed with a bag of nuts and found a lovely place to sit and as soon as the squirrels heard the rusteling of the packet they came over but were then inundated with pidgeons and found ourselves giving in and feeding them instead they were all over us and we loved it it was so much fun and I believe they are a misunderstood and under valued birds, they have amazing shimmering colours to their necks.  We walked around the park taking in all the joys of the surroundings and were delighted to be a foot away from Herons and Pelicans. It was by far our most favourite park."

I've not been to London since I was a little girl so a little bit naive in the location of attractions - Buckingham Palace being just at the end of the park.My kids loved the park grounds, the freedom to run ahead along the paths was lovely as we could see them. The lake is stunning, with lots of ducks, ducklings, and pelicans. The youngest day was made by finding the fabulous play area, she particularly loved the musical dancing board. We heard a band practising and were lucky enough to catch the run thru for Changing Of the Guard for the Queens birthday. We got lots of fabulous photos from the park of Buckingham Palace and The Mall.You can spend quite a few hours in the park, there are toilets, refreshments, and seating areas."

If you like birds, you will see plenty of them especially waterfowl, including herons and ducks. I didn't get to see any of the pelicans, but they are fed daily at 2:30 PM so that would be your best bet to catch them. The cafe on the grounds (\"Inn the Park\") has a clean free restroom and some delectable-looking desserts which I failed to partake in.With attractive grounds and plenty of people-watching opportunities, St.James's Park makes for a pleasant environment for making your way to such attractions as the London Eye and Big Ben."

The toilets were clean but not free (only 20p for goodness sake!) Friendly squirrels will take nuts from your hand and the pelicans will take your hand so heed the signs and don't attempt to feed them. Nice views across the lake.

Then unhelpful staff at kiosk had no first aid kid, paper towel or ice they could offer a screaming toddler with blood everywhere. We had to buy a ice lolly which was fine but any decent service would have offered more compassion. I'd hate to think of their response if the situation had been any worse!! Also adults are not allowed to use the toilet facilities - so your options are to drag your kids away from the park miles away for the loo or take your kids into the toilet and use it anyways which we did but saw dozens of frustrated adults being told they couldn't use empty facilities. That's a rule book went wrong!!! There is a guy stained in the toilets doing absolutely nothing all day - ohh and he didn't have a first aid kit either! Signage of where to go to get to where could be improved too. Otherwise park itself lovely ."

Like many city parks, they are nice because getting green space and tranquil surroundings in the heart of the city can be refreshing. My favorite thing while walking through was seeing and hearing a Swan take flight was terrific. Hearing the sound of its wings flapping while trying to generate enough force to get airboune drew my attention. Seeing its wing span and watching it get airbourne I had never witnessed, so it was pretty enjoyable. It circled and landed. That is about what I remember of the park."

You are in the park 1 minute and it's warm and sunny, the next 'It's Raining Cats and Dogs' per London speak. Then in 10 minutes the rain is over and the sun back out.

Most of all, I enjoyed walking on the wide paths between the trees and admiring all the fun everyone was having on a sunny afternoon - both locals and tourists. Cons: Nothing really."

You can travel to here via tube to green park, Piccadilly circus or westminster and a little walk then your at the park. There is plenty of space to have a picnic or just a walk from the horse guards parade all the way to Buckingham palace. There is a bar called in the park which is very pricey so id advise brining own food and drink as 4 small glasses of wine \u00a327! . There are ice cream sellers and its just very relaxing. Very safe for children as the water areas are all fenced off. This location is good to walk to big ben, london eye , trafalgar square. We use this all the time ."

I'd fit St. James's Park in my London itinerary in the way connecting Buckingham and Big Ben/Westminster, it is the perfect way to do it, specially if it is a sunny day.The park is big and pleasant to walk by. It has a lake with a big variety of ducks that are very used to tourists and free bread. Also you may find pelicans and other birds. Very sympathetic squirrels will approach you with no fear, they are very funny and interested in everything you have to offer them, once more bread would be perfect... or cookies. They are so used to it that when they have many people at the same time giving them food, they choose the biggest piece :-)It's easy to photograph those little creatures here. In the park you also have a coffee house that serves breakfast all morning. It is near the lake and it has always a full house so you may have to wait a little bit for a table.Here you may also make a picnic and you'll find near the The Mall entrance some garden chair that are for rental so you may enjoy the sun. While wondering you can imagine this park in the old days when ladies and sirs, kings and queens used to take walks and enjoy their mornings and afternoons.From here you may see above the tree line London's Eye and Big Ben that is almost around the corner.Some pavilions exist along the park, I loved the thai style of the pavilion in front of Churchill War Rooms."

There are tourists, people chatting everywhere, kids running around after all the ducks and birds, etc. Though I gotta say the view of the London eye from here is beautiful and also the architecture and landscaping. Def swing by if your going to Buckingham palace though expect it to be packed of people. Beautiful park next to Buckingham palace, though I would say way too tourist packed and kind of ruins the relaxing peacefulness a park like this should have."

Both Lush green grass and trees with the remains of blossom, or with fresh young leaves provide a background to vivid formal flower beds. Blackbirds and tits perch above borders tinged with yellow/green euphobias and sky blue forget-me-nots. Wilder areas, wildfowl-only areas sway with tall grass and bluebells, that sparkle blue and pink. The lake is the centre. Cross by a blue bridge, or walk around the circumference, taking in Buckingham Palace and Horseguards Parade. Two little islands covered with trees and blossom sit near the edges. There are fountains too. You will see an interesting assortment of wildfowl here, from swans to pelicans, ducks to geese. And several heron. There are [at least] two families of Egyptian geese who walk proudly beside their new goslings. Coots build arks of nests on water made of collected twigs and leaves. Their young appear later. A swan is also nesting, in a safe corner....Don't miss the views from the bridge!You may also see and hear the guards as they march up the Mall. The resturant here is a great place for coffee, or, a meal. I like to sit with a coffee on the roof sitting area; what a view from here too![Or, go to Struuton Ground before you come and get something from Ecco or Le Pain Du Jour there. Great food and reasonably priced] This is [one of ] my very favourite London Parks. And it's possible to walk to Green Park to go to the tube or to Piccadilly, or to walk on to Hyde Park and the museums in South Kensington, or even Trafalgar Square, just around the corner. ."

We were interested in looking at Buckingham Palace and took a walk through St James Park to get there.The weather made a big difference as it was glorious, but the park is brilliant. Only minutes away from Piccadilly Circus who'd have thought that you could find the fantastic gardens, lake and grass areas of St James Park. The flowers at the moment are unbelievable, as was everything else. There were a lot of people around but it definitely didn't feel crowded.If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a while then try St James Park."

We decided to walk through the park to reach \\horseguards Parade; it was an excellent idea and we strolled happily, admiring the flowers, fountain in the pond, the pelicans and the house where the \"parkie\" - superintendant - used to live and which is now, apparently, offices and has interesting flower beds and a \"tiled piece of art\" in the garden. Lovely to wander; later in the season it will be a super place for a picnic and/or to visit the building we could see off across the pond, which would no doubt sell assorted goodies ... on this occasion we were making for Horseguards; next time we'll just enjoy a visit to the beautiful park!!!"

Although Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are bigger and more open spaces, St. James's Park is the perfect choice for anybody looking to stretch their legs and bodies on the nice greenery. Surrounded by Horseguard's Parade and The Mall, with Westminster and the South Bank nearby, it is a convenient stop point during the summer when the sun is at it's hottest. Although there are food vendors nearby, you can get cheap eats from the local Tesco's and Sainsburys which are situated near Westminster and Trafalgar Square, which are both within walking distance.The Horseguard's Parade side was used recently for second-unit filming of the James Bond blockbuster SPECTRE on a couple of evenings. The Mall was where hundreds of thousands of people camped out in April 2011 as Prince William and Kate Middleton got married, before being led by duty police officers towards Buckingham Palace to witness their two kisses, as well as them driving from the Palace to St. James's Palace in their car with JUST MARRIED on it.There is a lot of pond wildlife to be witnessed and a few squirrels scurrying around on the grass and up the trees, so all in all, a worthwhile place to camp down if you want a breather from the pace of the West End...."

If you fall into this category, plan on taking a stroll through London\u2019s St. James Park. Our fellow travelers\u2019 photos offer many examples of the photographic possibilities this readily accessible and beautiful park has to offer. When you go, make sure you walk on the footbridge that crosses the center of the lake and take in the view to the east toward the Thames and London Eye. From this point you are guaranteed a great London landscape photo. Two of our March 2016 photos of the view are attached. We image the view is even more spectacular when the park is in full bloom. Bottom line, if you are always on the lookout for a great photo or your kids for cute squirrels, add this park to your London itinerary.If you found this review helpful and/or our photos, we hope you will click the \u201chelpful\u201d button; those of us who write reviews really appreciate the feedback and it motivates us to write more. Thank you."

The park is extremely well maintained, with so many different types of plants and trees. Some of these trees are so large and old, they look ancient! Living there are as many species of duck and goose as you can imagine, pelicans, squirrels, etc. The water was clean, covered in feathered friends, and surrounded by the most breathtaking plants I've ever seen. There was a willow tree there that was just stunning! If you like nature, and need to get away from the bustle of the city, this is the place to go. I could spend all day just walking the trail over and over."

It's compact size makes it easy to see all it's attractions, and the fact it is surrounded by Buckingham Palace, the suburb of Westminster (Westminster Abbey is a few blocks away), Churchill War Rooms, 10 Downing Street, Horse Guards Parade, Trafalgar Square, St James's Palace and Clarence House, means that it is easy to access. Gently sloping lawns dotted with deckchairs; trees blocking out most of the buildings; weeping willows lining the Lake; ducks, swans, and other waterfowl swimming in the lake or sleeping on the banks; stunning flowerbeds; amazing views of Buckingham Palace from the blue bridge; the beautiful fountains; the King George VI and Queen Mother memorial; Admiralty Arch; and above all - peace and quiet. Inn the Park is a restaurant located inside the park, and there are also various food stands throughout the park. There's public toilets at the eastern end of the Park, near Horse Guards Rd. Wheelchair accessible. Absolutely unmissable!!!"

The gardens are meticulous and the lawns are well kept. This is a real oasis in the middle of The Smoke. If you are a twitcher there are lots of birds to admire (feathered type) including the resident Pelicans. If you take a stroll down The Mall you'll get the views of Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square. Other notable places are Horse Guards Parade, Downing Street, The Churchill War Rooms and other famous locations. The park also connects Piccadilly via Green Park. Start at the corner of Birdcage Walk and walk clockwise around the park. Take some nibbles for the tame squirrels and they'll feed out of your hand. Also go near the south end of the small bridge and you can feed the Starlings and Blue Tits ala Mary Poppins\"! If you are lucky you might see a royal (they really do walk around the park). Don't take a dog off a lead as you will be fined."

If you want to see Changing the Guard, and it is well worth the effort, be aware it is on alternative days and subject to change.

It holds many memories for me, especially of the former park keeper who in the 1970's was in charge of the famous Pelicans, Paul being his favourite, and the star of the lake. I loved to watch him feed them with raw fish. Today it is a much busier park than it used to ever be, but it still has charm and is worth a visit, especially as you can easily get to many of the capital's attractions in no time from strolling through it, and on a bright morning it will set you up for the day ahead."

If you're going to Changing of the Guard, don't rush up to the palace gates, you won't see anything. Instead, stand on the mall opposite Buckingham Palace right by the footpath into St James' park. Once the band etc have marched past, at around 11.30 you can take yourselves down into the cool quiet of St James' park , get yourself a tea/coffee and feed the birds. If you've got any energy left in your legs take a stroll over the footbridge and you'll get wonderful views towards Horseguards and Buckingham Palace. Then, just before midday, go back to your spot opposite the palace and see the bands etc leave. You'll be perfectly placed to march along with them back to the barracks if you like."

The park serves as a great meeting ground, as well as an opportunity for numerous photo ops, like in front of the Buckingham Palace, the Horse Guards Parade, and The Mall. Also, you can see Westminster Abbey, the London Eye, and St. James Palace. It is next to many historical places as well, such as Her Majesty's Theatre, 10 Downing Street, Churchill War Rooms, the National Gallery, and many Museums. Tons of transportation options like bikes, taxi and bus stops, at least 4 metros within a block, and of course walking, because everything is so close."

Keep walking in vaguely the same direction to the left of the pond and you will eventually reach a lovely bridge from which you get a great view of Buckingham Palace to the left and what looks like a Russian skyline to your right. Continue on through the Park, and in due course you will reach Buckingham Palace, and nearby is the smaller \"Green\" Park and the larger Hyde Park. If you want to walk the latter, do, and check out the Serpentine. Also look on web for the Royal Parks and do some digging, they have .pdfs with maps of the Royal Parks.

This place exudes peace and tranquility, and that's what makes it special. The fact that it is literally across the street from Buckingham Palace and can accomplish this makes it worthy of a gold star. I can't wait to visit in a warmer season, sit on a bench, and take it all in."

It is bordered on one side by the mall and the other side is the residents of the queens guard. There is a small lake in the center of the park that is usually filled with a variety of waterfowl. We sometimes go to the park after dinner with small bits of bread and crackers to feed the ducks."

Originally a marsh, it was Henry VIII who drained the area and made it his Royal Hunting grounds. In the 17th century, Charles II had the park redesigned to be pedestrian friendly with a large aviary(thus the Birdcage Walk where the aviary was located). In the 18th century the famous landscape architect, Capability Brown laid out the park that we see today. Colorful herbaceous borders, stretches of grass and large stands of trees fill the park.There is a pleasant cafe, a lake with over 40 species of waterfowl and a bandstand for concerts. Views toward the palace across the lake provide good sites for photos. St. James' park tube station is a block south of the park."

It was necessary for us walk through St. James\u2019s Park and then up the Mall, to reach the Palace.The stroll through St. James\u2019s Park was very enjoyable. The combination of the charming mature trees, the beautiful flower beds, the pleasant lawn areas and the nice lake made for lovely environment, in which to walk.The lake was full of a variety of birdlife, whilst some visitors encouraged the pigeons on the pathways and footbridges, by feeding them. There were plenty of park benches provided where, if you desired, you could take a rest and enjoy your beautiful surroundings. The park also has kiosks where you can purchase takeaway food, ice-creams, cool drinks, tea and coffee. However, the prices charged by these outlets for their food and drinks are not cheap! There were also public toilets.From our experience, the park is a lovely place for a stroll in the sunshine. It would also be a very nice place for a picnic, as long as you bring your food and drink with you, rather than purchasing it there."

There are always people being photographed on the bridge.You can relax on the lawn. There are stands, which sell refreshments. Bands play occasionally in the gazebo just as in Victorian times.The Park also acts as a convenient access route, an alternative to the city streets. As mentioned earlier, it runs most of the way from the Palace to Big Ben. However, it runs all of the way from the Palace to the Churchill War Rooms and Horse Guards Parade. The Mall, the large ceremonial avenue that runs along the north side of the Park connects Trafalgar Square to the Palace. (By the way, from the Palace, it is a pleasant stroll through the Green Park to Mayfair, Piccadilly and Hyde Park."

You can duck through it to catch the different vantage spots to see the Changing of the Guards as well. It's also where we saw our first squirrel...yes, a highlight for Australians :-) Some beautiful photo spots throughout the park as well with views to Buckingham Palace in one direction and London Eye & Westminster the other as you cross the bridge."

St James boasts some of the finest landscaping and thus views of all the London parks. The stunning lightshow it enjoys each sunrise and sunset is amazing.

It is a pleasant park with a lake and two islands. One of which has Pelicans. It is about the size of 30 football pitches. There's views of Buckingham palace framed by trees - perhaps, the best view of the palace is there. The park is the most easterly of a virtually continuous strip of parks: Green Park, Hyde Park, and Kensington Gardens. Get there by tube and head for one of St. James's Park or Green Park. You could choose Victoria, or Westminster tube stations as alternatives. The park is bounded by Buckingham Palace to the west, The Mall to the north, Horse Guards to the east, and Birdcage Walk to the south. It meets Green Park at Queen's Gardens with the famous Victoria Memorial at its centre (opposite the entrance to Buckingham Palace). The smaller palace, St. James's Palace, is on the opposite side of The Mall. So you could easily have a day out looking in and around the park. If you're up to the walking a visit to Buckingham Palace is best done in this context I find. Somehow you see it better."

After a day running around and visiting places with some friends who came over from Japan, we went to visit St James Park... we suddenly realised we were quite tired and decided to rest our feet and relax a bit. Amazingly 2 squirrels just stood in front of us, probably waiting for some food.. My friends couldn't believe their eyes, they had never seen such friendly squirrels before. We managed to relax and enjoyed the beautiful park just opposite Buckingham Palace"

There are squirrels being chased by asian children, and many spots for photographic opportunities especially a bridge in the mid point of the park which crosses the center of the lake.

Situated between Buckingham Palace and The Horse Guard Parade ground, it is something to enjoy and a pleasure to stroll through. As we were walking through the park a squirrel came running towards my girlfriend and I. I made the effort to move aside but it continued on it's straight path towards me. I stopped to assess what was going to happen- well this little squirrel put it's little foot on my foot looked up at me and then proceeded to climb up my leg. Of course my sudden movement made it jump off me but the surprise was well worth the laugh and I will always appreciate the kindness and trust of the English Squirrel!Don't use the Mall to get from point A to B- take advantage of this lovely park and enjoy the views!

Small, by London park standards it offers a very good restaurant and caf\u00e9, a large area of deck chairs, a long lake full of an extraordinary variety of wild birds and, most importantly for my dog, lots of squirrels.

I ended up walking the whole length of the park toward Buckingham Palace, then down the Mall back toward the National Gallery. It's a fabulous park. It was a good break from the people, museums, and congestions that one can face as a tourist in London."

Visited as part of a long weekend in London.After walking from Westminster and through Horse Guards Parade we decided to have a walk around the park, so glad we did. The trees, gardens and flowers and extremely well kept and are a joy to be among. The park is huge so never really feels crowded even on a busy Saturday afternoon.Two downsides in my opinion;1) Having to pay to use a public restroom2) The so called 'restaurant' .. we decided to have lunch whilst in the park on Saturday afternoon, the food on offer at self service amounted to a chicken leg which looked like it has been sitting out for days, some chips which were the same and something I think was meant to a curry of some sort but was so odd looking in colour that it was hard to be sure.We decided to give this a miss, found a local supermarket, brought a couple of sandwiches and returned to the park to enjoy a small impromptu picnic, which was far more enjoyable than the restaurant experience.On the whole in my opinion, the park is well worth a visit but if you want to eat take you own food and avoid restaurant."

I did feed them and they take the nuts out of your hand and then they run away again, to come back for a new nut of course. It's the park next to Buckingham palace and it's nice to walk through it before the famous changing of the guard. But I recommend to go here on other days or times, because it will be a busy place before and after the guard change. Unfortunately there is (not at this time of the year I guess, because there was a stand, but closed) food for sale here."

I took my daughter there after a long morning at Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace while my husband and older daughter toured the Churchill War Rooms. It was just what she needed to cheer up and get a second wind, and it was a wonderful place for me to take candid pictures of her and the lovely surroundings. The Princess of Wales Memorial Walk goes through the park past a lovely waterway with dozens of different species of birds. The swans are photogenic, but standoffish, but the rest of the birds are quite friendly and will eat from your hand or off your jacket if you let them. (If you are not inclined to feed birds, don't worry; they will ignore you in favor of the other park goers). The bridges in the park are ideal for playing Poohsticks or for getting lovely photographs. The London Eye can be seen over the scenery in the park for a real picture perfect postcard view. There is also a cafe in the park which we visited for lunch one day and for afternoon tea on another. St. James Park is near the time station, but it is also near other attractions that you would likely be visiting anyway. This makes St. James Park ideally situated for taking a rest during a long day of touring London."

There is a little play park up near Buckingham palace that is a welcome distraction if my daughter is with me, the squirrels are endless fun with their cheeky antics, the kiosks selling coffee and ice cream are great and a wee seat on a bench watching the birds with a coffee is a real pleasure. It is a great people watching location and is also god for a wee picnic."

After enjoying ourselves there we walked back toward our hotel by way of St. James's Park. We were enthralled with the beautiful flowers and shrubs, so cleverly coordinated with the landscape surrounding the ponds in the park. There were numerous species of water fowl present, and they are so used to people that we were able to enjoy them up close. There were sling chairs located throughout the park and lots of benches lining the pathways.One reason this park is such a wonderful place to visit is that there are so many astounding architectural buildings visible through the trees, beyond the bridges, over the lakes, etc. If you take the time to take in all the beautiful vistas you will not be disappointed. I intend to spend a few more hours in St. James's Park before I leave, a pretty, pretty place."

A nice place to hangout with friends and to be make friends with the nature. A lot of birds and squirrels out there.. But be ready to make a long walk back to the tube station. Request to all travelers not to feed the animals with whatever you have, coz these food which you carry may not be the best for the birds. If you insist in feeding the birds or squirrels, please carry some food which is recommended for them. Also, please do not litter the beautiful garden. I see a lot of people not really caring about the environment. A little care will help our future generations enjoy these places as well."

The pelicans are fed every day between 2.30 and 3pm on duck island (the Horse Guards end of the lake - the other end to Buckingham Palace).Toilets in the park are on the left hand side of the path leading up to Malborough gate on The Mall; 20p to p**! There is a water dispenser there too where you can fill your water bottle. More toilets are near the park office.Deck chairs are available for hire; someone comes round and sells you a ticket. The children's playground is at the top left hand side of the lake, the Buckingham Palace end. There are ice cream kiosks which also sell drinks and light snacks and the park restaurant Inn the Park is worth a visit but I find it pricey. Better to walk through the park than go along the road and do take time to stand on the blue bridge and admire the views. If you cycle, beware, there is a \u00a360 fine for cycling in the park."

This is a wildlife lover's paradise!The huge pond area is home to so many bird species, from the familiar, such as Canada Geese and Mute Swans, to the more unusual, such as Bar-Headed Geese, a small flock of Pelicans, and many more. I have never seen so many coots in one place - there must have been around 50 all chasing after food thrown to them!The geese in particular are not shy, and will right come up to you as you sit and eat your picnic and stare at you, waiting for food! The pigeons too are extremely brave, and perch on the little fences so that you can photograph them close up! This park also has the friendliest Grey Squirrels I have ever seen! Again, you can get right up next to them and they are full of cheeky personality!It's easy to while away a long time strolling around just enjoying the animals and birds.There is a lovely natural play area for children, made out of carved logs, with a seesaw, swings, slide, climbing area, and most interestingly, a sand area set among rocks you can climb on. This isn't a standard sandpit in shape; instead it swirls naturally around the rocks. There is a food outlet next to this area, and also toilets, but these are strictly for children only, and adults need to use the ones a few minutes walk away instead.My only negative comment is that the proper toilets there were among the dirtiest I have encountered anywhere, which is awful given the prestigious location and the fact that there is an attendant there, and a small fee! They were clearly not being checked at all. Very disappointing. A coin change machine is available beside them.There are plenty of food and drink kiosks dotted around, selling ice creams, cakes, very nice flapjacks, hot dogs and so on, plus a restaurant/cafe.Despite the huge number of locals, workers and tourists using these gardens, it is easy to find a spot away from everyone to relax, and plenty of shade available for hot days.Good views of Buckingham Palace one way, and Horse Guards Parade overlooked by the London Eye the other, can be obtained from the Blue Bridge in the middle of the park.The Buckingham Palace end of the park is obviously a must to visit, but also worth a look is the Horse Guards Parade end. The pelicans are on their rock down this end. Cross the road and you will find a simple but beautiful memorial to those who died in the 2002 Bali bombings, and the unusual but effective memorial to police killed in the line of duty. A book lies open in this documenting those killed in recent years and how they died. Several other important memorials are also located in this area.A wonderful park in so many ways. Highly recommended!"

I wish the weather had been better but luckily some of the benches were under enormous trees which kept the drizzle off us nicely! My 7 year old son enjoyed spotting the squirrels as they scampered freely around the park, there were loads of them, as well as all the different birds. We saw the pelicans on their island in the lake, lots of geese and ducks as well as the usual pigeons. We strolled up to Buckingham Palace for a look and if the rain had eased up we would have spent some time looking around but it was not to be, so back into the shelter of the trees we went. We did find a play area which my son enjoyed though my 11 year old daughter wasn't impressed. She was more impressed by the nutella covered waffle I bought her from the little van near the play area, I was not impressed by the price I paid for it!!

The park is very large, with a bar/restaurant by the 'lake'.Still lots of people, but if you get off the main path..it's relaxing enough.In great walking distance to Trafalgar Square & Buckingham Palace.Nice change from the touristic madness of the hot spots!"

It's got pretty lakes, a cute little 'house' on an island (to look at), very tame squirrels, and the most actively maintained flower borders I've seen in any municipal park. And views to Buckingham Palace (so some good photo ops).Tourists or office workers needing to chill (doing both gets frenetic) would do well going there, perhaps not actively as a destination in its own right, but walking through from the chaos of the changing of the guards, emerging in Westminster near to the Abbey & Houses of Parliament, or Horseguards for the War Rooms- good use of time"

Situated between Buckingham Palace and Horseguards Parade and bordered by The Mall and Birdcage Walk (well known London roads) this park has a peaceful feel as soon as you enter it. There are lots of areas to sit down and relax and many people use the park as a place to grab a drink and a snack and have a few minutes away from the city rush (numerous kiosks can provide refreshments from within the park.)The park has a numerous fine features within it. St James's Lake offers many a pretty backdrop for the tourist snap with a range of birds often seen on the lake. Indeed, at the East end of the lake is Duck Island, a mini nature reserve within the park. Here if lucky you might get a good snap of the pelicans.Other good photo opportunities come from the Blue bridge that spans the lake (and leads to both a refreshment kiosk and public conveniences - both essential with children I find!) From the bridge you can get excellent shots of both Buckingham Palace and the London Eye.None of this however would register as my childrens' favourite element of the park. For them it is the grey squirrels. Many of these are now tame and with little persuasion will eat a range of nuts and tit-bits from your hand. We tend to let others do that part but offer snacks close to them and watch as they come up and eat the offerings.The other good part about St James's Park is simply the location. Close to so many other iconic London buildings and settings, it really is a beautiful urban oasis of calm in the big city."

It was a fantastic spot for our youngest to run out some energy and take a break from the museum/church circuit. My husband stayed here at the park with her while my teen and I went to Westminster Abbey a couple blocks away. We met back up and my husband then toured the Churchill War Rooms (across the street) while the kids and I made our way across the bridge to the London Eye. You could also visit Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, and several other sites from here in an easy walk. Lovely place to take a break or have lunch away from the crowds!"

Although not a mountain trail, St. Jame's Park offers the quiet and solitude a soul runner like myself needs. I must admit that my first try was disappointing as half of London must have been there. Then I switched to my regular American running time of 5:30am and presto !, no Brits, no Americans, no anyone... except the birds, the geese and squirrels. Loved it. Nice short run so I did it thrice and ran back to the hotel. Don't miss this lovely historic park. The lake is tranquil and the bird life active and plentiful."

St. James's park has a great location, a short walk from a tube station, across the road from Churchill War Rooms, and directly adjacent to Buckingham palace. With so many major attractions nearby, St. James's park is a nice place to take a breather from the crowded, bustling city. The park is very green, and with all the animals and trees, you almost feel like you are taken out of the busy city for a few moments. There are park benches that you can sit on (if there are any spaces available), and have a snack between visits to attractions."

Most of the big geese ate right from our hands. If you enjoy birds, there are many different breeds in the park and you can get excellent pictures.

Plenty of space to sit and relax, and just watch the world go by. Very popular with picnickers of all ages, plus there is a very good restaurant located inside the park. There are also toilets available in case you need them. My tip: especially in late spring and summer, take a picnic hamper with you, some blankets for placing on the grass, and just enjoy this beautiful place. Don't forget to take some extra bread to feed the large assortment of ducks and wildlife, and maybe some nuts for the very tame squirrels. The park is free entry."

We had a picnic here at the small lake, saw many birds, ducks and swans mostly. They are very much used to people so I would keep a close eye on kids here- swans bite often. I imagine that in summer months it is packed with people and would not be the same , as it is very close to the palace."

St. James Park is well-positioned between Buckingham Palace, Churchill War Rooms, Horse Guards Parade, Green Park and Pall Mall. It makes for a wonderful, peaceful break amid all the sightseeing. Plan for lunch or afternoon tea at Inn the Park, a lovely little restaurant on the grounds. (I believe you can make reservations on-line.) Great for nature and people-watching. The Park is home to many species of water fowl, exotic and otherwise, and lush gardens. Don't miss the gardeners' cottage structure on the end of the lake with its beautiful flower plantings. For more of a big-open-spaces, throwing- a-frisbee kind of park, head to nearby Green Park."

New cafe now & no sparrows but many of the old attractions remain the pelicans who are usually to be found near the picturesque old cottage that sits by the lake up at the Horse guards Parade end of the Park, also the excellent flower displays, shrub beds & the stunning mass of daffodils that flower under the trees alongside The Mall in Springtime. Of course, the whole Park is surrounded by Historic buildings & tourists abound, which is the only minus point as on occasions the Park is crammed. Fabulous views along the lake, many waterbirds to admire & feed, nice little mini cafe by Buckingham palace end, plenty of bold squirrels & pigeons to feed by hand. Not many cities where you can walk across 3 different Parks in a row as I do whenever I get the chance. Start in Hyde Park then into Green Park & finally into St. Name's Park. All the way from Bays water Rd to nearly the Houses Of Parliament!"

These include Clarence House, Marlborough House, St.James\u2019s Palace, Lancaster House, 10 Downing Street, and Wellington Barracks where on the day of our visit troops were leaving the barracks for the ceremony of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace. The centrepiece of the park is a large lake around which are numerous colourful flower beds. There are a number of statues in the park, and a restaurant by the lakeside. Our visit coincided with lunchtime so there were a number of suited office workers taking the opportunity to have lunch and stroll the park."

Go at 2 to watch the pelicans being fed, but do take plenty of peanuts and bread to feed the squirrels and birds. Laze around in the sun, have ice creams and generally spend a great afternoon here! We went twice - and even though tourists love it, the weekdays were much less crowded and easier for the kids to enjoy."

From the hustle and bustle just ten minutes prior to entering, and it actually being quite a busy park (the day we visited anyway!) it was still serene and peaceful. We were able to watch the ducks and lots of various other birds on the water (we only saw one notice board that named the bird types with pictures but there may have been more information boards that we missed) Friendly squirrels that actually come right up to you to see if you have food for them, fabulous for kids and big kids alike! No litter in sight around the park despite there being a few food and drink vendors situated by entrances/exits, so as well as people being on there best behaviour and putting rubbish In bins the rangers seem to keep on top of things too! Cannot talk further about the food and drinks vendors as we didn't actually pay any attention to them walking past knowing we were eating later in the day other than to say an icecream van was definitely one of them. Beautiful flowers dotted around the place, and some perfect spots for pretty scenic photographs."

There is a lake that covers the length of the park and therefore the vegetation is a bit different with all these over-hanging trees over the lake. It was nice because there were loads of swans and ducks and one would be surprised by the speed they swim. The park is over-crowded because there are all these tourists, overhang from the changing of the guards or on their way to Whitehall. We can even see the London Eye from the park.

Unforgettable experience you will enjoy. Park offers strolls along long lake water feature, ice creams, friendly squirrels which will come to your hand, benches you can rest on, etc. At the end of it there is fabulous Buckingham Palace (watch the flag on the top of it - flag up: queen is in, flag f=down: she is somewhere else). You can then carry on walking either via streets along the palace (on the left side) to Westminster Abbey and Houses of Parliament (Big Ben) or through Green Park (on the right of Buckingham Palace) and right into Ritz for a coffee (no shorts accepted at the entrance!) or simply take a tube at the end of Green Park park and head wherever you want to! Good luck!"

You can lie on the grass or stand on the bridge looking towards the London Eye or in the opposite direction, the palace. On either side of it are busy roads but once you're in the centre of the park you no longer hear the traffic.It's 5 minutes walk from Trafalgar Square and 10 minutes from Big Ben and The Houses of Parliament. If you're feeling energetic, there's a great walk through St James's Park then on through Green Park and then Hyde Park to Kensington Gardens. The walk also takes you past the Wellington Memorial arch."

ST James's Park is very large and if you take a quick look at your map you will see a walk up West Carriage Drive will connect you from Knightsbridge to Oxford Street. On the way you can visit The Princess Of Wales Memorial Fountain and Gallery, cross the Serpentine Bridge, seeThe Nursery , break for a nice picnic lunch and then take a path to Speakers Corner on the corner of Marble Arch. Then after seeing this, you are ready for a bit of rough and tumble , achived by walking and shopping in Oxford street LOL. Oxford Street is a long Road so if your feeling tired turn Right down Regent Street see a few more decent shops and then on into Piccadilly, perhaps to see a show orFilm Yeahhh ! A good day out and maybe Dinner to round it Off."

The design of the park is a perfect balance of \"natural\" beauty and showy flower combinations. I'm a gardener from up north in the U.S. and I was so ready to see blooming flowers and perennials coming back. The tulips, primroses, hyacynths and daffodils were spectacular and the vistas picture perfect The swans, ducks and pigeons are quite tame and are easy to see close up. There are many other birds in addition to the pelicans to watch as well. It was wonderful to see so many people enjoying this lovely park -- and it was also wonderful to see that people seemed very careful to keep it neat and tidy -- no litterbugs here!"

Best visited in good weather in the summer, when it's flowerbeds are at their best, it's a very tranquil park with a play area for young children as well as good facilities for older visitors. No visit to London is complete without a visit to this place - it's really superb."

While we did not stay for long, we did walk a good portion of the south side, across one of the bridges and took lots of photos. It was a Thursday evening, so not real busy. Some of the flowers were blooming, and the grass was green, so it looked like spring to me (from Wisconsin). Not too many bikers or joggers, and everyone was polite. Stunning. Thanks for this park."

They ask you how you are, where you are from and give you flowers then aggressively ask for money saying it's childrens day even if it's not. If caught that way, better give some change as they are gypsies and are untouchables here in London. We tried questioning them as a friend was tricked into giving his \u00a35 (he needed change to use the loo) but he got just 50p in return. Plus, we knew it wasn't children's day so I started arguing to get proper change but a crowd started forming around us and we really felt that our lives were in danger and so we let it go. It might be the only way for the gypsies to earn a living but I must admit, it is pretty scary and sad for the tourists at the same time so be careful!"

            "review": "470 years ago. St James's Park is the oldest of the London's eight Royal Parks. It's an oasis of calm in the busy city and is easily accessible from various points of interest.From our hotel on Jermyn Street (The London Cavendish) it's a short walk down Duke street to St James Square then Pall Mall then across The Mall into the glorious green of the park.From Trafalgar Square it's a short walk up The Mall or you can arrive from Horse Guards Parade, Birdcage Walk or Buckingham Palace.Whatever route you take you will enjoy the open space,the pelicans,swans and squirrels .The views from the Blue Bridge are amazing - Big Ben,the London Eye, Buckingham Palace and Horse Guards.While you are sitting taking in the tranquillity just imagine 470 years ago when this area was mainly farmland where pigs would graze. Move forward to 1536 when King Henry VIII created a deer park and built a hunting lodge that is now St James's Palace move forward to 1603 when James the First had the area landscaped and when King Charles II became King in 1660 he had the park made more \"formal\" In 1820 the park had the great makeover we see today. The curving lake, winding paths, the wonderful processional route of the Mall all produced by John Nash and by 1827 it was finished.Hope you enjoy your walk in the park and my little bit of a history lesson !!!"

I truly wish we would have had more time. The kids loved the wildlife - there were so many species of waterfowl, birds, squirrels. The park is well kept, and contains the Princess Diana Memorial Walk. There is a small playground that we did not get to enjoy due to time and weather, but if we go back we will surely stay longer in the green haven in the middle of it all!"

There is a cafe to get refreshments, but I think it could do with some seats/benches for people especially if it;s been raining previously for people to get in the green space for lunch etc. Having said that it is nice to be in a green space after the somewhat busy surrounding area."

I often take the time to wander through this park when walking into the West End from Victoria Station.Terrific lake with all sorts of wildfowl and don't miss the pelicans which are usually at the Horse Guards end. Was lucky once last summer when saw one up close near to the lakeside path.There are well-looked-after flower beds with excellent seasonal displays.There's almost nothing to dislike about this park, the only negative for me being the large, ugly modern caf\u00e9.  Buckingham Palace and the Queen Victoria Memorial are at one end. Horse Guards Parade leading to Whitehall is at the other. The length of The Mall bounds the North side. This place couldn't be more central and is a superb place to unwind for a while during a busy day's sightseeing."

Its position is fantastic with great views of Buckingham Palace and Horseguards Parade but the planting is fantastic especially in the spring and summer at the East side of the park. The lake is also very picturesque and there are plenty of ducks to watch as well as Pelicans! THe cafe is not great and rather expensive though. In the Summer it is a great place to sit and eat a packed lunch along with many office workers."

Originally one of London's lost rivers, the Tyburn flowed through here. James I was the first person to start landscaping the park with ornamental pools and a menagerie of exotic animals and birds. He had an aviary running along what is now Birdcage walk. Charles II replaced the pools with a long straight canal, which in turn was returned back to a more natural lake by George IV. Today the park is still populated by many ducks, swans and other waterfowl. The most famous residents are the pelicans. The views from the bridge in the middle are quite unique, with Buckingham Palace reflected in the lake one side and a couple of fountains up the opposite end. There is a very handy and clean caf\u00e9 and toilet block at the Marlborough entrance to the park on the Mall."

St James is quite a small park but does pack in a lot of fearless wildlife.The biggest attraction to St James is its wildlife. The squirrels are notoriously bold. Ducks and geese are always on the lookout for food. The pelicans though are probably the stars of the show.The park has a stream at its centre, a nice waterway to add backdrop especially with willow trees. A bridge over the stream is impressive because when crossing it there is a direct view to Buckingham Palace as well as towards Horseguards Parade - potentially romantic after dark.There are a few trees in St James but it is mainly open grass. The grass is well maintained through all seasons. The pathways are wide which comes in handy as large tourist groups can block routes quite easily. St James is a nice park but not especially exciting or interesting. There are a couple of attractive angles but its best feature is definitely the location rather than the park itself."

I would probably have to say in my opinion that this is just about the best of the lot with regards to the Central London Parks.Simply because although it's fairly small (just like the neighbouring Green Park), but slightly bigger. With a lovely lake running lake through the centre. Surrounded by lush grenery and beautiful trees on either side. Plus the addition of various species of wildlife. It's no wonder that this particular park seems to get such rave revues (just talk a walk through at some point on your trip to London and you'll see what I mean).With the additional attractions of Buckingham Palace and Horse Guards Parade at either end. Not to mention some of the views. Which should give you some great shots for your cameras.There is also a number of special events that occur throughout the Spring and Summer months it being situated right next to The Mall. So it can often get cordened off at various times.So try not miss this one out on your visit. As I often find it to be quite a well defined sanctuary from the rest of the various tourist spots in the city centre."

There were many beautiful vistas throughout the park that afforded pleasing photo opportunities.The park was clean and well maintained, and we were amused to see stations to store pet waste along the walkways. It appears that pet owners are required to scoop up and deposit any fecal matter that there pets may excrete under penalty of a fine for failure to comply.We watched the ducks, squirrels and pelicans frolic and sometimes beg for treats. They all appeared quite well fed though. We were surprised to see pelicans at such a northern latitude, because in North America we associate pelicans with warmer climates.All in all St. James is a nice place to relax between visits to other nearby attractions such as the Horses at Whitehall and Buckingham Palace to name but a few.t"

We had our then-15 month old with us and it was a perfect amount of downtime after the chaos of dealing with the crowd watching the guard. Watching the squirrels, diverse waterfowl and bird species was great, and the tiny play area was a really nice bonus for our little one. It was so peaceful (though we did see a helicopter land very nearby--but not at the Palace) and wonderful that I had a hard time leaving, but we had so little time to spend in London. I'd absolutely recommend this to any visitor to the city.It was such a perfect time out from the hustle of our trip.Note: These animals are used to being fed. One woman was feeding the swans and a goose was going through her bag, tugging on her pant leg and generally being quite the persistent bird, while three pigeons landed on her and swans circled too! Not something I'd want, but it was hilarious to watch. She was giggling quite a bit herself, too."

But my favorite is St James. Now when I return to visit or work I always stay near St James Place, and then walk south to stroll in St. James Park. I was here last December during an extraordinary cold snap--but bore up under frigid temperatures to visit again. Can't wait to return."

The park is beautifully manicured and has excellent gardens and a lovely fountain. You can walk along the river or just relax and take in the flowers and other plantings. The park has large green spaces, but the inviting canvas chairs are for rent by the hour. We didn't see the small sign with the rental information so our relaxation was interrupted by a young man who informed us that if we wish to continue sitting there we had to pay the fee. We thanked him for letting us know and got up and continued to walk through the park.There are many ducks and pelicans in the water and despite signs, people were actively feeding the fowl. There is also a restaurant and coffee shop in the park near the water where you can have a bite to eat or enjoy a cup of tea on the second level, which has great views of the park.St, James Park is conveniently located across the street from the Horse Guard Palace, just a block off busy Whitehall Street. It is easy walking distance from Westminster and Buckingham Palace. If you walk through the park you can end up right at Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery and avoid the crowds on Whitehall.This is a nice place to spend a short time relaxing, enjoying the gardens and watching all the people visiting the park."

I try to visit St James's Park each time I'm photographing in London, as you come down towards the lake near the little refreshment kiosk, when you turn right and walk around there is some grass on your left behind a little metal fence, the squirrels that play on the grass, in the trees are very friendly and approach you. When I first visited in 2012 It took me by surprise but the squirrel began eating out of a tourists hand. In a way the squirrels themselves to me are an attraction and one of the main reasons I go there. It's a peaceful place to be when there aren't tourists all over the place, but even then, you'll be able to find a quiet corner to sit in and read, relax or do as you please. I highly recommend coming to St James's Park and if you have a camera and some seed, have fun and enjoy the friendly little critters munching seed from your hands!Just take a look at the photos I've attached!"

Terrific for young children to expend their boundless energy. Lots of ducks and swans, and friendly squirrels. Consider bringing a bag of nuts as St James was the only park among the few we went to (Hyde Park, Regent's Park, Hampstead Heath / Parliament Hill) where squirrels would come up close to feed out of your hand. Definitely a highlight for our 3 year olds. They loved it so much we went to St. James's Park twice in the week we were in London to feed the squirrels and play."

There are so many of all those animals that it feels like humans are outnumbered. The little duck house near the fountain is cute, the flower garden in it is beautiful. Overall it's a lovely walk to go over to Buckingham Palace."

If the weather is good you can just wander through the park enjoying looking at the flowers and fountains, and feeding not only the ducks and swans but also the squirrels. The squirrels are very used to people and will come right up to you and feed from your hands. Remember to take some peanuts in or out of shells (no salt) as they love them. They sometimes eat them and come back for more or they'll go and bury them then come back for more. We had them climbing on our knees and into my bag looking for the nuts. They are really cute and quite friendly. Take a packed lunch and a rug and have a picnic and you'll find the squirrels will come over to you to see if you have any nuts for them."

Then you can get back to the tube at the St. James stop, which is located about 2/3 of the way back down the street directly adjacent to the park on the right or walk through Green Park and up the long hill to Green Park Station."

We perked right up, however, when we crossed the Mall, passed through the Marlborough Gate and began to experience the delights of St. James\u2019s Park. By the time we got to the Blue Bridge we were feeling just fine, snapping photos and drawing each other\u2019s attention to various interesting scenes, objects, people, birds, flowers, and what have you. What a wonderful place for a rejuvenating Sunday afternoon stroll!Our cameras got a good workout. The park offers many fine photo ops, of course, but the best ones for my money are the views from the Blue Bridge. If you look east along the lake you'll see Swire Fountain, Duck Island, and the upper half of the London Eye. My wife and I had our picture taken against this backdrop, and it\u2019s one of our favorites. The view along the lake to the west, direction Victoria Memorial and Buckingham Palace, is also dramatic."

Perfect for families, couples and anyone who just wants a time out"

And now I'm able to bring my kids here too, as we visit this lovely city. The squirrels were my chins favourite pastime in London. My chn are squirrel charmers,. With a bag of monkey nuts in hand they could easily spend the whole day in this park feeding the squirrels. A must do for any family with chn."

This is the route of the Changing of the Guards. I was fortunate to catch it on two different occasions - Jul 31 and Aug 21. Both events were a little different but both drew very large crowds (a given in London in August). In Jul I had a chance to walk in the park for a bit. Also walked opposite which is at the rear of St. James Palace. Both the benefit of being with a tour group. I can see why the people of London have enjoy St. James as well as the other city/royal parks for generations. Our hotel in Aug was within walking distance so we were able to walk up there."

The gardens are beautiful, the benches are in the most picturesque spots, you can be in the sun or in the shade, and the views by the shed (duck-keepers quarters, maybe?

The views of Buckingham palace are good. I enjoy sitting in the park at lunch time or after work. It's lovely to have such a green area in Central London. Definitely worth visiting if you're in London and want some relaxation. The inn on the park is good for a drink or a bite to eat but it's expensive for snack food."

St. James' Park is a very nice, quiet, refuge in the middle of London, right beside Buckingham Palace and close to parliament and other attractions. It's a lovely place for a break and to people watch. However, sometimes those people are engaged in some strange activities - unusual choreographed dance movements, lovers who can't afford a room for a couple of hours, and those engaged in activity that can't be described or explained. However, the views of several attractions are outstanding - including very photogenic views across water from the bridge. Birds, animals, flowers, surround you. Just keep an eye open so you don't have to explain to your child \"what that man is doing\"."

Big enough to make you feel like you're not in the middle of a major city, but not so big that it feels endless. The lake has a fountain, and a bridge with nice views. There's tons of birds and ducks, and several squirrels which have clearly been hand fed and were not scared of the people. (I was shocked at how fascinated many visitors were by the squirrels). We walked around the lake and back. The park is very well maintained and manicured. The flowers were pretty and the grass was well kept. (Hyde park was overgrown and not well kept).The park is adjacent to Buckingham Palace, so beware that when the changing of the guard ends, the park is flooded with people leaving.We also stopped at the cafeteria after our walk for a quick bite, and there was outdoor seating to sit and people watch while you enjoyed your food or drink.This was a great free and relaxing attraction to break up the hustle and bustle and expense of the rest of London."

As one would say....\"Stop and smell the flowers\"....for there are plenty in the park! This park is very scenic with walkways that's meander through lush lawns and groves of gorgeous tress. The park has several large ponds or water features that brings calmness to one's day. Stand in the middle of the foot bridge and look one way to see Buckingham Palace and look the other way to see The Eye. Have a picnic lunch in the shade of a big tree or read your favorite book. Great way to spend a few hours!"

However, St. James' Park is more beautiful and has the sense of tranquility compare to other parks of London.

This is a 23 hectare (57 acre) park that is well worth spending some time during visits to London due to its proximity to the palace and other important and interesting attractions in the city as well as the natural beauty of the park itself. We enjoy St. James Park for the lake which splits the park in half, the lovely landscaping and manicured gardens and the birdlife which reside at St. James Lake. During the warmer months, the flower gardens which are found along the north side of the lake are very nice. We have always enjoyed walking across Blue Bridge as well, stopping at the halfway point for the lovely views from here. At the lake, you can see many species of waterfowl, including geese, swans and well as a resident colony of pelicans that can often be seen swimming the lake. Interestingly, the pelicans are supposed to be the descendants of a gift of birds giving by the Russian Ambassador back in the mid 17th century. There are several refreshment points, an Inn in the Park restaurant and plenty of park benches and grass spots for you to take a seat and enjoy your time in St. James Park, particularly during the warmer months of the year. We find the walk along the lake an enjoyable approach to Buckingham Palace, preferring it to the more direct route, The Mall, which serves as the northern boundary of St. James Park. In the end, St. James is very close to interesting and important attractions which makes it quite convenient to visit when spending time in London. It is one of the more attractive Royal Parks, which makes another good reason to spend some time here if you seeking a bit of green space in between your sightseeing efforts."

A lovely lake, plants, gardens, fountains, deck chairs for hire and a fantastic picture opportunity on the bridge to see Buckingham Palace on one side and the London Eye on the other.Walk right up to Buckingham Palace, down the Mall and into Whitehall and you'll get a good feel of the park's vastness and beauty.

My goal was to begin my visit by going to Buckingham Palace first.  I started asking for directions and in the process, got lost several times. During my walks and retracing my walks, I \"found\" St. James Park. I did not know how big it was. I kept walking and walking and felt like I was never getting out of the Park and would not be able to see the Buckingham Palace! What's good is that there are benches in the Park that I could use to rest my tired feet. During these resting periods, I met 3 female strangers who shared with me their London experiences while we were all resting at these benches. Watching the beautiful flowers from these benches is also another benefit of getting lost at St. James' Park. Lessons learned for me: Study the London map. Plan B - if lost, have fun, sit at the bench, watch the people, admire the gardens and other beautiful parts of St. James' Park."

Warm weather and blue skies here elicited a family with children, students and weary tourists. In the park you can rent a deck chair, watching the pond water birds, or just relax with a book tal. Our family has set the local snacks and ice cream are well rested. The park has many statues and rare plants. I recommend everyone to relax while visiting the city."

OK, there are still quite a few people in the park at times, but you can still find a quiet spot for yourself in the sunshine. It is well laid out and of course you get a great photo opportunity from the bridge, with Buckingham Palace in the background. Cafe is always on the busy side, but the staff do well to keep the flow of people served. Only had a coffee take out, so cannot comment on the quality of the service or food. We sat in the sun overlooking the lake for a couple of hours just watching the world go by - Great!"

If you are visiting London and want a break from the shops, traffic and general rush of an international city, then this park is the place for you at any time of the year. Totally relaxing and exceptionally beautiful with flowers, a lake, wildlife and a mixture of locals and tourists all just enjoying taking a little step out of the city's buzz.If you live in London, then incorporating this park into your daily route to and from work is highly recommended.It's a small park so it doesn't take a long time to stroll round but on your way, you will see a wide variety of birds and at this time of year you'll see the most charming baby ducks and swans. There are squirrels scampering all over the park.The park is conveniently situated between a number of tourist attractions such as Buckingham Palace, the Mall, Horse Guards Parade, Trafalgar Square, Downing Street and Parliament Square with Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. It is an easy walk from St James Park or Westminster tube stations.There are ice cream and drinks vendors in the park and a restaurant near to Horse Guards Parade. The public toilets are also at the Horse Guards Parade end of the park. There is a designated childrens play area near to the Buckingham Palace end of the park and a large number of seats throughout the park where you can sit and enjoy the peaceful surroundings."

There are many interesting species of water birds to include my kids favorites, the p\u00e9licans....Note....Heed the signs and don't feed the p\u00e9licans, I tried this once about 7 years ago and they are quite aggressive at trying to get more (even when there isn't any.) Even at 6'5\" I found the beaks of these 4' +birds rather intimidating and little kids that try the same may get injured (though the bite wasn't really strong or hurtful to me). The gardens are set up nicely and I have to say that it's a nice hour or so just getting away from the usual tourist traps. There is also a small restaurant next to the pond that serves the standard overpriced drinks and snakcs (should you so desire)."

Take a bag of nuts (hazelnuts or shelled peanuts are popular) and they'll be eating from your hands.It's a great park for children, and there are plenty of small huts selling snacks, sandwiches and ice creams scattered around.

It was a beautiful summers day & afterwords fancied a walk & St James's Park is right opposite the Palace. This was a perfect ending to an unusual & perfect day. The park holds a lot of history from our Kings & Queens & some rather naughty things happened here in the past, but it was all fun & the gardens are beautiful with a peaceful atmosphere. I have been time & again to this delightful park. Outstanding to say it is in the centre of noisy London."

My only criticism is the lake that copuld do with some rubbish clearing at times, yes I know it is not the park keepers fault but we do live in England where dropping litter appears to be the done thing. The other point about the lake is the management of the bird life, the large collection of ducks and geese appear to be superceded by the ever increasing coot population."

We happened to be at the park during one of the rehearsals for the annual Trooping of the Colour ceremony.

It's a large park but can be made to feel quite small in the summer months with the high number of visitors who like to enjoy its merits, space to sit down and relax can be difficult to locate at times. Why would people want to visit you may wonder. The location of the park itself is perfect. Just yards away are Trafalgar Square, Whitehall, Downing Street, Horseguards Parade, The Mall and of course Buckingham Palace. The park has a variety of resident birds (including Pelicans) and wildlife which are quite tame but not overly so. All in all it's an ideal resting spot on your tourist trail, whichever way you're heading."

St. James's Park is ideally located between the Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, so you are very likely to walk through it at one stage of your visit. It truly is a great place to relax, have a snack or a picnic, sit on one of the wooden benches and observe the ducks and geese (and pelicans, if you are lucky!), take some great nature shots... Make sure you go over the Blue Bridge for some fantastic views of the Buckingham Palace and the London Eye. It is definitely worth a visit!"

Added to the multiple faces of London there is the luxury of having a substantial amount of enjoyable large and small parks. These parks can't be given over to office block developers, thank God, because most of the major parks are owned by the Royal Family. St. James's park is situated between Buckingham Palace and Whitehall. One of the nice features of this park is the large elongated water area, where many species of fowl, water birds, etc live. The path along this water area is studded with wooden benches, where you can relax, watch the birds, watch the tourists, eat a sandwich and generally have an enjoyable time, even more when the weather is clement. Furthermore, some years ago an eatery was built in the park, called appropriately \"Inn the Park\", which pride itself on the environmental rapport of the eatery with the surroundings. Apart from having good bathroom facilities, in my personal view this eatery is overpriced and uninviting. When you start at the Buckingham Palace end you emerge from the park probably at the back of the Horse Guard Parade."

If you're coming here, be sure to bring a camera and spend at least 30 minutes to appreciate the beautiful park. Children especially will very much enjoy it here. There are squirrels, ducks, pelicans and other kinds of birds in the park . No eagles or ostriches though, in case you're wondering :)It's a park, I can't say much about it, but you have to go there to see why everyone goes there. If you fancy sunbathing, doable. Maybe not in winter or late autumn I guess?Many other must-go places in London is walkable from here like Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square. So if you're travelling by public transport, worry not about how to get to these other places, just get a map and buy comfortable walking shoes."

It just so happens most of those sights are all within close vicinity of one another. Eye, Big Ben, House of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, etc. With all the tourists and locals around it was what I would assume a typical busy London day. On the way to one of our destinations, the route led us through here: St. James Park. Despite being in the middle of the busy London areas it was relatively quiet. It was very clean and very green. The park definitely looked well maintained. It was a nice stroll and a good change from seeing all the buildings around the area. If your time in London is limited, this attraction is not necessarily a must see, but if your strolling around the area with time to spare, cut through the park instead if you can to your next destination."

It's been a firm favourite since I first visited London as a child, then became a Londoner and now more of a visitor. So it's a decades long luv-affair. It's a happy place. The gardens no matter the season are beautiful - from the crisp'ness and snow of winter and seeing pelicans in the snow ... to burst of spring, daffodils and blossom on the trees, to the summer with riots of colour and, in autumn, the beautiful hues of the trees. The lake is a bird haven.in all all... A real treasure.Events too ... Concerts in the park in summer are fun and full of relaxation and the bird life adds to the fun times. From age of 5 to hopefully when I am a 100, St James' is simply great.And the ease of access - it's a super meeting point - as the palaces of Buckingham and St James' are nearby as are the Houses of Parliament. So this is \"a must do and enjoy\"."

My advice is to leave the footpath and go for a walk in the trees. You get a whole different perspective of the park and the squirrels come bounding up to you looking for nuts - superb."

There is a waterway down the middle and birds of all kinds, including swans, several ducks with their baby birds in a row. They are quite used to people so my daughter was able to take some great photographs of baby birds etc which she loved. We often stopped to look at the wildlife and the flowers. Very relaxing.

You can see The London Eye in the distance, and you can get some great photos.These wonderful green spaces within the Capital are so very special and such a break from the hustle of the City.My advice is to try and visit this park and enjoy all that it has to offer."

From Big Ben, London Eye and Westminster Abbey and en-route to Buckingham Palace, its a great place to sit and watch the birds, squirrels and people of London while recharging the batteries. The gardens, flower beds and trees are beautiful and a break from all of the man-made attractions. The air even feels cooler and cleaner in here. Also a good place to let the kids of the leash for while because you cant let them run around London so a good place fro them to play and let off some steam."

While the park was well attended at the time, it was relaxing and very enjoyable. Some people were sitting on chairs or on the grass, many were simply walking and enjoying the great variety of birds and animals. I was surprised to even see a lad feeding a squirrel right off his hands.The park has many paths you can choose to take; a lovely lake with different geese and ducks; and it is across from Buckingham Palace, which makes the experience ever so memorable. You can walk to the Horses Guard and on to Trafalgar Square at the end of your visit. It is definitely one of my favourite parks in London."

You can stroll avond for an hour or two, take this little path, than that, looking at the swans and ducks, trying to imagine if you could maybe plant those flowers in your garden.

Every time I come I love to walk from Green Park through St James park and on through Hyde and Kensington Parks. I love that it is so well used by people and their dogs. The birds are a treat and many that we saw nesting when here in May we now saw with their broods. I was a biologist in my life before medicine and spent several summers studying American Coots in BC and love watching the coots here feeding their young 'Humphries'. It is lovely to see how well used it is by Londoners and travelers alike. St James in particular has lovely signs up explaining the different bird species. It is also amazing how just steps from the hustle and bustle of the square by Buckingham Palace you can be in the relative solitude of the parks. They have beautiful perennial gardens that were in full bloom this time. The only negative is some of the garbage in the park waters ....perhaps jail time for the polluters would solve the problem!!!! Always amazes me that people would just throw bottles in the water. More garbage cans might help and more frequent pickup might also help as some were overflowing ....so at least some people try but I suppose there will still be polluting pigs.....amazing that people can defile such a lovely place."

Despite having lived in London for a couple of years, I had never been to the Park. I mentioned my visit to the Park to my aunt who has lived in London for over 50 years, and she said that she had never been there. The main attraction for me was the unexpected sight of the magnificent pelicans. They were first introduced into the Park in 1664, and currently there are six of them, including three Great White Pelicans which were a gift given this year by the City of Prague."

There are organised walkways and places to buy food if you need to. The lake in the centre is large and is occupied by a family of pelicans towards the end. Buckingham Palace is at one end and Horse Guards Parade at the other. The park does get busy especially on nice days as workers in the area sit and eat their lunches on the benches. Quite a pleasant atmosphere considering you are in the centre of London."

The centerpiece of the park is a lake that is home to many different kinds of birds, including swans, ducks, geese, and pelicans. The gardens are beautifully landscaped with flowers and flowering bushes in a very natural way. Sure you could just walk briskly through on your way from one tourist location to another ... but why not take your morning coffee or lunch and sit on a bench in St James Park. You'll be glad you did!"

Like all parks we visited in London, the lake area offers a nice place to walk, relax, and spot birds. We happened to stumble upon two beautiful storks sunning themselves on the large boulders inside the lake. Amazing! Even in a large city like London, the huge parks offer some great green spaces to have a quiet moment."

Today the park offers a truly beautiful environment for visitors of all ages. The lake is impressive and there are fantastic views from the bridge across the lake looking towards Whitehall. The view is reminiscent of Camelot! The park is maintained to a high standard with beautiful flower beds, green lawns and well-maintained paths bordering the lake. Look out for a wide range of domesticated and wild ducks/geese on the lake. Children will enjoy feeding the ducks on the Pall Mall (north) side of the park towards Whitehall. Text panels mounted around the lake assist visitors with the identification of the ducks that can be seen on the lake. Deck chairs are available during the summer months. There are catering facilities within the park ranging from a proper cafe to a waffle stall. Be warned that the park gets especially busy during the Spring and Summer immediately following the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace. A great place to 'chill out', admire some beautiful views and plants and generally watch the world go by. There is a playground for children at the Buckingham Palace end of the park."

St. James Park is on the walking tours in the Westminster/White Hall area and is easy to find. If you\u2019ve just toured Westminster Abbey, go North past Methodist Central Hall. When you come to the name of a street you\u2019ll never forget (Birdcage Walk), take a left. The park will be on your right, but keep walking to one of the main entrances where a large map of the park is located. St. James Park is a real respite from city life. It\u2019s not a formal garden but it\u2019s the perfect answer if you\u2019ve been around a lot of concrete and steel and need a break. There are many paths that criss-cross through the park, and you can also make a circle around the lake. You can even see Buckingham Palace past the far end of the lake. You can stay for as long or as short as you would like (with no charge), but it took some perseverance to move on to more sights, as May is a time of exquisite colors and green, green grass in the park."

We visited London to see a show on the Saturday night (Tailor Made Man) and decided to walk through St James's Park on the Sunday morning on our way from the hotel to the coach station. The day was not the best weather and in that muddy unattractive time just before Spring really kicks in so probably not seen at its best. However, it was pleasant enough due to the wildlife that lives there. We saw numerous birds including a heron and loads of tame squirrels that were eating out of people's hands. We also saw some interesting wildlife in the form of a runner who decided to do pressups with his feet on a bench - funny as only his head was going up and down not his torso! We finished by Buck House end and that's always good to see on a trip to London. Would we rush back - no, but it made a necessary walk more pleasant."

There is a small playpark for kids at the end near the palace. Take a walk around the lake - look at the peclicans. If you're sat down quite often you can end up being pestered by squirrels. A good rest stop between the Buckingham Palace and Houses of Parliament/Westminster Abbey/War Rooms, worth the walk from Trafalgar Square through Admiralty Arch."

So, get off the tube at Parliament, check out Big Ben, the Abbey, and Downing Street, before heading through Horse Guards Parade and through St James Park to Buckingham Palace.

It has a lovely cafe in the centre of the park and some lovely ponds and a lovely bridge over the ponds that has a great view of the London Eye. You'll enjoy it."

Even better, take a packet of almonds and feed the squirrels, they will run up your leg and along your arm and sit in your hand while they eat a nut. It is fascinating for children and adults alike. At one end sits Buckingham Palace and the other the Cabinet War Rooms and Horseguards Parade. Along the sides are Birdcage Walk and Pall Mall - the park is something not to be missed. There is plenty of bird life also and with a few crumbs you can become \"bird man\" and literally have the pidgeons eating out of your hands. Close by is also the Guards Museum which is certainly worth a visit."

I love St. James\u2019s Park.The oldest of the London parks, it is bordered by the Mall, Horse Guards Parade, Birdcage Walk and Buckingham Palace, all of which were extensively filmed during the Olympics. It is steeped in tradition and history: coronations, weddings, funerals, parades of all kinds, street theatre, daily glimpses of the Guards or Household Cavalry on ceremonial duty, all these have taken place around it. Statues and memorials abound. Equally iconic are Duck Island Cottage with its vegetable garden; the Blue Bridge across the lake, which has featured in so many films, including 101 Dalmatians; and the summer Bandstand. But it is the passing of the seasons in the peaceful, immaculately kept gardens that brings me back whenever I can. At the moment though, parts of the park are still recovering after the removal of all the temporary Olympic structures The pelicans are great favourites. There have been pelicans in the park since the Russian ambassador presented a pair to King Charles II in 1664. However, they were banned for a short interlude for eating the pigeons! You should not feed them, they are given plenty of fish every day. And take care if you come across one wandering around, they won\u2019t hurt you but can become frightened if surrounded.If you take the time, you will see a large variety of birds and animals, including tame squirrels and wild foxes, living or passing through the park. Feeding the birds is a favourite pastime for many. White bread is discouraged but according to one of the Park keepers you can \u201cFeed swans lettuce - they really like it.\u201d"

As soon as I got past the fence I was entranced by the greenery and how lush all the trees looked. It was a perfect day as well: chilly around 60F but very sunny, so the light was amazing. There were plenty of people and wildlife about as well, so there was a lively atmosphere. As recommended by others, the footbridge was a great spot to see both the Palace and the buildings by the Thames, all surrounded by gorgeous trees. Being a Downton Abbey fan, I remembered seeing two of the characters walking down a lakeside path in this park, and I ended up finding that very spot during my visit. Despite the cold, it was a very lovely diversion in the middle of my mad schedule, and I found it just as beautiful (if not more so) than the other two Royal Parks surrounding Buckingham Palace."

Beware, however, the squirrel gang that occupies the area about 100 yards in. They are bold little creatures that will come right up to you for food. I say 'beware' jokingly as they were adorable. Even if you do not look like you have something, they come within a couple feet and wait for you to give them something to munch. Take a few nuts in your pocket.

A small area of the park was under construction while we were there, but it hardly made a difference due to the large size of the park. It is quite clean with long and winding paths, plenty of benches, the ability to rent lounge/sun chairs. They also have refreshments available (Sodas, water, coffee/tea, candy, ice cream, crisps, etc) and also a sit-down restaurant within the park. As others have mentioned, the wildlife is very friendly and the squirrels will eat from your hand. I recommend bringing nuts if you would like to partake in this (walnuts in-shell are best). I suggest this as a great place to bring a blanket and picnic on a nice day."

It was nice and relaxed & great to see familys out & workers obviously on their lunch breaks. The lake was nice as was the cute little gardeners cottage. & I loved the squirrels! We dont have them in NZ so it was a real novelty for me to see them there."

You have Buckingham Palace at one end of course, and at the other the back of the buildings which face Whitehall, including Downing Street. One side has The Mall leading down to Admiralty Arch, and the other side is Birdcage Walk which leads to Victoria. Horse Guards regularly leave the Palace for the barracks in Birdcage Walk and can be viewed from St James' Park, usually at 11am I believe, but best check that. You can hire deckchairs in the park and there is a small food stall, although I haven't tried it. Ducks, geese and squirrels a plenty. In the summer it is gorgeous."

I am staying with my son at Waterloo, in London and decided to make good use of a spell of sunny weather in the morning on saturday, and wander off to a nearby English park. Friendly tube station attendants, Bobbies and Paralympics venue staff, pointed me in the right direction and soon I was following mobs of tourists as they too made their way into the area. Once inside St James's Park I was struck by the wonderful landscaping, the pretty flower beds and the Tiffany fountains, the fat pelicans, inquisitive moorhens and host of other waterbirds and umpteen squirrels that seemed so comfortable amid the throngs of visitors. The golden cherubs atop the statue outside Buckingham Palace peeked through a shroud of trees ..... managed to get some nice pictures too.Although there was a bit of jostling in some of the areas, on account of it being peak season, the park did seem to be big enough for everyone, even though one part was blocked off for the Paralympics event related arrangements. I had a lovely time exploring the park. Next time I will go with a sandwich and a flask of coffee and sit on one of those easy chairs and do my sudoku/crossword.Got a glimpse of a Canadian women's team going off somewhere to practice for the paralympics too!"

I work just a few minutes from St James's Park and often find myself walking around there of a lunchtime throughout the year.The views of Buckingham Palace are wonderful and there is plenty to see around the park too. I often take monkey nuts with me and the squirrels will gently take them from your hand (or run up your leg and sit on your shoulder).I enjoy coming here all year round just to observe the colours of the season and get a little 'me time' from my usually busy days in the office."

It's very close, and the Changing of the Guard pretty much goes right by. The park is well cared for, with ponds, swans, flowers, and is a good stroll. It also connects to Green Park (free chairs on the lawn for tired souls), and can get you a good distance away from cars and noise."

Coming back from houses of Parliament we had our route planned back to our hotel on google map but found St James park blocked off all around the park and all the entrances but one blocked off with no signs or directions for altertnative routes and got into a panic as it was pitch black. Got in one entrance but then couldnt get out. Even the staff at the entrances didnt know where we should go. A 10 minute walk took 50 minutes and we were exhausted! spoilt what had been a perfect day sightseeing and was annoying as we had made our plans so carefully. I understand that this is due to paralympics but still signs (which are lit up) should warn you as you approach so u do not waste your time and end up going to far to be able to turn back! Especially when its dark (well it was pretty dark at 8.40 when we started but very dark by the time we found a way out at Buckingham Palace. So much for our short cut!) ! Hotel told us many people at the hotel had the same problem :("

We were enthralled by the squirrels who hold their food in their front paws and sit up on their hind legs - they came so close to us and we took many photos, as we do not have these at home and we found them to be charming creatures. Try to stop in here on the way back from viewing the Change at Buckingham Palace - if it has been crowded there and you have been jammed in amongst hundreds of people for the best part of an hour or two, then you will welcome a spot of relaxation and breathing space in St James Park."

Beautiful flowers and trees blooming everywhere, very relaxing in the middle of the city. Park is probably even better, but much of it was blocked off for Olympic events preparation, thinking they do volleyball and some running events start here. Use it as a good rest/break area during your sightseeing around London, easy walk from Westminster, Buckingham, London eye, etc."

However the park itself it beautiful with many great photo opportunities, or simply just to sit down and enjoy. The squirrels are always there and are not put off by tourists getting close to take photos. The hot chocolate was still good, but not as great as previously, maybe it needs to be colder to fast better!

It is easy to take it for granted. Surely the views from the pedestrian bridge are some of the best in London? Tourists seem to agree, this must be one of the most photographed sites in London. The park has been allowed to grow slightly wilder in discrete parts around the lake especially, presumably to encourage wildlife which certainly on a recent visit seemed to be thriving. There has also been more focus on eating facilities and, unusually for London, there are free toilets.It is a small and relatively compact park, but with plenty of variety, and beautifully kept. It deserves its high level of recommendations."

But you can often find a little bit of green to sit a while and relax, and if you are a squirrel feeder like we are, you will often find the furry friends come to you easily enough. There is a good supply of water fowl available for watching, including some swans (a black one, if you can find him). Spring is a delightful time when the flowers are in bloom and the birds are nesting, but beware of middle months of 2012: with the Queen's Jubilee and the Olympics on their way, even this little oasis is likely to be gone."

The gardens in St James are beautiful and well maintained and the waterway is a delight with lots of wildlife and many nesting birds. We really appreciated the signs that indicated what birds were what. The whole walk through the gardens on the way to see Buckingham palace was a delight and given the time of year not crowded at all. We were very pleased to see that the area seems to also be used well by locals."

A lung and oasis in central London, St James's Park is one of the Royal Parks, it was laid out to give the residents of Buckingham Palace a half way decent view and somewhere to go hunting. It is also a very pleasant short cut from Victoria Street to Whitehall and Trafalgar Square.The Park is used extensively in the summer by the civil servants who work in nearby Whitehall and Westminster. It is also rightly poplar with tourists. There are trees aplenty and wildlife, including squirrels, albeit grey tree rats rather than the indigenous red ones.The park boasts a network of lakes, which attract many different species of birds. Others are maintained there. You will find helpful guidance notes posted about the place.On that, I should sound a warning, the pelicans have been known to gobble up smaller birds, which some youngsters might not understand and might thus find distressing.There is a cafe/shop but I've not eaten there so can't report reliably."

The pond is the heaven for many species of ducks and gooses. Visit the park early in the morning if you want to be ''almost'' alone. Afterwards you may experience the invasion of tourists. The Pelicans are quite impressive. Information about the wild fowl is clearly given. For children, it's a wonderful experience to feed the ducks by hand. The squirrels come to eat in your hand. The park is located near many spots of interest including the Horse Guards.The only drawback ... the number of tourists! But, I was one of them."

The park is well maintained, and the flower boarders are updated regularly. For me as a commuter the only frustration was the number of people taking photos of friends on the bridge. Am sure I must be in some of those photos! For this reasoning would avoid going to the park at peak times. The view from the bridge on a crisp sunny winters day is wonderful. There is a restaurant in the park which is ok but quite pricey for what it is. There are lots of squirrels and pigeons, remember to take some monkey nuts for the squirrels if you want to capture a close up picture. If you are in the park at the right time of year you might be lucky enough to see the swans and their singlets or the little ducklings which are so cute. There are a few pelicans but they spend a lot of time on a little island on the lake - if you do see them you mustn't feed them ( or you could end up at the Tower!)"

There are a couple of eating places which are quite expensive and always busy. I have never ate in these so I cannot comment on quality. If you stroll across the Mall you can see the Queens Guard on duty outside of St James Palace. This is most probably the best place to get a good picture. If you time this with the change over, once completed ask the policeman on duty if you can stand next to one of the guards and have your picture taken. My son is a guard and this has happened a few times to him."

Kind of a limited selection and the service was painfully slow, but there is a patio that looks over the water and is quite nice. Lots of people come to the park to picnic and that's what we'll do next time. Lots of different waterfowl to see while you're there - including some unusual white pelicans. Check the park's web site to see what time the park rangers feed them. Overall, we love St. James's park and can't wait to go back."

We fed them and the squirrels all of whom were friendly. We had only had a small breakfast so were delighted to come across a hut selling hotdogs in ciabatta and Belgian waffles. A coffee, a coke, a hotdog and two waffles, one with chocolate sauce came to only a tenner, pretty amazing for the centre of London I though, albeit in a park. With a wee seating area, we settle in for a while. The tables weren't clean but I suppose that is to be expected whilst outdoors and surrounded by animals! My daughter followed a wee mouse, saying how cute it was whilst we were seated and I was dubious, as mice get scared easily; imagine my surprise when I peeked down to see a rat staring at me! Aaargh! But hey, there are rats in the world, just be careful when your daughter tries to feed a 'mouse' with a bit of bread though!!The walk takes you straight up to Buckingham Palace; I can't imagine a better route. Maps along the way are clear and let you know where everything is. The area overall is very clean and well looked after and we could have spent all afternoon there, if we'd had more time. Definitely worth a wander.If we'd had the chance to hire the Barclay Bikes (bikes for hire around London, very cheap indeed and such a great idea starting at \u00a31 an hour or even 30 minutes for free! Credit or debit card required though) then St James Park would have been the ideal location to try them out."

The park was home to many creatures so we had a great time snapping pictures of various birds/swans/etc. They would literally flock by the pond and just stay there until someone walked by. And I'm not talking about just one or two tiny pigeons. These birds/ducks/what not would come in hordes!!! Very entertaining!!All in all, a must see. There were so many great things about this park.

I love walking through and having breakfast at the restaurant in the park, enjoying the swans, dodging the runners when there are races and using it to go from the St. James area where I often stay to other parts of the city. Prefer it to the larger parks but i think everyone in London prefers the parks that they live near or use daily.It is a wonderful place to take a stroll no matter whom you are spending the day. Beautiful, pristine and not overwhelming."

I/we like the bridge over the lake as part of a longer north-south walking route between Westminster and Green Park (tubes: walking between St James's station to Green Park station). Equally easily you can slip into it from the back of Whitehall, Trafalgar Square or at the other end, from Buckingham Palace and Victoria station areas. Summertime band concerts are worth seeking out. The in-park catering is less to write home about in my opinion but then everyone buys sandwiches/picnics from the shops that line Victoria St to the south or Trafalgar Sq areas to the north. Enjoy the bird life. Don't expect a park bench seat between 12-2 in the summer!"

But my favourite thing about coming here is feeding the squirrels. If you're a tourist, and come from a place where squirrels are not common, do yourself a favour and take a small bag of nuts along -- the squirrels will come right up to you and take the nuts from your hands.

It great to walk around in your lunchbreak, walking around the lakes seeing the different wildfowl and also the antics of the squirrels who are so tame they actually climb up onto you if you have their favourite monkey nuts, its fun sweeing them hunting in the flower beds for their stash. large cafe and also smaller kiosks dotted around. Horseguards at one end, BuckHouse at the other, or just sit back and relax."

There are places to eat or just have a coffee and its a perfect oasis to soak up the beauty in the middle of a generally traffic ladened city.Though not enormous it is definitely my favourite London park."

Its a superb park, very close to Buckimgham palace & Churchill war rooms. In fact, you get very nice views of the palace & the London eye from some spots.The views from 'The Blue Bridge' were fabulous, the pelicans are a major attraction in the park.Don't miss the Horseguard's parade nearby, get a view of the Royal London. Luckily there was a bright sunshine when I went so it was a marvellous day out..."

Best moment for me.. I cant help it, im an animal lover! Remember follow the rules, don't overfeed the animals! And respect the nature, dont go over the fence on the water side. good TIP : take the bus or underground to Green Park or Buckingham Palace, then walk from the palace in to St. James Park, walk across the park and you are in City of Westminster where u can experience Big Ben and over the bridge; London Eye! That is a little walk of 20 min or so and a lot of sights!!!!"

It's a nice park for people watching, feeding the ducks, and watching people get amazingly close to the park squirrels. I didn't like the fact that London had put out sling chairs for the summer but they were for rent and a park employee comes by to make sure you've paid or else you have to get off the chairs. We didn't have our lunch with us so our hunger drove us to eat at the INN at the PARK outdoor grill area. We had their burger and though it was good, it wasn't really worth the price. Better to pick up your lunch at PRET A MANGER quick sandwich shop and bring it with you to the park for an impromptu picnic. Kids would love this park because they can be free to run around in all the green space. My 4 teenage girls loved it because we just relaxed after having traveled in to London from Paris that morning."

For anyone visiting London and intending to replicate the route taken during the Royal Wedding or anyone simply visiting Buckingham Palace, St. James Park lies along The Mall (the road that connects Piccadilly with Buckingham Palace). The Park is small but picturesque in nature and houses a host of wildlife including pelicans and squirrels. A lot of the wildlife is extremely friendly and the park is a great place to stop to enjoy a stroll or a sandwich or just to admire the flowers and the wildlife."

When you see clips in a movie of a London park this (aside from Hyde Park) is what you expect...the pond with the willows hanging down, green plants, vibrant flowers, and right at the doorsteps of Buckingham Palace. Locals and visitors alike are all around this park which lends to a really comfortable atmosphere."

Terrific park; easy to navigate; stunning views across lakes to Buckingham Palace and the towers of Whitehall and yet this is basically slap bang in the middle of London. Safe, walkable, flat, open, trees, nature, water. I can see why the Queen lives where she does, she gets to to open \"one's curtains\" and look out onto this every day. Nice to walk in the morning from Buckingham Palace through the park towards Whitehall, but remember to turn around every now and then to get the views back to the palace. the views towards the buildings on Whitehall (The Household Cavalry) are maybe even more stunning, which is why I would rather go this direction.Easy to access from the main Victoria station. Bit crazy when the Changing of the Guards is on at Buckingham Palace. But note there is the less visited Changing of the Guards at the Cavalry too; Horse Guards Parade.Worth going if this is your 1st visit or your 100th visit."

Not only is the park beautiful, but I had an experience there which reinforced to me the kindness and welcoming of Londoners. The park is simply spectacular with so much to see, and comfy benches to sit while relaxing or nice tracks for walking. One can see wildlife, flowers, and even views of The London Eye and Buckingham Palace. Even though it was raining, the beauty was majestic. The lake was partially frozen, and the birds were walking on the water --we called them \"Jesus Birds\" :=) On the second visit, the weather was wonderful--no rain! After walking the park again, we headed out over the bridge, and there was a local gentleman feeding the squirrels. I commented on it and took some photos, and the lovely man heard me. He motioned to me then smiled and pulled me over, handed me some peanuts and showed me how to feed the squirrels and the birds! I was a bit scared (silly, I know) so I said \"nooo it's OK\" but he wasn't having any of that. :=)I took the peanuts and decided to get over my fear of wild squirrels, lol. I was so nervous that I dropped the nuts, but he reassured me that they wouldn't bite me, and sure enough they didn't. They nibbled from my hands and one even \"tapped\" me on the leg as if to say \"hey, I want some, too!\" They weren't pestering at all; they knew just when to back off and were so adorable. It was easy to see that the gentleman was a frequent visitor, and had quite a rapport with the squirrels and birds. It was an amazing experience and I'll never forget his kindness. To me, it just added to the beauty of the park -- wilderness and nature in the middle of a city."

I spent hours relaxing on a blanket and watching the world go by, literally! People from every culture, country, walk of life, etc. visit this park, which in my opinion, is extremely cool! I am not a lay back and chill traveler. I like the flow of a busy city and I like to be on the move...however, once I entered this place, I instantly switched over to 'chill mode.' It was an unforgettable experience. And I personally reccommend taking a whole day, with a picnic basket.....it was well worth it!"

It is very central to Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben and others. I have been here so many times before but I forgot how beautiful this park becomes in the springtime. All the Cherry trees are in bloom and the place is awash with colour. I always feel safe wandering around too as it is usually very busy with people and all of it is fairly open plan. All the birds and ducks are out and about and this place really has something for everyone. I got great photographs and have now got some extra great memories too."

The main features are a lake which has a large collection of ducks and geese and others birds including pelicans. During spring and summer the flower beds are absolutely stunning with large swathes of colour. The parks also has a cafe where you can but food and drink or there are a number of smaller vendors which sell snacks. As I am a resident I have not used either of these facilities so I cannot help advice on price or quality. The parks is very near Buckingham Palace which means at lunch times you can also get to see the changing of the guards which normaly march past the park along The Mall.And finally, there are the squirrels. If you have a tasty nut and a bit of patience they will feed from your hand."
