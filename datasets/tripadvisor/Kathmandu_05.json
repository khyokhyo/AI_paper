Our guide was nice and knowledgeable. The night before the trip they came to our hotel because we couldn't make it to their offices. Definitely would recommend using Outfitter Nepal!For those who wanted to do this particular trip, it took us a bit more than 4 hours to hike to Changunarayan, 20-30 minutes of which was higher intensity. We needed a lot of layers - the morning was very cold and the afternoon was very warm. Bring meds if you get car sick, too :)"

It was a fabulous 12 day tour and our trekking in the mountains was fabulous and so beautiful. I could not speak highly enough of the Outfitter Company they made us so welcome and a big thank you to our guide Bishnu and our porter Bim. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone who likes walking in higher altitude/mountains and seeing the true beauty of Nepal in the Annapurna mountains."

I spoke to a few other companies that I didn't have a great vibe with. Fortunately for me, I stumbled across Outfitter Nepal and they provided all the information I needed and more.I meticulously asked NG everything, and he answered all my questions and remedied all my concerns about the Trek. I also explained to them my low budget situation, and they made adjustments where they could to accommodate me and make the trip affordable. I had a wonderful group of people, excellent guides, and an unforgettable experience that to me was once in a life time."

Before beginning I had dreamed of reaching EBC. My journey couldn't have been better. I travelled to Nepal alone and met the group I was matched with which was 14people, 2 exceptional guides Hom and Dhana. Little did I know that I would gain a whole new family through the trek. Outfitter Nepal made me and my friends feel at home from day one. Hom and Dhana went out of their way to make it a trek of a lifetime. I would highly recommend outfitter Nepal to everyone. They have treks to suit all levels of fitness and adventure levels. I cannot begin to thank you all enough for this trip. I hope to visit again soon and complete another epic trek. 5star for all aspects of this trip."

We visited Durbar square, which was unfortunately severely damaged by the earthquake last year. Nevertheless, it was still interesting to look at the remains of these ancient buildings and hear about the history. We also visited the Monkey temple, Pashupatinath temple and Baudanath Stupa, all of which are unscathed after the earthquake. The traffic in Kathmandu is absolutely crazy, but we had a good driver. All the history and facts are quite overwhelming and I would recommend doing some reading before hand. We had an interesting day."

It's taken me a little while to write a review, Outfitters started well, although we had a slight hiccup at the airport in having to get ourselves on the plane and off to Luckla, but once on the trek all was going pretty well. Raj and Sunil were both excellent, very supportive and good blokes. Our journey to EBC ended at Dughla at lunchtime on the 25th when the earthquake struck. Although the we were at altitude, cold and a long way from home Raj, Sunil and our wonderful porters looked after us, kept us moving, safe and eventually got us to Lobouche for a very cold and scary night. They safely led us back to Luckla, finding safe accommodation and safe paths on the damaged track. At a time of a devasting national disaster the Outfitters team got us to places in between consistent tremors up to 6.7 ! It was sad, unbelievable, tragic and still immensely beautiful. The people of Nepal are the strongest and kindest. I sincerely thank Outfitters and the team on our trek who looked after us and cared for us when we were in extreme danger. To think of us when we know their families were in very sad situations was incredibly overwhelming. I will be back, I think we have about 8 kilometres to go to finish off from where we got to, my bucket list is not complete and I want to see Nepal and the magnificent Nepalese again, my best regards and sincere thanks to the Outfitters team. This trek was not what we expected but at a time when in the worst of situations the best in people come out, and to Raj, Sunil and the team, Namaste, your are the Best."

My brother and I did a 14 day Everest Base Camp trek with Outfitter Nepal in November/ December 2015 and we absolutely loved it! From first emailing the company, to meeting Raj (our main guide) at the airport, to the preliminary meetings and the actual trek, Outfitter Nepal personnel were very professional and friendly, helping make our trip as stress free and enjoyable as possible. The guides kept us motivated throughout the trip and were careful to make sure that we all walked at our own paces and were well hydrated throughout. The Outfitter Nepal crew were a breeze to work with and really did treat us like part of an extended family which we were very appreciative of. I highly recommend visiting Nepal and using the services of Outfitter Nepal, especially if you want to go trekking. In the aftermath of the earthquake and fuel crisis the country needs tourist dollars more than ever and where else could your money be better spent than with a local company that puts the profits back into the community!"

This was an excellent route for people of various fitness levels and our guide from Outfitters was fantastic! He was extremely experienced and knowledgable. Our porter who was young and at the beginning of his career was so enthusiastic and knowledgable already that he was pretty much a second guide. He was caring and took his time to walk slower patiently with my mother.Secondly, I did the Langtang route, which was just fantastic. I was a single female travelling alone with one guide and felt safe, secure and comfortable at all times. My guide who was friendly and chatty was able to tell me a lot about Nepalese culture on a personal level as well as being an extremely professional and experienced trekking guide.I simply can't recommend Outfitter Nepal enough. They go one step further in every way to ensure you have a fantastic experience."

Outfitter Nepal was so kind to follow up with a reminder. And good thing they did - otherwise I'd have regretted not doing this trek. Service doesn't stop there - You will be picked up from Tribhuvan Airport to your hotel, adequate briefings given on what to expect for the trek, & during the trek itself, adequate staff will be on hand to cover the lead group, as well as to sweep the rear. This is quality service with an emphasis on YOUR experience! And since we were back in Kathmandu for New Year's eve, we got to dine & party with the Outfitter Nepal guys. Great bunch!"

            "review": "Base camp of Everest tour. I booked this trip with a friend through scoopon during February.Seems a lot of Australians took advantage of this deal.I'll try and quickly sum up the tour in pros and cons; I covered accommodation through my review of moonlight hotel who were the preferred place to stay by outfitter Nepal. Pros;- much cheaper than most tours under the same umbrella. This is the biggest pro with other competitors asking for 2500 AUD for the same tour.- experience through the tour provided the best chances for reaching base camp.- it's not so overly risk averse that you can do most things at your own pace and also have some real adventure.- with reduced numbers of tourists in the aftermath of the earthquake has made the track much user friendly with no hold ups in areas such as the suspension bridges, which also leaves more abilities in top areas for crowded free photos. This also gives the tourist more ability in negotiating prices when shopping.- our guide Hom was extremely patient and friendly throughout some extraordinary circumstances with clients sometimes acting up outside what would be \"normal\" sensible requests.- the sleeping bag provided was extremely good, warm and clean. I wouldn't take one if your okay with using another sleeping bagCons;- the current fuel crisis is causing difficulties in many areas including restaurants for example now stating \" gas free\" menus.- when arriving at the airport for the fly out to Lukla try and have your bags weighed individually on scales before checking in or have that done when actually checking in. 15 kilos combined hand luggage and checked in bags is the limit per person.Other fellow travellers might not be so rigorous when packing to the 15 kilo limit. We ended up around 20 kilos above the limit with only 7 in our party? So the costs was shared - my friend and I ensured we were below the limit excluding items that would have been nice during the walk. Recommend wearing a few sets of clothes on the plane - heavy jackets carry with you for the flight.Things to bring - just a short list.Diamox - above 2700 metres. Can't believe how many people got altitude sickness and waited until after the symptoms had struck them. Improve your chances - take them as prescribed.Aquatabs (water purification) will save you money. The last place Gorekshep is the only place where you must buy bottled water. They get their water from a muddy glacier puddle where all the livestock drink from.Take a water bladder as it's easier to sip as you walk along.A good wind breaker - imperative. Saved my bacon on the Pumori base camp hike. Minus 10 and then add the wind chill!!!!!Hiking boots aren't really that necessary when I was there. Hybrid shoes would have been far more comfortable. However I had no snow on my hike. An extra pair of lightweight comfortable shoes would have been beneficial for around the tea houses.Additional items;Ask for an additional blanket at tea houses before sleep.Buy a beanie along the trek if you like - I got a super warm one in Namche for around 300 rupees.Take a few batteries for your cameras if you can, as charging gets pretty expensive the further up the hill you go.All meat labelled yak is actually buffalo as yaks are far too valuable to just slaughter. You will find that eating meat becomes more risky to eat the further up the hill you go. This means the longer the meat has been sitting on someone's back the further up you go. Avoid when required ask your guide here.Four people of the original seven from our group made it to base camp. Three were not fully prepared - one person had a cyclists water coat as a wind breaker!!!! I suggested getting something warmer than the \"Cape\" he had.I would recommend this company due to the savings and the fantastic nature of our guide and porters. Not sure what extras you would receive from other more expensive companies."

A guided tour around Kathmandu was informative, interesting and exciting. So sad to see the devastation caused by the earthquake, earlier this year, but inspiring to see the Nepalese people getting on with their lives. The trek was equally well organised and Bim, our guide and the 3 porters, looked after our group of 5 brilliantly. Unfortunately, I wasn't well on the first 4 days of the trek, but Bim paced me and I was able to get to the Annapurna Base Camp, without Bim's knowledge, expertise and encouragement, I probably wouldn't have completed the trek. However, the trek was fantastic, the scenery was stunning and seeing the sun rise over the Base Camp was one of the most inspiring things I ever seen. As a 65 year old, I achieved a lifetime ambition and I'm now contemplating a Everest Base Camp trek, with Outfitter Nepal, next year."

With the assistance of more than a dozen local workmen and Outfitter's guide Hari, I was able to complete \"The Pani Project\" This project included the repairing, replacing, and rebuilding of a water system for the Shree Achane Higher Secondary School in Khahare.It was an amazing experience that would not have been possible without the excellent suggestions, help, encouragement and support from Hari Bahadur and Outfitter Nepal. An extra special thanks to Hari for all of his hard work and for his exceptional local knowledge and expertise.I continue to be inspired by the great people at Outfitter Nepal and thier commitment to rebuild thier nation.

Hi all just returned from katmandu and a 15 day trip trekking to Anna Purna well what can I say from the moment I stepped of the plane I was out of my comfort zone it was chaotic manic and frenzied I was met by a representative of outfitter Nepal and we where soon on our way to our first hotel,,,we pulled up late and it all looked scary hotel was under renovation at the time so there where a few loose ends needed finalising,next day went on a tour of katmandu full day very eye opening tour and marvelled in sights I had never seen before,next day we started our adventure of on a 6hour drive where we would start our trek was never worried at the fuel crisis out there even when seeing thousands of people waiting for a bit of fuel we where assured tourist buses would be OK and we was. Thankfully,the trek well I can say is I'm not a Trekker in any form my training for this was a comfortable stroll round picturesque lakes where I live topping it of with a swim a couple of times a week I was comfortable in belief I would stroll round the whole circuit without discomfort,,,,,arrghhh I was in for a shock it nearly broke me ,lol.i remember the man replying to my email expressing my concerns about my fitness and if I would make the circuit,his reply was if you have a strong heart you will do it ,well I guess I have a strong heart because I got stronger every day,,17stone lump am I and I do consider myself a couch potato or did,,the trip was awesome the views where totally overwhelming the simplicity of local life upon the mountain trails where fantastic and so refreshing the leg work was calf busting but rewarding as every turn and uphill hike meant full on wild life from mountain goats in there hundreds troops of monkeys eagles etc,,the mountain tops where in sight and we was eager to get there I won't spoil it for you when u get to see the sun rise at Anna Purna base camp you will know ,,even at 6am from then all down hill very hard to turn my back on the views that I struggled to climb to see but you do and before you no it you are winding your way down trails and meandering to the bottom where you are picked up and drove back to a hotel where being deprived of luxury for a few days meant hot water and a comfy bed was 6star ,the Sherpas where immense so young so strong carrying two large bags of our gear each full credit to them the guide made you feel in good hands and overall the company outfitter Nepal did a great job even taking us out to dinner on the final night to say thank you and to get some feed back,if you're wondering about is it safe to go I would say yes deffo the city was in a bit of chaos but the mountains where so calm and tranquil,,again I'm not a big walker and I was hovering over the buy button for ages when first paying for this trip and all I can say is I'm so glad I had the nerve to push buy ,,it was eye opening culture vulture back breaking awesome and I take my hat of to this company efficient reliable and under the recent tragic circumstances which has befallen this country I'd say first class outfitter Nepal I'd go again and I'd tell all to go to hope people return in there numbers once again ,,,,ow hello to my group that trekked good meeting you ,Noel Barrington ,England"

            "review": "A brilliant holiday with a brilliant company. We booked the Nepal View Tour with Outfitter Nepal. This was a varied package of sightseeing in Kathmandu, trekking and wildlife in Chitwan NP. From the outset, our enquiries were dealt with quickly and efficiently by Arjun, who arranged the holiday for us, including a number of extras.We were met at the airport and from then onwards, the holiday and all its arrangements ran very smoothly. All the accommodation was of a good standard and the transport, whether by private car, taxi or bus, went well. Our contact \"on the ground\" was Raj, who was available for support throughout and who readily changed our last day so that we could visit a temple that we'd missed earlier.The undoubted highlight was our trek to Ghorepani and Poon Hill. Although this might be deemed easy by Nepalese standards, we found the walking to be satisfying and sometimes challenging. The countryside is extremely beautiful and varied, with farmland, villages and views of the mountains, particularly the walk up to Poon Hill to see the sunrise on a clear morning Special mention goes to our companions, guide Sanjay and porter Rajan. They looked after us well and were excellent throughout, we can't thank them enough. They are both true gentlemen and a credit to the company.For anyone thinking about visiting Nepal after the earthquake, you definitely should. There has been some damage, but all the tourist sites are up and running and there is plenty to see. It's a beautiful place and the people are lovely.We had a brilliant holiday in Nepal. Many thanks to Outfitter Nepal who are an excellent, professional company with great staff. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone."

I travelled with Outfitters for the Everest Base Camp trek (the first one since the Earthquake) at the end of August and I have to say they were so good! Originally our trek was due to leave after the first earthquake and after much panic on my side about re-scheduling my trek, Outfitters were quick to respond to my millions of emails and handled the whole situation with true profession. Our tour was re-scheduled within days. I was blown away.Our Base camp trek guides Suraj and Dipak were great group leaders and their knowledge and experience of the trail felt second to none! They were very friendly and happily answered any questions or concerns I had in great detail. I felt very safe in their hands! My friend and I also had planned to visit other areas of Nepal for which Arjun at Outfitters organised for us at no extra hassle. He had a full week and a half of itinerary planned for us to visit Pohkara and Chitwan N.P which went to plan without a hitch. I have to say our experience of visiting Nepal wouldn't of been as incredible as it was, if it wasn't for Outfitters.. So thank you!"

            "review": "Professional and responsible tour company . My friend and I booked the 12 days EBC trekking package from Outfitter Nepal via Groupon. This was our 2nd time to Nepal. We were very excited and thrilled of the altitude. Nevertheless, on the 7th day of our trek, the devastating Nepal Earthquake happened. We are really blessed and protected by God throughout the next 6 days, and I think one of the biggest reason is because we have good support of mountain guide Raj, assistant mountain guide Sunil and porters who had worked their very best to ensure our remaining trek as safe as possible. (1) Comfort On the days before the earthquake, the teahouse that we stayed are reasonably comfortable (we have make mental preparation that we are coming for trekking tour, not luxury tour). Some even with hot shower! On the days after the earthquake, the team really worked their best to get us safe, undamaged teahouse to stay. I was really blessed that none of the day I need to stay in a tent or dining hall. Many do not have places to stay, or have to sleep in dining hall / corridor. I'm thankful to our porters. Everyday they RUN (imagine to run downhill with aftershocks and landslide happened, not to forget at least 20+kg loaded on their back!) to the next village in order to secure room booking for us. During that period of time, phone network was down and it's impossible to made phone booking with the teahouse. They are like superhero.(2) Safety We have 1 head guide and 1 assistance guide for a group of 11 people. Usually the assistance guide will lead the group with the head guide as the last. Every night our head guide Raj will provide a briefing on the next day trek details after dinner. He is full of experience on the trek and can spell out the details of the trek to the team. Personally I find the briefing is really useful for mental preparation. Yeap, I didn't read the itinerary. On the day the earthquake happened, when all network was down, we rely on word of mouth and were clueless on the severity of the earthquake. Our head guide made the decision of descend base on info on hand. The decision was made for safety reason. We had met another group that delay the decision of descend and the whole group end up have to stay put in dining hall at the last pit stop - Lukla. (3) Fun We have fun and exciting moments throughout the trek. Even though after the crisis happen, with worries on our mind, we still try to have some fun (in a subdue way). Our mountain guide and assistance guide, though worried of their friends and families in Kathmandu and their village, has been very supportive to us. It was a sad moment, and I think only by understanding and respect each other can the whole team pull it through the crisis. The Outfitter team works far more than what I had mentioned above. I'm safely back home without any severe health / injury issue. I always have access to food, clean water and lodging during the days of crisis. Despite I do not have money to pay for flight from Biratnaga to Kathmandu (during crisis there were no small aircraft being able to land in Kathmandu Airport ), the company had prepaid for my flight to get back to Kathmandu. They are sincere people. They did their best to keep us safe though they have bigger worries and urgency for their home and family. Words couldn't express how much I appreciate what the Outfitter team has done. The beauty of Nepal and Nepalese will always remain in my heart."

From the moment I had emailed Outfitter Nepal to schedule my trek a year ago and till the day I left for my flight they have been right there through it all. Email correspondence was fast and easy. Outfitter Nepal was very informative and helpful. Before we went on our trek we had a nice city tour and had briefings to discuss what would happen throughout the trek. Namaraj who goes by ANDY took care of everything in Kathmandu. Our trip was led by Raj (main guide) and Sumil (assistant guide). We had a great group and enjoyed ourselves during the trek. Both Raj and Sumil were very accommodating, entertaining, helpful, and fun. Unfortunately, halfway through my trek I became very sick. It was not from AMS, I had eaten something and was having intense abdominal pain that I had to be helicoptered back to Kathmandu. Raj and Andy both took care of my insurance company and figured things out for me to arrive safely in KTM. Upon arrival I did not expect anyone from Outfitter Nepal to come visit me at the hospital. Andy showed up to check on me and to see if I needed anything. He told me he would come the next day to pick me up and take care of things. I was very thankful that I had someone there to help as I was not feeling well at all. The only people that were helping me was my boyfriend and sister who were across the world from me and they could not do anything for me in Nepal. I was alone if Andy was not there for me.Andy took care of everything till the end. He took me to the hotel the next day, made all the arrangements for the airport and even got me some gatorade! Maybe the Gatorade sounds silly but honestly it was a life saver. I came home and was hospitalized and found that I had a parasite. I am finally recovering and much better. The night I left Kathmandu... 8 hours later is when the earthquake took place. I am not sure if my illness was a blessing or a curse but I was very lucky to have left the time I did. My friend who was still on the trek was a day away from Everest Base Camp when the earthquake had struck. Fortunately, the group was not affected and because of the care of Outfitter Nepal my best friend just made it home on Sunday safely. Even in this catastrophe Outfitter Nepal stood strong and stood by their customers and for that I truly respect them. They are all so genuine and I could not ask for more. I would recommend them over and over again. They truly care and are the best of the best! Martha Ha"

We arrived on the 23rd of April to adjust to time, take Everest flight and sightsee in Kathmandu. We visited the office of Outfitter Nepal and met Raj. When the earthquake happened, we were in a taxi 10 minutes from Bhaktapur. Returned to our hotel in Thamel which had sustained damage. Raj and Outfitter Nepal instructed us to go to Hotel Moonlight where we were well informed, safe until we could fly out on the 29th. It was an oasis for trekkers. I would like to thank Raj and Outfitter Nepal for their complete and utter devotion to its clientele. We were so fortunate to have such support during this catastrophic and devastating event. Although our trek never began, I have the very highest regard for Outfitter Nepal."

They provided extremely quick communication prior to my trip and nothing but exceptional service from all members of the team throughout the trip. I cannot praise our guide Rajee enough for the great job he did guiding us through the cities and trekking through the mountains. It was an amazing trip with a very well planned itinerary that allowed us to see many of the different regions of Nepal, however the 5 day hike around Annapurna was the absolute highlight. The views were gorgeous and the people delightful. During the tour the majority of food was provided as was all accommodation and transfers which took a lot of stress out of planning a trip.

Prior to the trek I was dealing directly with Arjun via email who was prompt with his responses and extremely helpful. On arrival to the meeting point at hotel Moonlight (good hotel) the group was met by Raj who gave us a detailed brief on what to expect during the trek and again answered any questions the group had. When we arrived at Lukla airport the group was met by Birodh the guide and his support staff (assistant guides/porters). The whole transition was seamless. I was very impressed by the coordination.Birodh was outstanding as the lead guide. He was very motivating, knowledgeable and observant to the needs of the group. While he was jovial throughout the trek, he was able to make the tough decisions when required (evacuating people back to Lukla) and constantly adjust to the appropriate course of action to keep the trek moving forward.I would strongly recommend Outfitter for any trek you intend to do. I had an outstanding experience and would not hesitate to trek with them when I get the chance to do the Annapurna circuit.For the trek be aware:- Although it suggests you should be able to walk 4-6h. Most days were longer than this and there are some very steep slopes both up and down, coupled with the high altitude. You need to have at least a basic level of fitness, but this doesn\u2019t mean age restrictions apply (except being too young).- Drink 4-5L water a day without fail (or whatever ensures urine is mostly clear each time). This will get you out of bed multiple times during the night but it is necessary.- People do get evacuated by helicopter more regularly than you\u2019d think due to Acute Mountain Sickness symptoms. Don\u2019t be afraid of this; just be aware as it is easily managed by managing yourself \u201cEat on time, drink on time and sleep on time\u201d.The team/guides will discuss everything else in detail for you to be aware of. Listen to their advice."

I almost don't want to boast because I don't want it to turn into a super tourist spot! There were very few trekkers, making this trail even more special. Every turn was a picturesque moment! Most of the lodges were run by families and had limited electricity and showers, however, it was a perfect escape from the city I am currently living in. Our guide was fantastic and our porters were as well. They took care of us, encouraged us and answered any questions we had. The people in the villages were friendly and welcoming!

Everything, from start to finish was awesome. My sister and I were picked from the airport and taken to a good hotel in the heart of the tourist area of Kathmandu, a great location. The next day we had a city tour of Kathmandu, Our guide was lovely, spoke good English and gave us lots if valuable information. We were able to take our time at each of the places we visited and were never rushed to get to the next place. She also gave us a great insight into everyday life of Nepalese people - marriage, health care, education, death etc Next the journey to Chiwan National Park with white water rafting on the way. How exciting and a great way to break up the long journey through stunningly beautiful countryside. The guide at Chitwan was very difficult to understand at first but after a while we did become accustomed to his English. He was very knowledgable of the local area, traditions and especially the wildlife. We floated down the croc infested river in a dugout canoe to the jungle in order to spot rhino, wild boar, deer and other wild animals. He showed signs of where tigers had been, where rhinos had mud bathed and scratched against the trees then we saw a rhino! Later that day we went on an elephant safari through the jungle spotting many more animals - elephants don't need tracks or paths! Lastly, we went to Pokhara in the mountains. Again, a hotel in a great location and a great guide for the city tour. Our driver was very quiet and did not speak much english but he was very considerate and a really safe driver. I can't say enough good things about this company, they would do anything to help make your tour the best experience they possibly could."

Since we were stuck in transit for 4 days we had very limited access to communication, which made us quite worried as emails weren't replied as quick as we'd hoped.We arrived at the airport at 12 at night to which it took us 2 hours to get our luggage. As we had no real means to communicate that we had arrived, we were worried that we'd have to find our own transport and accommodation for the night.

From the first email to Arjun, requesting details of possible trips, to our final drop off at the airport at 5am everything went as smooth as clockwork. Our inward flight was delayed by 6 hours due to fog at Kathmandu Airport. We had further delays due to the large numbers queuing for visas. Despite these long delays as soon as we emerged from the airport we spotted our pick up. We have no idea how long he had to wait around for us, but he was a most welcome sight! This attention to detail was replicated in all our experiences on the tour.Our guide, Birodh, and his two assistants did everything to make our trek as enjoyable as possible. Our accommodation, meals, the pace of the trek, etc. - all excellent. As we had a spare day at the end of our trek Raj organised a tour to Bhaktapur and Patan. Again, a very enjoyable experience with a lovely guide.For anyone considering a trip to Nepal, no matter what their particular needs are, we would without hesitation recommend Outfitter Nepal as the best of tour/trekking companies."

This was a fantastic experience and Outfitter Nepal were very professional in their service and everyone was friendly, everything ran smoothly from the airport pickup to the day to day trekking.Our guides Raj Thapa and Deepak were awesome and fun to do the trip with, they were very helpful when I fell sick from altitude sickness and had to be airlifted and Raj Kumar from the Outfitter office was great in helping deal with my insurance company and the hospital once I was back in Kathmandu.Great company to go with and I'll be using them again when I visit Nepal again."

            "review": "Brilliant start to finish.. We chose Outfitter Nepal based on friends who used them 5 years ago and said how great they were then. We were not disappointed! Booking from the UK was straightforward and we really appreciated the quick responses to questions etc... Even when we had to change our flight time last minute, they were flexible in our pick up. Our whole trek in Nepal was seamlessly organised by Outfitter Nepal, we never had to worry about how we would get places or what we needed to do. Much of this is down to the excellent guides they employ. Our guide was very personable and caring and along with our porter made our trip even more enjoyable and exciting with good natured jokes and informative explanations of the local people and mountains which is priceless when you have long days of walking and sometimes need a little encouragement. We really enjoyed the trek that Outfitter Nepal put together for us up to Annapurna Base Camp and want to thank Raj and his team for such an amazing time and our guide Mohan for his outstanding leadership and company. I think what makes Outfitter Nepal an excellent choice over the many rivals out there is the individual service you receive, you are more than just another client, they know who you are, what you want to do and are keen to tailor to your needs. The fact that the co-owner Raj spent some time"

            "review": "Adventure of All Lifetimes. My new husband and I booked a special package tour with Outfitter Nepal for our honeymoon and from the absolute beginning of our emails with Arjun (one of the company directors) to their organizing a car to drive us back to the airport, we have had a fantastic experience. Because we got this tour through a special deal provider, we didn't know what to expect and thought it might be a cheap abridged version of Nepal's sightseeing potential. But instead, we had an amazing itinerary full of cultural and historical sightseeing, then a challenging and very rewarding 5 day trek to Poon Hill, a relaxing 2 day jungle safari, and a lovely farewell dinner with Raj (company manager). The itinerary was set out well: something low key, then a challenging trekking adventure, and then the opportunity to wind down again. The guides and porters from Outfitter Nepal were excellent: friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable and helpful. Within a day, our group (we had a perfect group size of 10) and the guides/porters were getting along like family. My husband and I had arrived a day earlier than the tour was officially starting, and Raj had given us the option to go on an additional day tour to visit Bhaktapur and Patan which was great. All our accommodation and food had been organised prior to our arrival; all our transitions between lodges and hotels were smooth and we didn't experience any problems or disruptions to our holiday at all.Perhaps in the near future, Outfitter Nepal could add a small amount into the fees ($10 per person maybe?) to go towards helping porters purchase good trekking gear for themselves like footwear, clothing, rain gear etc. The porters are so hard working and wonderful, I personally would love to see them getting treated well. As mentioned, the porters we had with Outfitter Nepal were fantastic. The trek level of difficulty was rated as 'easy' but for a Westerner of average fitness, I'd probably rate it more as 'medium'. Perhaps Outfitter Nepal could include a basic fitness guide to help tourists gauge if they can successfully complete the trek (example: how often do you exercise a week? Are you able to walk 5km a day with minimal difficulty? Etc). That being said, our trekking guide Santos was extremely patient and accommodating and reiterated that the trek was not a race and for everyone to go at their natural pace and listen to their bodies. We are sad to leave this beautiful country and it's even more beautiful people, but are looking forward to coming back and traveling with Outfitter Nepal again. Thank you for your hospitality! We will never forget this trip!"

The whole trip, from Kathmandu to Sagarmatha, and even the extension trip I had to Pokhara was executed seamlessly. I had been worried about not being picked up at the airport/busstop at various locations, but everything was perfect. From pickups to the hotel, to the day tours, everything was just planned and well coordinated.I had a great time with my guide Deepak while we were in the mountains, who took care of me all the way, especially when I started getting altitude sickness. The trek was excellent, even though I was unable to do the Kongma La pass, and poor weather marred the experience at Cho La and Gokyo. Being up in the mountains away from the rest of the world was refreshing."

My brother and I book Nepal tour with Everest Base Camp trek with Outfitter Nepal and after numerous informative replies from Arjun (of Outfitter Nepal), we booked ourselves to join the Everest Base Camp trek\\tour in early May 2014. Alongside 2 other fellow trekkers, we were introduced to our friendly guide Vim and the latter's intimate knowledge of the paths, conditions, etc made our experience an unforgettable one. All domestic flights, teahouse bookings, porters, etc were organized flawlessly. As it so happens, my brother and I were affected by AMS and had to stay in Namche for some time as a precaution. Our guide Vim was prompt to make sure that we would be looked after by the teahouse owners and organised for one porter to stay behind just in case we felt better and wanted to keep trekking. While Vim pushed on with the other 2 trekkers and another porter, he regularly kept in touch with the Namche teahouse owners to see how we were going + also advised us of the upcoming plans (ie, day that he would be back). So, while my brother and I didn't make it to EBC (through no fault from Outfitter Nepal), we felt safe in the knowledge that we were looked after at all times and were able to relax\\recuperate. While on the tracks, Vim was excellent at gauging and adapting to our various levels of fitness and desire to take pictures of the fantastic surroundings. Overall, It was such a great experience that I know that my brother and one of the other trekkers are already planning another trek with Outfitter Nepal next year. As for me, I will definitely go with them again in a few years' time with my son (when he is older) and would gladly recommend Outfitter Nepal to my friends as an excellent trekking company to go with in Nepal."

Outfitter stood out because of the speed of reply and focus on what I was hoping for out of a city tour. I am so glad I went with this tour company and many thanks to Arjun for answering so many questions in advance of arrival!I may have been the only person in Kathmandu not on a trek, but appreciated that guide Bikash understood my interest in learning about the city, culture, and temples. We had a nice balance of history, fun facts, and a little shopping. As a single female traveling alone, I felt very safe the whole time and Bikash did a great job of keeping an eye on how I was feeling in the heat. I believe the sign of a good guide is when they feel less like an escort and more like a highly knowledgeable friend. Bikash certainly achieved this!I would recommend Outfitter Nepal for their services - they were great about all coordination, quick replies, and an amazing experience during my few short days in Kathmandu. Thanks again!(Side note - Make sure you have two passport size photos with you upon entering Kathmandu. You can take your picture at the airport for a price and a little delay. Also there are two entry forms to complete. Many people missed this!)"

And what impressed me mot was that I booked on a group trek but even though the other people who were suppose to depart on the same day as me changed their trip and leaving only myself for the trip, Outfitter still proceeded instead of cancelling or postponing the trip. I can't say that for many other agencies around. Outfitter was also very helpful on my final day of the trek. All flights from Lukla to Kathmandu were cancelled due to bad weather. They were able to make alternative arrangements and even helped to negotiate a good deal for me. A+. Strongly recommended."

What is most remarkable though is that the trips were undertaken with young children (Aged 8 and 11 in 2011). They loved spending time with the team, learned to play the drums, ploughed fields with an oxen drawn plough and sang songs around a campfire in the evenings. Priceless memories for them and us.

Starting in Kathmandu they organised everything effeciently whether it was transport, meals, trekking permits or accommodation as we travelled to Pokhara and then trekked up to Muktinath. Even when we encountered problems such as when our flight back from Jomsom to Pokhara was cancelled their friendly and well-trained staff Prakash and Gitu handled everything perfectly ensuring we still made it back that day while keeping our spirits up with their infectious positivity! Fully recommended."

Everything promised by the company was delivered, from the airport pick-up, to the quality accommodation in Kathmandu ,Chitwan , Pokhara, Lhasa, Thimphu and Paro. I had an incredible time driving through the mountains from Kathamandu to Lhasa- the Himalayas are something that you really need to see if you haven't been there. The guide was really flexible and stopping anytime I wanted a break or something to eat or to take pictures - and there was many many picture . The hotels were great - particularly the delicious food that I'd get each day.

First I was greeted beautifully at my hotel, picked up in the best tour car I have had in my time in Kathmandu. Then we went to SABHA and I actually got to meet the CEO of this initiative who spoke about the history, what they do, why it's important and so on. Then upstairs I went and got to meet the head production manager who gave me a personalised tour, I met all the girls, saw designs they were working on and I was absolutely gobsmacked by how much work goes into this!!! Then, I opted to go to their village and see where all the home based works were working. I saw the village, walked through all the streets with the guide and got to see first hand their living environments, festivals etc. Then my guide suggested going to the disabled school association... This was confronting but a must!!!! Please go and see this, it will allow you to raise awareness back in Australia. I met he founders son who gave me a tour and explained how things work there. Go to this!!Then it was off to the SABHA store which is opposite hotel Himalaya, I wanted to buy souvenirs that were made by Nepal people where I could see how much effort etc went into it so bought a few nice things here. If you don't have the chance on tour make sure you take taxi here. Very reasonable pricing considering the hours of effort that goes into it!!Then I went to the village cafe and had a platter, yum so nice to have authentic food from the people. Off then to karma coffee, the only coffee boutique here in kathmandu - yum! Picked up at 915 and returned at 5, it was a big day but lots of relaxing in car rides to and from places and good pace to see so many different elements of the culture. Highly recommend!! Didn't have time for cooking class but this also looks really good. Do as many tours as you can with this company!!"

Dawa, my guide with Socialtours arranged my day to visit Shivapuri National Park in the morning and a cooking class in the afternoon. Shivapuri is closeby to Kathmandu, a ride up on Bansbari road, then about a little more than an hour walk to a monastery. It is an enjoyable hike even for someone like me who doesn't exercise regularly (the stairs to the monastery was probably the hardest). Pretty perfect for a nature getaway close to the city. Dawa, my guide is a Sherpa, so he's from the mountains of Nepal. He's knowledgeable with many stories to tell as I learn from him about Nepali culture. From the top, there's a great view of the Kathmandu Valley with all the colorful buildings. We stopped by the monastery for Buddhist nuns and had a nice butter tea (an acquired taste, like drinking butter). It was Sunday so the nuns had a day off, especially little girls came out to play. I liked the quiet peace of the place and people. After lunch, we went back to the Socialtours office right in the middle of the touristy Thamel for a cooking class. I was joined by 2 Canadian girls and a French man for cooking momos (super yummy) with our chef, Sakuntala. Sakun is really smiley and a fun teacher for this cooking experience. She gave clear instructions and we all received the recipes by email, so I'll definitely try to make momos at home to impress my family. A wonderful afternoon with good company and delicious momos!"

I love that they have half-day and full day tours to a wide range of KTM monuments. The absolutely BEST part about Social Tours, though, is that they don't just visit common tourist spots. They take a different approach, focusing on local culture. The Temples and Lakes tour is an excellent example of this. Although you travel around Kirtipur and learn history and about the temples, you walk through villages and get a very different sense of life in Nepal outside of KTM. It is an easy walk I've done with friends as well as my two very young children (1 and 3). You end the tour at The Bottle House for a fantastic meal. Anyone spending longer than a day in KTM should definitely consider this tour."

It was nice to spend a few hours with other travellers, meet new people and learn some traditional cooking techniques. The staff spoke English well and were very sweet. We took a short trip to the market, got the ingredients, then went back to the kitchen and started prepping. They had enough supplies for everyone so we all got to work together. Although I've made momo's before it was nice to learn a different technique (they showed us two) and how they add the spices for different flavour. I liked that it was by donation and no set cost. Really gave the attendee the chance to pay what they felt the experience equated. AND I can't believe how delicious our momo's tasted. It was fun, and as a foreigner living like a local, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience!"

We went shopping for ingredients at shops that I had walked right past before and now understood how they worked. \"Yes the meat store was a little scary\". Then we made two kinds of mo mo's and the sauces to go with them plus soup. You can read a recipe but you don't get the the little nuances of preparation until you see it done. Sakuntala and Asmita were great at walking me through the process, answering questions and very helpful with my lack of folding skills. It was all very relaxed. For a more local kind of experience and if you just love food I would highly recommend this class. I should have done the Dal Bhat class also. The place is a little hard to find, It's at the very end of a side street. Use your GPS."

It feels a little ironic that you are helping the chef cook food that she would have been cooking for the staff anyways and then pay them for it.

The 'shopping for food' portion of the trip was good, allowed for me to know that the meat came from a cold storage place and wasn't just sitting out on a table. also because of the shopping we were able to buy some of the 'momo spices' to take home. The kitchen is very adequate and met the needs of the class. there was no power but the instructor hung a flashlight in the middle of the table and solved the issue. All of my questions were answered and we had a good time making the momo's. I would recommend this tour if you would like to make a special food from Nepal. the atmosphere is relaxed and fun. the owner and a few employees joined us at the end of class to help us eat the momo's (we made about 70). If you have time in Kathmandu you won't regret this experience! Just a tip that the 2015 Lonely Planet book does not show this cooking class location in the correct spot, the earlier version does. so the location is actually near the 'garden of dreams' and thanks to the Social Tours staff for meeting me at a nearby restaurant and taking me to class so there was no confusion. Would also really recommend Social Tours, in general. we didn't get the opportunity to utilise them for any other tours, but they are super friendly and knowledgeable about Nepal."

We arrived in Kathmandu on a Saturday when the office was closed, so returned on Sunday and were able to get into the afternoon cooking class. After a trip to the grocer and shops to buy supplies, we headed to the kitchen where tasks were divided up amongst our group of 6. Everything was made from scratch, and explained fully by Sakuntala, although the atmosphere was very light-hearted and casual. We loved learning the technique for making two different shapes of momo (we did a chicken filling and a mixed vege filling), and had a chance to perfect it after making lots! We also learned to make two delicious dipping sauces. While the momos were cooking, we chatted with our fellow classmates in the courtyard, then ate the product of our labour together as a group. The momos were so so delicious and so plentiful! This was such a great way to spend an afternoon and is highly recommended to anyone with a few hours to spare in Kathmandu. We can't wait to learn how to make dal bhat on a future trip!"

            "review": "See more of the locals. We did two trips with socialtours. On our first day we had a 2-3 hour walk around town (it was called splice of Kathmandu). The description talks about walking through different markets, but this part of town feels more like one big market - there are vendors absolutely everywhere. So, in the end it felt more like \"just\" a walking tour - not to detract from the experience, just that this is an unusually easy town to wander around on your own and take random turns to discover new interesting sights. We had a really nice guide (Sherpa) and enjoyed not only having someone help get us quickly acquainted with this bustling city (especially nice if you only have a few days here) but also to find our way through back alleys with surprising discoveries we would not easily have found on our own. Our second trip was \"the working nepali\", which entailed a short drive to the nearby villages of Bungamati and Khokana. Our walk consisted of a big loop through these two villages where we got to see locals doing metalworking on statues for temples, weaving rugs, doing woodworking etc, as well as (yet another) beautiful temple square. Although it felt a bit touristy (what a shocker) walking past these workshops, looking over their shoulders as they worked and passing a few other groups, nonetheless it also felt like a genuine experience, with these people all doing their daily work and none of them trying to sell us anything. Well, at one place they did offer something for sale, but my point is you don't feel like you're riding one of those big tour buses, where you all pile out at one time and the locals are all clamoring to sell you something. These people were all friendly (some just ignored us and others waved, smiled and invited us to come see what they were doing), going about their jobs - we really enjoyed this trip and would warmly recommend it to anyone interested in seeing some local culture."

I really wanted to do something local in Kathmandu on my first trip to Nepal and the momo class seemed like the best choice.I must say the cook, Sakuntala's smile could seriously light up the whole world! Right from when I first walked into the office, she offered us tea, and then took us to the market buying the ingredients, and we came back to a huge kitchen, which was super clean and she instructed on the copping and the dicing. I hate chopping but it was so much fun doing with 5 other people, felt like a family. The weather cleared up and we moved to the outdoor table and it felt like holiday:) Even though the shapes of our momos were as diversified as our nationalities, it still was enjoyable. We made spinach and cheese momo, veg momo, chocolate momo, and two kinds of dips. Then we all sat down at the table enoying our handiwork in plates made of leaves and the owner joined us as well. It was super fun. I even went for seconds and thirds!Totally recommend anyone visiting Kathmandu to enjoy this cooking session. Sakunthala is a very competent and super friendly cook who made the entire experience wonderful."

Making momos isn't easy and having tried the technique I now have a new aprechiation for them.At the end we got to eat everything we made and try out some mars bar momos! The recipes were emailed to us so we can at least attempt them at home. The only downside was deciding what to pay when we finished!

The class should be marketed as more of a cooking demonstration as with a group of six people there isn't enough for everyone to do. My sole 'cooking' activity included chopping up some cauliflower and garlic - hardly challenging or interesting. Similarly the shopping trip at the beginning of the class wasn't very interesting - it encompassed visiting only one tiny grocery shop that was too small for us all to stand in - I ended up standing on the street for most of the time we were there.Despite this, I did enjoy the company and the meal at the end of the class, and the teacher was really lovely. If you are simply looking to learn more about Nepalese food and enjoy a nice meal than I would recommend this class. If however you are an avid cook you might be left disappointed.The process of 'paying what you think the tour is worth' was also quite uncomfortable - at the end of the class we all had to sit in a room advising one at a time what we were willing to pay. I'd recommend a price for this tour be introduced - alternatively let people make an anonymous donation rather than being made to feel uncomfortable by having to share with everyone...."

We first travelled to Nepal five years ago to Annapurna with Social Tours, and this time we did four separate \"day tours\" with them in Kathmandu. First - the famed \"cook like a local\" where we made momos/dumplings - and we really did do it from scratch, having to finely chop the ingredients, roll our own pastry and then fold them under the expert tuition fo Dawa. then, we ate them, and so did the Boss !The next day we travelled to Bhaktapur with a private guide and driver. A little like Kathmandu's Durbar square, but certainly different enough to be worth it and nice to see some countryside.After our return from Tibet we went on a short hike to the hills to the South of Kathmandu, offering a little exercise and a wonderful view over the city. We even saw Makalu poking out of the clouds.On the last day we had a cycling trip to an organic farm where we had an excellent \"free range\" lunch. The guides were very good, putting up with us as we had never really been on mountain bikes ! By the end we were scooting round the streets avoiding motorbikes cars and locals. A bike is certainly a good way to get round.All of the day tours were well designed, good value, and chilled. More importantly we felt like part of the Social Tours family, every time we arrived at the office we were looked after and welcomed, and we even went for lunch with Bipin, who looked after us on our first visit. The money you can save dealing directly with Social Tours over a British company is huge, and you should have no worry at all about them as they are one of the most rapidly growing companies in Kathmandu. We're already thinking about out next trip !"

I did the Momo and Dal Bhat cooking classes and had a wonderful time. For the ever popular Momo class I was one of about 6 attendees. We went to a small local store and butcher in Thamel for our ingredients then went back to the kitchen for the teacher to attempt teaching us how to fold momo. Rolling and folding is an art, that our teacher made look incredibly easy. After creating a lot of wonky momo we enjoyed plates of chicken, vegetarian and also some sweet momos which were fantastic. I decided to pay 1,500 rp (about $15) as this is what they were charging for a similar class elsewhere.The Dal Bhat class I did by myself 2 days later, no one else had signed up (momos are more popular I think) and again had a wonderful time. It was actually the best Dal Bhat I had in Nepal (and I had a lot in the mountains).I would highly recommend attending these classes, the staff are all wonderful and I had an amazing time."

We are experienced, off-the-beaten-trail travelers and usually avoid packaged tours in favor of getting a more local feel of the destination. In this case we had a more in-depth experience in Nepal with Socialtours than we could have done on our own and the price was probably lower as well.We first contacted Socialtours since we wanted to do a Nepalese cooking class, but after exploring their website and receiving gracious and informative emails we decided to book 5 days with them including rafting, pottery and an early morning heritage tour of Bhaktapur. We met with Bipin our first morning and together finalized our itinerary - there were a lot of flexible options, and we could have happily stayed in Nepal for weeks. What we picked was a mix of culture and exploring the beautiful countryside. Some days we had both a driver and a guide to provide background information and answer questions. Dawa Sherpa was our regular host and he was very knowledgeable and gracious, and we were handed over to local guides at other locations. Some days we were on our own which suited us perfectly - Nepal is an easy country to get around and the people were consistently friendly.The cooking class with Anura Rai was a special highlight for us, and the Thimi Pottery tour was very interesting. I would encourage anyone planning a trip to Nepal to contact Socialtours."

            "review": "Momo class was fantastic!. We headed down to Thamel for our momo cooking class at Social Tours the other day. Two other people were there. They had joined the class late, so since Mom and I booked first, we had chosen to make momos, and specifically, veg momos and spinach and cheese momos. It was such a fun class! The teacher was a young Nepali woman named Sockun. She was so nice. She learned to make momos from her sister. First, she took us shopping! We went to a stall that you walked inside of, and it took up two or three normal stall spaces. These are spaces like at a storage facility, where the front metal door rolls up like a garage door. This one had vegetables and cookies and breads. We bought onions (red and green) cabbage, tomatoes, and a carrot, plus some fresh ginger and garlic, and also some spices. Then we went to a third stall that had what looked like a refrigerated counter, but I couldn\u2019t tell if it was actually kept cold. Inside were several kinds of cheese. We bought four blocks of what looked like smoked cheddar. I asked Sockun what kind of cheese it was, and she said, \u201cYak cheese\u201d. Then, we walked back to the Social Tours office. We went around the side and to the rear of the building, where we found a beautiful kitchen. It has a big counter with a built-in propane stove, and cubby hole shelving along the back wall with utensils, mixing bowls, and dishes. There was a sink in the corner, and a table with a large jug of drinking water. Sockun put us to working chopping vegetables. She washed them three times in tap water, then three more in the bottled water. She made us chop them very fine. She cooked the tomatoes for about ten or fifteen minutes for the sauces: a spicy hot pickle, and a peanut sauce (yes it had tomatoes in it!) Then she cooked the spinach for ten minutes or so, and let it cool. One of the other students made the dough out of just flour and water. She kneaded it, and while she was doing that, I grated cheese, and Mom and another student chopped more veg. When we finished with that, we added spices to the bowls and then went outside to roll the momos, because it was getting really hot in that room with the stove on. Outside they have a beautiful picnic table with a red tile top. We sat down and oiled the pans for the steamer. Then Sockun gave us each a rolling pin and some dough. We pinched off little tiny pieces and rolled them into circles, or at least something mildly resembling a circle. Sockuns were perfect, though. Then she showed us how to put a spoonful of filling in the middle of a circle of dough and then pinch and fold, pinch and fold, until you make your way around and it becomes a crescent. All of ours were pitiful at first, but I got pretty good with the crescents. Then she showed us how to make round ones, but I never got the hang of that, though Yana could do an expert one. She also showed us some super fancy folds, but those were well beyond my skill level. One looked like an ornate leaf. Mom said we were in danger of failing momo class, but it was really fun. Here is the link to the momo recipes: http://www.socialtours.com/Go-Local/cook-like-local.html#mo-mo After we finished rolling, they stacked the steamer pans on a pot of boiling water, and we all chatted outside for a bit. Finally, the momos were ready. They put them into dishes made of leaves! They were flimsy, but very eco-cool. The veg momos were great, but the cheese and spinach momos were everyone\u2019s favorite. The sauces were pretty good, too. Sockun had also made some special chocolate momos, and we each got one for dessert! She had taken a Mars bar and chopped it into six small pieces, then wrapped them up in the dough and steamed it. Yum! This class does not have a set fee, but you pay what you think it's worth. We paid 2000 rupees each, and it was worth all of that. Lonely Planet listed a price for the class at 750, but we were there for a good four or five hours and had such a good time that we paid more. One student paid a lot more than we did. They don't pressure you at all about what you want to pay. I highly recommend this class. We got to see how to grocery shop in Kathmandu, how to prepare the filling for the momos, how to roll them, and then, the best part: we got to enjoy the fruits of our labor! Too fun."

From the beginning I could detect they were a different travel agency from others which just use copy and paste itineraries and send to the customers. Socialtours deeply focus what are you looking for during your stay and they adapt your interests and time to the different options that Nepal offers you such as trekking, hiking, culture and sports activities and others and also a good point to remark, they try to promote in a very good wave other kind of trekkings which are not so popular as others but are more authentic, if you are willing to mix with locals and share stories with them. Besides this, they are involved in some programs to develop the poorest districts of Nepal by doing a really great job.The office also is very different it is a new concept of travel agency in comparison with others you can see around Katmandu. Even they have a fully completed kitchen where they offer several cooking courses.To sum up, very well presented programs, clear communication, necessary pre meeting to know more and better about the team, guides, managers....and very helpful.

Socialtours organized my bus tickets, guesthouse, guide, porter, and all my needs on the trek. I had a clear picture of what to expect.Once arriving in Kathmandu I had arranged my own plans, but went to Socialtours for a briefing for my upcoming trek. The Socialtours space is very welcoming and comfortable. I chatted with 2 employees who taught me about being a responsible trekker and answered all my questions. I also got to learn about some initiatives Socialtours had in place. What stood out to me was the dedication to education at Socialtours. They teach their customers about local customs and traditions. They also show us how to be responsible travelers in Nepal. The best part was the staff does this with passion. I also learned that they teach all the employees important things too. This could be about sustainability, how to recognize human trafficking, and be respectful of different cultures. I believe that they train the staff in the office and all those guides and porters that work with them too. My trek went smoothly and everything was wonderful. Once I returned to Kathmandu I joined a cooking class at the Socialtours office. That was really neat. The friendly staff also took me out on two different occasions--for coffee and breakfast. They went above and beyond to make me feel welcome, comfortable, and share their culture/organization. I highly recommend Socialtours!"

My sisters and I had the undivided attention of the very proficient (but more importantly friendly) chef and her attendant. The momos we made were delicious and plentiful, meaning we could take some with us and save money on a meal. We are very excited to experiment with the fillings and have momo parties!"

The class is really smoothly run and well organised.It was a fantastic insight into the culture, and would 100% recommend this to anyone staying in Kathmandu. The momos are also delicious! A great way to spend a morning/ afternoon. They also encourage you to pay what you think it is worth. This is nice as it takes the pressure if wondering whether the class will be worth it, or whether it is in your budget. Just pay what you honestly think it is worth and what you can afford :)"

Social Tours looked after our every need and our Guide Gilbu and porter Minmar were second to none.We have fallen in love with Nepal, not only the mountains, but the people also. We loved every village we stayed in, especially Gatlang.The charm and warmth of the local tea house owners made us feel very welcome and comfortable. After a long day of trekking it was great to get to our accommodation, have a beer and kick off our hiking boots. Every tea house we stayed in provided excellent food and we even got to try our hands at making Mo Mo's which is much harder than it looks:)) Cannot say enough about Nepal and our trip and cannot wait to go back."

We have three young boys (ages 4, 6, and 8) and we felt it was important to have a reliable and responsible agency to ensure we could trek safely and comfortably, and minimize the uncertainties involved with undertaking a multi-day trek in a foreign country. Socialtours came recommended by a friend and we still thank him for it. The agency staff in Kathmandu gave us a warm welcome, introduced us to the guide for a comprehensive briefing and made sure that we had sufficient support staff on the trek (while maintaining the original and competitive price quote). The logistics all worked out as promised. The guide and porters assigned to our trek were extremely courteous, friendly, patient and flexible, and they always looked out for the safety and comfort of our children. When we requested further assistance for other parts of our Nepal trip after the trek on an ad-hoc basis (such as bus or hotel reservations), Socialtours was always responsive and delivered without fail. If your go-it-alone backpacking days are over, this is the agency to use."

We are (mostly) vegetarian and Social Tours were more than happy to accommodate this, so we made two varieties of veggie momos, which we then got to sit and eat with the staff from Social Tours for lunch.

Our instructor was very friendly, everything was explained beautifully, the kitchen was clean and inviting, and the kids chopped the veggies, kneaded the dough, rolled out the wrappers and learnt how to seal the momos properly. And the highlight of course is eating the delicious product at the end. We are back in Australia now with the special momo spices we brought back from Nepal and we will be trying to recreate the chicken momos with the recipe we were emailed after the event.

As my friend also has made a review of our trip, I'll keep this short with some additional info.We had booked a 2 day touring itinerary with Socialtours but due to the unexpected snowstorm we were forced to fly into Kathmandu instead of driving in from Tibet. We arrived 2 days in advance so had 2 extra days to spend in Nepal.Our original plan was to just stay in Kathmandu and Bhaktapur to tour all the historic sites but as we were \"monasteried\" from our week in Tibet, we decided to change our itinerary on the spot. Instead, we went for the 3-day Chitwan Jungle experience to add variety to our experience.Positive points- Despite our sudden appearance at their office, Raj was accommodating enough to suggest possible additions/changes, confirm our new itinerary and process the reservations needed. All on the spot during the height of tourist season and the itinerary started right away. That is what I call excellent service.- All agency people I have chatted with including Raj, were all straightforward with information. They will tell you the good points and the bad points. Even have suggestions on how to make the trip better and actually explain the whys of the suggestion. A real plus point as it provides as with insider info that we normally don't get from agencies. It's a more personalized service which I highly appreciate.- Value for money spent is well worth it. They may be a bit pricier than the other agencies I have contacted, though not by much, but the difference is the level and quality of the service. You are assured of the quality of the tour as we have experienced. Not one point of the tour failed to amuse or shower us with unforgettable experiences.Negative points- As pointed out by my friend, the driver failed to ensure the safety of our luggage from the rain. Our bags were water resistant but they just couldn't withstand that much downpour. I know this is not a fault of the agency but maybe a debriefing of the drivers would be beneficial.- The driver also stopped at a roadside store to have lunch. We chose to forego eating as we were assured lunch was waiting for us at the resort. Waiting for a bit was no problem for us but he ordered something that took around 45 minutes to cook. We practically wasted at least an hour of travel time.- During the advance wiring of fee settlements, it would be better for the agency representative to not only mention that there will be bank charges but to actually quote how much the charges will be from the Nepal Bank side. I had anticipated the bank charges but didn't exactly knowthe exact amount so the money that did get credited to the agency's account was lacking a few dollars, making for an inconvenient situation. I tried to settle the problem with a suggestion that the remaining be paid when we do get to Nepal to avoid another round of charges but didn't get a response in return. This kind of left all my preparations hanging as I was set to leave for Tibet by that time. I received no reply for 2 weeks until we arrived in Nepal and found out that the agent I was in contact with had taken her leave for the festival. A reply would have really been appreciated to ease the mind.Overall though, excellent service from Raj and Socialtours. Excellent tips too. Brigand's Bend was the best meal ever. The walk through the village in the searing Nepali midday heat was worth it because of the utterly delicious food. And the dawn tour at Bhaktapur was priceless. We would have never seen the \"slice of life\" scenes in just a normal day tour of the city. Highly recommended! Again and again!"

He was very accommodating, organized, well informed and flexible and finally arranged a traditional nepal dinner at a place, a tour to 2 day stay at chitwan, lunch stop at Brigand's Bend (where we had the best lunch) and then 1 day stay at Bhaktapur. Even with just limited time, socialtours was able to arrange the best of what nepal had to offer.The driver we had was very kind and chatty. The only negative thing I would think of was that he didn't have a cover for our bags which was placed on top of our rented car. With our weather luck, it rained so part of our bags got wet. Socialtours kept on calling us at each of our destination just to see how we are and if we needed anything.Their early morning Bhaktapur tour which started at 6:00 am was amazing. We started a bit late because the guide got in late. With that minor glitch aside, we got to see how the traditional people lived there. It was not just a tour of the temples but our guide took us off the beaten track. He even helped us pick presents to bring home.Overall, I am very satisfied with their service. There's still a lot I would like to visit in nepal and would definitely come back and get other tours with them."

Both were fantastic but we felt they could have done a full day course with dal bhat as well. Also it would have been useful to have the recipes to hand as we were working through them.Their enthusiastic volunteers were very helpful with suggestions of things to do in Kathmandu for the rest of their stay. Thank-you.I would definitely recommend this course."

We walk the streets and discover how local life is on a Saturday, their only weekend day. Woman doing the laundry or washing their children in basins. Drying chili, garlic and corn are everywhere, the same as dogs, goats, chickens, temples and smiles. We walk by several small workshops, everyone showing great artisan skills in woodcarving, sari making etc. The prices are ofc a lot cheaper than KTM, buying directly from the maker, and you wonder how they earn enough. We keep walking through and end up in another village, where we get to a restaurant that has already prepared a delicious Dal Bhat! Driving back towards KTM in a mini bus, we stop at a home for disabled children, talking to the founder and saying hello to the kids living there is strong. Outside 4 deaf girls has started a small coffee stand, called the \"Dharma Coffee shop\". With silence and efficiency they brew what you order (pointing to a menu). There is no set price, but if you want you can offer a donation inside a small Dharma woolen chicken. Filled with smiles we drove back to KTM, happy for a day that showed us the life of Nepali\u2019s living in Khokana and Bungamati.As I understand this trip changes which villages they visit to bring more back to the community, and therefore I might take another trip to see more. Well worth it !"

From the initial email correspondence to the end of the trip itself (and beyond) they were professional, friendly, eager to ensure they delivered what we required to an incredibly high standard and excellent value for money. We knew we wanted to do the Annapurna Sanctuary Trek and we knew roughly how many days we wanted to do it in, we also knew we wanted to spend some days in Kathmandu and also Pokhara chilling. We gave the brief to Socialtours and they put the package together for us organising all hotels, transfers, internal flights, guides, porters, Cultural Heritage Tour, Tea Houses and even welcome and farewell meals! We could not fault them on their choice of guide for our trek and we not only enjoyed the experience but learnt loads about Nepal, its geography, culture, religions, politics and heaps more in a very relaxed and friendly way from our Sherpa guide. The same must also be said of the Cultural Heritage Tour they organised for us round Kathmandu. We would definitely use them again and would recommend them without hesitation to anyone thinking of visiting Nepal for whatever reason and wants a reliable, professional, value for money and yet caring company to help them make the most from their trip. The fact that they are passionate about maximising the benefits and minimising the negatives of tourism for both tourist and the Nepalese people is an added bonus. Thank you so much Socialtours!"

We could not have picked a better organization, and our expectations for a hands-on, fun, and informative cooking class were met above and beyond what we had hoped for. The staff were incredibly kind, patient, and knowledgeable. Everyone we met at Social Tours took the time to connect with us and share in conversation about Nepali culture and conscious tourism. The momos we made were so delicious and a wonderful skill to take back to friends and family. If we had had more time before leaving Nepal we would have gone back to learn how to make dal bhat! We strongly recommend connecting with Social Tours and all the amazing programs they offer!"

As I just turned up I joined in with what the other girls wanted to do (Daal Bhat), which was fine. The two ladies who were teaching, one mostly cooking, one mostly explaining, were really friendly and knowledgeable (I actually saw them later on in town and they said hello with big smiles, which was lovely.)We went to the store to buy the ingredients, which I thought was a nice touch with other courses may not offer. The kitchen was clean, the only down side was the cooker is in the corner, this was fine as there was 3 of us, but I think if there were more people it may be hard to see whats going on. However, we discussed this (everyone was very open to how to improve) and they said they are planning to move the cooker to the centre (but also increase the class size). We were able to help prepare and cook. I think if you asked to be more involved you could or if you wanted a more passive role that was an option.It was good fun and very informative, with the recipes provided afterwards.

We had the opportunity to ask many questions, get stuck in with the chopping and dicing and of course with the eating at the end. I learnt a lot!

A great insight into Nepal and Kathmandu..and I would like to do some further activities with Social Tours, such as the village visit, when I return to KTM in 4 weeks. Highly recommended."

One of my favourite things about traveling is eating the local food and I love doing cooking classes so that I can take that food home with me!The 'Cook Like a Local' course is the best cooking course I've been to! Unlike other cooking classes they actually get you envolved in each step of the process from shopping for the vegetables, to cutting & mixing, to cooking and finally eating! The food was delicious & the kitchen was clean & hygenic.The staff were really friendly & made you feel comfortable straight away & were able to have a laugh with us when our momos looked like a 2 year old folded them. We went to the cooking class on my mum's last day visiting me in Nepal and, even though we had other plans, we ended up sitting with the staff & chatting after we ate.During my travels I lost my momo recipe & they emailed me another copy. Total champions!!!"

All our travel plans and where abouts were always tracked and good attention given to pick and drop facility.Overall we had a wonderful experience and we would be happy to recommend Nepal Social Treks to anybody and will specially do so in Pune, India within our friends circle.Hemant, Vinaya and Ninad"

She has this amazing ability to understand exactly what you are looking for in your holiday and how to accommodate that. I really cannot speak highly enough of the effort that she put in to make my visit memorable and smooth.

After some research we followed the TripAdvisor recommendations and contacted Nepal Social Trek via the contact details on their website. Ram and his wife Sajana made sure that we would feel welcome in Nepal, even before we arrived. The communication and arrangements beforehand went smooth prior to our arrival. Even our many questions and change requests to the itinerary were always dealt with immediately. From the pick-up at the airport to the drop-off a month later, everything was taken good care off by the people in Nepal Social Trek.We chose the more challenging and longer route to EBC via Gokyo and Chola-Pass, our guide Achut was the perfect companion, he made sure we stayed safe throughout the trek and that we get proper rest in the well-chosen hotels/tea houses. The trek via Gokyo is very beautiful and it\u2019s worth adding a few days more to the regular EBC trek. When we had to cross Chola Pass we were very unlucky with the weather, it started to snow heavily when we started to hike up the pass. The hike was very steep on ice and fresh snow, we were glad that Achut with his experience was not afraid and helped us to reach the top safely (he pulled us more or less up the pass). Going down over the glacier was not less scary, especially since we could not see a path, since we already trekked with Achut for many days we fully trusted in his abilities to get us safe through the ice field and the most dangerous portion of our trek.Achut knows the Khumbu region very well and has a lot of stories to share, which was very entertaining during the many hours on the trails. When our porter became sick (AMS) and we couldn\u2019t find a porter for hire in the mountains, Achut was willingly carrying our baggage for three days (luckily we packed light and only had 16kg together as a couple, and we loaded a few heavier items in our day-packs for that period). All in all we felt very well look after by Achut. I would recommend all trekker to hire a guide and a porter for the trek to EBC (no matter which route), as this ensures you don\u2019t have to worry about accommodation, heavy load on your back (we have seen many people suffering carrying all their luggage) and the days planning, but you can just enjoy the beauty of Khumbu.If we would do this trek again we would again book the tour package with Nepal Social Trek (which included all meals, the tea with the meal, accommodation, permits, flights KTM-Lukla-KTM, porter, guide) as it makes the trek less troublesome and we only needed to carry cash for any luxury we wanted in the mountains (for example cookies from an amazing bakery on Gokyo).After our return to Kathmandu from the lengthy and exhausting trek we stayed 3 nights in the city to relax and get used to civilization again :)Our Bhutan trip was also fully organized by Ram and Sajana, who briefed us with the details for the trip the day prior to the departure. Again we booked a package which included flights (KTM-Paro-KTM), accommodation, meals, guide, driver, permits and visas. Everything went very smooth in Bhutan, our guide (Mr. Namgay) and driver (Mr. Tobden) [as a foreigner it is required to be accompanied by a guide and a driver in Bhutan] picked us up from the airport and our cultural tour through beautiful Bhutan started immediately. Mr. Namgay and Mr. Tobden were dressed in the Bhutanese traditional dress Gho and welcomed us with the traditional Khata (Buddhist scarf, representing well-wished). Throughout our 4 days in Bhutan we were able to learn a lot about wonderful Bhutan and the Bhutanese people. This country is full of culture, Bhutan is certainly worth a visit. Although after 2 days of visiting fortresses, monasteries and temples it is very difficult to follow all the explanations of the statues and paintings throughout, but the beauty is still amazing. Ram and Sajana organized everything very well.Many thanks to all friends from Nepal Social Trek, we had a great time under your care :)"

They were exceptionally lovely people down to the very last--and I think we met most of the staff by the time it was all over. Overall I feel it was good value for money and I have exceptionally fond memories of all the guides we had along the way.I VERY MUCH want to give them 5 circles just because they're all so lovely, but I save 5s for perfection, and we had several small issues along the way--all of which were dealt with professionally and quickly. We were unhappy with 2 of the hotels they booked for us. That said, when we voiced our concerns, they booked us in new and BETTER hotels right away. When originally booking our tour, we had some communication issues and ended up 2 nights short on our itinerary. They bent over backward to fix this issue, and the last 2 days ended up our favorite days. At one point in the middle of our tour they changed our schedule without asking us first. It ended up a good change, and we were happy, but as a matter of policy it's better to ask people before changing their itinerary. AND NOW for the GOOD things. I really feel they are a wonderful group of very hard working individuals. They organized a wonderful birthday dinner for my father, and were AMAZING with my 2 kids. Recommendations for restaurants were all spot-on and we loved the guides they set us up with. The hotel they booked for us in Chitwan was amazing (and set the bar higher wrt our expectations elsewhere). They arranged for us to visit an orphanage and donate some items. Every staff member we had conversations with was caring and committed to charity work and social improvement. We were one of only a couple families with young children I saw the whole trip, and admittedly when you have young children your requirements for comfort and happiness are different from the foot-loose and fancy free backpacker crowd they normally cater towards. I'll cut them some slack in that regard. I recommend using NST for your vacation, just be very clear about comfort expectations if you're traveling with kids. Don't be afraid to tell them right away if you're not happy. They will do everything they can to fix it."

What an amazing journey - not easy mind you. I chose this company early in 2015 from the hundreds on the internet, based on reviews and a small leap of faith. We were not disappointed. I have no negative feedback from our trip. Before we left, I was in regular contact with them and had all my questions answered. From the time of arrival, the entire trip went smoothly and everything was super organized. Our guide Buddhi was very experienced and was able to help with cultural info, health assistance (we did get sick for a while) and really knew how to get us acclimatized so we could make it all the way. We needed a couple of extra days during our trip and this was no problem. Shawn Deep our porter was a top bloke too!! It was a trip of a lifetime, a dream of mine since I was a boy in fact, and I am so grateful to the entire team at Nepal Social Treks and Expeditions that they facilitated bringing my dream into reality. I sincerely thank you and I will be back."

Overall, I appreciate the fact that everything is well customized. I didn't use much of their service while in Kathmandu as I preferred upgrading to a better hotel and wandering around by myself. On the last day they arranged my airport transfer and they showed good attention by coming to my hotel to say goodbye in person.

The route that Ram, the business owner suggested was definitely not for beginners. Considering the fact that the mid-section of the trail was destroyed, I was lucky to come out of it with only a broken ankle. High altitude sickness, hypothermia, leech infestations, you name it. Not sure if I was in more physical or emotional pain, but I'd say it's an equally high amount of both. Nepal Social did not do their research for the area (post-Earthquake trail and weather conditions). No beginner trekkers should be out in the Gosainkunda-Suryakunda Path unless you're a landslide and torrential rain enthusiast, or if you're into traversing mountain sides with no safety gear and with no way of being medically evacuated.After the trek, we were supposed to go on a volunteering program. Ram made all sorts of promises but no surprise, he flaked on us as we waited for him the day he was supposed to pick us up and we had to look for other ways to hand out donations by ourselves. I remember thinking how ridiculous the whole ordeal was and how unbelievably unprofessional Nepal Social Treks conducted their business that no one back home could possibly believe us when we tell them what happened. I hope this will serve to give others an idea of what our experience was like. There are many other more honest and safe trekking companies in Nepal. I wouldn't in a million years consider NST as one of them. My ankle will eventually heal but the trauma and disappointment will stay in my memory for a very long time."

All itineraries and provisions were as per they promised in the quotation. Nepal Social is flexible to changes of itinerary with short notice e.g. changing from 2 Nites in Muktinah to 1 nite each in Muktinah & Pokhara. They also provided me for this trek the same guide that took me to Gokyo Ri in 2012. The guide is very patient, professional, responsible, jovious chap who speak very good English, and ensure I am happy & comfortable with all the tea-house accommodation at each village. All in all, a professional & responsible Trekking agent you can rely upon.It is a pity that there are so few trekkers, due apparently to negative news reporting of earthquake damages in April. The Annapurna/Pokhara are NOT at all damaged by the April earthquake. I hope more trekkers will visit Nepal to help the local villagers, who depend very much on tourism for their livelihood."

They forgot to pick us up at the airport, and we actually had to call to remind them. They came eventually, but much later. We were promised a decent hotel at Kathmandu based on the itinerary, but it transpired that that hotel was fully booked on the day we arrived. What puzzled me was why didn't they book the hotel for us in advance, because we certainly booked our trip earlier and paid them in advance. Anyway, they checked us into a terrible hotel at the last minute. No apology was given for that as well, since they were pretty much trying to tell us that both hotels were about the same. It's definitely not, just like a two star hotel is different from a four star one. Let's talk about the tours next. Everyday was like a mystery. You really learn to be patient there. When we asked our guide what was going to happen tomorrow and what time to wait etc, their typical response was I'd let you know. And they wouldn't let us know till it was late into the night, because they changed guides for us everyday and each guide wouldn't know what was on tomorrow. Good way to earn more tips for the guides, I get it. At least one driver didn't know where to take us even (because the guide left earlier), and had to rely on us to tell him. We could only hazard a guess, and thank god we were right! Because it meant that the hotel they were meant to book for us was booked! We actually cheered there and then, which pretty much tells you how low our expectations for them were at that point. Ok, now the good about them. A few of the guides were knowledgeable and had good attitude. The itinerary in Nepal was fun and well planned, and the entire trip was reasonably priced. Nepal is beautiful, exotic and interesting, and really a country worth visiting! We also booked a trip to Tibet through them, and it was bad as well. They arranged hotels with no attached toilet or shower facilities for us, even though we specifically asked and confirmed with them that all our rooms would have such facilities. The Tibet part was expensive as well, which led us to think they probably gave themselves too much commission. On the upside, the guide and driver in Tibet were sincere and quite good. Overall, this agency definitely does not deserve such good ratings on trips adviser. Buyers beware, I suspect that not all that you read here is true."

We did the Three High Pass trek with our guide Achut (R2 to us!) and our Porter Kaloo in mid December. It was really important to me when searching this trip that we went with a local company and with a company that treated their guides well. I cant even begin to put into words how amazing Achut was and I truly do believe he was the reason why our trip was such a success. He always made sure we were doing well and feeling good. He took the time to show us animals, vegetation, and to talk about culture. We had numerous games of cards, had many laughs, and danced to stay warm at 5550 meters while watching the sunset on everest. He treated our porter like his best friend and although the language barrier prevented us from conversing with Kaloo\u2026 we still shared many laughs with him along the way. Basu the owner was easy to work with when setting up the trip. Our pick up was great, our hotels were great, and our city tour that was included was awesome. Our city guide was very knowledgable and a pleasure to spend the day with. Our final dinner with Basu was a great way to end our trip. Not only did we get a better chance to get to know Basu, but it was also cultural dance and dinner show to send us off. From our experience, this company was a great choice. Thank you Nepal Social for the trip and especially to Achut for sharing with us in such an amazing Himalayan adventure!"

We always enjoyed impeccable service, from pickup, to the hotels, to the trek itself. However, the best thing about this company is their down-to-earth, attentive and friendly staff. Basu, with whom we liaised over email with from Australia, had great English and organised everything without hassle, then helped us from day one when we arrived in Kathmandu, took us out for dinner, met with us regularly to discuss the trek and organised other tours to Chitwan National Park (must do!!) for us. Our guides Bishnu and Shisir were beautiful souls. They took note of our fitness levels and altered pace to suit us, always made sure we were comfortable, helped us with any problem we had and made us laugh alot.

I also visited Pokhara, it\u2019s a very nice city to spend two days, there is a lot of activities to do there and there is a wide variety of restaurants, Chitwan (I highly recommend the bath with the elephants) and of course Katmandu (you should spend there at least 2 days). Two things I would remark from Nepal Social Treks, the flexibility to change the itinerary during the trip and the excellent personal treatment."

Further more, RAM has planned for us an amazing route, over 20Days on trek, we covered Three High Pass ( Renjo-La , Cho-La , Kongma-La ), Kala Patthar, Everest Base Camp and Island Peak.RAM pickup us at Kathmandu Airport when arrival, treat us welcome lunch and farewell dinner, arranged City Tour for us after back from Trek, we even having beer and wine session at rooftop of the hotel, and having a great chat :) During the trek, our guide BUDDHI is helpful, before start the trek , he will explain to us the detail of the trek later, so that we have some basic idea of the trek, example like how many meters ascending/descending, estimate duration, rocky route etc .... Company also arrange 3 porters for us, porters Lapar, Mingma, Sundi, are reliable, they arrived Tea House early , and put our luggage nicely into our room as well as our sleeping beg.We had a great time at Nepal~~~~"

Our domestic flights to Lukla were cancelled due to bad weather and we were disheartened. Most in our tour group had work commitments and we could not afford to spend more time waiting for a flight to Lukla. We decided to just head to Annapurna Base Camp instead. Basu and the entire team of guides and porters were awesome hosts and they accommodated to our last minute change in plans. During the hike, the guides put our safety ahead of everything else and they went through the trouble of carrying extended loads when some of us fell sick or got injured. They were great company to have during the trek. It was a wonderful experience overall and we were glad that we used Nepal Social Treks. We will definitely use them again for any future trips to Nepal."

Basu went out of his way to make us feel at home and comfortable throughout our whole time in Nepal, not just on our trek with him. All of the guides speak extremely good English and most likely another language as well, are very knowledgable, and make the treks very enjoyable because if their company. I believe that i left Nepal with some longtime friends because of Nepal Social. I would not recommend any other organization to anybody except Nepal Social. Every penny is well spent with Basu and his team. I most definitely plan to return to Nepal and book with Nepal social a few more times! They truly made my whole experience in Nepal unforgettable.

The teahouses were great with really nice food and we met fantastic people en route. Nepal is a stunning country - I read you go for the mountains and return for the people and it so so true.

My experience with Nepal Social is that they are your friend above all else. While professional, the relationship I had with the office staff and guides felt really personable. They are my friends, not just a trekking company. Other guides that I observed seemed to be more distant, acting just as that: a guide. The guys at Nepal Social really make an effort to be your friend. They will let you drink tea in the office and will help you with anything you need, from visas, to money exchange, to buying trekking gear, shipping packages, etc. They are also really flexible to work with you to make your trip what you want. As I was signing up for the 3 high passes trek, they told me I could decide later to add Island Peak or Jiri. They take good care of you and will do everything they can to accommodate you and your needs. I can't talk them up enough and confidently recommend them."

First, I would like to say that the Everest Base Camp trek is a spectacular and rewarding experience among the highest mountains in the world. It is impossible to capture the scale and grandeur of this region with either words or photos. If you have the desire and ability, please go see it yourself.Nepal Social Treks was my choice for a tour operator. I am pleased and fortunate with my choice. I can't imagine a more competent and accomodating organization. Other reviewers have praised Ram and Basu and the team. I would like to give Nirijan and my guide Buddhi Lama special credit and thanks. Nirijan got me there, Buddhi got me home.I am 63. I have trekked in the Andes and other ranges. I am in good shape and active, but also very aware of the inherent risks of climbing to high altitudes. And, in spite of taking numerous precautions I was stopped at 5000 meters, about 1 day from base camp, by cerebral edema. This is uncommon, but dangerous. So I want to focus my review on how Nepal Social Treks handled this situation.As soon as my symptoms began, our guide Buddhi began to observe me for all signs of altitude sickness. He has received special training in altitude sickness and mountain first aid. When it was clear that I had a problem, I was directed down the mountain accompanied by Dipesh Kulung, a sherpa who knew all trails and conditions on the mountain. My group continued to EBC, and we planned to meet again at a lower altitude. Dipesh guided me, took all of my gear, and attended to all of my food and water needs. He was patient and very helpful. After two days of trekking down, my conditions had not improved. This is when Nepal Social made a very coordinated effort to provide me with immediate care, and remove me from the mountain. Buddhi was dispatched from the rest of the group to my location, even though his steep climb down was during the dark night. He coordinated the local resources that were available in this village. Nirijan worked tirelessly from Kathmandu to coordinate my emergency contacts, my insurance company, and a helicopter ride out. This was clearly a procedure they had already worked out. It was a long night on oxygen for me, but by early the next morning the helicopter arrived. I was shocked to see that Basu himself had flown out with the pilot to take over my care from that point on. He delivered me to the hospital, and remained there until I was cleared by the doctor. I believe that the company's response could not have been any better. They also coordinated all of the documentation required for the insurance payments.In spite of the problem with altitude sickness, I loved my trek. I plan to go back to the Annapurna region someday (but stay below 5000m). And I will most definitely use Nepal Social Treks again!"

Basu and Ram are great people, they look after us from day one and still kept connected after the trip. they really know about costumer services and we had great guides and porters during the Trek!because me and my friend did not had the time to research and organised the whole trip in Nepal (3 weeks) Basu and Ram did it all for us ! We did rafting in the river and and a jungle safari ... they were very flexible to change our plan if we need it. Recommend this trek company, specially if you like to leave a little something back to Nepal ... as part of the profit goes to an Orphanage in Kathmandu ( which you also visit during your trip!)best success to you guys !Mimi - Everest base camp & yoga trek April 2013"

I'm a bit delayed as I did the tour in April but I finally got a chance to sit down and write something now.I completed the Annapurna Circuit mid-April, 2013 and I couldn't have asked for a better time. My guide, Bishnu, and my porter, Kamal, were both wonderful and made me feel at ease even though I was completely on my own as no one else ended up joining the tour! I was a bit nervous that I would be the only one on the tour but it ended up being such a fantastic time with such great people! Bishnu was wonderful and really took care of everything - the food was wonderful, all of the people we met were amazing and the tea houses we stayed in were friendly, clean and comfortable. I didn't really know what I was signing up for before I got to Nepal because the circuit was probably the most challenging thing I've ever done in my life. Each day was like a new adventure - the geography, climate, villages, and people changed so much so I felt like I was in a different world every day. Even though I was on my own in the tour, because so many other people were doing the trek, we ended up meeting people at the teahouses to hang out with, drink some beers and play cards with at night. It was such a blast after long days of trekking!Bishnu was absolutely perfect too - we could spend hours talking about whatever was on our minds whilst we were trekking, but we could also just shut up and enjoy the beauty and the entire experience. He was very kind and caring and was never condescending or pushy, even when I wanted to give up and not take another step towards Thorung-La! Everything went without a hitch (other than me losing my iPhone and dropping my camera in a commode but whatever) and I couldn't have asked for a better time :). I am so happy that I researched Nepal Social Treks on tripadvisor prior to coming to Nepal because it really took all of the stress of travelling alone out of the holiday. It may be a bit more expensive than if you take matters in to your own hands and wait until you get to Kathmandu to book a tour, but you never really know what you're going to get with other companies. Plus, Nirajan picked me up from the airport and took me to my hotel which is essential when you're jetlagged and have no idea where you're going. He was also good about being in contact with me before the tour and giving me good advice on how to best prepare and pack before I arrived. I couldn't have asked for a better experience and I really want to promote this tour as well as Bishnu because he was such an incredible guide. You will not regret this experience!!!"

Ram, Basu, and the entire team at Nepal Social were amazingly helpful and accommodating when arranging the trek for us. When we arrived in Nepal, we were promptly picked up at the airport and brought to the hotel. They set us up with an amazing guide, Kumar, and two awesome porters Mani and Robin. Kumar was an exceptionally professional guide who had amazing knowledge of the region. The trek could not have been more perfect. On the last day when we were to reach Kala Patthar, the view was out of this world. We have never seen such a grand spectacle. My father and I would like to really thank Kumar, Mani, and Robin for their help. We couldn't have done it without them. After the trek, we wanted to unwind so Ram and Basu quickly arranged a perfect trip to Pokhara which was the perfect way to spend our last few days in Nepal before flying more. If your ever looking for an adventure, Nepal Social Treks is by far the best choice. It is an amazing company run by incredible people. Thank you Nepal Social for an unforgettable experience."

It\u2019s as much of a mental challenge to hike up in that altitude as it is a physical. Furthermore, the trek helped raise money for Nepal\u2019s Orphans Home. We did get the opportunity to go there, hear the stories about how the children came to the home, and also how there are thousands of others who need a home like NOH. It means a lot to be able to somehow contribute to the local and meaningful issues. Every child deserves a chance."

First, a shout out to Basu, Ram, Nirajan, Buddhi, Dipesh,the porters and the rest of the staff at Nepal Social Treks for the job well done that made our EBC trek last April 7-21 a great success. Thank you so much!I've known Nepal Social Trek online as recommended by a blogger. Months before the trek, I've been exchanging tons of emails with Nirajan inquiring anything about EBC trekking. Promptness in responding to my inquiries is one of the things that i like in this company. Nirajan is always there online 24/7. The thing that i like the most in this company is their being service oriented. They took care of us since the day we arrived in Kathmandu to the day they send as off to the airport. They know what we need need and they provide it. Just excellent! In fact, Basu personally flew to pick one of my companion who is forced to go down due to altitude sickness. It was a sad thing that not all of my group made it to the base camp, but he was taking cared off well.P.S. If you are first timer to do EBC trek, I would recommend to hire a guide/trekking company. There are people out there that says EBC route is pretty easy and doing it alone is fine as long as you can read maps and etc. They maybe right, but I've been there. It's not that easy. It's totally not a walk in the park. So, hire a guide or use Nepal Social Treks to help you realize your EBC dream especially if you're first timer!"

I booked two trips with Nepal Social Treks and I was more than just satisfied with them organizing both of my adventures in Nepal.The owners Ram (Rara Lake Trek) and Basu (Ganesh Himal, Manaslu Circuit and Tsum Valley Trek) and also the whole Nepal Social Treks staff were more than eager to fully fulfill my/our expectations of the two treks. Since I was/ we were specifically looking for the \u201coff the beaten track\u201d experience, they especially tailored the treks to my/our individual needs and expectations! No additional effort was too much for Nepal Social Treks - I really appreciated the extra miles they went for making my adventure in Nepal so unique and unforgettable.My first trek took me to the Rara Lake Region with a small detour in Bardia National Park (total of 3 weeks). At first, I didn\u2019t have a traveling partner so the company posted my travel plans on their twitter and facebook page to find me a companion. The trek was led by Kumar, a guide who truly loves his job. During the trek we changed our itinerary constantly and Kumar was more than happy to give us some insider information for some small detours or side trips. The two porters and Kumar tried and succeeded to make our trek unique and unforgettable and my trekking partner and I are forever thankful for this amazing experience!My second trek was in the Ganesh Himal Region with the Manaslu Circuit and the Tsum Valley in addition (total of 4 weeks). Nepal Social Treks organized my previous guide Kumar for this trek, which I was really grateful for. During the trek Kumar helped us organize a couple of detours on the Ganesh Himal Region Trek and the Manaslu Circuit. The Tsum Valley itinerary got totally changed too to fit the individual interests of all the trekking tour members. The group constellation was sadly really bad (100 % my fault: I had organized my trekking companions throughout a trekking website) and a real challenge for not only me but especially Kumar. Our guide Kumar took on the challenge of this group and perfectly managed to make this adventure an unforgettable and fun trekking trip \u2013 for not only me but for the whole group!I would \u2013 without hesitation - recommend Nepal Social Treks to my family and all of my friends or people asking me for advice concerning traveling in Nepal.

We were met at the airport when we arrived from Australia, taken to a great hotel for the night.

This was proven when my girlfriend got Altitude sickness and we had to decend to Namchee Bazaar. I was worried this would be the end of the trek. Our guide rearranged our itinerary. Once we were ready to start trekking again we went up a different valley caught up to close to where we had left off and continued on with a very enjoyable trek missing next to nothing. Nothing was to much trouble( thanks Buddhi). Everything that was promised and more was delivered, making our trek so much more enjoyable. Ive done quite a few organised trips and treks and i have to say the service and eye for detail delived from Nepal Social Trek was first class. Nepal Social Trek also donate part of your trekking fees to local charities, so i like the idea of this as well.

While we initially were apprehensive about dealing with a company through the internet, on the other side of the world, from start to finish they were spectacular. EVERYTHING WAS AS ADVERTISED, AND NOTHING FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS!!!During the planning stage, Ram was incredibly professional and responsive to our needs. It was just the two of us travelling, and after listening to what we wanted, He set up the most amazing private adventure. He took care of every detail, and made sure we got to see everything on our list in an orderly and expeditious fashion. He responded very quickly to our emails and questions.Our visit included a Kathmandu tour, a short Trek in the Pokhara area, visiting Chitwan, and finishing with a morning view of Mount Everest from Nagarkot.The guide for the majority of our trip was Bishnu. We can\u2019t say enough good things about him. He went way above and beyond our expectations. He was very attentive, and anticipated our needs, often before we knew they existed!!! He took responsibility to keep us safe with plenty of bottled water and safe food. We didn\u2019t have any stomach issues at all.In Chitwan, our guide was Saroj. He also is a very talented guide, who went way above and beyond in providing us with a great experience. His knowledge of the jungle and ability to safely guide us close to many wild animals was greatly appreciated.Nirajan works behind the scenes coordinating many of the travel details. In the middle of our trip, in an effort to maximize our time in Nagarkot, we requested he rearrange our flight (move it up by 4 hours) from Chitwan to Kathmandu. This was no small task during peak season, and he rose to the challenge and accomplished it quickly and professionally. Wow! We were impressed!The final day, Ram called and invited us to lunch, where he made sure everything had gone well. It was a classy finishing touch.In summary, Nepal Social Treks is a great company that treated us with incredible care. We highly recommend them."

I would like to deliver my deep appreciation and much love to Nepal Social, especially Basu and Ram here once again. I would strongly recommend Nepal Social if you think of trekking in Nepal."

Our experience of trekking with them surpassed all our expectations. They organised an 8 day private trek for 3 peope for us to Annapurna Base Camp. Achut Panday, our guide managed a great balance of spending time with us and giving us enough privacy. He was always attentive and dealt with the inevitable hassles of the mountains efficiently and unobtrusively. He catered to our needs-even the unreasonable ones- with a smile. The little treats like fresh or tinned fruit he produced daily were unexpected and welcomed. He managed the porters (a team of three pleasant and helpful guys) extremely well. Ram Barakoti and Bassu Panday, the directors of the company are incredibly customer focused and are available and responsive literally 24/7. We live in Asia and travel extensively in the region and Nepal Social Treks are the best we have encountered: friendly, customer focused, exceed expectations at every step and value for money. We will be using them again and highly recommend their services."

            "review": "Amazing Trekking Company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Number 1 in Nepal. From start to finish we have had the most amazing experience with Nepal Social Treks and Expeditions. As first time trekkers we had absolutely no idea about anything (literally we had never even worn hiking boots before!!) And as you can imagine from searching the internet there are thousands of Trekking companies!! How to choose which one?The moment we were in contact with Nepal Social Treks they gave us all the attention we needed and they were happy to answer any questions we had! (Even the silly ones!) That in itself gave us confidence that we chose the right company; we checked Trip Advisor and all reviews were at high standard- they were all right!As we arrived at the airport, we were greeted by the lovely smiling Basu, with a lei of flowers and our names clearly written on a board amongst the 100\u2019s of men waiting! (It can be quite confronting if you have never been to Nepal!) Basu was fluent in English and made us feel so welcome to Nepal- even joking about the traffic and cars as I think he could see we were a little shell shocked! Hotel; they arranged our hotel for us which again saved us time searching the area! (Moonlight and Travellers INN): Moonlight: nice outdoor area, breakfast included and your basic hotel needs with hot water. Travellers Inn: comfy beds, basic hotel needs \u2013 perfect for all Trekkers! If for any reason your plane is delayed or your trek has been moved, there is no cost to cancel or change the dates; they will do it for you.The first night Basu and few of the lovely staff showed us around the lively Thamel area. They took us out for a welcome dinner at Third Eye Restaurant- quality traditional food!! It\u2019s nice to have a local show you the sites and all the hidden gems! We actually had a few nights before our trek and were shown so many unseen restaurants and bars, that as a first timer you could easily miss! 0K2K, New Orleans Caf\u00e9, Bamboo Restaurant \u2026 all great for a wine , food ATMOSPHERE and CHEAP! During the days we were taken site seeing to all the major tourist attractions with our tour guide that was going to take us up to Mt Everest Base Camp.. Dill Gurung\u2013 we spent 2 days site seeing with Dill which gave us a chance to run through everything about the trek and also a chance to get to know our guide; We also needed to hire jackets and they took us to a place and helped us find what we needed!! Which saved us so much hassle (as there are soooo many places). By this time our expectations where met far and beyond what we had ever expected!!!! And we hadn\u2019t even started the TREK! The Trek: from the flight/ kits they packed/ first Aid/ trekking gear, all of it was fabulous! Sleeping bag was warm, they had everything we needed in the first aid and some! Our tour guide - Dill was truly the kindest person and guide we have ever met! Even though Dill has been trekking to Base Camp for over 7 years, he made our first time just as special! Explained in detail about where we were going, how long it would take, rest days, food, you name it, and it was covered! It was also peak season, which meant busy tea houses! Dill would ring ahead to make sure our room was ready (even with blankets!). We would play cards each night and he would make us feel happy EVEN if one of us was feeling tired or sick. Dill would do everything possible to make sure we were comfortable! Our porter Lila: we are still amazed at how much they can carry! Wow wee!! Lila made sure our bags were ready before we even reached the Tea houses! How that is even possible, I have no idea?? short cut?? But he managed every time to be waiting with our room key upon arrival at the tea houses! He would also ask if we wanted a tea, and would join in with our evening card games and turned out to be quite the comedian!!After we got back from Everest Base Camp we were greeted by Basu and Ram his business partner, who welcomed us back with t-shirts and tea! The office feels like a second home, Basu and Ram make sure all their clients are well looked after and if you need anything they will help in anyway they can! Truly incredible peopleTo sum this all up; after meeting and speaking to fellow trekkers they were amazed at the service we received and the quality for money! Our experience in Nepal would not have been the same without Basu and the team at Nepal Social Treks! We will go back again and again and would highly recommend to all our friends/family and random people! So if you\u2019re thinking of heading to beautiful Nepal and want some adventure or even just a few days of sightseeing Basu and Ram at Nepal Social Treks will organise anything for you!Happy Travels and hope this has helped!!Kelly and Sherri Green"

We were first introduced to Ram and Basu via our Volunteer company, from the first email 2 months before our arrival in Kathmandu right through to our last day, the attentative service and help we received was second to none.We pretty much had a shopping list of things we wanted to cover during our time in Nepal. Having spoken to Ram he assured me that they would be able to look after 'everything' for us. True to form, emails were replied without delay and once we finally decided what we wanted to do the cost was reasonable to say the least.Such was their offering, that we booked our Annapurna trek; return flights to Pokhara; hotel in Pokhara and airport transfers with them and could not have been any happier. Unfortunately we had some last minute change of plans (due to ill health), Ram made sure that we were comfortable and the changes that he made to our itinerary were seamless. Ram and Basu were responsive very friendly and helpful infact they couldn't do enough for us.To sum it up, what a great professionally run company coupled with such humble, helpful and down to earth people. We're already thinking of when we can return back to Nepal, whenever that may be, Nepal Social Trek will be the first people we call!Well Done Ram and Basu and Thank You for making our trip a memorable one!"

The scenery was out of this world and our guide (Dil Gurung) was exceptional. We knew we were in good hands - he knew so much about the trekking regions and he always made sure that we were in good health and well looked after in the lodges. We had great fun on the trek and by the end of it all, we really felt like Dil was a close friend. I could say so much more but rest assured, if you decide to book with Nepal Social Treks I'm confident that you will have a fantastic trek and an experience to remember. P.S. Make sure to ask for Dil as your guide as he really is the best guide that we encountered on our 5 months of travelling! We hope to return to Nepal some day and we will definitely be trekking with these guys if we get back there."

As someone from the US I can say that Nepal Social Treks and Tours is the best of the best. I would not work with any other trekking company besides them. They are accommodating, polite, and easy to work with. They are always extremely flexible, and are willing to go the extra mile to make your trip exactly how you want it. In 2010 I did a wildlife safari tour with Nepal Social Treks with my fiance. The tour was held at Chitwan National Park which is approximately 4 hours from Kathmandu by car. Every part of our trip was organized ahead of time and we always felt extremely safe. Day two we spent the day on the back of an elephant for our elephant safari throughout Chitwan National Park. It was truly a wonderful experience, and I would recommend Chitwan to both families and couples, especially during the peak season. The Elephant Breeding Center, which was included as a part of our tour, was another one of our favorites. We traveled in a small canoe across a river to the center, and spent several hours interacting with the elephants in a very natural habitat.The trip was relaxing and a lot of fun, all because of the hard work of our friends at Nepal Social Treks.In 2011 when I returned to Nepal my fiance and I went on a trek to the Annapurnas. This was by far one of the most beautiful treks that we have ever been on. From the Annapurnas we could see the Tibetan mountain ranges. I definitely recommend the Annapurna circuit because of the scenic views that you can find no where else in the world, but also because of the interactions we had with the Nepali people on the trip. It was always a positive experience for me and my fiance, and we enjoyed our village visits so much, that we hope to do the same trek again soon! Nepal Social Treks set up the trip for us with one of their best guides, Basu. Afterwords, Ram Barakoti, from Nepal Social Treks, even helped us to organize our trip to India.  Ram and Basu dai are unique to the trekking industry. I have not found anyone else in Nepal who works as hard as they do to make your trip an enjoyable and successful one. Their experience in the industry is phenomenal! Hope you will consider working with them on your next trip to Nepal for all of your travel and trekking needs!"

I had heard of Nepal Social Treks and decided to reach out to them. I was traveling alone and wanted to make sure I was safe.From the very first communication, Basu Panday was incredibly knowledgeable and professional. He took care of every detail, from picking me up at the airport, booking all my hotels, taking care of my meals and even helping me customize my itinerary so that I could get the most of the time I spent in Nepal. He and his business partner Ram are experts in Nepal tourism and really listen to their customers needs. His suggestions for places to see and temples to visit were well thought out, and made my trip one of the most memorable trips of my life.I would recommend Nepal social treks to anyone traveling to Nepal. I am now planning my next trip which will be much longer!!"

My boyfriend, friend, and I planned to do the Annapurna Circuit, starting at the end of November and finishing mid december. This is the tail end of the treking season in Nepal, so we knew that accomodations wouldn't be a problem along the trail. We kept going back and forth about whether or not to get a guide or go with a tour company, but ultimately decided our trip would be less stressful with a guide and also create a better dynamic for the three of us. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM WE MADE THIS CHOICE! My friend had done Everest Base Camp with Nepal Social Treks last year, and she had a great experience, so we decided to visit their office and have a chat. We got a really good vibe from the owner Ram. Although a businessman, he was not manipulative or pushy, and I knew he felt confident and passionate about what his company/guides/porters offer even in the first 5 mins of chatting. We decided to just have a guide and not a porter, and signed up for a 19 day trek with a great guide named Naba. I can't say enough wonderful things about Naba. He was very professional, spoke English very well and supposedly knew 5 other languages too. Not only was Naba professional, but he was also a man of good character and fun to be around. This is important if you're spending 19 days hiking with someone! He knew every mountain from every angle and could tell us the elevation them all. The trek can be physically challenging for some, so it was wonderful wandering into a village and knowing exactly where to stay. Naba would walk into a lodge or tea house, grab keys, and within minutes, we were enjoying hot tea and a place to rest. I'm so glad I didn't have to bring loads of cash along with me to pull out every day for meals and accomodations!! With an all inclusive package, you really just focus on the treking, the scenery, and at the end of the day, you can rest without any stress. When you're in a group or with your partner/friend/sibling, it's nice to have a guide to create a better dynamic, eliminate stress on the trek, and give great cultural insight as you pass through villages. Nepal Social Treks went above and beyond by making arrangements for hotels on either end of our trip, purchasing all of our permits for treking, arranging our transportation back from Pokhara, giving us t-shirts, and they even offered us a ride to the airport a week after our trek when we were leaving Nepal. Although our trek had ended, Naba came and met us at the bus stop in Kathmandu and walked us back to Thamel (after a few days of rest in Pokhara). While on the trek, we met many guides and porters, who were traveling with other tourists like ourselves. I'm sure there are some other great companies in KTM, but we felt so lucky the entire time to have gotten Naba. He just seemed a step above the rest! I recommend Nepal Social Treks very highly! If I did it again, I'd probably get a porter though. Not having one really didn't reduce the price very much, and I think I would have had a more enjoyable time. That's just me though.. Definitely get a guide!"

Their suggestions are based on their love and knowledge of the areas, both in and out of Nepal. They love what they do and it shows.

It turned out to be the best decision on made about my trip to Nepal. There were about 10 people in my group. From the moment we arrived in Kathmandu till the day we were dropped off at the airport, Nepal Social Trek staff cared for us, fed us, made sure we are comfortable . We stayed in the best accommodations available and could have unlimited amount of food. For the price they charge, it is a VERY good deal. Also, all staff speak English, which is a big plus if you are traveling in a foreign country. There were always at least two guides with us. One always staying with the person who was the slowest, no matter how slow they were (no i was not that person:)) If i get the chance to go back to beautiful Nepal, i will give Nepal Social Trek a call and would not even consider any other travel agency."

Our package included 12 days with guide and a porter (one porter for both our backpacks) and included all meals and accommodation. We weren't sure at first if we needed guides but found our guide indispensable. Taking a porter allows you to walk in comfort and taking a guide meant that we did not once have to worry about getting a bed at the next tea house, misjudging walking times or any aspect of our general safety.We allowed 12 days for the return journey, stressing that we wanted to walk at our own pace but found that we got to the top much sooner than expected. Our ever-flexible team suggested an extension to the return leg via Poon hill and it was arranged there and then. As we still had a day to play with after Poon hill and expressed an interest in rafting, all it took was one call and it was arranged. The company has preferred hotels - hotel Moonlight in Kathmandu and Hotel Kantipur in Pokhara. We found both of these hotels to be solid mid-range options and have no complaints. We were looked after from start to finish and felt like they couldn't do enough for us. As a travelling companion we found our experienced guide (KB) to be a fount of knowledge on all things and was matched by an inexhaustible good humour."

Unfortunately due to weather conditions we had to cancel this and did the Anna Purna circuit / Thorong La Pass but Ram and Basu catered for this excellently. From the airport pickup, they waited nearly 3 hours as there were huge queues for visa's to organising the itinerary they were very profressional. I can't say enough about our guide Dil Gurung, he was extremely professional and looked after everything very well. He has been with NST for 5 years and has done both Base Camp and Anna Purna many times and is very familiar with the guesthouses and always chose somewhere good to stay. All in all if you are interested in doing some trekking in Nepal I can only recommend Ram, Basu and Dil to look after your needs."

I arranged a trip schedule with Nepal Social Treks and Tours prior to arriving in Nepal from the UK for an excellent price. Once I arrived with my son, we were met at Kathmandu airport and taken to the Moonlight Hotel, where we met Ram Barakoti a director of the company to run through our schedule and see if we wanted to change any aspect of the trek, which I thought was a lovely personal touch.We flew to Lukla with our guide, Dawa Sherpa early the next morning and began a wonderful journey to E.B.C. and Kala Pattar. Nothing was too much trouble for Dawa, he was a fantastic guide with great knowledge of the region, and his experience of trekking and mountaineering was second to none as his three successful Everest summit expeditions would suggest.Even while we were trekking the schedue was changed to suit our needs, we had pre-arranged a 12 day trek, but due to forecasted bad weather arriving, Dawa suggested we got back to Lukla one day sooner to ensure we could fly back to Kathmandu, and have plenty of time to get back to the Uk. Thankfully, we did as Dawa suggested, he changed our flights seamlessly and we got back to Kathmandu early, the following day all flights to and from Lukla were cancelled for 4 days!!!Back in Kathmandu early, we met Ram again and he organised a tour of the temple sights of the Kathmandu valley region, a trip to Nagarkot and an extra night stay in Kathmandu for us. I would like to conclude by stating that I would recommend Nepal Social Treks and Tours very highly for a professionally run company that gave Ben and myself a most wonderful adventure in Nepal without us having to stress about any arrangements, they were all taken care of."

This was reallly my first and most memorable time in mountain that I have ever had. During the 2 nites in mountain, I was arranged to stay in the BEST guesthouse in the region which really impressed me. Though hot water supply, lighting over mountain do not come easy, I did appreciate the hostpitality and the nice arrangement very much. As for the meals, because I have full autonomy to pick my own dishes, so I did have a great time tasing all Nepalese and western dishes even up to the mountain . and among all others, I was so happy to be well taken care of my an experienced and friendly guide who was ready to provide instant help whenever needed. Becos of all these credit of the company, I'm pretty proud and comfortable recommending it to my friends who r planning to spend some days in Nepal. Surely, they'll get more than what they expected"

I cannot really add much more to what has already been said - i have pasted in below my story if you are interested but basically for all things to do in Nepal I thouroughly reccomend Nepal Social, they are a fantastic team!! Not only great service at a reasonable price but they also have a social conscience and put back into the community - it was really a wonderful thing to experience.***In a nutshell I can not recommend Nepal Social highly enough. If you are travelling to Nepal these are the guys to see. Their service is amazing. My husband and I are quite experienced travellers having backpacked through 60 countries on every continent (excluding Antarctica!) and found the guys at Nepal Social to be probably the most friendly, non pushy outfit that we have ever dealt with. One day after arriving in Nepal in March this year we received news from home of a death in the family which meant we had to cut our trip short. Still want to experience a little of what Nepal has to offer we decided to undertake the 3 day Poon Hill trek in the Annapurna region. We visited Nepal Social offices after 5pm that afternoon and by 7am the next morning we were in a car on our way to the airport with NS having arranged everything for us - a fantastic English speaking guide (KB, an absolute legend!) permits, flights, car transfers either side, accommodation in Pokhara upon our return - it was seamless, there was not one thing we needed to worry about. They even helped us get gear for the trip later that evening at very reasonable prices. From the minute we walked in there we had nothing more to arrange or organise, and it was all done quickly, to a high service and very reasonable price.Our guide KB was fantastic, very knowledgeable and generous with us in talking about life in Nepal. We had planned on only doing a three day trek however when we got out to the start of the trail he talked us through the different options we had and was confident that with adjusting the Ghadruk - Gorepani Poon Hill Trek slightly (taking the reverse route) and adding a few extra hours a day if we were up for it we could do the 6 day trek in 3.The trek was wonderful and even though we walked a few extra hours I never felt rushed, we just took our time and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The tea houses we stayed at were all wonderful and the hospitality fantastic, food lovely.When we finished the trek Nepal Social arranged for our fights back to Kathmandu, picked us up at the airport, arranged for an everest flight and flights to Bangkok so we could get home for the funeral in time. They arranged all this without us paying - we had already taken the flight from Pokhara to Kathmandu without even having paid for it until we returned to Kath... talk about putting trust in people!!On our last night in Kathmandu Basu and Ram took us out to dinner which was a wonderful end to our trip - they talked about the 'social' side of their business i.e. the different charities and causes they are invovled with and support and i think this is what makes NS really stand out from the crowd - they are hard working local guys who truly give back to the community.We had such a great experience ourselves and two friends are planning on returning next year to undertake the base camp trek with Nepal Social."

My first trip to NEPAL was 11 years with my Best Friend (Nachman Etstien) in which we did the Langtang & Helambu Trek. A year after we did the Jomsom Trek from Pokhara to Muktinath. We did those treks solo (Without Porters) using some local agents to get basic services (Trek permits, Flights, Ground Transportation) \u2013 nothing was exceptional regarding the services. This year (SEP 2011) we decided to do the Annapurna Circuit from Besi Shar to Jomsom. This time my brother (Roni) joined us. We did it again solo except from Roni, who passed a surgery and needed a porter. For this trip (after making a detailed research) I selected NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS as our agents for the basic services \u2013 Domestic Flights, Trek Permits, Ground Transportation and Hotel in Kathmandu. It\u2019s not my habit writing posts over the Internet, however in this case it was inevitable. NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS and its two managers \u2013 RAM and BASU was a big positive surprise. Anything I will say regarding this Company and its two owners will be an understatement. Its starts with the communication \u2013 it was very easy to communicate with RAM via e-mails and SKYPE. As a matter of fact I closed all the details including price quotation over SKYPE from a coffee shop in Israel. Since RAM is so computer literate and responsive, we managed to finalize the whole deal in few hours \u2013 including a deposit of 100$ which was performed via PayPal \u2013 which simplify the transfer. About the prices; since I did my homework in advance I have a clear Idea about the prices. I can say that the price quotation issued by NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS was more than fair and there was no reason to bargain! I accept the quotation as it is, and realize in Kathmandu that the NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS respected 100% all the services and prices we agreed upon. RAM came to pick up from the airport free of charge and provided the same service at the end of the visit. On the first day we were invited by RAM to a dinner. We find out that the best way to changing big amount of money is via NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS! Ram was very helpful with the prepaid SIM CARD for our mobile phone. During our stay in Kathmandu RAM and /or BASU pay us a visit every day just to verify that all is OK. Their office in the Thamel was open for us for any request \u2013 always with cap of tea!!!! We received a triple room according to our request and detailed specification. On our last day in Kathmandu, we have a late flight at 22:00 \u2013 so RAM enabled us a late check-out and provided us with a room to take a shower and refresh before leaving to the airport. All these are small things that make the difference. Hotel Moonlight is operated by NEPAL SOCIAL TREK and is located within the Thamel. For the price we paid (45$ for a Triple Room) I can say that the place is OK with very kind and willing to help staff. One of the biggest successes was the porter provided by company. Nil Sherpa doesn\u2019t speaks English \u2013 except for few word (Up-Up, Down-Down, Slowly-Slowly, very hard\u2026.etc). However you rarely meet such a person- modest, responsive, sensitive and ready to help. He did everything with tones of commonsense \u2013 no words were needed. We asked Nil few times to go ahead and book for us a lodge. In each of the times he booked a place and then returned 1 our back to meet us on the Trek \u2013 it was his own idea! If you work via NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS, and you need a porter (which is also a guide) ask for NIL \u2013 however keep in mind that he weight about 45 kilo, and it will be unfair to let him carry more than 18 Kilo maximum. We are planning our next trip to NEPAL next year \u2013 probably doing the Mustang trek. It goes without saying that SOCIAL NEPAL TREKS will be again our agent company, and NIL will be our porter. It was a great pleasure for us working with RAM and BASU and the NEPAL SOCIAL TREKS staff."

(And they do the best tea in all of Nepal there too!!)You walk in as a stranger and potential customer and you leave as part of the family. We'll be definately going back and Nepal Social Trek will be the first place we'll be going too!!Thank you so much guys!!!"

Nepal Social Treks defies this trend. Arriving in Kathmandu slightly nervous about trekking, Nepal Social took total care of us. Together we disgused our route and they made sure we knew all areas we would be visiting and even giving us tips on how to save money on the trek (being a student this is was a great help). Trekking in Nepal has to be the best and most enjoyable accomplishment I have experienced. You couldn't meet nicer people or witness more beautiful landscapes. If I could be there still I would be. You would be a fool to book with anyone else, Nepal Social Treks will become your friends not just the trekking company you booked with. I've sent all friends I've met to them and everyone has had the same perfect trek, each thanking Nepal Social for making it so that way.  I'm already planning my next trip to Nepal and with Nepal Social. Thank you Basu and Ram for everything. Can't wait to return."

I went on an Everest circuit trek with my good friend Kenneth and everything was just phenomenal. Over 21 days, we covered Gokyo Ri, Cho La Pass, Kala Patthar, Everest Base Camp and Island Peak, all of which Basu and Ram (Nepal Social Treks) organised without a hitch. We were also led by the agency's appointed guide, Dil, who was professional, helpful and added to the fun of the whole expedition. Not forgetting also the ever humble Pasang Sherpa (summited Everest twice) who guided us up to Island Peak. For those who are looking for an agency, especially first time visitors to the Himalayas like ourselves, look no further than this one (: Their hospitality were beyond a doubt top notch too. Ram met us at the airport when we got to Kathmandu and ensured lodging, tour around the city and even treated us to both a welcome and farewell dinner. Probably what separates them from the other agencies is their genuine friendliness and willingness to help. A job very well done guys!"

My sister and I completed the four day \u00a8Royal Trek\u00a8and joked that it was called that, not because Prince Charles walked it, but because Nepal Social Treks treated us like royalty. Our guide, Dil. was outstanding, always available, but never hovering and with a persistently positive attitude that encouraged me up few hills!Nepal Social Treks donates part of its profits to a Kathmandu childrens home www.nepalorphanshome.org which is another great reason to use their services.The pricing was competetive. Be sure to come to an agreement at the outset of a trek or travel and in the event of any changes, which is good policy with any company. I highly recommend Nepal Social Treks to help make your travel within in Nepal or to other destinations from Nepal and your trek successful and memorable."

Those places are amazing and wonderful just like every tourists..every guide books said. But the things that make our trips memorable is the staff from Nepal Social Treks. They are professional, honest and very friendly. We don't need any guide books cos they can tell us many stories. We don't need to bargain anything much cos they give us the reasonable price. We don't need to beware and nervous cos they are honest and very polite. We don't need to waste time and tired cos they can provide everything and bring us to all interesting places within our time limit. They never ask for special gift or special tips from us which some company or some tours some agencies may do. All I need to do is just to say I want or don't want to go where and prepare my camera.

Babu was completely responsive, patient, and provided the best possible \"pre trip\" experience we could have even asked for. Once we arrived in Nepal, we met with both Babu and our guide Sonam.

When we finally made the commitment and started planning one of the major decisions was whether to trek on our own or with a guide. We chose a guide and porter as we also chose a long (15 day) trek. Unique Path had very good to excellent reviews in our research and they lived up to those reviews. We built in extra days in our planned itinerary and that was a very good thing as well. I suffered from gastro problems 2 days into the trek which slowed us and hiking at high altitude has it's challenges as well. We used our extra days to slow our ascent to stay within the recommended altitude gain recommendations. Something we would caution other trekkers to do as altitude sickness is no fun and climbing to fast can void your travel insurance should you need help.Fantastic experience in a country of wonderful people and spectacular mountains. Unique Path adapted our trip plan to meet our needs and wishes, they were very flexible and accommodating. We could not have completed the long trek without our guides help and our amazing porter to shoulder a significant amount of gear. It allowed us to trek with lighter loads and enjoy the experience more.So do your homework, come prepared and do not hesitate to contact Unique Path for help. They are a great choice for planning and carrying out any trek in Nepal. Highly recommended!!Cheers,David & Karen"

My girlfriend and I were fortunate enough to take this trip of a lifetime a while back and could not speak highly enough of every aspect this trip. From the moment we landed in Kathmandu, transfers were arranged and we were effortlessly guided to Thamel. Our guides Ramon & Raj, alongside our sherpa Yup made all things possible with ease. The professionalism, experience, and hospitality of this team makes choosing this company for your Nepalese trek quite easy in my opinion and would certainly use Unique Path again. We chose the Gokyo Ri trek during the month of May which was fantastic. Less popular than Everest Base Camp but comparable views and we oftentimes found ourselves surrounded by snow capped mountains with no one else around. It was heaven! Highly highly recommended. Thank you so much unique path! We hope to return soon enough for the next one!"

It was quite simply an amazing experience from start to finish. We first met at the Unique Path office where we were given a full introduction into exactly what to expect.Our guide Sonam did such a great job of looking after us. It's clear that Sonam had a real inside knowledge on exactly where to go and what conditions to expect. We felt safe and in good hands the entire time. Sonam went above and beyond his duty by taking us around Kathmandu when we returned. We even had the chance to visit the owner Babu during the festival of Desain that year. Such kindness and generosity... I count them both as my friends to this day and I look forward to going back to trek with them whenever possible!"

The team of Unique Paths is so delightful, experienced and nice. They get my highest appraisals. They hire locals only. And get them insurance and treat them super fair. Which you will rarely find in the Himalayas where thousands of tourists travel with agencies that don't insure the sherpas or guides, let them schlepp way too much weight and make them stay in worse housing than their guests! Not with UP. They are fair all the way. The hotel they put us in was the best in Kathmandu. Please be aware of Nepal standards but for Nepal standards this was the best. They were always on time. The guide was very knowledgable and fun and gave is our space. Even had medical ideas around altitude sickness. The sherpa that schlepped our luggage was adorable and we tipped him a a lot. He was providing for his family with this. Please book UP. They are the Fair Trade of Nepal!"

Didn't have enough time to do the trek and the flight around the Himalayas seemed lame. We found the option to have a freaking helicopter take us up into the Himalayas and we jumped at the opportunity. Granted it is not cheap, but after traveling for 7 months, that is still my best memory and one that I've told countless times to others. We took off from Kathmandu, came up through the clouds and were speechless at the view of the Himalayas. We then got a fantastic view of the the big one, Mount Everest, with the classic wisp of clouds at its peak. After landing at a Sherpa basecamp to \"de fuel\" so we could get higher, we then got another, closer view of the storied mountain, along with some of the other massive mountains that pail in comparison. For anyone who wants a lifetime story to share, Do This!! You won't regret it."

I do not exaggerate when I say that they treat you like family. Our wonderful guide Ramesh Duwadi, who we always request, has shown us the wonders of Everest, the Annapurna trail, and we've had wonderful times in Pokhara with him. I urge you to do business with Breakfree. Be sure to request Ramesh! He will take excellent care of you."

            "review": "Bhutan: Breakfree no value added, read to see what we wish would have known prior. Contrary to the great glowing reviews you see for Breakfree, our experience with them was not so nice when arranging an 8 day, 7 night, culture tour visit to Bhutan. Read below to see what we would have liked to know when we started planning the visit to Bhutan.\u2028\u2028Breakfree\u2028Initially Breakfree was very responsive and helpful to our questions. As soon as we paid the deposit however, communication was extremely slow or non existent. I guess that this was due to the unresponsiveness of the visa office. However the slow and non responsive communication increased our frustration and made us unsure of our trip, and the huge cost associated.For the deposit, we refused to write our credit card details an 3-digit code on a piece of paper and send a scan. They offered to accept by PayPal. \u2028\u2028Visa process unclear\u2028Regarding the visa for Bhutan, they would say they would get back to me on date x but it would take several followups by me to get an answer many weeks later. We finally received the visa two weeks before arrival.\u2028\u2028Arrival process unclear\u2028We still didn't know who we would meet in Bhutan or what the process would be upon arrival a day before we arrived! Breakfree finally answered a whatsapp message less than a day before arrival. \u2028\u2028Poor communication made us cautious and unsure\u2028The poor communication with Breakfree brought us to Bhutan in an overly cautious, careful mindset - it set a bad precedent for our week in the Bhutan.\u2028\u2028Good to know:\u2028After arrival, we learned that \u2028- Breakfree is simply an agent for another travel company based in Bhutan\u2028- travel agencies in Bhutan cannot register on tripadvisor, that's why we didn't see any from Bhutan\u2028- Breakfree should have passed us over to the Bhutan agency to answer our questions and arrange things but didn't\u2028\u2028Payment problems\u2028Breakfree also wrote that we could pay by credit card when we arrived. However the Bhutan travel company said this was not correct and they were expecting cash payment in USD. After some arguments, the local company accepted our credit card payment by taking us to a nearby gift shop and charging us the amount plus a fee of 3% (bartered down from 7%). My receipt is from a gift shop. Even though Breakfree sent the name of the local company, Bhutan Wilderness Travel, at the beginning, we had such little contact with them prior to arrival that it was easily forgotten. Fortunately, the manager at the local Bhutan company was in the end helpful, expressed a willingness to help and worked in a problem-solving manner.\u2028\u2028We had a guide and a driver. The driver didn't say much. The guide was young, 30s. He normally does trekking tours which I could see him good for, but for a cultural tour it was not the right fit. He was not fun, his knowledge of many things we saw was little and too general. We even had trouble believing what he was saying. At the end we were not listening much anymore, looking forward to our departure.\u2028\u2028We did meet several people on other tours that expressed their enjoyment. \u2028\u2028Bad start: itinerary was unrealistic\u2028The first thing the guide said upon arrival is that there are mistakes in our itinerary. It was true, the itinerary was not adjusted to the working week. Saturday and Sunday full days were planned, but Saturday is a half working day and Sunday all is closed, most things planned these days were unrealistic. Two long driving days were planned, one he said the road is in too bad of condition to make it to a valley with the planned stop at a fort during its opening hours. The other was too icy because it is so high. The question I'm thinking: is he being lazy or truthful? My only baseline is this itinerary, which we used to select a tour, and now it turned out to be useless.\u2028\u2028Bhutan: not good for independent backpacker explorers\u2028-> To visit Bhutan you must accept that you will be contained with your driver and guide most of the time. If you are an independent backpackers and you don't enjoy the time with your guide, it can feel especially claustrophobic. \u2028\u2028We would recommend to future visitors of Bhutan:\u2028- Bhutan is expensive, daily low season fee of 200 USD and flights around 700 USD each, and a visa fee of 40 USD per person, then a tourism development fund fee of 10 USD per person, put together we paid more than 300 USD per day overall, this is significant - and in our view far too high a price to pay when you consider the cost of living is similar to India. Moreover, we learned that it is customary to tip, 10-20 USD per day, on the higher end for the driver and the lower end for the driver. However, as we were not satisfied with the tour we left no tip.\u2028\u2028Advice if you must go:\u2028- it seems most tours do the same things, book a company through the gov tourism website. Maybe just pick a few at random- we haven't been able to find a reliable review site \u2028- don't use an agent because they will take a cut, meaning less money for your trip, and in our case no value add.\u2028- read lonely planet Bhutan before booking\u2028- stay only for 3 or 4 days max, if you only want to do the cultural tour. We got very tired of forts and seeing the same type of things each day, and being contained by our guide and driver. Unfortunately I don't know how you will ensure the guide you get will be good or not- prepare to spend a lot of money and set low or no expectations\u2028\u2028We liked:\u2028- Tigers Nest, a tough hike but worthwhile \u2028- seeing Phalluses on the front of houses\u2028- seeing Everest during the flight over Himalayas from Delhi (sit at left side window)\u2028- about half the hotels were nice and comfortable \u2028- speaking with locals away from our guide\u2028- hot stone bath and a dinner with a local family, request both to your travel companyOur suggestion for Breakfree: be more straightforward on the status if there's delays, communicate better the process and the next steps, handover properly to the local agent"

            "review": "Amazing guides and excellent value for ABC trek in Nepal and cultural tour in Bhutan. If I could give our guides / porter / driver 6 stars here I would. My fiance and I just concluded two tours with Breakfree Adventures starting with (1) a 9 day Cultural Tour of Bhutan with their partnering local tour operator Bhutan Wilderness Travel and (2) an 11 day Annapurna Base Camp Trek in Nepal.I'm so glad I found and booked with Breakfree Adventures due to their excellent TripAdvisor reviews and value for money. But what really stood out for me was the warm service provided by their amazing staff all around.BHUTANBhutan is a beautiful, unique and sparsely populated country and we were so glad we got to go while many of its customs are still preserved. Sometimes while standing in a medieval village surrounded by green hills and pine forests or inside the walls of a medieval dzong (Bhutanese fortress / temple / palace) I felt like I was in an Asian version of Game of Thrones. No dragons of course but they do have mythical-looking takins, an animal that looks like a moose with a guinea pig face.Our guide Kesang Tenzin and our driver Tandin made our trip wonderful. They took care of everything and all we had to do was follow them, eat when told to eat, etc. Kesang is really funny and extremely knowledgeable about Bhutan's culture and fantastical history, we nicknamed him the \"Divine Madguide.\" We were also lucky to have Tandin as our driver (he was subbing in to help his brother), since he has excellent English as well and we got to talk about things like American movies and TV shows and generally get a perspective on how young people in Bhutan view the future. As Kesang says, Bhutanese men's hemlines are getting longer while women's hemlines are getting shorter.We loved every sight and activity but our top favorite experiences were: (1) Visiting the Punakha Dzong during a once in a 400 year event when the Zhabdrung's relics were on display for the first time and hundreds of Bhutanese were on line to see them and hundreds more were inside the dzong courtyard chanting beautifully in unison. (2) White water rafting on Class III+ rapids in Punakha's male river (my fiance fell off the raft while riding over a set of rapids called Buddha's Wrath!) (3) Trying their national sport archery and eating a delicious traditional dinner with locals and other tourists at a 300 year old farmhouse in Paro. We are excited to go to Bhutan again in the future and will probably explore the much less touristed eastern region with Kesang.NEPALKathmandu is an overwhelming place to land in for the first time (esp. coming from tiny, quiet Paro), so it was great that manager Bharat and our awesome guide Ramesh Duwadi picked us up from the airport and from then on helped us with anything and everything we wanted or needed in Nepal. On day 1, Ramesh helped us rent and buy our gear for the trek in Thamel. Giving realistic and good advice on what we need and don't need. We are hopeless New York urbanites and this was our first mountain trek, and of course we chose to spend it in the highest mountain range in the world! Going from ~1000m to 4130m and back in 7 days.The ABC trek itself was difficult, A LOT of up and down stairs for most of the ascent and descent days (days 2, 3, 4 and 5 were the hardest for us) but well worth it. Seeing the snow covered peaks was the highlight but we also had fun at the lower altitudes seeing all the Gurung villages, cute farm animals, relaxing at Jhinu hot springs and picking / eating elderberries. Noticing that my fiance was picking tiny wild strawberries, Ramesh introduced us to elderberries. The bushes are tall and full of thorns though both Ramesh and Dipak had no problem climbing up and picking handfuls of berries for us. They both went out of their way to make sure we were safe and had fun every day. Ramesh warned us about stinging nettle at the start of the trek. Nevertheless, on day 2 I touched it accidentally when retrieving my dropped poles. I freaked out at the intense pain and Ramesh immediately found and picked a local plant, created a paste and rubbed it onto my fingers which neutralized the pain and he did this again later in the day when the pain came back. Later on the trek I got unpleasant stomach troubles which made me weak and in pain for 2-3 days, Ramesh gave me antibiotics from his first aid kit and even helped carry my day pack when i was struggling up a snow covered hill approaching ABC. The grips of my sneakers were worn out and I fell or slipped almost a dozen times on snow, mud or slippery rocks. I don't like asking for help but Ramesh helped hold on to my arm over particularly slippery stretches. And Dipak helped me up a few times even with a wobbly 30 kg on his back. Just for fun, my fiance and I tried on Dipak's pack and walked uphill for a minute. So tough! Incredible how Dipak carries this all day long, walks twice as fast as us and never loses his balance (even without any poles) and is never out of breath. It must be the legendary power of dal bhat! By day 6 we had soreness in our knees from all the descending and Ramesh led us in a nice mini yoga session. Definitely ask for him if you would like a yoga + trekking tour.Every night at the tea houses (lodges), we would collapse from exhaustion. We never had to wait for a room and our guide worked hard to make sure we would get a large room and not have to share with other trekkers for more comfort. Our guide and porter would patiently wait and make sure to serve us dinner before they would eat. Ramesh would cut us fresh fruits every night for dessert. None of the other guests would have this. Also these guys are hilarious, we would play Nepalese card games for hours every night: dhumbal which Dipak would suspiciously beat us at almost every time and donkey which results in a lot of slamming the table and each other's hands (sorry other guests!). Day after day, they were becoming our good friends.We were not the easiest customers because on day 1 we requested to change the itinerary so that we could stay 1 night at Annapurna Base Camp, meaning we had to be at least 2 hours ahead of the trekking schedule in the days before. And very last minute on the evening of day 6 we requested a change again to take the bus from Pokhara to Kathmandu one day early in order to spend 2 nights in Kathmandu instead of 1. Our guide Ramesh executed the plan immediately, he made a lot of calls (while we were still in a mountain lodge) to change hotels, cancel our bus and even arranged a heavily discounted private car to take us to Kathmandu on the afternoon of day 7. We were so glad he helped arrange all of this so that we could have a full day to explore Kathmandu's top sights.Ramesh and Dipak made our experience in Nepal seamless. While the 3-8 hours of hiking up and down every day was difficult (even for a marathon runner like me), everything else was made easy thanks to the wonderful people of Breakfree. In addition to the trek, we also had a fun tour of Pokhara's top 4 sights and a nice farewell dinner on our last night in Kathmandu, both were with Ramesh. We want to come back to Nepal later to do the more challenging Everest Base Camp and will definitely request to have Ramesh and Dipak again, they're the best."

We didn't think much about it until meal times..... we were the only group that had fruits! Logistic and preparation was very well taken care of. We spoke to other trekkers and realised their guide didn't book the tea house in advance which resulted in them sleeping in the dining hall!

I wrote to several trekking companies, all based in Nepal. Some never wrote back. But Bharat Sapkota got back to me right away. His agency, Breakfree Adventures, is one of the few to also have a US phone making communication prior to my visit easy.I am going to confess right now that I was not an easy client. I changed my itinerary several times before my arrival inNepal, and then changed my trek in Nepal when weather conditions turned sour. Through it all Bharat accommodated me every step of the way. I finally ended up doing an 8 day cultural trek in the Himilayas and a 4 day 3 night trip to Chitwan National Park. In all, I had a great time. Prices were very reasonable and my service was excellent. Every guide I had (trek guide, jungle guide, and Kathmandu City guide were great, fluent in English, and flexible. All made sure I had a great time in Nepal.Recommendations for future travelers. Schedule extra days. Bad weather in the Himalayas can make a trek difficult and getting back on time almost impossible. If, at the end of your trek, you still have time, then Breakfree can easily accommodate you with shorter treks and other tourist options. Regardless, Nepal is a great place to visit and my experience with Breakfree was terrific.Photo is of a large Rhino seen on the jeep tour of Chitwan National Park. I strongly recommend the 4 day 3 night tour of the park as it offers more activities and many more wildlife viewing opportunities than the more common 2 night 3 day trek."

            "review": "Annapurna Circuit Trekking in late November 2015. In 2014, my wife and I did the Annapurna Base Camp Trekking. We were so enthralled by landscapes, people, colours and light that we had to return to Nepal and to attempt the Annapurna Circuit. We were thrilled but also anxious about trekking over 5,416 m altitude (the target altitude on day 11 of the trek), whilst at home in Germany we live just at 45 masl. We booked a package containing two porters and one guide (all English speaking), accommodation and meals, and transportation with Breakfree Adventures. Breakfree Adventures was recommended by my company's office in Kathmandu. After the sudden and tragic events at the circuit in October 2014, we did not wish to do any compromises with the company organising the trek (the readers may recall that a cyclone over India caused heavy snowfall in the Himalaya and trapped trekkers at and around the Thorong-La Pass; it was a sad tragedy and the news went around the world). Our intention was to go with an absolute professional company and experienced and English speaking guide. We checked various sources of customer reviews, including Trip Advisor and all feedback on Breakfree Adventures read impressively positive. Hence, we decided to test Breakfree Adventures. The correspondence was quick and informative. Rates were competitive, and when eventually planning the programme and trekking schedule, Breakfree Adventures was very flexible and included all our suggestions. And indeed we were not disappointed. Guide and porters were professional, very kind and polite, and extremely attentive throughout the trek. We could not have made a better choice. The accommodation arranged was always top range of the guest houses; the budget for food was generous and we were taken well care of from the first day until the last day. We have no hesitation to recommend Breakfree Adventures as a trekking tour operator and organizer for any such tours in Nepal.As most trekkers, we did the Circuit anti-clockwise. We started on Nov 23 for a 14-day tour inclusive travel from Kathmandu to Besi Sahar (by vehicle) and return travel from Jomsom to Pokhara and the day thereafter from Pokhara to Kathmandu (both by air). The trekking itineraries of the Circuit are all similar but the breath-taking part of the Annapurna Circuit definitely starts in Upper Pisang with beautiful vistas of the mountain range and the valley (Annapurna II is just opposite). Photographers can live out all passion and take beautiful night and early morning shots of the Annapurna range (ideal before sunrise). Note, Upper Pisang is definitely worth staying a 2nd day. There is much to see and to discover. The Himalaya Hotel (just below the monastery in Upper Pisang) is a very commendable choice to stay. The views from their balcony and dining room are spectacular.Another stop to remember was Brakha, which is just about 30 trekking minutes before Manang. No question, Manang is a must town to visit and most trekkers stay in Manang. But our reason for staying in Brakha and not in Manang was the easier access and ascent to the Ice Lake (a climb of 1,200 altitude meters) and on the other side of the valley the reach of the Milerepa Cave and the Glacier Viewpoint. When staying in Brakha, an excellent choice to stay is the Himalayan Lodge, a superb guest house with comfortable rooms (toilet and bathroom attached to the rooms) and an exquisite cuisine with surprising international flair. It out-rated all guest houses we stayed before during the trek. Yak Kharka is another perfect spot for night photographers. It is just one night before Thorung Pedi and Thorong-La Pass next morning. I took a series of good shots of the Milky Way before midnight (a tripot is a must). The lower mountain range in Yak Kharka is a fantastic foreground for astrophotography and the clarity during the night was fantastic (early December).Overall the Annapurna Circuit is doubtless one of the world\u2019s most spectacular treks and we will long remember the days. If you have the time, take a rest day at the Fishtail Lodge in Pokhara, a superb hotel on an island in the Phewa Lake and near the main commerce street in Pokhara. It is a beautiful spot to find the sense of time again after having lost it during the trek."

We chose break free adventure as they were rated very high in trip advisor. However, you are not sure how it will all work until you have a positive experience....I have to tell you that the reviews were accurate. Bharath came to the airport to receive us and dropped us at the hotel, made arrangements for exchange of currency arranged for reliable guides for both the city tour and the hike. Bharath is very professional honest and trustworthy. He is intent on making his customers happy.... Just like I the unted states, customer is very important for bharath.As far as the trek, we had an excellent Sherpa called Dorji and he was amazzzzzing..... Very strong carried about 60 pounds on his back and still hiked much faster then us. The Lat two days he came back after dropping the luggage at the teahouse and came back and carried both my sister and my backpack.... We wer amazed how little gear he had so we gave a lot of our gear to him.We did the hike over 6 nights 7 days. It was an amazing journey. Very safe trails. The people of Nepal are very nice and honest people. The food was excellent at tea houses. Our guide had bought with him some fresh fruits to feed us and that also helped. My sister and I were able to achieve our goal of seeing EBC and kalapathar. Overall I had a great experience with break free adventure and recommend them. Also, Nepal seems like a safe country for single women to travel. Amazing place! Amazing people! Talented piolets and beautiful mountains."

It was fantastic!Bharat and his team made sure that I enjoyed my stay every step of the way. My guides were amazing and very knowledgeable and the tour went very smoothly.

We feel deeply saddened by the earthquake that happened soon after we got back. I am sure, however, that soon Nepal will be able to safely welcome tourists.

Flying over Everest was something I always wanted to do and to achieve this was very emotional. I chose to do paragliding in Pokhara, was just a dream with stunning scenery. Bathing elephants in Chitwan was a life ambition and later cocktails watching the sunset rounded off a perfect day. All in all we had an unforgettable holiday in Nepal.

From the first moment you get there, you feel as if you were at home. Bharat, the owner, has a serious company and offers you an excellent service. We really enjoyed everything, but what we really loved was the trekking in the Everest area. If you love the mountain, you will definetly love Nepal and all the options that you can choose depending on the days or the level of difficuty. The first time that we met Ramesh, in Kathmandu, he helped us to get ready before going to the mountains and he really took care of us during all the trekking. His English is perfect and he really knows what he is doing. He gave us good tips all the time while we were doing the trekking and he was always cheerful and helpful. Thanks to Breakfree, we've seen the most beautiful mountains in the world and we lived an adventure that we will never forget.I can't say a bad word about Bharat, Ramesh and Breakfree. They made us love this country and we will definetly come back again. Of course, with Breakfree Adventures."

Nothing was too much for him and he answered every little question we had as quickly as he could. As for the price of the trip and what it included, just outstanding really what can I say! We were collected from the airport by private car and taken on a full day tour of Kathmandu the following day. Our guide was fun and informative and after the initial shock of the city, this tour really opened up our eyes to the cultural, hidden beauty of Kathmandu. The following day we headed off on our 6 hour drive to Pokhara which would be the base for the start and end of our Poonhill trek. We met our guide Ramesh and porter Shree Krishna who I wholeheartedly take my hat off to for carrying out bags with a permanent smile on his face!! This trek wasn't too tough as treks go in Nepal but it pushed my comfort boundaries that's for sure and I loved it so much. Seeing the local people go about their tough daily lives with smiles on their faces really made us take a step back and think about life. Ramesh was great, answering my never ending questions, putting up with my moans about the cold and holding my hand all the way down a serious amount of icy steps on the way to Tadapani, such a star :-) On the way back to Kathmandu, we paid a little extra (and I mean a little) to take the 25 minute flight on the smallest plane I've ever been on but thoroughly worth it! Such was the personal touch that Bharat likes to include in his tours, he collected us from the airport himself, took us out for our final dinner in the evening and back to the airport early the following morning. I recommend you book with Breakfree Adventures wholeheartedly for a personal, incredibly good value for money and life changing trip to Nepal,Bharat and his team should be so proud of themselves for the incredible job they're doing."

We made it to the top of Gokyo Ri at 5,360m - hard to imagine a more spiritual and spectacular place. Toward the end of the trek, we added on side day-hikes to the Khumjung and Thomo villages and monasteries - thus adding a big cultural element to our trek. Highly recommended. Also climbed up the ridge above Machermo during an unscheduled but necessary additional day of acclimatization on the way up. Well worthwhile with views of Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, Cholatse, Taboche, Kantega, Thamserku and Cho Oyo. Breakfree Adventures did a great job. Russell Goodman and Sarah Ellwood."

Maybe we can go from city to city using tourist bus. But after inquiring to chitwan safari tour, I came across Breakfree Adventures who can arrange the whole tour for us. Before we appointed Breakfree Adventures, I raised a lot of questions about Nepal and the trip, and luckily Bharat Sapkota, the owner, was very patient in answering each one of my question.After a few weeks back and forth email communication, we finally agree with the offer and gave down payment. It was the best decision that we could possibly make.The guide assigned to us (Ramesh Duwadi) was really friendly, patient and very helpful. Never get tired of our constant nagging to have food or snack. When we cannot go to one of the site that was in our itinerary because of the landslide, he quickly thought of another place that we can visit as a replacement. It's this type of quick thinking that make us appreciate him even more. Furthermore, Breakfree Adventure also help us even after their service was finished. When the airlines lost my friend's luggage on the first day in Nepal and the luggage finally arrived at Kathmandu after we had left Nepal, they help to arrange for the luggage to be sent to her home.I really enjoy my visit in Nepal thanks to Breakfree Adventure and I recommend this tour if anyone ever want to visit Nepal.

First impression is everything, and out of the numerous companies I had contacted concerning my trip, Bharat wrote back exactly what I wanted to hear. Other companies would just send you random itineraries. Not Bharat! He explained to me everything and even warned me that it might rain and plans might change but he was ready for it! We took a 6-day itinerary and let me tell you we did not have 1 useless minute! Jam packed with everything that we might think of: Bungy jumping, rafting, paragliding, sunrise/sunset-ing, elephant riding, sight seeing, hiking, and even eating! Bharat's choice were perfect, and what made it all better was that we had a personal car, with a driver AND a tour guide! Our driver was exquisite, Nomarash (I hope I spelled it correct!), who was able to drive 5 hours straight sometimes with one break so that we don't waste time, and MAN he's a talented driver!!! Our tour guide Ramesh became family, as we shared numerous hours together and learned so much about this beautiful country! We couldn't have asked for anyone better! I could talk ages about this trip, but I wouldn't want to spoil it for you! My final note would be that we paid a very fair price for all the hard work these gentlemen have done! That's why I'm going again next month, and every month I have the chance to, because Nepal is one of the most beautiful places you can see in life, and Breakfree Adventures will always be there to show me the real beauty this country offers.

Well my friend booked and managed everything for this trip and he sent many emails to different agencies, but no one answered clearly and professionally like Breakfree andventures (Bharat) did! We enjoyed their plans that they suggested, they even threw me a surprise birthday dinner with a delicious cake when my friend asked them to and it was amazing they planned everything perfectly :D We felt so close to the team, and our guide Ramesh is sooo nice and friendly, we felt so comfortable! Plus the choice of hotels and places were perfect!! Thank you breakfree adventures for such a wonderful experience! See you again for sure! "

I said, \"Great, what should I do until then.\" Next thing I new I was on a plane headed to Katmandu. Bharat provided exemplary service. His chose of hotels for a westerner were modest and comfortable. His choice of activities were well suited for me. I choose to fly to Everest. The price of the flight was expensive but worth every penny, though next time with more time I will hike. After three days of adventure I was headed to Bhutan. I was met by a kind tour guide who Bharat had connected me to. He also provided me with exemplary service. He was knowledgable about the culture and religion. He was also kind and gentle.Like any tour service, it is best to know what you want to do before you go. With only a few hours to plan, I just told Bharat and Jamyang (my Bhutanese tour guide) that I wanted an active, cultural, non-western experience and that is what I was given. Bharat is also kind, responsible, and helpful. He is available anytime or day and will provide anything you need. Thanks Bharat and Jamyang. Can't to see you again soon."

Bharat, who will be arranging your schedule and other procedures ahead of the trip, will provide all necessary help, and respond quickly to your questions. Upon the arrival and until the departure, the local guides will also make the best efforts to guarantee a satisfactory stay. Hotels are just \"okay,\" but you will at least find no problems. Foods are also good, if you are comfortable with Asian foods. Above all, the guide is very well informed with the history of Bhutan, and provides clear and easy explanations whenever you visit historical sites. Unlike other tour packages in other countries (based on my experience), they will not take you to shops where they will induce you to buy pricey handicrafts. The entire schedule is focused on your satisfaction. The guide will also modify the schedule upon your last-minute request. For me, instead of visiting more temples, the guide allowed me to have a tea with a lama, and we exchanged various conversations on life, religion, and everything. An unforgettable experience!I know 250 USD a day may seem expensive, it is definitely worth it.There are many Bhutan-related tourism agencies out there, and there could be better ones. But if you do not want to waste time choosing a travel agency, I can tell you things cannot go wrong if you choose to travel with Breakfree Adventures. Travelling to Bhutan may be complicated, but things get a lot easier when travelling with the agency."

I got through to him less than 2 weeks before we arrived in Nepal but he was able to arrange everything very quickly and our tour went smoothly. We basically had a free hand in what we wanted to do (I already had an itinerary from my research and from talking to other tour operators), but he also suggested additional activities that we liked. I picked Breakfree because they quoted the lowest price and required the least downpayment (among operators I equally did not know), but had a great rating on trip advisor. It was certainly the right choice.Our guide Shankar was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the sites we visited. He also acted as our expert photographer and sometimes haggler. He was always waiting for us ahead of time, and concerned with even where we would take dinner after our tour for the day.Our driver was always smiling and an expert in maneuvering in Nepal's tight spaces and twisting mountain roads.The hotels we stayed in were clean and comfortable. In the one case where I asked for a different hotel than the one recommended, the one Breakfree recommended seemed better. At least it looked much nicer from the outside and was on the lakefront.When our mountain flight to Everest got cancelled, we had no trouble getting our money back as Breakfree was the one who processed the refund on our behalf.I also liked the personal touch of the traditional Nepali dinner on our final night before Bharat personally took us back to the airport.In summary, Breakfree was a delight to deal with even before getting to Nepal, and we were very well taken-cared of from landing until takeoff thanks to Breakfree Adventures."

Bharat at Breakfree Adventures filled our brief beautifully. We wanted to do a horse or pony trek in Nepal. We had quite a limited amount of time and wanted to cover as much country as we could. Bharat organised a fantastic itinerary and employed the services of a fabulous guide, Ramesh. Ramesh was informative, interesting, helpful, concerned when we both became a little ill, but not in our face. Perfect! We rode on a couple of local ponies that were very sure footed and quiet. My pony allowed me ample opportunity to take many many photos while walking our track. We have fallen in love with Nepal and will definitely be back to cover another area, and of course doing it in an off the beaten track manner. We will be back to Bharat to help plan and organise this in the future. I have absolutely no hesitations in recommending Breakfree Adventures. If you are looking for something extraordinary, Bharat will be able to organise it for you. A special thank you to Bharat, Ramesh, Nema, Tankanats for an amazing adventure."

The necessary changed of transportation mean from tourist bus to private car(due to time constraint) to access Pokhara, Chitwan and Last resort just cost me a little extra, definitely a great favor from Bharat.

Our trek on the Manaslu Circuit could not have been better managed, coordinated, guided and portered. I have limited vision and knew that the satisfaction of my trek was going to depend to a large degree on my guide's attention and genuine concern for my well-being, as well as my friend's. After reading a previous review by a deaf person, I decided to work with Breakfree. From the beginning, Bharat provided excellent and timely service, even when we needed to delay our trip just two weeks prior to our scheduled arrival. We were very pleased with how he competently handled logistical changes to accommodate our needs. Our guide Tonka went above and beyond, assisting me on difficult trail sections, and providing all kinds of cultural insights as we walked through the mountains; and he's not afraid to jump into a busy teahouse kitchen and whip up a dynamite meal! He's a gem of a guide. He, and our porters, took their jobs seriously, and we shared a lot of laughs with all of them. I couldn't recommend Breakfree enough, and hope after reading this review, you put your trust in them for your trek/trip...you'll be happy you did!"

We had a five day window to trek in the Everest area, but an unprecedented return of the monsoon shut down flights to the starting point, Lukla, for the entire time. After our flight was grounded the first morning, Bharat and trekking guide Ramesh Duwadi, anticipating events, got our tickets switched to Pokhara for that afternoon, so we could trek in the Annapurna area.Unfortunately, the weather was bad there, too, so we trekked five days in clouds and rain. But Ramesh was invaluable. He grew up in a small village, so he could explain everything we saw, from architecture to farming practices to hydroelectric projects. He sometimes went ahead to get us a room at a tea house before the crowds showed up. His English was excellent and he made friends with everybody we met along the way.Breakfree even threw in two extra nights at a nice hotel in Pokhara and Ramesh finally managed to get us a view of the Himalayas from Sarangkot the morning before our flight back to Kathmandu. Then, even though we didn't leave Nepal until five days later, Bharat picked us up from our hotel at 6 am and drove us to the airport."

He just gave us a price quote for the added trip the car was going to take and agreed to wait for us to get back to Kathmandu for the payment.

As a group of 7 friends who enjoy traveling together, we could not have asked for a better experience during our 08 August 2013 day trip to Kathmandu than the one Breakfree Adventures arranged. BHARAT from Breakfree Adventures was amazing in expressions of promptly answering questions and offering travel trips. BHARAT provided the necessary information for our group to make informed decisions, concerning all aspects of the tours including hotel selections, modes of transportation and must see places.We all agreed that the trip could not have been better. We visited Kathmandu, Chitwan, Pokhara, Sarangkot and Dhampus. From the moment we arrived at the Kathmandu airport, we were well escorted. There was not one issue with transportation, the accommodations, tours, and guides. We originally were traveling from Pokhara to Kathmandu by the Tourist bus, but because of a strike, we needed to travel by air instead. This change was handled without a trouble. Tour guides were always prompt and efficient in getting us to the required locations. The choice of hotels offered by Breakfree Adventures allows us to choose a variety of accommodations. In each instance, the hotel personnel were helpful, efficient, and friendly. Rooms were always ready upon our arrival, clean, and above our expectations.Also, during this 7 days tours, there were several misplaced items amongst members of our group - our bag, passports, and even a camera were mistakenly left in hotel rooms. In each case, the items were retrieved by a Breakfree Adventures representative and either brought to us or sent to our next destination.The tour guides were superb, especially Ramesh. We could count on the tour guides to provide us with the local history, culture as well as shopping and restaurant tips, and visits to the local market.We loved every aspect our Nepal tour and appreciate all that everyone at Breakfree Adventures Nepal did to make our journey an excellent. Maybe even the best and we are experienced travelers. We already planning a trip to Ghorepani - Poon Hill and with Breakfree Adventures will be the only travel consultant we contact for assistance!Thank you so much!Kelly and Friends!!"

            "review": "Breakfree in Bhutan!. My wife, son, and I had the most exciting and wondrous trip to Bhutan, all arranged by Bharat of Breakfree Adventures. From the very first email, Bharat was always quick to respond with answers to questions regarding the itinerary, bookings, hotel arrangements, visa and flight information, etc. We were very happy to learn that Bharat would join us on our tour. Our hotels, chosen from the government list which included the Metta Spa and Resort, Meri Puensam, and Peaceful Resort, were charming with clean, large rooms, hot showers, and wonderful food for breakfast and dinner. Our lunches at local restaurants were also excellent. We were pleasantly surprised by the variety, freshness, and delicious preparation of every meal. Our tour guide, Bull, was extremely knowledgeable regarding the history and customs of past and present Bhutan. Our driver, Tenzin, was extremely proficient at maneuvering through the winding, mountainous roads, always making us feel comfortable and safe. We shared meals with Bharat, Bull, and Tenzin which only added more enjoyment to our trip, since we came to know more about the personal lives of the Bhutanese whose incredible country everyone should come to know. We do recommend to everyone that the hike to Tiger's Nest be taken a few days after arriving so the body adjusts to the altitude change. Our 22 year old son made it up to the Nest and back in three hours total time with Bull on the second day of our visit. But then again, he is 22 and his parents are NOT...Overall, Breakfree Adventures is a sure winner when considering a trip to the most glorious of countries, Bhutan. Contact Bharat and discover true, personal service at its best."

A well reputed travel agency in Nepal located in center of Thamel with lots of knowledgeable people and organize rewarding holidays to Nepal. We had a great time in Pokhara and Chitwan even it is monsoon season. Ramesh was very professional guide, and the hotels they use exceed our expectations even we pay less. The road between these locations are not good at all but it is not fault of Breakfree Adventures however they gave us the option of flying to Pokhara or Chitwan to Kathmandu and we choose driving options to fit our budget for this holiday. We have already committed with Breakfree Adventures that we will refer all our friends to them plus we will definitely back to Nepal for easy hiking next year. You will have great time with them for sure."

The guides worked very hard to allow us to have space and at the same time provide any level of explanation which we desired concerning many varied and exotic topics. Where do you start to describe the adventure? My wife and I flew over the Himalayas and got to enter the cockpit where I actually stood when the plane turned towards Mt. Everest. It was spectacular. Unfortunately if you come to Nepal in late May or beyond, the Monsoon is just around the corner and we were denied ground level views of Everest from Nagarkot. Chitwan was great. We saw 10 rare one horned rhinos. One even charged our jeep but was driven off by a very brave tour guide. We saw a sloth bear that was digging into a termite hill and a variety of crocodiles in the streams. There were more bird species than one could count. Our guide in Chitwan, Hari, was the best that anyone could imagine. He arranged a very special tour on elephant back, so we could leave the noisy tourists and get a very intimate look at the jungle. In Pokhara we were again denied a very good view of the Annapurna Range, but things cleared up enough one evening to get a very good impression of just how majestic these mountains are. Amazing! I could go on and on. Please look to the pictures I posted and from others. They are indicative of what you have to look forward to. I would very much recommend Breakfree to anyone who would visit Nepal. They will take care of the details and ensure that you receive the level of service that you pay for."

They sent me the wonderful trek guide, Mr Ramesh and the porter, Mr Sitaram. They are very responsible for my safety but have a good sense of making mountain trekking more fun. They have been very patient with me,a deaf trekker through pen&paper. That was my best mountain trekking in Annapurna Region for all five days with a great success to top of Poonhill...

It was a private trip and Krystyna who organised it thought it would be a bit of an adventure if in doing the Manaslu Circuit we could also do Tsum Valley. She researched local companies and decided on Breakfree Adventures. After the trek one realises how important it is to do the research before booking.In my view I found Breakfree Adventures to be a highly professional company. Bharat the manager couldn\u2019t have been more helpful in organising the trek to our specifications and being ever vigilant to our needs while we were in Nepal.The guide Ramesh, the Sherpas the kitchen staff and the pony handlers did a marvellous job. Putting up tents, cooking meals (tasty and lots of it), serving us, even on some occasions one of the kitchen staff would meet us on the track with a warm drink. For all our needs I found the staff to be patient conscientious and caring.Ramesh was incredible. He was very dutiful, watchful and when needed went that extra distance. Unfortunately two of our group had to be helicoptered out through no fault of Breakfree. Ramesh on both occasions in organising the helicopters went to great efforts to get our companions out as soon as possible. On one occasion he made a helipad with his bare hands. On another occasion he dashed from one small village down to another so he could make contact. When our companions were flown to Kathmandu Bharat was very attentive, booking them into an appropriate hospital and maintaining almost constant contact while they were in hospital and on their discharge. I can only give full praise to Ramesh the Sherpas and Kitchen staff in taking care of us throughout the trek.I would highly recommend Breakfree Adventures to anyone who wishes to experience the beauty of Nepal or any other places that Breakfree Adventures operates in."

Firstly there was Bharat, who eased the way for us in these unfamiliar surroundings. He personally escorted us to and from the airport and booked us into local tours before and after the trek. He went out of his way to accommodate all the needs of two of us who had to be evacuated by helicopter. I was one of them, stricken by altitude sickness on day 17. He dealt with the hospital and the insurance issues, and organised accommodation and activities for me over the few remaining days before driving me to meet up with my fellow trekkers at the final camp. Then there was Ramesh, our guide, who was unfailingly good-humoured, efficient, conscientious and patient with us at all times, and handled the few emergencies that arose with admirable resourcefulness. And the porters, cooks, and general camp helpers, who carried enormous loads on their backs, strapped onto their foreheads, striding past us as we plodded at a much slower pace along the trail. And finally the line of sixteen gentle, patient donkeys and their minders, who bore our luggage and all the camp paraphernalia. All-in-all it was an unforgettable experience and I have already recommended Breakfree Adventures to friends considering such activities in the future."

This was my second tour with Bharat and his team , they looked after us so well last year and so I returned with another friend to see more of the country. In advance we gave Bharat a rough idea of what we wanted to do and see in the 13 days that we planned to visit , we opted for the medium priced budget accomodations. The itinery gave us time in Kathmandu , Pokhara and Chitwan , we enjoyed them all. The range of activities that he planned for us were varied and included , city tours , a 5 day trek in Annupurna region , paragliding in Pokhara , elephant safari and canoe trip in Chitwan , then back to Kathmandu for Everest flight , cultural dance evening and souvenir shopping . Bharat and his team looked after us , nothing was too much trouble . Ramesh was our guide for the 5 day trek , with Shondra our porter , Ramesh' guide psychology and encouragement helped me complete the trek - they even gave me a certificate of my achievement . The accomodations were varied , some more \"rustic\" than others , all had hot water for showers and menus to suit even fussy eaters.Everyone we met was so friendly , there was quite a camaraderie amongst the trekkers , comparing aches and pains , blisters etc .The local people we met were all very welcoming with big smiles . Nepal itself is a beautiful country , I intend to go back hopefully later this year. I wont hesitate to get Bharat to plan my next trip."

Namaste!Dear Bharat,It is time that I wrote to thank you for everything you did to ensure the success of my trek, I realise now that a 25 day trek was a huge undertaking but it was one of the best experiences of my life. The choice of guide and porter was vital and Ram, the guide, was outstanding. His English was first-rate and he was excellent at making sure that I was having a good time. He encouraged me when needed and left me alone at other times. He was full of useful information and I soon realised that his judgement was always good. When he suggested that we stop to have lunch, it meant that we needed a rest before tackling something or other! Several other trekkers commented on how efficient and thoughtful he was and I noticed that many people asked him for advice or information, rather than their own guides. Many trekkers were unhappy with their guides so I was delighted that Ram was so helpful, informative and supportive.Nurbu, the porter, was amazing; at times I lost sight of him and wondered where he was - only to discover that he had taken a short-cut and was way ahead of us. He was always helpful and light-of-heart; he managed my rucsac with no problems.Your organisation was excellent, as well. I didn't believe it when you appeared with my permit for Mustang in Muktinath; you had promised to get it to me but I didn't realise, even then, what a long and hard journey it was to reach a place so far from Kathmandu. You seemed to enjoy it, too!Please feel free to use what I have written as a recommendation. As a 60 year old lady, this trek could have been impossible; it was totally due to your organisation and your choice of people that I completed it and enjoyed every day. It was often tough but I never doubted that I would complete the trek.I will try to send you some photos but I am not sure how fast the connection it. I will wend them separately.Yours,Pat SmithUK"

Nepal is chaotic, especially Kathmandu and the airport. We were very pleased that we chose a guide rather than do it on our own as we normally would. Bharat was very helpful in organising the trip including timetable changes. Also very useful in assisting with updates on flights in Nepal as weather conditions made things difficult. Our actual guide was Ramesh. He was just outstanding. Very knowledgeable and patient. He knew when to talk and when to let us enjoy the serenity. They were very flexible in how we spent our time each day. They assisted with shopping and showed a nice restaurant where we ate several times. Nepal is not an advanced country, there are frequent power shortages, the internet is unreliable, the pollution in Kathmandu is very bad so be prepared for that. But it is a wonderful country to visit.I constantly think of the high mountains and the truly magnificent scenery - and I haven't forgotten the climb into Namche Bazaar, talk about hard work. The flight to and from Lukla is not to be missed, especially the take-off from Lukla. A truly wonderful holiday and we will be back. An excellent guide company and I totally recommend."

Our trip was organized by Bharat from Breakfree Adventures who was very professional and flexible. He designed the journey accurately according to our desires and he was very patient regarding our changes of plan.Our 4 nights tour in Nepal was great and we were fantastically looked after by our guide Govinda. He was always there for our needs and he was very attentive, punctual, and courteous. The long weekend trip including guided city sightseeing tour, white water rafting, day biking and everest experience flight was extremely well priced for our group.If you are working in Dubai and looking for a great destination for your short break, you should fly 4 hour to Nepal and take a tour. The Breakfree Adventures company is highly recommended if you looking for a guide in Nepal."

Overall, my friend and I had a wonderful trip and great experiences both on the \"business\" side with Bharat and with our guide Ramesh. \"Business\" SideBharat was very responsive with emails and helping determine good options for our time frame. Payment was mostly straightforward, but I'd recommend not using PayPal as it looked like it hit Break free with a large fee. We ended up with an extra day in Kathmandu due to reasons detailed below, and Bharat was very helpful in changing reservations and getting us a driver.TrekWow!!! Langtang is beautiful, and highly recommend this area for a more off the beaten path experience. Given it was March and a less popular trekking region, we had trails to ourselves and mostly empty tea houses. Ramesh was everything you could ask for in a guide: professional, fun (we played lots of rummy and \"donkey\" at night), and knowledgeable. Given that a large part of the experience is dependent on your guide, I can't stress enough how lucky we felt to have Ramesh with us. He definitely seemed top tier relative to other guides we met on the trail. He was always making sure we were in-taking enough calories (Orange \"tea\" and cookies became a nice way to finish up the days hike) He also was very cognizant of weather, and had us skip a day of trekking around Lake Gosainkunda due to an unexpected 6 inches of snow. He did a good job of communicating this later on and working with Bharat to plan a day in Kathmandu. With that said, Ramesh also met us at the airport and was our \"in town\" tour guide. Great all around!Misc:My friend and I are both males ~ 30 years of age and in pretty good shape. We carried our own packs and still finished most stretches of the trek in 20-30% less time than Ramesh seemed to normally go. (He of course has no problems with any pace!) Had we known this, we may have tried to do a longer (distance) wise trek ahead of time."

We are both in agreement that it is (by far) the most beautiful country we have ever visited. The people were so kind and hospitable, and the sights throughout the trek were absolutely breathtaking. If you are looking for time away from a concrete jungle, the Annapurna trek is definitely your best choice. The Rhododendron forests were absolutely magical. So much green and supernatural beauty. Our senses were incredibly spoiled! Nepal was the perfect escape destination we needed after spending the past 7 months in dry, dusty, hot Kuwait. We were very happy with our guide, Romess, and our porter, Chandra. Romess had a lovely warm spirit and eagerness to ensure that we were always happy. Chandra's fun-loving, enthusiastic character made it impossible not to enjoy his company. His strength and perseverance completely astounded us.Dhonyabaad to Breakfree for an incredible experience. We are highly recommending treks in Nepal (with Breakfree Adventures, of course) to all of our friends, and we look forward to visiting Nepal again sometime in the future.Holly and Martina"

I knew my guide Ramesh Duwadi from two years ago, as well as Bharat Sapkota who now manages Breakfree Adventure Travel. From planning all the details through online chats and e-mails, I could not have asked for better or more responsive service. I started the trek with my friend Dennis who, unfortunately, had to drop out after 6 days of struggling with sleeplessness caused by altitude sicknes. We took him to the hospital in Lukla. Bharat was able to get him on a flight to Kathmandu and on to the U.S. the same day. For the rest of the trip, Ramesh and our porter Suria continued to do everything possible to make my experience unforgettably beautiful. Suria always had a welcoming smile when we talked, particularly when I struggled up the infamous Chola Pass. When I had to change the itinerary because bronchitis prevented my from going to Gorak Shep, Ramesh helped me by carrying my day pack for the rest of the trip. When we got to Lukla, hoping to fly out, we got stuck for 7 days because of dense fog. Ramesh made sure I lacked no comfort available.

Kathmandu is an amazing place, with all its temples, stupas, worshippers , traffic, shops spilling on to the narrow roads in the Thamel district. The friendly Nepalese to help you when you get lost, and you will, the history of it all and the peaceful way so many faiths co-exist is a lesson to the world. But although the guide books tell you to haggle on prices, do you really want to bearing in mind their standard of living compared to yours? A yak wool shawl that takes one person 10 days to make- how much should you pay for it, how much would you want to be paid for 10 days work? Strongly advise going vegetarian and beware lassi a yogurt drink( i may have got Salmonella from it, or other food at a banquet)Use a city guide to explain the customs and get the most out of a day's visit,& they expect a good tip. Fog stops flights frequently though so leave some flexibility in your return flight home !Kantipur Temple House is a great place to stay, beautiful architecture, good food and an atmosphere of peace and tranquility which is great after the noise and explosion of sounds, smells and sights which bombard the senses. A lovely place to chill out and refresh the soul."

I discovered Adventure Master Treks by chance the first day I arrived in Kathmandu, and to my surprise, these guys arranged everything for me in only one hour. The second day I did some sightseeing in Kathmandu with one of their drivers who was a really nice guy.After that, I did the Poon Hill trek (6 days) in the Annapurna area. This place is simply amazing and is something you MUST see. My trek guide, Gokarna, was incredible. He let me set my own pace during the trek, and was always willing to discuss with me the history of the places we visited and the local traditions. Although we visited around 10 villages, I strongly recommend that you do a longer trek (at least 10 days) up to the Annapurna Base Camp. Unfortunately, I didn't have more days but I'll definitely visit this area again."

I arrived in Kathmandu without any plans and was somewhat suspicious after being approached by someone at the airport who accompanied me to Adventure Master's Office. I met with Santosh who explored my interests and offered several recommendations. I was pleasantly surprised that there were no high pressure sales tactics. Santosh encouraged me to think about it overnight and get back to him the next day. I did so, checked out Adventure Masters on TripAdvisor, did a little comparison shopping and decided on the 5 day 4 night trek. Santosh offered a better price than the competitors. I would be responsible for purchasing food and beverages on the trek. Everything else was included and provided. My guide Hira was excellent. He had a wealth of knowledge about life and trekking in the Himalayas, introduced me to many locals during the course of our trek and was a pleasure to be with. The trek was physically demanding but Hira paced us accordingly. Given that it was the beginning of monsoon season, there were only limited opportunities to view the peaks. I knew this when I signed up. Nevertheless, the opportunity to experience nature and the local culture made the trek one of the highlights of my trip. I would trek with Adventure Masters and Hira again in a heartbeat and highly recommend them."

The 9 days in the Arun valley are very beautiful, and the Khumbu region above is staggering, we highly recommend the trek, although the long time (25days) does take it's toll and it is very hard work.The guide that Santosh arranged for us (Jangbu) was excellent. He was local to the region and clearly had the local knowledge. His English was very good, and his French excellent. He was a greatt companion throughout the trek, and invaluable as a guide taking care of all our arrangements on route. Santosh's arrangements were all done on time, and all the flights and permits all worked. He also arranged for us to meet Jangbu and himself the evening before our departure, and had an informal debriefing with us in his office after which was very professional. Our only criticisms are that he did not introduce himself as a trekking organisation but claimed to be from the hotel before leading to his trekking office. Also the evening before we departed he gave us a \"schedule\" that he had \"made\". This was actually a copy from another camping trekking companies website that was not relevant to our own plans. Other than these small problems we were happy with his service."

I didnt have to worry about anything (accommation, getting my own water, when we would leave in the morning, etc). His top concern was safety. Doing a high elevation trek bring many challenges, but I was able complete the trek with absolutely no issues.

You can book through Adventure Master and ask for our guide, Hira. He will customize the trek to your needs and is very good at telling you what is best for you. I definitely needed his advice for certain parts of the trek. It is possible to trek on your own, but I would advise to have a guide for the first time. Especially someone like Hira who has done this trek over a hundred times and was able to go down the trails completely covered by snow and basically invisible without any problems."

This agency was responsible for our tour, we handcrafted our tour together according to our 14 days availability. Our agent - Santosh devoted a great deal of his time in discussing our primary interest in having a great trek experience. Santosh was great in handling all the arrangements to include our hotels, personal drivers, buses reservations, private tours and doing a follow up afterwords. He had explained to us about Nepal situation at the moment - the crisis of fuel, gas and eletricity which didn't almost affect us. Thanks Santosh for your warm smile.During our 4 days trek to Poon Hill we had one of our best experience ever!!! We were able to see beautiful views, contact the amazing Nepali people, experience their culture, food and happiness. Without question what made the difference in our trek was our private guide - BHARAT KUMAR which spoke very good English, he was friendly, polite, knowledgeable, patient and funny. We had a great 4 days with BHARAT ; ) He really stands out from the other guides, he was always walking behind/next to me making sure to help me if needed it, he patiently waited me to get my breath back whenever I needed it, he was kind to us and to Nepali people, we had great conversations during our trek, he taught us some Nepali words, the name of the trees and mountains, he also let my husband win every card game round. lololololo One thing I had missed in our experience which was the connection with other travelers, I guess it was because of our tight schedule. Poon Hill trek was beautiful and magical. It is a very tranquil trek with a great atmosphere. I was very impressed with the structure of the lodges and restaurants along the way. If you decide to do a tour in Nepal, I would recommend the following:1. Make sure to ask for Bharat as guide ; )2. Learn to say Namaste/Bohini/Di di/Dahi or Bayi. These simple acts of respect go a long way3. Travel Light, Light. Light; did I say Light. You will burden yourself with Luggage if you do not heed this advice. 4. If you are taking buses, go Turist bus, first class or private car. It is well worth the few extra dollars. MAKE SURE WITH YOUR AGENT. 5. Try to avoid public transportation such as local buses which can be extremely overcrowded in the larger cities. Rush hour can be overwhelming. Take either a metered taxi or arrange for a private driver.6. Make sure with your agent the quality of the hotel, if you have heating/AC in the room and if the hotel is experiencing power outage - very common. Lastly, our trip to Nepal exceeded our expectations. I highly recommend this company and our guide for your custom handcrafted tour of Nepal."

No hassles, everything ran to plan and the guide Shital was great company and went out of his way to add the little things that made the trek even more enjoyable. Highly recommended."

            "review": "Amazing experience, great value for money. My friend and I arrived in Kathmandu with no plan but knowing we wanted to do a short trek from Pokhara. We met Keshab from Adventure Masters in our Kathmandu hotel and he suggested a 3 day Poon Hill trek which would be ideal for our time available and our fitness levels. He clearly broke every cost down and we were so comfortable booking the trip and knowing everything was taken care of. The whole 3 days we didn't have to worry about a thing. All our transport and accommodation was taken care of and we had an excellent guide - Gopal. Gopal was quiet but very knowledgable (although sometimes difficult to understand) and he encouraged me up the hard stretches and let me go at a comfortable pace the whole way (as I'm not the fittest person!) The trip was an excellent experience and we felt it was great value for money. The only 2 negatives I have are that on the final day (Christmas Day) we let the guide know we wanted to be back in Pokhara early to celebrate Christmas and we descended the mountain really quickly to do so but then the driver taking us back to Pokhara was 30 minutes late so we didn't arrive in Pokhara until later than we had hoped. Also, on our return to the hotel the guide made me sit down at a computer to write this review (with him standing close by) when I am tired and just wanting a hot shower and to celebrate Christmas! Awkward! Apart from these things, I can't fault the experience at all. Amazing trip!"

I was planning on doing the trek solo, but I have to say that the last minute decision to hire a guide was a good one. My guide, Mr. Sagar, taught me about culture, language, flora, fauna, and pointed out many things that I would have otherwise missed without his help. He always had a smile on his face, like all theven considering the difficult times in the country due to recent events. My hat's off to him and I'm looking forward to revisiting Nepal and travelling to the Everest region."

A total of 10 of us from Malaysia signed up for the Annarpurna Circuit + Tilicho Lake trekking tour. We hiked along mountainous region of Himalaya Range as if we were in an expedition in the movie \"Everest\". It was strenuous and challenging at start. However, as time passes, our fatigue was entirely engulfed by the amazing views of \"Vanila ice cream with chocolate top\" - the snowy view of mountains.Not forget to mention, our tour guide, Keshab was a great young man who can speak fluent English and Bahasa Malaysia. He shared a lot of hiking knowledge with us. For instance, he didn't recommend for us to take medication for altitude sickness. He would rather suggest us to stay longer time for acclimatization. As Nepal is not a developed country like US, wi-fi doesn't come handy. Keshab would sometimes entertain us with his Nepalese David Copperfield-styled magic. Porters in the company were also very helpful. Please be more generous with your tipping, though they don't request it. Also, do hire additional porter if necessary. It is not an easy job to be a porter, carrying tens of kilograms of weight behind their backs.Overall, it was an amazing trip. I will definitely go to the same country and sign for the same company under the same tour guide AGAIN."

After various inquiries with different tour operators, I finally decided to let Outshine Adventure handle my family's cultural & sightseeing tour of Nepal. The main reason is that the owner, Mr. Gokul Sapkota was quick to reply to my queries. Pricing was reasonable and he was able to offer all that we required- comfortable hotels, private vehicles with air-conditioning, knowledgeable guide & airport transfers. Had I asked for a helicopter in case I needed to be bailed out of altitude sickness, I'm sure he could have easily arranged it too. Okay, I'm going too far talking about altitude sickness. There's no such thing when just visiting UNESCO sites & looking at the Himalayas from a low hill, sipping organic Nepali tea if you please. To put it simply, Gokul is very resourceful & trustworthy.We arrived late at night with our flight delayed for an hour. I thought we could get out of the airport easily as we already filled out our Nepalese visa application online. But then, the airport carousel took so long to spew out the last luggage, with none of ours arriving. We got more delayed coming out of the airport because we had to file for baggage tracking. Anyway, after that arrival hiccup, we were quite happy to see the Outshine representative whose name I forgot meet us when we got out. He & the driver were very patient in waiting for us & i commend them for that. The following morning, we met up with Gokul in his office right in Thamel. He briefed us about our tour. We paid him the balance of our tour cost. He also helped us with currency exchange, giving us a much better rate than at the airport or elsewhere. He was very cordial & we felt assured that we could count on him.Siri, our guide for our day tours in Kathmandu, was knowledgeable, helpful & professional. We also felt safe with all the drivers. All the vehicles used were comfortable and bigger than the typical car in Nepal which can be quite tiny.Before we left Nepal, we had dinner with Gokul and met his beautiful young family. I'm so glad I went with Gokul & his Outshine Adventure team. You can easily see the passion he has to succeed as well as helping others.Overall, we felt safe & had a great time in Nepal. Do go if you haven't. I want to go back someday. Thank you, Gokul and Outshine Adventure team."

We arrived New Years eve, with the plan for the next few days to check out all the tourist sites ourselves. Well, a few days of travel from the states and having to switch hotels after one night left us a bit exhausted. We opted to utilize the services of a Tour Provider in the area. We found Gokul and Outshine Adventures here on Tripadvisor. Our hotel was only a 10 minute walk from the office, so we decided to go over and see what could be arranged for the next two days in Kathmandu. Even though it was last minute, Gokul put together an excellent itinerary with one of the best guides I've experienced during my travels! Gokul also advised against some of the items we were asking about (His thoughts were, the weather wasn't clear enough to see anything....he was totally right!)The driver and car were both great as well! I really can't say anything bad about the tours Gokul setup. The guide even helped us with buying some medicine at the pharmacy, and was very understanding when one of us was feeling a bit under the weather towards the end of the tour and just wanted to relax. (Sorry to the Thangka School we were touring at the time....the work was beautiful and If not for starting to not feel well, we definitely would have stayed longer and bought something!) Gokul even helped arrange our airport transfer back to the airport.The trip ended up being such an incredible experience, thanks in part to Gokul. If I find my way back to Nepal (which I very much hope I do!), I will absolutely be utilizing the services of Outshine Adventure. Thanks again for everything!"

We were very late coming out of the airport because of long visa lines and also because the airline had lost my luggage. I was worried the driver might not wait so long but he was waiting there with the sign even though we were well over an hour past our planned arrival. Our trip went exactly as planned. Our guide, Amit, was very friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and spoke very clear English. I was worried about our luggage, but Amit put us at ease, saying \"your worries are now my worries, so you can enjoy your visit\". He and Gokul took over all communication with the airport regarding my luggage and I indeed didn't have to worry about it at all. Amit delivered my luggage to the hotel soon after it arrived at the airport. This would have been very difficult for me to arrange by myself.Another major event happened during our visit. A Turkish airliner crash landed at the airport, which caused the airport to close for 4 days. Our outgoing flight to Varanasi India was cancelled and there was no indication when the airport would reopen. This is where Gokul's services really shined. He took us under his wing and informed us of several options we had of getting to India. We ended up booking an overland bus directly from Kathmandu to Varnasi. Gokul handled everything including buying the tickets, arranging for an extended stay at our hotel, and having a driver take us to the bus station and make sure we we got on the bus successfully. I don't know what we would have done without Gokul and Outshine Adventures. Through the whole trip, Gokul was always working in the background, ensuring we knew exactly what was next. He seemed to anticipate our every need before we even knew what we needed.I highly recommend Outshine Adventures for any trip to Nepal. You can rest assured that he will take care of you, even when things don't go as planned."

This is company is super highly recommended, i have booked my adventure with them 3 times within 3 years for a reason. Gokul is easy to communicate and he's reply is very prompt. He'll arrange for you with what ever u need as soon as u arrive at the airport until u go back to the airport to fly back. Price is very reasonable. and for me what matters most is the it's more than just business, there's soul in it. My friend left his phone in the car on the way back to the airport, while we left the Nepal, Gokul manage to save the phone and take the effort to post it back to us.So book with these guys now!Just in case u want to know which trek did i do: first was Nagarkot, second was Poon Hil, third was Khumjung via Lukla"

Aside from the trek, Gokul (the owner) arranged our accommodation and a day tour in Kathmandu. The accommodation was excellent as was the service we received from when we first booked the trip, during the trek and afterwards.Our guide during the trek, Naba, was fantastic. He gave us great advice and looked after us while I trudged and my husband bounced through the mountains. Unfortunately I had to be helivac'd from Dingbouche due to altitude sickness and even this was arranged seamlessly. The helicopter was there within an hour, I was picked up straight from the airport to the international hospital where I was met by Gokul who took care of everything for me, including arranging everything regarding our travel insurance.My husband finished the trek to Base Camp and came back with amazing photos and lots of great new friends. We had an absolutely fantastic time. I would not hesitate in recommending Outshine for any trips to Nepal."

Our vacation was too short to explore all of Nepal, but we plan on coming back to Nepal in a few years to take on EBC and there is no doubt that we will be using Outshine to plan our next trekking adventure! Thank you Gokul for making our trip a memorable one. See you soon!"

Outshine covered us from transport, tour guides and meals for our 5 day stay in Kathmandu. upon arrival gokul gave me a quick briefing from what is included on our tour and what else we can add and edit from the stuff that we talked about online. He also made sure we had all necessary insurances during our stay in kathmandu. Our guides treated us like friends visiting them. they showed us local scenes and told stories of the old world and new. I was glad i chose outshine adventure."

SInce i did not have a local number there in kathmandu, my tour agent incharge of us, Arjun, took his own phone and called my airlines number in kathmandu and coordinated with them. Apparently outshine has quite an influence there. All in all, they aimed for customer satisfaction and to ensure our stay is pleasant. our guide even told us how certain things work in nepal and it saved us from being hustled from other Nepalese. if i do come back to nepal, definitely it will be sunshine =)"

They arranged everything so well including our flights from Kathmandu to Pokhara and return. We were met at the airport. All connections were perfect. We had a chance to meet several guides from this organization. All were personable and professional. When we left, we felt we had made new friends. Gokul has built a top notch organization in a relatively short period of time that now includes 17 guides. (Our guide, Dambar, had to be the best.) They are worthy of their #1 ranking and I would highly recommend them. We hope to book another trip in the future to a different area - maybe Tibet or Bhutan."

I very much enjoyed the entire planning process and most importantly the actual delivery was above my expectations.For my private tours of Kathmandu Valley, I had a fantastic guide. Bijay took me to explore so many fascinating sites around the valley. Bijay was so friendly, welcoming and his English was extremely good. I would highly recommend scheduling private tours to explore the best of the Kathmandu Valley and I strongly suggest you do so with Outshine Adventure. My trekking expedition was also amazing as it was a private one. My guide and porter were both fantastic. One of the best moments of my entire \"round the world\" trip was when both Shankar and Nabarad sang to me a Nepalese song as we trekked our way through the forrest.

You name can be that, this is a trick... But Promise turn out to be fantastic, and had a good offer for EBC trek. So next day we went to Top of the World Adventures (TWA) office were we met Mr.Nepal, and negotiated price for the Shivalaya-EBC trek. Although my friend and I initially had decided to due the trek without porter or guide, it was fantastic to have a porter/guide with us, and Mimea was kind and funny.  After the EBC trek, with did use TWA to arrange a short trip to the Chitwan national park. That to was super, with a lot of activities for a relatively low price.All in all TWA is are very good company, with some really nice and talented employees. Good in business and good a communication, which is just great. I am planing to go back to Nepal, with my family and will definitely use Top of the World Adventure for arranging my trip!Thank you for a nice friendship Top of the World Adventure, see you in the future.Best regardsKim"

We did some research at home about the opportunities of extreme sport in the country. When we arrived at the airport, we were met by Mr. Nepal. A very nice man who speak good English. He recommended a good place to stay (cheap and good) and a taxi driver. The next day we visited his office. Mr. Nepal and his staff members (Sandace and Deepak) was very kind and helpful and treated us like \"brothers\". We only had 16 days in Nepal, so we were pressed on the time. With Mr. Nepals experience in the tourist business, he made a 15 day program were we could experience the most important things in Nepal. That included trekking, paragliding, bungy jumping, river rafting, sightseeing, hotels, transportation etc. The program went very good and they took care of everything. When there were the smallest problem, Mr. Nepal fixed it very quick. Like he says. \"I provide all services for you\". If you are going to the beautiful country of Nepal, I/we will definitely recommend \"Top of the world adventure\"."

When it came to going to Everest base camp, I was engaged by this company and I ended up signing up.What did it for me was how through they were in explaining everything, and it never felt like they were selling me something or taking my money. There was a sense of pride and genuine care about their customers and their product. If only, every travel agency was like this....As for the tour itself, it was perfect. Everything was taken care of and there were no hiccups. The guide that we were paired with was a rockstar and took very good care of us.If you are looking for a travel agent that really cares about the product he is selling and really wants to make sure you have the best experience possible, look no further than this one.Yuki"

And even though I often found myself wondering if having a guide was actually a necessity, I must admit that it did have some nice advantages. It made my journey alot more comfortable than it could have been otherwise. On the evening before I would take my flight home, the dinner we we're supposed to have got canceled.

Our guide Harry Pokhrel from\u00a0Great Vision Treks and Expeditions was\u00a0top class. His English was excellent, his care for our welfare during a sometimes gruelling experience was\u00a0second-to-none and he was great company too! Our porter (soon to be guide) Krishna Khanal was\u00a0strong (machine-like stength) and had great humour, rounding out a stellar team!\u00a0The Manaslu circuit is a highly cultural and challenging experience. The mountain when you see it, is easily the most spectacular we saw in the entire trek. Though we originally planned to trek the Tsum valley, the state of the trail leading to it was unsafe. One complaint of ours is that Great Vision failed to inform us of this until we were basically starting the Tsum valley! To be fair to them, they had a plan B and we changed our itinerary on the spot to include the Annapurna circuit. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, insofar as the Annapurna trek was awesome. Ask your trekking company about the state of your chosen trek, be aware they don't like to disappoint you so perhaps reassure them that any news is good news where safety is concerned.Shankar, the manager of Great Vision, kindly picked us up from\u00a0the airport, welcomed us warmly to Nepal and was generally very friendly. Our only complaints about his service was occasional lack of clear information. I would recommend potential customers to challenge him on everything to do with transport to and from the trek and transport of your bags if you are ending up in Pokhara afterwards.Harry our guide is local to the Manaslu region, actively seeks local knowledge regarding state of the trails and landslide prone areas. He ensures food is hygienically prepared and trust him on his choice of accommodation. Generally his choice is best and he is alert to Western comforts. He is also great buzz and taught us many things about the local flora and fauna (including eating foraged food) as well as many evenings playing Nepali card games together. He is a kind-hearted and honest man who we instantly warmed to. He even invited us to dinner with his lovely wife Sangita when we returned to Kathmandu (she is an amazing cook!).Our porter (again, soon to be guide) Krishna was also awesome company and such a funny dude. Same as Harry, he is local to the Manaslu area and is actually Harry's cousin!Overall, our experience, aided by Great Vision, was mind-blowing. If we had to choose one trek over the other, our choice would be Manaslu. It is more challenging (no wifi and basic accommodation) but also much more rewarding than the Annapurna circuit. The Annapurna circuit was well marked and provisioned and the views are simply glorious. It is obviously to the customer's taste which\u00a0trek they decide to do. But we cannot recommend Harry or Krishna enough.Cost for two people, a guide and porter,\u00a0all necessary permits and accommodation paid for (we paid for food and considered it a saving over paying upfront) was 1650 USD. We considered this a fair price. However I would mention that if we were to do it again, we would also pay for accommodation ourselves, despite having to carry more cash.Some essentials :Take chlorine solution for water. No need to buy any just fill up from local taps in the mountains. Your guide will help you choose faucets or tals that are safest. We also had a lifestraw and a steripen.Bring snacks with you if you can. Buying on the trail is costly.\u00a0Be careful on the Manaslu trek there are some areas which can turn dangerous in a hurry. Ask your guide questions about the state of the trail and how safe sections are as you encounter them.\u00a0In Lho, a small village in the Nubri valley, visit the small monastery in the town. The monks and especially their Tibetan cooks are so welcoming and looked after us with a fire and plentiful tea. Lovely experience.At Sama, if the weather is clear enough, attempt Manaslu base camp on your rest day. It is gruelling but at the top the feeling is incredible. You also gain some valuable acclimatisation and sleep well that night!"

Shankar met us at the airport and helped us plan an awesome trek in the Upper Mustang region. We were assigned Ragesh (we called him Razz) who really took care of us on the trek. Our plane from Pokhara to Jomson was cancelled and Shankar organised a jeep for us all the way from Kathmandu so we wouldn't miss out on our trekking days. When we changed our plans for the end of our trek (choosing to spend some time in Chitwan instead of heading back to Pokhara) Shankar ensured that we had a ride to Chitwan and organised a driver to get us back to Kathmandu. While we were walking Shankar also organised our India visas and bus trips for the next part of our journey out of Nepal!Overall, Great Vision are an warm and friendly company. Almost everyone who works in the company is family to Shankar, and GV really go out of their way to help you. From booking stuff to telling you the fair price to pay for souvenirs and services. Our guide had a backpack full of medical supplies and additional clothing in case it got cold and ended up helping other trekkers along the way who had less prepared guides. I would 100% recommend Great Vision trekking to anyone (and will send my friends their details) and will definitely be booking with them when I'm back in Nepal."

Instead, the travel desk at the airport took my information about the type of accommodations and travel interests and then pointed me to a smiling young man... Shankar. He quickly came over to the desk, listened to the info and assured me that he could make the arrangements and have me booked to Lukla quickly with a guide and mountain accommodations. He was very friendly. He and his driver ferried me and another airline passenger for no charge to the hotel wherein his office was prominently located. (Note: This worked well in Nepal but, when in South America, never get in a vehicle that is not marked as a taxi). Shankar handled every detail from that first day until I got in the plane for the flight back home. He did so for a very reasonable fee. Shankar, the tour operator and a former guide, described the itinerary and possible flight delays due to the start of the \"rainy season.\" I flew out the next morning and was met at Lukla by a wonderful young Sherpa, Gyelgan. He spoke good English in several dialects. Gyeljan took good care of me. He quickly ascertained my conditioning level and monitored my health status regularly and adjusted our hiking speed and itinerary as reasonable and necessary. Overnights and dayly meals in the various \"tea houses\" made travel easy. I had a great time interacting with local people. Gyelgan seems to know everyone. There is no need for a tent or a sleeping bag. The rain did delay our flight back to Kathmandu but Gyelgan and Shankar modified flight tickets and coordinated with pilots as necessary to get me a flight. No worries for me. Overall, it was a great trip with wonderful friendly people. Oh! The views and scenery are spectacular - as expected.JesseRetired firefighter USA"

They were always smiling and laughing, and they were very encouraging of us as well. If you plan to go to Nepal to do any hiking, I highly recommend requesting Ganesh as your guide, and go with Great Vision. There are many many trekking organizations in Kathmandu, but seriously- go with these guys."

I arrived on their Holy day, and 5 minutes after throwing my bags in my motel room at Thamel, I went with Madan into the streets to be painted and flowed the evening into dinner with Madan and his brother Kedarmani. The next day I was in their office and enjoyed the fun we had planing my day tour, treking and a wildlife safari. The tours were fantastic fun. I traveled on my own, but never once felt like I was alone as the boys were always there if I wanted something. Shankar even helped me with a phone sim. I stay in touch with the boys and I am looking forward to returning to Kathmandu, hopefully sooner than later. What more can I say. They are very professional.....don't hesitate...just do it!"

I was so lucky to meet Shankar at the airport when I arrived in Nepal because he helped me with my whole itinerary while I was there for 2 weeks. He planned for me a trip to Chitwan and a trek, including all of the transportation to/from Kathmandu. He was really informative, explaining what each part of my trip entailed, and he brokedown the prices for me as well. I actually had a wound on my leg that was healing slowly, and he was very flexible with me, letting me know that if my leg didn't heal after my Chitwan trip that I could get my money refunded for the Annapurna trek (and told me how much that would be). That was such a relief. I found him to be very friendly and engaging, and I think that all the people for the company appreciate working there because of the atmosphere - something that is rare to find sometimes. I LOVED everything about the Chitwan trip that they put together, including the hotel and the guide that I had while there. I ended up being able to do the trek, and I think I got the best trekking guide in Nepal, Harry:) He actually works for Great Vision and does different treks for them. I felt like I was hiking with a friend from home. Except Harry would bring me masala tea every time I was cold:)!! He was very sensitive to my needs and actually ended up changing what we did on the last day of the trek on the fly b/c my shoes weren't handling the snow/ice on the trail we were to take. SO awesome. The places we stayed at during the trek were so much fun. I really had a blast in Nepal. I'm so happy that I was able to get help from Shankar and Harry at Great Vision b/c they made my vacation there so much fun. When I return to Nepal to do another trek, I'll definitely want to go with Harry as my guide and Shankar coordinating:)"

The Guide, Prakash Simkhada, Great Vision provided was very experienced and did the trek several times. Also we became really good friends on the trek and had an amazing time. Another group of Great Vision who started at the same time with an other Guide got some troubles due to the bad weather (it was snowing for two days) and altitude sickness in Samdo. Great Vision managed their fly out with the Helicopter as well as they managed everything with the insurance to pay. Our group could safely pass Larke pass and from Dharapani we took a Jeep. I guess managing all the transport at this time (for weeks there was a big shortage of petrol and gas due to the blocked border to India) was not very easy, but it worked out perfectly. I can absolutely recommend Great Vision Treks and Expeditions they were able to provide a perfect, safe and amazing Manaslu Trek under not easy circumstances. Moreover we became really good friends to the lovely family runned company. Next Time in Nepal I will go Trekking with them again."

Our guide, Rajeswor Amgain, and our porter Krishna Pandey, were crucial elements in helping us complete the trek (I am 53 years old, so not in my prime). We were faced with unusual weather conditions, with lots of snow on the higher portions of the trek. Our guide and porter were very attentive to our needs, and proved to be excellent companions and organizers.I heartily recommend this trip to anyone. I might add that my daughter was 14 years old at the time, so well done!Great Vision treks, and in particular Kedar, did an excellent job of organizing our trip according to our time requirements, and at a fair price.I would heartily recommend this trekking company should you wish to trek around Manaslu."

Kedar took the time to get to know us our interest and our budget. He recommended activities based on our interest and within our budget. He booked everything and always had someone meet us and take care of us both in Kathmandu and Pokhara. He uses knowledgeable guides who have a high level of fluency in the English language. He handled every detail with precision for sight seeing in the mountains, touring historic temples, booking airfare to and from Pokhara, drivers in Pokhar and Kathmandu, hotels in Pokhara and Kathmandu and even paragliding. He even drove me to the airport for my return flight to Texas at no charge and that was a ticket I booked before meeting him. He saw me off with a Nepalese good luck token. I couldn't be happier with my experience with Great Vision Treks & expedition and with Kedar. Despite the news coverage of the earthquake earlier this year, Nepal is a beautiful country and is open for tourist! I plan to return to Nepal in the future and I will let Great Visions handle all the details of the trip for me."

Kedar (Managing Director) took to us like family in Nepal and provided us with an exceptional guide in Ram for our first two days in Kathmandu. We were able to see everything we wanted to in the city and he was very knowledgeable about the city and all of the symbolism and history throughout the city. After two days, Kedar decided he would personally take us to the countryside to make us feel like true Nepali. Unfortunately, there was a landslide on the road we were attempting to take, but he provided us with several alternative activities we could do. We ended up choosing to see more of Kathmandu and once again it was wonderful. Kedar could not have been kinder or friendlier to us and we have never been happier with a decision for a guiding agency. Kedar took a very hands on approach with us and always made sure we saw what we wanted and that we were enjoying our time in his wonderful country, even when he was not the one leading us around the city. Without a guide Kathmandu would likely be one of the most difficult cities to navigate around, but thankfully we had wonderful service and guides and our family cannot wait to return to Nepal!"

I felt really comfortable and he made sure I had the best accommodation and had everything I needed at all times (including running back to retrieve a forgotten towel drying at a guest house). On the trek I noticed that he was the only guide being friendly and sociabIe with me and the great people I met along the way. It was such a wonderful experience trekking with him, so many great memories and excellent value for money. Everyone recommends their guide but Kapil is really the best.

My review is on what I think makes the trip .... the company, the guide and the porter.My 61-year old friend and I had a unforgettable 10-day trek carefully planned by Nepal Hiking Team Pvt Ltd. From the time his staff picked us up to the time we said goodbye at the airport, the entire trip was perfect. This included water rafting and paragliding. Its Managing Director Ganga Raj Thapa was fast and efficient in his email response before and after the trip. I found the charges reasonable. He answered to all my questions and would accede to my requests if reasonable. In person, he's a warm and friendly man that you will feel comfortable with.The guide that he assigned, Narayan, was also very responsible. Very knowledgeable, informs us what to expect, very patient to wait for us 2 slow men. He took very good care of us, see to any of our needs... charge batteries, got us blankets, refill our bottles with water, be our camera man, he even holds my walking sticks or spectacles whenever I am taking pictures. He's very fit and could climb Everest, problem is that he doesn't have the money to do it.The porter, Lal, was just as amazing in his role. He could carry our stuff of 30kg for the entire 10 days, where we could easily trekked over 160km, ascended and descended over 15,000 stone steps, not forgetting the last stretch from MBC to ABC where oxygen level dropped to 50%. Despite all these, he is grateful that he has a job.Together they served us extremely well .. at meal times, they doubled up as waiters. At lunch, they ate their meals after us.. at dinner, they ate their meals .. after ALL the trekkers in the guest house had theirs .. and those trekkers are NOT even their customers.They did not sleep after we slept .. they slept only after ALL the trekkers in the guest house had slept .. and those trekkers are NOT even their customers .. because due to the lack of proper rooms, they can only sleep in the dining room.Our tips for them increased as each day passed. Hence dear trekkers, give generously when you are there, .. they deserved more.We may return to Nepal and although we can choose to do a different trek like the Everest Base Camp trek, we will definitely NOT choose a different company. Can change treks and cannot change company."

Weather was bit challenging and most of time it was cloudy in the high mountains. As such it was all about managing the trip. To make the money worth we initially took off for lukla. Then spend a night there. Next day tried to make it to Everest base camp but it was too cloudy so we spend more time at Everest hill hotel in the middle of the mountain range. Then when we had a good window we made it to base camp and had a clear view on the mountain. True , it's highly weather depended but we got lucky and the team did anything to increase the chances of the latter. Really enjoyed it: will try to come back and do the trek . Will choose them again."

            "review": "Everest Base Camp trip of a lifetime!. I have always wanted to explore the Himalayas and I couldn't dream of a better way to spend my time than with Nepal Hiking Team. As soon as we grabbed our bags from the airport in Kathmandu and headed out the door, we saw our guide ready to greet us. He took our bags and shuttled us to our hotel. That night we met Ganga to take care of the details of the trip. The following morning we had our tour of Kathmandu. My wife was feeling a little sick and halfway through the tour they took her back to the hotel with no questions asked.The trek was indescribable! Our guide, Basu, was amazing. He has the perfect balance of being professional while feeling like you are hiking with your best friend. Basu and our porters always made us feel like we were at home. Sometimes I wanted them to relax after a long day of hiking but as soon as we would reach a destination they would ask us what we wanted and take our lunch and dinner requests. They even brought our food out to us. There were never any issues if we wanted to to stop to take pictures or change in/out of a jacket. It was our trip and they made sure we knew it. I felt as though I made two new friends with our guide Basu and porter Santos. We taught each other how to play new card games and we learned a little Nepali language as well. Of course the mountains and the views were amazing, but this review is for the exceptional job that Nepal Hiking Team did. If you are looking for an EBC trip, look no further!!"

Our guide, Basu, was more like a friend than a guide while being professional and knowledgable of the Himalayan region. Both Basu and our porter Santosh, went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, well fed and having a good time. During the day they made sure we trekked at a safe pace and took as many breaks as needed. Every breakfast, lunch and dinner started with Basu and Santosh, taking our food order, serving us and getting us anything else we needed before they sat down to eat themselves. Most nights concluded with playing cards together and laughing around the dinner table. Throughout the trek we stayed at the nicest accommodations available, had hot showers when available and ate homemade food at all our hotel restaurants. The overall organization of our trek with NHP was also impressive. From the beginning the coordinator, Ganga was extremely helpful answering any questions or concerns we had. They also organized our airport pick-up and drop-off, plane ticket to Lukla, all our permits and a city tour with a local guide. If you are considering trekking in the Himalayans, Nepal Hiking Team is the best of the best! Thank you for everything!!!!"

NHT was wonderful supplying transportation to and from the airport, hotel, taking care of permits we needed and gave a tour of sites in Kathmandu. The climbing experience was amazing thanks to our professional and knowledgeable guide, Basu. He made the trip fun and we appreciated all he did for us. We felt like family from start to finish. During the decent I twisted my foot and Basu walked slowly with me making sure I was okay. We enjoyed the experience so much we're thinking of coming back in a year and climbing a different mountain. I would recommend NHT to anyone looking to trek in the Himalayas!"

I've had the pleasure of arranging an Annapurna trek route with Nepal Hiking Team first week of September and it was an absolute blast right from when I stepped foot in Nepal. I was warmly received by Ganga and my trek guide Suraj, the accommodation arranged were above my expectations and I was well taken care of by the team. Suraj is one of the most patient and meticulous guide I've met - he accommodated with all my requests and is very wary of my wellbeing throughout my trek. The Annapurna trek itself was amazing (and would have been even more awesome if the weather had been better) with a wide range of scenery from the villages to the waterfalls with the mountain range as the backdrop. All it all the organization was impeccable and I would definitely recommend anyone to take up a trekking package with Nepal Hiking Team, and if you do, remember to hit up Suraj."

I and a group of friends hiked in Nepal to Everest Base Camp and Cho La (pass) with The Nepal Hiking Team in May of 2016, and my son and I continued with the Nepal Hiking Team to trek to Everest Advances Base Camp via Tibet in June 2016.Both adventures were excellent, and the organisation and performance of the Nepal Hiking Team in arranging and carrying out the trek was of the highest order. I have trekked with them before on a number of occasions and I find that their performance just gets better and better.Their advice in planning and preparing for these treks was spot on - any question I asked was answered promptly and fully, and this was very useful for advising others in the group and helping us prepare ourselves for the treks. Gunga was our main in country contact and he met us at the airport and took care of us with transfers and briefings for the trek. He arranged everything - accommodation in Kathmandu (a good hotel in Thamel the main trekking quarter), guides and porters and transport to Lukla, the start of the trek. Our guide was Bhim, a tough and experienced man who was brilliant at assessing our physical and mental condition on the trek, and adjusting to ensure we all achieved our goals with enjoyment and satisfaction. One member of the group suffered altitude sickness. Bhim was very caring and shepherded the person as far as they were able to go, with medication and adjusting the schedule without detriment to others in the group. Bhim and Gunga organised the persons evacuation by helicopter when it became clear his condition was not improving. Again, their performance in this emergency was fantastic, and very reassuring for all concerned.It was a wonderful trek and we were able to leave everything to Nepal Hiking Team with confidence in them delivering.The trek to Advanced Base Camp via Tibet was likewise a very well organised and operated event. Personally I was pretty cautious about the trek, mainly the unknown emergency support facilities and the quality of the Tibetan guides (you have to employ one, that's the rules). The Nepal Hiking Team sourced all our requirements in Tibet, accommodation, guide, trekking permits etc, including arranging visas and flights to Lhasas - the whole lot. Also, Gunga sent Bhim as an extra (Nepalese) guide and this was really great because we knew him, and he is very skilled. This is the sort of care and consideration the Nepal Hiking Team puts into their arrangements, and I for one appreciated it very much. Again, with Bhim's help and guidance we were able to be flexible but still achieve our goals - a yak carrying our sleeping bags and tent fell through the ice on a glacier, and although rescued in good shape, it caused a delay and potentially threatened our schedule. Bhim consulted with us and suggested a changed schedule that was able to get us to Advanced Base Camp and back within our original time frame. Still a tough trek, but we got to see Mt Everest (as we call it) up close - a dream come true!So I have no hesitation in recommending The Nepal Hiking Team to any one contemplating a trek or other adventure in Nepal or Tibet. I have travelled with them on four occasions now, and they are great."

We were greeted by Ganga at the airport with a warm welcome. Ganga is a lovely genuine guy and wants you to feel comfortable. We were taken to our hotel and ran through the intinerary. The hotel was perfect and in a fab location, just at the top of the Thamel and everything from restaurants, shops, bars, German bakeries, cafes etc right on your doorstep. Our hotel jn Pohkara is was an excellent location aswell! The trek was the perfect amount of time for us! Our guide, Paban, looked after us from start to finish. He was very patient with us, a lovely guy and he had a real passion for trekking which was lovely to see. Couldn't have asked for a nicer guide! Our porter Lalman was also lovely and helped us along the way aswell! We felt very comfortable with them and we had an awesome time! We stayed in lovely guest/tea houses along the way which are standard but authentic and added to the whole trekking experience. All the guest houses are the same standard, some better than others. So if you're looking for luxury accommodation then maybe trekking isn't for you. Nepal Hiking Team choose the best ones and ones they have been using time and time again. We took the Poonhill Trek in August. I would recommend Nepal Hiking Team to everyone, amazing company and well run by lovely people! You'd be silly not to choose them! "

Nepal Hiking Team made sure our time in Nepal was exciting, safe, and completely enjoyable. We were a group of trekkers with mixed abilities and the guides accommodated slower trekkers with patience while still being able to challenge faster trekkers. Nepal Hiking Team's seamless planning of lovely accommodations and in-country travel took all the anxiety out of navigating in Nepal. The staff and guides worked with us to adjust the itinerary as we requested and always provided plenty of choices so we could customize our experience. Nepal Hiking Team's Balaram, Ganga, and our guide, Bhim, treated us like family, and we felt well taken care of all along. They embody the local knowledge one hopes to find when traveling abroad and do so with professionalism and great communication. The Himalayas are stunning, the villages of Nepal are beautiful, and trekking with Nepal Hiking Team added even more joy to the trip and greatly enhanced our experience. We would certainly come to this organization for future expeditions. We are still in touch with our guides and the staff of Nepal Hiking Team who made us feel at home in Nepal and who remain dear friends today."

Ganga replied to my emails promptly and answered all my questions with great details. We were blessed with amazing weather during our trek as it was in the middle of the monsoon season when we went. The sunrise at the base camp was definitely worth the 5.00am wake up for.The team even had sleeping bag and down jacket prepared for us so we didn't have to carry all the heavy stuff all the way from home.I must also mention about the meals we had which were surprisingly declicious, we were able to order anything we wanted. The food ranges from pizzas, salads sandwiches to nepali food.Looking forward to coming back to do the Everest Base Camp trek!"

This spring in March I have decided that by the end of April I want to go to Nepal and Bhutan for a one month travel. Usually such a trip needs to be planned in advance but for Nepal Hiking Team it was no problem to set all the necessities within a few days and off I went!My itinerary included: 3 days in Kathmandu, 20 day Mustang trekking with the Tiji festival and 5 day trip to Bhutan.And from the very beginning and warm welcome at the airport to the last goodbye I was pampered! Everything was well organized and I didn\u2018t have to take care of anything! I was just enjoying my time and if I had some suggestions or wishes the team was very flexible and change the programm according to me.The Mustang trek was amaizing and as it was my first trek ever I was very happy that it was not so dificult \u2013 average time of walking was arround 6 hours per day. My guide Santa was a professional taking a good care of me, always aware of my limits and capabilities and as also I found out with a huge experience in all kinds of situations. He is familiar with the whole area and he\u2019s also well known by the locals. Together with the porter Yamu they made a excelent couple to travel with and always with a big smile on thein face. After we\u2019ve reached the city of Lo-Manthang we stayed by the locals at their house which was an unforgetable experience and made me feel that I know Lo-Manthang since ever. The festival itself was also magical and I\u2019ve also enjoyed a lot the one day trip on a horse back to the Jhong cave.After this wonderful trek we\u2019ve return back to Kathmandu and the very next day I had my flight to Bhutan where another guide Dorji and his driver accompanied me during my whole stay. I was amazed by their knowledge of the history and culture of Bhutan and also they were very flexible if I wanted to make changes in my program. It was sad at the end to say goodbye to Balaram and Ganga but I\u2019m sure it was not the last time I was traveling with them and I can highly recommend to travel with Nepal Hiking Team!"

TREK TO UPPER MUSTANG REGION OF NEPAL WITH NEPAL HIKING TEAM \u2013 APRIL 2016With a friend we recently completed a most amazing trek to the restricted Upper Mustang Region of Nepal. We did the trek with the Nepal Hiking Team, a Nepalese trekking company based in Kathmandu. This was my second trek to the Upper Mustang region with Nepal Hiking Team. Both times that I have used them I found that my trips were well organized and everything was done very efficiently. On my first trek to the region I did the standard up and back trek to Lo Mathang, the ancient capital city of the region. The trek was a wonderful adventure that made me well aware of a very different region of Nepal, instead of mountains and forest, it is an area of high desert, ancient Tibetan culture and villages.On returning home I read the book, Mustang, A Lost Tibetan Kingdom, written by Michel Peissel. A book which he wrote in the 1960s about the people and his travels throughout of the region. At this time I became more and more interested in returning for another trek to the Upper Mustang region to one of the less travelled and a different area.I decided that I wanted to return to Upper Mustang. I contacted Nepal Hiking Team and Ganga by email with regards to a trek to the Upper Mustang region. I wanted a trek that was different than my previous trek. This time I proposed a trek to the area on the east side of the Kali Gandaki River. The first part of the trek up to Lo Manthang, would be up the west side of the Kali Gandaki River and then back down the east side. which would be a much harder and more difficult route. I also wanted to visit Ramchang Cave Monastery as well as Drakmar and the 8th century Ghar Gekarn our way to Lo Manthang. On the return to Jomson overnight at Yara and day trek to Luri Gompa and the Tashi Kambum. From Yara trek and overnights in Tangge and Tetang. From Tetang we would trek to Jharkot via Muktinath. From Jharkot to Johmson we would go via the old Bonn village of Lupra.I emailed Nepal Hiking Team with my proposal, Ganga responded to our proposal and questions. All the emails that I sent were always responded too within a few minutes. He accepted our proposed program which met our requests and all our requirements. I made air bookings and made the booking for the trek. We had to make some changes to our program because of air flight changes, the program and hotel booking changes were made with no problems.Despite that our flight arrival in Kathmandu had been delayed by 6 hours we met on by our porter, Santa, he was standing outside the arrival area with a large visible sign, he assisted us through the crowd and took us to the waiting car. He was also very helpful at the hotel. We met with Ganga the next morning who gave us a comprehensive brief and answered questions about our trek. Ganga with our guide came to the hotel the next day to deliver, Nepal Hiking Team duffle bags and a sleeping bag and jacket for my companion, we were able to keep the duffle bags. Both the sleeping bag and jacket were in good condition and suitable for cold weather.On our departure from Kathmandu our guide took us by car to the bus for our trip to Pokhara, on arrival in Pokhara he got us a taxi and to the hotel. The next day we had an early morning flight to Jomson.On arrival in Jomson we met Vishnu, our porter. He would be carrying our two duffle bags. After a late breakfast we set out.Without going into all the details of the trek. The region on the west side of the Kali Gandaki River is very isolated high desert with very few people, other than in the small villages. We only saw two other trekkers between Lo Manthang and Muktinath and an occasional goat herder. The trails had many long steep uphills and downhills, at times were narrow and sometimes sand covered, often the downhills were covered in loose rock scree. We did see the occasional coloured trail marker and sign. We found that Santa was a very excellent guide, he was familiar with the areas that we trekked, he looked after us very well, always assuring about or safety and wellbeing. Our porter, Vishnu, was outstanding and strong. Both the porter and the guide were wonderful people and were great to be with. They had fresh fruit for us at our evening meal every night which they carried throughout the trek.I hope that someday that I will be able to return to Nepal to trek again and certainly I would book and go with Nepal Hiking Team. I would highly recommend that anyone considering travels to Nepal for a trek or just a visit to contact them.Thanks again Nepal Hiking TeamGarfield Saunders (Age 77)Victoria BC, Canada"

They cater for all and their guides and porters do a fantastic job.I first used Nepal Hiking Team in 2011 when I went on my own with a guide on the Gokyo, Cho La, EBC trek. From the time I touched down in Kathmandu, crossing Cho La and up to EBC and back It couldn't have gone better which inspired me to return in 2012 with my 12 year old son to embark on the Everest High Passes trek. Again NHT where absolutely fantastic ensuring everything went well and leaving no stone unturned. Our guide, DC Raj made all the right decisions when it mattered most which meant we had great success crossing Cho La again, Rengo La, reaching EBC and the top of Kalar Patar and Gokyo Ri. I new my son (who still talks about it as if it was yesterday) and I where in the best hands and the results speak for themselves. Jacki and I have now just returned from successfully completing the Annapurna Circuit including crossing the Thorong La at 5416m. We are both in our 50's now and it was DC Raj again who guided us throughout the trek with no problems at all. Ganga and Balaram do an outstanding job managing your holiday from the time you make your first enquiry and to the time you depart thinking about when you'll be back again. We will certainly be heading back to the beautiful country of Nepal and without question we'll be using Nepal Hiking Team for any type of adventure we choose.

It was disappointing but that's the way things go sometimes....Ganga provided us with very personal service, welcomed us from airport on the first day and farewelled us at the airport on the last day. That's service!The initial hotel he provided us wasn't very good but he gave us another hotel in KMT which was very very nice.During our trek, the guest house we stayed at was pretty good but only one guest house at Namche Buzar had a hot shower. Although the itinerary they provided us said that 3 guest houses during the trek should have hot showers.When my husband had altitude sickness at Gorek Shep the guide Ganga took care of him very well. He recovered next day and was able to continue the trek.Overall, Nepal hiking team provided us very good service and I would recommend the company to anyone who is thinking of going to Nepal."

Finding Nepal Hiking Team on the Internet helped allay the fears immediately. Initially I had another trekking company in mind. Ganga soon won me over with his prompt email responses and Skype calls. He was very willing to work with me as an individual with a few concerns I had. His service is exceptional. He will bend over backward to ensure the client has a flawless experience. I had exactly 33 days in Nepal. I wanted to do the Everest Base Camp and the Annapurna Circuit. He arranged everything. The package is comprehensive including meet and greet at the airport complete with lei greeting, flights into and out of Lukla, transportation to and from the Annapurna region, day tour of Kathmandu, lodging, most meals, and the wonderful support services of my guide, Ram. I simply could not have been more pleased. My guide, Ram, was way way more than just a guide. He was also a personal assistant and friend. He took the time to point out points of interest along the way. He was willing to engage in discussions on Nepalese culture. Lastly, when I succumbed to a nasty respiratory infection a few days before the end of my Annapurna trek, I found Ganga and Ram very sympathetic. They were willing to rearrange the last few days of my trek allowing me to return to Kahmandu to recover before returning home. I am very very pleased with the all the personal service provided to me. I recommend them highly and look forward to booking with them again."

It is my pleasure to recognize the outstanding service the owners and staff of \u201cNepal Hiking Team\u201d provided me during my trip to Nepal in April \u2013 May, 2016. The co-owner Ganga is a very professional and sincere business man. He put my interests and concerns first. He has good relationships with other business professionals (i.e. hotel managers) which helped facilitate great tours and hotel accommodations. I want to also share my gratitude for Ganga and my guides (Anuj and Nararyan) for their immense support in helping me find my luggage which was lost for 3.5 days. I was so happy that we were able to get to the airport in time to claim my luggage on the last flight that came in before I left for the Everest Base Camp trek. I want to express my great appreciation for my Everest Base Camp guide, Nararyan. I successfully reached Everest Base Camp and could have never done it without Nararyan\u2019s assistance. I have a weak left ankle and poor balance. I found Nararyan to be a very patient, compassionate, positive, and considerate gentleman and a joy to be around. He went above and beyond to prevent me from getting injured. Nararyan kept a close eye on me at all times and every time the trek was challenging he was right there to offer extra assistance without me asking. My climb to Everest Base Camp was one of the most fascinating experiences in my life and it will live with me forever! A big applause goes to \u201cNepal Hiking Team\u201d and my guide, Nararyan. There is no doubt in my mind that the owners and staff of \u201cNepal Hiking Team\u201d care for each and every one of their clients."

I traveled solo and you were always there from advising me on things to buy and also taking care of me and all my queries during my trek. When i had blisters and walked with so much pain, you always made jokes to make me feel better. Every time i come to Nepal, i'm definitely only going to request for you to be my guide! Definitely the best. Nepal hiking team is amazing and everyone showed more care than interest in money which i found very amazing and different from other trekking companies. They always prioritized my safety, food and made sure i was always contented with everything. They definitely give a very good service and their prices are also of the best. I had met a few people on the trek as well and Nepal hiking team had the best price and package to offer. Ganga and Balaram personally sent and fetch me from the airport and they always had lovely greetings and farewells. My trip went very well because i made the decision to go with Nepal Hiking team. Its really important to find the right trekking company and i especially recommend them as they were more interested in my well being and to enjoy my stay in Nepal more than anything else. I would definitely come bk to Nepal for more treks and will choose a package with Nepal hiking team.

Mr Ganga and his team were truly professional on all counts, very responsive in dealing with our requests and providing exceptional attention to detail from start to finish. We were even provided an additional guide should we have problems with the children but we only nearly needed this once when our youngest was sick for a day. Accomodation on route was never disapointing and the food was as good as you could except on a trek with the team always there to support and provide assistance where necessary. We got to Annapurna Base camp and back as a team and we will always remember this and a big thank you to the Nepal Hiking Team.

He looked after me well, made sure that I was feeling ok, I did not get altitude sickness, because I walked ever so slow. On the first day, I was not sure to go ahead as it was only me but they told me that I will meet people all the way and it was true. I enjoyed it and I will never forget about this trip. I like the people, the country, mountains, scenery and food. Thank you Arun for a good memory and encouraged me to walked all the way to Annapurna Base Camp. I made it to the base camp."

Ganga was very helpful and flexible with us in planning our trip. Our guide Basu, and our porter Gobinda, really made our trip memorable. Ganga responded to all our needs, and the trip could not have been better. The guest houses were very comfortable, and the meals were excellent, much better than I expected. And the most beautiful country I have ever seen. The mountains are spectacular. September was a good time to go, weather was great, trails were not crowded probably due to earthquake fallout. If you are looking for the trek of a lifetime, go to Everest Base Camp and use Nepal Hiking Team. I highly recommend their service."

Just got back from Nepal a couple of days ago, where partner and I were doing an Everest region trek assisted by Nepal Hiking Team. Their service couldn't have been better. I started planning this trip last Spring and looked at numerous trekking companies. Chose NHT due to the tremendously positive reviews on them, the professionalism of their website, and the quick response I got from Ganga when I sent an initial inquiry via their website -- he phoned me within a few hours, apparently as soon as morning had come round to Nepal (given the time difference between North America and Nepal). He was extremely helpful and responsive from the start, all the way through completion of our trek and last couple of days back in Kathmandu. Our guide for the trek, Bhim, couldn't have been more helpful and took very good care of us and kept us safe. The whole operation and experience couldn't have been more positive."

We booked the week before our trip and Nepal Hiking Team responded within 30 min. They helped customized our 8 day itinerary further as we wanted a paragliding segment. Our guide Deepak and our Porter Prem were amazing. Deepak helped us further customize our itinerary each day depending on how much energy we think we had, and especially after I sprained my knee. Deepak was also super helpful when we came down and I had very little balance. Ganga, the CEO, also came down to meet us personally twice at our hotel while we were in Kathmandu, to check if we were comfortable with the programme and to close off and see how we were doing after the trek. Thank you Nepal Hiking Team for making this an amazing holiday for us."

As a number of people have inquired about the Annapurna/Dhaulagiri Panorama trek, here\u2019s a brief outline of the route:You follow the exact same route to Ghorepani/Poon Hill but then you deviate from there.As you head downhill from Ghorepani the next morning, after 30-45 min. you take a trail to your right that leads down into the valley instead of following the normal trail out toward the main Annapurna Circuit trail.This trail descends down into the valley bottom through villages and rice fields from where you catch another trail that takes you zig-zagging up the ridge to Khopra Dande (3600m) on the opposite side of the valley.At Khopra Dande, you\u2019ll spend the night and have the option of doing a full-day hike the next day to a lake (Khayer Lake) at the foot of Annapurna South. If the weather is good and you have the time, I would take at least one full day at Khopra to enjoy the views and hike around farther up the ridge.Leaving Khopra, there is a trail that follows the ridge line down (a different trail than the one you came up), passing through other villages and finally arriving at Tatopani, which is along the main Annapurna Circuit route.From Tatopani, it\u2019s easy to catch a bus back to Pokhara (although you\u2019ll have to switch buses at some point and possibly share a microvan). Tatopani also has outdoor developed hot springs, but don\u2019t get too excited."

First off I'm so glad we chose Nepal Hiking Team as I had a lot of concern about who to travel with in Nepal. Ganga, Balaram, and our guide Arun were very professional and caring throughout. A very large amount of snow had fallen while visiting, and our guide Arun did an amazing job of keeping us safe while still allowing for great exploration.We started early and made our way out of Namche. The initial climb is quite steep, but Arun helped pace us so we didn't exhaust ourselves. The view as you make your way towards the Everest View Hotel is just breathtaking, so we made plenty of stops for pictures. Throughout the hike we learned a huge amount from Arun about the local customs and Buddhist traditions. We stopped for tea at Everest View, took pictures, and enjoyed the scenery. Everest, Lhotse, and Ama Dablam made for the perfect panorama.Around 11:00 we headed down the hill to Khumjung for lunch. We stopped at a local tea house for what I consider the absolute best pizza we had while in the Khumbu. Not an easy feat considering the altitude, but regardless of wherever we went the food was always tasty. After lunch we got to see the school that Edmund Hillary established before making our way back towards Namche. It was a phenomenal day trip, and I was so glad we got experience the best of the Himalayas with Arun's help. Mark F."

Before embarking on our adventure, all enquiries were always promptly replied and every question answered in great detail, which helped put our minds at ease well before we arrived. We were also pleased at how seriously they take altitude sickness issues and safety, and are extremely competent and experienced at checking for the signs. Our guide was very accommodating to all our needs and creature comforts and went out of his way to ensure we had the best time. We had the adventure of our lives thanks to Nepal Hiking Team, and will definitely be back to Nepal sometime in the future to do more trekking and will only be using the professional friendly crew of Nepal Hiking Team. Thanks guys."

The organisation once we were in Nepal was great and we had a lovely few days walking - our guide and the porters were excellent and looked after us perfectly. I would be happy to recommend the company to friends and will hopefully get the chance to use their services again as we would like to return!"

            "review": "NHT were so reliable! Generally outstanding!. We booked our trip from Australia. So it was already a hard decision to make as we had to put a lot of trust in a company. We started with 12 companies and slowly over the course of a week got down to just our preferred, which was of course NHT. We selected them because they were in the top 3 prices (but not the cheapest) and Ganga was so extremely responsive and thorough in his English email replies. He also gave us real people that we could email and ask them questions about their experiences. We had Prakash Rai as our guide and he was such a pleasurable person to be around. He was so friendly, caring, and was always smiling and laughing. He also taught us a lot of Nepalese language along the way. Both NHT and Prakash were literally perfect and we would highly recommend using their services to anyone that wants to listen. I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have via a message or email. Just ask Ganga for my email address."

            "review": "highly recommended... My partner and I had an amazing time in Nepal and largely due to the professional help from Hari, Ganga and the whole Nepal Hiking Team. Expect a collection from the airport with a big welcome smile along with other local assistance outside of your tour or expectations. We could not fault the package that they put together with us, we had a very knowledgable and helpful guide and all the logistics were in place without a hiccup. I can honetly say that I will be staying in touch with these guys and will most certainly be booking the next trip with them on our return to Nepal!"

Ganga was quick to respond and easy to deal with. the trek was also relatively affordable compared to other companies. Nothing was too difficult for Ganga and the itinerary was clear. Our guide was Bhim. He was very kind and patient and with good humour laughed with me as I struggled up the trek. He knew what he was doing and we felt safe with him. I would recommend Nepal Hiking Team to anyone."

            "review": "Wonderful Cultural Tour. Ganga (or Raj) came through and met our highest level of expectation. Ganga arranged our tour in a manner that we were able to maximize the limited amount of time that we had to visit Kathmandu. At first, we were naturally apprehensive about wiring money to a complete stranger half-way around the world based on a promise typed up on e-mails so we relied on testimonials from others. However, we trusted the testimonials, went with our guts and were very pleased with the outcome. Excluding the hotel arrangement, which we made separately, Ganga made all the tour arrangements. He personally greeted us at the airport upon arrival. Khumar the tour guide was amazingly patient and knowledgeable about the sites around Kathmandu, its history, palace and temple designs and architecture, culture, etc. The driver was very cool during the traffic jams and craziest Nepali driving style. And at the end of our visit, Ganga joined us for the cultural dinner and accompanied us to the airport the following day. He also arranged the Everest flyby in a way that the entire day was maximized for other activities. By the way, NHT price was also very competitive. Without any hesitation, I would highly recommend Ganga and NHT. Credit Ganga for his arrangements and attention to detail, we had an excellent but limited time in Kathmandu to the extent that we will contact him again should we return to Nepal."

I was looking forward to a great time hiking on the Himalayas, and left everything on their hands, and they did superb. All the tour and travel practicalities were taken care of by them, and during the trek, our main job was to walk... they handled the rest! The guides also proved excellent knowledge of the area and were very capable of answering all our \"tourist\" questions. Good personal touch as well. Without a doubt, I would take this trip again with them any time."
