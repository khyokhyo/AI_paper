After crossing the Danube from the Chain Bridge, we took a slope upward (Sikl\u00f3 u.) for a casual 20-min walk via Medieval bastion \"Rondella\" to the Buda Caslte. The views along the way was nice. The Castle itself was just magnificent. It's just too bad that we arrived too late for the art gallery and the museum. Nevertheless, the court and the garden and the views were just so wonderful."

Many of the buildings were destroyed throughout the years but there is still quite a lot to see. Stroll along the streets and admire many monuments of past kings, the Fisherman's Bastion, Matthias church, the Holy Trinity column, the National Gallery, the History Museum etc...you can watch the funicular in action. You can admire the many souvenir shops, cafes, restaurants and hotels. Take breath taking pictures of the marvelous views from the top. It's worth a visit!!!"

The easiest (and most fun!) way to get to it is via the funicular, although you can walk ~30min up the hill, but for the ~3 euro fee it's worth it.The views are stunning from the walls, you can see a long way up and down the river. The statues and buildings are beautiful to see up close, and there are museums within the structure that you can visit (for an extra fee). Only thing to note is that some of the walkways are a bit narrow, but they have handrails and feel sturdy, so even people who don't like heights should be fine. There are also lifts to get up and down the different levels."

It is the former residence of Hungarian Kings but is now home to the National Gallery, Budapest History Museum, National Szechenyl Library, which bother the Lion's Courtyard, the central courtyard of the castle. The Lion's Gate gives entrance to the courtyard, is monumental and is crowned by the Hungarian Crest. Steps away from this gate is the Matthias fountain, a favourite spot of photographers. The Natiaonal Gallery has a comprehensive collection of Hungarian artwork from the Middle Ages to the present day. Budapest history museum covers the history of Budapest from prehistory to modern times. The National Szechenyi Library holds a copy of every book published in Hungary. Do look out for the statue of a large bird perched atop a tall pedestal , the mythical Turul bird of death, a symbol of the kingdom of Hungary. Do also keep a look out for other statues and fountains in and around the garden."

As it was located uphill, thus it has the advantage of having panoramic views over nearly the whole city. After crossing the Chain Bridge, you could either walk uphill or use the funicular. We were early enough this time (9 am) to see the \"change of guards\" performance at the entrance and tour around the castle taking pictures on all the statues around as well as the scenes on the other side of River Danube prior to proceed to the Fisherman's Bastion.

You step out to a wonderful vista and access to the Castle. You walk down, but we took the funicular no queuse going down. My wife's knees and mine aren't what they used to be."

To get to the top, you can walk it, but it is very steep...or take the funicular...or just take a cab from your hotel and they will drop you off at the top. We opted to walk down which was easy and enjoyable. After we were dropped off, we explored the Fisherman's Bastion, a beautiful and fairytale like terrace to see great views of the Pest side of Budapest. From here we walked around Matthias Church with an ornate roof. From here we wandered into the residential area that includes lots of shops. I highly recommend Litea: Literature & Tea Bookshop. The manager was so nice and so helpful. My mother found lots of great books about Hungary. I found beautiful prints from children book illustrator Karoly Reich. From here we wandered into the castle grounds. I highly recommend a self guided tour found in most tour books and online...this will point out and explain the many beautiful statues and sights you will come across. The interior of the castle is now museums including history and art. There is no fee to wander the castle grounds and surrounding area, but there is for the museums. There were lots of restaurants from elegant sit down to gelato to a Starbucks. We did have difficulty finding a public restroom. We had no difficulty walking down from Castle Hill, but it looked like a hard walk up...take a cab or the funicular. There are tons of photo ops of Buda and Pest so don't forget your camera!"

BUT its not a castle, its a palace, IMHO. And its difficult to get into. The part we managed to access contained an art gallery, so we backed off. And we just could not find the treasury, which was one part I still wanted to visit, after we found out it was not really a castle. Its also quite a way up the hill (we passed a funicular at one point). We walked uphill a lot, we walked across a lot, we never really found what we were looking for, so for us a waste of valuable time."

I expected it to help clarify the history of Budapest (since its many occupations can get confusing) but the interior of Buda Castle is really just a museum about the actual building\u2014which, for the record, has also been occupied and destroyed numerous times. The exhibits themselves are really dull (and this is coming from a person who usually LOVES musuems) and we wandered around for a while, but really didn't get a lot of the experience. It was really inexpensive to visit, so nothing lost, but still, I'd spend my time elsewhere. It's also worth noting that the national art museum is housed in a separate section of the castle. Also, the monestary that was next door is undergoing a major renovation, so it's closed."

The panoramic views of the Danube and the Pest side of the town, especially the Parliament and the Chain Bridge, were spectacular. The architecture is also very impressive. Formerly home to the Hungarian kings (like Mel Brooks said, \"it's nice to be King\"), this amazing palace is now home to the Hungarian National Gallery. The art museum itself could use some remodeling to make to improve the flow and the looks (looked a bit \"sovietish\" inside) and I was not particularly impressed by the art, mostly Hungarian. But the Modigliani temporary exhibit was outstanding. The audio self guide, available in many languages, was great.The castle is also located in a hill full of restaurants, bars, galleries, and shops, which can be combined into a packed half day of visits, at least. The only drawback was the multitude of tourists. Even in mid-September the area was PACKED, so be ready to fight crowds and long lines."

My partner and I did not go inside the castle, but opted to purely enjoy the outdoor experience surrounding the castle.Apart from the wonderful views over the Danube, and the Pest side of Budapest, the areas surrounding the castle are actually very pleasant, with amazing colonnades, and pedestrian areas. a series of paths and plazas takes you around the castle complex itself, and then eventually takes you back down to the river level again. For those with some disabilities, there are elevators available that can lift you from river level, to the high plaza area near to the front of the main castle complex.Alternatively, for others, you can take the long sloping roadway, that comes up from near to the Funicular Tram station... this tram also being yet another means of getting to the top, although there is a fee to use the funicular tram, whereas the lifts a the far opposite end of the castle complex are free.There is a lot to see just walking around the castle surrounds without ever going inside, which would be another experience. As mentioned, we did not go inside the castle, which I believe incurs an entrance fee. But you can spend at least an hour or two for free just walking around the various levels of the grounds and plazas that surround the castle. This is definitely one of the special places to visit when you are in Budapest."

Quite impressive architecture and views of Pest on the way up and the entire city once on top.The walking tour guide reminded us about the tourist trap pricey restaurants in the area, and that the tram/gondola isn't really worth the price of walking up,What got me was that the bathrooms at the bottom and top are 200 FT or 1 Euro in coin! Bring some.Do stop on your way up and on top and snap photos. Assuming you'll go on a clear day, you'll get some stunning views.I'd rate Gellert Hill/Citadel and possibly Parliament as potential higher priorities if you are stretched for time."

It is more than sufficient, however, to simply sit with an ice-cream at the castles cafe and gaze upon the spectacular views of a beautiful city, rising from the turquoise waters of the Danube or weave your way around the various gardens and grounds the castle has accessible free of charge. Would definitely recommend going on a day that is not a Monday in order to avail of all that the castle has to offer, also, bring coin change due to the fact that, similar to elsewhere in Budapest, you can expect to pay a small fee to use the WC facilities."

Buda Castle is very nice but to me the Palace, while very attractive, is best viewed from a distance where it dominates Castle Hill. The best parts of the overall castle are Matthias Church, the Military History Museum and the various lookout points, especially Fisherman's Bastion. From Buda Castle you have a great view of Parliament, St Stephens Basilica and all of Pest. Be sure to catch the changing of the guard that takes place on the hour every hour (believe starting at 1000). Best viewing point is in the small square between the Palace and the top funicular station. Buda Castle is reached by either walking up the many paths leading to Castle Hill, the public bus from Szell Kalman ter or, the best option, via the funicular at the foot of the Chain Bridge."

We were lucky to see the temporary exhibitions of Picasso and Modigliani at the Art museum, but the museum also offers a wide collection of Hungarian art. The history museum of Budapest also is suggested for its wide collection of information. But please note that it is more a museum of history of Buda castle and what is important to be noted is that the underground is actually the remains of the original Buda castle. It represents the medieval part of the castle which remained intact."

I live in the shadow of Buda Castle and it is like my back yard....It can be approached in many ways..The Fernicular Railway at Clark Adam Square ..A No 16 Bus from Clarke Adam Square but it can also be accessed on the Pest side of the river..or a 15 minutes walk passing a few coffee stops..The Castle district extends from the Fishermens bastion to a descent into the wonderful new gardens of the Varkert Bazaar..Mathias Church is perhaps one of the great gems and not to be missed..There are delightful antique shops in the small alleyways but you need to consult the latest tourist calendar for the many events that occur through the season..The balustrades overlooking the city and river laid out below is the perfect photo opportunity . Statues and monuments dominate the whole area..On most days apart from Monday there is the National Museum and as I write (June 2016) there is a wonderful Picasso exhibition..It is a riot of rococo statues and fountains..and worth any effort you may take to arrive there..There are often concerts in the grand theatre which will be advertised in the many information desks.There is a restaurant overlooking the panoramic views ..All in all it is a venue that you must include in your itinerary..PS Night time is a magical time to visit.."

You just can't miss the views from up on high and there is no need to queue and pay for the funicular nor walk up the hill.Thanks to some local knowledge shared by two Scot lassies we rode two lifts and an escalator to the top.After you walk across the chain bridge and are looking at the funicular, turn left and walk 200 meters approx past some bars till you see multiple archways. One will have a glass elevator which goes up one floor. Exit that and you'll see an escalator which takes you higher. Get off that and walk straight ahead into a wooden vestibule and take the lift one more floor and there you are. Right at the top. Enjoy the views etc."

The first castle was built on the hill around the year 1200, as protection from the Mongols attacks. Over the centuries, several other castles were built to serve as residences or fortresses of the rulers, but were subsequently destroyed by oppressors, during the attacks of the World War II and the Hungarian Revolution. The reconstruction took place during the second half of the 20th century and created the current structure of 300 meters. Besides being home of the Royal Palace, also places the History Museum and the National Gallery. I visited both and I must say it\u2019s quite interesting. Inside the museum, you can see caves from medieval times, a bit claustrophobic\u2026 Walk around the surroundings to see the gardens, the statues and the neighborhood that still retains traces of the Middle Ages. One of the highlights is the view of the Danube River, which runs through the city, and the beautiful Chain Bridge in front of the luxury hotel Four Seasons. From there you can walk to the Gellert Hill, to see Citadel and all its splendor. To get to the Castle, you can go walking, and then you will be losing some pounds due to the heavy food you\u2019ve been eating since you arrived at the city, or, take the charming cable railway, right in front of the Chain Bridge. I did this ;p"

The castle and the palace complex used to house the Hungarian royalties and what gorgeous architecture! Buda Castle is worth the visit to simply walk around, enjoying the amazing buildings, the court yard, statues and splendid views. After walking over the chain bridge from Pest to Buda you are faced with the choice of going up Buda funicular or taking the steps.I chose the funicular wich costs 1800 forintas for up and down. Quick and smoooth. This brings you to castle hill where I strolled around taking in the beautiful architecture and atmosphere.There was a Picasso exhibition in Buda Castle during my visit, that I viewed quickly - one of my favorite artist and I enjoyed it tremendously. Heads up - lots of cobbled street, so please wear sensible shoes!"

Very easy to spend a good few hours wandering around the medieval castle and square. The cathedral is also a masterpiece (see my pics). This area really is like no other in Europe. I visited a couple of days ago and the sky was really blue, it felt like a movie set. If you're a history buff or just appreciate beautiful architecture then you won't be disappointed. There are lovely little 'french-style' patisseries and cafes (or maybe I shouldn't say french, but 'Hungarian-style'). Regardless, the cafes offer delicious pastries and world-class coffee. I stopped by Ruszwurm and had an espresso and their signature 'vanilla cream cake'. The pastries are really incredible at Ruszwurm and the coffee is lovely, a great little pick-me-up while you explore the beautiful surroundings further. I noticed just down from Ruszwurm there was a soup cafe with those big bread-bowl soups, next time I go I will try the soup, they looked delicious as well."

The Buda Castle is one of my top places in Budapest.Located by the banks of the Danube river, the castle has had a very long history and has been expanded many times throughout history.Unless you're in a rush, taking the funicular to get to the top of the hill where the castle is located is not something I would suggest. The castle can be accessed from the back of the hill, as well as from the bottom for free. Walking will allow you to grasp the majestic of the whole walled area and it may only take 5 to 10 minutes to get to the top. You can enjoy the view towards the Danube river, the Parliament as well as the Liberty Statue. Using the funicular would take 1 minute or less, plus the waiting time, which I'm assuming would be close to 5 minutes.Entrance to the actual castle was not very expensive and is worth it if you're interested in the history behind it."

If you'd like to see them all plan on spending more than 3 hours. Even if you skip the inside of the building, it's still an amazing place to walk around.You could easily walk up the hill or ride the Castle Hill Funicular (tram). I recommend walking at least one way. The cobble stone path leading to the top offers some great photo ops! Make sure you walk around the back of the building to take in all that the area has to offer.Truly one of the most beautiful sites in Budapest."

At the famous Fishermans Bastion, you will see one of the most beautiful views of Budapest.The Budapest market is worth a visit, it is an amazing 19th century building with high metal columns, walkways & ramps. So many different varieties of food. Budapest zoo, the famous Gundel restaurant, and amusement park and the amazing Szecheny, baths are all contained in the City Park.

Due to time and my interest being more of history we chose the latter. Approx \u00a34 each entry here.The museum is a labyrinth of passages and floors taking you from the medieval history of the hill, the city and the archaeological digs that helped re-discover the story of it all through to the more recent years that tell of the German occupation and then Soviet control of the country.I would say we easily spent 90 minutes in all taking in the story and exhibits and it is well worth the visit.Afterwards take a walk around the walls and get a good view of the Buda side and it is chalk and cheese from the Pest side.On a nicer day we could have walked the top of the hill to various sites and statues but alas the rain dictated that lunch was preferable and time to dry out!"

It doesn't cost any money to see the outside, and we did not go inside, so I cannot comment on that.We went up the the Buda Castle on our first night in Budapest to get a feel for the city and to be able to see the city from one of the highest points possible. I've always felt you can see so much more from above than from the ground. The castle sits right on the edge of the cliffs, so you can get great views of the Pest side and see all the famous buildings and sprawling city.The Budapest Wine Festival was going on at Buda Castle while we were there, which added to the magic of the castle. Make sure to plan time to stroll around the grounds and look at the beautiful buildings, fountains and architecture. Take time to just hang over the walls and see the river and city below. Buda Castle cannot be missed when in Budapest. It is spectacular and one of the most beautiful buildings in Europe. Add this to your itinerary. And make sure you eat a delicious langos in Clark Adam Square at the base of the funicular. The lady who makes them is incredible and clearly loves her craft."

You can see the whole city and there is a big bird watching down on it. Exceptionally cold in the winter we were there -12 degrees Celsius and cause it's very high up it is truly freezing."

Loved Buda Castle - walked over the Chain bridge and took a trip up via the Funicular railway, only because we knew we would be on our feet for most of the day, and I use a stick. Pricey trip. However you arrive right outside the gates of the castle. There are lots of huts selling mulled wine, coffee and hot chocolates. However we went into the building and bought our tickets to see the art gallery.Firstly we dispensed with our coats and went into the cafe. Nice coffee, hot chocolate and snacks which were reasonably priced. You can use the toilets here, free if you show your entrance tickets, if not you have to pay.The gallery is well laid out and houses a vast collection of Hungarian art over several floors. There is a lift here and lots of seating around the building. The staff are incredibly pleasant and helpful. Again, the architecture here is as much an art form as the paintings, sculptures etc. My partner is not as enthusiastic about galleries as I am but he was wowed by most of the collections. Also the views from the Windows just adds to the pleasure and experience of Budapest. You get so much for your money for a visit here! And on so many levels, literally. We walked around the grounds, took lots of photographs as the opportunities of finding different angles are endless! We finished and went back down on the curricular train then turned right at the bottom and ascended the path back up towards the castle but ventured along the contour of the hill, dropped down into some gardens and followed these to the end, walked across the bridge, got a tram back to the Parliament buildings. But a spectacular day out!"

A major tourist attraction, the castle is situated on top of a hill, providing a panoramic view of the Hungarian Parliament on the opposite banks of the Danube River. Give yourself at least two hours to explore the Castle complex and take all those wonderful selfies and panoramic shots of the spectacular views including the Szechenyi Chain Bridge \u2013 one the few bridges that connects the two halves of the city. And depending on how ambitious you might feel on the day, you can walk to the next hill and explore the Fisherman\u2019s Bastion & St Matthias Church or make your way down and visit the Calvinist Church. You can pack a lot in one day with many of these sites being within close proximity of each other.

So highly recommend you check when they open if the primary reason going to Buda Castle is for the gigantic art museum. People here outside (locals) were nice to us tourists when we asked questions in english.Good thing about coming here on the wrong day (early ish, 10 in the morning) was that none of the other tourist groups were there yet so perfect time to take solo pics with the Matthias fountain (majestic and so antique), the courtyard lion statues two of them roaring two of them not roaring (there's a backstory to that I believe), the terrified horse statue (sorry, it has a real name, just can't recall)...etc Just loads of history. Don't miss the giant bird statue (it's on the cliff side, hard to get a good angle) if you look closely it looks a bit like a vulture. Apparently it's a \"Turul\" or some mythical bird of death in Hungarian culture. Very cool.Also, most museums in budapest charge you extra for a photo permit, to allow you to take pics inside. Some of the folks inside can be very nasty about it. (Not saying it's this one obviously since I went there when they weren't open) but basically each time you walk into a room holding a camera/smartphone they'll ask for the permit. And even when you have the permit, if they don't see if on you they will walk in front of you right when you're taking a picture and try to snatch your phone away. Some museums were more chill about it. Just a warning.."

You can also see the official residence of the president (from the outside, not open to the public) and walk around the battlements and admire the view. We paid to enter the castle museum in the basement which began as an interesting exploration of the cellars and archaeological finds from the area and ascended through grand staircases at the centre of the castle to find several more floors giving a detailed history of the building and the life of Budapest. The central floor houses a beautiful atrium and there was a fantastic exhibition on St. Matthias' church. On the top floor exhibits track the political and social life of the city through out the twentieth century. All interesting stuff.There is also a quirky cafe selling canned beer and filled rolls"

Getting up is easy, just walk across the Chain Bridge and either take the furnicular or walk a short distance up the hill. The furnicular is an interesting contraption, but the ride is short and the queue can be long. The Castle itself gives fantastic views of Budapest and it is nice to walk about the courtyard and drink forralt bor, the local version of gl\u00fchwein. At the far end are the medieval remains, and these bring you back to an age with princesses and dragons and are a good way to start in the museum. Pay the 2000 HUF admission ticket and work your way up. To see it all you will need a couple of hours. Many interesting things to see, but sadly not all the plaques and descriptions are translated into English. "

Csontvary was active in the early 20th century, and painted several huge canvasses in a pseudo-naive style and using extremely bold colours - somewhere between the post-impressionists and the Fauves. The building is obviously not an exhibition hall, the connecting corridors are positively claustrophobic, and many rooms are too small for the paintings that are on display, but most of them can breath. An artist of cult status in Hungary, virtually unknown abroad - it is well worth visiting this comprehensive exhibition of his works, collected from several museums and private collections. As often is the case, the explanations have numerous statements that are testament to the hubris of the curators, nothing else. The show is on until the end of December, so hurry."

WWII was not good for the castle. All its stained glass windows were destroyed along with much of the roof and all of the grand salons as well as most of the interior. As such the tour did not include the inside. From the photos it did not seem there was not much but paneling covering the interior walls. However the views of Budapest along with the history of the castle( provided by the tour guide) made the visit worthwhile."

It overlooks river Danube and Pest side. It looks impressive from any of the beautiful bridges of the metropolis but once you arrive under its walls, you start to comprehend its size. The walls are huge and tall, massive and strong. Walk around the building, walk in and out of its outer arches and plazas. It is a huge maze of buildings and side buildings, gates and roads. Impressive! Inside is even more impressive, the staircases, ceilings, gates and doors, etc. Amazing! It hosts exhibitions and museums, so to see everything, set aside many hours. Also, the castle offers magical views of the Hungarian imperial metropolis!"

The castle was pretty but some of the statues were a bit odd (a turkey vulture in front, a hunting scene in back). The iron gate in back had a raven.

This is the way to see Budapest. The battlements wind up and around through the cobble stone paths and we saw so many older folks walking uphill through the winding paths feeling sorry for themselves. We just wiz pass them on the bikes.Don't pay for a 2 way funicular ticket as you will walk to matthias church and probably walk down from there instead of walking back to the funicular as this walk will take you to the bridge near the Parliament which is on the other end of the castle and battlements."

However, it was a very pleasant climb up the hill on a gorgeous sunny day, and the views from the castle ramparts are spectacular, even with all the selfie photographers . Being there at 12 noon for the changing of the Palace Guard , with their very complicated ceremonial performance was a very fortunate opportunity. Certainly, a visit to the castle and the views it provides over Pest is a must see."

Currently, in the various rooms there are a series of tableaux, mainly depicting scenes from Verdi's The Masked Ball (accompanied by piped music of the opera). There is also a section (which I enjoyed but at which my wife demurred) where you walk for about thirty minutes in pitch dark, with only a cable fixed to the wall to guide you. There is also a considerable focus on the fifteenth-century Vlad the Impaler (aka Dracula) and references to his life, his marriage, and his (alleged) imprisonment in the Labyrinth. How much of this is historically accurate is highly debatable (and mostly unsupported by historical evidence). In addition, the Labyrinth has been subject to considerable conflict itself, with police raids in 2008 (allegedly for not having a tourist visa) and 2011 (for alleged environmental misdemeanours). During the latter, staff and tourists were forcibly removed by police (an account of which, written by the Labrynth's previous operators, can be found on the web). It would seem the attraction under their management had been altogether focused on more serious, reflexive issues, the role of labyrinth's in history, and on European cultural icons. As one reviewer noted, the present 'exhibition' is more 'cheesy.' I think I'd have preferred to visit in the former period. then, too, it had a restaurant!"

It was chocolate, so we did anyway, and enjoyed sweet and savoury treats from local suppliers while wandering around the courts and gardens of the castle. It was probably pretty close to what it might have been like in festival days of old. The Mathias fountain was pretty, the views impressive and the statuary interesting to behold.

To get there by public transport we took bus No.16 from Deak Ferenc Ter (accents missing) and got off once the bus crossed the bridge, right before the tunnel there is a bus stop. From there we walked up. I Have been told there is a bus that takes you directly up. Worth looking into if you are not a big fan of walking or have little time at your disposal. I assure that the view from the top will not disappoint."

As a someone who relishes the real deal rather than reproductions, it was sad to learn the earlier manifestation of this castle was destroyed in WWII. There have been so many battles in Budapest and this hill was usually a strategic location that it is no surprise that many old structures on it are lost. Still, there are some interesting parts of the building and a tomb underneath worth seeing."

As far as we understand, there aren't preserved/restored rooms as in other palaces/castles we have visited recently. There are various museums, however we did not visit them. There is construction going on in one section, so there isn't a great way to walk it in a loop. The castle provides many great photo opportunities, especially for sights on the Pest side, such as Parliament. The streets around are interesting to walk down and there are a number of monuments and points of interest."

We were in Budapest during 2015 Easter period and on the second day we planned to visit this after seeing Chain bridge and then zero point. We took Bus no 16 from the zero point, just crossing the chain bridge towards Buda side. However the bus originates from De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r near the yellow line metro station and going to Don\u00e1ti utca.There is a funicular service available from that point for going to top of the castle hill area, however that appeared too costly for us as the fare was 1400HUK for return where as the bus fare was 300HUK(as we took a block of 10 tickets)It took 15 mins to reach the top of the hill, stoppage named Dish Ter. This is one of the top choices in Castle hill area.  This area has a palace, beautiful entrance gates. This was built in 13-16 century. We heard that original castle was destroyed and replaced by a smaller one. Now this is the home for Hungarian National Gallery, History Museum and National library. We didn\u2019t go inside and enjoyed it from outside only. There are entry fee for all these Museums.There was a beautiful Easter market operated at that time in the Castle area, which also had an entry fee of 5 euro. However we went into the market and enjoyed some hot foods with local wines. Special mention was Chimney cake and honeycomb cake.We came back here again in the evening when it was dark. That was the time when we really enjoyed the place- it was almost deserted except some people with camera stand taking nice pictures of the Chain Bridge, Parliament and the Pest side. We also took lots of photos of beautiful illuminated snaps of Chain bridge with the reflection shimmering in the moonlight and went back at 9-30pm by bus no 216 tofrom De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r ."

However, it's an impressive set of buildings that were designated a World Heritage Site in 1987. With a history dating back to the mid-13th century, what is seen today is really a reflection of the improvements and modernisation implemented in the last 150 or so years. There are two entrances but most visitors will probably enter via the ornamental gate located near the funicular station. A statue of the turul, a mythical bird and the symbol of the Hungarian nation, stands perched at one end of the gate and is unmistakable. The grounds are decorated intermittently with fountains and statues. Look out for the Matthias fountain, the playful fountain entitled Fishing Children, as well as the grand equestrian statue of Prinz Eugen of Savoy that faces the Pest side of the city.The castle is more long than deep in its design but six of the interconnected buildings have been converted into the National Gallery, Budapest History Museum, and the National Library. However, like much of castle hill, the views from the castle's terraces are magnificent and picture postcard-like."

There's about 1km of naturally formed cave/tunnel that has been used at different times by the castle for storage, cellars, and at one point a prison (where Dracula was held!).

It had it all music, great traditional food, crowds of tourists enjoying the sun and ambience of this great Festival. As day turned to night, The Castle became alight with charm - I felt that someone was going to come out and tell me to 'go home' - that I shouldn't be in this beautiful place with a beer and a sausage. Good on them for allowing Festivals in the Castle grounds - those of us without these beautiful Castles in our homeland, are grateful to have an opportunity to visit."

It is certainly worth the visit, but it does not compare with Prague. Everything seems much younger, even Mattias Church, beautiful as it is, was only built around the turn of the twentieth century. At the South and quieter end is a poignant ruined church, with a poster display of the devastation caused by the battle for Budapest in 1945. Past the Matthias Church and approaching the enormous and visually impressive Royal Palace is a very large area of old building foundations (one of a church demolished in the eighteenth century) and a large area that looks something between a bomb site and an abandoned archaeological dig - at the moment it does not add anything to the overall impression of the area."

There are also a couple of coffee shops and restaurants although I didn't visit them so cannot comment. Definitely worth a visit on a trip to Buda."

When visiting the Castle District do your homework as one building after the other has special significance and if you are unprepared or without a tourist guide, you quickly loose track of priorities and significance of different building as they are cluttred together in the walled area. I suggest you enter the walled area from the Funicular and make the Castle your first stop. If you enter from opposite side, you are dead tired by the time you reach the Castle. Too much to see, so best to come prepared and do some homework."

            "review": "Stately old lady.. If you really would like to see the grandeur of Buda Castle, first have look from Pest side of the city, across the Duna (Danube) River. The Castle is proudly perching on the top of a hill.The construction of Buda Castle began in 1243. During the more than 770 years of its existence, it has repeatedly besieged, captured, recaptured, damaged, and then has been restored.During the Second World War major part the Royal Palace and Castle District was destroyed. In the 1960s they were rebuilt and restored to their current condition. This is what we can marvel at now.You have several possibilities to get there. Walking is one of them. If you prefer some kind of transport, catch the No 16, 16A, or 116 buses, and I would advise to get off at B\u00e9csi kapu square and stroll through the Castle District .It you want to get closer to the castle , stay on the bus till D\u00edsz square. Currently it is a bit difficult to find the bus stop what originally was at Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n square, but now I would rather call this part already Sz\u00e9na square. There is the bus stop at the front of the Burger King, at the corner where Ostrom Street turns into Sz\u00e9na square. These problems are temporary extended because of the rebuilding of Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n square.Since the 22nd of May the above promenade accessible from to different places. From near B\u00e9csi kapu, you can get up to Anjou promenade and from the Szenth\u00e1roms\u00e1g street line onto T\u00f3th \u00c1rp\u00e1d promenade by elevator. The third new elevator operates on the other side. From under the Hilton hotel it goes to Iskola Street. All the three elevators are carrying wheelchairs. Of course first you still have to get somehow to the base of the Castle walls.The forth is an express lift. You have to go to D\u00f3zsa Gy\u00f6rgy square and from there to Palota Street. The lift starts from there and takes you up to the Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi National Library, what is part of the Buda Castle. There is a fee, 200.- HUF one way (less than USD 1.-), while the previous three are free of charges.Now, when you\u2019re finally there, look around and enjoy the inimitable atmosphere of the castle. There is usually some kind of event, if you want some other entertainments as well.The Royal Castle contains the above mentioned Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi National Library, the Hungarian National Gallery, the Budapest History Museum, etc. There are plenty of things to see, so you can spend the whole day there easily.On the 5th of July a Csontv\u00e1ry exhibition will open, and it can be visited till the 31st of December. For me it is a must see thing, since Csontv\u00e1ry one of my favourite painters.Next to the Castle is the S\u00e1ndor Palace, where the current President of Hungary always resides ,and where the Castle Hill Funicular arrives from the Buda bridgehead of Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Chain Bridge. So this is another way to get up there. The funicular cost HUF 1200.- for one way, and HUF 1800.- for return.If you still looking for some entertainments go to the Castle Theatre, where the National Dance Theatre performs now.You can also try your skills in archery, or crossbow, or spear and shuriken throws. It depends what you prefer. Or just stroll around, and admire the many sculptures, the colourful flowerbeds, have a coffee, or a lunch, or buy a traditional Transylvanian funnel cake (what is not only good, but fun to eat as well), look at the wonderful panoramic view of the Duna River, the bridges, the Parliament House and the St Stephan Basilica from the walls of the Castle, the choices are endless.The Buda Castle will provide you with a nice experience and wonderful memories later on."

The area is also home to lovely museums ! Castle Hill, a World Heritage Site, showcases wonderful Gothic arches, very old Baroque houses, cobblestone streets along with lovely cafes and souvenir shops.Some houses were built in the 14th and 15th century AD. I took a taxi to reach the Hill but the entire sightseeing was done on foot and that meant a great deal of walking around and it is absolutely a delight to walk around in the Castle hill area. It goes without saying that if you are visiting Budapest then visiting Buda castle and spending time at the castle hill is a must !"

I spent an hour rushing around the outside, and still didn't get it all. Inside is a museum largely devoted to the Habsburg rule of Budapest & Hungary, will leave to others to comment. Not only is the building amazingly beautiful with a huge archway entrance but their are numerous sculptures on the tops of the building to view and plenty Habsburg heraldric shields of varying types - both personal & family ones. As you walk in there is Matthias's fountain, built in the 1600's that is a momument in itself. I stupidly allowed only one day for the Buda Castle/Hill complex - DON'T make the same mistake. You need 2 days at least, 3 if you actually know and appreciate the history.A must see.NB most attractions in this part of the world are closed Mondays. Take into account."

However, it's highly recommended if just for the museum, which is a valuable introduction into the artistic and cultural heritage of Hungary. You can also go into the dome to get an expansive view of Buda and Pest bisected by the serpentine majesty of the Danube. Tip: if you want to take photos within the museum, then you MUST buy a \"photo ticket\" at the ticket counter. You will be stopped and ASKED for this ticket if you are seen photographing in the museum. If you are CAUGHT without a ticket, then adopt a \"I'm so sorry I didn't know about such a thing and will quickly rectify my mistake\" attitude. Where some museums might ban photography (or allow it for free), the museum has adopted the grubbing capitalist approach presumably after shedding the collectivist coils of its post-Communist hangover."

It's completely rebuilt so it resembles the original castle. The facade of the Castle is not the original stone due to the cost. The tour inside is not worth taking but definitely go for the views of the Danube River, the Chain Bridge, Parliament and much of Pest. Over by Fishermans Bastion the views of the River are somewhat obstructed by trees but the view at the castle is completely open, no trees interfering with your pictures. If your there around noon or 3 in the afternoon there's a neat ceremony for the changing of the guard. Go there for the great photos you can take outside."

There is a army drill that happens every 15-20 min which is great fun for the kids to watch. They commence with an authentic drum roll which then leads to a little March ceremony. My children aged 7 & 10 throughly enjoyed this. The castle is stunning. Very different from the usual Parisian or English castle architecture. Very enjoyable indeed. Just a tip- Budapest was considerably cheaper than Paris so we took the hop on hop off bus tour and throughly enjoyed the visits. I would recommend eating at the many outlets at the castle considering they are not that pricey. Many people opted not to go inside the castle, which is fine too as the exterior is beautiful. The surrounding views of Budapest are worth a million. We throughly enjoyed it! "

The week we were in Budapest the funicular up the castle slope was under major repair so we had to walk (although the ubiquitous hop-on hop-off bus tours naturally find their way to the top too). In my view the castle and the adjacent buildings look better from afar ie from across the river than close up. However, there are the museums and the gallery to explore and several walkways that offer great views back to Pest and the Danube. The adjacent Sandor Palace is the Office of the President of the Republic of Hungary and I believe there is a guard changing display regularly ?? on the hour with a band on certain days."

Buda Castle, a \"must see attarction\" to visit during any Budapest visit, is a continuation of the Fisherman Bastion which is only 7-10 minutes walking. To the Bastion it is only two bus stops (Bus 16) )from near the Parliament.A very good point to have a panoramic picture of the City. You should take your time, never rush and try to enjoy your viewings. On the way back from the Castle a good alternative might be to take a river tram and go in any direction - it is just 5 minutes walking down the steps to the river tram stop, you can easily see it when enjoying magnificent views. When combining Fisherman Bastion with Buda Castle and river tram you have perfect combination of watching the city from the hills and then from within the river - you also see both sides of embankment and details of all the bridges and Parliament bulding. You can stop and visit Shoes on Danube on the way and proceed to Margit Island if the weather allows. Strongly recommended to buy day tickets (I bought 72 hours right in the airport - you just say from which time you want it activated) and it was definetely worth it as you are very mobile, transport system excelent and tram trips are also covered by these tickets. Also would recommend downloading Trip Avisor's BUDAPEST which is a valuable things as it allows you planning or changing your itinerary, gives all the details of public transportaion and schedules."

This castle has gone under various titles, THE ROYAL PALACE, ROYAL CASTLE, but now everyone knows it as BUDA CASTLE. Viewed in daytime ,unbelievably beautiful, if your lucky enough to catch the ceremony of the changing of the guard your in for a treat. Viewed at night the illuminated castle is breathtaking. Very easy to get to,bus 16 brings you to the castle as does the VARBUSZ from MOSZKVA TER. You can also get the FUNICULAR TRAIN up the hill but in my opinion unless you want to ride this train as something that was on your tick list of things to do in this wonderful city, i would stick with public transport. The views from the castle are magnificent, you can see CHAIN BRIDGE and the DANUBE in all their glory,so a trip up here is well worth a couple of hour's out of your day."

The first part of this place was a little odd. Here you have a former prison and for some reason the early areas of the labyrinth are devoted to mannequins dressed in opera costumes and wigs with opera music playing. Bit strange as it doesn't really match the surroundings. Anyway, it gets better with lots of creepy areas and information about Dracula. This is a fairly large attraction and you may feel that you'll never get out, but you will. Worth a visit especially if you want to feel a dark oppressive atmosphere. I think it should focus more on horror and torture and fear and less on Opera, it could be a very frighting experience. One area of the labyrinth is devoted to being in total darkness and finding your way through a short corridor in absolute darkness, as somebody who sometimes goes caving I am used to this and is very enjoyable to be immersed in total darkness and relying on your other senses (for a short time), but this part of the labyrinth was ruined by people using the torches on their mobile phones. Why enter the dark chamber if your going to use a torch? It's not a compulsory area to visit. If your afraid of the dark, don't go in that bit, you'll only ruin it for others! Maybe it needs a member of staff in there to enforce the darkness?"

In 1764 Austrian- Hungarian Empress Maria Theresa donated money for the completion of the building. But she did not want to live there, so some nuns moved in. But they found it unsuitable, so the University moved in. But again they also found it not to their liking so the local Austrian 'Viceroy' shifted in because Hungary was of course part of the Habsburg Empire. Then like most castles, palaces and cathedrals the wax candles cause the building to burn down.In 1856 good old Franz-Joseph caused it to be rebuilt, just finishing in 1912 ready for the First World War!!In 1944 the now German-Austrian army moved in, causing the Russians to blast them out; leaving very little left of Buda Castle - plus scores of Hungarian soldiers dead in the streets. And that was the end of the Habsburg Rule when King Charles the Sixth abdicated.IN 1966 rebuilding recommenced and still continues today. However, they started to build a 500 space underground car-park, but the last I heard it was unfinished.So much for a bit of the building's history. Check out the other TripAdvisor comments on their visit. I think you will find they are mostly very positive.Brian, from Perth. W. Australia."

We went to the castle having toured around Europe already for a while, this castle is really unlike any other, walking around all the different areas and even getting hot wine and pretzels in the courtyard was very nice! There was a free walking tour that we were able to hear a few tidbits about the castle so that was also cool! We chose to take the trolly up and then find ourselves walking down the other side! So worth it, worth the view and the experience, you can also spend as little or as much time as you want up here as it is not so busy and crowded that you fell pushed through. Best of all to walk along the castle is free! There are parts that cost but we did not do them this time! We had a great enough time without the museum!"

From the stand-offish outer walls to the quaint farmstyle courtyard, this place had it all! The main building houses a museum, which isn't the best in all honesty - more picture than anything else but cheap enough to be worth a look anyway. There is a cafe as you enter the museum, which was reasonably priced as ever in Budapest. At the back of the museum there was a set up offering the opportunity to try medieval weapons - spears etc. Great fun, and cheap as ever!"

It's part of the Buda Castle complex, so go there and find one of those maps sticking out of the ground and search for \"Labyrinth.\" It's towards the Fisherman's Bastion, in that general direction, on the left. There is a small sign hanging from one of the buildings.Anyhow, you go down some steep steps and buy a ticket. I found it really creepy and I was jumpy the whole time but it was amazing! :)There are random opera scenes with explanations printed next to them. Some torture chambers, tombs, graves, heads on spikes, hooded figures in the dark, etc.I was afraid the whole time that someone might jump out and scare us (as part of the tour) but this never happened - thank God!There is are differents sections of the Labyrinth that play different music and that look different. Some are covered in heavy fog and \"monk\" music while others have no music and are in complete dark.Speaking of which, there is a section which has no lighting and there is a rope on the wall that you use as a guideline. You hold the rope and follow it through the passage. Rule - no lights. :) Go with someone, it's super fun and really scary as the sounds from other parts of the labyrinth bounce around. There are water droplets that add to the spooky atmosphere as well.The air can get heavy at times because of the smoke machine and the high humidity, so be prepared. You will not suffocate but it's no spring breeze either. :)Tip - if you arrive around sunset they will turn off most of the lights and give you an oil lantern to find your way around. Lanterns can be found at the CASA (ticket booth where you bought the tickets). We went in March and around 17:30 they turned off the lights.This attraction is for everyone looking for some adventure tourism, kids are welcome too. They even organize birthday parties! :)"

One would usually visit the castle for the stunning view over the city, but it isn't functioning as a castle any more: there is the great Hungarian (historic) art gallery in the building. Well, if you are a foreign tourist you might not know anything about Hungarian arts. I never thought to enter there with foreigners, because I thought that it would be boring for them. Then two Italian friends of mine -one an art student from Torino University and an other one an IT professional took it as basic that we have to see the exhibition -they visited on separate occasions. Both times I could hardly drag them out of the place after hours of wandering around in the building. Hungarian artists have historically had strong bonds and connections with Italians so I guess it's easy for them to relate to everything on show there and the gallery managers really have collected the best pieces of art from the history of Hungary. Entrance fee is 1400 huf (5 Euros) for an adult. So, I would recommend the gallery for everyone coming from Europe and having some interest in arts. If you are the standard \"art equals Mona Lisa\" type of person and you couldn't care less for the so called \"hidden treasures\", then just enjoy the view! It's free and beautiful."

It is at the top of a very steep hill but the pathway from the end of Chain Bridge climbs gently and is suitable for most to use. However, there is also access via the funicular railway (although the queues for this were very long when we visited). Once at the top of the hill, the views over Budapest are nothing short of spectacular and there is so much to see in the area that a day is very easy to fill. The Old Town & Castle Hill are so full of history and interest (taking a good travel guide with you is highly recommended) that it is hard to know where to start but it certainly doesn't disappoint. If you get hungry during the day, I recommend that you head for the Cafe Miro in the Old Town near to the Matyas Church - cheap and fantastic local food in a relaxed and interesting 'arty' cafe. This area is nothing short of spectacular and should definitely be at the top of your Budapest sightseeing list."

The exterior whilst looking authentic from afar is in fact moulded concrete and the interior has not been restored at all and looks like the inside of a shopping centre car park. The statues outside however are beautiful, especially the hunting scene to the rear of the castle- our guide advised us that this was because they were dismantled and buried during the war. They have also just started excavating the old foundations of the original castle which stood there, however work has stopped due to Europe's poor economy- it will be very exciting to see what is uncovered of the castle's Imperial past mixed with it's more modern troubled history!"

I'm not a big fan of art so I sped through that museum in about 1.5 hours but the average person could spend 3 hours inside that alone. Cost for the art museum is 1400 Hungarian for the permanent exhibit or 2400 for that plus the artist (usually famous) exhibited at that time. Beware you pay 500 Hungarian to be able to take pics"

The castle dominates the Buda side of the Danube, spectacular at night when lit up and viewed from the river, from one of the bridges or from the Pest side.BUT, at rhe moment, there is contruction in progress limiting the number of restrooms available to the general public.Access can be via the funicular at the Clark Adams square next to the Chain Bridge or a Hop-On-Hop-Off tour bus, which is a great way to orient yourself in Budapest, or any city on your first day."

Though there is a funicular to go up and down, if you have the time I would recommend a leisurely walk through the chain bridge. The view from the top is spectacular and you can keep clicking away till the batteries run out ! I could not see any interiors as I was a late visitor in the evening. There are plenty of visitors and both the walk up to the palace and the return is exhilarating."

It is a great view waking across the bridge, great for taking photos. Take the funicular lift up the mountain, it will save your legs and is a quirky way up. The castle grounds are stunning and the architecture is fabulous. There is souvenir stalls up there as well as food stalls and a cafe. As I went in summer it was very hot so you will need water and sunscreen. You can drive up there and take a bus but I recommend walking from the other side of the river and getting the funicular."

I had read about it online and it seems to be a little hidden gem as when we asked for directions from our Hotel Reception and also at one of the help desks in the Castle area no one seemed to know about the Labyrinth by Lantern Night Tour but it did exist. There were mini cards that you can pick up in the Tourist Information Centre and by doing this my partner and I got 200HUF each off the attraction which was 2000HUF each. It was worth the money and one of the best attractions. Although, it was very scary by Lanterns. We went at 18.00 thinking it would be a group of people with a tour guide and lanterns. We got there around 5.45 and seemed to be the only ones there and he told us to take a lantern and go through as you do it on your own. All the lights are turned off in the Labyrinth and you are on your own which is very scary. If I had known about that in advance I might have done it in the day when it wasn't as scary. We were in there for about 15 minutes before we saw other people going through which was a relief then I felt more courageous to go back to certain parts we had missed before by tagging on behind to other people! Very scary by Lantern and worth a visit. I was scared I might get lost in there and get locked in overnight but on exiting I could see we had been on CCTV so if I had known that before I entered I might have been a bit braver when in there! Well worth the money but do it at night when all the lights are off and they have opera music playing which adds to the thrill factor."

It is easy to see why the Castle, and the Citadell, were built on this side of the river as I'm sure those inhabiting them enjoyed looking down on the poorer people below!! A very nice castle with nice relaxing grounds to stroll around and a few market stalls to to help you spend your Forint!! The castle was home to an art exhibition while we were there but other than that I am not sure how much of the inside of the castle is open to the public. Another must see."

The tunnels are well lit to give of an Erie feel. You guide yourself round by use of arrows on the walls. There is one section that I loved, it was completely dark and you guided yourself round by use of ropes on the wall. You don't have to do that section but it is worth it. You eventually descend into what is supposed to be draculas resting place, it's lit really well like the rest of the tour. There are some odd opera displays and a small strange cinema to look at to.

In my opinion, the best way to proceed, will depend much on your own taste. In my case, I love history, so I decided myself for a guided tour (I have also writen a review about it). First of all, is quite easy to get up to the castle. The bus 16 leaves from Deak Ter, nearby Vaci utca, and it brings you all the way up to the Castle.You can also take the funicular from the square in front of the Szecheny bridge. Also the bus nr. 16 stops there. Once up, the funicular will stop in front of St. Mathias Basilica. Also the bus nr. 16 has different stops around the Castle neighborhood (more like a small village).I will recommend also on this review, to buy the Budapest Card. It costs around 8500 HUF, depending if you buy it on the net (cheaper), or on a sale point (you will also fin done at Deak Ter, at the start of Vaci utca). With this Budapest Card, you have 2 free guided tours, free entrance to 8 Museus (we did not visit all of them, free entrance to Lucazs Baths and ilimited use of public transport).Up at the Buda Castle, you will be able to walk around and have stunning views of the city. If you are not taking a guided tour, I really recommend to og a bit late in the afternoon, so it will not be so warm as it is almost impossible to find a shadow. To take a walk around the village is interesting and you will also find the Fisherman\u2019s Bastion just getting out of the funicular.Everything depends on how many days you are visiting the city. This time, we spend four and a half days and we had time to visit everything which would be considered as a must.*If you have with you the Budapest Card when you visit Castle neighborhood, you can also enter to the Hungarian National Gallery (Only the permanent exposition, the seasonal are paid a part) and the Budapest History Museum. Remember, in Hungary, all museums are closed on Mondays. So a visit to the Buda Castle, could really keep you busy for a few hours if you have a complete overview of the area."

The terrace in front of the castle overlooks the Danube and Pest, including an area that juts out further and provides a great view of Margaret Island as well. The fountain with Matthias in his hunting attire and with his dogs, advisor and mistress is quite unique. Be sure to take the time to see this part of Castle Hill when you are there."

All transport cheap efficient and generally you will always find someone who speaks English to ask incase you are unsure, friendly locals.

It is one of the most important historical attractions in the city and can be easily found perched atop Castle Hill on the Buda side of the Danube River. This is the site of of castles and palaces which have served as the seat of power over the region since at least the 13th century. King B\u00e9la IV built a medieval castle here between 1247 and 1265. By the end of the 15th century, King Matthias had made it into a large-scale and lavishing building, which was then overrun by the Turks during the occupation period. Destroyed during the liberation of Budapest in 1686, a Baroque style palace was erected in the early 18th century as Hungary fell under Hapsburg rule. Under the direction of Empress Maria Theresa the Palace was vastly expanded and experienced a glorious period which lasted until WWII, when it was more or less destroyed. Today the Royal Palace is as it was after reconstructions shortly after the war. Within Buda Castle you can visit the very good Hungarian National Gallery, which showcases historic artworks by Hungarian artists. There is also the Budapest History Museum, found within the Royal Palace grounds, which contains many artefacts from the city and castle. The castle exterior is architecturally attractive, as are the fountains and equestrian statue of Prince Eugene of Savoy found directly in front of the entrance to the Hungarian National Gallery. However, most impressive and memorable are the fantastic panorama views of the city below Buda Castle. This is probably what we enjoyed most about our visit to the the castle."

Currently under re-construction, but other than some very large and imposing buildings, there is not much to do here. The Art Museum is in part of the huge building, but you cannot get into any of the rest of the structures. On our tour of Budapest the guide said that the Communists gutted the ornate interiors and whitewashed all the rooms!! Too bad, perhaps it will be better once they finish re-construction."

When in Budapest, one of my top picks is seeing the Changing of the Guard at the presidential residence, which is in the Buda Castle, (right next to the Castle Hill Funicular). The guards change every hour, (and they have the last changing of the guard at 4:30pm, when the last guards go off duty). The best show happens at noon. The changing takes approximately five minutes, (the guards complete multiple precision drills with their rifles and march around the presidential residence). A camera and video recorder are recommended. The other changing of the guards are impressive, but the best and longest is at noon. Afterwards, there are many buildings to view and you can see the old foundations that they are unearthing that are several centuries old. There are also some gift shops that sell great souvenirs. If you want extra enjoyment take the Castle Hill Funicular from the castle for about $7.50 (round-trip)."

The interior of the castle is an art museum, with white washed walls. No, it's not the Hermitage, or Peterhof, but there is one of the best collections of carved wooden alter pices I have ever seen. Buy a ticket, walk left of the ticket counter and enter, and there are some steps up to the second floor. You won't be sorry. There is a good coection of Hungarian impressionist artists. I am always impressed at the quality, though they are not Renoir. Which reminds me, they have awesome exibits that are on disply. This year van Gogh, Renoir, Matisse, show going on. I have never seen any of these artists paintings before, but now I see why people rave about them, and I'm not an art fanatic. Sandor Palace is next door, at 12:00 they have a changing of the guard, nice to catch. Then head to Matthias Church taht was just renovated and is awesome. many other sights to see in the Buda are, a whole day. Some people say the castle is a waste of time. Try Yellowstone next year."

It is quite a large area so make sure you wear sensible shoes. There are many sculptures and fountains, buildings and breathtaking views of Budapest. Another essential item is of course your camera, there are myriad photo opportunities to make you look like a pro.I have captured a lot of this castle area in 3D which you can see on my iPad app 3D City Explorer. My favourite part of the castle is that it sits high above the rest of the old city and you can really get a feel for what it must have been like in the old days when there were Kings and Queens. You couldn't get a better location to build a castle here, and Hungary is a fascinating place. In summer there are free concerts within the castle open court area, and a nearby walk to the Fisherman's Bastion will take you to restaurants and cafes, with more amazing views. You can easily spend a beautiful day out up here.Regards, Ken.3dcityexplorer.com"

We paid to get the lift up to the top and back because it was just quicker! You can walk up there if you dont want to pay for the lift. Once we got up there, there was a wine festival going on, so we paid to go in there too and it was a great experience! Lots of wine, cheese and food and live music. It really was a great atmostphere and great experience. The view of budapest from up in the castle was a beautiful sight, and was even prettier at night! Got abit chilly though!"

The best view of the Chain Bridge can be seen once you reach the top of the hill. It's a nice leisurely walk through the castle grounds with plenty of places to sit and relax. The smell of the food coming from the vendors near the castle was very inviting. They were setting up for a food & wine festival that day so we didn't get to stay around that area for too long. We didn't have enough time to go inside the castle since we were only in Budapest for the day. Wish we could have stayed longer.

I am into art, so I paid to go into the palace which is a lovely building although has very little left from yesteryear. The Baroque and pre-baroque art is excellent. Although I am into modern art, I didn't rate anything in their collection from that era. Except maybe the giant painting called something along the lines of Pilgrimage to the Cedars in Lebanon... Most of the art is religious but well executed. The red marble staircase is pretty cool and has some fossils in the stone. (Red marble is a Hungarian thing). Was crowded outside, but not inside. Probably because tickets are at least 1000HUF for an adult. (Can't remember exact price)"

So having someone knowledgable about its history would be so much better to go with you. We went by \"Hop On Hop Off \" bus that has recorded tours that are informational in all languages BUT the go by fast. So I we'd suggest you go on the round trip once (2 hrs) ,determine where u want to get off the next time around, do some research on a guide and then go around again.

I got the impression that visitors stay mainly on the Pest side, where there is lots to see, and spend probably a day on the Buda side as it appears to be more suburban/residential, and it's hillier too, so not that easy to tramp around unless you enjoy hiking up and down hills.However, if you are spending time in Budapest you do need to visit both sides of the river, and a day for Buda should be enough. We did not go into any of the buildings, some are not accessible anyway as they are offices, and some are being renovated, but we enjoyed walking around (there's a walk up unless you use some form of transport) and looking at the various attractions as we meandered around. There are plenty of places to eat, and there are stalls with food and drink and souvenirs, so you won't go hungry or get bored.Great views of Pest and the river from this side as well."

Bu the view it's great, the pictures will be beautiful. Take your time, walk arround and then go in the center, grab something to eat (after you exist the grounds of the castle, you will walk along a bridge with many flags and you will enter the city, at a crossroud there you can find a restaurant where you can serve yourself and pay at the cashere up front, they are not very cheap but the food it's amazing).

Once inside, the girls behind us quickly ran into the stalls, cutting the line very aggressively. We didn't feel comfortable \"competing\" with young girls, having no past experiences of bullying the young, so we let a few of them go first.

The palace is no longer a palace but a complex of museums. There is a library, an art museum and some history museums. The art museum was nice. It featured mostly Hungarian artists so that was interesting as they are not usually well-known. As it was a hot day and there is no air conditioning, the building was warm so we opted not to see any more museums."

To get there very easily, take the Budvari Siklo [Buda Hill Funicular] near the Chain Bridge. The large, imposing building at the top is known as the Royal Palace, and is the home for a number of important Hungarian cultural institutions. You\u2019ll find the Budapest History Museum here, which covers the history of Budapest. The National Art Gallery is also here, as is the National Library of Hungary, the National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library. At the top of the funicular ride, and separated from the Royal Palace, is the President\u2019s House. Just as in London, England, have your picture taken with the soldiers stationed at the guard houses!Castle Hill is a Unesco World Heritage Site, and it is an impressive sight from the shores of Pest, towering over the cliffs on the Buda side. However, don\u2019t expect the over-the-top glitter and glitz at this World Heritage site that you would expect at other palaces or castle in Europe. The reconstruction of the building after WWII was more for symbolic reasons, as no monarch had lived in the palace or on the grounds since 1541. However, the halls of the Ballroom, St. Sigismund\u2019s Chapel, the Palatinal Crypt, the Great Ballroom, the Main Staircase, and the Habsburg Room are all still elegant examples of refined architecture. The palace building consists of a several wings (lettered A to F), which are situated around the Lion Courtyard. There are sculptures located throughout the grounds and on the buildings, there are beautiful fountains to see, and there is a phenomenal view of the Danube and of Pest. The flower gardens are also very lovely in the warmer months. When you get off of the Siklo and walk along the Danube overlook, check out the bronze statue of a large bird that is perched on top of a tall pedestal. This is the mythical Turul bird, a powerful symbol of the Kingdom of Hungary. After touring around the Royal Palace museums, stroll towards St. Matthias Church and the Castle District, and check out the craft stalls along the way. Some reasonably-priced fridge magnets and small souvenirs can be found there. Be sure to look carefully at the fantastic buildings along the way to the church\u2026the famous POSTA building is a mellow yellow color, another has a famous ceramic statue created by the beloved artist Margit Kov\u00e1cs perched in an alcove above the first floor, and other buildings are painted in bright colors.Put aside at least a whole day, if not more, for exploring Buda Castle, the Castle District, St. Matthias Church, the Fisherman\u2019s Bastion and other famous sites. There are many museum, gardens, shops, and churches to see and discover."

Disappointed with the museum. Equivelent to \u00a38 each admission and frankly although large not worth the cost."

When we visited it had snowed, but it's really nice to walk thereInside the castle grounds there is also an interesting and huge National Galery Museum when you want to escape from the freezing cold during winter if you feel so.Beautifully lit at night till around midnight, it's the evening sight when you are on the other side of the river.Make sure you don't miss this one, even if your stay is short."

Good value for money, really considering the place is massive. The will also store your coat for free, giving you a keyfob with a number on it so you can redeem your coat after your visit.

Tourist prices but you can stop for a nice coffee and cake (Cafe Pierot does a great hot chocolate)From Fishermans Bastian you get some more great views of the city.We walked down from there and it is about 5mins to the river.You can walk along and take picture postcard photos of parliament from there (again, at night with the reflection on the water is is amazing!)We didn't do the labyrinths as they seemed a bit touristy and overpriced but you could easily spend half a day up there.Visit the Hungarian house of wines as well for wine tasting."

Buda Royal CastleThe huge building on the south end of the hill fortress was a royal palace, with different styles and looks in the historical period, starting from the XIV. century. Rebuilt 400 years later, while the largest reconstruction works be carried out after the Second World War. In the day and age there are Historical Museum of Budapest, the Hungarian National Gallery and the National Sz\u00e9chenyi Library (Sz\u00e9chenyi K\u00f6nyvt\u00e1r).Buda is perfect \"antidote\" to speed through the crowd and Pest. Hilly Buda can be seen as sigh of fresh air, especially during the hot summer months. Take advantage of the time to get you to admire the luxurious residential villas, walk trails, rent a bike and take in the view that you can enjoy, explore caves stalagmites or just enjoy your meal in a restaurant surrounded by green nature"

Whilst in Budapest we had the good fortune to visit the Buda Castle Area which is very interesting and not at all what I expected. Budapest was a very pleasant surprise and this area if you ever visit is a must not miss experience. On our travel we found a quaint little Gift Shop called Yulla Creatives in an area know locally as Fortuna Passage and they were selling genuine hand crafted Hungarian Ceramic products that were not only beautifully hand painted but of a very high quality. Some of the Christmas decorations were exceptional and it made me feel very sad that Australians are so limited to cheap overseas reproductions when for the same money and in many cases less it was possible to buy absolutely beautiful items originally made and handcrafted. Why do we accept rubbish over quality ? The gentleman who runs this shop is called \"Marko\" and he is funny , witty and entertaining and if you actually bother to spend time in his shop you will find he knows an awful about the area as well. There is also an exceptional restaurant and bookstore adjacent to the Gift Shop. Just beware the area does have cobblestones so come well prepared with good walking shoes. The views from this area are spectacular and musicians play instruments I have never seen before (a piano like instrument played with sticks ) so it certainly opens up your senses and broadens the mind about what exists on the other side of the world. For all the Australians contemplating a river cruise from Amsterdam to Budapest or vice versa make sure you visit this area and be sure to drop in and see \"Marko\" and don't just walk in and walk out - that's very rude and a bit ignorant - have a chat to him and ask questions about his products and the area in general and I will be astonished if you do not walk out with at least one item. I rate this part of our trip right at the top and we brought back some beautiful hand painted plates and a couple of Christmas Tree decorations and in all our travels we have seen nothing else like it.Anyway Budapest is special. If you can also get to see their Parliament - its truly magnificent."

That said if you're interested you should take a wonder through the gardens to checkout the fountains, as well as the museum inside. TIP: If you're interested in attending, approach the castle from infamous cable bridge. You then have the choice of either the Funicular up the hill or walking. If you approach from the other side (the korut street side) of the castle there is also a lift, however this costs 100 ft each."

The Hungarian National Gallery which was virtually empty, probably because of the appalling lack of signage outside, contained some incredible wooden sculptures. However many galleries were closed off, leaving a feeling of disappointment. An overload of fairly ordinary Madonna and Christ paintings did not help to lessen the disappointment.  The labyrinth of Buda Castle provided a rewarding experience. Many exhibits depicting life from thousands of years ago displayed throughout a mass of rock embraced caves. l visited on a day when the outside temperature was high and the coolness was appreciated almost as much as the contents of the caves! The Funicular railway connecting the Castle area to the Buda end of the Chain Bridge, is a pleasant way to access or leave the area. Castle Hill is probably one of the best points from which to observe this fine Capital City, without charge."

It might be better to call the Buda Castle the Castle Grounds because it's really a whole complex including walls, grounds, fountains, and, of course, buildings, instead of being a medieval-style castle which many people envision when the term \"castle\" is used. The Castle has been damaged many times in history, with the most recent damage being inflicted by the Soviets in WWII. Because of this it has been rebuilt many times in different styles. Most of the buildings have been devoted to museums, such as the Hungarian National Gallery, which houses some of Hungary's most famous and important artifacts and works of art. Sitting on the Northwest side of the Danube on a hill, the Castle affords outstanding views of Pest across the river, as well as the lower part of Buda. The breezes blowing off the river are refreshing, and as a result of the elevation and the river breezes this area is often cooler than the rest of the city in the hot summer months. My favorite part of the Castle grounds is the Matyas Fountain, depicting King Matyas and his men with their hunting dogs. The figures are so lifelike I can almost imagine the dogs are panting. Visitors to Budapest should not miss the Castle as it is one of the most important historic sites in Budapest."

The building is an impressive one, with an extraordinary panorama of the whole city. We liked the most the National Gallery which has an impressive collection of paintings from the 17th and 18th century. Visiting the Royal Palace is a must do for every traveller in Budapest."

Fisherman's Bastion looks like a sandcastle, and was fun to wander around. I thought the price for St. Matthais was a bit steep when you could see so many of the other beautiful churches for free, so we didn't go in. Plus, my daughter was sick of churches. The only museum we had time for was the Budapest History Museum. We went because it was free with our Budapest Card. It was OK. Just so you know, the labyrinth under the castle hill is closed. You can walk up the hill, but it looks like quite a trek. The funicular wasn't included in our travel pass (and it didn't actually look like it was running when we were there. I never saw it move, anyway), but there's a bus that will take you to just down from St. Matthais, which will save you from being tired before you even start looking around. The walk down from the castle was very nice, though, and the path came down just at the end of the chain bridge, which makes it very easy to just walk back across to the rest of town."

There were lots of things to see and do: you can visit the museums, just walk around the castle grounds and admire the fountains, the garden and the beautiful city beneath, or you could venture into the Castle District with its quaint little buildings and shops and walk your way to the enchanting and intricately design Fisherman's Bastion."

Our hotel was overlooking the Chain Bridge and we had a great view of the Royal Palace from our bedroom window.There are many ways to get to the Royal Palace and we opted to walk across the Chain Bridge and catch the travelator ( a hundred year old carriage going up a steep incline) up the hill. Once at the top we were instantly in the grounds of the Palace. You need to spend at least a day here maybe more as there is so much to see besides the Palace. My favourite was the WWII bunker set into the citadel which also had fantastic views. We were told that the Royal Palace was flattened during WWII if this is the case they have done a fantastic restoration job because it looks authentic. Take a tour inside the Palace it is well worth seeing also."

The buda castle is a wonderfull place to walk through and the sight from the castle toward the danube is lovely specially in the evening when the sun goes down and the lights come up on the bridges. One may go up with the Siklo , but there is also an easy to climb, trail (about 120 steps) from Adam clark square up to the castle. A lazy walk from south end of the castle to the north end would take arround an hour. We walked the whole thing both ways and stopped at all the sights , and it took us about two hours. The Labyrinth is also worth a visit. Entrance fee is reasonable (2000 forint each) and it is cool inside and unique ,we spent arround an hour getting lost inside."

The Hungarian history and art museums are located here as well. To get there, you can take the funnicular or walk up. If it is at the end of a long day of walking, you may want to spend more for the funnicular (around 800 forints 1 way or about 1400 round trip). I especially don't think it is worth it to pay extra for a return trip since it's a pleasant walk down."
