We booked the full day Cape tour and started our journey with 7 others on the half day tour, Nabeel was friendly and informative about everywhere we went. We got the opportunity to stop at numerous places to explore and take photos with Nabeel always keeping a watchful eye on us. We took some slight detours so we could view antelope in the wild and dip our feet in the sea!We left the rest of the group at Boulders beach and we're lucky enough to have the tour bus to ourselves, we went for lunch followed by wine tasting.Shortly after leaving the wine tasting we were stopped at a police road check, the police man was very rude to him for no reason and I thought this was very unfair to Nabeel. He was nothing but polite to the policeman. All in all we had a great day out we learnt lots about the region. I would highly reccomend the tours especially with Nabeel :)"

We were met at the airport upon arrival from Australia and transported to our hotel.Our driver was well presented and the car was spotless.On our second day we joined a small tour group for a half day \"City and Table Mountain\" tour which was well organised and ran smoothly. The next day we did a full day tour to \"Cape Point and the Peninsular\" This showed us a wide range of breath- taking scenery showing a wide contrast of rugged conditions, broad sandy beaches and Kirstenbosch Gardens.Another highlight was visiting Boulder Beach and seeing the Penguins - something quite special. We were picked up at our hotel on our last day and taken to the airport for our next part of our South African holiday.We were always notified the day prior to our trip and notified of the time we would be collected the next day. In all they could not be faulted.Vehicles clean and the staff very professional and well presented."

Very courteous, and attentive to our needs, providing water and stops when needed. the tour was good but there were some places we would like to have stayed longer.Our second tour was with another guide and we couldn't wait for it to end. The guide's accent was so heavy we gave up trying to understand him. He was nice but, not like our previous one. We asked for water and it was given reluctantly, saying it was for him and the driver. We had determined that if the same person was our guide for the third tour we wouldn't go. Fortunately our third tour was with our first guide.It all comes down to the fact that your experience is dependent on the guide and not the tour company."

Summing up let me tell you that we had to chase their office every day to get a pick up time for the next day. We believe that their office staff don't actually talk to the tour guides. Twice a guide came to the hotel when we were not due to take a tour and once advice from the office was not correct according to the tour guide who arrived a little later. This last mix up caused us a loss of at least half an hour on our Table Mountain visit. We did have some good days but overall Ilios, which is a large organisation, leave a lot to be desired."

They picked us up from Cape Town airport in the fanciest of cars Mercedes-Benz and it was a short trip to our hotel as he pointed out things to see and do. Our transports that assisted us the 2 other times during our stay in South Africa were great as well. For 2 days during our stay in Cape Town we were with Paul Plastow. He is one of the best individuals that we met our trip. He was so well informed about the history of Cape Town and South Africa. Not limited to politics but animals, nightlife, the people and agriculture. He truly made our experiences in Cape Town special as he showed us many of its offerings while tailoring the tours to us. He assisted with lunch & dinner reservations all done with a smile. Paul was a true gem and we found it a privilege to be with him during our time in Cape Town. When we return to Cape Town we will hands down 110% be requesting Paul to assist us."

            "review": "Highly Recommended Tour Company. In late September we had 3 days to explore Cape Town and booked two, full day tours with Illios. The communication with the company prior to making the bookings was prompt and efficient, we liaised with Busi. We booked the Cape Winelands full day tour and the Cape Point Peninsula Tour. Both were excellent!Reggie was our guide for the Winelands, we were picked up promptly, in an immaculate vehicle and had a wonderful day. Great commentary along the way, giving us history on the areas we were travelling through. Our first stop for coffee was at Stellenbosch, a town which had a wonderful shopping strip where I made a few lovely purchases of goods which I did not see elsewhere in Africa during our four week five country visit. The wine tastings were very well conducted during the tour and of a high standard (my husband works in the wine industry and was impressed). Reggie managed to slip in a couple of extra wine stops along the way which he said were his favourites. The restaurant where we had lunch (at our expense) was very pleasant. A thoroughly enjoyable day.The second tour we were picked up by Phillip promptly in another clean detailed vehicle, and taken to the Cape via the west coast, (Atlantic Ocean) Camps Bay beaches, Chapman's Peak drive and onto the Cape, returning via the east coast (Indian Ocean), Cape Point,lighthouse and the penguin colony. We had another enjoyable lunch stop (at our expense). Again the commentary given along the way by Phillip was excellent, however, try as he did, Phillip did not convince me, an Australian, that South Africa has the best beaches in the world! Another thoroughly enjoyable day.Can highly recommend Illios Tours to anyone visiting Cape Town. Great way to make the most of your time there and learn more about the areas in this wonderful part of the world.You can never cover the distance yourself if you chose to self-drive, nor meet the people you do, nor hear the commentary supplied.Thumbs up Illios."

We did 1. half day city tour, 2. full day cape peninsular trip, and 3. full day Stellenbosch winery tour with Ilios Travel.The drivers/guides and vehicles were great! Pleasant, punctual and very professional!They made great suggestions for eating options and provided plenty of history and information about the locations and sites. Thanks to Phillip on our full day peninsular tour for the ostrich encounter, the advice on procuring a successful seal encounter and rescuing a small person on our trip from a wasp!And many thanks to Ashraaf who showed us most of Cape Town ( including Table Mountain) and Stellenbosch. His choices of vineyards were superb and lunch spot was amazing. We really appreciated his efforts- he has enhanced our South African holiday!!We will recommend Ilios to our friends!"

            "review": "Highlights of the Cape tour with Avril and James. We were only in Cape Town for 5 nights and wanted to see as much as possible, so we booked a full day tour covering the highlights. This tour didn't disappoint! We booked a standard tour that ended up being private, which was great as it meant that we could squeeze in 3 wine tastings at the end! We were lucky enough to have 2 guides on our tour, Avril and James. They were both fantastic and really knew their stuff about every place we visited. You drive past so many interesting places and some amazing views! But while going past, you are being told what you are seeing and the history behind it which was very interesting. The enthusiasm that james has for the S African culture and history comes across and he made very entertaining. We had a lot to get through so we didn't get a lot of time in each place, but our guides made sure we had plenty of time for photo opportunities and to take in the experience.Everything we did on the tour was included in the price of our ticket, which was excellent value for money. The only thing we paid for on the day was our lunch and souvenirs.We had a fantastic day and would highly recommend this tour. Both Avril and james were great and did everything they could to make sure it was a memorable day."

We took the all day Cape Town Peninsula Tour and found it very valuable for an overview of the area with an expert guide as we did not want to rent a car. We were picked up (and returned) to our hotel and were in a van with 2 other couples (total 6 people). Our guide had some very interesting insights into the culture, history, and real estate of the area. We first stopped in a village along the waterfront with souvenir stalls and the possibility of a boat ride out to an island, then it was on to the cape where we watched playful baboons and ostriches along the way. We took the tramway for views, then a photo by the Cape of Good Hope sign. After that it was off to lunch (on your own) at a waterfront location, a visit to see the penguins, and finally a visit to the world famous Kirshenbosch Gardens. As this was a full day packed with sights, we had approximately 2 hours at the Gardens, but were told how easy it would be to return another day if one wanted an extended visit. We left at 8 in the morning and were back at our hotel by 6:30. Long day, but well worth it."

He was incredibly incredibly incredibly knowledgable on the city's history, culture and things to do in the area. I understand this is what a tour guides role entails however his attitude is what set him apart. He was immensely kind and patient. Abdul thought outside of the box thinking of additional things we could do with extra time. We initially booked our trip through a US travel agency, if I would have known booking through Ilios was an option that would have been my first choice. I know our trip would have been much different without Abdul. He truly made it enjoyable by asking questions and understanding what we wanted to get out of the trip. I will definitely recommend Ilios to anyone I know traveling to the South Africa area."

However, although the pick-up was prompt, the guide was not interested in answering questions, his body language told us it was just a \"job\". At the District 6 Museum we did not have time for more than a 20 minute taster. We spent a long time at Langa township walking around in the hot sun - rather voyeuristic. The talks by the artists at the craft centre were interesting and about the right length. We were then taken to the waterfront for lunch - but as the boat to Robben Island left at 1 o'clock we had about half an hour to grab a take-away - not at all satisfactory [there is a place on the island to buy drinks but not to stop for a meal - I suggest a packed lunch to eat on the boat]. The instructions on how to get from the drop-off point to the boarding point were useless - I would have got lost if my companions had not known the area. Then on the return a different person picked us up and stopped at a different place so finding him was difficult - in the process leaving behind one person as he had not been given a proper list."

Prior to our visit, we booked a private shuttle to and from the airport, a private cape point tour and a private wine lands tour through Ilios Travel. Also during our visit, we booked a whale watching tour through Ilios Travel. On our first day during the Cape Point tour, we toured the typical sites, but at the end of the tour, the tour guide took us to a Jewelry store in Cape Town. This was obviously a scam where if we would have purchased jewelry, either the tour guide or Ilios Travel would have made a commission on the sale. If I wanted to buy jewelry while in South Africa, I could have went to the jewelry store myself vs. paying a private tour guide. This leads me to believe there are other scams of this type in all of their tours! Beware!The next day, we went on the Whale Watching tour which was amazing, but my wife started getting sick by the end of the trip so we decided to cancel our private wine tour which was scheduled the following day. Since we did not cancel the tour with 24 hours\u2019 notice, Ilios Travel only refunded $25 of approximately $1,000. They claim they could only refund $25 associated with the \"entrance fees portion of the trip\" because the remainder of the cost was spent on \"sales team processing enquiries, time and effort spent\" and \"operations planning\". What about the money that would have been spent on gas to drive to a from the winelands? That money was never spent! I've been in sales for the past 11 years and continually work with my customers when issues like these arise. I completely understand there are certain costs which are already spent, but to only refund $25 of approximately $1,000 is unacceptable, especially when a customer booked all their Cape Town activities through your company. In my opinion, this is extremely poor customer service so I highly recommend staying away from Ilios Travel, unless you're in the market for some jewelry!"

They picked us up at our Sea Point accommodation, then we rode in a van with 4 other guests. We stopped at Camps Bay for photos, then Houts Bay for more photos & souvineer shopping. We had 2 stops at the Cape, then enough time with the Boulder's Beach penguins before heading back to Cape Town. We loved JC's stories about the history of the area, the landscape, etc. And he made sure everyone was comfortable along the way. The trip was great value for money."

            "review": "Outstanding Value for the Money. On a recent visit to Cape Town, I took an Ilios full-day tour of the Cape, which included round trip bus transportation from the V & A Waterfront to the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point Lighthouse. I was so impressed, as the views are stunning and the tour price also included admission to Boulders Beach for penguin viewing and Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. There is also time built into the schedule for lunch and individual sightseeing. Jonathan was our tour guide and he was extremely pleasant, informative, and entertaining. I highly recommend this tour for any first-time visitors to the area. It was so much more relaxing to not have to worry about driving or traffic on a guided tour."

Our guides Walter, for the first week, and Danson, for the second, we're both knowledgeable, engaging and very helpful and friendly; and knew the best \"Kodak moments\". The accommodation was without exception excellent, although special mention should go to Ghost Mountain Inn and Hunter's Lodge both of which had a unique ambiance. The itinerary provided a wonderful mix of wildlife (game drives, river safaris, conservation reserves), scenic drives, historical and cultural experiences, with a good balance of city and country making for a truly memorable holiday.We had hoped for a trip of a lifetime, Ilios not only delivered but exceeded our expectations, and we hope to return to South Africa. Our thanks to Trailfinders who we booked through, Ilios and particularly Walter and Danson."

A warm welcome at the airport was a sign of the level of service we were to receive through out our time in the Cape. Travelling on small mini-bus with extremely well informed guides, we saw some amazing places. Strongly recommend the Cape Point tour, I cant remember the names of our two guides (Thursday 11 August), but they were so much fun and really informative, really making us feel that they were proud to be showing us their home!All other tours were excellent, and transfers to/ from Franschhoek felt like an additional tour. Don't drive, see the country, hear about what you are seeing, use Ilios Travel."

Next couple of days were spent with Rory our Ilios guide who took us on various trips and visits. Rory was very knowledgeable and full of little pieces of information. We then carried on down the garden route under Rory,s guidance,we finally said good bye to him in Port Elizabeth. We then flew up to Johannesburg where we met Nelson our new guide. We spent the next couple of days with Nelson working our way down the panorama route. Nelson was also friendly and full of little snippets of information. We finally said good bye to Nelson in Hazyview where we went on to a Nature Reserve for a few days before flying home. If Rory and Nelson are typical of Ilios guides I would happily recommend them to all. They made an interesting time great."

He was our first introduction to the beautiful city and did a fantastic job. The next day things changed. We booked, via Expedia, a full day city tour which was to include Table Mountain, Robben Island, multiple museums as well as a guided city tour. We were told that Table Mountain was weather dependent. It was a beautiful sunny day. When we were picked up by our guide we were immediately told that the likely hood of getting up TM was doubtful because of the lines. Other guides wait inline for clients, not Ilios. Were were driven to TM and told that if we wanted to do Robben Island we could not do TM. Ridiculous!!!! This was why we booked the tour! Each museum we stopped at we were told that we did not have time to take the provided tours because we would miss Robben Island. What incredibly poor planning for a tour. Also...we paid for round trip transportation to our hotel. However, we had to beg to be taken back. Awkward!!! All in all this was extremely disappointing."

Our first segment was a half day during which we went up Table Mountain and visited the slave museum. We then walked through town and briefly visited the South Africa Museum. He never rushed us and in fact accommodated us going a bit overtime.Our next two days were fabulous and Peter did an excellent job of pointing out highlights, putting them in the context of his own family history, and adjusting the itinerary based on our interests and when the Robbin Island boat was cancelled due to weather. I highly recommend Peter and based on our experience would use this company again. Hopefully I will return to Cape Town some day!"

Abdul Clarke met our large group (6 adults and 6 teens) at Port Elizabeth airport on June 27, and for the next six days, became an honorary member of our families as we traveled the Garden Route and toured Cape Town. His knowledge captivated us with facts about the history of South Africa and the settlement and development of Cape Town, punctuated by his (well justified) pride and passion for this lovely and vibrant city. No question went unanswered, and we really tried to stump him! He indicated that he prepares diligently for his clients, researching their home countries and also participates in various continuing education programs. We enjoyed his quick wit and humor, which made the long drives fly by. Although only scheduled to be with us for four days, he asked to be assigned to us on tours of the Cape and Wine Region (on his scheduled days off) which were outstanding. Above all, his concern for our safety, keeping us on time (which was challenging with our group) and his flexibility on excursions and schedule was his priority. I cannot say enough great things about how our families (young and not-so-young) bonded with Abdul. While our trip to South Africa will provide us with lasting memories, Abdul will certainly be one of our favorites. We will strongly recommend him to family and friends traveling to South Africa."

Ilios provided us with a number of services on our recent trip to Cape Town - airport pick up and drop off and tours to Cape Point and the Winelands. The services were, without fail, excellent. The airport pickup and dropoff were seamless, the drivers pleasant, the vehicles of the highest standard. The kind touch of the driver welcoming us with a coll bottle of water on our arrival was much appreciated. The tours were also great. If I have a comment it is more by way of a recommendation - I didn't know that there was a cash-only payment add-on on the Cape Point tour, a trip on a boat to Seal Island. Luckily I had enough cash on me, and I would have brought warmer clothes if i had known. However I think that was probably a missed communication between our travel agent and us. I would definitely recommend this company's services."

We recently did two tours with this company, the half day city tour with Icraam and the Peninsula and Cape Point tour with Jean and Azeem.The half day tour was really good but unfortunately the weather was very overcast and foggy and we weren't able to go up Table Mountain. Icraam was a fantastic guide! However, the one downside was the other family on our tour who continually interrupted and lagged behind and generally wanted to be anywhere but on the tour. I realise this is out of the company's control but it's a shame inconsiderate people ruin it for others.Again, the peninsula tour was great but the weather wasn't great again and it poured rain and was very windy. Regardless we had a great day and the sun came out later in the day. Jean was a great guide and had some great jokes interspersed in his commentary. Again out of the company's control, but I thought I'd put it in as a recommendation, the place we stopped for lunch (sorry, I can't remember it's name) had a very racist lady serving who referred to the three Asian looking guys on our tour as 'The Chinese'. I know it's one person but feedback should definitely be given because that's a really bad way to conduct yourself in a professional environment."

Our guide/driver, Shareef, promptly arrived every morning, and was extremely knowledgeable and professional. He made suggestions of excellent restaurants when we made stops, and was very personable and fun. We never had to think about what was next, he took care of us. He gave us extra time when we were more interested at an attraction. We were actually too early to see whales in Hermanus, so he took us to see more penguins at Betty's Bay because I love penguins. We wanted to go to a specific restaurant in Cape Town, and he dropped us off there instead of our hotel, which saved us a taxi fare. We also had transfers from airports set up with Ilios, and our drivers met us with signs as soon as we arrived. The drivers were all professional. One even took us to a good place to exchange our money to South African Rand. We highly recommend Ilios Travel and Shareef!!!"

I decided to stay a few days longer so I could also visit Cape Town. As I was traveling alone on this leg of the journey, I wanted to make sure that I had airport transfers and tours lined up in advance of my trip. I booked through Expedia and the travel company (which had good reviews) was Ilios Travel. Here are my impressions:1. Airport transfer: I arrived at 9:30pm from Johannesburg. My driver was 25 minutes late. While I realize that a driver can be late for a multitude of legitimate reasons, it is important to make sure that there is good communication with the client. I would recommend that Ilios make sure that they have a specific protocol so that the client is informed. Because I was traveling alone and had been warned about not getting into a vehicle with just anyone, it was important to me to have my transfer arranged in advance. That said, when I called the after hours number, there was a response and the agent on duty was able to contact the driver, so I was able to get to the hotel without making alternate arrangements. I did complain to the company and they delivered a nice bottle of wine to me with their deepest regrets. The transfer back to the airport was early, which was great, and I was delivered to the airport in plenty of time (I don't mind having extra time at the airport!).2. Full day Robben Island & City Tour: The driver, Michael, picked me up promptly and in time to get me to the ferry terminal for the 9am tour. The tour itself was OK--because it represents what I think is a sad time in South African history, the tour was not a fun time, but it was interesting and informative. The ferry was a full hour later than Michael expected getting back but he was waiting for me. We picked up a few more people for the city tour and changed vehicles and the tour was great. Although most of the day Table Mountain had been shrouded in fog, at 4pm the fog lifted and we were able to go up in the cable car and spend an hour at the top. It was great. Highly recommend!3. Full Day Cape Tour: I was the last passenger picked up and while it was a full van, it was comfortable and pleasant. The driver and guide (I don't know how to spell his name but he said you could remember it if you could remember \"red wine\") were great. The weather was spectacular and we took the short boat trip to see the seals, had a great time at the cape and cape point, and then saw the penguins before a great seafood lunch at Simons Town. The last thing we did was to go to the botanical gardens--it was the least interesting thing to me on the trip because of the time of year (not many flowering plants) but it is a beautiful place. Highly recommend!4. Cape Wine Tour: What an awesome day! On time pick up by the great tour guide Jean Martin. I was picked up first at my Cape Town hotel and we drove to Stellenbach where we picked up the others who joined the tour. It was a delightful group from Australia and I had so much fun! The wineries on the tour (and the wine) were a delight! The time we had to walk around the towns was adequate. The real treat came with the last winery of the day who had great pairings with chocolate! After the others left to go back to their hotel, Jean took me to a great jewelry shop because I told him I hadn't had a chance to do any shopping for a particular piece that I wanted. He was great. Ilios Travel in Cape Town is a class act. Highly recommend!Booking in advance through Expedia was great and although there was some concern when I first arrived, I was very happy with Ilios Travel and the staff. I really enjoyed my time in Cape Town!"

On the cape point trip the weather was foggy which meant that we didn't spend as long as cape point as scheduled, however later in the day this time wasn't given back to the tour and we arrived back at our hotel an hour earlier than advertised. Our airport transfers were arranged with more than enough time before our flight but when our hotel concierge questioned the pick up time as being too early, Ilios travel lied about our flight departure time bringing it forward by 30 mins meaning more wasted time in an airport departure lounge. They aren't a bad company to use but if you are spending limited time in South Africa just be aware of their approach to scheduling."

We carried out all our business on-line and found it very easy especially with the prompt replies from Glen. We were booking for up to 8 people, some of which were already on the ship somewhere around Australia but with the help from Glen there was no problem regarding payment. When we arrived in Cape Town we were met by Johnathon, our guide and driver, who turned out to be a very knowledgeable person and had an extremely good sense of humour which went down very well with us all. Our trip was for 9 hours and the price was 50% less than that of the one run by the tours on the ship. Admittedly, lunch was not included but we did have a lunch stop in a restaurant in Simonstown but the cost for 2 people, including drinks, was only 300 rand (approx \u00a315). Our day was never dull and full of surprises around every corner and every stop. Top marks to Ilios Travel and Johnathon. This is a company we would certailny use again and have no problems in recommending them to anyone."

Our group of 2 couples pre-booked the tour and, as always, wondered about what we would end up with for our trip to Cape of Good Hope and the Stellenbosch winery district.Our tour guide (please don't call me the driver) Jean Martin arrived right on time, and immediately put our minds at ease and we knew we were in for a good day. After picking up the other three passengers we headed through the Cape Town traffic to Mariners Wharf for some seal spotting before going through Chapmans Bay area and down to Cape Point/Cape of Good Hope. Jean displayed his wealth of knowledge along the way and was very happy to answer our queries and questions plus tell some jokes and funny stories.The vehicle was comfortable, as was the timeframe that allowed us to spend enough time at each scenic spot, and not feel rushed.The drive to Cape Point was interesting and we did see baboons, ostrich and zebras along the way. Jean was happy to stop and enable us to take the obligatory photos of these rare sightings.After making our way to the penguin colony near Simons Town, we then continued around False Bay and up to Bilton Wines, outside Stellenbosch. We were treated to a decadent tasting of wine and chocolate - a real treat!It was then time to headed back to Cape Town, via the N1 motorway. The 10 hour day was very much worthwhile and a must for anyone visiting Cape Town and wants to see what is to offer in the western cape."

Some timing and organisation issues which made for an awkward start to our first day visit up Table Mountain. We were about 2 hours late in total because people were told at the start of the visit they needed to buy entry online and print out. Apparently, the printer in the hotel was broken and thus set off a chain of unfortunate events. People were irritated by the loss of time which could have been avoided with forethought. As a group, we became increasingly concerned when we were not updated about the timings and itinerary for the day . If there were delays due to lack of clear communication the fault was never with Ilios although in fact, it was. This was annoying and upsetting for the group who began to feel that they were there for the convenience of Ilios rather than than the opposite case since we had paid the company for our convenience. A lot if grumbling was unsettling and not what anyone wants on their holiday. We lost opportunities to do and see things which were on the itinerary because Ilios worked to their own convenience and not ours. This improved after our concerns were voiced. We were using Ilios from the Durban route to Johannesburg and it was a much better experience all round. Lutendo was a wonderful guide. Clear, well organised , couldn't do enough for us. He was magnificent and reaffirmed our faith in the company yo put the client first. The drivers were all very good. I'd use Ilios again if I could guarantee I'd be led by Lutendo. Thank you! I hope you get the pay rise you deserve Lutendo. We were all impressed by your knowledge, clarity and professionalism. Thanks again."

From what we observed during the numerous tours we took while staying in Cape Town, Ilios Travel appeared as a medium scale company and was expanding. We took tours organised by the company for four consecutive days visiting places such as Cape Point, Robben Island, Township, District Six, City Tour and Wine Tour. The services they provided exceeded my expectation. The tours were well-organised and they would leave you a message the night before with your hotel concierge informing in the event that there was a change of pick-up time. The guides were all professional and knowledgeable. They were mostly locals who grew up in the town and their narrations were like telling their own stories which were highly intriguing. They were extremely punctual and vehicles used were clean and of good condition. I highly recommend this company."

Our first day experience with Ilios was amazing and we enjoyed every subsequent experience with them. Honestly, they were the meat and potatoes to our trip as we relied upon them to get us to airports on time, pick us up and take us to our new accommodations and show us the area via private tours. Talk about feeling like a queen....picked up in Mercedes SUV's, first class all the way. Stop at an ATM and you feel like the Secret Service has got your back keeping too friendly locals or confused tourists from getting TOO close. One of my friends is relatively well known and when he joined us, Ilios just stepped it up a notch even more. Now, as far as guides, Shamiel is the most amazing guide ever. We spent a full day with him exploring the winelands and he is a blast. Felt like hanging out with an incredibly bright, hysterical friend! Besides knowing so much about local culture, cuisine, the best beaches, camera parts and where to go for them, he is so funny and just a genuinely GOOD man that loves his job and loves his family. We miss that guy! Our other favorite was our young driver Enslin out of Port Elizabeth. This guy is very outgoing, a great driver, protector of the clueless and can really yell in Afrikkans (inside joke in case he is reading this!) All of our Ilios guys were awesome, but had to give these two a special shout out! When we return, Ilios is a must. I don't know what we would have done without them. When my friends told me I was crazy bringing my teenage daughter with me to South Africa (just us 2), I knew we were in safe hands with Ilios."

Second day - Winelands- This was incredible we went with an incredible tour guide - he was so funny, can't remember his name but was bald and had a very loud voice haha! Our trip was fantastic with 18 tastings- in three completely different wineries! My fav tour I've ever done! Also was great to view the small towns around the vineyards too! Absolutely awesome!Day three we went to Cape Point with Danny! An excellent guide! Went to a beautiful restaurant before going upto Cape Point! An excellent tour for anyone visiting Cape Town! Was also fantastic going to Boulders beach to see the penguins. A MUST DO TRIP! This company were also our airport transfer- ALWAYS on time and so so organised! Couldn't recommend them more!!!

            "review": "A Story off two Halves. We were staying in Capetown and booked two tours through the Ilios rep in our hotel. The rep was helpful and informative and the bookings went well. So...lets start with the good part. Our first tour was a day wine tasting around various vineyards in the Franschhoek region. We were picked up at the hotel as arranged. The vehicle was very comfortable and roomy. Our guide for the day was nothing short of fantastic and really made the day special. We visited a chocolate factory, three Vineyards and had a lovely lunch in Franschhoek. Overall the day was outstandingly good. The following day we had booked the the 'Walk to Freedom' tour and things didn't go quite as well as they should have. Our guide and vehicle were great and the morning went well with visits to District 6, key locations in Capetown and Langha...so no issue there however the second part of the day was a trip to Robin Island. Everyone else on the bus had tickets for the one PM ferry however our tickets were absent and we were later told we had been booked on the 3pm Ferry. This had never been communicated to us at any time so completely spoilt the day and in any case we already had plans which meant a late ferry was not possible. Their plan had been to let the group go, return us to the hotel, let us kick our heels for a few hours and then put us on the later ferry with no pick up afterwards.... Ok...so sometimes things go wrong and I accept that ... but the way we were subsequently treated by the Ilios Manager, Rasheed, was nothing short of a disgrace. He promised to call us within the hour after speaking to him at the hotel when we got back..no call came. We spoke to another rep later in the evening and again we were promised a call back from him... Nothing. When we got back late that evening, a bottle of wine and a rather defensive apology letter was waiting but the letter completely missed the point we had made. The following day we again asked to speak to the manager, he was called and promised a call back within the hour...no call came. After having checked the hotel bill, we had been charged for the full days tour so that evening, we insisted on speaking to the manager on the phone...the phone was passed and his apology for never phoning us back was half hearted and frankly insulting. I insisted that they adjust the bill, as they had said they would do two days earlier and it took my insistence to get it finally sorted. The point I make here is that, given the excellent offering this company makes in terms of guides and tours, on this occasion they were badly let down by a Manager that clearly couldn't have cared less about communicating with his customers. Whilst I had a particular issue with their service, I have still given the rating I have because I do believe the company provides good tours and if Rasheed had been more focused on his customers and had just done what he promised to do, it would have been a faultless review from me."

Tour included hotel pick up and drop off which started at 8:30am and ended at 6pm. Driver picked us up on time but had troubles finding another guest's accommodation which caused a bit of delay, we had to join the coach at Camp's Bay and the tour started just after 9am. Tour guide was very knowledgeable and friendly, the tour was enjoyable and the scenic routes was absolutely amazing! Entry to Boulder's beach (penguins) and Kirstenbosch included in the tour price.Robin Island, Table Mountain and City tour - there was a mix up with the booking and we had to wait for half an hour for the driver to pick us up which we almost missed the 9am ferry from V&A waterfront to Robben Island. We were supposed to be on a group tour, but ended up going to Robben Island on our own without a tour guide from Ilios. Disappointed with the mix up and how we were left on our own but this didn't stop us from enjoying Robben Island as there was a tour guide at hand for all the visitors. Tour consisted of two parts: inside the prison talk and bus tour around the island; lasted approx. 3 hours. Took ferry back to V&A where a driver came to pick us up and drove us to Table Mountain along with 4 other guests. We started quite late for Table Mountain due to waiting around for other guests which meant we had a very short city tour and did not get to visit the museums that was part of the tour.Overall, drivers and tour guides were knowledgeable but there was disorganisation particularly with our booking and as a result, some delays that cost us missing out on museum visits. I would still recommend booking tours when visiting Cape Town to make the most of the wonderful views and historical places to visit."

The next day we joined a group and travelled by mini bus to Kruger Game Reserve and went on 2 game drives there (seeing the big 5 and so much more). From there we went on a further safari and 2 wetland safaris, on through Swaziland. We visited a genuine Zulu village where we met Justice who was so enthusiastic about explaining the Zulu culture. we flew from Durban to Port Elizabeth. How could the holiday improve, but it did! We were met by Dino, our amazing guide, who was to spend the second week taking us on down to Cape Town, via the Garden Route and the wine lands. Dino was a mine of information who made the trip not only informative, but also fun. He joined in with all our banter and was flexible in allowing us to choose variations to the itinerary. While the whole Ilios team were highly efficient and helpful, Dino was a star act. Thank you all, for a fabulous experience - good hotels, stunning scenery, with a wide range of cultural experiences. From Robben Island, through incredible wild life and people, to the beauty and vibrancy of Cape Town. (not to mention being able to play with a cheetah!). What would I have left out?

The guide was great throughout and provided useful insight. We were then dropped at the Robben Island ferry. After we had finished on Robben Island we were picked up and dropped to our hotel,"

We were given a time of an 8:30am pickup from the hotel, which was reconfirmed but the hotel. We came down to reception at the Bay Hotel only to be told by the Ilios driver and tour guide that we should have been there at 8:15. Apparently the driver was overheard being told on the phone to go without us as we were late. Anyway, the driver waited, and we hopped onto the tour bus only to be subject to a tirade of abuse by an absolutely revolting Irish woman, who was there with her husband and 2 children. Obviously she blamed us for being late, which was absolutely not the case.We could not bare the atmosphere on the tour bus and asked to get off immediately.Clearly, Ilios can't do anything about revolting people, but it can sort out its communication of pickup times. When I spoke to a girl at Ilios she seemed content to blame our hotel for the error without any sort of apology for the unpleasantness that the situation created. And when I asked for a refund, it was refused. Very very poor service.We ended up paying for a private tour so we are out out pocket twice. Not happy!! Ilios, you are a customer service provider with no customer service!! Wake up!! and where's my refund?"

If you are looking at tour companies, I probably don't need to sell you on the destination. I'm not so familiar with Ilios as a company, as it was they were contracted by our trip planner, but we did have 5 extremely fun, informative and beautiful days of private tours with one of their guides named Naser. Our trip in South Africa took us from a safari in Kruger to the winelands region outside of Cape Town to Cape Town proper. We had Naser as our guide in the winelands and Cape Town. Within an hour of meeting him, on the way to a whale watching tour, Naser already got to know us, what sort of sites and experiences we were interested in, and also had us laughing despite being early in the morning. From the first day, he gave us thoughtful, personal recommendations of places to see and activities to try. The vineyards he suggested were amazing for different reasons - whether for the quality of the wines, the historical context or just worthwhile for a picture or two, he gave us amazing options to choose from. Even when we were based in Cape Town, he helped us pick and choose experiences that made for unforgettable days. One day, we started by paragliding from Lion's Head (a mountain) to Camp's Bay, went to a jewelry store to browse some Tanzanite pieces and grab a coffee, and then in the Malay section for colorful houses and amazing Cape Malay cuisine. Another day, we went ziplining, had lunch at one of the best restaurants in the country (La Colombe; which he secured a very last minute booking for us), and ended up strolling the Company Gardens in Cape Town. He was very entertaining, but also knew how to give my new bride and I space to enjoy experiences on our own. He was extremely kind, and always willing to take pictures for us. He also has photography experience, so the pictures turned out great! He was like the mayor of Cape Town. Everywhere we went, he knew people, was able to get great tables, and skip lines. It's a great sign when people smile when they would see him coming. We highly recommend private tours with Naser no matter what you are looking for \u2013 upscale dining, spontaneous adventures, natural beauty, historical narratives, or any combination of them all."

Because they did not work to checklists by name (as does every just about every other company I have done day or partial day trips with around the world), I'm not surprised this happens and expect it is common with them. For another half-day afternoon wine tasting tour, the trip was cut almost half because the guide was running late on another booking and the wineries close by around 5 pm.

Had a half day tour to the Cape of Good Hope with a stop at Hout Bay (too choppy to go to Seal Island that day), the Cape and Cape Point Light House with a stop on the way back at Boulder's Bay to see the Penguins. Ah-men was my driver and he was very knowledgeable."

They collected us from airports, helped us move from hotel to hotel and taken us on two fantastic tours, the wine region and Cape peninsula. We've had 6 different drivers, all were very professionally, very knowledgable and most importantly, they all added to to make our first time in South Africa more pleasurable, more insightful and more educating that we'd expected. On both our personal tours we were chauffeured by Peter Meyer, without him, neither tour would have been as interesting and as enjoyable as they were. I can't recommend the service Ilios has provided enough, they've helped make our time in SA so memorable."

Thorough education of the history of the area was given by Sharif and this continued at District 6 and then to the township of Langa where we saw projects to engage the population. The tour of Langa was such an eye opener. People were friendly and new housing is slowly improving lives but there's a long way to go.After this we visited Robben Island which was very humbling."

I scheduled a wine tasting tour with Ilios through my hotel. $71 USD for the full day of transportation and guide to three wineries and lunch in Franschnoek which is a lovely town. I was touring alone but mixed very well with 12 others on the tour. First we visited Anura where we sampled 6 wines with cheese, crackers, and jam. Next was Solms Delta where we enjoyed 10 (yes 10!) samples. Then an hour for lunch on our own in Franschnoek. And finally 5 wines paired perfectly with chocolate at Lanzerac. It was a very lovely day getting out into wine country of South Africa. Yes, $71 covered everything but lunch!"

Then each day we were in Cape Town we had a different tour booked. City tour, Robben Island and township tour, winelands tour and Cape tour. Each day ilios emailed up to date pick up times to our apartment who passed on the details to us. They were very prompt and always welcoming. Each tour was fantastic with amazing guides and drivers. 2 of our tours were done by Philip who was fabulous giving advice about places to eat, wines to try as well as having an excellent knowledge of the area. We also had tours from Adiel and Nazeem both fantastic. Due to bad weather we couldn't use the cable car to travel up table mountain or visit the botanical gardens on another trip, each time another option was discussed and arranged to fill our time. We can not recommend Ilios enough for making the start of our holiday so memorable. We have learnt so much from listening to your guides. Thank you!!!!"

We were so lucky to have been placed with Omar Sarrs both days. He was extremely knowledgable, friendly, thoughtful, and was a very good driver. We learned so much about Cape Town and the surrounding areas that we visited. We traveled to the Cape of Good Hope, Hermanus, Stellenbosch, Wineland, and he even picked us up early on the second day so we could visit the Cheetah Conservation Center when he learned the cheetah was my husband's favorite animal. We enjoyed both of the restaurants he recommended we try and on the second day, we were able to convince him to have lunch with us. We really enjoyed our time with Omar and will remember him fondly as a great part of our trip to Africa."

The Hyundai H1 was a nice car though not suitable for this type of touring. Garth would point out things of interest and unless you were in the front seat you couldn't see the landmark as the windows are very low. I wrote this on our feedback sheet after the first 2 days of touring and when we did our wine lands tour 3 days later we had a Mercedes people mover which has high windows and is a much better vehicle for this type of work Would I use Ilios again for touring, absolutely, they were fantastic"

We enjoyed his company so much so that we personally requested him for the transfer back where he took us a longer route (the Panorama) and we stopped to view some of the sites. By the end of these two drives we felt like we made a new friend. Mmeli asked to see wedding photos and we really connected. He is an amicable person who drove safely and made the experience even better. Thank you so much Mmeli!

He skillfully avoided the crowds and as a result we enjoyed the best day out, seeing as much as we could without feeling rushed. The highlight for me was seeing the Penguins and Boulders beach, but loved seeing ostriches in the wild near Cape Point which is an awesome place. Rob had to stop the van to assist a tortoise who was crossing the road at the Cape of Good Hope, we loved that.Chapmans Peak Drive on the way back to Cape Town is stunning. Rob is a smashing guy who has great knowledge of the Cape and probably owes a lot of this knowledge to his Uncle Carl, a legend by all accounts! Thanks for a Fabulous day out Rob, it made our 30th Wedding Anniversary unforgettable. We will remember to bring you some pickled onion monster munch next time we visit Cape Town! Julie & Dave x"

First, we were fortunate enough to have Rob as our tour guide - and while I'm sure all of Rob's guides are great, Rob's humor rivals that of John Oliver. In addition to being extraordinarily funny, Rob's knowledge of the sites was impressive. Having done this for a while, Rob was able to time our tour to avoid large crowds - so we could enjoy ourselves a great deal more.What truly sets Rob and Cape Convoy apart is the love of the area. So many tours feel robotic - where the guide(s) drone on in a monotone way, repeating the same thing they say every day. Rob's love of the area, however, is infectious, and as he explains things (and provides wonderful asides along the way,) you can hear (and feel) the passion, which only makes the experience even better.If you're looking for a tour that has surgical precision and gives only the facts and nothing more, you should look elsewhere (though I'm sure if you asked, Rob would accommodate). However, if you're looking for a guide/company that has soul - and will afford you both an educational and extremely enjoyable trip, Cape Convoy is the way to go. I'll be passing Rob's information on to anyone I know that's going to visit Cape Town - and I share my great experience with the TripAdvisor community as well, because you deserve to know where you can find the best."

Rob respected our time and made sure we saw everything and took us to the hotspots to beat the big tourist tours so we can enjoy the landscape and take our photos. The tour was organic. If nature was there, we stopped to take it in. For example, there were two ostriches by the coast on the way to the Cape. Rob stopped the van so we came take pictures and then tell us a bit about the ostrich. His attitude and presentation were great and lighthearted. Rob made sure everyone on the tour had a good time. I would totally recommend this tour to anyone. It is a great way to get another view on South Africa that is not a cookie cutter tour and can be as fun and interesting as the participants make it. Best of luck to you Rob and Cape Convoy!"

No matter how great the scenery on the Cape was, I would argue that I'll remember the day moreso for Rob's touring style. From young to old, the whole minivan was entertained for the whole (and I mean whole) day with engaging and thorough local history (you wouldn't have thought he was a Pom!), personal anecdotes and hilarious off-the-cuff one-liners. Excellent idea (moreso in hindsight) to have a single meeting point in the morning (you'll realise this when you do other tours in Cape Town). Great idea to hit the Cape first to avoid midday lines. Excellent decisions to stop off at some not-so-well-known but very scenic areas. And solid tips throughout the day to make the most of each stop-off.On the face of it, the tour price may seem comparatively on the high side; however, I do believe it's worth it. And Rob mate: Here's a random pic of a dassie to mull over (and the selfie as promised)"

He is very experienced, knowledgeable and entertaining. He planned the schedule perfectly as we always seemed to get to the sights before the big crowds - no time to waste! We had 7 people in our group and it was a good size. Rob kept us entertained throughout the day with just the right balance of history, politics, culture and fun facts and stories. You hit all the sights with plenty of time for each. Rob even has tips for some of the sights so you get the best views or avoid hassle/crowds. My only disappointment is that the tour doesn't include Seal island which would have been nice to visit. Having said that, the day was already jam packed without it so it might have been too much to have it in the schedule anyways.Overall - really really good tour. Highly recommend! I would even do it again."

Rob stood out as on our wavelength ( after seeing his You Tube feed - ably assisted by his daughter). We were not disappointed !!!!Rob arranged airport transfers for us with a lovely man Ibrahim who was early on both pick ups & very friendly and informative on our drive to the hotel & back.Our first tour was to the winelands. I had specifically asked for a particular 2 vineyards & asked for the location of the 2nd to be kept a secret until we arrived. (Which they did). Our guide Rene was absolutely wonderful. She booked us a masterclass at Fairview prior to meeting us but told us there was no obligation if we didn't fancy it. This was one of the highlights of the day, in a private tasting room they bring you 8 different wines from to taste in order with the 8 sample cheeses on your individual board and explain all about the wines you are drinking. Was fabulous with the wine barrels on view through a glass wall. We invited Rene to dine with us for a late lunch and declined a further vineyard so that we could enjoy her company and tales of life in Cape Town and of South Africa's history. A member of our party mentioned a township trip & a few days later Rene contacted me to say she had made a booking at a township restaurant Lelapa (again there would be no problem if we didn't fancy it). What a great experience. A buffet meal within a family house. Loved Sheila's take on the world ( and how we're ruled by watches) with a band playing xylophones and drums traditional & modern music. The variety on the buffet was completely unexpected & the food delicious. Our 2nd trip was with Rob to the Cape Peninsula. He tailored our trip to our party, taking us to a 2nd entrance for the Boulders Bay penguins so my mum wouldn't have to walk far. He planned the day to minimise the queues and regaled us with life observations and dodgy jokes. Would highly recommend Cape Convoy, everyone we met through them came across genuinely friendly and enthusiastic to share information about their town. Booking from England was easy & Rob always responded quickly to any queries. We were a party of 7 and all 3 vehicles used were modern, clean & comfortable. These guys work long hours to make sure you have a good experience and a full day. Thank you all x"

We appreciated the group meeting at the waterfront instead of individual pick ups, that way we didn't waste time in the van.

She then took us to the boat trip area where we spent a great 2 hours whale watching.Going home Rene drove the coastal route via Bettys Bay where we walked the route where thousands of penguins gather because of the abundance of fish there.The rest of the journey back to Capetown along the coast had views that were totally stunning and Rene would stop wherever we wanted to take photos.All through the day Rene was barraged with hundreds of questions from us and was more than happy to answer them and her knowledge and friendly helpfulness was much appreciated.I hope we can return to Capetown and when we do....Rob will be the first person i will call."

We booked 2 tours with Rob at Cape Convoy - the Cape Point tour and the Winelands.He took us for our day out to Cape Point - he was on time meeting us and full of enthusiasm for our day. We were a small group of 6 and he made sure we arrived at the Cape early in order to miss the coach tours when it would be really busy. We stopped for every photo opportunity and even waited for the sun to set so we could get great photos! Rob was a brilliant guide - he was entertaining and not only knowledgeable about the places we visited - we learned such a lot about South Africa and it's history - his passion for the country really came across.The next day we had Rene as our guide to the Winelands. She was lovely and again, very knowledgeable - not only about the places we visited but very informative about anything we asked! We started off at Ernie Els' winery which is absolutely beautiful. It was a sunny morning with not many visitors so we just sat on the terrace, tasted the wine and looked at the amazing views. As there were only the 3 of us, Rene was happy for us to take our time which suited us! We went to one other winery in Stellenbosch and then she took us to an amazing restaurant in Franschhoek for lunch.We thoroughly enjoyed both our tours with Cape Convoy - as well as visiting places on a map, we gained a real insight into South Africa and it's people and had 2 fabulous days which we will remember for a long time!"

We covered so much in a single day, and the guy knows the town very well obviously, and he has a great sense of humor. But I feel that what really makes this tour so great is the way Rob just honestly wants you to have a good time."

It could be a fun group or sadly a quite boring group. Our group was awesome. The group was a mix of Americans and a couple from Singapore. Then our tour guide was the amazing Rob. We started early in the morning, then arrived back in the evening. The sights we saw were so many like Rhodes Monument, Signal Hill, Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope, Sky Harbor Beach, Boulders Park with the penguins, Cape Point Ostrich Farm, Simmons Town, Hout Bay, and Chapman's Peak. For an all day tour, it was jammed pack of great places in Cape Town. Not only were we able to see so many places, Rob had wonderful information about Cape Town and filled us in on history and answered any of our questions. Then we heard the fun stories of past tours. I was not able to do the Winelands tour with Cape Convoy, but I imagine it would be great as well. I highly recommend Cape Convoy and Rob as your tour guide. Rob added a lot to the trip with his fun, happy, honest personality. I am extremely lucky that he was our tour guide. You won't be disappointed if you select Cape Convoy Tours. I will definitely be doing future tours with only Cape Convoy Tours when back in Cape Town."

Rob switched the days of our scheduled tours to make sure we had the best weather for the Cape Point tour which was a treat. We saw beautiful sights, had time to walk to the Cape Point Lighthouse and beyond, and laughed the whole way. We wound up not doing the Winelands tour with Rob because of scheduling changes, but he made sure we were taken care of with another tour company. We can't say enough good things about Rob's customer service and humor - you'll laugh the whole way and learn a lot about Cape Town and surrounding areas."

She made sure that we enjoy to the fullest and take beautiful memories back with us . She stopped by the most scenic spots on the way to Cape Point . She acted as a photographer for us ;-) She is awesome . Thumbs up . We forgot our bag in the bus and she dropped it at our hotel which was a great gesture of hers despite of us collecting from her . Incase you are looking for a cape point tour then without any doubts go for Rene and CapeConvoy . Excellent operator with excellent people."

He kept an eye on the weather and managed to time all of our stops when it wasn't raining. Of course, the penguins were a favorite but we also enjoyed seeing Cape Point and all of the areas nestled along the coast. Bonus points for a sighting of two ostriches and a few baboons.

            "review": "Cape Convoy - A Mixed Experience. My wife and I booked two day tours with Cape Convoy: the Cape Point Tour and the Winelands Tour. Rene was our tour guide on the Cape Point tour. The substance of the tour was great. The weather was very cooperative, and the Point itself with its funicular and views was spectacular. And on the drive to and from the Point we stopped at an Ostrich farm, stopped again and saw some penguins close-up, checked out a harbor and naval base, and also had a great seafood lunch. Rene was a good guide and she happily dropped us back at our CBD hotel after the tour. The only issue with the tour was meeting up at the very beginning. Our instructions were to be at the entrance to the Victoria and Albert Hotel on the waterfront from 0820 to 0840, and my wife and there were there waiting well before 0820. But Rene did not approach us until about 0845, and we were a bit worried that somehow we had made a location mistake. I am not sure why this meetup issue happened. There were many vehicles and people around the entrance to the hotel while we waited, so I think we just didn\u2019t see each other. In the future, perhaps Cape Convoy should use one of those magnetic signs on the outside of its vehicles so the vehicle is obvious. Or perhaps the guides should wear a shirt or jacket that says \u201cCape Convoy\u201d in large letters. Also, in fairness I should say that Rob, the owner of Cape Convoy, did try to contact us by text when Rene apparently couldn\u2019t spot us at the meetup. Our cell phones, however, did not provide us cell access in South Africa, so Rob\u2019s attempt did not work. Next time we go to South Africa we will make some sort of cell arrangement so that we have a working phone.Our second Cape Convoy tour, the Winelands tour, was scheduled for the next day. Rene told us, however, that because we were the only two who had booked the Winelands tour for that day, Cape Convoy had moved us to African Eagle, another tour operator. Our experience on the African Eagle wine tour was fine. Rob offered to provide us a partial refund because the African Eagle tour was a bit less expensive than the tour we booked directly through Cape Convoy but, as of the date of this review (fourteen days later), our credit card has still not been credited with the refund."

We did the trek from Cape of Good Hope to Cape Point which takes about 30 to 45 minutes and is well worth the effort as there are some stunning views that you would not see if you went up via the road. Booking was simple and straight forward, we booked whilst still in the UK ahead of our trip. Rob was very responsive and checked in with us the day before the trip once we were in Cape Town.

When we did get to Cape Point, the weather was flawless and we got all of the pictures and experiences we came for. Rob even made sure we saw an Ostrich or two and that the pesky baboons didn't get into our van (with a close call of course). The way back through Chapman's Peak was stunning and it was great to get to see the other areas of Cape Town we hadn't been to yet like Hout's Bay and Camp's Bay.

We started on time and was dropped off at the time they promised they would have me back at the pick up area. Rene has a skilled talent for this job and she exceeded my expectations for this tour! I am so glad I booked with Cape Convoy tours! Well worth the time and price!"

I found Cape Convoy during my search for a tour guide for a Cape Point tour, and had great reviews. Rob definitely knows his stuff! He's very knowledgeable, and knows just how to maximize your time on the tour. I loved the small tour size, which allowed us to really enjoy the time with the other members of our tour. If you find yourself planning a visit to the beautiful Cape Town area, definitely check out Cape Convoy. A great day to be had. And you will not be disappointed!"

I had no problem booking a tour before I arrived in Africa. I got information on who would be the guide, confirmation of the time and meeting place. All went smoothly. I was completely satisfied with the experience of the guide, the response of the guide to my interests and time. I wanted to go down the peninsula, see Table Mountain if open, anything else to appreciate Cape Town and the area in one day. It was a fantastic day."

My husband and I did the Peninsula Day Tour (Cape Point, Boulder's Beach) on our first full day in Cape Town for our honeymoon. Our tour guide was Rene. She was so much fun, has a great sense of humor and is very knowledgeable about Cape Town and each spot we traveled. I appreciated her commentary - whether it was joking around with the guests or providing background on points of interest. She is also an excellent driver! It can be difficult to fight traffic or battle some of the roads in Cape Town - she did it like a champ! We saw so much, it's hard to believe the tour was only a day (8:30 to 4:30). Tips: Do the hike from Cape of Good Hope to the Lighthouse at Cape Point. Stretch the legs a bit and get to see some spectacular views. Views from the Lighthouse are wonderful, but this section of the hike is pretty steep. Be prepared. Currency exchange. We made a quick first stop at a shop for a passenger to exchange some currency. They don't charge any fees or commission. If you can wait to exchange money till you arrive, take advantage of this perk. Charge your cameras the night before! Have fun! And ask lots of questions."

We spent 2 days with Joe the guide who I cannot praise enough. The Cape peninsula tour was a well planned and perfectly timed day. Joe was attentive but at the same time not intrusive and his knowledge of the area and the history of the Cape made a fascinating day. I felt quite sorry for joe on the wine tour day as we were a weary bunch that he picked up from the hotel due to one too many on the waterfront the night before. The day again was well planned. We only did 2 vineyards but that was our choice as we wanted more time in stellanbosch and franschoek. Joe was the perfect guide and he tailor-made both days for us still somehow sticking to the timetable that was agreed. Two very enjoyable and fascinating days. Will definitely be using cape convoy again on our return to the Cape."

Rene explained much about the areas we passed through along the way and was able to answer all of our questions. We then headed out to the Cape of Good Hope and after quite a long drive via Chapmans Peak (fantastic views) we arrived; those who wanted to walk from the lower car park could do so, and those who preferred to be driven to the top stayed in the car. We opted to walk and explored the stunning coastline at our leisure, which was well worth it as the photo opportunities were epic! We walked all the way from the lower car park to the lighthouse at the very top, which took around 1hr 15mins. We then headed for the African penguin colony at Seaforth (Boulders Beach) near Simon's Town and also stopped for a late lunch at the Seaforth restaurant where a few beers and some local fish and chips went down very well! All admission prices to the various parks were included in the tour and overall it was a great day out which really improved our Cape Town experience! Highly recommend this tour to anyone."

Seeing as it was our first day in Cape Town the tour gave us a wonderful oversight as to the geography of the city and we truly felt that we had seen all the major sights from Cape Town to the Cape of Good Hope. We started the tour at the Rhodes Memorial with coffee which set us up for the day. The sun shone when we visited the penguins at Boulders Beach (we had delicious ice-cream bought from a lady selling ice creams in her garden!). Loved the beach huts at Muizenberg, Chapmans Peak Drive and all the other wonderful locations. The trek at the Cape of Good Hope was quite exhilarating as it was a very windy day!

Rob is engaging, passionate, very well informed, and has infectious enthusiasm. We also had lovely company since we were a small group of just nine. Rob got us out of our hotels early so we could beat the tour bus hordes, and it was well worth it \u2013 we even made impromptu stops at the Rhodes Memorial and an ostrich farm. Rob kept the tour relaxed and flexible, while making sure that we got to see everything the stunning Cape Peninsula has to offer. So he\u2019s right, it\u2019s the \u201cbest day tour in the world!\u201d"

This guy knows what he's doing and to get to the Cape Point sign when there's no-one else there is well worth the early alarm call!! All in all a fantastic day!!"

Rob structured the tour brilliantly. We avoided all the queues and crowds. Sure it was an early start (7.30am) but the day flew by.Cape Of Good Hope, Cape Point lighthouse, Boulders Beach, Simons Town, Chapmans Peak Drive, they are all covered on this tour. Rob even booked us a table for lunch in Simons Town.The group was small. Eight people in total. None of that coach party nonsense.If you are in Cape Town (and if you haven't been then I suggest you should) I cannot recommend Rob and Cape Convoy tours highly enough.A brilliant, unforgettable day."

We went on December 23rd, and while Rob's highly recommended start time of 7:30 was early for us, it was totally worth it in order to avoid the holiday crowds at all of the popular spots. We had perfect weather for the day, and were able to see all the main sites including Boulders Beach, Cape Point, Chapman's Peak drive, etc. He also arranged a lovely lunch spot for us in Simons Town. He knew all of the spots to hit, took some great photos for us, and we always managed to leave the sites right when the lines of cars and people trying to get in would build up. Thanks Rob for a wonderful day touring the beautiful cape peninsula!"

My best friend and I spent a day with Rob and company in early December, 2015, on his day tour of the Cape, and I have to say, his ability to pull up points of interest, tell stories, make us laugh, and provide a laid-back day all combined to make this one of the best tours I've been on. I suggest getting in on this action--it's a great way to spend a day and see the famous sign at the Cape of Good Hope, do some hiking on Cape Point, and wave to the penguins...he also gives you a chance to have a leisurely lunch (fish and chips!), and make it back to the city with plenty of time to nap, have a drink, and make it out for dinner. I will recommend Rob to anyone I know going to Cape Town. Enjoy your trip!"

This private excursion with Cape Convoy was one of my most looked forward to tour, and also my most worried tour.I look forward to this because I want to be the Southern point of Africa continent. \u00a0The most worried because this tour is a full day tour, 8-9 hours, and we are required to be back to the ship by 3pm for departure immigration procedures. \u00a0To enjoy this tour fully, one needs 8 hours or more. No one really wants to tour all day while worrying about missing the ship.I was ready to cancel the tour, because of this anxiety. \u00a0I figure we will meet the tour guide, and decide.I am glad I did!Robert, of Cape Convoy was sick and in bed. \u00a0He has his trusted colleague, Joe, to help him out. \u00a0After talking to Joe, I immediately felt comforted, and relaxed. \u00a0My group felt the same. \u00a0My husband, my mom, and friend, Charlene. \u00a0We knew we did not have to cancel this much-anticipated excursion. \u00a0I felt we were in good hands. \u00a0Joe was very understanding, and he assured us we would not have any problem being back in time, especially when we start at 7:30am. \u00a0(He had been hanging around since 7am)Joe was informative, patient, and responsive to our inquisitive personalities. \u00a0He answered all our questions. \u00a0He provided lots of information, and his perspectives, without being \"political\".His vehicle was spacious 7-seater Benz vehicle. \u00a0Comfortable and very clean. \u00a0It is a vehicle easy to get off and onto. \u00a0My mom, with arthritis knee, was able to get on and off with no problem.I like to mention a few incidents to illustrate Joe's attention to details and how he has our best interest at heart:The first and foremost was to assure us we will be back on time. \u00a0And he reconfirmed along the way. \u00a0He knew the order of the attractions, for our benefit. \u00a0We reached all the prime locations ahead of big crowds. \u00a0We had the penguin conservation, all to ourselves. \u00a0No problem taking pictures, and or videos. \u00a0No other tourist in the way. \u00a0Cape Point, My main focus. \u00a0and the momentous picture. \u00a0He took the time to take pictures of just us, despite of other tourists zooming in on him, all wanted to have pictures taken behind the famous marker signage. \u00a0He kindly asked others to wait for him to finish taking a few pictures of us. \u00a0\u00a0As a result, we had wonderful pictures. \u00a0And amazing memory.\u00a0As mentioned, along the way, he kept us abreast of our next stops and our timing. \u00a0\"We are making good time. \u00a0Ahead of schedule.\" \u00a0He plans his route and the timing of his stops, by gagging our status and our feelings. \u00a0He promised we should be back to the terminal by 1pm. \u00a0That worked for us better than anticipated.Our safety. \u00a0There was a section of coastal drive where the tour usually includes. \u00a0Because of recent fire of hundreds of homes in shacks, and resulting unrest in a neighborhood, he did not feel it was safe driving through that section of the tour. \u00a0Also, at a stop, my mom did not want to get off the vehicle, he then stayed with mom, and the vehicle, while the rest of us roam around to capture the magnificent scenery. \u00a0He not only made us feel very safe, but also was vigilant in keeping us safe.We were back in the city before 1pm, he asked again if we want to go for lunch, or somewhere else, since we still have time. \u00a0He is paid the same amount regardless, and yet, he made us feel our interest is more important. \u00a0We opted to go back to the ship. \u00a0He obliged. \u00a0At the end of our 6 hour tour, we felt we are old friends. He genuinely love us to come back and visit Cape Town!In summary, I could not imagine the precious experience without Joe. Imagine what we would have missed had we chose to cancel this tour! \u00a0Thanks to Joe, my family and I are grateful we got to experience the best of South Africa, and the making of lasting memories.If you are looking for a local \"friend\" whom you trust to show you the best of South Africa, I highly recommend Cape Convoy, and ask for Joe Worship. \u00a0You are ensured that He has your best interest at heart! \u00a0We are so glad we did!I also recommend to really enjoy the tour, choose to do this tour when there was no time pressure. \u00a0"

For our Winelands tour, he picked us up on time, chose wineries based on our preference for red or white wine. When Ernie Els Winery was closed for a private function, he quickly chose another great one, Rust en Vrede. We visited three excellent wineries, Rust en Vrede, Waterford Estates, and Anthonij Ruppert\u2014all very different and charming. We could enjoy the wine tastings without worrying about finding the wineries or driving after tasting the various wines. Ebrahim made lunch reservations for us at a lovely restaurant, French Connection Bistro, in Franschhoek. We weren\u2019t rushed at any of our stops and were picked up at a cruise ship and dropped off at our boutique hotel.The second tour was Cape Point tour with Ebrahim arriving at our hotel on time, reviewing our request for places to visit, and customizing our tour to include Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. He wisely recommended that we take a shuttle car (golf cart) tour on a very hot afternoon (95 degrees F) through a hilly landscape at the garden. Ebrahim took us to Chapman\u2019s, Bantry, Camp\u2019s, and Hout Bays, along with Boulders Beach National Park to see the penguins, Simon\u2019s Town, Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope. He made every effort to time the visits to minimize the number of large buses at these various venues. Ebrahim scheduled all of our stops within our time frame and made sure we arrived at the airport on time.Private tours are great, because you can work with your guide to customize the itinerary. You are part of a small group with family and/or friends, not on a large, overcrowded bus. We were impressed with Ebrahim\u2019s knowledge of the destinations, ability to plan various site stops to avoid large crowds, and maximize our enjoyment of the tour."

I recently had the pleasure of joining Cape Convoy on a day-tour along the Cape peninsula with Rob himself at the steering wheel. We were a small group of mixed nationalities (Hungary, Turkey, England, Spain and Denmark) in different ages and Rob knew from experience how to plan the day so that we got the best weather (very changeable locally during the course of the day) and avoided the larger groups to some extent, arriving in busloads. We had adequate time for our stops and walks and Rob was very knowledgeable and gave us a good understanding of South Africa before and now as we were driving along . When it comes to a fun and well-guided tour, it all depends on the guide. No matter which age - as long as you are young at heart and can do a bit of walking - you will have a fantastic day and a unique experience for lifetime. The Cape peninsula is simply stunning and one of South Africa's many gems."

The penguins were adorable (they had baby penguins too!!) and the views mesmerizing from Cape Point and through the whole day.

What really made the tour stand out was Rob though, we'd just flown in the night before and had barely any sleep after a 40 hour travel day yet he managed to keep us awake and entertained lol. I know I'm repeating what hundreds of others have said but it's true he's phenomenal; interesting, funny, well rounded just fantastic."

            "review": "BEST TOUR EVER!. I booked my tour because of the awesome reviews and am sooooo glad I did!!!! THIS IS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE!! My husband and I went on the Cape tour. I have been on many tours and this was by far the best. Rob is so funny, warm, accommodating, and genuine. He works very hard to give every person a fantastic experience. His ability to get people to talk together creates a wonderful experience. He knows the area so well and is able to give you the best experience possible for whatever day you are visiting. There are A LOT of amazing things to see in one day, but Rob manages to get you to all of them. And somehow manages to do this without making anyone feel rushed and allowing for some extra time when someone is especially interested (or a family of ostriches with their chicks happen by).Can I mention that this tour was less than the \"discounted\" tour provided by my package? I think it was a bargain for twice the price - honestly! I laughed all day, and Rob somehow managed to help all these strangers make a connection.Thanks Rob, if my husband and I weren't clear enough. You brought us memories for a lifetime. Oh yes, book early, I was lucky enough to get in on a last minute basis, but I would book way in advance in the future so as to not miss out on the fun."

After reading the reviews on the internet of Cape Convoy Tours, I contacted Rob and booked two tours with him, the Cape Point Tour and Winelands Tours. Rob was our tour guide for the Cape Point Tour and Joe took us to the Winelands. Both I must say were fantastic! Rob is an outgoing, fun loving person who will make your tour memorable. He is very knowledgable about the area, politics and the people of South Africa. After collecting us at our hotel we proceeded to Cape Point, to miss the tour buses and mass of tourists. We were fortunate to see baboons, an ostrich, and penguins during the day. The weather was beautiful and we were able to get out of the car for photo ops of the breath taking coastline. It was a fun, action packed day and one that I will always remember!"

I was in no doubt as to what the plans were. Rob kept me informed as to the timings and who would be conducting the tour. Bianca was our guide for the day. Lovely girl who arrived punctually and was a fountain of knowledge thoughout the tour. The day was filled with numerous different things to see and experience but conducted in a very relaxed way. We didn't feel rushed. The small group experience was just what we wanted. Great job guys. If any readers are considering a trip this company is a must do."

Infact after watching his video on his website i was looking forward to it. By God he did not disappoint. He met us on time in our hotel reception from the second we met him it was like seeing a long lost friend. The day was a misrable day in August and after the other family had cancelled he asked us if we still wanted to go because of the weather we still went. I cant tell you how cold it was so wrap up warm for this trip. He even lent my mum a beanie it was that cold. He is full of knowledge and humour i didnt want the day to end. My word of advice is if you dont want to have a laugh as well as being informed then book with someone else. At the Cape of good hope he made sure we beat the rush of bus loads of tourist's to ensure we got a photo (the one everyone wants). It was worth the money and he tailor makes the tour to suit everyone. Thank you so much for a great day out Rob your an amazing guy.Emma and Liz from Cheshire."

I took my parents to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary and one of the things my mom wanted to see we're the Penguins, one of her favorite animals. I booked the Cape Point day tour and after a couple of emails, we were all set to enjoy the tour a week later.I didn't have a mobile number while in Cape Town, but had mobile wifi access to easily check email and know we would be picked up late near our property rental.Follow the majority of the advice and take a fun tour that feels like you're hanging out with one of your mates down at the pub and listen to him give his view on the many changes going on in South Africa as you enjoy the scenery. I definitely learned a lot and got an insight on his view of the history and social psyche in the country.Our tour took us above to get a beautiful aerial view of Muizenberg Beach. Next we passed through Kalk Bay and learned a bit of history that it was initially settled by Filipinos who also built small Catholic churches before they left. The many highlights of our tour included: the Jackass Penguin colony at Boulder\u2019s Beach, the hike up to Cape Point, the picture ops at Cape of Good Hope, an interesting meeting with 2 male and 2 female ostriches, and the many scenic and picturesque stops along the way.Heed the advice of fellow TripAdvisor members and book a tour with Rob!And yes, Texas is bigger than France!!!"

You can't go wrong with Rob as a tour guide; he's knowledgeable, entertaining and definitely `seeks to please'. We booked the Cape Point Tour with Rob and very much enjoyed the day. Rob was very conscious of planning the tour around the weather to get the best out of the excursion, which was always going to be difficult on a SA winter's day. His execution was perfect ensuring we arrived at The Cape when the sun was at its brightest and the sky virtually cloud-free. On route we stopped at a number of Rob's suggested viewing points, all of which contributed to some great photo opportunities. Rob has hints and tips for everything such as how to navigate the Cape of Good Hope sign in and out like a military operation avoiding the `coach crowds', the best route to see the penguins and their chicks, good photo spots, nice locations for coffee breaks, etc. Throughout the trip he kept us entertained with trivia, anecdotes, stories of his upbringing (providing an interesting understanding of Afrikaan culture), jokes and much more; my wife and daughter had the giggles throughout the day! Due to serious roadworks Rob had to forgo an element of the tour but he not only graciously offered to reimburse us for the change in itinerary (which I was more than happy to give back as a tip) but went out of his way to make-up for something that was clearly out of his control. This truly demonstrated Rob's commitment to customer service and it's not difficult to see why Rob gets such good reviews. Rob was originally from the UK and I wasn't sure his humor would translate with the other 5 USA guests on the tour but they absolutely warmed to him demonstrating his international appeal. He mentioned that later in life he completed a history degree and his knowledge of the spots we visited was clearly evident; he's a walking history book and you won't be disappointed. He also plays to his audience and works hard to ensure he treats everyone with respect, courtesy and friendliness. I don't think you can go wrong with Rob and suggest you book him early. Rob gets the thumbs up from us! Thanks for a great day Rob, all the best if you are reading this - Sally, Dave & Jessica."

About 2 weeks before our tour, we received an email inquiring if we could move our day. We had a pretty tight schedule, but were able to switch our Monday and Wednesday tours around. Rob took care of everything to allow a smooth transition. He even got our Robben Island tickets exchanged, which I\u2019m sure was no easy task.Rob arrived a bit early to start our Cape Point tour on a rainy day. However, he kept a positive attitude about the rain. He planned to alter our day as we went along, dependent on the weather. Obviously, Rob has done this trip many times and is quite familiar with the changing patterns. On the way to Cape Point, he informed us about the city and of course added in some humor as well as his outlook on life and society \u2013 which we totally enjoyed. Rob is a ball of energy! We saw some beautiful sites like St. James Bay and several other beaches. We had a break in the storm at the appropriate time, so he took us to see the penguins at Boulders beach first, which were adorable. Since it was so cold, he lent my mom his beanie!By then, it had started clearing up just like Rob predicted, so we headed off to Cape Point. Rob wanted us to get our funicular tickets before the tour buses arrived to save time \u2013 which we did. He told us where to go and what we might want to see and waited in the parking lot for us to return at our leisure. We were able to enjoy Cape Point\u2019s amazing views with little rain.Next, Rob took us to the Cape of Good Hope. It was a little crowded but we managed to get a good picture with the sign despite the tour buses there. Rob then drove us to a more secluded area where we could enjoy the ocean. He waited in the van while we explored on our own.On the way to lunch, Rob stopped at a roadside stand for my dad to purchase a painted ostrich egg. Rob stayed with us while we negotiated a price to make certain we both reached a fair deal. While we were having lunch at Bertha\u2019s in Simon\u2019s Town, Rob received good news that the previously closed Chapman\u2019s Peak drive was now open. We all really enjoyed this scenic drive, and Rob kept us entertained the whole way! We drove through Camp\u2019s Bay on the way back to our B & B. It seemed a little rushed when we were dropped off, but we covered everything on our itinerary. The bad news is my dad forgot to get a family picture with Rob. Even though we didn\u2019t get our picture, the tour memories will last a lifetime. Our day with Rob was filled with laughs and great sightseeing. His bubbly personality makes his tours unique and unforgettable."

I booked Rob/Cape Convoy Tours to take myself, and a team of teenage girls, on a Cape Point Day Tour, on the final full day of our visit to South Africa.Alas, the day turned out to be rainy, windy and miserable. Rob called early in the morning and offered to let us cancel our tour and get a refund. But we said that -- as it was our final day in South Africa, and as the girls had been taking part in a sporting competition all week -- we really wanted to get out of our hotel and see what we could see.So we set off, with a plan to turn back to Cape Town if it looked like we wouldn't be able to see anything at Cape Point. Fortunately, between rain showers, we managed to take in the major attractions: the jackass penguins, climbing to the Cape Point lighthouse, watching some ostriches carouse on the beach and getting our photo taken at Cape of Good Hope sign.During the drive, Rob gave us some interesting perspectives on sport and culture in South Africa. He pointed out to us people whose professions it was to watch out for sharks, and baboons, respectively (who would have thought?) And at each stop Rob let us take as long or as little time as we wished. Then, because we didn't linger very long at any of the sites, and got back to Cape Town early, Rob very generously said that he'd refund a part of what we had paid for the tour since it turned out to be less than a full day.I can't imagine that we would have experienced nearly so much flexibility, and goodwill, from too many other tour operators! Thank you for a memorable day Rob."

After a lot of research I reached out to Cape Convoy for the booking, Rob was very responsive throughout the process.We just arrived back from our tour today including cape point, cape of good hope, simons town and penguins wrapping up with a fantastic stop at a winery overlooking the ocean. The entire day was amazing, Rob was filled with great knowledge and facts our group laughed the entire day. We spent the entire day driving around with Rob learned a ton of information about Cape Town and South Africa. Rob's passion for his work, and passion for South Africa made this a truly amazing experience. I can't recommend this tour enough for an outstanding and informative day in Cape Town."

The sights are amazing and Rob couldn't be more fun, entertaining and informative. Many posters in the Cape Town forum suggested renting a car to do the Cape Point day, but I'm SO glad we let Rob do the driving - and it was like having a really smart/informed best friend taking us around. He was wonderful with the kids and kept the pace of the tour just right. Plus his passion, information and history of Cape Town really added to our day. The views, darling little towns and all the animals (penguins!) made this one of our all-time favorite vacation days. We also arranged a private day tour of the wine region with Cape Convoy and Rob chose an amazing guide/driver for us - I'm terrible with names and don't remember, but this was also a wonderful day. The wineries were chosen with the kids in mind and my girls (10 years old) had a fine time too. Couldn't recommend Rob and Cape Convoy more highly."

And, lucky for us, being low season we were his only guest, so it was essentially a private tour! We had a great time with him. My sister asked about kelp - and the next thing we know he is picking up kelp, stabbing it open with his keys, and showing her the inside. My sister claimed she saw a baboon on an ostrich while we were driving, and he turned around to go investigate. (It wasn't, but we all had a great laugh). Rob is loads of fun.

I would imagine most are good so the basis of choosing this operator was the ratings. There were a lot of 5 star ratings........so much so that one would think the ratings were stacked. NO WAY!Rob is that good........He is entertaining, knowledgeable and, at times to my liking, irreverent. This makes for an enjoyable day if like any of these qualities. The tour is packed with sightseeing including Penguins, the Cape, stops in small seaside towns and spectacular views. He will stop anywhere for a quick photo opportunity, champions the plight of penguins crossing the road and keeps everything light.One quality that doesn't get a lot of attention is trust. I signed up the day before thinking he would not be able to take me. Not only did he \"fit me and my wife in\" , he asked for no credit card information or any other form of payment. I was thinking he would ask for that prior to starting the tour. No, he did not ask for anything. I had to eventually ask him how to pay at the end of the tour and he said no problem......just give me a credit card number. I can hear the readers now.......shaking in disbelieve that I would do something so stupid.....but trust works both ways. I could give him a false card number; he could charge anything he likes and pass the number over to his buddies. NO.....it was all above board and professional. This is the type of ethics we need and I had to go to South Africa to get it.All I can say is that the total experience was outstanding...Rob, the sights, the knowledge I gained etc, etc,.....By the way, I am an Auditor so trust can be hard to experience!!!!"

Rob called first thing to let us know when he would be arriving, which was a nice touch. I was a little nervous about the lack of an itinerary to begin with, but soon realised that this is how the tour works and means that you get the most from the day. There was virtually no waiting, and we saw everything that we wanted and more than we expected. Rob knows his stuff, his history lessons were brilliant and it was great to feel as though you were learning whilst admiring the scenery.Firstly, we went to Hout Bay along some beautiful roads and met 'Blitz' and his pet seal. As Rob is friendly with Blitz, this was an amazing photo opportunity (and Blitz may let you feed his seal). We visited Simons Town and had a look round and a drink, it's very pretty but there is more to do else where. The penguins are amazing at boulder's beach - we had plenty of time to see lots and take some amazing photos. Cape point was amazing, we had an hour and a half to grab lunch and have a look around. Two Oceans seems a very nice restaurant, but the grab-and-go option is better if you want to see everything. You can still have a beer and drink it as you wait for your fresh pizzas to be cooked. The views were out of this world, and we saw an eland and baboons. We got perfect pictures with The Cape of Good Hope sign, and lots of others - Rob is an amazing photographer and knows exactly where to take them. We popped into the Ostrich farm (another hot topic for Rob). All in all, this was an amazing day, I don't think it would have been as amazing with any other guide. Choose Cape Convoy :)"

We always had sufficient time to walk around, shop (only if we wanted) and get a snack. I never felt rushed or even felt like I was on an organized tour.

However, he had one of his cohorts, Ebrahim, take his place. It worked out just fine. Ebrahim was both knowledgeable and eager to make our two days enjoyable. He is very proud of his country and it showed in his attitude. Our first day was spent working our way around the Cape Peninsula on the Cape Convoy Cape Peninsula Tour. We were just my wife and myself, but we knew that there would be others in the vehicle. Our companions for the day were a group of five young Italian and Nigerian oil geologists and technicians on vacation from Angola. Ebrahim met us on time and we got a good start. We managed to visit all of the places that Rob had originally listed in his packaged itinerary and it was a very full day. The only off-note was that as a twosome together with a fivesome, it became clear early on that we would be outvoted with respect to the rhythm of the tour. Near the end of the day we found that included was a winery tour and tasting that was not on the original agenda and, from our point of view, we could have done without that. We were there to see the culture, not to party. That had also been an issue at lunch which became a two-hour feast/festival \u2013 for them. We left some money for our share and left early to walk around the town of Simonstown for a little while. We have had many other tours where we met new people and when it is other couples or threesomes, it is easier for the tour to be a little more democratic in how some issues are resolved. Having said that, however, we do not fault Cape Convoy or Rob or Ebrahim for our slight discomfort. It was what it was and we did not regret taking the tour for one minute.Our second day was a wine tour \u2013 the Cape Convey Winelands Tour. We were really hoping to get to some smaller, boutique wineries \u2013 based on our past experiences in other wine regions. However, in South Africa it seems that they do things a little differently. The wineries that invite tastings have sunk a lot of money into the grounds and tasting rooms, so they tend to be larger wineries rather than boutiques. Rob had us set up for three wineries \u2013 two in the morning and one after lunch. Our companions the second day were a very nice young couple from Brazil and we got along just fine all day.The three wineries were all very nice. Our first stop, at the Ernie Els Winery (yes, that Ernie Els \u2013 the golf professional), was the highlight of the day. The other two wineries were just as beautiful, but we much preferred the Els property as the standout. Our second stop was the Waterford Estate Winery. For lunch, Ebrahim had us at a lovely sidewalk caf\u00e9 in Franschhoek. After lunch we stopped at the LaMotte Winery.Our bottom line on Cape Convoy is simple \u2013 they deliver what they promise.

Rob is hysterical and so friendly! We were with 2 other young couples from Englad (one of whom had just gotten engaged) and an older gentleman making it 7 people total on our tour. Rob is so social and outgoing that we truly all became friends throughout the day and had a phenomenal time. My husband and I choose Cape Convoy because we didnt want to be stuck in some huge tour bus with 50 other people and i am SO GLAD we did! Rob brought us around to all the sites, and did it in such a way that we hit virtually no lines the entire day! We would just pull up, hike around, take a bunch of pictures, have a great time and then just as we would be leaving like 20 tour buses would pull up and wait times would double. Rob really knows his way around and makes an effort to have you truly see and experience places instead of waiting in lines or sitting in traffic. He is also incredibly knowledgeable about South Africa, everything from history to plants/animals to current events; you can ask him anything and he will be able to answer it. It was the best day ever and I wouldnt trade it for anything. Honestly I would pay double what his tour costs it was that amazing!!! Thank you Rob!!!"

Rob was a blast to hang out with and did a great job of giving us tips to avoid the busloads of tourists and take some stunning photos. Even better was the history lesson of the area as the various world explorers sailed around the region. As an added bonus, he gave us great advice in visiting Table Mountain - if the conditions are right just go, you can't plan it due to wind and clouds. At the end of our tour, he highly recommended we take the opportunity and dropped us off at the cable lift so that we could cap off our day with some amazing sights. You won't regret hiring Rob."

We had an amazing time with Rob as our tour guide, he did not let us down.Rob made excellent choices of hotels and we would be very happy stay in these hotels on our next trip to South Africa. Rob is not a foodie but did recommend some great places for food although we were disappointed with 34 degrees south in Kynsa. However, this is not Rob's fault. He did say it was best for fish and we ordered meat dishes, so if you go there stick to fish! Would recommend JJ's for food though, we had a great meal there!As per other reviews, Rob is a very friendly tour guide and always has plenty of information at hand. There was hardly a quiet moment on our tour which helped pass the time when traveling for long periods of time.This tour was amazing and Rob will gladly accommodate anything that you wish to see or do. Our trip to South Africa was very special and Rob was part of this. Thanks Rob, you were awesome!"

As soon as I saw Rob's videos and read other reviews, I knew it was a no-brainer to book his Cape Peninsula Tour during my recent trip to South Africa. Everything you read about Rob is true. He's hilarious, entertaining, informative...and you immediately feel like you've been buddies for years. He picked up my friend and I around 8:45am for a full-day tour of the Cape Peninsula. As it turned out, there was only one other person on the bus that day, a woman from Canada, so it felt like our own private tour! The three of us got along great so each stop we made, we explored together. We headed toward Muizenberg first and made a clockwise tour of the Cape. There were a handful of stops to take great photos of the coast or explore places like Simon's Town, but of course the majority of time was reserved for Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope. Rob gave us plenty of time to hike all the way out to the lighthouse at Cape Point, and it was great being able to wander off on our own so we didn't feel like we had to ask every time we wanted to stop for ANOTHER selfie ;). We then headed to the Cape of Good Hope (I finally learned that they are in fact two different spots!). We saw some HUGE ostriches and a bunch of baboons along the side of the road, and Rob pulled over so we could get a closer look and take more pics. I got some pretty funny selfies with one ostrich who came RIGHT up to my window! Rob was also an awesome amateur photographer and got some great shots for us at the touristy Cape of Good Hope sign (there is often a long line here but we got pretty lucky on timing and Rob was like a movie director getting people to move along so we got our pics...he could make a living doing that alone!) The last part of the trip was along the stunning Chapman's Peak Drive, past Hout Bay, and just the most beautiful natural scenery I could imagine. Honestly, the scenery throughout the whole trip was breathtaking, and Rob knew so much about the area and the history, so we were able to learn and not just take pictures! The only negative of the day was having to leave when Rob dropped us off. He's definitely the kind of guy that you'll want to have beers with by the end of the day. I feel bad for anyone who isn't able to do this tour with Rob. It's THAT good. I just hope I can get back to South Africa someday so I can look him up and finally grab those beers :)~Katie"

She and Rob exchanged a few emails and we could both tell from that point it was going to be a great time. When Rob picked us up from the hotel we found out there were only going to be 3 of us (4 including Rob) on the tour. Literally a private tour! From the start, Rob was top notch. He had an awesome and engaging personality. Since we chose the full day, he had a route planned that avoided the crowds (where possible) and it allowed us to spend more than enough time at each spot. In addition Rob takes charge when needed. Trust me, you will need it at the Cape of Good Hope. We ran into a bit of an issue with everyone taking pictures in front of the sign and basically Rob gave us the low down and we had out photos within 5 min vs dealing with the chaotic tourists and tour buses. His inside knowledge on what to do and where to go makes the tour a lot more enjoyable and really helps to optimize your time while never feeling rushed. In addition, throughout the tour Rob provides the history of the area. He doesn't just drive you from spot to spot but teaches you the history so you can truly enjoy your time. Plus it never hurts to have a guy that knows exactly the right angle to take the photo to incorporate the whole shot and have an awesome memory.  If you like to just sit, not talk and be a bump on a log.....I would suggest you rent a movie about Cape Town. But if you want to have a fully interactive tour, then Cape Convoy is your answer. You will laugh and cry (from laughing....not the sad crying) and know that you took full advantage of your time in Cape Town. I literally could go on for hours about our tour but that would just spoil it for you! Now go and book it! Awesome job Rob, you have a great business!! We had a blast and the rest of our trip was amazing thanks to a few of your insider tips! Best,Alex (Chicago)"

I know it's been about a year since I went to Cape Town but I'd have to argue that makes this review so much more pertinent that I've remembered the time I spent with Rob and Cape Convoy after all this time as one of the best trips I've taken in all my travels.So, like anyone on holiday, I'm not fond of guided tours, even if they are personalized ones. And after two days of boring hop-on, hop-off buses, another two days of a guided tour was the last thing I wanted. But my sister had booked this, not least because she'd been told that it wasn't safe for three women to wander around the outskirts of Cape Town alone.Rob took us to see The Cape of Good Hope on one day and wine country including Franschhoek (\"French Corner\" - one of the oldest towns of the Republic of South Africa situated about 75 kilometres from Cape Town) and Stellenbosch as well as some wine yards the next day.Now, picture, if you will, three bored, irritated women with induvidual copies of Lonely Planet etc in their hands getting into the van. Picture, two hours later, exhilarated folks getting pictures clicked with ostriches in the background as they return from the final point in the African Continent. Rob is an excellent guide. He's a good driver and knowledgable. He's a motor mouth who can keep you entertained constantly. But, far more importantly, he also has the ability to see what the customer wants and find it for them. And he's unobtrusive and low key, even when we're moving behind schedule."

If there's another guide for this area who who knows more love to meet them. (I doubt it though) He got to the Cape in front of the buses, found a great spot for lunch and could modify the day anyway we needed to. We four so enjoyed our time with him. I'm sure you will be too."

So you get a tour and commentary that reflect this which makes it very enjoyable. As well as being clever and well-informed, Rob is a lot of fun. So it is a great way to see amazing things and have a stress-free experience. I would certainly do another Rob tour next time."

First day exploring the Cape Peninsula..... and you will get to the Cape of Good Hope before the tour buses for that all important photo! The 2nd day we fitted in the Botanical Gardens, a Cheetah encounter and wine tasting, without feeling rushed. Rob has a wealth of knowledge and humour which all add to the day. Thanks Rob for a great time and I'm sure you'll get some mileage out of the \"Cheetah\" story !!"

Chapman's Peak was my favorite as the view from the tip is gorgeous! Don't waste your time looking further, many companies do the same tour but there is only one Rob. Cheers!"

It is clear that Rob is super passionate about what he does and that passion is definitely infectious. I highly recommend that anyone who visits Cape Town takes a tour with Cape Convoy- you will see/do so much without feeling rushed. Thanks for everything Rob!! We will be sure to tell our all friends/family in NY/NJ about our amazing time with you. I will also be sure to send you the heart photo we took at the bottom of Cape Point as soon as I upload it!!Hope you visit us in the US soon!!!"

I was about to catch my flight early morning at 7 am from Nairobi to Cape Town via JoBurg, I had only one free day, the next day, I wrote an email thinking this will never happen, just before taking my flight Rob responds with all the details and we're busy emailing to get the timings and him finding the best possible way to accommodate me, he was brilliant! I still hadn't decided due to my travel dates and mailed him at 11pm the night before the tour, he responds and confirms he has a spot for me, again, he was brilliant! NO BODY DOES THAT THESE DAYS! The next day he picks me from the hotel and we're on our way! The other guys in the group were returning customers, always a good sign! He was very friendly, very informative and FUN! (That's a note to the reviewer who said Rob wasn't funny) He was brilliant with the planning and we saw each and every point of the \"Cape Point Tour and Winelands tour all in one day\" even if you don't drink he accommodated me and made me feel very comfortable, coz he didn't drink either, but it was very insightful and educational to learn wine making and we both learnt something new :) The penguins tour was amazing, Long Beach is just breathtaking and Camp's Bay as well not forgetting the Cape of Good Hope and we also saw some Ostriches and spotted a few Whales as well! He didn't leave a single stone untouched. I would definitely recommend him to anyone anytime and when I return to CPT would definitely hook up with Rob the man again!Thank you Rob for an amazing tour and company! Say hi to Victor!"

Not only is Rob ridiculously fun and hilarious, he knows so much about the history and people of Cape Town. When you book with Cape Convoy you should know a few things. 1. Rob is hilarious and will have you laughing by 8:45 am. The man could moonlight as a standup comedian. He is your cup of coffee that day. 2. Rob will share so much history with you in your time with him. The history of buildings, the rock and mountain formations, the people... he knows so much and he shares it with you in a way that makes it easy to retain. I actually felt like my brain grew on the tour. 3. Rob is just a genuinely good person. The type of guy that makes you happy to be around. The type of guy who makes you question why you get so stressed out back at home with work and the day to day. I think this tour is an absolute must. This is for anyone who really wants to have a fun day, but also a day where you can learn about a different place on this planet and reflect on your place in it. I know I will always remember this tour whenever i catch myself getting stressed and try to get through it half as cool as Rob does. Could not recommend enough. Just book it and thank Rob later!"

He responded quickly and told me he only had 2 spaces left for the date I had requested, so I booked the tour and received confirmation. Fast forward, two months; we were greeted by our guide for Cape Convoy Tours, but it was not Rob. The guide we had was very good and very knowledgeable and I did enjoy the tour but I am disappointed that I did not get the tour with Rob as I had expected. Because I was told there were only 2 spaces left, I'm left a little bothered thinking, 1) it was a case of bait and switch or 2) we were bumped for some reason. Regardless, it came as quite a surprise and prior notice, at the very least, would have been appreciated. I am not angry and understand that Cape Convoy did supply the service for which it was contracted to do, but I wish it was handled differently and am left wondering about the tour I would have had otherwise..."

We awoke to the darkest low hanging clouds ever, it looked like a downpour was imminent. If I was self driving, I would have cancelled our plans and even considered cancelling out of the tour. Rob showed up (on time) and assured us we would have a great time. There was a total of 7 of us. Rob first took us to a seaside town (Muizenberg) with colorful houses on the beach, where we made a coffee stop. By the town we arrived at the picturesque Simon's town, the sun was shining. Next at Boulder's, we spent a good mount of time observing the penguins from both lookout points. Next, at Cape Point, we had lunch, took the funicular up, walked around (saw whales) and hiked down. This was the highlight of our trip and we spend a lot of time her and were not rushed. Then on to the Cape of Good Hope (of course photos @ the sign). We drove along the breath taking Chapman's Peak and the beach towns on ur way home.Rob was the best host ever. He was very engaging, funny, full of information and interacted well with everyone. He knows all of the photo stops (and is a good photographer:-). Rob knew how to dodge the weather and the crowds, there is no way I would have been able to do the same. Forget hiring a car, just go with Rob! You will have a better time and none of the hassles of driving (getting lost, parking, petrol, tolls for Chapman's Peak etc.) Also, all of the entry fees (Penguins, Cape Point) are included (except Cape Point funicular R105). We were back at our hotel by 5:10PM to sunny skies.If you enjoy big bus tours with taped commentary, then this is not the tour for you."

We had a lots of questions and each and every question was answered in a friendly way by Rob. It's like you sense that you have a friend in an unknown city. Let me give you some hints about how Rob helped us to arrange for a tour with us.1) We wanted to do the Cape Point Uncovered Tour on a weekend. It was well informed to us by Rob that this tour was a weekday tour, but as soon as we expressed our desires, he arranged it for us. It's like someone is valuing your wishes. You feel special.2) At the time of booking the tour, we were reluctant to give few details of our card, for which it became a problem to book it. No Problem, Rob booked the tour, believe me, WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT, and asked us to pay at the time of the tour itself. I really don't know, how many of the Tour Operators will take such high risk to arrange a tour for you. Something we really appreciate. We got Joe, as our guide and from the moment we were at his car he became a friend, who knows almost everything about Cape Town and it's surrounding. He took individual care of every guests, making all feel great. He took great pictures, cracked jokes with you, took us to really good vineyards and suggested us really good restaurants for lunch. I can't stop praising this group.P.S To all future travelers to Cape Town \" Taking a tour with CAPE CONVOY, is itself an experience of it's own. You need to try it, if you are in the The Mother City\""

Rob\u2019s passion and extensive knowledge of the area made for a perfect day. He was able to navigate the area to avoid the crowds while stopping at some of the most beautiful seascapes anywhere in the world.

I simply can't fault this tour and would recommend it to anyone. Rob is a fun, informal tour guide who is knowledgeable and genuine.While he obviously has some basic itenerary planned on your trip to the Cape of Good Hope, he tailors the tour as required to the crowd and audience. Rob in knowledgeable on a wide range to topics including history and wildlife and will give appropriate commentary as you go along depending on your interests.The tour was informal but intimate and we got to see all we expected and more.Our convoy took us through the suburbs of Cape Town to Simons Town for morning tea with brief stop offs at surfing hot spots to experience the shark warning system and view Table Mountain from the Atlantic Ocean. We took photos at the coloured huts along the beach and enjoyed a lovely pastry and coffee in Simons Town.Next stop was Boulders Beach and the African Penguins. We had a good half an hour to oogle at the cute and curious nature of the penguins on Boulders Beach as they tended to their young and played in the surf.Our tour then snaked along the cliffs of the Atlantic on our way to Cape Point where we stopped on multiple occassions to view Southern Right Whales just a few metres offshore.A postcard photo opportunity and next thing we're at Cape Point. With plenty of time to hike to the most south-western point in South Africa, climb to the lighthouse and enjoy a beautiful lunch at the Two Oceans restaurant and we soon off to tick the box at the Caope of Good Hope sign.On our way we watched two ostrich grazing by the beach. Rob then took us to an stop off with less tourists where we took more photos and watched a family of baboons sit on top of a parked car.Finally we're on our way back to Cape Town via Chapmans Pass which is a cliff edge drive with awesome views of Table Mountain and the coastline. A stop at the top to admire the view and sadly our tour is nearly over.We had a great day. It was fun, informal, intimate and we felt we got more than our moneys worth. All entrance fees and parking attendants were including in your tour price. The best full day we had in Cape Town. A must do!!"

We took a combined tour of the Cape of Good Hope and the winelands in one day which is also divided into 2 different days; we wanted one day with our limited time. Rob was easy to contact and we had all of our arrangements settled before we even arrived in South Africa. Rob is very personable, knowledgeable about the history of the area, and passionate about being South African. Since we didn't have a lot of extra time, he kept us on a very aggressive but appropriate schedule to avoid tour buses, long lines, and bad traffic. When we would encounter something of interest (an ostrich wandering free at Cape Point or whales breeching off Simons Town), he was always willing to stop and let us enjoy the moment. Capping the day at Ernie Els' winery was a fitting end to a great day!"

If you have limited time in Cape Town and want to hit up the highlights - this is a MUST!My wife Hillary and I spent a wonderful day with Rob. What I liked about this tour is the pace and the size. Because the group size was small, we could move at a pace that kept my interest and didn't rush. It was like spending the day with a group of friends, not a \"just another tour group\". Rob was amazing! He was funny, knowledgable, and just a pleasure to be around.He chose our activities wisely, and ordered everything in a way to maximize our fun and weather. We did the Cape Point tour, and along the way: Hung out with a bunch of penguins by the beach.Walked next to baboons with cute little baby baby baboons holding on. Spotted some zebras, ostriches, and many whales. Hiked the incredibly beautiful Cape Point. Took a panoramic beach view road home, and took pictures at the best lookouts. Had laughs and made memories the entire way. I can't say enough good things about this activity. If you're in Cape Town - do it."

As a party of 6, we were lucky enough to have a private tour and Rob made sure we got to see everything we wanted and more. Along with scheduled stops at Boulder Beach to see the penguins (easily the best part of the day), Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope, we managed to stumble across a family of baboons and a wild ostrich as well as stopping at some brilliant viewing points along the way. Rob ensures there is never a quiet moment on the tour and his knowledge of Cape Town is ridiculous as his stories are hilarious (particularly enjoyed the Russian basketballer one!). I would take this tour again in a heartbeat and if anything, the day came to an end too quickly. Can't thank you enough, Rob!"

We took his Cape Peninsula day tour (my parents, sister and I) and really had a blast.He's super knowledgeable and really loves his job. Friendly, funny and engaging the whole time.I'll add one point to illustrate: we were originally scheduled to go for the tour on a Thursday, but the weather report was rain and, indeed, it ended up raining that day. I emailed Rob on Wednesday and asked if we could reschedule the tour for the following day, when the weather was supposed to improve. He was quite busy with bookings over the next few days but accommodated our request and agreed to take us on Saturday. The day was gorgeous and that played a huge part in us having a fun time; it would have been a lot less enjoyable to see the Cape in the pouring rain and wind.Rob will make sure you have fun.

That alternate day didn't work for us, so we proceeded with the tour as scheduled. Rob's experience leading this tour ensured the day was still a success. With a strategic coffee break during a rain storm, he ensured we arrived at the penguin colony and Cape of Good Hope during a break in the weather. Rob is a \"ball of energy\" and clearly enjoys leading this tour despite having already been to Cape Peninsula countless times. He is very well informed about South Africa's history and politics resulting in some interesting discussions and a lot learned. I walked away from the tour completely happy with my Cape Peninsula experience. I highly recommend going on a tour with Cape Convoy while visiting Cape Town."

My wife and I went to South Africa for the first time and it was our 1st year anniversary.I wanted to do something special and different and looked at many reviews on trip advisor as I am sure you are doing right now :)This tour stuck out like a sore thumb. Now as you all know everyone's experience is different as everyone has different things that make them tick but look at the ratio of good points to bad points here, it says it all really. And my experience was over and above what I thought I would get. Rob Salmon is gem of a human being. Me and my wife did not stop talking about him after our trip and have told all our friends and colleagues about the tour and SA. Going on the cape point tour with Rob is educational / fun and makes you want to never return from your holiday. We learnt a lot of things about SA, saw sights that otherwise weren't of mention in any tour guides, had breathtaking encounters with wildlife and post card pictures and stories to return home with. Rob made everyone on the tour feel welcome and united, our convoy included people from all geographies and we were all catered for and had nothing but smiles and a fantastic experience. Great value for money, great tour of Cape point and many many other sites along the way with stop offs for browsing and food breaks. My wife felt it was the highlight of our trip and I couldn't agree more. We even told people in Mauritius (which was our next destination) to book the tour as they were headed here. Rob, we miss you 'bru' I hope all is well and look forward to seeing you again someday.Btw make sure you take a decent camera because you are about to experience a slice of heaven on earth! If you are thinking of looking at another tour in SA, it's your loss my friend, look at the number of reviews here that make cape convoy tours such a hit, I wish you could have experienced what I did!Fahim & Tam"

If you want to be escorted and entertained by a personality who \"goes against the mainstream\" of your regular tour operator, then Rob is your man. Our Cape Point tour on May 5, sandwiched between a conference at the Westin Capetown, started amidst a miserable cold and wet morning, and there was Rob, smiling and upbeat and graciously asking us if we wanted to reconsider and arrange another date during our stay. We decided to proceed as it was clear Rob would entertain and educate through the entire tour, rain or shine. When the clouds parted at Boulder's Beach we saw the Penguins and when enjoying coffee and Tea at a local restaurant awaiting for a heavy downpour to end, Rob announced that he had a feeling that there would be an opening in the weather to view and enjoy Cape Point, and that is exactly what happened.Rob was extremely informative and as lively and upbeat a tour operator as you will ever meet- he turned a potentially disastrous day into an adventure to be remembered. We highly recommend Rob's tour to anyone who wants to sit back, enjoy the sights and be educated on the history, local sights and politics of S. Africa - the 7 hour tour went by far too quickly !"

We parked close to all attractions, we went to the best place for lunch, he stopped when we wanted to stop, he was very keen to show us as much as possible, even took us to the Rhodes memorial which was not on the tour. Joe has a great knowledge of Cape Town and was happy to honestly answer any questions we had. Then we went on the five day Garden Route Tour with Rob, well this was something very special. Rob made everything exciting, from saving a tortoise in the middle of the road, moving the tour around so we had the very best weather at each location, telling us the best place to eat, even making reservations for us. Add to this non stop discussions about everything, not only him talking to us, but us talking, and expressing our opinions, just like a family road trip. We'll never forget our trip to Cape Town and in particular our adventures with Rob. The best thing you can say about Rob and Cape Convoys is \" they deliver \", what ever they say you will see, you see. ( except Baboons Joe, I don't think they exist !!! )Still Smiling Ron C"

I have been to Cape Point a couple of times before - my husband was a newbie - and we both had a great day out with Rob. He showed me things I've missed on prior trips to Cape Town/Cape Point (Cecil Rhodes Memorial & the \"2nd\" lighthouse at Cape Point) and kept us thoroughly amused and entertained all day long. But to say Rob is just amusing is to undersell his wealth of knowledge about the area, its challenging history and its biodiversity. He is both funny and incredibly bright. And nor can I thank him enough for his lovely lunch recommendation in Simonstown - a 'locals' place for the best fish and chips I can remember. Plus a bottle of wine for USD $8. Plus mushy peas (you can take a girl out of England but\u2026) I'd recommend Rob to anyone looking for a great trip around Cape Point."

Can't recommend this tour more highly to anyone who wants a unique, fun, personal experience of some of the most breathtaking places on the planet. The real joy is that you know from the first moment (like randomly picking up some fellow travellers in the colourful Bo-Kaap) you're not just on some jaded formulaic scripted sightseeing tour. Rob's whole approach is to take the road less travelled (literally and metaphorically) so you wind up at all the superb highlights from Cape Point to Chapman's Peak to even an unexpected spin up to the Rhodes Memorial without another tour bus or queue in sight. Add in some winning Essex charm, fascinating historical ad-libbing, socio-politically incorrect insights (This is South Africa!), a picture postcard lunch location, docile penguins, rude boy baboons, a few feral ostriches and some of the best photo opportunities in the world and you're in for something very special indeed.

We joined Rob for his Cape Peninsula Tour in November.During many years of travelling, we've never taken a guided tour. I suppose we thought it would be boring, a rip-off and ultimately a waste of time and money.We decided to join Rob on his Cape Peninsula tour - based on the fabulous reviews he was getting on Trip Advisor. It was genuinely awesome in every way and fantastic value for money. He says from the outset that he'll do anything he can to fit the day around you and what you'd like to do - and he means it. Just a few of many examples - he'll drop you right outside an attraction where he can't park. Go park the car and run back like an idiot, just so you don't have to walk too far, or wait too long. Rob kept telling us that he'd get us to the Cape of Good Hope before it got busy, so we could take our pictures by the sign before it went mad (he guessed about 10 -15 mins after we got there). Rob kept his word, we got great pictures and 10 minutes later hoards of coaches and cars arrived and the only pictures people could get of the sign, were those with crowds of strangers in. Rob's happy to take pictures of you and will also show you some of the best places to take the photo's from.It would take too long to individually list everything that was good about the day but here's a summary.Picked up from accommodation as promised - bang on time.Rob is one of the most knowledgable, engaging, funny people you will ever meet. You end the day feeling as though he's one of your best mates.Fantastic tour that fits so much in to one day - astonishing balance between relaxing and fast paced.We saw some of the most beautiful scenery possible, had to stop for an Ostrich, watched baboons on the Cape, pulled over on a beautiful beach drive to see a huge number of wild dolphins swimming near the shore (maybe 20 or more), watched penguins at the fabulous Boulders Beach, had a lovely lunch in Simon's Town - and so it goes on!If you're considering a tour - you must go with Rob. Like us, you can then join his many fans on this page who have had an amazing experience and loved every minute. Thanks again Rob!"

We were very lucky with the weather...the best day in a while. There were many sights along the way and Rob never rushed us. He is an excellent guide, very knowledgeable, and has a great sense of humour, which always makes a great day even better! There were many amazing photo opportunities. I would definitely recommend Cape Convoy Tours to anyone visiting Capetown."

He was so friendly with my children and made sure we saw all the sights around the cape. We reckon it would have taken us three days to have covered the same ground on our own.

However, this time with driving being on the opposite side and time constraints, I opted for a tour of the cape. I discovered Rob through the trip advisor website. He was quick to answer e-mail, and setting up the tour was easy. The tour was not what I expected, but in a great sort of way. Rob is an energetic, intelligent, funny, witty guide. Riding in him with the car, I just wished the day would never end. The day was full of interesting information, of personal stories, geography, history - simply the right mix of everything. Then we get to the cape, and we were a small group, so he let us wander on our own!If you are looking for an interesting, funny and different kind of tour to the cape, look no further. Rob is the guy for you. This was an experience to cherish, and one I will always be smiling when thinking of."

We weren't especially lucky with the weather that day, but Rob's local knowledge and flexibility meant we got to see all the highlights at the best moments. He's a great character with lots of stories and jokes which kept us all entertained, as well as a wealth of information about the history and geography he shares with everyone. The area is beautiful and is worth seeing with or without a guide, but if you want fun and light-hearted way to see the Cape with some local knowledge thrown in too, we can't recommend Cape Convoy highly enough."

I don't think we stopped laughing and learning the entire tour! Rob is incredibly energetic, knowledgeable, and funny - a super tour guide! He always told us the route of our tour and stopped along the way when he saw a great photo opportunity. He definitely knows the in's and out's of touring the peninsula and made sure we were most efficient with our tour route.We asked in advance if we could visit the seal island in Hout Bay and he was kind enough to arrange our tour itinerary to squeeze in our request. Also, on the morning of our tour, we mentioned to Rob that we hadn't been able to visit Table Mountain yet due to the fog and the next day we were leaving to go to Stellenbosch. Rob told us we most definitely couldn't leave Cape Town without going to Table Mountain. Since we had such a beautiful day, after we finished our awesome tour with Rob (including seal island, Boulders Beach, Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope), he drove us back to Table Mountain in time for us to take in the evening views. The traffic was really terrible leaving the mountain but he insisted on driving us all the way to the top to drop us off at the entrance. It was incredibly nice of him. We squeezed in a lot in one day but Rob never made us feel rushed. We all really loved our day with him and think I can say for all of us, his tour was the highlight of our visit to Cape Town!"

I'm sure everyone had a great time. And who can forget the fisk & chips in Simons Town and the beautiful scenic route along Chapmans Peak on our way back. Thanks Rob, I really had a fantastic day!"

We can honestly say that is was the most enjoyable tour we have ever been on. Rob picked us up promptly at our hotel and then we picked up 2 other couples to join us on our adventure. He immediately set the tone for the day and put everyone at ease with his spirit and enthusiasm. Rob laid out our plan for the day to hit all of the highlights of the beautiful Cape Peninsula. We were fortunate to also have an absolutely perfect day for our touring. He knew to beat the large tour operators by going straight to the Cape of Good Hope before the crowds arrived. Throughout the day he kept us involved and interested in what we were seeing with his extremely vast knowledge of everything we saw. The pace was never rushed and offered ample opportunity for exploring and photo ops. When we stopped in Simons Town for lunch he had many recommendations for different restaurants so everyone could chose something to their liking. We could not believe his knowledge, enthusiasm, and constant humor; we felt as if we were seeing all of this beauty with a long time personal South Africa friend instead of just another monotone tour operator. Highly, highly recommend"

Some tour operators did not respond at all, some recommend contacting them couple day in advance while I am in Cape Town. Not acceptable for me. Rob was different. He offered 3 days Garden Route Tour, instead of 4 I originally was looking for, but with all places I would like to visit. When he arrive to pick me up at the hotel it appears that couple who supposed to be in the tour with me cancelled their booking. So it turned to be private tour. I was really impressed that Rob kept his commitment to me. Travelling with him is a lot of fun. His knowledge of the country, area we travelled is complete. Hotels he booked were excellent and restaurants he recommended worth a visit. We stopped at interesting points of Route 62, visited Ostrich Farm and Kango Caves in Oudtshoorn area, Tstitsikama, Knysna, Mossel Bay. His flexibility is also worth mentioning. Depends on weather conditions and his customer\u2019s interests he can add something different to the tour. Results: I saw more than I planned to see during the tour and made lots of pictures from one of the most beautiful places in the World. In short Garden Route Tour with Cape Convoy exceeded my expectation and I would recommend it to anybody. When I will be back in Cape one day, Cape Convoy would be my first choice for tours. Thanks Rob!"

We hit on all of the major spots along the Garden Route; Knysna, Tstitsikama, Plettenberg Bay; and even added in an afternoon of walking with elephants at a sanctuary after Rob learned of my girlfriend's obsession with them. Rob booked us into wonderful accommodations along the way and went above and beyond to ensure that everything was to our liking. He truly cares about the well being of his guests and always had informative stories and humorous jokes to keep the conversation going on the scenic drives from location to location.

The only thing to watch out for are the ostriches... they run at you while being photographed.

Rob is also flexible and timed each attraction perfectly so we missed all the crowds, especially when we visited Boulder's beach which was very impressive. This allowed us to enjoy and appreciate each attraction so much more. We also saw the most amazing scenery during our tour.I cannot recommend Cape Convoy highly enough!

Then we stopped at Simontown for a restroom, lunch and shopping break. There were street vendors who had the best souvenir prices that I have seen in Cape Town\u2026if you bargained hard. At Cape Point, we had approx. 1 1/2h to spend at the lighthouse and hike. Then we drove to the cap of good hope and, again, Rob managed to get us to the sign and our photos taken in record time.

I mention that only to display the integrity of Cape Convoy. If I ever make it back to Cape Town I will definitely use Cape Convoy again! Thanks Rob for the fun day."

Punctual, welcoming, full of information but not spouting it like he swallowed the Internet, thoughtful towards our needs, a careful and confident driver, and, most of all, took us to all the most perfect places in and around Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope. Rob was also lots of fun and but at the same time able to discuss the broader facts of the history, the economy and political situations in many parts of the world. Stimulating, entertaining, knowledgeable.....like I said, the perfect Guide."

My family and I did a tour of the Cape of Good Hope and Winelands with Rob last month and it was absolutely one of the highlights of our trip! Rob is the best tour guide you could ask for. He is extremely knowledgeable about everything he shows you, and I guarantee you will be laughing the entire day as he shares funny stories and anecdotes with the group. Our tour group was fairly small (a total of 8 people), which was the perfect size. I was a little worried about squeezing tours of the Cape of Good Hope and Winelands in one day, but Rob made it happen and we never felt rushed. We were able to fully experience and enjoy every stop along the way. It's a day we'll never forget!"

We were able to explore at our own pace, stopping for photos of ostriches and baboons along the way. We could take as long as we liked at Cape Point. He recommended a great fish and chips place for lunch in Simon's Town. The penguins were definitely a highlight (and again Rob suggested a path - or boardwalk - less traveled to avoid the crowds). He was also our photographer for the day, taking some great family photos. The time en route passed quickly as we had some interesting conversations. All in all a perfect day! Thanks Rob!"

He kept us engaged in conversation and regaled with information about Cape Town and its history as he drove us from point to point. On the way to pick us up, his vehicle broke down and Rob was very good in communicating this to us. He called our hotel to let us know what had happened and went to retrieve another vehicle. We really appreciated that he made the effort to make our trip happen even though it was just the two of us that day. Rob took us to Simonstown, Boulders Beach, Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope. At each stop, he gave us all the important information about the stop (what we could see, what we could do, etc.) and then we had free time to explore. We had enough time at each stop and didn't feel rushed. We also had brief stops at various scenic viewpoints to enjoy the scenery and stop for a photo opportunity."

He even changed the game plan in a second when the group decided to go and take a boat out to the fur seals and their islands.

Just cant stop saying about him.It was a first experience for us to get a local person in South Africa for our first visit to this beautiful country to show us around this vast nation. I started to communicate with Rob from home and booked with Cape Convoy for a day tour of Cape Peninsula. A few days later i happen to look at his website and he offered 4ngts/5ngts packages for Garden route tour too. I too was planning to self drive on the route for about 7 ngts till Port Elizabeth. I quickly put forward a proposal to Rob if he could join us for 7ngts on the tour that i had customised myself and not for 4 ngts.He could drive us in his car from CT till PE for 7 days and be our guide.thats it. We had a quite a few email exchanges before Rob and I freezed our deal. And i was happy we both agreed. And my wife too as she did not want me to drive for long in a country not known to us.that too for 7 days with a 3 year old with us.As she and I would not be able to spend quality time as i would be exhausted. Probably i could not have seen this country more leisurly,casually if i was driving.where to stop,what to see,drive rules, safety issues etc etc use to bog our mind.So here comes Rob Our messiah!!!. He is such an amazing honesh kind hearted guy. We just finished our cape point tour. it was a detailed day tour with amazing views of cape town and peninsula. The best tour ever with Rob. And next day we were again off for 7 days on our garden route tour with the best guide in the world. My family including our lovely 3 yr old daughter too developed a good rapport with Rob. As soon as he drops us at every accomodation and he leaves us alone we start to miss him again. He was talkative, joyous and we missed his company. His toyota van was awesome. too big for a 3 people. it can accomodate 10 on a tour. Imagine we were only 3 and rob in this big van. it was fun.My daughter could literally sleep and run around at the back.All along the way from Cape town till 7 days to PE we stayed at all places, Rob guided us along the way,from cape town we stopped at Montagu(my wife shopped for nuts etc),Ladismith etc. Rob totally did not mind and he was cool and we got a know a lot about south africa,its history etc on the way.we started with Oudtshoorn(Cango and Ostrich farm),Knysna,Mosselbay(for shark diving),Storms river(Tree Canopy and Suspension bridge)Did you know, he walked the suspension bridge with us. its a 600 mt steep climb,He didnt have too but he did.He is not a commercial guide,he justs wants to get involved with his clients,be a part of the fun. At storms river he dropped my family at the rest camp and then we went to Tree Canopy tours in Tsitsikamma village. I finished the tour and he was right outside waiting to pick me up and drop me at rest camp. Then it was Addo and then rob drove us to PE with a stop over at Cheetah farm.It was really sad for all of us to part ways from PE as we were flying to Kruger. Rob is so enthusiatic,would take initiative,stop for photos etc. He helped us get discounts for us. its just truly amazing. I mean who would do that.??? He is that kind.he says he doesnt want to earn extra rather he would give his clients discounts.He wants to show his country in the best possible way he could. He surely met our expectations. Exceeded our expectations.ROB YOU ARE FAMILY!!!! WILL COME BACK!!!!Visited August 2012"

Thanks, Rob, will always remember you for helping us to have a great trip to Capetown!"

We had the best vacation of our lives. Rob is the ultimate host. He is energetic, knowledgeable, interesting as heck to listen to and watch, and he excels at what he does because he sees things from his customers perspective. His super charged brain is always thinking, \"How can I make this better for my guests? What can we do better to enhance the experience for them? What do they need now?\" It's all about YOU. We have never experienced a tour guide like Rob. He is the ultimate. It's enough to make you feel positively spoiled! If you are looking for a boring and laid back experience then Rob is not your guy."

Rob got us up early to avoid the large crowds. We were able to see the splended scenery without huge masses of people. In addition he became a good friend. We felt that we were seeing the sights with a friend. On our second excursion we went to the Capetown Wine country and did some local city sightseeing. We had a glorious day. Rob made us feel so welcome. He was also very accomodating. On our first tour he picked us up at our hotel, while on our seond tour he picked us up at our cruise ship at the the V and A waterfront. Our trip to Capetown was the highlight of our cruise. I will always miss Capetown"

He is the most enthusiastic, knowledgeable and fun tour guide you could ever hope to meet. I have noticed that a very few number of people on TripAdvisor have rated this tour as average\u2026 I think there must be something wrong with them if they cannot appreciate such fantastic day. Even before you meet Rob, you feel like you know him. His e-mails are so friendly and welcoming. You feed off of his energy and love for such a beautiful country.As soon as you meet Rob, the day is immediately exciting. He is honest and interesting in his approach and there is not a moment of the day where you are not completely enthralled in what he is telling you and what you are looking at. He is so knowledgeable and passionate about South Africa that I believe even the most miserable of people can be inspired by him. You feel like the tour is tailor made for your needs. He completely caters to what you want to see and do. Nothing is too much trouble for him and you are thoroughly entertained for the whole day. The penguins were my favourite part but after extensive talk and joking about the infamous honey badger, Rob went out of his to take us to see one. It was the best day of our trip and I cannot recommend the tour and Rob as a tour guide enough. We have stayed in touch with Rob and are so looking forward to visiting South Africa again to spend another day with him. This is a MUST if you are visiting South Africa. Cape Point is quite simply the most beautiful place on earth and to see it with Rob is all the more special. You will have a sensational day and make an even more sensational friend!"

As I e-mailed around to different tour companies, I was beginning to wonder if we could manage to see what we wanted during our quick visit. Then I e-mailed Rob at Cape Convoy. He was the perfect guy to make sure we saw everything we wanted - and not just that, we saw what we wanted and we saw it how we wanted to see it. We did a Cape Point tour with a bit of Cape Town thrown in. We saw Rhodes Memorial, The Cape of Good Hope, Cape Point, Table Mountain, Signal Hill, the penguins, Hout Bay and Chapman's Peak Drive. To do all that in a day, you need a flexible, high energy guide, and Rob fit the bill perfectly! many thanks Rob."

He is extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the history and culture of the city. For those who know Cape Town will know the weather can be a bit of a lottery at times, but Rob has a knack (mainly due to how long he\u2019s lived there) of knowing which area to go to when the weather would be at it\u2019s best. When we went to Boulders Beach to see the penguins he immediately took us along a path opposite to where everyone else was going. We ended up on one side of a small bay by ourselves when all the other tourists were huddled on the other trying get to the front to take photos. Nothing is too much trouble and he doesn\u2019t mind stopping at anytime so you can take that sudden landscape photo!Thanks once again Rob."

            "review": "A great tour! Rob is a legend!. We first came across cape convoy, from reading other people\u2019s trip advisor reviews we knew Cape Convoy sounded like a great tour so we booked the cape point tour. Before we even departed Essex, Rob was very enthusiastic about welcoming us on his tour before we even got on the bus. And I have to say from start to finish, this was one of the best tours I have ever been on. For this tour, it is an early start as Cape Point is a 4-hour drive away from central Cape Town. 24 hours before the trip commences, Rob will either ring or email to confirm your booking and also arrange a pick up time. On our tour we had a small van, and we travelled with two other parties. I find a smaller group better, because there is more interaction and is easier to talk to the tour guide. On our way to our first stop, Rob explained the tour and then started to talk about the history of Cape Point. I found this very interesting and learnt quite a lot about South Africa in one day because Rob interacted with the group instead other tour guides just giving you a leaflet with all the information inside it. As Cape point is a very long drive away, Rob has a stop over in the morning. Firstly, you stop at Hout Bay to see the seals. As you pay all the fees beforehand, Rob will sort out the excursion for you. The boat journey is around 45 minutes long. But when get to the seals, it is just amazing and is great chance to get your first photographs of the day. Also you get to see some beautiful landscapes whilst on the boat ride. This is also a good chance to go to the toilet, get a beverage and a chance to purchase your first souvenir of the day, as there is a market. When you depart Hout Bay you travel along a mountain road where you get stunning views of the ocean and also Simonstown (which is the next stop of the tour). Another perk travelling with a personal tour company such as cape convoy is unlike big operators who take massive buses; you can't stop to take photos unlike what we did. Rob knew the exact spot where to take a photo and we got a great view of the town and the ocean. It was breathtaking. When you get to the town, you have a short break to stretch your legs and take in the stunning views. Then you then go to a penguin colony. At the penguin colony you get a chance to see African penguins. Once again I thought this was a nice extra touch to the trip, as you learn about the wildlife that South Africa has to offer and the views once again were amazing! Rob is always on hand to take photos when needed so that you can show your friends and family when you get home! Then you go the main attraction of the day, the Point itself. However, again Rob who is brilliant in finding terrific photograph spots, found this spot to take a photo which is still my facebook photograph! In the distance, you have the beautiful blue sea alongside the last piece of land of Africa. It was great! Then you drive down and you enter Cape Point. Rob lets you go round the area on your own, but is always on hand to help answer your queries, if you have any problems. You spend around 2.5 hours in the point and when we went it was quite misty, but nevertheless I got some photographs, which I will keep forever! You have to climb a lot of stairs to the top and but the views you get are just brilliant. You see the last bit of land, before miles and miles of ocean awaits. You also get see how many miles other cities are from the point including London and Rio de janiero. Truly remarkable. It is also quite windy up there as it is up a high altitude. In addition, you can also get food and use the other amenities. When you leave the Point, you make your way back home! But before you leave, Rob again takes you to another great photograph spot! On this occasion, you get a chance to have a photo with the cape point sign. Another great photo! On the way back, and another perk travelling with Rob, you get a chance to travel down another mountain road. This time, as it was nearing sunset, Rob stopped the van again, and took us to a beautiful beach. The sand was so soft and was very cool as well because it was a hot day. We even saw a whale as well, which was making this trip so good! And finally, you then stop at the table mountain natural park, where you get great views of the mountains and even a view of lion's peak. It was great way to end a great trip and one I will have great memories in years to come. Rob then drops you off at your hotels or apartments. Overall the trip was just brilliant and I believe the tour was reasonably priced. And Rob is one of the most funniest and informative people I have ever met, so if you want a tour which is value for money, get to know south Africa a bit more, go with Cape Convoy. You will not be disappointed!"

I felt like we were friends even before my family and i had left the country. He is one of the most genuine people I have ever met and all he is concerned about is his clients and ensuring that they have the best and most memorable time ever. Rob is absolutely passionate about what he does. His knowledge is endless and he tells you everything in such a fun and interesting way. We laughed so much on our Cape Peninsula tour. I had a problem with my leg which meant I didn't feel fit enough to do some of the walking but he drove me up to the top of the walk and never once made me feel he was being put out or that I was holding everyone up. He was thoughtful enough also to know that when you are travelling as a family , you rarely get a family photo and he always offered to take our pictures. He knew all the best places to get the perfect shots. This is just a snippet of the things he did to go the extra mile. We did the trip on the 2nd Jan a national holiday so extremely busy. Rob thought all this through ensuring our pick up times were early enough to miss the hundreds of people all going out and the long traffic jams. He is meticulous in his planning and has great attention to detail. The trip it's self is a must do. The penguins at Boulders Beach blew me away. My husband and children saw baboons on their walk at Cape point. We also saw tortoises and zebra to name but a few of the animals we came across. Due to the high winds we did not manage to go on the shark dive. Rob tried his best to get us revised dates so that we did not miss the experience but I didn't want to do it on my last day . Rob was very understanding about this and true to his word we got every penny refunded to us. He said even if the Shark company didn't refund he would pay us back out of his own pocket. That says it all. He is genuine, honest and completely sincere. I hope we go back to South Africa one day and meet up with Rob again."

Rob and Julius were brilliant and have such great energy, they do their utmost to make sure that you see as much and gain as much information on your trip as possible.

At the end of the three days we knew more about South Africa and it's rich history than you could imagine. We tell all our friends that a trip to Cape town is not complete without tours with Cape Convoy. Rob really made our time in Cape Town unforgettable.

Also, I was a little concerned about certain parts of the tour because I was 13 weeks pregnant at the time, however, Rob was very conscious of my condition and provided some alternatives to some of the long hiking trails during the tour.

In just a few hours we saw all the famous landmarks, beautiful beaches, including Boulder's (with the penguins) and of course, the Cape of Good Hope. The drive is really treacherous, especially for those not used to driving on the left. Some portions are pretty sheer cliffs, and once we saw the road we were relieved we did not venture out in a rental car. It is a gorgeous drive though, and since Rob was behind the wheel, we were able to truly enjoy it.

This was our first trip to South Africa and my husband and I knew very little about the county, what to see/ do, etc. so we decided it was best to book a tour for the beginning of our trip. Coming from California we wanted to get the most out of our S.A. stay and Cape Convoy Tours gave us everything we hoped for and more! We booked the Garden Rout tour and Rob was an amazing tour guide and so much fun! My husband and I had a blast and felt so comfortable with him the whole time. We could tell instantly we were in good hands! Every day was an amazing adventure that gave us unforgettable memories. We stayed in wonderful bed and breakfasts, enjoyed delicious meals, and lovely company. And on top of it all, Rob knew everything there was to know about the history of the country. We never wanted the tour to end! Cape Convoy Tours is a definite MUST and a real South African gem. Our trip would not have been nearly as wonderful had it not been for Rob. If and when we go back to South Africa, there's no question that we will be booking another tour with Rob! Anyone traveling to S.A. should absolutely book Cape Convoy Tours to get the most out of this amazing country! Thank you Rob!!!!!"

Rob knows the route and the weather very well - The weather was disagreeable in the morning, so Rob took us to the Rhodes Memorial and extended our drive so that we would arrive at Cape Point once the sun popped out again. He is fun, energetic, and knowledgeable, a good combination for a long day tour. He fills the drive with his crazy experiences, history and interesting facts about South Africa. We also saw interesting wild life on the way \u2013 baboons, penguins, giant deer things, and ostrich, We went to Rhodes memorial, smithtown, boulder\u2019s beach, cape point, cape of good hope, an ostrich farm, and did chapman\u2019s peak drive all in one day. Would definitely recommend this tour!"

We met early in the morning and went out first thing to the Cape of Good Hope. The drive on the way was wonderful and informative, with Rob filling in lots of historical and cultural background. [Fair warning: Rob is a bit of a talker, so even if you are introverted there will be a conversation going!] The early start was brilliant, as we beat the crowds of busses and had the whole place to ourselves. I recommend this, and if you are visiting from the west you'll be up early because of jet lag anyway.Rob was flexible and accomodating of what the group wanted to see, and how long we wanted to spend at each place. We hit so many highlights and had a beautiful day. He knew of just the right places to stop for a perfect view and photos, and which walks to take to get the best experience. He really knows the area well, and works hard to make sure his guests get the most out of the trip. I thought it was great, and am so glad we had this day! Thanks Rob!"

We visited all nice sights of Cape Point and surroundings. Boulder Beach, Hout Bay, Cape of good Hope etc. Robert is a very enthusiastic person with lots of stories, humour and attention. He is very helpful and personal. We had lots of fun with Robert.The wine tour to Stellenbosch was also good fun. Robert took us to 4 wineries, not the big ones but the beautiful ones. We tasted wines in combination with chocalate, which was very good. And also his high energy level made this a great day. If you consider some day trips than I recommend Robert, because he has the knowledge, experience, he knows the best places and is very helpful and funny!"

Rob tailors the tour to get the maximum for his guests, and the informal approach was perfect for us.

            "review": "Enjoyable tour. We (partner and I) did the tours earlier this year but never got the time to write a review. I really enjoyed both the tours we did with Rob - the Cape point day tour and the Stellenbosch Wine tasting tour.Throughout the Cape point tour, Rob was very informative and he always made sure that we were happy with the activities throughout the day. He gave us enough time to climb to the Cape point and to grab a sandwich. We went to most of the beautiful and picturesque places on the day. Most of the time was spent at the locations as opposed to just sitting in the van which was the best part. The rest of the group consisted of one single lady and another family of 3(mum dad and an 8 yr old boy) so we didn't end up being thrown into a large tour bus. The only flaw I experienced was that Rob also spent a lot of time discussing country-specific politics with the gentleman which wasn't too interesting for us. I'm not saying he didn't include us in his topics but we felt a bit out of place during those 'off-track' discussions. Moreover, their 8 yr old son was hyper and that annoyed us for a fair bit as well (not Rob's fault at all). The wine tasting tour was perfect as we met an older British couple and we all gelled well together and had a great time. One tip for those opting for this tour - definitely visit the 'aviary/zoo' at Spier wine estate. It has owl and eagle encounters for an extra price and is too good. The trained baby owl called glory just made my day. There's also a cheetah encounter option for approx. \u00a311 but really isn't worth as the cheetah is sleeping most of the time and there are like 50 rules about stroking it and even taking pictures!! All in all, Rob is a wonderful guy with in-depth knowledge on South Africa and the tours are certainly worth booking. Just in case you want to avoid some annoying kids - I feel it's best to ask Rob about the rest of the group beforehand!!"

He took us to fantastic places, some of which we would never have found on our own and nothing was too much trouble. There were 4 other guests in the minbus and he was very good at tuning in to what each person was interested in. We never felt rushed and he seemed really committed to making sure that all of us had a fantastic time. He really knows the Cape inside out and is delighted to share it with you.I would recommend him without any hesitation."

Rob is really knowledgeable about the area and its history and this is all delivered in a really fun way with stories which makes you want to listen to more. Whilst there is a route that Rob follows we had time to stop for the Baboons we spotted and also the Ostriches and you do not feel that you are being rushed along. Having spent some of his years in Essex, England we were able to have some good banter with him, and ha made sure he engaged with everyone throughout the day. This was a long day out but it flew by and we saw absolutley loads. A good tip is to rememeber any dates that Rob throws at you it can be very rewarding!!!!!"

If you're unsure whether to book, I can highly recommend you do! Rob is an all round excellent guide - well informed, friendly and very accommodating. It's a very personal tour - not at all like being on a coach / tour bus. He was really flexible for us - making recommendations and tailoring his usual schedule to suit what we really wanted to do.We went on the Wine Tour, which was wonderful. Rob knew loads of great places to go which were beautfiul, not too touristy and had excellent wines. We visited 4 or 5 vineyards and sampled wines from all sorts of price brackets - including some pretty exclusive bottles. If you think you might want to visit Stellenbosch, I really recommend going on a tour with Rob as it means you can enjoy all the wines without one of you having to be a designated driver.We also went on Rob's Cape Peninsula Tour which is definitely a must-do! Rob took us early to Cape of Good Hope, which was such a good move as we got there before the coaches started arriving - so we had it all to ourselves. It's such a beautiful country and the Cape is especially stunning - the tour was spectacular all round. Cape Point was definitely the highlight for all of us. Though you can do this drive yourself (it's quite a long one), you'd miss out on all the fun and knowledge you get from travelling with Rob. When you arrive at attractions, he was good and giving us time to explore ourselves and setting off again when we were ready.Travelling with Rob was the most fun we had on our holiday - I can thoroughly recommend Cape Convoy Tours."

Just cant stop saying about him.It was a first experience for us to get a local person in South Africa for our first visit to this beautiful country to show us around this vast nation. I started to communicate with Rob from home and booked with Cape Convoy for a day tour of Cape Peninsula. A few days later i happen to look at his website and he offered 4ngts/5ngts packages for Garden route tour too. I too was planning to self drive on the route for about 7 ngts till Port Elizabeth. I quickly put forward a proposal to Rob if he could join us for 7ngts on the tour that i had customised myself and not for 4 ngts.He could drive us in his car from CT till PE for 7 days and be our guide.thats it. We had a quite a few email exchanges before Rob and I freezed our deal. And i was happy we both agreed. And my wife too as she did not want me to drive for long in a country not known to us.that too for 7 days with a 3 year old with us.As she and I would not be able to spend quality time as i would be exhausted. Probably i could not have seen this country more leisurly,casually if i was driving.where to stop,what to see,drive rules, safety issues etc etc use to bog our mind.So here comes Rob Our messiah!!!. He is such an amazing honesh kind hearted guy. We just finished our cape point tour. it was a detailed day tour with amazing views of cape town and peninsula. The best tour ever with Rob. And next day we were again off for 7 days on our garden route tour with the best guide in the world. My family including our lovely 3 yr old daughter too developed a good rapport with Rob. As soon as he drops us at every accomodation and he leaves us alone we start to miss him again. He was talkative, joyous and we missed his company. His toyota van was awesome. too big for a 3 people. it can accomodate 10 on a tour. Imagine we were only 3 and rob in this big van. it was fun.My daughter could literally sleep and run around at the back. All along the way from Cape town till 7 days to PE we stayed at all places, Rob guided us along the way,from cape town we stopped at Montagu(my wife shopped for nuts etc),Ladismith etc. Rob totally did not mind and he was cool and we got a know a lot about south africa,its history etc on the way.we started with Oudtshoorn(Cango and Ostrich farm),Knysna,Mosselbay(for shark diving),Storms river(Tree Canopy and Suspension bridge)Did you know, he walked the suspension bridge with us. its a 600 mt steep climb,He didnt have too but he did.He is not a commercial guide,he justs wants to get involved with his clients,be a part of the fun. At storms river he dropped my family at the rest camp and then we went to Tree Canopy tours in Tsitsikamma village. I finished the tour and he was right outside waiting to pick me up and drop me at rest camp. Then it was Addo and then rob drove us to PE with a stop over at Cheetah farm.It was really sad for all of us to part ways from PE as we were flying to Kruger. Rob is so enthusiatic,would take initiative,stop for photos etc. He helped us get discounts for us. its just truly amazing. I mean who would do that.??? He is that kind.he says he doesnt want to earn extra rather he would give his clients discounts.He wants to show his country in the best possible way he could. He surely met our expectations. Exceeded our expectations.ROB YOU ARE FAMILY!!!! WILL COME BACK!!!!"

Rob picked us up right on time at the 12 Apostles Hotel and the trip was incredible. He takes you to see everything you could possibly imagine on a full day tour. Cape of Good Hope was unforgettable. It was a really clear day and Rob kept reminding us of how lucky we were to see across False Bay and that fog and clouds had disappeared. Besides the sites and landscape, the best part of the trip is Rob. The man genuinely is interested in what you have to say and loves to talk. The man does not stop talking (in a good way!). He will make you laugh the second you meet him. He is extremely knowledgable and knows the ins and outs of making the best experience you can make in 1 day. We were considering a shark dive the next day and he said it was a must. He went out of his way to arrainge for us to be picked up the next morning to go to Gansabaai for the dive the next morning. In talking with him, it was clear how hard working and how much he truly enjoys his job. I would recommend him to any person traveling to Cape Town. His tours are memorable and will be a highlight your trip."

I was on a very tight timeline in Cape Town and only had one day to see the Cape and Rob went out of his way to ensure that my experience was a great one. Rob is a very down to earth guy with an amazing sense of humour and one of those truly remarkable people who truly love what they do. Rob went above and beyond to ensure everyone on the tour was not only able to see everything they wanted to see, but also ensured that we all had an enriching experience. I left the tour with a deeper understanding of the area, of the amazing sights and challenges found within South Africa. The tour was excellent value and time very well invested. I would highly recommend Rob to my own friends in a heart beat (and actually already have) - 3 of which have already taken a similiar trip with Rob and all of which have thanked me for my recommendation.

The tour was literally the highlight of our time in CT and we wish that we had booked more time with Rob. He goes above and beyond to make sure you have the best experience possible. The weather was very dodgy in the morning and instead of going along with the tour as scheduled he changed the itinerary around so that we could get the best possible time at the point when the weather was perfect. He is funny knowledgeable and personable - I've traveled all over the world and Rob is by far One of the best tour guides I've ever encountered! He really cares about his people and his passion for what he does shines thru. Bravo Rob, best of luck to you - hope all is well thanks for Making our time in Cape Town so memorable- Carolyn and Scott - New Jersey"

I would certainly recomend Cape Convoy to anyone interested in doing this trip because aftter you've done it, you would see the difference between someone who guides tours for the love of his profession (Rob) and someone who does it mainly for purely commercial reasons (Rob was not interested in selling me anything, or in stoping at any factory or shop, etc),... the difference is HUGHE!

First of all, Rob appreciates his clients and it shows! He really goes above and beyond to ensure your time with him is magical! Before we even met Rob was easy to contact and very flexible. My wife and I were celebrating our honeymoon in South Africa and we had seen the amazing reviews for Cape Convoy on TripAdvisor. We both excitedly booked the full day tour of the Cape Pt. area. Rob was flexible which was great considering the erratic Cape Town weather making our original tour date impossible. The trip itself is amazing. The entire Cape Point region is just oozing with charm. The Cape of Good Hope, Simon's Town, and Chapman's Peak were visually stunning. Rob knew the ins and outs of each location and was able to get us to places ahead of the crowds! He was extremely knowledgeable on wildlife, South African politics, culture and seemingly anything else you might want to know. He's also hilarious! Really, this tour is a gem and both my wife and I highly recommend booking at least one tour with Cape Convoy. Our only regret is that we took our tour on the last day of our stay in Cape Town. If we had more time, I assure you we would have done another tour with Rob. Don't mess around, book it!"

He started of as a guide and ended up being a part of our family. Never seen anyone with so much passion for his job. He is a live wire and his energy is contagious. Have seen many guides in my life and i always looked at them with speculation as we believe that they are just trying to find short cuts. But with Rob whatever he did he did it in the best interest of the group. Never said no to any requests, tried his best to make sure we had a great time. We were a mixed group with kids, teenagers and old parents but he ensured that all of us were entertained and enjoyed equally.The thing with Rob is that he might seem very unconventional and not the run of the mill guides who hands you with a time schedule and push to make sure we stick to it. He is flexible and will change the schedule depending on the convenience and weather but he will ensure that we do and see the best things at the best times. With Rob just forget your schedule trust him 100% and he will make your trip memorable.He is so passionate about his job that on the 6th Day he was really very sick we offered him to take rest, but he said \"this is probably the only time you will be here and I have to make sure you see the best\" and there he was with a dose of antibiotic making sure we still see what he had planned for us. Really appreciate your commitment Rob.Thanks again Rob for such a wonderful holiday... We will always remember you...."

While looking through the reviews we saw nothing but positive and since being back from this trip I as well have nothing to say but positive reviews. If you are looking for the BEST tour company probably in the world BOOK WITH THESE GUYS (ask for Rob he's the best tour guide I've ever met). Rob is very professional, knowledgable, & energetic (We had 3 young kids with our group and he kept them entertained). He will go out of his way to do any thing that you want to do, with our tour we modified many things we wanted to skydive, bungee jump,an elephant observatory and go on a safari and Rob made sure that it all got done by the time we said goodbye. The places that he took us to were top of the line. The perfect spot for that picture the best time to do something and even the best places to eat, all food was amazing and was inexpensive. When my family's 5 day tour was over my brother & I had said that we was going to cry because we felt like Rob was now apart of our family. Since being back in Canada I tell EVERYONE about my experience with these guys, and try to make as many South African references as possible. If you're looking for a life changing trip go to South Africa and book a tour with them, whether it be a day tour or a 5 day tour I can promise you it won't be a decision you regret.Amanda,Ontario, Canada"

Rob knew all the great local spots and we were able to get in on a few extras at low cost. One for example was bottle feeding baby lion cubs for less than $8 USD. I did the wine tour with H. Ross group and I thought that wasn't good at all. The places we stopped for the wine were probably the spots that have Hylton Ross the best deal rather than the best wine/ experience for the customers. I'm positive if it had been Rob and I said I wanted upscale/ downscale he would have made it happen, because that's what we did the entire time. He gauged out interest and energy level for the day and planned it all out.Garden Route: fabulous dinner recommendations, caves, ostrich farm, wine, bed and breakfast to very nice hotels, zip line, hikes, safari, township tour...Cape Point: very cool to see the entire cape and the history.

It was a private tour in a minibus seater 9..(there were only 4of us).The day we were picked up by Rob, we knew that we were going to have a great time.. Rob was very entertaining from start until the end. He told us everything about South Africa and all the interesting (not the boring side) histories and my kids love him so much .. You know how Cape Town weather changed so quickly in winter and he made us to choose the right decision to avoud the rains and the crowds by a different routes to Cape Point ( smart Rob!!). Rob also showed us ostrichs and baboons at Cape Point and we basically beat the crowds and bad weather at every points ... he knew all the good spot to take postcard pictures..At any point during the tour, we never felt the rush we were so relaxed with him .. The drive to chapmans peak was spectacular as well...As an Asian family, we felt amazingly safe and comfortable with him all the time and we simply clicked instantly..Thank you Rob for such a wonderful time in Cape Town and we definitely would ask our friends and families to share another tour with Cape Convoy .."

            "review": "Wonderful Customer Service. Let me begin by saying I never actually went on a tour with Cape Convoy. We had booked a tour out to Cape Point and had confirmed the tour before leaving for South Africa from the States. Unfortunately, the morning of the tour, we got a phone call at our bed and breakfast. Rob had a serious family emergency and would be unable to give us our tour that day. He offered us a choice: he could reschedule the tour for the next day or he could arrange for another company to take us out to Cape Point. Because we already had tickets bought for both Robben Island and Table Mountain for the next day, we chose to have Rob arrange for another tour company to take us out to Cape Point.Within minutes, Rob had us booked for another company's tour (which was a great tour, as well). In addition, he checked in with us that evening to make sure our tour went well. Furthermore, we didn't pay any more for the tour with the new company, and Rob even refunded one of our tickets. So, two of us got a tour out to Cape Point for the price of one. Even more amazingly, he was so apologetic he's given us a standing offer that should we ever be in Cape Town again, we can take his tour as guests. Rob was wonderful, clearly values his customers, and wanted to ensure we still had a great experience. We did. So, thank you for your wonderful service, Rob! If we're ever in Cape Town again (one can only hope!), we'll happily meet with you!"

It was fun, exciting, entertaining, informative and extensive. Rob's knowledge and experience are matched with his passion and enthusiasm for his work. He loves talking about the history and the stories behind every inch of his tour. He delivers it in an entertaining and fun way that will have you hanging on his every word. Rob is not your typical tour guide, he is fun and energetic and gives you the tour you\u2019ve only dreamed about. You need only spend a day with Rob to realise why he gets such great recommendations and has so many customers befriending him on Facebook. We loved our day with Rob on the Tour of the Cape and if and when we go back to Cape Town again we will certainly be going on another tour with Rob and Cape Convoy ToursThanks Rob for a fantastic time and a wonderful experience."

We loved all of our tours. We had the most amazing trip to Cape Town thanks to Rob.I had a good feeling about Rob even before my wife and I made it to Cape Town. We bombarded Rob with tons of emails, and changed our itinerary nearly daily. Rob responded promptly to all of our questions and worked with us to make this trip happen exactly as we wanted it to. Rob picked us up promptly at our hotel on day one (of six total days we spent together), and we embarked on the Garden Route tour. The weather happened to be amazing that day, so Rob flexed the itinerary and took us to Table Mountain so that we didn't miss it later in the trip (due to the high potential for bad weather on the mountain). This was the first of many times that Rob went out of his way to tailor our itinerary so that we got the most out of our visit. It was evident immediately that Rob is passionate about his work. He was energetic and enthusiastic every day (even early in the morning and throughout long days), which was an inspiration to even the most jet-lagged tourist. We had great conversations with Rob, and really feel like he became a friend by the end of our time together. He made our honeymoon extremely special. Thanks Rob!"

Particularly, everyone spoke so highly of Rob, the tour guide. Not only were we not disappointed but Rob made our tour by far the most wonderful day for us in Cape Town and the best day of our holiday. Even the process of booking the tour with Rob was a positive experience. He was friendly and accommodating and easy going. He answered all of our questions and by the time the tour came, it felt like we were already friends. It was just the two of us and Rob on the tour the day we booked and the whole day was fantastic. Rob was so knowledgable, not only about Cape Town and South Africa's history, but about everything we spoke about that day. He took us to the most stunning places and educated us about the significance of each destination. Rob has such a passion for South Africa and its history that you really feel like you are apart of the story as you drive through the breath-taking scenery. Rob was so accommodating. He tailored every part of the day so we could maximise our enjoyment and experience at every single place. The day just got better and better. The penguins were my favourite part but the views from Cape Point are indescribable. We laughed all day and had so much fun. Rob did everything in his power to ensure we loved every moment of the day. We got to experience all the best parts of Cape Town in a way I'm certain no other tour guide could provide. By the time we finished the tour and were saying goodbye to Rob, it felt like we were saying goodbye to an old friend. Would do the tour everyday if I could and cannot recommend it enough. A MUST!Thanks Rob :)"

I had researched trip advisor to try and find a tour company that would be able to handle 8 people. The plan was to see as much as we could of the highlights that South Africa had to offer. Cape Convoy Tours stood out as a great choice given the reviews that I read. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. All the positive reviews were right and then some. Rob organized every detail of the trip for us and we didn't have to do a thing. I knew from the beginning that the trip was going to be wonderful because Rob emailed me with all details and kept me up to date with all the updates, hotel accomodations etc. Once we met Rob at our hotel, he became an instant part of our family (my son was upset when the trip was over) He had so much knowledge about the area and kept us occupied on the entire trip with his stories and memories of the area. Rob bent over backwards to ensure that we were happy. We changed the plans a couple of times and Rob didn't bat an eye to change them. (always with a smile on his face) Hotel accomodations for the Garden Route were first rate, meals included with them were fantastic. All the activities during the Garden Route were well planned and very fun and educational. Rob swapped out activities when the weather didn't seem to cooperate also because he thought the kids with us wouldn't find some items fun. He was Right! Trust him because he knows what he is doing. Rob knew all the special areas to visit (we got closer to the penguins than anyone else did!) the restaurants to eat at and the places to avoid. Rob was affordable and we got more than our money's worth. Thanks Rob for a great time and memories that will last a life time."

Rob definately goes above and beyond the call of duty of his job. Rob also has a great outlook on life and he is an inspiration to others.

A tour guide can make or break a tour and he definitely made our days much more enjoyable. We even had some time after the wineries and he took us over to Table Mountain which was one of the more incredible parts of our time in Cape Town. The whole thing was very relaxed and honestly we felt like we were just riding around with a friend all day.This is not a stuffy, quiet, stare-out-the-window type of tour. It's involved and you'll be chatting about what you are seeing and learning new things all day. I laughed a lot, which isn't something that you think about doing on a tour, but it is definitely the sign of a good day."

On behalf of the family I researched every tour company I could find and eventually decided to go with cape convoy. I contacted Rob and from his first email knew I had made the right choice! He was so quick to answer my questions and was very willing to work around the needs of our group. When we finally met I felt like I was meeting a friend. We had an awesome trip. He is full of facts about the surrounding area. We made lots of stops and he really focused on the areas we were interested in most. It's a fun filled day and rob is full of energy. Look no further!!! Go with Rob! You will NOT be disappointed."

The excellent, laid-back but very well-structured tour from Cape Town to the Cape of Good Hope and back was a most amazing experience. We returned to our hotel with life-long memories and gorgeous photos, truly inspired (and very tired). In a nutshell: We would want to rate this tour with six stars but Tripadvisor regrettably contemplates only five. The greatness of our experience was almost entirely due to the remarkable performance -- and man, he did perform! -- of the most august of tour guides I've seen in my life -- Rob Salmon. A provocative blend of South African and English roots, this dyed-in-the-wool entertainer-plus-guide not just introduced us to the unmatched beauty of the Cape, its most scenic environment and the locals but provided in-depth insight in what is going on in the heads and hearts of Capetonians, their local culture, politics and gossip. Rob's discursive, non-stereotypical way of explaining things sets precedent. Perfect for people able and willing to think out-of-the box about this marvelous country. Rob, if you read this, you're awesome. You checked all the boxes. Also the unusual and astonishing ones. Chapeau!"

Occasionally, you \"hit the jackpot\" with a tour and take away fond memories from the experience. Rob, owner/operator of Cape Convoy Tours, with his winning personality, quick wit and vast knowledge of the history and culture of South Africa, is a sure bet.From my initial contact months prior to our visit, Rob was quick to respond to my inquiries in a complete and professional manner. I booked the \"Full Day Cape Point Tour\" followed the next day with the \"Winelands Tour & Tasting\".There were 4 hotels involved with our pick-up. Rob met me first in a clean, well maintained mini-van. I immediately got wrapped up in Rob's energy and enthusiasm about how our day would play out. It was obvious he had a keen sense of humor.There was a marathon that day but Rob knew about it so adjusted our route to avoid any traffic tie-ups. On our way to the \"Point\", Rob used the amazing scenery and our \"must see list\" as a framework to paint a picture of the history and culture of the area. He is obviously a history buff with a gift for storytelling that's not even close to being boring.The list of places we visited is too long to post here but the beaches and surrounding vistas are magnificant. Where else can you see baboons and ostrich meandering along the roadside? And the penguins at Boulder Beach are amazing. At the finish of our day, we came to appreciate the beauty, people and culture of this land to an extent greater then we could have imagined. Bravo Rob and thank you!I'll post a review of the Winelands Tour separately."

After finding Cape Convoy in the Rough Guide and reading reviews on Tripadvisor, I booked 2 tours with Rob - the Cape Point day tour and the Garden Route 5 day tour.I'm so glad I did!Just a short time after you meet Rob it is like you have known him for years - he becomes one of your friends! We had a small group and at the end of both trips it was so strange to think that we had known each other for less than a week!He is friendly, funny, enthusiastic and so easy to chat to. He is so passionate about Cape Town and South Africa and has a vast knowledge about its history and trivia.The Cape Point day tour was the first one I did and took us down the coast via the picturesque Chapmans Peak drive. We saw all the sights down the peninsula including Hout Bay and Seal Island, Boulders Beach and the penguins, Simon's Town and various bays and beaches along the way. It was a great day, despite the changeable weather and the highlight was of course Cape Point and its lighthouse. Seeing a lady being mugged of her lunch by a baboon was pretty funny too! (Its ok - she was laughing too).After this daytrip, I couldn't wait for my Garden Route tour. I wasn't disappointed!The amount of stuff I did is too much to list here but includes: riding an ostrich (yes really!) at Oudtshoorn, stroking cheetahs at Cango, exploring at the Featherbed Nature Reserve in Knysna, zip-lining through the forest canopy at Tsitsikaama, a day-safari at the Botlierskop game Reserve, the highest bungy jump in the world at Bloukrans Bridge (which was AWESOME!) and generally exploring and appreciating the beauty of the Garden Route and its coastline.Rob cares a lot about his guests and just wants them to have the best trip possible so the itinerary for the trip is not totally rigid. He is flexible and is always suggesting extra activities to do if you feel like doing them. If the weather is worse one day than the next, he might suggest doing this today and leaving that for tomorrow. In the evenings, he is always around if you want him, but doesn't impose if you want time to yourselves.The accommodation included on the tour was fantastic - lovely hotels and guesthouses.Overall, this tour was without doubt the highlight of my holiday in South Africa. I had so much fun from beginning to end and was quite sad when we all said goodbye at the end of our trip. I would highly recommend Cape Convoy - Rob is everything a tour guide should be and you would be a fool to go with anyone else! Thanks so much Rob - I will treasure the memories for ever!"

            "review": "Astounding. We arrived in Cape Town on Long Street our first night. We were feeling totally overwhelmed: massive jetlag, culture shock, driving on the left side of the road, and various minor things that were really making us feel a bit down. We brought two travel books with us, but fortunately my wife was smart enough to have the foresight to book with Rob Salmon of Cape Convoy for the Garden Route tour. We slept through our first night with great anticipation for the next day when our tour would begin. Rob picked us up at 9AM and we hit the road to Oudtshoorn. Immediately I felt that book with Rob was a truly great thing! While driving us out of the Central Business District we were given a history lesson with all sides of each issue presented. Cape Town has an amazing history that mirrors the birth of the United States and is representative of colonial history in general; Rob is an EXPERT in South African history. It's not rote recitation of memorized dates and trivia; Rob is passionate and inspired when he speaks. Beyond that, the sites he took us to visit were great! We never would have found Zoe and Huw's charming little guesthouse in Oudtshoorn, stopped to see camels (why are there camels in South Africa?), ridden, yes ridden, on the back of an ostrich, or known the best lunch spots. Staying in Knysna at the waterfront with a beautiful sunset on the docks; enjoying the B&B of a former South African Rugby player with vast untouched beaches on the Indian Ocean, driving through a huge game reserve, it goes on and on; each day was packed with sights to see and filled with Rob's passion for South Africa.Other things about Rob: He is flexible, funny, and an easy conversation partner and friend. When we stepped into his van he informed us of the ground rules: None! We were given option upon option each day that catered to our various interests. Do you want to zip-line through the trees? Take a township tour? See monkeys? Whatever you want, Rob knows!Other plusses include learning the rules of the road (people drive quite a bit differently here than in the US), local customs with regard to tipping, just seeing in general how warm and inviting South Africans are. This tour was an excellent intro to South Africa and I HIGHLY recommend it. Thanks Rob!"

            "review": "Amazing tour and tour guide. According to TripAdvisor reviews, Cape Convoy Tours was number 3 of over 170 tourist attractions but it is wholly mistaken in that assessment as it should easily be number one!!! Rob Salmon started his business some years ago and is the most enthusiastic and knowledgable tour guide I have ever met or traveled with. I booked two tours, the garden route tour (3 nights) and the day Cape tour. My situation was very different to other tourists as I was traveling with my partner who surprisingly was given permission to travel as she between her once every three weeks chemotherapy sessions.The doctor felt that after one year of such treatment with another 6 months to go, she deserved a uplifting holiday. Rob ensured that both of our trips would be just that. The tours were private ones, that is, no other passengers. He catered to our specific needs to the letter. The garden tour was an original as my partner's illness precluded us from doing much of what others would have done and instead we toured attractions that she favoured and yet Rob with his amazingly upbeat disposition happily took us everywhere....even driving way off the beaten track to get some medication. Nothing was too much for him. He was entirely flexible and even dropped us off at Port Elizabeth where we stayed with friends and he drove back the 800 kilometres to Cape Town on his lonesome. Two days later he fetched us from our Cape Twon accommodation for the Cape tour and that was the most brilliant tour ever. Again, it did not have the number of stops that other tourists would take with Rob but, nevertheless, it was awesome. One stop took us to Simon Town and while doing some shopping for souvenirs, a shopkeeper saw me speaking with Rob and took me aside after Rob left and told me that he sees all the tour groups coming by but that Rob is by far the best guide of them all and I couldn't agree more.Rob does these tours because he loves his work and he loves people. He is the most personable fella you can beat and his enthusiasm is contagious. For the outstanding service he provides, his prices are extraordinarily reasonable. Rob is also an honest and very caring individual whose knowledge of the area would be second to none. I cannot recommend Cape Convoy Tours highly enough as superlatives lack the depth of the service provided."

Robbie was so knowledgable and passionate about the history of SA. We walked away with a deeper understanding and respect for SA.

            "review": "!!Go with Cape Convoy if you want the most of South Africa!!. I found Cape Convoy on the internet before my trip to Cape Town, and from the reviews on Trip Advisor it seemed like the obvious choice for my tours during my stay. I wanted a tour of the breathtaking scenery and to know more about the area and its history on my trip. As a 24 year old woman travelling alone, another factor I looked for in a tour company was friendliness and fun. - I chose both a tour of the cape peninsula and a trip to the winelands with Cape Convoy, as I wanted to soak up as much as South Africa had to offer during my short stay (I had only 5 days to explore before my stint volunteering in a township close by).  When I got to Cape Town I contacted Rob, and he spoke to me like he\u2019d known me for years. He had me chuckling in moments and we were only arranging the days for my trips. The morning I was due to join Rob on a tour, he called to ask whether I could do the tour another day during my stay instead.... The day of the arranged tour was a grisly, horrible morning, thick with cloud. He explained he doesn\u2019t like to take people on a tour unless they will have a good time, and on such cloudy days you just cannot see the beautiful scenery, it\u2019s literally not worth it. I am totally grateful of his decision to change the day, as I witnessed the density of the cloud around the Cape mountains! So the next day I went on tour with him down the peninsula, with two other couples. It was a day of sunny intervals, but we literally chased the sunshine in the van. Rob knew which areas to go to at certain times for the best weather, and because of his timing we stayed with beautiful visibility all day. We saw all the wonders the coastline has to offer. Rob is extremely friendly and passionate about his country, which makes for a fantastic guide and a great insight into South African life and history. He is so eager to show his country to his passengers and chats to you about the sights and history like a friend, not like a boring tour guide! But still manages to tell you a lifetime of fascinating information! In contrast to the brilliant tour I enjoyed with Cape Convoy, I went on a pre-organised tour with the Baz Bus a week later with my volunteering company. It followed a similar tour route on the peninsula, but it was awful weather and we paid alot to pretty much see nothing of the scenery. It angered alot of the volunteers that they paid for a tour that had literally shown them nothing of the scenery through terenchal rain. More importantly to me, the guide had the usual, very boring monotone spiel, merely pointing out the places we passed and not connecting with any of the passengers. I felt like I was on a tedious tour bus on a school trip, one in which you end up nodding off on through boredom! With Cape Convoy however, you feel like you are a group of friends (even though you've just met) on a road trip, chatting about different subjects of South Africa and learning about the history from a real South African. Rob is very genuine, and you can see his passion for his tours, in the way he presents the country to you personally and in the best way possible. Rob also has the insights of the areas, where to go on the tour at certain times of the day for the best experience, and where to eat, not to eat etc., and will make sure you get your photo with the \u2018Cape of Good Hope\u2019 sign pronto on the peninsula tour! To also mention the Winelands tour, I went with tourguide Rob on a last minute arrangement due to my time restraints. He is honest and expains that his company partner is the expert on the wines, and is the person to go with if you are interested in serious wine conversations. But that wasn't what I was looking for so was happy to go with Rob. I wanted to see the sights of the winelands and of the wine estates and to experience them with fun. Again, I had a fantastic day, saw beautiful places, stroked a cheetah and got back to my hostel happy. The friends I had made at the hostel and had pursuaded to join me on the tour agreed they didn't expect such fun, and such a fun and friendly tourguide. They were happy I talked them into coming along!Cape Convoy portray the nature of South Africa, unpretentious, fun and a friend to everyone. I wouldn\u2019t have chosen anyone else to see the beauty SA has to offer, and you shouldn\u2019t either. If you are looking for a guide to make you smile and to show you the beauty of SA with fire in his belly, go with Cape Convoy!Any age, any gender, any amount of people, Cape Convoy is the tour company to go with. They have fun with everyone and anyone, make sure you have the best time possible, and I promise you will smile more than any other tour! Feel connected to South Africa, go Cape Convoy!!!!"

After our day with Rob at Cape Convoy, I was so impressed that I felt it was important to share our experience since i used it to select this tour. As you can see from the other reviews on trip advisor Rob is very knowledgeable about South Africa and takes a lot of pride in educating his visitors on really interesting facts of the area, so i won't go into detail on the actual tour. But the most important reason that I would highly recommend this tour is the personal care that Rob gives to each and every person on the tour. Even before, we arrived, we e-mailed back and forth confirming a day and time to pick us up for a tour. I called Rob when we arrived in SA about adding a day to our tour and he called me right back. He called us again to confirm our time so we wouldn't have to wait for pick up. He let us bring our bags on the tour bus as we were changing hotels, saving us the expense of cab and storage fees. The weather in Cape Town seems to change every few minutes and really can make our break some of the tours and not affect others. Rob was very flexible working with us and others who we met on the tour in scheduling the right tour for the right day based on the likely forecast. In the end, I left my jacket on the bus and he had another US couple bring it back to the States for me. My wife and I travel extensively, with her being in the meeting and incentive business, and are reluctant to go on tours as we don't like pretencious generic tours. But our time with Rob and Cape Convoy was the most fun and most personalized tour that either of us had ever been on with a really good group of people who were as fun as Rob. I would be happy to respond to e-mails if anybody needs additional detail, but if you are going to tour the Cape Town area, I would highly recommend Cape Convoy."

            "review": "Rob from Cape Convoy is the best tour guide in Cape Town!. My friends (3 of us 30-something ladies) took two 1-day tours with Rob and Cape Convoy. The first day was a tour of the Cape. It was absolutely beautiful and Rob is a wealth of knowledge on South African history...and anything else you'd like to chat about! We left the Waterfront at about 9am and returned at about 6:30pm. Rob took us to see everything from the penguins at Boulder Bay, to the ostrich mama, papa, and babies at the Cape of Good Hope beach. We went to Table Mountain National Park at Cape Point and were able to sit down and have a delicious lunch and enjoy a glass of wine overlooking the most southern point in South Africa. Wonderful! We then walked to the top of the point for a photo shoot! :) Along the way we stopped and saw baboons, sea kayakers, and even fed a seal!Our second day tour was a tour of four South African wineries. Again we met at the waterfront at 9am. Returning around 6pm. Our first stop was Ernie Els vineyard...my personal favorite. From there we went to Waterford where Rob has set up a tour of the cellar. At this winery they paired wine and chocolate...what more can a girl ask for?! Third stop was the Spier winery and cheetah enclosure. We were able to pet the big cats for a small fee and then sample wines. The last stop was Asara winery. Again Rob had set up a tasting of six wines for us. This day was my absolute favorite day of our week long vacation in Cape Town. Without a doubt Rob completed our South African vacation. He was able to safely navigate us around the Cape all complete with an extensive history lesson and a wonderful sense of humor. For the day tours all you need to bring is some decent walking shoes, your camera, your sunglasses, and a sweater as the cape gets pretty windy!Thanks again Rob!"

We took all three tours with Cape Convoy (winelands, Cape Tour, and shark diving tour). Rob went out of his way to adjust our itinerary due to the weather which resulted in perfect conditions each trip. His friendly personality and the ability to make everyone feel comfortable and involved in the tour was matched by his love for his country and extreme knowledge of the history of the area. He always said if you doubt me GOOGLE IT! He was always correct.Rob is one of those people you meet that you consider a friend from the time you meet him. He even has offered to meet my daughter who will be moving there next year to show her around and be a local source of info and help if needed. He is welcome to stay with us in Texas anytime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

From the moment I first emailed and spoke with Rob, he was excited, energetic, and had us excited! He loves South Africa so much and it comes through in everything he says and does. He honestly wants you to see the best of everything in his country, and he makes the history come alive! We loved that on the wine tours, you end up at places that the big tours don't take you, because they're too expensive. We practically had the places to ourselves!! I loved that it's only small groups and everything is super relaxed and enjoyable. Riding around with Rob was like going to Cape Town, meeting up with a friend, and having him show you around. He knew all the right times to go to places, and what would make for the most enjoyable experiences and pictures! I will be recommending him to everyone I know...in fact I just sent a recommendation to a friend tonight! Thanks Rob, for an amazing trip!!"

We chose Cape Convoy Tours on account of its outstanding TripAdvisor rating and reviews, so our expectations were already high. Our two tours easily surpassed them and were the highlight of our Honeymoon.Rob is simply the best tour guide that I have ever had. He is extremely knowledgeable both about the tour destinations and about the history of South Africa. He is also extremely friendly and entertaining and made the entire tour an utter pleasure. He was also very accommodating and was happy to rearrange one of our tours to a different day on account of me acquiring a 'tummy bug'."

His enthusiasm when speaking about the regions history is infectious. Rob seems to do everything possible to ensure his customers have the best possible experience. We were coming towards the end of our holiday in Cape Town and a combination of high winds / cloud meant that we hadn't made it up Table Mountain. We mentioned this to Rob whilst we were on his winelands tour.Rob assured us that we would make it up table mountain,he mentioned that we would still have time to go up the mountain that day. He phoned a friend who confirmed the cable car was in operation & that the mountain was cloud free. As soon as we'd finished the winelands tour Rob whisked us off to table mountain. Myself and my husband made it up Table Mountain which was pretty much due to Rob pulling out all stops and going above and beyond the call of duty at the last minute to get us up table mountain."

I have traveled all around the world but my two tours that I took with Cape Convoy (one to the winelands and another down the Cape) were my favorite experiences from a three week vacation in South Africa. I still rate Cape Convoy's tour down the coast as one of my most favorite experiences of my life thus far. I usually hate going on tours... I think they are \"too touristy\" or cheesey. But Cape Convoy does it right. The tours are small enough that you get to become friends with others on the trip. The tour guides could answer all the questions I threw at them and managed to come up with places to visit that other similar tour companies didn't spend time at. My sister and I hadn't gotten the chance to walk on a Cape Town beach... so Rob pulled the van over so we got to climb down the slope and walk on the beaches of South Africa. So accomodating and fantastic... a must if your visiting!"

He has an encyclopedic knowledge of the Cape and everything in it. In one breath, he can talk to you about the Cape Ostrich, Baboons, Tortoises, Penguins or any other wildlife you might find. The next breath might be a discussion on Cape History including the indigenous people, Portuguese discoverers, Dutch & English settlers, Charles Darwin and even apartheid. Just for fun, he will throw 15 jokes in between just to keep you on your toes. Rob would give the tours even if he didn\u2019t do it for a living.Bottom line, you cannot find a better Guide or Cape Tour."

If you choose any company to do any tour in South Africa then don't go past this one.

            "review": "Fanastic Tours with a new friend. We booked with Rob from Cape Convoy Tours after finding him on tripadvisor. The reviews were very good and we decided to give it a go. We were not to be disappointed in any way. Rob is a very personable, energetic and intelligent individual. He is deeply passionate about South Africa and will give you a running commentary as you drive along but he is also very willing and able to answer any questions you may have no matter how difficult or awkward they may be. From our first e mail to getting off the mini bus at the end of the tour you are entertained, informed and extremely well looked after. We chose a 2 day package of the Winelands Tour followed by the Cape Point Tour. We did the Winelands Tour with a wonderful older American couple and had a thoroughly relaxing, informative and enjoyable day, (I think the wine played a part too). After collecting us from our guest house we visited 4 very different vineyards which gave us the opportunity to experience excellent wines in very different surroundings, the cost of the tastings is included in the tour which was a pleasant surprise. Throughout the Tour Rob will entertain you with great stories and funny anecdotes but he is also very well-informed regarding the vineyards and the history of wine making in the Cape area. Rob catered for the specific needs of everyone and his primary aim is to ensure that everyone on the bus has a great day. We were then dropped off back at our guest house.We did the Cape Tour the following day with an American couple and a Malaysian couple, Rob will only take a maximum of 6 people to ensure that the experience is personal and to ensure he can give everyone his full attention. We all got on very well and much of this was due to Rob who engaged everyone in the conversations and was genuinely interested to hear our stories and experiences. By the end of the Tour we were all chatting like old friends. The Tour itself was brilliant and the views were breathtaking and the wildlife amazing. To see Baboons, an Eland, Ostriches and seals in their natural environments was wonderful and all the time Rob was educating us on everything from the climate, the wildlife, the history and the hopes for the future in South Africa. Rob also gives you time on your own to wander and enjoy the experience. At no time were we bored listening to Rob, his enthusiasm is infectious and his conversation is engaging, educational & entertaining, (even the corny jokes).In summary we can recommend Rob & Cape Convoy Tours without reservation, the Tours are great, good value for money and Rob will tailor the Tour to meet your needs. He is a pleasure to be with and we definitely feel we have made a great new friend."

It's all been said before but Rob is funny, high energy and great company. Rob knows his stuff and is prepared to be very flexible to accommodate his client's needs. Having been on many many organised tours in the past, in was very refreshing not be be taken to overpriced and poor qualty shops and restaurants that seem to be the priority of the tour guide rather than the tour itself to get his or her commission . We had Rob to ourselves on the Winelands tour and on day 2 enjoyed the company of a very charming lady from the USA, some 20 years younger than us. We all got on really well and it is to Rob's credit that he can 'manage' such groups of strangers and age differences with such skill to ensure that everyone's needs are catered for. it was a great day with a lot of laughter . Rob is very knowledgeable and very passionate about his Country. He felt like an old friend by the end of the 2 days and it was sad to say goodbye! SA is a very very beautiful country and we certainly learnt a lot in our 2 days with Rob . One other point to make is that on the Winelands Tour all the tastings etc were included. The only extra was lunch, which we chose the venue and time for. On the Cape Point tour all entrance fees were also included, again except lunch. I believe that there are some optional 'add ons' to the Cape tour ie boat trip to Seal island but these are clearly stated on Rob's website www.cape convoy.com"

We were lucky to have another brilliant couple join us on the tour, and we had such good fun. You do not need to be a wine expert to enjoy the wine tasting tour, and we made to feel so welcomed at all the stops of the tour, partly due to Rob's great reputation amongst the Estates. He even managed to get us a private wine tour around one of the Estates, which was unexpected and just a great example of how he will go out of his way to give you an excellent experience. His knowledge of the area is vast and will keep you entertained with amusing stories and information as you drive from one place to the other. I promise you will not have a boring bus ride to your destination!We will be telling everyone we know who goes to Cape Town to book a tour with Rob, as we guarantee that it will be a highlight of their holiday.

We were the only people on the tour but Rob did say his maximum group size was 6.We went to Hout Bay and did the seal island boat trip, then on Chapmans Peak drive with a couple of amazing photo stops and then on to Simonstown. When we arrrived here it was quite misty and cloudy - we left Rob to go for a coffee and after about 15 mins he came to find us to suggest that we go to Boulders Bay to see the penguins and then head back to Cape Town for the day. He'd pick us up the next day and take us to Cape Point to see if the weather / visibility was any better!! Wow never had service like that on a tour! Rob dropped us back at V&A about 230pm and then collected us at 8am then next day to take us to Cape Point. We were the first people to arrive and the mist cleared as we drove up - fantastic. Would certainly recommend Rob - most friendly and likeable guide you will ever meet!"

Rob was not only very informative, but also extremely amusing and entertaining. He was flexible and modified our tours appropriately to our interests and desires. (He even allowed me lots of extra shopping time assuring that it did not interfere with our scheduled plans.) One of the funniest times was when Rob cajoled the ostrich to bite at his arms and hands.Our days with Rob were very special. He is a warm, very energetic and entertaining guide who kept us learning and laughing the whole time. He exceeded our expectations."

He rearranged the itinerary in order to get us to Cape Point before the rain hit there. Weather was good at Cape Point, we saw baboons, ostriches, and an eland at the Cape of Good Hope and the penguins on the way back. Rob offered to drive us to the cable car for Table Mountain when we returned to Cape Town, but the clouds had moved in again and we ended up not going. He was a very informative and entertaining guide (lots of history, which we enjoyed hearing), and we appreciated his attitude about the changes that have taken place in South Africa and will probably continue to take place."

We were so happy that we did. Rob has such vast knowledge of the area, wildlife, and history of South Africa. He had tons of entertaining stories to tell along the tour & you can tell he's just really passionate about what he does. I feel like I learned so much in one day. We were a group of 4 total, and he customized the tour to what the group was interested in. He's personable and keeps everyone engaged for the day. When my parents go visit Capetown, I'll be sending them to see Rob because I know they'll be in good hands. Thanks for a great time!!!"

As a tour operator his service was professional throughout our entire experience. He would regularly text us with updates for pick up times. And he warmly greeted us at the front of our accommodation. Rob took us to every place on the Cape that was worth going to. Throughout the trip Rob impressed us on his knowledge of the Cape's history, the people that have influenced its present culture, and the wildlife that inhabit its shores. Robs insight was a comprehensive and hugely entertaining way to experience the Cape. We got to see wild Ostrich's feeding at the Cape of Good Hope, baboons walking along the road, hundreds of seals at Seal island, and the amazing penguins of Boulder. Even at Cape Point, Rob told us of a track that few tourists follow but which gets the most incredible views of the upper lighthouse and where the two oceans meet. During the trip, before we got to our next destination, Rob would explain the history and any entertaining stories that help us to connect with the landmark on more than just a tourist level. He was flexible and gracious enough to go with whatever the group felt like doing. All in all, we couldn't fault Cape 'Convoy on anything. Even my 10yr old daughter was laughing the entire day. Rob revealed to us that his goal is to convince everyone that Cape Town and the surrounding districts is the best place in the world. After our experience today, Cape Town is definitely up their with the best. And Cape Convoy is definitely the way to do it!"

We saw Cape Convoy on Trip Advisor and what glowing reviews they got and being we didn't have a lot of time in Cape Town we thought this was the best way to go. Although, not usually a fan of organized tours, we decided to book our tour...we were not disappointed and all the reviews are true. Rob, our tour guide, first off, is AMAZING and secondly, the tour package is perfect, it covers so much ground and is worth every penny and thirdly, the experience was unforgettable. Rob knew so much history and he's absolutely entertaining. Forget about a stuffy tour bus with a droning tour guide, this guy is HOT and on fire and full of energy and gets you PUMPED about everything you are hearing and seeing, plus he drives you around in a smaller minibus, so it's more intimate and you really bond with your bus mates. Cape Town is gorgeous as it is, but you get to see so many wonderful sights and hear perspectives from a local who clearly LOVES his city and his country and is very proud of where its come from and where it is going. You want to learn a little about where you are vacationing, this tour is for you. We'd have done all their tours had we more time.Right from the start Cape Convoy, the company, was professional and prompt with arrangements and payment. Then, you get a personal pick up from Rob, right at your hotel door...smiling and happy and like I said, full of energy, it's just how you want to start any day! Before you even see the beauty of Cape Town you are feeling good and ready to go because of Rob's jovial nature.With so much ground to cover you think you might get overwhelmed or tired, but not with Rob and not with the itinerary they have planned for you, you can tell a lot of smart & thoughtful planning go into their tours. You just want more and more and until the very end - and our end climaxed with a GORGEOUS soon to be setting sun at Chapman's Peak. We were almost sad to say goodbye to Rob and the people we'd shared our tour with. I have a feeling too that Rob somewhat conducts his tours based on his passengers and their dynamic, which is brilliant. He is a great judge of his surroundings and instinctively knows what his clients want.When we go back, which I know we will...we'll take a different tour from Cape Convoy again. And if it's not with Rob, as there are other tour guides, we'll also try to arrange having a few beers to catch up with him. He's that kind of guy who leaves an impression! Their whole business did. It's a day in me and my husband's life that we hold close to our hearts, because it - was - truly - special.Thank you Rob and thank you Cape Convoy!"

I wanted a fun and informative tour of Cape Town and after having read the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor I went with Cape Convoy and I\u2019m so happy I did! You\u2019d need a pretty special guide in order to keep my attention for a full day of site seeing and Rob was just the man! He has an abundance of energy (not overbearing), enthusiasm and outstanding knowledge of this beautiful country. He made sure that everyone was looked after, entertained and well informed. He really went above and beyond for a guide and it made all the difference. It was a fantastic day \u2013 not once was I bored!! On my next trip to CT I will be sure to book another tour with Cape Convoy! Thank you Rob"

Considering that they were the number 1 attraction for Cape Town tours, we naturally had very high expectations for it - and our expectations were exceeded! I must say Rob truly made the difference for the tour. We had been on other tours around Africa before coming to Cape Town, our last stop of our travels and I must say that Rob's exuberance, energy and wealth of knowledge was astounding. He kept the group engaged througout the full day trip with stories, information and wonderful insights and opinions. A guide with real heart and soul who takes into consideration every kind of traveller in his entourage. Even the family with a child travelling with us had all her questions answered. What also impressed us was his persona that makes us so comfortable right from the start. Even for an Asian like me, coming from a relatively conservative society, you can't help to feel connected to a tour guide like Rob. His service is impeccable and can be seen in his ability to keep the itinerary flexible and attending to the small things like ensuring we don't get stuck in traffic, making sure we get good pics along the way, picking up nuances in the group like an interest in ostriches and the subsequent unplanned quick stop for ostrich feeding, recommending a lunch point that will not burn a hole in the pocket. His passion just overflows and it is infectious!"

Rob is a real character and made the day fun and interesting from beginning to end. Fantastic scenary etc is a given on these types of tours but what makes them stand out is the tour guides and they don't come much better than Rob! He is not only good fun and enthusiastic but extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the wonderful country of South Africa. If you are looking to do a tour of the Cape Peninula, you shouldn't even consider going with anyone else."

I felt that I must write my first review after our recent trip to Cape Town because Rob and Julius with their differing but equally brilliant styles completely made our holiday! We did 4 trips with them, each one a wonderful experience for the whole family (not always easy to achieve!). Julius took us to the winelands and also shark cage diving. He is unassuming and amusing with a laid back attitude yet with great knowledge of the area (and its wines.....). He tailored the days to suit our interests and could not have been more obliging or accommodating. Rob, who took us to Cape Point, Chapmans Peak, Boulders Bay penguin beach and introduced us to the amazing honey badger is the polar opposite - a bundle of energy who made our time with him unforgettable. He has a wealth of knowledge that he is bursting to share in his inimitable way. He had us laughing all day but we learnt an amazing amount and came away feeling like old friends. The weather played havoc with the plans we had in place on arrival but Rob made sure that we got to do as much as was possible. We will definitely be back to do more with Cape Convoy again - our advice would be to look no further, these guys are the best!"

Not only that, Rob was an absolute barrel of laughs , and so informative, I could not believe how much Rob knew about Cape Town and South Africa. It was amazing! He is a walking, talking ecnycolpedia and history book, without being boring at all, it was great! The way he delivered all the information was so interesting and enjoyable, and not boring at all. Rob took us absolutely everywhere. No stone was left unturned. I could not believe how much we saw in one day and for the amount we paid , it was soooo cheap! Rob genuinely cared about making this day an unforgetable one for us and went out of his way to take us everywhere and anywhere and to please us. I would 100% recommend this tour to anyone and if you miss this tour, it is a great loss! Thank you so much Rob :)"

We found our initial contact with Cape Convoy Tours (CCT) exceptional, every question we emailed to Rob and his lovely wife Liza prior to leaving home was often answered within hours. Any concerns we may have had booking this tour ourselves were quickly diminished by Liza and Rob's reassuring and responsive emails. We started off from Port Elizabeth with CCT picking us up from a private residence and was met by Julius (Jules) who I might add has a great passion for his guide work and South Africa. Jules was extremely informative throughout our entire trip and could not do enough for us.From Port Elizabeth we went to Tsitskamma where we joined the Tsitskamma Canopy Tours swinging our way through the treetops on a flying fox, what a hoot!!! A visit to the Tsitskamma National Park is a must, and the accommodation at the Tsitskamma Lodge was terrific, you would think you were in the Swiss Alps.Day two was Knysna and a guided walk in the Featherbed Nature Reserve. Great view, great meal, a great place to visit.Day 3 we arrived in Oudtshoorn, where we first stopped and visited the Cango Caves, very spectacular. But I must say the highlight for us was a visit to an ostrich farm where Renea managed to have a massage by the local habitants (check the photo). The B&B we stayed at in Oudtshoorn '88 Baron Van Reede Guesthouse' was fantastic and our hosts Zoe & Shaun certainly looked after us.Day 4 we left Oudtshoorn and traversed the country side to make our way to the windy city Cape Town, and boy did the wind blow!!! But what a great place; we stayed the Fire & Ice Hotel in Cape Town, and if its funky you want from your accommodation this is the place.We arranged for a visit two days later with CCT and Jules our faithful tour guide arrived to take us around some of the wineries in Stellenbosch. Jules's love for South Africa is only second to his love for the wine country. Some friendly banter was had about who's country produced the better Cab Sav but we have to admit Jules almost won his argurment. LOL. We will endeavour to get some wine over to you Jules so you can see what you are missing out on. Seriously though, great wine and food to be had in this area. If you get a chance visit Spiers Winery, combine their wines with their treetop dining, patting chetahs, and local music you will be certainly in for a great day.From us to CCT, thankyou so much Liz and Rob for organising a great tour with plenty to see, and to you Jules thank you for making it such a memorable trip. We will be back.Kind RegardsGreg and Renea"

We did both the Cape Peninsula and Wine Region Tours with Cape Convoy and thoroughly enjoyed them both.The Cape Peninsula Tour was run by the irrepressable Rob whose high energy, high octane style whizzes you through the day. He imparts his considerable knowledge of the culture, history and geography of the area in a very interesting manner.We visited Hout Bay - Seal Island, Simons Town and learned about the legendary naval dog Just Nuisance, the penguins at Boulders Beach and finally the nature reserve of Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope where we encountered baboons, elands and ostriches within touching distance along the roadside. The journey both ways included travelling along Chapman's Peak Drive with it's stunning scenery and photo opportunites.It was excellent value for money especially as unlike some other tours all the entrance fees were included in the cost of the tour.The Winelands Tour was equally enjoyable with the more relaxed style of Julius being more suited to the nature of the tour. Julius was a teriific guide with an indepth knowledge of the wines. He tailored the day to suit our tastes, with a nice touch in starting the tour with a champagne/sparkling wine tasting and ending with a wine and chocolate pairing. The 'normal' tastings in between were no less special!We were given options for lunch and chose to spend a couple of hours in Stellenbosch which was ideal and a chance to sober up!As with the Cape Peninsula Tour, all the costs of the tasting were included in the price of the tour.We would thoroughly recommend either/both of these tours. A tip would be to do the Winelands Tour early in your stay so you can take advantage of the very reasonably priced wines to drink back in your hotel."

As a travel agent, I am very careful when booking my own travel products, and like everything else, I shopped around for my tour of the peninsula. First off, Cape Town is an amazing city on it's own; but to miss out on the peninsula and the most south-westernly point of the African continent would be sacrilege. Cape Convoy's Cape peninsula tour provides an in-depth look at so much more than the beautiful scenery, but allows you to really appreciate it on a different level. The rich history and fun facts that Rob includes just keeps your mind racing throughout the tour. Rob's incredible energy and passion is contagious and allows you to feel what he feels... I strongly urge any visitor to Cape town to book the tour of their life, which is Cape Convoy's Cape Peninsula tour... Oh, and if you are an adrenaline junkie, they also offer the very popular Shark Cage Dive; and if you arn't, then they also offer Winelands tours! I learnt so much about South Africa on December 2nd, and I would love to share Rob's knowledge with all. Again, I can't elaborate to which extent i fully enjoyed this tour. Thank you, Rob!"

Although he was always on hand, he wasn\u2019t hovering over your shoulder every two minutes, allowing everyone to enjoy it at their own pace in a laidback atmosphere. During the day we went to several different vineyards, each different, each with its own character and wine style and each of them worthwhile. We were lucky, it was a glorious sunny day, we met and shared the tour with some lovely people (hello Harry and Margery) and everyone came away happy (and slightly drunk!). If you\u2019re over 18, enjoy a good glass of wine, while overlooking rolling mountains, lush farmland and pretty courtyards, then, in my opinion, this is a tour well worth doing."

We scheduled five days in Cape Town, and Cape Convoy was one of the main reasons we loved our time in Cape Town. We arranged a wine tour and a cape point tour for consecutive days. The wine tour, led by Julius and Liza, was amazing. Julius picked us up at our guesthouse on-time and we hopped in very nice and comfortable Cape Convoy van. We visited three wineries in the Stellenbosch region they had picked out for us to enjoy. There was never any rush at the tastings and we were permitted to enjoy ourselves at every stop. The ride between wineries was very enjoyable and Julius was very helpful in describing the complex history of South Africa and the region we were exploring. The highlight of the day was the visit to Waterford Estate. We got a personalized tour and explanation of the wine making and bottling process. The estate itself was gorgeous and offers the possibility for great photos. Besides their great wine, their specialty chocolate cannot be missed. I cannot say enough about Julius and Liza's professionalism, patience, knowledge, and friendliness throughout the day.The cape point tour got off to a problematic start due to the weather. However, Rob was there to save the day. As we eagerly waited Rob's arrival (due to his stellar reviews and demeanor on the phone) we suddenly saw a man in a blue jacket running towards our guesthouse from a few blocks away. He began to wave and shout. It was Rob. He immediately said that the weather would ruin our trip and suggested we reschedule to another day. It wasn't that he didn't want to take us, but rather, the cape point tour is so visually stunning that there is zero chance of enjoyment in such poor weather. He got on the phone and immediately began making moves to get us on the tour the following day (our last day full day in Cape Town) or else offered to give us full refunds. Rob then offered to drive us into town and drop us off so that we could at least enjoy the day sightseeing. The following day, Rob picked us up and led what was very likely the best tour I will ever be on. There is nobody quite like Rob. His enthusiasm and love for South Africa is contagious. His energy sets the tone for the full-day adventure. Rob makes sure that those on his tour leave with at least a very basic understading of key events and moments that have shaped South Africa. This is not simply a sighseeing tour, but a journey in understaing history that the average South African tourist would not be exposed to. It is not all just serious stuff. If you have any sense of humor, your face will hurt from laughing so much at Rob's jokes and stories. Although Rob's voice is plenty loud, try to sit towards the front of the van so that you do not miss a word. Be sure to ask Rob how he feels about Baboons near his van. The tour itself makes stops for a ferry ride to Seal Island, the picturesque Simon's Town, the penguins at Boulder's Beach, before eventually getting to the Cape Point national park. Make sure you go as close as possible to the tip of Cape Point to enjoy the incredible view. Also, be sure to make it down to the shore and listen to Rob's lesson about Pangea and the rocks. On the way back, Rob will take you to Chapman's Peak (with unbelievable timing) for a great sunset over the ocean to cap off the best tour ever.Rob, Liza, and Julius are running the best operation in town. You will not be dissapointed.I will definitely be back to Cape Town and will book a tour with Cape Convoy without hesitation."

We, group of five people, had a great full day tour of Cape peninsula with Rob form Cape Convoy at the end of October. Rob is really amazing guide and everybody from our group was excited and impressed by breathtaking views, complete historical information and friendly atmosphere during the trip. I like wild animals very much and I was happy to see many of them during the tour \u2013 seals, penguins, ostriches, baboons. Rob wanted to be sure that each of us feels well and has a great time. I would recommend Cape Convoy full day Cape point tour for everybody who wants to spend one wonderful day in this beautiful part of the world. Thank you Rob!"

Rob is the coolest - South African born, but spent a lot of his childhood in Essex - the Essex/South African accent is worth the trip alone ;) - no offfence Rob it's a cool accent! We has the best day - saw some breathtaking stuff and Rob fills you in on a lot of South Africa's history on the way in a v impartial way - he really inspired me - we are on honeymoon & came to Mauritius after Cape Town & he inspired me so much so I now have a copy of Mandela's autobiography & The Rise & FAll of Apartheid to read on the beach!!!!!History/politics aside the day is soooo much fun & Rob just wanted us to have the best time & see/do as much as possible. Don't try to do all the sights like Boulders' Bay, cape Point, etc yourself - the tour is well worth it - takes the thinking out of it, you meet loads of new people & make lots of new friends..Thanks for a great day Rob"

My husband and I went to Cape Town as part of our honeymoon and were limited with time here (only 3 full days) - but booked the Cape Point tour with Rob and also booked shark diving for another day. I cannot speak more highly of our Cape Point tour, I am so glad we booked it. We saw so much of Cape Town in that tour, however never felt rushed at all. Rob was so enthusiastic (not at all your typical boring tour guide!). He was very informative and alot of fun, very easy to get along with. He is very comical and a good laugh! Definitely very passionate about Cape Town and its history and you can really tell he loves his job.At the end of the day he also asked us if there were any other places we would like him to take us to, nothing was too much to ask. I would definitely recommend this tour if you are going to Cape Town, you have nothing to pay for on the day (all entry fees to places are included), except for lunch."

Rob is full of energy which helps keep the tour fun and interesting. His love of his country and love of history is amazing as he shares tidbits of Cape Town, South Africa and its culture. He ensured that everyone was comfortable throughout the day and that we got to see the highlights of the Cape Peninsula. I look forward to a return trip to Cape Town and am positive I will be booking another tour with Cape Convoy. Thanks ROB!"

Myself and my wife did the full day Cape Point Tour with Rob from Cape Convoy on 10th Nov.Rob has put together a fantastic tour mixing the most breathtaking scenery with a genuinely engaging introduction to the history of South Africa. It's not like a standard tour, where you are stuck in a coach with a droning guide. Instead you are given an understanding of how South Africa got where it is today, through Rob's enthusiastic explanation. This was all broken up with a boat trip to seal island, penguin viewing at boulders beach, ostriches, dassies, a stunning walk at cape point, and a great photo of my wife running away from a baboon!!Can't recommend Cape Convoy enough!"

I found Rob on Trip Advisor too.

Super highly strongly recommended without reserve!!"

We went on two tours with Cape Convoy: the Cape Point and the Winelands. Cape Point was with Rob, who is incredibly passionate about South African history. We learnt more in one day than we had in history at school. The Winelands was with Julius, who while quieter than Rob, is just as passionate, but about wine! We were incredibly lucky in that it was just the 2 of us with Julius, so the trip was our own, but people in our hotel had a similar experience with a bigger group, asking wine preferences before setting off. There is no set itinerary on either tours, and they are so flexible. This is NOT a boring faceless tour on a coach.The best things about Cape Convoy Tours are that you learn, they're flexibile, they tailor the tours to you, they only take small groups, they are fun and they are incredibly knowledgable in their subject areas.We would recommend them to anyone visiting Cape Town- in fact its a necessity!"

I did the Cape Point tour on a Saturday and Rob picked me up right on the dot. The entire day was filled with breathtaking views, plenty of wildlife (penguins, whales within 10 feet away, ostriches, and baboons). Rob is very passionate about South African history, and by the end of the day we had such a greater knowledge about the beautiful country we were visiting. If you have ever driven through Big Sur in California, the views driving through the coast reminded me a lot of it, but it seemed like everything was even bigger and grander (and you would think I would be bias considering I am from California). Rob really wanted to make sure I saw everything and even woke me up from my little cat nap so that I wouldn't miss the views. I appreciate him doing that since the views were worth staying up for. You can also get a sense that even the locals love Rob, and that he is just not another tour guide. On Monday I had a winelands tour with Julius, and he also picked me up right on time. We had a small group of four (including Julius). Julius genuinely cares about his tours, and is always seeking ways to make his tours better. I have gone to many wine tours around the world (on 5 different continents), and this by far, hands down was the best wine tour I have EVER done. Julius sat with us at every tasting, and even had lunch with us. No wine guide has ever done that before. He had a great knowledge of wine, and made sure we all had a relaxing and pleasant experience. Not only that, he really caters his tours to the wants of the group. It's not a set itinerary like most wine tours, he even gave us an option of where to go for lunch. We got such a variety of tastings, sparkling wine, delicious reds (and I'm not typically a fan of reds), chocolate tastings, old wineries with lots of history, upcoming new wineries, and we even visited a cheetah outreach program to make the trip even more unique. I will recommend Cape Convoy to friends traveling to Cape Town, and I wish Rob and Julius the best of luck with everything!"

Rob, the owner and guide, was super-friendly, engaging and energetic, and we soon felt like part of the family. We were lucky: there were only 3 people in the tour and the weather was perfect. Rob was responsive to our needs and interests, giving us options about how to organize the trip. He gave us tons of history on South Africa, thoughtfully reminding us now and then that he would stop if we weren't interested. The trip included fabulous views, a boat ride and various animals (baboons, a whale, ostriches, seals, penguins). There was nothing at all that we didn't like. Rob's goal was to give his guests a great day and he succeeded 100%."

Not only was Julius very knowledgeable about the area and wine, but I found him to be insightful and interesting when talking about South Africa in general.

Aquila is 90 minutes from Cape Town and once you get there, you are taken in charge by the guides from Aquila. The role of Cape Convoy is to book your reservation, to pick you up at your hotel and to drive you back. At the booking, we received two conflicting emails: One saying we would be picked up at 8:30-9:00, and one saying at 6:00. When I emailed to check the right time, I was told 6:00, and they would confirm the day before. They never confirmed and the driver showed up at 5:20. At that time in the morning, 40 minutes earlier than agreed makes a big difference. Later in the day, a woman joined us: They had forgotten to pick her up in the morning. Since transportation is the main role of Cape Convoy on that tour, they haven't really succeeded. Aquila was nice and according to our expectations. It is not wild Africa, but you see animals in their natural environment and spend a nice day."

This is a bit of a weird review as we didn't actually get to go on the Pennisula tour with Cape Convoy!We read such great reviews about Rob and this tour on trip advisor that we booked to go with them 4 weeks before we set off for SA, the only free date they had was for our last day in Cape Town. On the morning we were due to be collected we received a phonecall from Cape Convoy to say that there had been a mistake and that they had over booked - we were gutted, I was really looking forward to this. I'm not sure what happened but i'm thinking as we were in Camps Bay (last pick up point) they didn't realise they had over booked until that morning when they realised they had another 2 people to collect.Despite this, Cape Convoy really went out of their way and made up for their mistake with the arrangements they made for us; because this was our last day in Cape Town we couldn't go the next day but they arranged for another tour company to pick us up (they were there within 10 minutes) and we did the Pennisula tour with them. Cape convoy also refunded us what we paid, so the tour was on them by way of apology. Not only that but we received lots of apologies via text from Liza during the day, which we really appreciated - afterall, we know that mistakes happen and Liza was really sincere in her apology.The tour is brilliant, all the places that we visited was great - Cape Point, Hout Bay, Chapmans Peak drive - it really is a great day out and we got lovely weather.I hope to return to SA again some day and I will book with Cape Convoy (and confirm my booking nearer the time lol).

We took three trips with Cape Convoy - the winelands tour, Table Mountain/Robben Island, and the Cape Peninsula tour.Table Mountain/Robben Island: I think they have discontinued this tour - it's pretty much a drop off / pick up kind of tour. What made it good for us is that Rob kept a watch on the weather, and got us the tour exactly when it was the best time for it. This is not a small deal in winter, when Cape Town weather is very unpredictable.Winelands: We did this with Julius, who is the perfect fit for this tour - he knows a lot and has some interesting viewpoints about the current events as well. He took us to 5 wineries, as well as downtown Stellenbosch. The wineries were among the best I've seen - I've been to Napa, Sonoma, Anderson Valley, as well as Maipu Valley and Casablanca Valley in Chile.Cape Peninsula: We did this tour with Rob, who's also the perfect fit for this tour. He is literally bursting with historical information that he will impart to you with an enthusiasm that is remarkable, considering that he must be doing this tour quite a few times a week. He was also kind enough to incorporate a diversion so that I could take a photo of some colourful huts I had seen in some magazines and brochures, in Muizenberg. I wish I had the energy he has ...I should also mention Liza, who I unfortunately never met. Because of changing weather, bookings, etc, we had to change our plans several times, and she coordinated everything together with Rob. Eventually, we were able to do everything we wanted with the perfect weather matched to it. Can't ask for more ..."

We loved every minute of our time with Rob at Cape Point and the second day of Cape Town/Table Mountain. We had a diverse group on our Cape Point tour, ages 11 to 70, and wow! Rob had us all enjoying learning about history, apartheid, colonialism. He is just a terrific guide with an enthusiasm about people, his country, learning. We cannot praise him and the experience he provides enough."

            "review": "Excellent. Based on Tripadvisor reviews, we scheduled 4 days with Cape Convoy: Cape Point Day Tour, Big 5 Safari, Shark Diving, and Table Mountain/Robben Island. Because of the weather, we had to move things around so that the 4 planned days turned into 5, but they made it happen and we saw everything. I could not be more impressed. Read all the previous reviews, but I can confirm that the entire experience was excellent. Rob, Liza, and Julius are wonderful people who made us feel like family. When visiting Cape Town, definitely go with Cape Convoy."

We did the cape point tour with him and it was unforgettable. Rob's commentary really added to the beautiful sights we saw. His explanation of the complicated history of South Africa's past was enlightening and engaging. Don't be hesitant to book with this company, you won't be disappointed. Even though our family is usually very quiet we didn't have any trouble fitting in. I love tripadvisor for helping me find people like Rob and experience such amazing things as we did on our trip to South Africa."

            "review": "Wonderful!! Only disappointment was we did not take more tours with them!. My wife and I were in Cape Town for the World Cup, and booked the Cape Peninsula tour with Cape Convoy. We had individual tours through another company for the vineyards and Hermanus, but wanted to get the comraderie of a group tour and picked Cape Convoy based on the glowing TripAdvisor reviews.We could not have been happier with Rob, as our tour guide, and this excursion. While the beauty and history of the country supplied the material, Rob worked magic like a great school teacher weaving the story and bringing the trip to life while we took in breathtaking scenery, in addition to baboons, ostriches, penguins and other friends. Also, the day started out rather wet, and the very low visibility could have easily dampered the trip to Cape Point. Rob's enthusiasm and optimism shined brightly, hoping it would clear up, and it did. Meanwhile he patiently took us around to other sites and admitted he would willingly cut the tour short and offer large refunds, rather than take us to view sites which we would not be able to see if the weather persisted. I was immensely impressed at how earnestly he cared about our total experience.This was easily the best tour I remember ever being on, and as mentioned in the title, my only disappointment was that we had not planned ahead to take other trips (such as shark cage diving, winelands, or safari) through them. As it was near the end of our trip, we did not have time to fit another in. When we go back to Cape Town, this will definitely be a priority."

What more can be said about Cape Convoy Tours than has not already been written in other reviews.Rob Liza and Julius provided me with two tours,Cape Peninsula and the Winelands,and I experienced the best tours I've ever had anywhere where I have travelled.Liza painstakingly not only provided me with fantastic advice and support in relation to my two tours but also rpovided me with advice in relation to my stay at Johannesburg.Nothing was too much trouble for her and her personal interest in dealing with my requests was highly professional and very efficient.Rob is just a human dynamo!It would not have been possible for me to enjoy the exhilirating experiences of the Cape Peninsula tour without his infectious enrhusiasm,incredible local knowledge and obvious passion for the area and his country in general.He successfully made everyone of the group feel inclusive and an acvtive participant.Julius,with his quieter demeanour but wonderful personality guided us through the beautiful Winelands on a magnicent day.Again his knowledge,personality and obvious love of what he does contributed very significantly to an exceptional daylong experience where everyone in the group felt relaxed,happy and enjoying the companionship of their fellow tour member.I may not get back to South Africa but I will never forget the experience of a lifetime that Liza,Rob and Julius kindly created for me,Absolutely a five star operation!!"

            "review": "Excellent - but.... I booked two tours (Cape Point and Winelands) with Cape Convoy after reading the reviews here and had a great time. The only problem was that I *almost* missed the Winelands one... cutting a long story short, I texted the office about 20-25 mins after the pick up time and found out I had been left behind by mistake. However, it was swiftly dealt with and I was soon whisked away to Stellenbosch by the lovely Liza and didn't miss any of the tastings. I considered giving Cape Convoy 4 stars instead of 5 because of it but the matter was solved quickly and the tours were great, so 5 stars it is. Just be sure to text them if something similar happens to you! As other have stated, the Cape Point tour with Rob is a must. I understand he might be \"too much\" for some people but it's hard not to enjoy the sheer enthusiasm he's got for Cape Town and South Africa. Cape Point is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to (if not THE most beautiful) and Rob gives all the background to enjoy the experience in its entirety. The Winelands tour was also very good - just a shame that it was Monday and the Rust en Vrede restaurant (one of the 100 best of the world in 2010) was closed but Julius took us to a very nice restaurant right in the middle of Stellenbosch instead and it was a good chance to see more of the beautiful town.It was quite interesting to be able to compare yang (the force of nature that is Rob Salmon) and yin (cool, calm, collected - and quite gorgeous - Julius)."

            "review": "Probably the best tour company in the world.... Folowing the great reviews we found on trip advisor, we decided to use Cape Convoy when we holidayed in Cape Town during the World Cup. What a great decision!!!!We booked four tours with the company as listed below1. Safari. We were taken by the friendly Des to Aquilla game reserve, two hours from Cape Town. Des was very friendly from the moment we meet her until she had us back to our accomodation.On safri, we were taken out in a jeep and saw close up so many animals, Lions, Elephants, Buffalo, Rhino, Hippos and so many more. The jeep driver made sure we stopped in great positions and was very informative whilst getting us great view/photo points.Once back at the HQ we were able to tuck into a great buffet with something for everyone and beautiful malva pudding and custard.... here started my love affair with the dessert!2. Rob introduces us to the Cape Point Peninsula - day tour. I think Rob must be the most enthusiastic tour guide you will ever meet. He has a great balance of humour with fact and you cannot help but leave the tour wiser with the history of Cape Town, I dont want to spoil it if you havent been but for those who have the phrase '1488, everything is great' will bring the memories flooding back.We saw Baboons, Seals, Penguins not to mention the breathtaking view from Chapmans Peak (a brilliant sunset) and Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope.Do this tour or you will really miss out!3.Shark Diving - as brilliant as it sounds and our first meeting with Julius another friendly tour guide - no exception.We were a little late in going out but that did not matter, they juyst simply brought us back in a little later, making sure we had enough time with the sharks. You get so close to the sharks you could touch them (but dont). They equip you in 7mm wetsuits and diving experience is not needed, you wear a mask and the cage isnt fully submerged. I went in the cage twice and although the cold got the better of me in the end, I had numerous encounters with in excess of five sharks, the biggest of which must have been 4 metres long!The sunset on the trip back was amazing and the only regret I have was not buying the DVD as the photos we took did not do the experience justice.4. Winelands tour.Juilus picked us up to embark on a day of great wine tasting. I am a lover of cheese and so at my request Julius took us to Fairview where we got to sample 8 cheeses and 8 wines. This was a nice start to the day and was good having something to break up the drinking of wine (they also brought out oils and bread). There was a fantastic shop selling oils and cheeses to and a great selection of jams and breads for sale outside - I recommend the chilli jam.We went on to Warwick for another selection of wines before stopping for lunch in Stellenbosch, the name of the place escapes me but the food as always during our time in South Africa was superb value for money.We on to the Cheetah Reserve - nice in itself but not sure if the close encounter is worth the money as you spend no more than five minutes in with it (we were a group of four that paid 100rand each to do this).Our final stop was Waterford which was a selection of 8 great wines, the last 3 served with specially made chocolate and followed by a tour behind the scenes.We tasted several great wines during the day and saw some spectacular views. Even if you are not a big wine drinker the tour is interesting and the views stunning.As you can tell I loved all four tours and the guides really enhnaced the experiences. Use this great company and you wont be disappointed!"

LIza is amazing and does so much to help plan the perfect tour package for you. They are so accommodating and even called us to rearrange a few tours to make sure we had the best weather for everything that we did. Dez, on our way home from the safari, even stopped to help us find a camera shop, so we could buy an underwater camera for our shark dive. You cannot go wrong with any tour that you book with them. Choosing Cape Convoy was the best decision we made about our trip to Cape Town. We loved the Cape Point tour, the safari, Robben Island/Table Mountain, and the Shark Dive. We also heard amazing things about the Wineland tours, but never actually did it ourselves. If you are wanting to learn a lot about the area and have a lot of fun while you do it, do not pass up Cape Convoy. You will not be disappointed!"

Like many other reviewers I am an independent traveller who does not generally like tour parties or escorted groups. I can agree with all the positive comments about this tour. Rob is so enthusiastic about South African history. By the end of the tour I had a real understanding of the whys and wherefores of SAs past. I also heard great jokes saw blagging at its best and had tremendous fun. I really believe I could have had a great time just sat in the minibus listening to Rob without even traveling anywhere. As it happens I was shown some of the most stunning scenery and sights imaginable. I cannot reccomend this highly enough...disorganised at times but thats part of the charm."

My husband and I usually avoid tours because they tend to be boring, inflexible, tiresome at most times with tight little schedules that everyone needs to keep to and being hustled in a hurry from place to place. But with Rob and Cape Convoy, it is a totally different experience..one that we totally relish and love! Rob is simply amazing and passionate about all things Cape Town and South Africa. His extensive knowledge and love for the country just blew us away. He doesn't mind the time too much and leaves a lot of flexiblity of the day's tour to go with the flow of how things turn out as we went along. Fantastic narrative stories and history of the places that we visited kept us entertained as well as broadened our knowledge of Africa. Without the life stories, beautiful sceneries after awhile becomes just beautiful landscapes with no meaning and with Rob, we really felt a connection to the places. Rob's enthusiam and spontaneity is very infectious and we had a great time laughing with everyone on our tour and only 6 of us in all - equally amazing people that made it all more fun. His genuine sincerity in sharing and showing us how stunningly beautiful Cape Town is, is very refreshing and made us feel special - as if he was showing these places for the very first time especially for us, although he must have been there at least a thousand times. We loved that he's always looking out for us and treats us just like his mates and not customers and making sure we were comfortable and having lots of fun at the same time. Cape Point is so stunningly beautiful that it took our breath away and nothing else capped our wonderful tour better than an almost perfectly timed sunset at the most gorgeous place. What a wonderful end to our perfectly amazing day! Thank you again Rob for leaving us with such beautiful and warm memories to last a lifetime. We will always remember that perfect day...Jonathan & Adelle"

The tour of Vineyards with Julius as the guide was a delightful experience as well. The journey in a comfortable mini-bus was deeply relaxing as we drove through beautiful country side. We visited the vineyards of Ernie Ells, Ruste en Vrede and Waterford, each located in a picturesque location. The weather was perfect - light rain playing with sunlight and the air crisp. Ideal weather to enjoy some fine wine. Julius understands and loves wine. His descriptions of the wines helped enhance our experience. He also understands the history of South Africa very well and it was a pleasure to be in his company imbibing great wine as well some lessons in history."

Rob is a fantastic guy who really loves Cape Town and South Africa. He gives you a real glimpse of the Cape Peninsula and covers more ground in 8 hours than you would ever be able to cover yourself. He is extremely knowledgeable about the history and culture that surrounds the whole area and gives it to you from a real, unbiased perspective. His first priority is to make sure you have a great time and he treats all of his guests like family. After our tour on Saturday, he offered to arrange Robben Island and Table Mountain tickets to us for us and to bring us to the mountain the next morning at no charge. His tours are well planned, but also very flexible. He has the ability to adapt the itinerary based on how the group is feeling that day and where everyone wants to spend time the most. For example, even through we had already spent 8 enjoyable hours with him, someone said that they heard Signal Hill was an amazing place to watch the Cape sunset and he immediately headed over that way to provide a memorable end to the day. He's not a clock watcher and doesn't spend his day figuring out which hotels or sites are going to pay him the best commissions. He just wants his guests to have a great time and he accomplishes this well.We shared our tour with 4 other people (strangers) and we had such a good time together that all of us booked their wine trail tour with Julius the following Monday, which was also a great time. Julius is also very knowledgeable about the Cape Town wine region and focuses on bringing his guests to the places that provide the best tasting experience - not which places are going to give him the biggest kickback. On our day out, he basically played the entire itinerary by ear, according to what the group was feeling like on that day. It was a truly enjoyable time.These guys are a not-to-be-missed part of Cape Town, so please make sure you take a day out to spend with them..."

I went to Cape Town in January 2010 (sorry this review is a long time coming, but I did promise Rob that I would write it!!!) for work, with a few spare days to look around. It was my first trip to Cape Town, and as a single female I was a bit apprehensive about traveling around on my own. Cape Convoy were very responsive and helpful with some early email queries I had (even kind enough to call me when it came to booking with my credit card).I chose the two day Cape Town Uncovered Tour, and it was a absolute blast! The tours are very personalised and you travel around in a small group- not like those massive tour groups where there is a leader up the front waving a flag! Rob picked me up from my hotel, along with two other people for the day and went to Robben Island for the ferry and tour. This tour you can book yourself through the website, but it was really nice to have transport there and to hear a bit about what to expect! Following this, we got picked up again and went to Table Mountain- the views of the city are magnificent, and I highly recommend it. The following day was the Cape Point Day tour... and you get a LOT covered in that one day. Beautiful scenery, lovely towns and the trip to Cape of Good Hope was very memorable. One slight dampener though was the trip on the boat to Seal Island- it was rather rough that day and someone got a little seasick (then to sit on a bus for a few hours is a bit uncomfortable)....so if you're susceptible to motion sickness take some tablets! Despite this, we all had a fabulous day and took some very happy memories home. The enthusiasm and energy that Rob shows is remarkable, and it's truly great to have a tour guide who is so obviously passionate about what he does."

I am so glad we booked with them as I really don't think our holiday would have been nearly as good if we hadn't! We first of all went on the Cape Point day tour with Rob.. it was AWESOME! Rob is such an enthusiastic & knowledgable guide, and the group is small so you really get the personal touch. We drove past a few coaches and I just thought we were so lucky to be in such a small, intimate, tour group. We had a lot of fun and by the end of the day I just felt like I was out with a friend (who happened to know a LOT about Cape Town)!! We also went on the wine tour with Julius who, again, was fantastic! We had a brilliant day and yet again at the end of it we had forgotten we were on a tour at all, we were just having a great time! I would definitely recommend both these tours to anyone in a heartbeat!! Both Rob and Julius were so fantastic I really doubt there is anyone better! I wouldn't bother shopping about for prices either as the value for money is amazing!!We also went on the Aquila safari day trip which again we organised through Rob. This was a great day yet again (although the 2 hour bus jouney at 6am was a struggle - don't go hungover!!).I hope we will return to Cape Town again soon and when we do we will definitely go on some more tours with Cape Convoy!"

Rob made sure that we made the most of our time whilst ensuring that our 7 year old daughter was not bored. We converted our Winelands tour into a mixture of Table Mountain, Cheetah experience, and still managed to taste enought wine to keep us very happy, all courttesy of Rob's imagination and desire to ensure that we had a great trip.I would reccommend him to anyone looking for an informal tailor made tour without having to worry about clock watching and keeping up with large parties. Hope to see Rob again soon."

Rob introduced us not only the beautiful South African Sightseeing, but also gave us a great insight perspective into history and life in South Africa.We had the best time in Capetown and neigborhood. Our tours included the winelands (which was for sure one of the most remarkable day in my life), safari, and the city itself of Capetown and its natural sightseeings.I totally recomend Cape Convoy Tours to anyone who is coming from Brazil or anyother part of the world!!"

My wife and I were under the capable hands of Rob from Cape Convoy end of January 2010 and enjoyed 2 days touring the Peninsular Cape, Robben Island (skip if you are not interested in the history of South African independence struggle) and Table Mountains ( a must do if you want to have a panoramic view of Cape Town, food at restaurant also good!). Rob is very knowledgeable about the historic links between the various colonial powers and how they resulted into today's South Africa and Cape Town. He loves talking but for those who love history, it can be fascinating for the listening tourists . Our group of 12 mixed nationalities had a great time seeing the nature's side of the Seal Island and the Penguin colony and the picturesque tour of the various scenic spots/National Reserve Park and Rob seems to keep us amused all the way with historic quiz, social comments, cultural & political insights of the South Africans. All in all, we find Cape Convoy services personable and value for money and we would recommend Rob for any first time visitors to Cape Town."

And finally choose Cape Convoy, we booked the Full day Cape Point Tour and Robben Island/Table Mountain tour. I definately made the correct choice - Rob is your man and he is excellent!!! He is very passionate and knowledgeable about the history of Cape Town/South Africa and has lots of interesting things to tell you as he takes you along the beautiful coastline. I am not going to tell you every place he took us because he took us everywhere you want to see when visiting this beautiful area.Rob picked us up from our hotel and returned us back afterwards, and makes the day very enjoyable. Cape Convoy were very helpful, I can justify this because we were scheduled to visit Table Mountain on the Thursday of our holiday, but sadly the mountain was closed due to high winds, so Rob arranged to meet us the next day to try again\u2026..sadly the winds were still too strong and we could not go. Luckily on the morning of our last day there the sun was out the mountain was clear and the wind had dropped, so he rang us at 8:30 to say \u2018get up the mountain it\u2019s open\u2019. Sadly, he was already pre-booked elsewhere which was understandable (he\u2019s very popular) but he did refund us that part of our payment to go up Table Mountain, which was really nice of them. I can\u2019t recommend Cape Convoy enough, I was so worried about booking a tour before getting there so please if you have any concerns DON\u2019T they are great!

He was also so accomodative and responsive, we were really impressed. Even my husband, who usually does not like tours, totally opened up and had great laughs with Rob. The Table Mountain tour is excellent. Rob picks you up at around 8:30AM, and we picked up 4 other passengers. We got to Table Mountain and Rob let us roam and hike around on our own. Then he took us to vistas where tourists do no go and gave us a history lesson on South Africa. It was great because he offered different perspectives with lovely British humor. We also hired him to give us a personalized City Tour which was really special and great. Rob loves his work and it shows. His enthusiasm was consistent through all our tours. It was so enjoyable and I would highly recommend him to everyone. All the positive reviews are absolutely accurate. In a city where you don't really know what you are going to get, Rob made us feel very safe and free to enjoy the beauty around us."

            "review": "The Best Tour in Cape Town - Read for Details. My sister and I had 3 days in Cape Town and a million and one things we wanted to see. After searching for tour groups on TripAdvisor, I selected Cape Convoy and hoped for the best. Here is our experience:We booked the Wine tour, the Robben Island and Table Mountain tour and the Cape Point tour.A day or two before the trip we received an email from Rob with a tentative schedule. The schedule honestly depends on the weather, and things may get shifted around a bit. For example, it was rainy and windy several of the days we were in Cape Town. This resulted in moving the Wine Tour to a later day.Our first excursion was the Cape Point tour. This tour in particular is given by Rob himself and I highly recommend it. My understanding is that several of the tours are giving by different people working for Cape Convoy. The Wine tour was given by someone else (more on that later). We were picked up from our hotel at around 8.45am by Rob with a full van / mini-bus of people. I think we ended up with at least 8 people from around the world. Rob mentioned that about 70% of the tourists end up being Americans. Our first stop was Hout Bay with about 20 minutes to shop the local vendors and then off on a 30 to 45 minute boat ride to view seal island up close. This was great! We visited Boulders beach which was fun (though I am told Winter is a better season to see the penguins, as most had gone out to forage for food). The majority of our time was spent at Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope. There is a restaurant, however my sister and I purchased some chips and drink from a local vendor and instead used our time to hike out the light keepers trail to the furthest point and then take a second hike out to Cape of Good hope. Each hike is no more than 1 to 2 miles, though given the time you may need to jog portions of it. Rob peppered the trip with interesting history and facts about South Africa, Cape Town and the various locations we were visiting. This trip alone was well worth the money.Our second day was the Wine Tour. The tour is given by another guy (forgot his name) that runs his own tour company. Rob mentioned that he doesn't do the Wine Tours himself. I have seen a few people complain about this tour, and can sort of see where they are coming from.  We had a great time on this trip. I attribute this to the fact that we more direct with our guide as to where we wanted to visit, and what we wanted to do. There are some 100+ estates in the Cape Region, and I guarantee you that everyone will have different tastes.  For example: We first visited Durbanville Estates which was alright. From this point on, we asked our guide to take us to Estates with a little more character, featuring sweeter wines and possible side attractions. And because of this, we had a great day! We asked our guide tons of questions and non were left unanswered. To be honest, after about 4 estates, each serving 8 glasses; we had each had our fill for a while. Our favorites were Solms Delta, with their fusion wines and Vrede en Lust for the spectacular views (and great wines!). We also spent about and hour and a half in Stellenbosch having lunch and shopping at Oom Samie se Winkel; the oldest store in Stellenbosch. Its definitely worth a short visit! We purchased about 4 bottles, with the top vintages going for around $10!!!!!!!!! You can purchase a bottle and pay an uncorking fee of around $5 to $7 at local restaurants to serve with your meal. To finish the day we wanted to see some animals. There are two estates right next to each other that offer such a treat. The one that we visited had the cheetah's. It cost R5 to enter and about R95 I think to pet them. I was content with taking photo's through the cage and walking around. The estate next door had white lions. Sadly the last tour of the lions is at 5pm, and we missed it by about 10 minutes; so instead we sampled 4 of their wines to conclude our day. If interested in the white lion tour (which runs around $10), be there by no later than 4.45pm.To be honest, if you didn't have a good time on the Wine Tour; I think its your own fault. My recommendation is to let the guide know up front what types of estates and wines you are interested in, ask lots of questions, and enjoy the day.Sadly we were unable to enjoy our third day on Robben Island or Table Mountain. Rain and windy weather forced the cable car to shut down and the island ferry to close as well. We did not plan for bad weather and thus did not have any additional days with which to be flexible. My advice for future travelers is to book about 3 or 4 extra days in case of bad weather. This will allow any tour groups to reschedule for better weather. There is plenty to see and do on your off days though. We spent at least a day or two shopping at the waterfront, visiting museums and various landmarks.Rob did refund us for the day we were unable to take. I will definitely look up Cape Convoy when next travelling to Cape Town and highly recommend them as a tour group. If unsure about anything, email Rob and i'm sure he'll be more than happy to help you out."

I had booked Cape Convoy as a result of reports on Trip Advisor and I was not disappointed. Having spent the previous few days on an organsised trip of the Garden Route with a different company (whose guide treated us like school children) it was wonderful to meet such a friendly, obliging and fun tour guide as Rob. The first day we went to Robben Island and Table Mountain with a lovely young English couple. Everyone was so relaxed and friendly and we ended up meeting them for a drink that evening. The second day we did the trip to Cape Point/Cape of Good Hope/Boulder Beach etc. in a group of seven. Rob is so relaxed that he helps everyone to get to know each other and that makes the trip so much more enjoyable. The day was magical - from the boat trip to see the seals off Hoet Bay to beautiful Boulder Beach and the adorable penguins to Cape Point. Rob is very obliging and willing to go with the group's wishes, i.e. if someone wants to stop for a photo all you have to do is ask and it is no problem.. He was flexible with the time and you never felt as if you were being rushed along - we had as much time as we wanted at each stop. My friend spent a third day with Cape Convoy on the shark diving trip (I was too much of a coward to try that but, having seen the video of her day, was rather sorry I had missed another fantastic trip). Rob's love of Cape Town and South Africa in general shines through on his trips. He is informative and very entertaining - a really nice guy and, at the end of the two days, was like an old friend. We had a most wonderful holiday in South Africa and my one regret is that we had not done the Garden Route tour with Cape Convoy instead of the other operator.I hope to return to Cape Town in the next few years and, when I do, I will certainly be booking more trips with Rob."

We stopped at Spier for lunch at Moyo and to see the cheatahs. We weren't told about the cost of lunch and had to wait 45 minutes for the bill. I feel our guide could have done more on this occasion to ensure we get value for money on the tour. After settling the bill we needed to wait another 10 minutes while the guide spoke to some friends.We were then taken to a club in Camps Bay which was a nice surprise but again had to wait for the guide to finish socialising. I personally would recommend a self drive day tour around the region to fit more into your day."

We went to South Africa at the end Nov/ early Dec. starting in Pretoria, staying at the Sheraton Hotel, taking the Blue Train to Cape Town, staying at the Table Bay and using Cape Convoy (tour guide) to show us around Cape Town. See separate reviews for these. The trip was arranged by Natalie with Best at Travel in London, who did a fantastic job arranging the tailored trip for us and at a price we were happy with \u2013 I would really recommend Natalie, she gave us some really good advice. We spent 4 days with Rob at Cape Convoy doing Cape Point, Robben Island, Wine Tour and Big 5 safari. Rob by far was the best tour guide we have ever had, and we\u2019ve experience quite a few in our time. I would describe Rob as an expert Tour Guide, historian, philosopher, geologist, comedian, match maker, business man and the list would on and on, but most importantly a friend. I was a little sceptical about all the review I read but if you are thinking about any of the tours Rob offers then don\u2019t even bother looking elsewhere \u2013 Cape Convoy is the best. We learnt so much about Cape Town in such a fun way. On all 4 of the tours we met some interesting people, but more importantly Rob has this gift of bringing everyone together and by the end of the day all become good friends. Some advice: Take something warm and waterproof for the Cape Point tour, and the sun can burn so use sun block. Don\u2019t bother driving to the Wine Lands \u2013 we bumped into a few people who took the car and the driver could not drink, and if he/ she if part of your group it really does not make it a party atmosphere, again with Rob, we all became good friends and the help of some wine it all happened at the first Vineyard!. You can book the Robben Island and Table Mountain trip yourself and you\u2019ll save yourself a few pounds, but don\u2019t bother because Rob gives you some good advice on both tours which you won\u2019t get going on your own and it\u2019s worth it.

We only booked the Cape Peninsula and Robben Island/Table Mountain day tours but such was Rob's determination to ensure we received value for money by seeing all that we had paid for, we actually saw him on four different days. Despite the unpredictable weather we managed to visit Roben Island and Table Mountain, albeit not on the planned days. Our fortune in doing this was emphasised when we met other couples in the hotel who, using other operators, had failed to visit these sights because of unfavourable weather with no alternative being offered. Rob's tours are relatively informal but that doesn't stop you feeling a VIP as he directs all of his attention and enthusiasm into ensuring you fully understand the culture, history and beauty of his country. We are well-travelled and we have never been provided with such a comprehensive and willing tour package. We would strongly recommend Rob to any Cape Town visitors."

We went on the Wine tour and Cape Point tour with Rob and the Robben Island experience and Township tour.First of all, these tours are really good value, particularly the 2-day explore capetown package.The Winelands tour centred on Stellenbosch and included stops at some amazing vineyards (apparently not all frequented by the larger tour operators). The Ernie Els vineyard was a particular highlight; other than our party (4 people) there was nobody else there and we had the opulent surroundings to ourselves! We also got the chance to visit a cheetah sanctuary and paid a small supplement there to stroke the cheetah.The Robben Island tour was largely operated by the Robben Island people but we were picked up by Rob on the day.The Township tour was interesting and we visited a 'witchdoctor' and local kindergarten funded by tour operators. There was also a visit to the district six museum on this tour. This does obviously bring you up close with the poorer areas and deprivation in Cape Town and perhaps isn't for everyone as a result.The Cape point tour was brilliant. It was a day packed with so much - a boat trip, numerous historic sites, penguins, the Cape of Good Hope, Hout Bay. Fantastic. Rob is a great guide - great knowledge but also able to weave a really good historical picture and above all willing to go the extra mile for guests. The tour is in a minivan and there were never more than six of us in total on any of the tours.Thanks for a great time and memories to keep for a long time"

He picked us up at the agreed time, but the weather was not immediately accomodating. He then altered the schedule and we went to those sights that would be good assuming the weather cleared up. Along the way, he pointed out the important sights, engaged us in enthusiastic and interesting conversation and informed us of great inside information about the entire area. He didn't push us to hurry, or suggest that we might not want to spend time in a particular area. Because the early morning weather was not good, he reduced his normal price because he didn't take us to what he usually does. All 4 of us thoroughly enjoyed his tour and company and we would readily recommend him to others."

Cape Convoy is a very personal and friendly outfit. There was 6 of us on the trip and the tours seem to range from about 2 to 6 people (8 max) as normal. Rob is very enthusiastic and great fun. He is full of interesting info about Cape Town and South Africa. He also offered plenty of advice on a wineland tour which we did on our own as Rob obviously had other things booked up for the rest of our time in Cape Town. He also did his best to try and arrange a Shark diving trip for us with no incentive for him but just cos he's a great bloke.He comes highly recommended and is great value for money."

Rob (the owner, driver, entertainer, and now friend) bent over backwards for our family to ensure our seven days with him would be memorable and amazing -- and boy did he deliver! Rob devised a unique tour that set his tour company apart from the rest in that he catered his tour to meet the satisfaction of us, his customers. If a tour is closed due to weather or if the customers are just not so interested in the place - he changes the tour right on the spot to accommodate his customers and ensure their happiness, even if he loses money in the process, Cape Convoy will move mountains to make sure you - the valued customer - is happy. Regardless the reason or cost. It was just amazing to be treated like royalty and like such a valued and important part of Cape Convoy's day. We had an INCREDIBLE and memorable time while in Cape Town and it was all because of Cape Convoy. Thank you Cape Convoy and thank you Rob for everything! We miss you and appreciate all you did for us during our time there. We would not hesitate for a second to recommend this great tour company to anyone else and have already done so numerous times. Just amazing! You will leave Cape Town with a great background knowledge of Rob's beloved city as well as with a new family friend. We are happy to supply photos and/or more information on request.

Being a 1st timer to Cape Town, tedious research were carried out in order to have the ultimate enjoyment in Cape Town and boy we got so many choices of tour agencies to choose from. Only after stumbling upon Cape Convoy, plus it's overwhelming reviews we decided to put our safety to them. We took the Cape Point tour (2 days visiting major attractions) at a reasonable price as compared to other agencies. It was winter and on our 1st day, only 2 couples (including ourselves) were in the group. The other couple was this lovely husband & wife from England. The whole journey was a thoroughly enjoyable experience with wonderful attractions visited, extremely breathtaking views, enriching conversations shared and whole lot of jokes and laughter throughout the journey !!On our 2nd day, we were supposed to visit Robben Island and Table Mountain but we only managed to visit Robben Island due to weather conditions. However it was well taken care of by the good company of Cape Convoy :)All in all, we love South Africa & Cape Town and we truly apprecaite the experiences shared by Rob of Cape Convoy ! It was truly memorable ! This visit to the country has totally changed our mindset about South Africa as we found out that the people are warm, very hospitable, down to earth and safety was not an issue for us. From us in Singapore ... thank you Rob !!Imran & Fizah"

I decided to return to SA to have my wedding in Durban, and also planned a surprise honeymoon for my bride to be in cape town for a few days as well. My only problem was.... that i couldn't find an extensive tour of the fair cape within a reasonable budget within the short time frame i was going to be there. Thank god for Cape Convoy and more so to you Mr Rob Salmon. Of all of my trips in Europe, i have never come across a tour guide who has such a personalised and positive approach to his work. He was extremely accommodating and has such a wonderful energy about him that made this guided experience anything but some of the boring, scripted tours that i've been on in other countries. Besides the guided tour, on our first day we enquired about any seafood restarurants he'd recommend, to which he off his planned route and dropped us off at no extra charge at Ocean View in Camps Bay. My wife and I had the perfect start to our honeymoon watching the sunset whilst dining on the best seafood in the cape. Needless to say we had a fantastic honeymoon, and on our next trip to South Africa will definitely be returning to the Cape to try out the Shark Cage diving that Rob mentioned. All of the best to you Rob and may your business go from strength to strength!! Your friends, Prean & Anneline (12th May 2009)"

Anyone who has not make the journey to Cape Town yet should def make the effort, you will find it very hard to meet someone who has been here who will not tell you it's one of the most stunning places on earth!I am from London but am based in joberg for a few years and my wife and I took a holiday to Cape Town and stayed in the fantastic Fire & Ice Hotel, 3 star and only R500 per night.I was recommended a tour company by some friends of mine from New Mexico that run their tours in open top Land Rovers. They are called Cape Convoy and the day tours done in safari style and have 360 degree views so you can really get a feel for the Cape.Our day tour took us to Seal Island, Boulders Beach witch is the home of the African Jackass Penguin, Kirstenbosh Gardens, Cape Point (where the 2 Oceans meet) The Cape of Good Hope, and the Ostrich farm. All in one day! We also were given a good few hours at Cape Point, we were informed that with a lot of companies, 45 mins is the norm but that\u2019s not enough. Those of us who felt up to it walked all the way to the end of the point, the edge of Africa!It was simply the most fun we have ever had on a day tour, our driver Roger was a star and what a character! We learnt a lot, made new friends and had a blast. I have never seen a company that do the Day Tours this way, the Land Rovers were converted to seat 7-8 people and the views from the back were incredible. It beats a mini bus hands down!Another aspect of Cape Town we really enjoyed was Robben Island. The tour lasted 4 hours and was hosted by an ex \u2013political prisoner. We also found and amazing sea food restaurant in Camps Bay called Ocean View, eating wonderful food, watching the sun go down with a cocktail. It\u2019s as good as it gets!"

Highly recommend this tour - we visited four wine estates with about six tastings at each, with a bit of brandy thrown in and a full glass of wine over lunch..!

We even threw in a quick stop at a strawberry farm shop. The tour was recommended to me by a local Capetonian as she'd been on it herself - so I do think this is the very best wine tour you can do! It was both fun and informative. We were very lucky to have James as our guide as he was great fun, interesting and very knowledgeable. 5/5 - the only thing I can think of to improve it and make it even more awesome, for the awkward ones of us, is to forewarn the restaurant/wine estates if you have someone with dietary requirements. I had emailed before that I was vegan and reassured that that would be accommodated but this hadn't been communicated to my guide/the restaurants etc. Couldn't eat the cheese and chocolate (these could be easily supplemented) during the day and didn't know if the wines were vegan. But had a very merry day indeed - thanks so much!"

There was just the 4 of us so it was flexible and he asked us what types of wine we liked/didn't like to tailor the tour around us. We went to 4 places and each was very impressive with lots of very good wines to try. No pressure anywhere to buy but we picked up a few bottles as it's so cheap. We went to a fantastic place for lunch which I think is the usual place. Big hearty dishes (needed after drinking from 10am!) and a good range of options (inc veg and a local dish - the meal was as good as anything we had in top restaurants in town and inc in the price). Good commentary from Willem through the day and a thoroughly enjoyable day out at good value in my opinion. Would highly recommend."

Bruce wants everyone to feel comfortable with him and others on the tour. The wineries we went to were all fantastic (exceptional wine) and not too busy. He had designed the route so there was no long queues or waiting. Lunch was lovely. I could go on for ages saying how good this tour is. I would strongly strongly recommend to anyone who likes wine, cheese, food and the company of other like minded people."

Jimmy, our guide, was very well-informed, yet never too serious or pedantic - so our small group had a great time moving from one estate to the other, learning a thing or two along the way about the history of viticulture in the Cape region as well as some basic techniques of tasting and appreciating the wine. We visited estates in Stellenbosch, Franschhoek and Paarl, driving through some amazing landscapes and stopping for a lovely lunch break at Le Pommier in Stellenbocsh. We were quite wobbly on the walk back to our hotel room at the end of the day, but that was a welcome side-effect of a most enjoyable day. Would highly recommend an African Story tour to anyone discovering the Cape Winelands for the first time."

I cannot speak for the other guide leaders, but what I can say is that Bruce, our guide, was brillant! He knew his stuff, looked after us well and gave everyone time. For sure this little excursion into the wine lands worked out well because of Bruce's interaction with his clients. He even laughs at his own jokes, which is a bonus because no one else did..

Would be better to do this kind of trip by your car with your own planing and pick vineyards you want to visit.

It was a neat mixture of people and all were friendly. They picked us up at our hotel. We went to 3 different regions and 4 different stops...all of which were a reasonable short drive from Cape Town and each other. The guide was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. The wineries were all very friendly. Even the one stop where we didn't have a group wine tasting did a free tasting for me and my bf when we asked. You can buy at the different stops. The guide had to foresight to provide a cooler for those that purchased cheese at the first stop. My bf and I love to buy wine and they were very accommodating to help us fit it back on the van.

I was a bit nervous as I had to reach out and get confirmation the day before the tour to make sure it was still on and confirm where we were to be picked up, but after they responded it was perfect! Nothing to worry about.Our guide, Paul was right on time (even a bit early), and was such a nice guy. He was so knowledgeable about Cape Town and all of the wine regions we visited. The drive was about 35 minutes to the first winery - not bad at all! The tour lasts all day long, but is so worth it. We went to 4 WINERIES overall! Each had about 6 tastings at each- all which were delicious. Lunch was even included (which was really lovely!) For the price, this was an absolute steal. Great wine + great food + great people + great guide = GREAT EXPERIENCE. My husband and I were extremely pleased. Just book it, you won't regret it! Thanks African Story!"

Before leaving for South Africa, we searched on the net and amongst a raft of tours, found this tour company.I was a bit worried because it was nearly half the price of the company which we had previously used and even lunch was included.Booking was a simple matter and Bruce, the owner, driver and guide arrived exactly at the time promised.We picked up an American couple and 5 young ladies from Canada. Together with the 4 of us, it made a party of 11. Everyone seemed relaxed and we all got on well together which added to the pleasantness of the day.Bruce proved a perfect host, very knowlegeable, relaxed and friendly.We started at Fairview estate, then on to Backsberg before calling at Le Pomier for an excellent lunch.The afternoon saw us visiting another 2 estates before heading back to Camps Bay.There was a fantastic range of white and red wines as well as sparkling and a rose. The tour also included cheese tasting at Fairview, something not included by other tour companies.The whole day was exceptional and we cannot praise and thank Bruce enough.Oh, and before I forget, as it was my wife's birthday, there was a bottle of wine for her from Bruce. A nice touch.If you have any doubt about who to use for your wine tour, I can highly recommend this company."

Bruce however accommodated our late booking with no problems and promptly turned up the next morning! We had a great group (Hi to Ali and Marissa from the U.S student cruise!), Bruce was great and a genuinely very nice person. Started sampling wines at Fairviews at 10am! And by 5pm, we had gone to 4-5 wine farms and had sampled more than 25 wines (with a lovely lunch of bobotie in between!)! All the wine farms chosen were different with stunning settings, and we even got to sample cheese, port, chocolate and olive oil on the side. No pressure to buy anything either, but it was so good, did end up bringing 4 bottles safely to the UK ;) It was one of the highlights of our SA trip and would love to do it again. Totally worth the price too!"

A friend in DC recommended African Story Tours when I mentioned I was interested in doing a winelands tour when I was in Cape Town, and I'm really glad I followed up on his suggestion. Our charming and knowledgeable guide, Richard, took our merry little group (me from the States, and some folks from Switzerland, Germany, and Finland) to four wine estates over the course of the day, several of which dated from the mid-1600s: Fairview and Spice Route estates in Paarl, Anura in Klapmuts (near Stellenbosch), and Solms-Delta in Franschhoek. The stops included wine tastings, informative presentations, and winemaking tours with the vintners at each estate; cheese tastings; a great lunch; chocolate; and awesome scenery, from the vineyards themselves, to the wild ostriches and springboks on the farms, to the backdrop of the Groot Drakenstein mountains. Kudos to Bruce, the owner of the company, who even came to our rescue at the end of the day when a couple of us went out to dinner after the tour and one of our group had forgotten his cell phone in the tour vehicle: Bruce not only delivered the phone to its owner, but he also gave me a ride back to my hotel, even though it was late in the evening and well after our tour had ended.African Story Tours is highly recommended!"

We communicated with Bruce who was very happy to answer the many questions we posed, and we decided that we would actually like to do a Private tour . We are a family of 5 , with 20 something 'kids' and with Bruce's help we tailored our own route. Bruce had even thought to bring along a cool box in case we made any purchases or had water with us on a hot and sunny day, small things that we hadn't thought of! He was extremely knowledgeable, made the transitions in and out if the wineries very smooth and was good fun along the way! We even got to see the grapes at Villieria going through the wine making process courtesy of Bruce! I could go on, but just try African Story yourself, you won't be disappointed and we would highly recommend to any one contemplating like ourselves!"

After doing research on TripAdvisor, we settled on African Story for our wine tour because it felt a little more balanced between fun and maturity than some tours out there. Interestingly the group the day of our tour ended up being really young (we were the oldest, I think, at 31 and 30!) but not at all wild, and we had a great time exploring four different wineries with our fellow travelers under Bruce's wing.Bruce knows a lot about the region and wine, but didn't explain too too much about either, instead choosing to give us lots of time at the four vineyards we visited for tasting and exploring. We spent ample time at each and were able to get to every spot on his list \u2014 with a side trip to a yummy biltong spot! \u2014 without ever feeling rushed. The lunch spot he brought us to was delicious, too. I'd definitely recommend this tour to people who are looking for a fun day (maybe not so much if you're looking to learn every detail of winemaking) \u2014 we really enjoyed ourselves."

I just went on this tour yesterday with three friends and it was by far one of my favorite things I have done over the month I have been in South Africa! Our guide was Bruce and he was AMAZING. His amount of wine knowledge was incredible and he was extremely kind. He also had a great sense of humor. To top that off we went to four different wineries and each one is very distinct. The wine was spectacular as was the cheese, chocolate, and brandy! The lunch included was also awesome. If you are looking for great value and a wonderful time, then look no further than African Story Wine Tours and request Bruce! In California wine country we have nothing close to this great of value."

She was a fantastic (I repeat myselft with good reason here) tour guide, driver and a representative of the people of Cape Town. We loved the tour too :). There were only 5 people on this tour, me and my spouse and 3 older (very fit) Australians. I think this made for a better experience than if there had been more people.Ferne came to pick us up at our hotel at the designated time, and we were off to the East to Stellenbosch, Paarl and Franschhoek. We visited 4 wineries in total , and had a lot of delicious wine with olives and cheese. I unreservedly recommend this group for touring the winelands of the Western Cape."

The owner and my guide for this full-day wine tour Bruce Storey, gave me a perspective on wine and cheese I hadn't had before. We visited four outstanding wine farms during the 10-hour trip with generous tastings at each, and were highly entertained by Bruce's description of the surrounding countryside, wine and life in general. I highly recommend anyone to spend a day with this outstanding tour company, especially if you're a wine lover and even if you're not - you will see the most spectacular scenery South Africa has to offer, and it's very reasonably priced. When Bruce realized I had no idea what Biltong was, he made a detour to a local hole-in-the-wall which in his opinion, had the best around. He even introduced me to Ginger Beer....he's a character and so much fun to spend a day with.....highly, highly recommended."

Each wine land is very different: cheese tasting, olives, Brandy's, chocolates and of course wide selections of wines. The drive throughout the day is stunning also. Do not miss the opportunity to purchase some great foods and wines at Fairview- very good value.Thanks again for 3 very enjoyable days Bruce! I will be back.Phil London, UK"

The upside - we were the only people on the tour, so we had an entire vehicle to ourselves! What a treat, we felt like the whole day was a private affair customized for us. We tasted a delicious variety of whites, reds and MCCs and brought home the maximum allotted in our luggage (two each). The downside - we were really looking forward to the unconventional addition of the brandy tasting, which was not included into our itinerary, and were told we would tour a barrel cellar which we did not get to do. I would have also loved to have driven through the beautiful town of Franschhoek, although I'm not sure if that was possible given the tight schedule of the day. Overall, a great experience!"

When doing the standard tour all tastings and meal are included however this is not the case with the private tour. I was advised in advance to collect a kitty of 200 rand pp (apx \u00a310pp) I wasn't sure this would be enough for everything we did, and was shocked when we ended up with money left over.

We had a wonderful time especially because our guide, Fern, was so lovely and made everybody feel at ease. The atmosphere was really relaxed; we never felt pressured by time or to buy anything. We tasted lots of different wines and champagnes but also olives, cheese and chocolate. We don't know much about wine but Fern was giving lots of explanations. We also visited a cellar. The landscapes were really amazing. I really liked the fact that we visited two sustainable farms. We would highly recommend this tour (unless you want very technical explanations about the wines)."

The van we drove in was very comfortable, and the people working at the wineries we stopped at were all very nice and knew Bruce; the winery with the cheese tasting was a favorite, as was another where we tasted chocolate as well as brandy (not together).

Fern was a real delight - incredibly knowledgeable, extremely engaging and responsive and a whole heap of fun. Her commentary and communication with the group made this a trip well beyond the ordinary. The selection of wineries and the order in which we visited them was simply superb. Champagne to start and the heavier wines to end the day. Olives just when we needed a snack, lunch perfectly timed and cheese late in the day to both complement and soak up the wines. This really is a trip above and beyond and a great way to see Stellenbosch as well. Thank you Bruce and Fern. You're doing an excellent job.Thanks to my travelling buddies as well. Lovely to spend the day with you."

He showed up on time at my hotel, warned me I was the only client and off we went for a very memorable day of visiting 4 wineries and a fine restaurant. Bruce is very knowledgeable in a subtle way giving a lot of information without making one feel naive. My best day of a 5 day visit to the Cape."

He took us to four different wine farms; each with its own unique feel. The wines we tasted were varied and really showed the level of winemaking in South Africa. Bruce displayed an amazing knowledge of his home nation. We learned history, sociology and politics.It was a special 50th anniversary trip for us. Bruce made it more special (including a gift bottle of sauvignon Bland from Villiera winery).The price of the full day tour was very reasonable - better than other tour companies we checked out. Lunch was great too!If you want a great day in the Cape Town region, this is the one."

Not only did I learn about SA wine, but was also exposed to the culture and history of this great nation. Our guide was well versed and passionate - a great combination. The wineries themselves were very interesting, but the experience went beyond this. One of the ladies in our group was celebrating a birthday and he arranged to have a cake brought out during our lunch (the food here was fantastic - more than I expected for the price we paid). In addition he let one of the wineries know and they gave her a birthday bottle as a free gift. I booked the trip through another group (wine desk), but would certainly book direct on my next trip. If you want to learn more about wine in an informal atmosphere at a very reasonable rate, then this is the way to do it."

This company was recommended to me by a couple I met on a safari tour, so I looked them up online and found them to be quickly responsive and very informative. I booked with them without any problems. They were right on time to pick me up (unlike one of the other local tour companies). The tour was a mix of young and middle-aged tourists of a wide variety of nationalities, some in couples, some solo travellers like myself and some pairs of friends. They give you a nice view of the Cape dutch architecture of Stellenbosch and then went to 4 different wineries over the course of the full-day tour, which also included lunch. I never felt rushed. The price was more competitive than the larger tour companies and it included more wineries as well as lunch. The lunch had quite a few options and was delicious and included another choice of wine with it. The wineries varied between small and large across Stellenbosch, Franshoek and Paarl, and even included a cheese tasting at one of them. And since I had spoken to the other couple about their tour, I realized that they change the wineries they go to between tours as well--you could probably go more than once and get 8 different winery experiences. The guide was very knowledgable and friendly. One of the tourists in the group unfortunately had her ATM card taken by a machine in a scam, and he spent a lot of his free time on the tour trying to help her correct the situation. For service and price, this was easily the best tour experience I had in South Africa. The only downside is that they don't have credit card services."

My wife & I did a full day wine tour to Stellenbosch with Bruce on New Year's Eve 2012, which also happened to be my birthday.From the moment he picked us up right on time in his mini-bus from our hotel, he made us feel at home with him & the other guests on the bus. He launched straight into stories about Cape Town, rugby & of course his love of the winelands. He loves playing the tunes straight away to get the mood going & loves telling jokes, all of which kicked the day of very well.We went to 4 vineyards all up (plus a brandy farm as I said I liked brandy), with each of them diverse & excellent. Bruce has an amazing knowledge of everything drinkable, but has the knack of explaining it very simply to punters like us so we know what we are drinking, how to enjoy it more, what foods to eat with etc. He does it all with great humour & stories from his own past & stories he has heard from other places. Once the wine started flowing, the full group of 16 started to get very merry & it was only 10.30am.Lunch was excellent & Bruce took it upon himself to spoil me by organising my own sticky date pudding complete with candles & an Irish coffee. He also bought me a couple of bottles of sparkling to enjoy that evening: all off his own account & not organised by my wife.The day was absolutely brilliant & Bruce is the best wine tour guide we have ever had. Great bloke who loves wines, good times & good rugby banter with an Aussie. It was sad to get off the bus at 5.30pm, as we met some great people on the bus & Bruce ensured the fun never stopped.All up this guy is THE man: don't bother going anywhere else, Bruce is on the mark & his prices are very reasonable also.See you next time we are in Stellenbosch Brucey."

Bruce definitely knows a lot about wines but he also loves them and it shows. During the day we went to 4 vineyards and the wife was very happy with the quality of the wines.

If you are looking for an unpretentious relaxed wine tour that enables you to sample the capes wines without having to purchase the whole bottle to find out if you like it or not this is definitely the trip for you.Even before we booked this wine tour we knew we had found a tour company who were genuine jewels in a rare crown!During the initial enquiry and booking Bruce made us feel like nothing was to much trouble even when my phone was switched off he found a way to contact us with the pick up times and details.With a family of four ( Uni student and a much younger teenager) we did not hold out much hope that a wine tour would appeal to all of us. However, us adults, although not huge wine lovers, felt we could not come to SA without sampling the regions delights.As soon as we met our guide Ferne, we knew we were all going to have a fabulous day, within minutes of her warm enthusiastic welcome she made us realise that you do not have to be an expert to taste wine and even if you do not manage taste something you like, \u00a0you\u00a0would have still had a lovely day out viewing the beautiful wineland scenery.We visited four very different estates during the day. From the first estate our youngest at 13 is now an aspiring MCC expert and has fallen in love with Merlot, the estate dog not the wine! The second estate had a more modern boutique feeling with a large welcoming open fire. where we purchase some very fine olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our third estate was where we stopped for a wonderful relaxing lunch and in my opinion tasted and then brought the most exquisite sparking red wine. The food and service was superb and according to our eldest it was a steak well worth waiting for. Our youngest had her own private tour of the estates 'Narnia' with our guide while we enjoyed tasting even more of the sparking red and some of their experimental wines. Our last estate gave us the opportunity to try a variety cheeses along with our wines and for me a badly needed coffee!\u00a0Also thanks \u00a0to our guides excellent choice of 'road tunes'. I am now a firm Goldfish fan with my own CD and t shirt!!From our last minute booking to the help of booking a trip to see the penguins with another tour company, African Tours gave the whole family a day to remember with so much more than the first class service they deliver."

James was great in providing all kinds of information about the winelands, wines themselves and regional history. Great lunch out on the patio of one of the vineyards (though the steak is v tender, I'd suggest taking the fish/lighter option so you don't clonk out immediately post lunch). Of the four vineyards we visited, especially enjoyed Villeria, Tokara + Fairview."

Our guide, Miranda, was amazing, the four wineries were brilliant and felt like we learnt loads about wine, while totally enjoying ourselves and trying dozens of new flavours. Also learnt how to drink brandy without it burning your mouth :) I didn't know anything about wine before going on the tour (you don't have to) and if you do have some knowledge this day tour will enhance it. If you're looking for a fun, unforgettable and brilliant day out in Cape Town - this is it! A wine tour wasn't part of our original 'list of things to do in Cape Town' but this was so worth doing and was worth every precious rand. Don't miss out!"

This tour was absolutely amazing!!!I contacted the owner Bruce the day before our tour and in no time he got back to us and arranged pickup from Camps Bay and booking details. He also confirmed that this wasn't a \"smelling and spitting\" tour but more of a \"drink and drink\" some more tour :-)The next day (my Birthday) Bruce arrived on time with a birthday badge in hand and we collected fellow tourers on the way with him doing the introductions so everybody got on well right from the start. At Cape Town we met our excellence guide James before spending our time at 4 great vineyards tasting a lot of wine and great cheese at the end. Included was the best lunch and pick the steak if u like meat, u won't be disappointed!!! James was really casual allowing you to learn as little or as much as you want and giving the local grown knowledge of the areas we visited. This tour is cheeper than its competition and is exactly the trip to go on during you holiday!!! Thank you Bruce and James for the best of memorys on my Birthday."

Four different wineries, cheese tasting and an amazing lunch are all included for less than other wine tours in the area! They pick you up and drop you off right at the door of wherever you are staying, have good music on the ride, and great explanations along the way. A great deal! Since then I have sent all of my friends and family who have come to visit me in CT on this tour and every single one of them RAVE about it as well. I also went back for a second time in Dec 2011 and it was as fun as the first time! Among myself, my friends, and family we have had a few different guides and everyone is great. Definitely not to be missed while in Cape Town!"

The wine estates we visited were really good ones and everything was well taken care off. Oh and the lunch was very good at a very nice restaurant in the wine region.

We visited 4 vineyards with approx 1 hour drive to the first one, then approx 15 mins drive between each off the stops and then an hour back to Cape Town. We'd all had such a great time together we decided to go for a drink together in the evening and our guide was more than happy to drop us off at a different location from the morning pick up points.I would certainly recommend an African Story wine tour to any friends visiting Cape Town."

I phoned Bruce on his mobile around 630am the day we wanted to get on the tour. He pretty much told me there was no way but I managed to convince him we could get dropped off at the first stop-Fairview Winery in Paarl. It was unbelievable we had a great crew of South Africans and an older couple from Australia. Bruce told stories all day about apartheid, his days as a clown and general knowledge of South African culture. At the second stop Solms Delta, where we had lunch, the head sommelier Leon, a Xhosan dude told cool stories about the history associated with the name of each wine. Bruce even took a small detour at the end of the day to drop us at the Drostdy in Stellenbosch. I was a bit tanked by the the end of the day but it was a fantastic tour and likely the best of 20 days in SA. Even better than the golf or the lions. First Rate."

Our tour guides (Isaac and Maudi) were really great, especially Maudi always made us laugh and told us lots of interesting stories about the country - even though we were probably not the \"easiest\" group, being just girls and 13 (!) of them. The landscape was great and there were lots of really great activities (zip-lining, hiking in Tsitsikamma NP, canoeing, whale watching and my personal highlights, the sunrise game drive in Addo NP and surfing in Jeffreys Bay!). Even if it was somtimes a bit rushed, our guides managed to make basically every activity possible. Most of the backpackers we stayed in were amazing, too! The only downside of the tour for me was the group of travellers - they were nice, but on my tour we were only girls, most of them German and except for one all of them really young (I know it's always a bit of luck and due to advertising and stuff there are always many young travellers that come from different volunteering projects, but as I did another tour right after this one, I just really felt the difference). Nonetheless I would definitely recommend the tour and Hotspots2C if you don't mind this."

Also impressive, Mordy had an eye for detail: He was very organised so we never had to rush, he commanded us when we were entering the caves to not wear jumpers as it is boiling underground (very good choice) and he even went to the effort of making sure the windows were spotless so we could have a great view of the landscape driving.

You will have the opportunity to try new foods, go wine tasting, play with varying South African Animals from cheetahs to elephants to ostriches, and overall have a fascinating and engaging exploration of life in South Africa. If you want to tour South Africa, whether you are a couple or a group of friends or of any age, this is the tour for you to do."

            "review": "If you are contemplating this tour- DO IT!!! Garden Route & Winelands (7 days). First, let me just say this is the best trip I've ever done, and I have traveled quite a bit. Isaac is the most charismatic, wonderful tour guide, and we had the pleasure of also traveling with Maudi, who was driving a separate group. They are so knowledgeable, organized, thorough, and fun. These two are so genuine and made everything amazing. In addition, my husband and I decided to backpack for our honeymoon, and we both agree it was the best thing we could have done. Isaac made sure that he pampered us where he could, which was so unnecessary, but so so appreciated. He was professional but also genuinely cared about each of us. The vans were new and always clean, with a/c and heat. Our tour had about 14 people in it, but they split it up into two vans so that there was plenty of room and personalization. I didn't feel like I was on a tour group, but instead with a group of travelers from around the world and different age groups, who soon became fast friends. I haven't done a formal multi day tour before, so I wasn't sure about it when booking, but I can't say enough about the quality of the vendors and events. My past experience with day tours was often to places where the tours had a relationship with the vendor, no matter how cheap the quality, and I felt forced to buy/ take part in what they were selling. This was NOTHING like that. Isaac and Maudi clearly have good relationships with each accommodation and experience because the vendors are professional and these two guides are fantastic people. Isaac still always had our opinions and best interests in mind, and even went into a restaurant he loved and frequently visits, and calmly explained to a waiter when he thought the waiter had screwed up and over charged us at one point. Our only regret is that we didn't see there was an 8 day tour that also did Cape of Good Hope, but Isaac helped hook us up with an additional tour to get there, even though it was a competitor's, because they could fit into our schedule and budget before we flew out. He went above and beyond for us, all the time.Every day we were in awe- it just kept getting better.We also chose to stay in a private room in the hostels, and I honestly think that while the 4 stars looked nice when we dropped off others on our tours, we had the best location for every place, often right on the beach (with the exception of Stellenbosch, I'd maybe try to upgrade on that location if they would let you for location's sake)... If you are ever going to contemplate shark diving, bungee jumping, walking with elephants, climbing through crevices in a cave... I can go on... I hadn't before, but this trip (kindly) pushed me to my limits, and we couldn't be happier we did it all. We were heartbroken when it ended. It is so hard to pick out a favorite part, and looking back, I can't believe how much we accomplished in 7 days! It went by so quickly because we were always doing something. I will be highly recommending this tour, and especially with Isaac and Maudi, to everyone I know interested in South Africa. I can't remember the last time I laughed and smiled so much! We talked it over, and there isn't anything we would change. We started out with amazing tour guides and ended with friends. Thank you! - 1 and a Half Hours from ChicagoPS: If you end up touring with Isaac, make sure you have a lot of Madonna on your Itunes. He loves Madonna. :)"

My guides were Isaac and Maudi, and they are some of the most amazing people I have ever met. They really do care about everyone who they guide the tours for - extra special care and attention to detail is why I enjoyed the whole tour so much. I wish I had spent more time with Maudi, because you could see how much he loved making people happy and it really stuck out for me when he got champagne and cake and gave another person on my tour the most southern birthday party in Africa! I spent more time with Isaac which I am very grateful for. Isaac does it all without asking for thanks or credit which is why I almost didn't notice how much extra care he was putting in. But I'm glad I did notice because I realised how inspirational he is and he has given me a boost of confidence which I can't thank him enough for. He made me feel the most comfortable and myself that I have ever felt. Shame he couldn't beat me at pool though! But I'll be back soon, so maybe he can give it another go then. Hotspots2C are a great company and I would definitely do another tour with them if I am back in South Africa. What sets Hotspots apart from other tour companies is they really are giving the best possible service they can, whilst juggling time schedules around and organising everything for you so you can sit back and relax knowing everything is sorted for you. Sit back or jump off the worlds tallest bungee bridge - I'll take the second every day! They do all their hard work with warm and friendly smiles on there faces - I miss you guys! Keep up the good work! Peace out. Jimmy"

Joined this tour at the last minute based on solid reviews here, a very transparent website with clear pricing, and quick follow up on the part of Belinda who handles bookings. I was traveling solo, female, early 40's. The tour included a mix of younger and older travelers with most of the older opting the 3* guesthouses. Good choice for me since the hostels were definitely more of a party scene. Our guide Ulrich was an absolute pleasure to travel with, very easygoing, happy to answer lots of questions, a great driver, and really well liked by every place we stopped. They greeted him like a dear friend at every stop, including the elephants! The 4-day, 3-night option was perfect for my schedule but 5 days would have made more sense considering the amount of driving. Choose that if you have the time, but the shorter one was also really great. Nothing but good things to say about HotSpots2c. I'm really happy that I took the leap in booking with them!"

Lion is confined to small area. But the guide, Marco, for that game drive was very good. He added lot of character into all the animals we saw and lot other interesting information on animals.1 day Cape peninsula tour was good. Covered many places in one day.

            "review": "Excellent Experience. I did two tours with Hotspots2C, one three day WoW and one five day Garden Tour with two different guides (Isaac and Kevin). This is my first time in S. Africa and I am traveling by myself. It is a great way to see the country for the first time and covers a lot \"cannot miss\" or \"must see\" spots. From the get go the staff was very prompt and helpful in answering my questions and supporting me making payments. Both tour guides are very friendly and fun to be around with. My impression is that they are quite knowledgeable. Isaac was my tour guide for the three day tour and he also led the 5 day tour in parallel with mine. Issac helped to break the ice with such a wonderful sense of humor. On the 5 day tour I sat next to Kevin in the front and asked millions questions and he was always happy to answer my questions and have a conversation just about anything. For those who enjoy more outdoor activities Kevin is THE guide to have. The relationships that they try to establish with the travelers felt genuine and personal (vs just business). I personally felt like that I left the tours with two friends in Cape Town and would hope to see them again at some point. I am also happy with the accommodation options they provided to me. Normally I would have liked to do my own research and pick the place but given this is a tour structure and I was not able to. The owners at the B&B places (I picked 3 star option) are very friendly and accommodating. Their hospitality made my stay very enjoyable and pleasant. I have been on tours in other countries and what I particularly appreciate about them and these tours is that there were opportunities set up to help the fellow travelers to bond and to know each other. I had a great time interacting with fellow travelers from all over the world. The only reason that I did not give 5 star rating is that there is not much flexibility in picking and choosing the destination and activities. For those who have done safaris in national parks in Kenya and/or Tanzania you might be disappointed with what you might not get to see in Addo. With that said it is always luck of draw on what you get to see. I also understand that it is a standard tour. For those who wish to have a more tailored experience the agency also offers private tours. After the 8 day tour If I were to come back to S. Africa I would do a private and tailored tour."

We ended up having two guides, Izaac for the vineyards and Maudi for the garden route. Both were great and made sure we were properly settled in and happy with our accommodations.There is a good amount of time spent traveling on the road, but there's no other way to really see everything. Most activities were included and there was no real push for the ones that weren't. We were free to participate or not. The only downside of the trip is there is not much free time to explore the locations and most nights, we are just dropped off at the B&B for sleep and not much else. Overall, a great experience as we saw a lot of South Africa for very little, just wish that they offered a longer tour, so we could have a bit more free time to explore some of the wonderful locations."

I had more than enough possibilities to pictures, but unfortunately we spent a lot of time in the car and did not have enough time to explore the places we stopped either. The guide was really nice and tried to answer all the questions we had concerning the trip. Aditionally he spoiled us with some sweets and ice cream during the trip. The backpackers that were chosen for the nights were cool, especially the one in Cape Agulhas because it is very close to the sea so that we could go for a quick swim in the Indian Ocean. All in all I would really recommend this tour for everyone who does not have lots of time or wants to get a quick overview of the region."

Our tour guide, Isaac, was very friendly and loved to joke around with us. There was high tension as we had a very difficult individual in our tour who wanted all of the activities catered to his every whim (wanted Isaac to be his personal chauffeur, complained that he wasn't allowed to ride the elephants or ostriches, even though it's well-known that these activities are cruel to the animals, to give a few examples) and Isaac made sure this person had a minimal negative impact on the rest of us. Overall a great five days with (mostly) awesome people in an absolutely beautiful part of South Africa - I would highly recommend!"

We could get around on our own, take taxis etc. What I did not appreciate is how INDISPENSABLE it would be. To explain, the first day, we went to Table Mountain. Our (excellent) guide, Maudy, drove us there, accompanied us up to the top, and then set us loose for an hour and a half. So I'm thinking, \"did we really need a guide?\" But when it was time to leave, I realized when he left us, he went and started holding our place in line for the descent. He waited an hour and a half in line for us . . . so we did not have to. People were jealous to see us skip the whole line, but hey, have you ever heard of the concept of \"business class\"? Not having to wait in line for an hour and a half was worth every penny. The next day, we had Divan as our guide, and again, just having someone there to facilitate everything for you, drop you off right at the spot while they go search for a parking place, pick you up front and center when you're ready to go . . . having this service really saved our whole trip."

Steph, our awesome and knowledgeable tour guide, drove us and about 8 other people up to the private reserve and was super cool about telling us all about South Africa on the way. (The running joke for the rest of the trip for my friend and me was that everything we knew about SA we had learned on safari).We saw all of the animals we could ever hope to see on the private reserve, we took a million pictures, and we really felt we had gotten our money's worth. She took us all to have ostrich braai for dinner, which was definitely an experience (other food options were available too) and the next day we went to the Canga Wildlife Ranch, an elephant walk, and a tour of an ostrich farm. Each part was unbelievably fun and interactive and worth every penny. Elephant walk was by far one of our favorite parts, but the wildlife ranch was awesome because we got to play with lemurs and baby cheetahs (the really interactive parts you had to pay for, but because the US dollar is so strong right now it wasn't a big deal for us at all to shell out an extra 20 bucks here and there to actually play with some African animals). Overall, my friend and I agree this was by far the BEST 2 days of our entire trip and we would totally use hotspots2c again for other tours. This was super fun, informative, active and exciting, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to get a taste of Africa in a short amount of time."

After having two days of pre-cruise tours in and around Cape Town, I was pleased that Hotspots2c were willing to work out a tour for my wife and I on the last day our ship was back in port that would let us cover the spots that the cruise tours had not covered. Our private full day tour of Table Top Mountain and then down the coastal road to the Cape of Good Hope was wonderful. We were able to book a half day tour the next day as we disembarked the ship and then to our flight, seeing the aquarium and botanical gardens on the way.It was our good luck to have Ulrich Damon assigned as our guide. What a wonderful, friendly, informative,an warm young man. Best of luck to him in his dream of Olympic competition.J Kuehnle USA"

It's certainly a well organized package that has a diverse array of activities. I was quite pleased with the guest houses that we stayed at as they were in close proximity (i.e. one could walk or take a taxi) to local restaurants. My group consisted of only four persons and thus our tour was more personalized. Xenni (our local guide) was absolutely fantastic as an ambassador for his country. He certainly made every effort to ensure that his clients were well taken care of. South Africa is a beautiful country and if I were to return, I'd definitely contact Hotspots2c!"

Highlights included the bungee jumping (go for it), the elephant bush walk, the Addo safari drive, and the beautiful beaches of Jeffrey's Bay. It wasn't on the optional list of activities, but crocodile cage diving at the conservation park ranch was also fantastic, as was getting the opportunity to see and pet a cheetah up close.Our guide Kevin was a legend - he always went out of his way to make sure everyone had a great time. We were lucky to have him join us for dinner and post-dinner drinks every evening where he shared lots of great stories and history. We all agreed he was one the best tour guides we've ever had. The hostels were all excellent, great food, locations, and evening socializing. I went for the single rooms which were great. We had a pretty special group indeed...after 5 days in a van together we arrived back in Cape Town and all went out for dinner followed by Karaoke. We definitely have the amazing tour and our guide to thank for making it such a special week."

Ulrich was an excellent guide - I will say that it was nice we had the same guide for the whole time, he mentioned usually the 3 day and 5 day tours have different guides. If you are trying to choose between the 3 or 4 star guesthouses - CHOOSE THE 4 STAR!! The guesthouses were great - and most were oceanview/oceanfront! (just be warned you may be the only one at the 4 star but I was fine with that - Ulrich would pick me up for dinner so you aren't alone all night - and even was nice enough to make a separate trip for me the night I wanted to stay out later w the others at the hostel!The 3 day cape part was spent seeing lots of the famous sights and the garden route combined lots of activities (zip lining, \"adventure cave tours\", safari, canoeing, etc) with amazing views. Be warned the garden route is quite a bit of driving but thanks to frequent stops it wasn't unbearable. The people definitely helped make this trip great but even if you don't hit it off with people it is still one of the most beautiful places I've ever been!I usually don't do tours but for cape town and the southern cape this was perfect! I'd highly recommend Hotspots!"

The tour itself offers a little bit of everything and I really liked the mixture of activities. You will see beautiful sunsets, landscapes, ocean views, you will walk through stunning nature, meet animals, visit farms, have some beach and shopping time, have some adventure time when you actually have to get on your knees and dirty or \"fly\" and evenings are either yours or social - you choose.

Big G, our guide for the first three days, made the trip very enjoyable and told us all interesting facts about the Western Cape and was always willing to answer our questions. We, a full bus of young German girls and one English/Dutch guy, visited Cape Point, Hout Bay, we watched wales in Hermanus and took pictures at the most southern tip of Africa. A wine tasting in the amazing wine area as well as a walking tour through the township were also excellent experiences. The stop at the penguin resort is a must. The hostels and the places to eat were always very good. Thank you Big G for this perfect start. Two of us spent the last night of this first part in a lovely hostel in Cape Town city where Zaahid, our tour guide for the next five days, picked us up. We were a very nice small group of five people. In the following days we walked with lions, canoed in the Wilderness, watched a huge herd of elephants in the Addo Park and visited an ostrich farm and the Cango Caves. These are just a few of our fantastic stops. All the hostels were perfect and we spent there very enjoyable evenings. Zaahid is a real gentleman, open-minded, has a great sense of humor, is a good story teller and became a really good friend. From the first moment he integrated every single person into the group and took care that everyone is happy at any time. He always stopped for some pictures at a nice viewpoint and explained a lot about SA and the culture. Thank you so much Zaahid for this unforgettable time\u2026.I think without your help I would have never gone over the bungy bridge and would have missed this amazing experience.I can only complain about one thing \u2013 eight days were too little ;-)I will never forget these days.

Our guide Isaac was fantastic. Adjectives that I would use to describe him are - very knowledgeable, kind, professional, funny, intelligent, prompt, patient, excellent driver, experienced and a 100% amazing person. We enjoyed everything so much. The accommodations were perfect, the activities were a lot of fun and the group was really nice. I even got to symbolically \"adopt\" a cheetah, which is something I will cherish forever. The only thing I had an issue with was the ostrich farm, which I perceived as a cruel and unhappy environment for the birds. This one part just made me sad. Perhaps you may wish to consider another site to visit during this tour. It seemed to me that many folks in our group were saddened by the conditions of the birds as most have huge bald spots where they had ripped out their own feathers due to boredom and frustration - information which the ostrich farm tour guide volunteered himself. Even if they are farm animals they do deserve much more respect in my opinion. I left quite angry and it took a while to calm down. We were really not the only ones who felt this way. But besides this everything else was absolutely wonderful. A big thank you to Isaac, especially for sharing your stories with us and for taking such good care of our group. We will definitely be back for another tour soon. Thank you Hotspots."

It was not clear on booking that if we chose guesthouse accommodation that we would be seperate from the majority of the group who were staying in shared accommodation. This meant the tour guide had to drive us to and from our accommodation to be with the group for the evening and meals, which was sometimes miles out the way (not fair on them when they have been driving all day and need to rest and we want to socialise). We were happy to stay with the group we would have just preferred a private room and bathroom, which wasn't an option on booking. The guesthouse accommodation (which we just thought would be a private room on booking) was satisfactory but not worth what we paid and this let us down.

We went to three different wineries and we started with the best first, Ernie Ells. What a spectacular piece of property and the wines were delicious. The person assisting with the tasting had such a passion for the wines that it showed in every description he gave. We also stopped at two other wineries. One paired their wines with sorbets and the other with dried/cured meats. A whole day event but the time goes quickly. Even the drive from Cape Town was interesting since our driver Gerhard was quite knowledgeable and shared lots of tidbit and fun facts about the regions. He was easy going and laid back and never made us feel rushed throughout the entire day!"

I stayed in the backpackers at night and it was awesome!! braai every night, really good mood and great evening/ nights there with stunning sunrise and sunset (shoutout to the beach @afrovibe backpacker in Sedgefield) Special review for my tour guide Zaahid aka Z very patient and always ready to share his knowledge about history, places and funny stories !

I visited South Africa for five days with work and decided to spend the three nights i had to myself in Cape Town. First of all - the most amazing city I have ever visited !I was picked up on time and after picking up the other people, we set off along the beautifully scenic garden route stopping off to do a 4x4 safari for a couple of hours and then do a lion walk. The lion walk was the highlight of the tour. Walking with the kings of the jungle is just something I will never forget. An overnight stop in Oudtshoorn (pronounced 'oates-urgh-in') in a comfortable family run b&b was done then the ostrich farm, elephant ride (amazing also) and then the wildlife ranch followed before arriving back at my hotel for 6.30pm.Everything mentioned in the itinary was done and for the price, is something i would recommend to everyone. Truly unforgettable and a great way to see the sights outside of the city; which are breath taking.Finally, a special mention to the tour guide Andrew. A top bloke who made sure everyone was ok. Didn't intervene and allowed people to get on with what they wanted to do. I was on my own and he made me feel very welcome. Deserved the big tip I gave him. If you read this mate, again, it was awesome to meet you."

Also stay at the back packers hostels! I made the mistake of booking private 3 star option and they weren't even nicer than the hostels! Also, I was under the impression that I would be in a private hotel room since I upgraded but the 3 star accommodation is in someone's actual home! I felt awkward showing up to their house late and ended up staying the the back packers lodge. Definitely request Isaac and do the lion walk and 4x4 game drive!! So content with this trip!"

We had Andrew as our tour guide and he did a great job! He was very knowledgeable about the areas and was able to answer most of our questions, plus he paid attention to what we interested in and was accommodating (for instance, he would pull over at lookout points whenever he noticed us intrigued by the scenery, without us having to ask or would suggest alternatives such as zip-lining over bungy jumping). There was more time driving than we had anticipated, but because the scenery was so breathtaking, we didn't really mind. The accommodations were very nice (B&B's, clean and comfortable with good breakfasts!). Overall, we had the trip of a lifetime, and this tour helped make that happen!"

I have been waiting to go to a country where I could do this. This was the highlight on my trip.Day 3 Addo Elephant National Park. I was picked up at 4:00 AM to be driven to the park. We went for a 2 hour game ride in a 4x4 vehicle. It looked a lot like an army truck. It was an open truck with a roof and very cold. We were given a poncho. Some people even had blankets. It was so much fun looking for and finding elephants, zebras, flightless dung beetle, and other animals. The African zebras have brown stripes and are very pretty. Took lots of pictures.Day 4 - Rode an Ostrich at the Ostrich Farm. So much fun and went to the Cango caves.

'Z' demonstrated professionalism and a level of cultural sensitivity which gave rise to a strong bond amongst the other tourists (from different countries) which was something I appreciated. He was very knowledgable of the regions we toured, and encouraged questions and dialogue around the culture of SA. Lastly, Zaahid's mission from the start was to have us enjoy every waking moment of the trip, and encouraged us to step out of our comfort zones. Thank you 'Z'! You the man. Second, the trip itself was fantastic. From being picked up on day one, to taking in the beautiful scenery, bungee jumping, riding elephants, speaking to natives, walking with lions, to being dropped off on day three, Spots2c has done a wonderful job coordinating and executing this tour. The trip was done very efficiently and professionally. They pick you up, you load your luggage which is kept locked in a trailer, and you explore South Africa to see phenomenal views, learn about the history and culture and enjoy some adventurous activities. If you're looking for a way to your South Africa, hotspots2c would be the choice, and they offer a variety of packages and durations. Already looking forward to my return to SA."

It reminded us that what you do is important, but doing it with friendly and good people makes it so much more memorable. Zaahid is a great tour guide who works in mysterious ways. The activities were so much fun and enjoyable. The Cango caves tour was interesting... Overall we hated the experience and we hope never to do this again, Zaahid. Just kidding, we had such a great time and we would recommend this tour to anyone looking for a fun filled African experience!Greets, Sophie (England) and Dino (Holland)"

My favourite travel quote for the most surreal and most amazing experience I had.I joined a 2day Wildlife + Safari tour with Hotspots2c, after counting down the days to my tour it was finally here. Zaahid was our tour guide,and he immediately made you feel welcomed and got us all very excited for our trip which lay ahead. Our first taste of adventure was a 4x4 Game Drive, in the most spectacular game reserve. We were able to see so many wild animals in their natural habitat as well as get a friendly 'hello' by a Giraffe passing by. Next was Walking with lions, I have no idea how to describe how amazing this was, other then the experience was so surreal. From here, we headed to our Backpacker accommodation where we spent the night, and what a fun, lively place it was.We were up bright and early for a wonderful breakfast and then we headed to the elephants, this was my favorite part of the tour!! these animals are so loveable and even showed us how they can even kick a football! At the Cango Wildlife Ranch I got to touch a cheetah and Lemars and go cage dive with the crocs, it was incredible being so close to these wild animals. All in the all this was the most amazing tour, and i was able to tick so many things off my bucket list !"

            "review": "5 Day Garden Route + Addo = Incredible!. This tour was great & our tour guide Gerhard was AMAZING!My husband and I took this tour because a friend recommended it and we were so happy we did. It covered so many beautiful places along the Garden Route. We opted for the 4 star B&B stay though we were debating the 3 star v 4 star. The company recommended 4 star because of a night at Buffelsdrift. Well, we didn't know what any of this meant but we took their advice and were so happy! Our accommodations each night were incredible, to say the least. We slept so well and felt like each day was its own mini-vacation in a new part of the country at a new, adorable B&B. And Buffelsdrift was out of this world awesome. It was the best night of our entire 2.5 week trip to South Africa. The tent we stayed in was gorgeous - nicer than the tents we stayed in at our 5 day safari a week later! We saw tons of animals come right to our front door!But, back to Gerhard. He made our trip perfect. He went out of his way to make us comfortable and happy all day, every day. He made reservations for us, drove us to special places/restaurants, and stopped whenever we wanted to see something along the way. Though we paid for the extra safari drive at Addo, our drive through afterward with Gerhard in the van was EVEN BETTER! I know it doesn't make sense that seeing animals from a van could be better than seeing animals from a safari truck but it was better because Gerhard made it so much fun. We went what felt like everywhere in the park with him and saw so many animals. He helped us take pictures and get close to so many great animals.Overall, we'd highly recommend this tour to anyone traveling - as long as you understand it's ideally designed for a younger crowd of backpackers (at least our van was) but we found the value was incredible, the sites were selected perfectly, the accommodations couldn't have been better, and Gerhard made it extraspecial. Thank you Gerhard!!"

We had Zaheed who led this road trip and made it informative and fun! Zaheer - always in control of the drive also made you feel the spirit of Africa - we learnt a few local words and shared many a laughs en route this picturesque journey! My favourite was Jeffreys bay, the canoeing down the wilderness and definitely the trip to ADDO! Although we missed the early morning Safari - the nature gods made up for it - there was an exquisite show of wild animals in their natural habitat and leading them were the elephants - we just loved the sights and sounds of the nature reserve. being our honeymoon - Hotspots arranged a special night at a private game reserve - this was the icing on the cake and made such a difference to our trip. I liked the fact that the trip was not packed with activities - it had its share of adventure but also ample time for relaxation! Keep it up Hotspots!"

Drive back, albeit a long drive (but plenty of stops incl Ronnies for Milkshakes) was spectacular. Gerhard was very friendly and knowledgeable and really went out of our way to make sure everyone was looked after. He was organised and had lunch and dinner preordered on our first day. We stayed in 3 star accom as we didn't know how great the backpackers hostel was and we upgraded to the guest house. Wish we stayed at the backpackers as it seemed great fun. Gerhard kindly arranged for us to eat at the hostel with the group (amazing BBQ) and Gerhard dropped us back to our accommodation! If you want a 2 day trip down the garden route to go on safari- do this! It's great value and was the highlight of our South African holiday! There are extras if you wish to pay (loin walk, elephant feeding, various cango encounters etc). We did some as it's a once in a lifetime experience! Please pass on our compliments to Gerhard!"

Very thoughtful of all of his guests. We saw a majority of the animals on the safari part. Granted it was in a game reserve, it was still fun. Our guide for the 4 x4 did not offer blankets and we all were frozen so if you are going out on this be sure to dress warm. And I mean warm! It is spring and we still froze. Saw lions, rhinos,giraffes,zebras, ostrich and their babies. Wasn't too happy with this guide but overall, this part was good. The accommodations we had at a bAnd b were perfect. Walking distance to sweet little restaurant called nostalgia. Delicious food. The only drawback there was no wifi at B and B so we couldn't check our iPad pics.The second day of safari was fun! Started with elephant walk. Again, Isaac was helpful! That was my favorite part! Then we went to a animal reserve. A great second day.. We also walked with the lions and that was amazing but scary. My friend did a cheetah meet and liked it.Overall, I enjoyed it and we stopped at Ronnie's sex shop for burgers and chips on way back. Get your cameras ready.

Also loved the road kill cafe & town we visited at very beginning of tour. Both hostels had a wicked vibe - defo return to both!!Experiences were all brilliant & even though the 4x4 was cancelled at one location due to bad weather.. Other alternatives were given to the group which was very good!!! (Not mentioning being stuck in mud hahaha) Fun & games.

I booked two of the Hotspots2c tours during my visit to Capetown .... their 3-day Western Cape WOW tour and their 2-day Wildlife and Safari. I loved them both! Inexpensive, yet completely memorable! The WOW tour made stops in Hout Bay, Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope, Stellenbosch for wine tastings at two wineries, Cape Agulhas, Hermanus, and Betty's Bay (to see the penguin colony). A tour of the Kayamandi Township and Chapman's Peak Drive were included, as well as the (optional) opportunity to go shark cage diving or whale-watching. Talk about seeing everything in one tour! The Wildlife and Safari tour drove the famous Route 62 and included a mini 4x4 big 5 game drive on a wildlife reserve, time at the Cango Ostrich Farm and Wildlife Ranch with opportunities to interact with various animals, an elephant ride at an elephant rescue reserve, and a lion walk. Again, so many unique, memorable experiences all in one weekend!If/when we return to South Africa, I won't hesitate to book tour with Hotspot2c again!!!"

Always something to do or something beautiful to see. With hotspots2c you will never get bored and you will make memories and friends wherever you go. Too bad the ten days passed so quickly :( I would highly recomend this to anyone who is open to new adventures in a relaxed and professional way! Not only will you get to see all there is to see in South, you'll be doing it the best way and with the best guide and driver. Xenny is amazing, happiest, funniest, and simply the best driver+guide you could ever ask for! A vacation I'll remember forever! :)"

What a great guy Xenny is, an excellent guide, friendly and enthusiastic, he really looked after us all, nothing was too much to ask of him.We headed out to Oudtshoorn after collecting everyone for the tour, it took about six hours drive from Cape Town but Xenny allowed plenty of stops for us. We managed to pack so much into the 2 days \u2013 but the highlights for us were the elephant experience, lion walk and the 2 hour safari game drive. We also paid extra and stayed in a game lodge for the night instead of the hostel which really added to the experience.The tour was excellent value for money and brilliant at ticking everything off what we wanted to see on our trip, we would definitely recommend using this company, but please note it is aimed more for the younger backpackers/volunteers as it is very active."

We were picked up from our hotel with baggage and generous welcomed and treated well during the trip, even during our visit to the ostrich farm I started to feel bad and Mr. Z drove me to a pharmacy after dropping the others and our bags to the backpackers. the route was great we did all that we expected to do in South Africa in a short time period; safari, bungee jumping, sight seeing, getting close to the animals, Canoeing in a beautiful river with a short swim. We were older than the rest of our traveling companions in our late thirties and Mr. Z made sure we were part of the group at all times and kept us all in good spirits thought out the trip talking and answering questions at correct times whilst keeping quiet when the travel required, his driving skills were very useful specially around some of the crazy drivers, he never put our lives in danger and always had time for stop break or a quick sightseeing moment.Hotspots 2 c organized accommodation passes and lunches in quality places with great landscapes and history for us to gain many photos of our dream holiday. We recommend hotspots tours If you visit the Cape and the garden route. Thanks to this tour we did all we expected to do and more in our travel to South Africa, we think that if we would not did this tour our experience there would be lost to booking accommodation, organizing cars and routes and it would be stress and tiring from drivingKind regards,Derek and Eva"

He was very attentive to our needs. While at an ATM he stepped in and protected us from some very sketchy people who got to close while we were using it. He made sure we were safe at our hostel/guesthouse every night. If he wasn't able to take us back to our lodging at night (because we liked staying out late for dinner) he made sure we had a way to get back safely. The guesthouses/lodgings were clean, safe and comfortable. In some, the views were beautiful! Breakfasts were standard. Eggs cooked to your preference, a variety of cereals and yogurt, lots of fruits. The staff, at the majority of the places, made us feel welcome and at home.Maudi promised that we would see elephants after our very disappointing 0600 game drive. We were all skeptical. He drove back into the park in our tour van and lo and behold!! We saw tons of elephants, buffalo, kudu, dung beetles, and mongooses.He also knows lots of good places to eat. One night we requested ostrich for dinner. He made arrangements and we had delicious ostrich kebabs and sausages!Every day was an adventure!!! We couldn't decide which one we liked most each day. :) There was also lots of down time to rest and relax. I definitely recommend hotspots2c to anyone wanting to see South Africa and experience some memorable adventures!"

One of the good things I like about them is they let you choose the type of accommodation you want! If you have more money to spend you could stay at a 3 or 4 stars guesthouse. If you are on a tighter budget like me you can choose to stay at a backpacker. They really have a good choice of accommodations! The backpacker I stayed at was awesome! Very clean and tidy! The other good thing about them is they have good tour guide/driver. The tour I went on was the 2 day wildlife safari tour. Our driver/tour guide was maudi. He did a great job!

My partner and I went a tour of the Garden Route with this tour company and we found it became the most enjoyable part of our entire two-week trip to Cape Town and also our favourite of all the tours we went on. The booking service through their website was excellent with prompt email confirmation of payment and details of trip. On the morning of pick-up we were collected on time and were so relieved to have been greeted by such a friendly, helpful and easy-going tour guide (Isaac). Unlike a particularly annoying tour guide we had encountered from another company a few days before (which almost put us off from going on any other tours!), Isaac was friendly without being too intrusive and too over-enthusiastic/loud. He was also amazingly helpful and accommodating throughout the whole of our tour, and the fact that he was able to maintain this while managing several young adults on such a tight schedule was hugely impressive. The same can be said of his driving skills! The van was also very comfortable even at high speed along the N2. Personal possessions were kept safe and secure at times in the van and locked trailer. The activities included in the itinerary were also first-class. If you enjoy outdoor activities (kayaking, swimming, climbing, bungee-jumping) and wildlife/nature experiences you will not be disappointed! Accommodation was also excellent. As me and my partner are slightly older we chose the guesthouse options which (although beautiful) we later regretted as the backpacker hostels were much trendier and equally as comfortable! Most fun could be had at the hostels in the evenings and the food/drink at these hostels were both cheap and delicious. We wished we had booked a private room in the hostel instead, especially as the others on our tour who stayed at the hostel were so friendly and fun-loving.I was quite worried before I went on this tour that it would be too rushed, as we had heard from other people that 72 hours to cover the Garden Route would not be enough. Well I could not disagree more - we were able to cover both Route 62 and the whole of the Garden Route along the N2 within this time without feeling rushed at all. This was due to the supreme planning and organisation of hotspots2c, and the well-paced and interesting itinerary/route. We had also originally planned to hire a car and explore the Garden Route ourselves, but I can honestly say that we wouldn't have seen or experienced half the things we did on this tour if we had done so. So in short, I would throughly recommend doing any tour with this company. They are enjoyable, extremely well-planned and well-executed and a bonus is that they are relatively cheap as well so provide excellent value for money."

From start to finish Hotspots was professional, timely, accommodating, and flexible with my group. My most recent trip with Hotspots was a special one at that. With Hotspots help I was able to plan and organize a trip with a group of less privileged children I'd been working with. After living and teaching in the Township of Kayamandi, for 4 months, it became mine and a friends goal to provide a few of these awesome kids with the chance to see and experience their own beautiful country. With that idea I knew exactly who to contact and Hotspots helped us out every step of the way! If you'd like to read more about our trip feel free to visit, www.OSullivansTravels.com I can't express enough how amazing our trip was and the impaction it will forever have on those children. I'll forever be thankful of the friendship I've made with Hotspots. To make things even better, we had my great friend Isaac as our tour guide. This man in legendary and a true master of guides.

When we started the tour, one thing was obvious: this group is tiptop especially our tourguide Isaac who tends to exaggerations and ironic statements. When we went to such \"dangerous\" and \"life-threatening\" trips he always wanted to make sure if we left our creditcards in the car just for the case we wouldn't come back alive. Isaac is always good for some jokes :) Not only the guide but also the tour on the whole with all the places we went to were simply great! Elefant riding, ostrich farm, mysterious and challenging cango caves, relaxing boat trip, best thing in the world: bungy jump of the world's highest bridge, really advisable; shopping in the outlet stores of billabong and Co. at j-bay, nice hiking through tsitsikama nationalpark, swimming in the indian ocean, big5 game drive etc... Absolutely exciting, never boring, so many expressions and so much to see. Also the hostels were a dream, 2 of them directly at the beach, very clean and nice furnishing. So in general the 4 day Garden Route Tour is definitely a good choice and worth the money. It includes impressions and experiences you won't forget and shouldn't miss. Also the funniest guide in the world Isaac contributed to this great adventure :-) "

Our first stop , Ronnie`s Sex Shop, which is legend on Route 65.At the ostrich farm we learnt all about the amazing bird and got to ride and feed them .Then off to ride and feed the elephants. What a great time we had, the elephants are so gentle. WOW what an experience. Sunday after breakfast it was off to the Cango Wildlife Ranch , where we were taken around by a very knowledgeable guide , then we had the opportunity to have one on one encounters with some of the animals . Tigers, Lemurs, and Cheetahs to mention a few. Our last stop a 2 hour game drive where we got to see all the Big 5 . There were plenty stops along the way to grab a bite to eat and drink. If you want to see tons of animals I highly recommend this trip and price wise it is worth every cent spent.Thank you all at Hotspots2c for an AWESOME weekend ."

We ended to love him ! Thank you many times, Eon !On both trips we had beautiful accommodation in very different and 4 Stars Hotels/Guesthouses , good and tasty breakfasts . Both guides organized some special dinners for us , we enjoyed those evenings a lot .Both Tours exceeded our expectations and are worth each penny.

I walked with elephants, explored caves, rode an ostrich, canoed in paradise, met local children on a beach, bungie jumped the worlds highest bungy bridge, and got to see my favourite African animals on a game drive!! It's the Cheetah by the way :) Hotspots offers many different tours, so you can choose what you'd like to do/see and how long you'd like your trip to be. I'm Canadian, and the other members of the tour group were Swiss, Russian and German, ranging in age from 19 to 55.

Isaac(3-day) and Xenny (4-day) were incredibly FANTASTIC guides and became great friends! As well as teaching us so much they were so fun as well! This is why i did two tours with Hotspots, because the guides really did all they could to make it great, by being flexible and chilled taking time to stop off and spend longer time at certain points on the tour we enjoyed, asking us if everything was okay and would let us do any extra activities we would like along the way! I went with the budget option, which meant i stayed in dorm rooms in hostels, and this was definitely a great option, as not only did you make friends on your own tour, but also could make friends with other travelers in the hostels. All the hostels were very well chosen, as they allowed the tour to flow seamlessly without any long trips to get there, and they were clean and comfortable!I'm so so glad I went on these fantastic tours, and despite originally thinking I would never do a bungy jump, I did the world's highest! And it was phenomenal! These tours I will always remember, I saw some of the most beautiful sites of South Africa, had lots of fun, and made really great friends. All round, exactly what you want!"

We saw so much of the beautiful countryside and never felt rushed or \"herded\" around. The guides let you enjoy every stop and never hurry you on.

We did a game drive on the first day before spending the night in a fab hostel where we had the tastiest braii (big BBQ) and played pool in the hostel bar all evening where we mad plenty of friends. The following day was crammed full of unforgettable experiences. We got to spend the morning with 3 elephants where we hand fed them and got to have photos while sitting on their knees or backs. It was incredible to get up so close to these majestic animals. From there we went to an ostrich farm which is definitely an experience you won't forget as you see people ride them and attempt to kiss them. Finally we stopped at cango animal ranch where you ge to see lots of different animals in a zoo like setting but get taken round by a guide which is very informative. Here we were abl to pay a little extra to get up close with some of the animals including white tiger cubs, lemurs, snakes or cheetahs. I spent time cuddling the cheetahs which was unbelievable they were so tame and purred away while you stroked them. Fabulous company to do a safari with as you get to do so many more things with them."

We did canoe on a river, visited elephant park (fed them and walked with them), ostrich farm, jumbed from the highest bridge (260 m)- bungy jumpinig, got some tan on the beach, intered the Camgo Cave! Every day was an adventure! Organization and accomodation (backpackers) were perfect! Our guide, Johan, was very knowledgeable and flexible. He tried to do everything in the best way and comfortable for the people! Highly recommend to do this tour to everyone who comes to South Africa!I think that this is the best way to visit Garden Route if you do not have a car or can not drive. Cost of a trip was absolutely affordable. Thank you very much for this trip! Karina, 24 years, Russia"

Our tour guide Rochelle did very well and was not only well informed about the places itself, we visited, but as well about the economical, political and cultural background connected to these sides. Everything was almost perfect. My partner Siegfried and me decided to take the backpackers en suite option, not to spare the money for the guesthouse (the price difference wasn't that big, by the way) but because we had learned from other trip advisor comments that the backpackers would be at the nicer places. Infact all backpackers were very well situated. The standard of the rooms were a little bit different. By any standards the best accommodation was near Addo national park. We stayed at a farm side in the so called \"castle\" which was more like a guesthouse room than a backpackers double room. The food we'd got was at all places memorable. Rochelle was one o the best tour guides I've ever had! The activities were the pure fun. We did the early morning tour through Addo National park where we saw not only lots of the 600 - 700 elephants they have there, but one of the only 10 Lions who live there in a space almost as big as Belgium (!). Besides that we saw Kudus, Zebras and a lot more ... Fun was also the Canopytour, the tour with canoes, the adventure in the cave adventure an last but not least the skydiving. Can't tell everything. I would travel with Earthstompers again!"

Our guide Charlene was awesome, has a superb knowledge of her country and a great sense of fun that enhanced the whole experience. Her safari game drive in our opinion was better than the early morning ranger drive! We took the guest house accommodation option but ate as a group at the backpackers, usually a braai or the house speciality and were not disappointed with either. This trip really enhanced our holiday experience and we would thoroughly recommend it."

I myself cannot express how impressed and happy I am with the trip and all that we was able to do in as little as six days and clock up so many miles in that time frame!Cindy and Ferne's enthusiasm made the trip that extra bit special and didn't go unnoticed along with their knowledge on the history of the Garden Route made it that little bit more special. From our very first to our last day we were looked after, fed well and also placed in nice Backpack suites which gave us a social vibe throughout the evening round numerous camp and beach fires.I myself feel that this tour made me overcome boundaries and obstacles I would never have overcome before, and also allowed me to meet people from all over the world. Please please please book this tour!! On the first day of us being off the tour, myself and my boyfriend felt completely lost and had no idea what to do with ourselves, yes the tour is time scheduled and action packed but that's what made it so exciting! This tour is arranged and time-tabled to a T, and I did not expect to see and do as much as I did and what was listed in the tour guide itself. Thank you Earthstompers, Cindy and Ferne!!!!"

Also, our guide Rochelle created a very good atmospher and enthusiasm!On the last day, the group was split because some wanted to do the shark diving. But they did everything to put the group together after the sharks and it was very much appreciated. To do so, Rochelle had to wake up at 4am to drive us and then come back to pick the group. She drove a lot and Earths. didnt charge anything, we thank you for that!The only activity we did not really enjoy was the addo elephant park... not such a great experience.I sincerely recommend the tour and the company because you will do great activities and the company is well managed!"

I'm usually the leader of group trips rather than a participant, but I'm really glad I joined the Earthstompers 6-day Garden Tour for my first visit to Africa (let alone South Africa). Maybe we were lucky that the 8 of us were all so easy going and enthusiastic, but I also think our guide Rochelle contributed a lot to the upbeat energy we shared, despite being a diverse group (early 20's to mid 50's, German, American, Canadian and both French and German Swiss). Nothing was too much trouble for Rochelle, who always went the extra mile to make our trip informative, comfortable and enjoyable. While I didn't try shark diving, bungee jumping or parachuting, most of us tried and had fun on the adventure cave, the zip-lining canopy and the whale watching tours. (The shark divers among us were much enthused about that tour). The canoeing and walking in Wilderness, and the viewpoints and beaches at various spots along the coast were sublime. Lots of wildlife: in addition to whales, the penguins were delightful and the Ellies at Addo fantastic. The food was delicious (many meals included), and almost all my guesthouse rooms were very special. Buy wine at the wine tasting estate to enjoy later at dinner! My only reservation was the optional safari game ride at Addo, early in the morning. To some extent, we just weren't lucky (saw more animals later in the day with Rochelle driving through the park), but I thought the Addo driver was lack luster, reciting information in a monotone about the animals we did see. Having stayed in a private game reserve near Kruger where we had a driver and a spotter in a smaller vehicle and where we could go off road onto smaller tracks or even in the bush, I didn't think this optional activity was worthwhile. To be fair, though, if we'd seen more wildlife (the lions were elusive and the elephants were hiding out until it warmed up later), I might feel differently.But this was just one small reservation: otherwise, this was a perfect trip - despite that I nearly got stuck in the Devil's Chimney at the Cango Cave.. I would recommend coming at a warmer time of year when perhaps longer days might allow for a more leisurely pace - or at least more time on the beach at the end of the day. But truly, it's an amazing tour at anytime, and Rochelle is an absolute gem."

The bus was clean and air conditioned and the places we stayed at were all in beautiful locations. Of course I would have liked to stay longer in places but the tour never dragged or felt rushed.

It was the highlight of my two-week visit to South Africa.A friend and I booked a 6-day backapakers tour wherein we slept at five different lodges/inns for five consecutive nights. The package gives visitors the option to choose from different types of accommodations. We chose the one with a private toilet and bath.Rochelle, our guide, was terrific from the first minute she picked us up from our guest house in Capetown. It helped that our group of seven people meeting for the first time hit if off soon after. We were from Denmark, England, Scotland and the Philippines.Driving a distance of around 2,500km for five days, Rochelle gave us the history and bits of information about the various places we visited and passed by. Lunch was paid by us but nearly all dinners and breakfasts were part of the package. I particularly enjoyed the dinners. The tour price was just right!I would recommend for visitors to bring shampoo and soap as these are not provided by the places where we slept. Also, make sure to clarify the approximate time you would be picked up and returned to your starting point so you can book your hotel or onward flight.We had to change our flight to Johannesburg as we will miss our original schedule. Rochelle was so helpful looking for alternate flights and finding us a ride to the airport so we can catch a our new flight.Do keep an open mind and make new friends, and try out the bungee jump and tandem skydive! These were optional and we are glad we chose to do them. My videos on Youtube will be seen and enjoyed in the coming years.Thank you Rochell and Earthstompers! Arnel (Philippines) "

She gave us a lot of information about everything we were crossing by and her country in general. We really appreciated. In addition she was so helpful with the booking and the logistics of our different optional activities. The different backpackers we stayed in were very nice, the food was delicious, the activities were so diferent and nice (there is not so many country where you can bungee jump, do a safari, a shark cage diving, enjoy the beach... in a so short period of time). South Africa is a very beautiful country and visiting it with a small group is definitly a good option. It has been a great week for us and we totally recommend the tour with Earthstompers."

She gave us a lot of information about the landscape, animals, food, wine, culture... She knows everything about her home country and that was a big enrichment for us :) Due to we had nearly every age on our group, different nationalities, single travellers, friends and couples we had a lot of interesting conversations while we travelled through the beautiful Garden Route.It was an adventurous trip with great activities which everyone enjoyed a lot.The accomodations (we booked backpacker style in a twin room) were nice, clean and especially with it's own special character.After the amazing Addo we had a meeting point for our Safari Extension and had to say goodbye to our group.We are really happy that we decided to do the tour with Earthstompers. So we can totally recommend the tour and the Safari Extension. "

She was organised, fun and clearly passionate about her beautiful country. The tour was busy and fun, I stayed in the bed and breakfast and the rooms were beautiful, we had dinner at the backpackers every evening and these were equally good, so either option would be great. You see and do so much: canoeing, caving, hiking, zip wiring, sky diving. The food is fantastic too."

Awesome.This 5-day tour was exceptional value for money.The activities have been chosen to be both great fun, challenging and show-off the best that this area has to offer. The accommodation was first rate. I chose the guest house accommodation and most of my nights were truly beautiful (especially Dover-on-Sea at Sedgefield) but the hostel accommodation (where you eat at night) was cool, funky and very very clean. I would happily have stayed there. The meals which are included are delicious and very much appealed to the foodies in our group - also authentically SA.I would recommend all of the activities especially the canoeing/hiking (included) and our group did a mixture of the extra activities. All were superb.Our guide (Rochelle) went above and beyond. She was knowledgable, cheerful, caring and very very hardworking. She made sure everyone in the group was happy and well informed throughout. She really turned a wonderful trip into an unforgettable holiday of a lifetime. She has an expert knowledge of her country and the Garden Route and is proud to be an ambassador to visitors.I cannot recommend this trip more highly."

Wild Wings Safari was our \"travel agency\" in South Africa that put me in touch with Earthstompers. Booking the trip was easy and painless. The trip itself was exceptional. Rochelle was our guide and she was extremely knowledgeable (I did ask her a ton of questions). We were a group of 8 girls whom all connected well. We would spend all day together so it was fun getting to know other people from different parts of the world. My girlfriends and I stayed at the most adorable guest houses and the rest of the girls stayed at the backpackers option. For dinner we would all eat together at the different backpackers facility which was great!!! Either sleeping accommodation is great. Everyone we interacted with was so incredibly nice and helpful. I only wish South Africa was closer to the US so I could return sooner! I highly recommend this trip if it's your first time in South Africa and beginning your trip in Cape Town. You will see and do a lot and meet great people. I also recommend for someone traveling alone too."

The places we stayed at were great (backpackers en-suite), very realxed, clean, good food! The activities were fun and exciting. The beaches were absolutely stunning, and we didn't even have the best weather. Definitely do the sandboarding and the adventure tour at the caves! And choose the backpacker option, the guesthouses were often too far away to walk, so the guys staying there missed out on some of the evening drinks... I strongly recommend this trip to everybody looking for an active, fun and relaxed holiday."

Then, the landscapes, attractions and accomodations were very diversified and nice. I loved eating at a restaurant, feet on the sand ! Meals were very good and varied. We saw lots of animals in different lanscapes : penguins, cassies on the rocks, the game drive of course, ostriches, birds. The group was very friendly and it was a very nice travel.

Mostly between age 21-37, so definately for the young generation.I have to say the tour was a lot about 'rush rush' and not having a lot of free time. Yes we traveled 2000km in those 6 days but could not enjoy a few moments by ourselves.It was a lot about waiting for other people, people forgetting things, people wanting extra things which went on the costs of others. Also do not under estimate the time being spent driving on the road as it as A LOT - every day.We saw a lot and had fun times that's for sure. Enjoyed the ostrich farm, ziplining, sandboarding, Addo Park etc You could also go bungy jumping or skydiving.. I stayed in the single en-ensuite Hostels and was positively surprised about the rather high standard. Dinner was always delicious too (just note that for guesthouse people dinner is always being served in the hostels).I made some good friends too on this trip :-)"

I did the backpackers and everyone was great except for the afrovibe. My roomie and I both found it very dirty and unsafe. But mostly dirty our bathroom smelled soo bad you had to hold your breath when entering. And if you kept the the door open the mildew smell would permeate the whole living quarters. They needed a scrub bucket and some bleach and get in that shower which is where it was the nastiest and scrub that place down. As for the unsafe there were no locks on the doors and no lockers for your stuff so i didnt like that much. But other than that 1 night the whole experience was fabulous and i would do it again in a flash. It was the best part of my african adventure!!!"

From the moment we were picked up, Rochelle went above and beyond her role to look after us, get to know us, share her passion and love for the country, and make our Christmas unforgettable! Each day had a well thought out and planned itinerary which allowed us to see and experience as much of the beautiful country on the route as possible. It was certainly an active tour and I particularly enjoyed the gentle canoe followed by a tranquil le walk to a waterfall for lunch in Wilderness; it was easy to understand why Rochelle loves her job so much with all the stunning places to see!The transport was very comfortable, modern and ideal for a road trip. The accommodation always had a great atmosphere and the dinners and breakfasts were all superb! Waking up early Christmas Day and heading out to see lions, elephants, buffalo, zebra, warthogs, ostriches... in Addo was a real highlight as was the magnificent accommodation on Christmas Eve; a little slice of paradise.This was a truly unforgettable trip and I would definitely go on it again!

We had to reschedule our trip 3 times due to some personal unintended issues.A very big heartfelt 'Thank you' to Earthstompers for your kind understanding!Nothing can be better than what Charlene (our most caring and energetic guide) had arranged for us. We took 6 days Garden Route. Excellent Guest Houses, variety of food, lots of activities, pristine beaches, beautiful wild life & never tiring smiley Charlene have stolen our heart. We recommend Earthstompers wholeheartedly."

Very well organized, overnight stops located in marvelous places , especially Sedgefield, one near citrus plantation and Agulhas Cape- we took upgrade backpackers package. Variety of great meals during whole trip. Tour guide (Stephanie) knowledgeable, helpful, caring and a very good driver! Fantastic people from all over the world in our group, great atmosphere everyday. Many activities to choose during tour, bungee, sky diving, ostrich farm etc. Is not coach type of tour, flexibility is an advantage just be on time on bus."

They are interessted to show people as lot as possible about the beautiful country. In my opinion they take care very much about their guests and the country. All accomondations very nice. Even if we had to drive long distances, it was never the Feeling of \"loosing time in the car\" ... The guide always told us interesting Storys, we made stops inbetween to visit nice places and had also some time to relax or shop a little bit. We can recommend earthstompers 100%"

Beside our personal highlight the tour was totally organized. Every night a great new guesthouse or hostel and yummie dinner. We just can say thank you to Cindy, our guide. She explaint everything to us and took care about everyone and you can see that she just loves her job and southafrica. So just perfect. Thank you for six beautiful days."

Plus our guide Rochelle was fantastic \u2013 really informative and passionate about South Africa. When the rain almost prevented us from canoeing in Wilderness, Rochelle even had a number of alternative options for us, meaning we got a bonus visit to an amazing cave. And thankfully the rain stopped and we did get to do the canoeing as well, which was definitely one of the highlights of the trip for me.We stayed in the guest houses and the accommodation was a very high standard. We ate at the hostels each night with the group and they had a really nice vibe to them as well. The food was really lovely and they provide great vegetarian options.I can thoroughly recommend Earthstompers \u2013 not only was the trip itself really great, but the office staff are really helpful.

Having already spent a week being spoilt on a safari lodge I was less than looking forward to staying in \"hostels\" but boy was I wrong. The accommodation on this tour is actually of quite a high standard and would recommend to anyone to pick this option over the guesthouse, the hostels are very homely and nothing what I expected so was pleasantly surprised, all the food was fresh and home cooked, the atmosphere was brilliant and the hosts did everything they could to accommodate you. The garden route is stunning and we were lucky enough to have nice weather throughout our trip and even luckier to have such an amazing guide in Charlene, she was very knowledgable and even went out of her way to retrieve my partner's IPad when he left it at hostel. There is a wide choice of optional activities to do and Always something to keep you busy. All in all it was a great second half of our holiday to South Africa and we met some great people from all over the world."

Hendrik and Chrissy were great at keeping in touch pre-departure and thoroughly answered all my questions and made useful suggestions. Our guide, Charlene, was wonderful. She made the trip extra special and knew so much about everything we encountered. Even with the extra activities, the itinerary was excellent value for money without comprising in quality. The backpackers we stayed in were all of a high standard and made some incredible food. Be warned though, the trip is intense with activities and does have some long driving - unavoidable unfortunately but the journey is beautiful and you get to see all the best bits of the garden route as a result. The safari extension, although expensive (most safaris are) was worth the money. It was a unique experience staying in Amakhala in a tent and definitely a highlight. I wish EarthStompers would cover the rest of this beautiful country - 200% recommended!"

With guide Rochelle I immediately knew I'd made the right choice and our disparate group of four from 18 to never mind had such fun and will remain a highlight of my African trip. I'd upgraded to en suite rooms which were well worth it. Don't expect hairdryers, great lighting or good powerpoints but be amazed at how liberating a new attitude to travel and adventure can be. The tour exceeded all my expectations and thank you again to Rochelle who helped make it possible for me to accept a job offer back home which made my holiday. It sounds easy but not at the Southernmost tip of a different continent! TIA ('This Is Africa!') doesn't keep her from getting the job done - with a smile.

We have done some amazing things (bungee jumping) and we always stayed in very nice and cozy backpackers. The diners were absolutely mind blowingly jummie and most of the time really typical South African, which I really liked (we ate for example ostrich meat, did a nice braai and ate potje). Unfortunately my dorm was broken into and me, my friend and a girl from the group were robbed from our camera's and money. We lost all of our pictures and this was of course a very sad experience. Everyone (the company, the owners of the farm where we stayed and Charlene) were very shocked, because it has never happened before on a tour. Even though I had the feeling my entire holiday was ruined, Charlene managed to make me smile and enjoy myself again (and I'm very thankful for that). Earthstompers sent us a heartwarming email and we were taken to diner to a very nice restaurant, where we had an amazing night. We can't get our pictures back, but my memories will always remain and I will definitely remember how well I was taken care of in the sad circumstances.

The dinners were delicious in each of the places we stayed and the accommodations were great and tailored to individual budgets. Full credit goes to our stellar guide Charlene for being such an incredible host, logistics coordinator, driver and keen eyed animal spotter. Her love and enthusiasm for South Africa and its people was easily conveyed and she did an amazing job keeping us all informed, entertained and on schedule. Thanks again Charlene for everything and for making the trip so memorable for everyone. You've no doubt inspired many return visits to South Africa!"

Adventure in Cango Caves and Tsitsikammma Park, beautiful sights on the road, on the water (WIldernis canoeing) and on many stops. Overwhelming nature and wildlife. the Addo nature park drive is superb (the early morning one was cold and very foggy but we saw the buffalo - and I saw a female lion though I can't prove with a picture ...), we saw hundreds of elephants and many other animals. The group dinners were very good and the accommodation (we were in guesthouses) beyond imagination. Last but not least - Charlene and Rochelle (first day) are excellent professionals who made us feel comfortable and taught us so much about SA, we'd never have been able to find out for ourselves.

The accomodation was very good too, all the loactions were like a home from home and ideal locations to relax after a days touring and the food was simply delicous, I'm dribbling just remembering some of the wonderful dishes we were served!I had a few things I really wanted to see on my first visit to Africa and this tour delivered them all from breathtaking scenery to the most amazing animals.You really would be daft to look elsewhere for your Garden Route Tour operator, Book Earthstompers today!"

I have enjoyed everything! The tourbus was very comfortable (airconditioned) and the accomodations/rooms were clean, spacious and always situated at special atmospheric places.

The thought and professionalism that went into planning this amazing and reasonably-priced tour to include a wide range of experiences that would appeal to people of all ages from around the world was evident. Our friendly tour leader, safe driver and wonderful guide Stephanie has a wide breadth and depth of knowledge about all things South Africa and Africa that she was more than willing to share and went the extra mile to insure that each of the five special and friendly people on our tour had a memorable and wonderful time. For example, I had mentioned that I liked sweeter wines; and she asked the people at the winery to give me samples of sweeter wines to taste. She also dropped me off at a delightful museum while the rest of my group (half my age) went sky diving. Traveling in a comfortable air-conditioned bus, we saw stunning scenery, beautiful beaches, waterfalls, rugged mountain peaks and passes, rivers and river gorges, fields, flowers, thickets, and forests. We sampled delicious local wines and local food, including babootie, malva, and braii, visited a farmer's market, and stayed at comfortable, clean lodgings. We visited the southern most tip of Africa and saw wildlife galore from African penguins (Betties Bay), baboons, and ostriches (Oudtshoorn) to elephants, zebras, hyenas, jackals, and a black maned Kalahari lion at Addo Elephant National Park. We canoed, hiked, explored caves, and had the opportunity to swim with sharks, bungee jump off the highest bridge in the world, sky dive, and take a canopy tour via zip line. It was a terrific tour; and I can recommend taking the Garden Route Tour or any forthcoming tour from Earthstompers without any hesitation."

Charlene, our tour guide, was excellent and felt more like a friend than a tour guide. The trip was very well organized and had a good mix of activities and down time to enjoy the backpackers (hostels), a few drinks, and each other's company. I also felt like I gained a deeper understanding of South African culture and politics than I ever could have if I had done the trip on my own or with another standard tour company.

Activities can be tailored to your preference, with plenty on offer for adrenalin junkies. Be aware that the tour is fast-paced, and a significant amount of time is spent in the van (to cover all that distance). I would also recommend taking the option of a private room at the hostels, rather than the dorm.Overall, the trip was incredibly fun.

The wine tour was great and I really enjoyed the Sandboarding. The only thing I didn't enjoy is the Ostrich farm, its good fun except for when people try to ride them, they have to catch the ostrich by the neck and then hood them, its just unkind. The beaches we went to were beautiful and Titskamma is really beautiful. The canopy zip-lining was also great fun. It was just non stop gogogo (but you can catch up on sleep in the bus). You could also do whale watching, Elephant sanctuary and shark cage diving which they add onto the tour if you want to :)We stayed in the Backpackers which I strongly recommend over the guest houses. Every single back packers we stayed at had the best atmosphere, all very friendly, clean and comfortable. Also, the tour always ate at the back packers, I think people staying in the guest houses got annoyed that they had to get driven home every night after dinner rather than staying on and drinking. You do not have to stay in a dorm (although we did) you can ask for private rooms. I went with my friend but we also had to honeymoon couples on our tour who I know loved every minute of it also :)Earthstompers sort everything out for you so all you have to do is enjoy yourself :)Chloe"

Charlene was such a knowledgeable and friendly guide, and went out of her way to make sure everyone had a fun, safe experience. As a solo traveller, I was slightly concerned about joining a group where I didn't know anyone, but as there were only 7 people in total we gelled instantly, and I made friends from a diverse selection of countries including Singapore, Switzerland and Germany. The scenery on the Garden Route is spectacular, and the mix of activities Earthstompers include caters for everyone, from canoeing to bungee jumping and everything in between. All the backpackers we stayed in were clean and comfortable, and we had some delicious braai in the evenings. There is a lot packed in to this tour, so the pace may not suit everyone, but it is great value for money, with attentive guides and some of the most breathtaking countryside you will ever witness.

Every day was something new and different, our group of 12 was a great mix of interesting people, and having the option of being able to choose from multiple different options for our \"extra\" activities made it almost like a custom-designed trip. Stephanie was so knowledgeable, nice, and accommodating for all our needs. Our vacations have typically been more \"do-it-ourselves\" type affairs, but it was so nice to have someone else do all driving, have all the great lodging and much of the dining arrangements already taken care of, and not have to concern ourselves with those decisions. One of the highlights for us was all the up-close encounters with multiple kinds of wildlife during the early-morning Ranger-led wildlife viewing trip at Addo Elephant National Park. We have already highly recommended this trip to our friends."

First, we couldn't have been more lucky with the composition of our 12 person group. Our ages ranged from 17 to 57 (but everyone was ageless in their interactions), and we represented five different nationalities (but everyone was able to communicate and relate as if we were all neighbors). Every where we toured and stayed was really spectacular. The only negative was that we didn't get to spend enough time at each stop. I wish we could have had a longer trip... (our fault). Hendrick was incredibly informative, accommodating, and willing to cater to our unique needs. He also did a remarkable job of offering a wide variety of activities that kept everyone entertained."

Earth Stompers was able to set us up with the perfect itinerary to meet each and every need with the greatest level of comfort and confidence along the way. Nicolene was beyond professional and caring. We felt safe and taken care of in her hands even though we were thousands of miles away from home. Nicolene went above and beyond what should have been expected of her as a tour guide. She anticipated our needs and usually had them taken care of before we even had to ask. She respected our privacy yet was happy to join us for meals, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The communication between myself and Earth Stompers as to payments was smooth and professional. We have nothing negative to report...only to recommend this company with the highest of regards for a trip of a lifetime you will never forget."

We experienced a lot of great things we would have never seen if we would have organised the tour by ourselves.Our Tourguide Nicole gave us so much information about the country that we could not only learn a lot but understand the people and the way of living in South Africa better.Because we were only 5 people she could cater to our wishes and make it individually special for all of us. The included meals were very good, we could experience typical south african dishes and special places. The accommodations were all comfortable We stayed in the guest houses and were very satistfied with all the places.Also the activity level is fine and you can organise the tour by your own wishes with all the special trips. You just should be prepared to get up early in the morings to manage all the activities.I would defently recommend trips with earthstrompers adventures because I could have not imagined the trip being any better!"

The trip via the vast and stunning, diverse countryside was exceptional, only topped by Henrik's(our guide) soothing and educational narrative as we cruised through. The accommodation was of a really high standard for the bag packers so if you really want a luxury treat...you can go with the guest houses. We went with the private bagpackers room and found the room very clean (sometimes quite spacious/luxurious) with amazing character...often a chic bohemian style. Meals are provided for every day at the bagpackers digs and is absolutely delicious regardless of your diet. I'm fussy and was never disappointed!There are lots of adventures for thrill seekers and for those of us that are slightly faint at heart, a beer and an ocean are never too far away. A must do if time permits in Cape Town, was definitely the highlight of my visit. I must also say that Hendrik went above and beyond to ensure everyone had a good time, so there's no need to be shy for lone travellers!"

Earthstompers were outstanding from when I first dealt with Chrissy at the office to arrange the trip, through to our awesome holiday and guide Hendrick. Chrissy was always prompt to respond to my emails and worked with me to tailor a custom tour for our group of 7 along the Garden route. When we arrived we were so lucky to get Hendrick as our guide. He was so much fun and ensured we all had a fabulous time. The accommodation that they picked for our group was perfect. We stayed in the most amazing farmhouse for our last night and Hendrick even arranged for the owner to cook us a traditional brie on the outdoor fire. He even bought along 4 bottles of red wine for us as a surprise!! Hendrick took us to all the best local restaurants and eateries and went out of his way to ensure our experience was the best it could be and that every little detail was covered. Hendrick was well and truly the best guide we had on our whole 4 1/2 week vacation through Africa. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending him and can't wait to go back to South Africa and do another tour with him and Earthstompers along the amazing Garden route."

The trip had great breakfasts and dinners provided. Every day was a new adventure from bungee jumping the highest bungee bridge in the world (Bloukrans Bridge), to seeing beautiful beaches in Tsitsikamma and Wilderness, to even seeing a lion eat a kudu in Addo National Park.  Nicole, our guide, wanted to make sure everyone on the trip had a good time. She was very knowledgeable and accommodating. Therefore, if one person didn't want to do an activity she would arrange for that person to do something else - dropping them off and picking them up. E.g. some people didn't want to visit the ostrich farm and ride ostriches so she arranged to take them to an animal park in the area and pet lions. Nicole also has a sweet disposition that made the trip that much more enjoyable. We travelled quite a long distance in the bus but the ride was comfortable, conversation amiable, and the view beautiful. She also dropped me off at the airport and helped me pick up some supplies for my next trip through Botswana to Vic Falls. I would highly recommend this trip."

We learnt a lot about SA's history, geography, cultural, and more importantly had heaps of FUN. The caves was beautiful, did canoeing, bush walking, bungee jump (1st time ever), safari in Addo, stayed at different guest houses, had a bit of wine (beautiful, should have bought more).I would not hesitate to recommend Earthstompers to anyone thinking of doing the Garden Route tour, you will not regret it. Me and partner have been travelling pretty extensively (5 continents done) in the last 4 years with different tour groups and this was no doubt the best.

I'm just sorry it took me such a long while to write this review (I travelled in Feb 2014) - and sorry for those people who may have made a crazy decision to go with other operators!!From the start I experienced nothing but professionalism and attention to detail. I got a response to my out of hours email within 6 hours and the booking process and costs were transparent and secure. I opted for a hostel ensuite private room for the week and I didn't regret this for a second. We stayed in a variety of individually styled hostels. All were clean and vibrant with very friendly and accommodating hosts. Earthstompers check out each one and know the people who run them. The range of experiences themselves were amazing. Nicole has such a breadth of knowledge and a really good feel for the group and our likes that we really got the best out of every tour stop. We were such a varied group with ages 20s to 50s but we all got on so well which was great! I opted for the tandem skydive and the bungee jump - and I felt the organisations that ran these activities were very focused on safety and on making sure I had fun! Additionally, Nicole went out of her way to make us each feel comfortable - she accommodated my weird food dislikes and even helped arrange for me to get an \"emergency\" manicure! I will never forget my time in South Africa. It is an awesome country with such amazing people and so much natural beauty, and Earthstompers were key to making it truly a holiday of a lifetime."

Even if you passed your midlife crisis already and if you don\u00b4t mind to travel with youngsters half of your age, I can fully recommend this venture. This tour is well organized, the atmosphere relaxed and personal and accomodations hand-selected. Our driver and guide Stephanie was always good-humored, helpful, knowledgeable and an excellent driver. This well over 2,000 km roundtrip is a comfortable way to explore part of the coastal region of South Africa within 6 days. Pick-up from our hotel was on the minute (as all the others during the trip). While bungee-jumping and shark-diving was not the challenge we needed, we loved the alternative hiking options and strolls along lonely beaches or rocky coasts (a pair of sturdy shoes recommended; hiking boots not required). Instead of the atmospheric hostels we had chosen guesthouse accomodations, which we always found very satisfying up to really luxurious. The same applies to breakfast and dinner (on most days included; dinner was always together with the group). We were lucky with the weather, mostly warm and sunny but not really hot, at times good to wear a jacket. Sunset is already around 6.p.m. Although the days were therefore relatively short we found this time of the year with the big crowds gone and amenable temperatures the perfect time to go on such a trip and enjoyed the evenings sitting around the fireside savoring a bottle of local beer or a glass of wine. Seeing elephants, zebras and other wilds beasts (e.g. in Addo N.P.) is a very different experience than going to a zoo. All in all a very diverse, worthwhile tour with a company that fully deserves its good reputation."

You will have such a good time! As a local Steph showed us so beautiful places you wouldn't have seen without going on this tour. The Backpackers we stayed in were great! Everyone was very special on their one way. All very clean and oooh I can't forget that! The FOOD! Yes the food was great. I am staying in Cape Town for half a year and haven't tried any local food. On this tour I had the opportnity to actually get to know this country better than I did after a few months in Cape Town! So for every type of personality there is always something to do: if you are the ADVENTURE type you can go bunjy jumping, skydiving or shark cage diving - if you are more interested in animals you can go on an Ostrich Farm tour, go to Knysna Elefant Park and actually touch the Elefants or go on an extra gamedrive in Addo Elefant Park-or if you're just the one that wants to chill you can just walk around the towns like Hermanus, Knysna and Mossel Bay, go to the woderful beaches on the way or go shopping Yay! So there is like a little something for everyone! I hope you actually just decided to go for this tour cause you won't regret it! Have a great time :)Oh yes Steph if you're reading this: Thank you for this wonderful time! I enjoyed it so much and I hope you are enjoying your Little White rabbit :) No no it's okay ;) Hope seeing you soon!!"

Our tour guide, Hendrik, was incredibly knowledgeable, professional and, most importantly, fun. He was always open to stopping for pictures, he would routinely buy us food and drinks so that we can enjoy authentic South African treats and he was constantly providing us with interesting information about the country's history. One thing to note is that much of the trip is weather permitting so, if you had bad weather like we did, you'll be spending a lot of time driving and not so much time doing. Some constructive feedback for Earthstompers in this regard is to consider finding alternative activities that may not be so affected by bad weather, such as wine tasting or various other sheltered attractions - even if these attractions may not be otherwise ideal - so that tour-goers have a bit more to do than just drive around and pout about the rain when the weather is bad. Notwithstanding, Hendrik did a great job of making things lively, wishing away the rain and keeping us entertained and having fun. I would recommend anyone to take this trip if they want to have a great time with great company."

As a local she provided us with insights to this beautiful country and looked after the group really well. Special thanks to her game drive at Addo Elephant Park, which was brilliant and the lovely picnic at the waterfall. Very special!The route was well thought out and full of highlights like Hermanus, Tsitsikamma, Addo Elephant Park and Mossel Bay. The group was a small, mixed age group and made us feel very welcome as a middle aged couple. The program is well designed for the more adventurous mind if you want to do shark cage diving or a 216m bungee jump, but you can also opt out and just relax and enjoy the scenery.We have done the tree canopy tour at Tsitsikamma, which is real fun and then I guess the highlight was the sky dive in Mossel Bay. The instructors are fabulous, very knowledgable and also very funny. It is well worth getting the video as it includes heaps of photos as well.We stayed at guest houses along the way, but now having seen the backpackers we could have easily stayed there. Brilliant locations!Earth stompers provide an exceptional service with this very well organized tour. We would like to thank Stephanie for showing us a glimpse of this beautiful country and we will be back for sure."

I choose that route and Earthstompers as an organizer, as i was a solo traveller and was looking for a mixed age (younger crowd) to travel with. This trip has by far excelled my expectations, we have travelled in a lovely mixed age group (20 upwards) and i can recommend anyone to utilize Earthstompers.Tour route and accomodationThe entire tour is designed to give you an overview on all major stops along the garden route tour. Each day was fabuluous and the accomodations choosen with knowledge of the nice spots, yet, still within budget e.g. hostels or b&b's You can choose which category you want to be in, the hostels are really with lots of charme and nice. Highlights of the trip were Hermanus, Tsitsikamma, Addo Elephant Park, Mossel Bay with beautiful sceneries, food and activities. Be aware that this trip gives you an insight, ideas on destinations you definitely should go back toOrganization via Earthstompers (tour guide Nicole)Earthstompers gives an exceptional service and feeling to the entire trip. Pick-up is arranged from your location within Capetown and drop-off as well. The tour includes a dedicated driver, in our case Nicole, who, with wit, charm and loving heart will give you all her positive energy and details about this beautiful country. I would like to thank Nicole for this amazing and unforgettable tour, i certainly will come back to South Africa."

One of us even booked last minute and the team managed to fit her in with no problems. Met a great bunch of people on the tour so that by the end I felt we were saying goodbye to old friends. Steph our guide and driver was an absolute treasure trove of information (Nicole who was with another group also joined us for dinner and drinks and we really enjoyed that too). I found Steph to be very informative and enthusiastic, her pride in her work and her country is evident. The highlight of the tour was the drive in Addo where we saw around 4/5 elephant herds rock up to the watering hole. The accommodation was excellent on each night as was the food. 2 of us were vegetarian and we were catered for at every dinner with a vegetarian version of the dish the meat eaters got. I really appreciated this as it helped me to get a taste of African cuisine (and I loved it). Lunch was a challenge as it wasn't always easy to get a vegetarian sandwich, however bread cheese and a juice were easily available. The optional activities were also a lot of fun and allow for a lot of flexibility. So even if you don't do any there are other things to do that are equally enjoyable. My only regret is that I did not book my Kruger trip with Earthstompers.I would recommend them to everybody, a must do if you want to see South Africa and have some fun at a reasonable price."

The van was comfortable and Nicole, our tour guide, was so conscientious and interested in making sure that everything we wanted or needed was available, it was wonderful. She really was our advocate during the trip, looking out for us, and making sure to give us all the good tips that would make the tour the best it could be. We upgraded and did not stay in the backpacker lodges, and all of the B&Bs that we stayed in were BEAUTIFUL and the breakfasts were delicious. The activities were great. The only one that we were somewhat disappointed in was the black-river tubing on the Storm's River which was more rock climbing than we anticipated. The water was very low and therefore we had less time in the water and more climbing over the boulders and the exit into the Indian Ocean was very dangerous because of the incoming tide which was super strong that day. I would not recommend this activity unless the river was higher, and you are prepared for a lot of rowing in your tubes. Again, Nicole was the BEST host we could have asked for....super knowledgeable and very interested in making our trip the best is could be. She even scheduled a massage for me the day after the river trip, which I REALLY needed. It was wonderful!"

The Garden Route seemed perfect and I was inclined to book with Earthstompers because of the great reviews I saw. This tour provided many more activities than other Garden Route trips I came across that are targeted toward college students. I chose to stay in the backpacker dorm accommodations and they were great, some locations went above and beyond what I imagined for a backpacker lodge/hostel. I believe all dinners were included except one, and those were all great meals as well. Allowed me to taste a lot of traditional South African dishes that I may not have had otherwise and they were all delicious. If you have a group that you would want to travel with this would be a great trip for you to book together. It was really a great way to see the Cape. Our guide, Nicole, was also super upbeat, friendly, and knowledgeable. She did an amazing job!All around great trip.

Beyond that we did a canoeing and hiking tour to an idyllic waterfall for example!

When I researched a Garden Route trip I found plenty of others that were a lot more expensive but seemed to offer far less. The Earthstompers tour packs in so much yet it is done in such a well planned way that you are never rushed.Our tour guide was Nicole who was excellent. Nicole was hugely knowledgable, she catered for everyone's needs and added in activities as and when the group asked. She went so far above and beyond what could have been asked of her - one of our fellow traveller's camera battery died so Nicole lent her new camera to them for the duration of the trip, another traveller was yet to organise accommodation for when they got back to Cape Town so Nicole organised it for them, and another traveller wanted a map so Nicole bought one for them. She is an excellent tour guide.The itinerary is fun and packed with beautiful spots and great accommodation. We covered so much ground and saw things that will stay with me forever. This trip is priced extremely low, whatever your budget, regardless of whether you can afford something more, this is still the trip for you if you really want to see the Garden Route and get the most out of it.Thank you Nicole, wish I could do it all again!"

I feel like I am going to repeat all of these fabulous comments...But I have to because this tour deserves all the praise it can get!This 6-day, 5-night Garden Route tour had a choice between guest houses or backpackers. I was hesitant to choose backpackers, but was pleased that I could pay a bit extra and get a private room with en-suite. Perfect. On top of that, I couldn't believe there was no extra charge for being SINGLE!! No single supplement!! This is a perfect tour if you are traveling solo, as a couple, or a family. It suits all! In our tour there were two single ladies and a family of 4. This is another advantage of Earthstompers, small groups up to a max of 12 or 13. We had 6. Chrissy and Hendrick (owners) of Earthstompers were very quick in responding to emails/questions I had prior to leaving and were genuine in welcoming me on board this tour.This was my second time visiting the Garden Route. I had done it solo two years ago but wanted to see more and go further. This tour touched on a lot of highlights I missed my first time around (or had no idea even existed) and also travelled further to Addo National Elephant Park. I can honestly say I have truly visited the Garden Route thanks to Earthstompers.Pick up was on time (although I made the mistake of giving the wrong pick up hotel address)...and this is where the WoW factor began with our tour guide, Nicole. Nicole made this tour. She was flexible, understanding, knowledgeable, accommodating, and fun. She is engaging and interesting, with a wealth of knowledge and passion about her country. We had great conversations during our drives... and a lot of laughs. We have become friends and I am writing this review for that reason, that's how good it was that I know I have made a lifelong friend with Nicole in the 6 days we spent together.All the backpackers hostels had special features; steps to the beach, practically on the beach, amongst citrus groves, amazing meals, and great hosts.The itinerary was fantastic and so flexible. There was absolutely no pressure to do anything and Nicole gave her honest but objective opinions about all excursions offered and it was up to us to decide what we wanted to do. I just can't say enough about this tour, the company and Nicole. If you are looking for clean, comfortable accommodation with amazing locations, exciting and beautiful excursions and experiences, fun, relaxed, down to earth atmosphere with an enthusiastic and passionate tour guide, AND affordable, then Earthstompers is the tour for you!I promise!!"

I did kayaking, tree top ziplining, a museum and elephant feeding as well as the standard activities and tours like Addo elephant park, the Cango caves, ostrich farm and wine tasting.The standard of accommodation was better than any backpackers I have ever stayed in before- the private rooms were more like 3/4* guesthouses. The food was also way above usual backpacker fare - home cooked meals and braii and stews at the various backpackers/guesthouses.So glad I booked this tour. Well done and thanks Earthstompers!"

I am amazed how Nicole \"understands\" people and makes them happy!Not sure which of the \"highlights\" to mention as I loved it all but what I will never forget is the feeling when half of the group went bungeejumping and some of us joined the bridge to encourage them and feel the vibe - goose bumps guarantee!!!Thank you Nicole for such a great time and for the surprise from back home!

Beautifully organized, the friendliest tour guide, great transport and well thought through destinations and overnight stays. I went with the backpackers option (single room) and it was a much higher standard than I thought it would be. Of course, you have to have a certain element of luck with the strangers you tour with being a personality fit, but I would highly recommend this company. Money definitely well spent."

It took the hassle out of organizing and driving. There was no way I'd be able to plan all of this in the and know how to see all the sights: national parks, canoeing, elephant parks, safiri, whale watching, shark cage diving, bungee if you want to, ostrich farm,caving and more. There are tons of options and something for evryone of every adventure level. The price was very good for all the activities and most days had two meals included- the food was excellent and the accomidation was very nice as well. I preferred the private rooms and was very happy with the lodging and facilities everywhere I went. I met some great people in the tour that I spent time with in cape town after the tour which was great for a solo traveler. The guide/owner Henrick was so pleasant, patient and informative. I loved the tour and would do it again in a heartbeat."

The tour that we went on happened to be very small and honestly felt like we were on a family vacation. Both tour guides made the trip enjoyable and made everyone feel included. Not only that, but Henrick went above and beyond in tracking down my luggage and getting it delivered to where we were staying three days into the trip. The places we stayed at exceeded expectations and were not what I would generally think of when booking hostels. The meals were absolutely wonderful ... I don't think that I have eaten so well on a vacation before. I would say that if you are looking for a tour to book of the Garden Route then this would definitely be the one that you would want to book. Thank you!"

Stephanie was our guide & nothing was too much hassle for her - she is just the nicest person & very knowledgeable. We stayed in the guest house accommodation and could not have been happier - a VERY high standard. Those in the group who stayed at the backpackers were also impressed with their accommodation. There were a couple of long days in the van which could maybe rescheduled somehow, but on the whole we were pleased with the itinerary. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone who wants to see the Garden Route & have some adventure as well."

South African Airways had a 2-day sale last fall so on a whim I bought tickets and then had only a couple weeks to plan our trip. Somebody had mentioned Earthstompers on one of the SA forums here, and that set our plans in motion! Booking through their website was easy, and we received a confirmation immediately as well as some additoinal forms to fill out and send back to Henrik. The entire registration process was very smooth and we found the prices ot be quite reasonable.We opted to start our tour off with the great white shark diving (awesome, by the way!) so we were picked up from our Cape Town hotel very early in the morning to head to the outfitter. We also picked up 2 other people in Cape Town, who turned out to be on our Earthstompers tour as well. It gave us some extra time to get to know each other and a fun way to begin the adventure! After shark diving, our guide Nicole and the rest of our tour group picked us up at the shark dive place. The only snag was that the little trailer attached to the van didn't quite fit everybody's luggage (many of us were ending our tour in Port Elizabeth, therefore we couldn't leave anything behind in Cape Town). With a little shuffling and shoving, and using some extra space in the van, Nicole was able to get everything in its place and get us on the road - clearly she's done this before!The itinerary was amazing and the places we stayed at were very cool. You have several choices for accommodations; most of us stayed in the hostels but one person chose the guest houses (a little nicer). Don't let the word \"hostel\" fool you though - some of the places we stayed at felt more like a comfy homestay and the accommodations were far from spartan. Every location was clean, safe, and walking distance to good restaurants and/or scenic views. And the food that some of the hostals provided was incredible!As with anything, what really makes a trip enjoyable are the people. We had an amazing tour group, 11 people (mostly from Europe) ranging from their 20's to a solo traveler in his 60's, and Nicole as our guide. Nicole did a wonderful job driving, narrating, translating, and answering our sometimes strange questions. She is wise beyond her years and also an excellent ambassador for South Africa - we came away from that trip knowing so much more about the country and its people. But most importantly, Nicole was just as much a part of the group as any of us - joining us at meals, making great recommendations on how to spend our free time, and just being an all out awesome person to hang out with. If my husband and I had planned out our own garden route tour, we never would have met such fantastic people nor learned so much aboutt his beautifuland diverse country.Thank you, Earthstompers, for making it such an easy choice for us on how to spend our precious vacation time, and introducing us to people with whom we hope to have a lifetime connection!"

While in Capetown, we decided to tour the Western Cape, and had originally decided to rent a car. Basedon the driving on the left side of the road thing, at the last minute, we decided to seek a tour guide who could take us from place to place. On one day's notice, Earthstompers developed a sight seeing plan for the Garden Route which included stops and lodging on the Indian Ocean and wine country. We were extremely grateful for the quality of their planning and the flexibility shown as we made our way across the country. The best part was our guide, Roelf, who was superb in every respect. He was extremely knowledgeable on a broad range of subjects and was able to do complex planning on the fly in order to maximize our time. Sometimes on travel you meet an individual who is so special that you know : \"no one could do this better.\" Such was the experience we had with Roelf. This phase of our vacation, thanks to Earthsompers, was a tremendous experience, and we are very grateful!"

From the smooth behind the scene admin to the lovely guide there is nothing about this tour that I could really fault. My garden route tour kicked off on the 10th of January with Nicole as our guide and from that day to the very last on tour the fun and excitement never stopped. From beautiful scenery to the down right crazy activities (i.e. bungy jumping), this tour has it all. We opted to stay in Guesthouses on the tour and their location and standards were great; clean, beautifully decorated and quite spacious. Although the tour involves a lot of activities during the day, we didn\u2019t feel rushed to get through anything and even had time in the afternoon and evenings to meet some of the locals and experience the best the towns we were staying in had to offer. Nicole our guide was like a fountain of knowledge and really went out of her way to accommodate any of our needs. If you like meeting new people, like having a little adventure in your life and you\u2019re prepared to be entertained by an absolutely outstanding guide look no further; you have found your tour! I highly recommend this tour to anyone who would like to see the best South Africa has to offer in a limited time frame. I was born and raised in South Africa for 11 years and I never knew as much as I do now, and it\u2019s all thanks to Earthstompers :)"

For the prices we paid i would definitely recommend this company, you get your moneys worth and much much more! We stayed in the backpackers accommodation which to be honest was much nicer than the guest houses because they were all situated on the beach, so that was perfect! all the accommodations were clean, the people were extremely friendly and we had a great time!The groups are really small so this makes it much better to get to know people, and more possibility for Hendrik to be flexible with the timings and do whatever you want to do.This tour provides the best of the Garden Route tour and when you finish you will be amazed at how much you manged to cover in just 6 days!The least thing i liked was the fact that i didn't have more time in my travels to do a longer tour! :-)Thanks for an amazing time!!Nand"

Nicole was young, vivacious and more than anything, she was knowledgable. We enjoyed the Garden Tour with Nicole so much that we enlisted her services on our return to Capetown. She entertained us virtually 12 hours a day and because of her flexibility, she made our every wish come true. We stayed in up scaled backpackers, traveled in a Mercedes van and were able to go from a picnic in the park to eating in the finest restaurants with only a phone call by our guide. She even juggled activities, when part of the group wanted to split. She was willing to drop off and pick up each of us at different times and locations. Just as a side note, we found Earthstompers by searching overland tours. We hired them on blind trust and they were honest, reasonable and the service was incredible. Would I recommend EARTHSTOMPERS?

I had done this tour with Hendrik in 2008 and came back with such amazing pictures and stories that it inspired my friend from Australia to visit the country and check out the tour. When I booked our tickets, I thought it would be the same kind of trip that I had done previously - boy was I wrong! The tour has been refined and while the\"good 'ol favourites\" were there, a few new options were also added. There was so much more to do and see on this trip and Hendrik actually joined us on a few of the activities too :) Hendrik was so committed to ensuring that we really enjoyed our trip that he even adjusted the schedule slightly to accommodate changes for two people in our tour AND tried to get us booked in for paragliding (not on the itinerary at all). We didn't end up doing the paragliding because the weather refused to cooperate - no wind one day and then it decided to rain buckets the next day.My friend and I opted to stay at guesthouses but I never dreamed that we'd staying four star guest lodges (that's the highest rating possible). Believe me when I say that the guest house option is well worth the extra payment! The backpacker places were also really fun and we half regretted not choosing the backpacker accommodation (well, until we went back to our rooms and enjoyed the amazing views and extra comforts). Oh and those with specific dietary needs, you can rest easy. The Earthstompers team really go that extra mile to ensure you really enjoy your time with them.The only gripe that I have is that the tour was over way too quickly. The 6 day tour + Addo adventure is by far the best way to see South Africa when you have budget and time constraints for locals and tourists alike. I highly recommend it to any and everyone :)"

I was traveling alone and short on ime so preferred to do a tour rather than hire a car to explore the Garden Route. It was very well organised, saw all the major attractions and there were lots of optional extras eg bungy jumping, skydiving, shark cage diving, whale watching, tree top canopy tour etc. The tour guide, Hendrik, a Mossel Bay local, was very knowledgeable, friendly and flexible. The accommodation was fantastic, was very impressed with the standard of hostels/guest houses. Most meals were included and there was plenty of free time to explore the towns on your own if you wanted. I would recommend doing the elephant park optional extra, Getting so close to and being able to touch orphaned elephants in a small reserve was an amazing experience. I got to ride an ostrich, explore Cango Caves, fly through the trees with Tsitsikamma Tree Top Canopy Tours, feed elephants and spot whales in Hermanus to name but a few highlights. All in all a great tour with something to suit everyone."

The trip far exceeded my expectations and I had a amazing time.Earthstompers is operated by a friendly, cool, yet professional local guy named Hendrik, who has been guiding for a number of years and really knows his stuff. He can tailor the trip to the individual's needs and offers various accommodation options including dorm, single room and guest-house.Almost all meals are including and I especially liked the huge buffet at the game lodge.I addition to seeing the amazing Garden Route/Route 62 and visiting Oudtshoorn, Wilderness, Knysna, Plettenberg Bay, Tsitsikamma , Mossel Bay, Cape Agulhas and Hermanus, included in the trip are visits to a winery, Cango Caves, an ostrich farm, canoeing, a game reserve and a wildlife centre. Optional extras include the world;s highest commercial bungy jump (216 metres - fantastic!!!), sand-boarding, a tree top canopy tour, skydiving and shark cage diving.I would thoroughly recommend this tour as it had the feel of a private tour, yet was very well priced. Keep up the good work Hendrik!"

I didn't know what to expect as far as where the cooking class would take place, how many people would be joining us, etc. It turned out to be only my mother and I and we got to cook with Cass at her house! It was honestly one of my favorite experiences during our short, event-packed, 4 days in Cape Town. Cass was so welcoming, my mother and I made 4 traditional South African dishes (recipes that she has been credited with documenting so as not to be lost, which I think is so awesome) with Cass' instruction. Afterwards, we all sat down and ate lunch together. This is all right in her home, so intimate, and so much more than I expected from a cooking class. Our tour guide, Pam, was also with us the entire day. I cannot speak highly enough of her. She picked us up from our hotel and along the drive toward Cass's house, gave us a history of Cape Town itself and also what is known as Cape Malay cuisine. She is such an interesting woman and you can tell she genuinely loves the city and all that it encompasses! She took us by Truth Coffee before we went to see Cass, definitely worth checking out... It's got an industrial feel with the staff in steam-punk, Mad Max style attire; coffee is to die for as well, order the flat white, you won't be disappointed. Overall, you get a great history of the city without it feeling touristy, and, if you have a culinary interest, you cannot ask for a better experience than cooking with Cass. Bottom line, I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Cape Town, phenomenal experience!"

It was to have been a half day, but there was so much to see and do it went beyond our scheduled time. With Ryan as our guide we received a cultural as well as culinary taste of the city. We visited Truth Coffee, Charly's Bakery, District 6 Museum, the Spice Market, and ended our tour in one of the lovely pastel homes on Cape Maley Bo-Kapp for a cooking class. What I liked about our tour with Cape Fusion and Ryan was that it was customized for us. It wasn't selected from a list of prearranged tours so there were no crowds of other tour groups to contend with. We were on a schedule but not bound by it, the tour could be altered as we went along. It was more like a local person finding what interest us then fulfilling our request. This is the way to see Cape Town, a small independent company that works on quality rather than quanity. That being said, you will need to book well in advance in order to have this unique experience."

Our guide Pam was a total professional clearly puts her heart, soul & passion in not only showing out of the way boutique food options but top restaurants, a inner city winery, street food, cafe specialities and a unique insight into the history & culture of Cape Town. The reception that Pam received clearly showed the standing she is held in. We tasted amazing coffee, cheese, middle eastern street food, sweets, a wine tasting, curry in a hollowed out bread roll & traditional african meal. Also we were given time to peruse a street market, view, purchase & donate (our choice) wire framed beaded animals from a non profit business set up to support abandoned women, a local business of collective artists who construct wire animals some of which are beaded, all of which were amazing. You also get a geographic appreciation of city central including historical buildings. A highlight was when leaving Davids bus station roof restaurant & telling him I was from New Zealand he wanted to know about the rugby haka so I did part of a haka for him. The absolute delight on his face was priceless. Memories for life. Thanks so much Pam for sharing your insiders knowledge with us. Do yourself a favour & take this tour. Amazing.

Doing the foodie tour with Pam of Cape Fusion Tours is hands down my favorite time spent on the entire trip. It's the part of the trip that comes to mind most often. Taking the foodie tour with Pam is a great way to get the lay of the land. It will save you so much time later in your trip!!!She takes you everywhere and knows everyone. She introduces you to the locals, provides history, and by the end of the day you have a good idea of where you want to eat for the rest of your time in Capetown. She takes the guess work out of where and what to eat. I wish I had more time to experience more places. As an entrepreneur, I so loved learning about all the stories of how each person that we met came to owning their business. I loved learning about their ethnic diversity that makes up Capetown. Pam is incredibly knowledgable. She is very strategic about where she takes you and is good about listening to you and figuring out which restaurants are the best fit for you. As a solo traveler this was also a great way to experience Capetown with someone who felt like a friend. This tour is fantastic for a true foodie enthusiast."

Essentially, her tours are like going someplace really interesting and having a friend drive you around to all the cool spots and tell you all about everything you need to know. We learned a ton and had a lot of really cool experiences. The food was all amazing and we met a lot of really cool people. Pam is also very flexible - she was perfectly happy to hang around and wait while we hiked some extra trails at Cape Point and drove over to take triumphant pictures when we were done! All in all the tours were absolutely great - experiences you wouldn't get any other way. Highly recommended!! After receiving all sorts of terrifying warnings about how we should never walk in Cape Town (I went for work and got automatic security emails), we were a little intimidated at the thought of exploring on our own. With Pam, we got about 17000 steps each day - to let you know we really did explore a ton of the area and we definitely worked up an appetite for all the awesome food. Other people of course wouldn't have to walk so much if they didn't want to, but we really enjoyed it."

Our cooking class was filled with laughter, singing and dancing. Mama Lindie is fabulous, feisty and so kind. While we waited for some of our dishes to finish, Victor taught us about life in the township as well as Xhosa traditions before we got a chance to meet with the students at the cooking school. It was such a pleasure to sit down with the students, hear about their aspirations once they complete the course and talk about something we were all passionate about - good food. At the end of the day, we sat down together, feasted on our meal and shared stories. On the trip back into town, all of us were raving how the experience wildly surpassed expectations and was a highlight of the trip.Do yourself a favor and book this experience with Pam.

This was a walking tour of central Cape Town for the first 6 hours, and then a trip up to the top of Table Mountain.Pam was extremely knowledgeable about the Cape Town food scene, but also about the history of Cape Town and South Africa in general.We visited many small local food purveyors, such as a bacon shop, cheese shop, chocolate shop and central Cape Town winery. We stopped at a local woman's house where we were given a hands on demonstration of how to make samosas, and then enjoyed the fruits of our labor. We also visited the central train station, including the rooftop food stalls, where Pam had one of the purveyors give a talk about African food. Our last part of the tour was a cable car ride up to the top of Table Mountain. All in all I would not hesitate in recommending this tour, but perhaps ask Pam to tweak it just a bit. I think the time spent at the local woman's home could be shortened by about 20 minutes, and the time spent with the chef at the food stall on the roof of the train station needs to be shortened as well. The chef is very personable and enthusiastic about African foods, but he went on for about 15 minutes, when 5 minutes would have sufficed. But again, as I am sure Pam would tailor a tour for you as you request, I have no problem recommending her."

My 14 year old daughter and I had the most wonderful opportunity to visit South Africa and were booked for a half day Foodie Tour with Ryan. Seriously jet lagged and in awe of our beautiful surroundings, Ryan picked us up right on time and introduced us to Cape Town. We started off in colorful Bo-Kaap trying out some Cape Malay pastries, He then took us to two venues where we could witness traditional African beading, one of which was an awesome non-profit shop that enriches the lives of less fortunate native women while realizing their talents. It was great to bring home some pieces of art while supporting a good cause. Moving ahead, we enjoyed ice cream bunny-chow (SO GOOD FOR BREAKFAST) and other goodies, then finishing up with traditional pap and samp, curry and meeting some wonderful natives along the way. Ryan was incredibly laid back, informative, very friendly and the perfect guide to show us places and foods we wouldn't have gotten a chance to experience on our own. Thank you Ryan and Pam for taking good care of us and sharing your gorgeous city with us. We will be back!"

We started off with a fantastic lunch and wine tasting at Contantia Glen,made a quick stop at Groot Constantia and then went to our favourite High Constantia. Our last stop was at Steenberg. Our second day was a full day in the old wine regions. Ryan was very friendly and easy going. He joined us for lunch so that we could visit with him and gain as much information as we could. He is very knowledgable about the regions and Cape Town. His tour was very flexible and we were able to add a tour of a car museum and one last stop at Meerlust which was our favourite for sure. Our third day with Ryan was a tour of Cape Town starting with a stop at Truth Coffee, then the District 6 museum and then to our township cooking class. As we were cooking Ryan took our cameras and got some great shots for us. He then drove us around the township and then to the spice shop with a final stop at the butcher shop to purchase biltong. Ryan was a great tour guide and we would recommend him in a heart beat. He was very flexible and altered the tour to suit your likes as he got to know youThanks for 3 great days in Cape Town!"

I'm not usually one for guided tours however when you have a guide as knowledgeable, well connected and fun as Pam it makes it worthwhile! We did a day tour of the Stellenboch wine region with her and it was such a great experience. Her passion and knowledge about wine, the local wine winemakers, South African history and politics is really impressive. If you're into food and wine I think a Cape Fusion Tour is a must-do if visiting Cape Town."

This time we have done 2 and have the city tour still to look foward to. Her itinerary is always fabulous and her knowledge of each winery and all the best restaurants is amazing. It really is like a day out with an old friend. A perfect 2 days. We have managed anything from 4 to 7 farms in a day, it's up to you to decide what pace and how much tasting you want. As we visit a lot of farms that need prebooking, letting Pam sort it all out if great. Pick up and drop off for a wine tour is a.must and her vehicles are spotless. Cannot recommend Cape Fusion enough but book early as she has a lot of happy repeat customers like us"

We were recently in Cape Town for a wedding and went on a day tour to the wineries of Stellenboch and Franschhoek with a group of friends. This is my second time in Cape Town and second time doing a food and wine tour with Cape Fusion Tours. The great thing about Pam is she personalises the itinerary to you and has genuine depth of knowledge and insight about the region, the people, as well as the wineries, the wine and, of course, the winemakers. You come away have learnt something as well as having had a gastronomic adventure. On the tour we just did we went to some big wineries and some boutique wineries and at all of them we had a unique 'insiders' experience, not just a cellar door drop. As global travellers, we have been on several foodie tours and experiences, and without doubt, the personal touch, knowledge and friendliness of Pam and the Cape Fusion Tours team make this experience world class (not to mention the great wines and restaurants of the Cape!)"

Pam picked us up at my hotel in Cape Town (including my daughter & her friend who are in Cape Town for six months on co-op from their U.S. university) and our first stop was Babylonstoren. It was early so no wine-tasting here but Pam wanted us to experience the organic farm that is located on this winery. We arrived in time for a guided tour given by one of their knowledgeable employees and saw some beautiful sites also. You can lodge here and some of the rooms have kitchens. You are allowed to pick anything from the gardens and use. It was a great first stop! After that we were off to La Motte Winery for our winetasting. This is my first experience and it was fantastic. The wines were delicious and Pam is very well-versed about the winemaking process, the background on the winery and the history of the region. And we bought some great wines at great prices! Afterwards we went to lunch at La Petite Ferme. How delicious and what a stunningly beautiful locale!! We walked around the little town and did a little shopping before heading to our next winetasting in Stellenbosch. That winery closed a little early that day so we didn't have an opportunity for a second winetasing but that was really okay. Between the winetasting at La Motte and lunch, I was definitely feeling it! We walked around thte quaint streets of the Stellenbosch shopping area and learned more about the region from Pam.I highly recommend Pam as your wine region tour guide. She was fun, energetic and very knowledgeable."

Brought us to a wonderful restaurant/brewery/chocolate tasting, where we enjoyed spectacular views while enjoying our meal...she also explained South African cuisine while we were eating.

I can't wait to try out my new recipes on friends. Day 2 was Saturday so a must stop, especially for foodies, is the Biscuit Mill. Not only was this a treat for the eyes, ears and taste buds, it provided many cultural insights in just one place. We then spent the rest of the day driving down the coast, visiting the Cape of Good Hope, seeing the penguins and other sea life. Day 3 was a wonderful visit to the wine country. This was a day filled with gorgeous natural scenery, Cape Dutch architecture, good wine and even a chocolate tasting.When we set out on our adventure, Anine had certain things in mind but as the three days went on she modified plans as she got to know what I liked and that I wanted to pack as much as possible into the time I had in her town. And, she knew everyone - from the gentleman at the District 6 Museum whose home had been in the District to various vendors at the Biscuit Mill, the doorman at the coffee shop and wine makers.

Anine was our guide for the day and she was brilliant. Nothing was too much trouble. I would highly recommend them if you want a wonderful, relaxed and enjoyable day wine tasting. Anine is a lovely and lively lady who pays attention to detail. The extra touches are what makes this company do special. We did a wine and olive oil tasting (fantastic!) and then a wine and chocolate pairing before lunch at La Petite Ferme. We did our final post lunch tasting at a place practically next door. It did cost a little more than a few places I looked but the service was exceptional and absolutely worth it. If we return to Cape Town I would definitely use them for another of their tours as they all sound great! Thanks for a great experience."

Excellent food walking adventure with Anine from \u2018Cape Fusion Tours\u2019 which offered so much more than just a foodie experience. We strolled the streets of Cape Town and were introduced to the melting pot of cultures, history, ate a variety of street foods & met some wonderfully interesting people. Such as Christophe, owner of a wine tasting establishment \u2018Dorrance\u2019 located in the courtyard of a gorgeous boutique establishment \u2018Cape Heritage Hotel\u2019 where the oldest vine in the Southern Hemisphere still thrives & David a highly respected local chef who specialises in traditional black South African food such as Pap & Samp & Beans for the locals. An interesting & revealing encounter where he explained with passion & pride the basic food from his & Nelson Mandelas heritage then prepared us tapas size portions of his home style fare. Enroute we explored various street markets and visited bead metal & craft workshops 'Monkey Biz' and 'Streetwires.' Our guide seemed to know everyone and couldn\u2019t have been more helpful and friendly. The tour went at our own pace, stopping longer at various places whenever we wanted. Thoroughly enjoyed the colourful houses of the Bo Kaap region, and a stop at a street punk style coffee place \u2018Truth\u2019 an artisan coffee house, where we were shown around and sampled the best coffee we had during our visit to Cape Town. There were only two of us so the cost was obviously more per head than if we were part of a bigger group, but was still excellent value for money\u2026.thank you Anine for such a sensational memorable day!"

With Pam you get to know the real spirit of Cape Town, and taste the authentic food. We started with a cooking class in a home in Bo-Kaap, we walked through the heart of the city, and stopped to sample food every step of the way. Pam is so fun, with a great sense of humor, and great knowledge of everything in Cape Town. We spend our 2nd day with Pam on a Peninsula tour, with stops at Cape Point, Boulders Beach, Kalk bay, Chapman's Peak drive, among the highlights. By the end of our 2nd day we felt we had a life long friend, and did not want to let her go. The 2 days with Pam are truly the highlight of our entire week in Cape Town. Everyone needs to book a tour with Pam, you will love every minute of it!!!"

Pam is passionate and knowledgeable about Cape Town and its surrounding areas. We spent four fun filled and exciting days with her. She really paid attention to all the tiny details and listened to all of our preferences regarding the sights we wanted to see (Table Mountain, Robben Island, Kirstenboch, etc). In addition to showing us the items on our To Do List, she also provided us with additional stops along the way which were the cherries, sprinkles, etc. on top of our fantastic touring experience with her. We loved visiting Bead Works, Truth Coffee, as well as sampling \"Bunny Chow\" at the local coffee shop. She also knew the great gay spots which we wish we just had more time to play. Visiting Constania and eating and tasting wine at 1868 was a true treat!Pam is an exceptional, knowledgeable, friendly, bubbly,and AWESOME tour guide! On our last day with her Pam took us to great shops to do some shopping and my girlfriend was looking to buy a leather handbag and sure enough Pam saves the day to a shop called Mungo & Jemima (South African Market) Loved this stop. It was super Delaire and surrounding area of Stellenbosch amazing VIEWS."

My wife and I enjoy some \"off the beaten path\" experiences while traveling, in addition to trying a lot of the local cuisine where we visit. Pam's Cape Town Eats Gourmet Walking Tour definitely ticked both of these boxes. She picked us up at our hotel at 9 and returned us several hours later both culturally enriched and gastronomcally satiated. We walked through many different neighborhoods learning about the history and culture of the areas and sampling their foods.These were items we were not likely to have found on our own. From a great potsticker by a famous chef's \"Street Food\" offshoot and a famous gourmet coffee roaster to bobotie, bunny chow, samp and beans, pap, chakalaka, koeksisters, and many more- many at street stands or very small out of the way locations. But it was also not just about the food (although that was admittedly my first attraction). Pam also took us to a few venues like Monkey Biz and Streetwires which are organizations that are starting to allow disadvantaged locals to begin to earn some income, in an area where unemployment is rife, by selling craft items they make. All great efforts and wonderful causes. All in all this was a great experience. Pam is engaging, very knowledgeable, and most of all just a lot of fun! I can't recommend this enough."

Pam wasn't at all fazed by my pescatarian dietary choices and walking around this beautiful city, nibbling and discussing the history, people, politics and architecture is a fantastic way to get a real feel for what's going on. And it's so great that she's on such friendly terms with the culinary innovators too - you get behind-the-scenes tours as she strides round the back of everywhere!Day two - wine lands. Following my preferences, Pam took me round Constantia and we had lunch at the simply stunning Overture before a whistle-stop tour of Stellenbosch. Beautiful landscapes, in-depth history (both ancient and more contemporary), great architecture and of course simply delicious food and wine. Pam is fantastic company: passionate, knowledgable and friendly. As a solo 40-something woman traveller, I really felt I made the best choice possible to introduce myself to the area.

The first tour with Pam was beyond amazing so I wondered how she could possibly top my trip in 2012. Well no surprise - the trip was the most synchronistic memorable trip of my life. Considering I just turned 50 and have traveled extensively, this tour with Pam rises to the top of my memorable trips. Pam gives you so many options - you just go with what feels right for the day. She makes a plan but allows for detours and surprises all along the way. I did an olive oil tasting - love OO but hate olives. Not after trying Morgenster's olives and olive paste. I love SA olives! Coffee, wine, food you name it - Pam knows the best places in the Cape. Woodstock was pure entertainment from an artistic perspective as well as wine and coffee. I saw whales in Hermosa Beach - ate food everywhere. Just tell Pam what you like and she will find it and more. Don't even get me going on the desserts! Book a multiple day tour with Pam. You will not be able to get enough for Cape Town unless you do. You will become a repeat client. The best advice I can give - book far in advance and I promise you will have the time of your life!! And laugh - oh you will laugh. Pam - see you in October of 2015. Cheers from America (Golden CO). LOL. Oh - this trip was my total disconnect. Pam posted pictures on FB everyday so my family knew I was safe. Take your camera and comfortable shoes."

It was the best decision ever! Pam was very communicative and asked for our input about what we were interested in seeing, doing, and eating, and she planned us three wonderful days. First day was the Cape of Good Hope, Boulders Beach Penguins, a lovely Mothers Day Lunch at Harbour House and all sorts of other little goodies tucked in between. That day we had Anine as our driver and associate guide and really enjoyed her as well. Next day was the winelands. Along the way we had tastings of beer, chocolate, cheese and wine and saw the beautiful wineland countryside. A lovely late lunch at La Petite Ferme followed, then an interesting visit to a car museum. Day 3 was a walking and tasting tour of Cape Town, starting in Bo-Kapp and ending at the Mount Nelson Hotel. We tasted all sorts of delicious traditional foods like samosas and bunny chow, stopped at a new winery tasting room, and also visited several Interesting crafty shops such as Monkeybiz and Streetwires. We were also treated to a visit with David, who makes the most delicious stew with Pap and Samp, and sells it from a kiosk at the Transit Station!Pam was very communicative, prompt, friendly, fun and outgoing. She adapted to our interests and was flexible if we happened upon something that we found interesting.

Pam McOnie is an ebullient sparkplug of a personality and the ideal guide to take my partner and me through the Cape Winelands. About a month prior to flying to Cape Town for vacation, I contacted her company, Cape Fusion Tours, about booking a Cape Peninsula tour for which she was not available. She immediately referred me to Lesley Cox of Amber Tours, who did a spectacular job. Pam made a smart, customer-first business move because when Lesley turned out to be unavailable for the Cape Winelands tour, she referred me back to Pam without hesitation. I think this clever networking all turned out for the best because Pam certainly knows her local wines and describes the area with great enthusiasm throughout the tour. A full day cost the two of us cost us R 2500 (approximately $240), and this consisted primarily of traversing between the two key towns in the region, Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, presumably the Napa and Sonoma of South Africa.We made stops at three wineries plus the Delaire Graff Estate to enjoy the eclectic art amid elegant surroundings as well as lunch at La Petite Ferme, a popular, rustic-elegant restaurant with a lovely hilltop view of the vineyards and the Berg River Valley. Our first winery stop was at the Waterford Estate, an exquisite chateau-like setting in the Blaauwklippen Valley, where we were served a satisfying wine and chocolate pairing in their courtyard followed by a brief tour. Next was the Stark-Cond\u00e9 winery in the Jonkershoek Valley, where we were taken to a charming small island in the middle of a lake where they conducted their tastings. Last was the family-owned Fairview winery famous for their cheeses and where in fact, we were served eight cheese bites to go with all the wine samplings. Pam certainly demonstrated a great deal of stamina in not trying any of the wines since she was driving. I would definitely recommend her services without question since she placed focus on our interests first."

We had a great time and shared many amusing events with an endless variety of things to see and do from traditional to trendy, quirky to the totally unexpected which all contributed to a memorable experience.

The cooking school, which gives young people the chance to find meaningful employment, is inspirational and we felt honoured to be a part of that, even for just a day. An amazing experience, and one we will surely not forget."

Pam came highly recommended by a friend of a friend who had visited Cape Town several years back, so I made arrangements to spend a day visiting wineries in Franschhoek and Stellenbosch with her on my recent trip. Pam was a fantastic tour guide (it felt more like talking with an old friend than with a guide) and her tour exceeded my expectations in every way. She is a wealth of knowledge about South African history and politics as well as the ins and outs of Cape Town, especially as it pertains to food and wine. As a passionate foodie and wine lover, she takes her research seriously and is constantly keeping up to date with the restaurant and winery scene. Her tour is extremely comprehensive and flexible and she works hard to cater the tour to her clients' interests and requests. Additionally, Pam was quick to respond via email when booking the tour and followed up afterwards with a list of the restaurants she had mentioned throughout the day as well as others to check out. If you are looking for a fun, comprehensive tour with a professional guide who is very in the know about what's happening in Cape Town, definitely reach out to Pam."

I came across Pam\u2019s details \u2013 like all good finds \u2013 though a recommendation, a \u2018friend of a friend\u2019 thing. I wanted to get as much out of my trip to Cape Town as possible and get all the \u2018must see\u2019 things done as well as picking up some \u2018insider\u2019 tips too. I emailed Pam from the UK and she was quick to respond. I managed to get a walking/foodie tour lined up and set a date. On the day, Pam turned up bang on time, big smiles and lots of laughs. I knew that it was going to be a good day and \u2013 usefully \u2013 Pam had warned us (against the threat of death) not to have breakfast!We headed off in Pam\u2019s (new and A/Cd) van and were quickly parked up in the wonderfully coloured streets and ready to get walking. Our first stop saw as getting stuck in to a tasty Samosa, a sweet doughnut-y (sorry Pam, forgotten all the names!) and a fruity, milky drink to wash it all down with. Lovely tastes and something very different. The tour got better and better. We \u2018snacked as we went\u2019 and Pam \u2013 clearly passionate about her great city \u2013 gave us the very best tips that we\u2019d go on to use throughout the remainder of our trip. Every corner provided a nugget of history or a shop to re-visit. The tour is quite a lengthy one but Pam knows exactly how far you can go without a pit-stop. These were well-measured and at the right pace for us. The fact that nibbly bits/food are included in the tour cost means no raking round for change and showing everybody that you \u2018might\u2019 be a daft tourist!All in all, a great experience and certainly one that I\u2019d recommend.

I have come to know the area very well and regard it as a home from home. You might be wondering why then am I still using a local guide each year?The answer is really simple. Pamela McOnie is not just a local guide, but she must be the best connected guide, and the most enthusiastic foodie in South Africa. A wine day with her tends to involve not just tastings, but drives through some of the most picturesque scenery on earth, cellars tours and sometimes even meeting wine-makers. Pam is exceptionally knowledgeable about South African food and wines.Cape Town is not one of those places that you can turn up at the last minute and expect to dine anywhere, as we found on our first trip there - we ended up eating in our hotel most nights, as everywhere worth dining was enormously booked up. Now Pam books restaurants for us, and they will often be top flight, not-what-you-know-but-whom-you-know hard to get in to places, and on top of that she generally books us the table with the best view. If every destination had a Pam, the world would be a more enjoyable place."

Pam McOnie's local knowledge and bubbly personality makes all the difference between a reasonable stay and an exceptional one. She took us to some amazing little boutique vineyards in Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, which we would never have found on our own. That she knows the winemakers personally made it an even more unique experience. Learning about the fascinating history of our country whilst being driven through some of the most beautiful scenery was a highlight. I am definitely booking a day with Pam soon again; I need to thirst my quench both for knowledge and Sauvignon Blanc!"

Not only did she bring us to some phenomenal places to explore for wine and food, she was also extremely knowledgeable about the area which added to the experience.Last month we were back in Cape Town and Pam took us to the Biscuit Mill! Wow, what a wonderful event and way to experience a taste of Cape Town. A recommended must if you're visiting on a Saturday. Our next stop was Eziko for a cooking class on preparing the local cuisine. Mama Lindy was such a treat as the teacher as well as Victor who started the school.Pam creates a unique experience and is a pleasure to spend the day with and learn more about the Cape. Thank you for a wonderful time, again!"

I was speaking at a conference and a one day tour was a wonderful gift from the organisers. Pam is incredibly knowledgeable about the history and politics of South Africa and the Cape Region. Her explanations illustrated by her experiences of student life in the 1990s provided an insight into the dramatic changes that have happened in this beautiful country over the last 20 years. Cape Town does not advertise its changeable weather but the rain and wind at Hermanus did not dampen my enthusiasm for the views of the Southern Right Whales lolling around in the bay a few metres from the shore. Pam seems happiest when discussing food and wine as we toured the estates - her real passion. If you are a foodie or have an interest in wine then I cannot imagine a better guide to the region."

She was extremely flexible and accomodated all three of our interests. My mom and sister didn't want to join in on wine tasting but wanted to see the winelands. Pam arranged a chocolate tasting for us followed by a wine tasting. While I was enjoying the wine, my mom and sister were able to view glass blowing!!! Pam also was more than happy to find Kodak moments for us and insisted on taking pictures with us in them!!! She was very personable and funny and made all of the history of Cape Town come to life.

We were introduced to Pam and Cape Fusion Tours by our hosts at the Welgelegen Hotel in Cape Town. My wife and I truly enjoy traveling the US and the world to find small boutique vineyards. Pam picked us up for a full day tour of Stellenbosch and took us to Meerlust, Starke-Conde, Ernie Ells and Delaire Graff. Lunch was at the exquisite Overture restaurant at the Hidden Valley Winery. Each wine estate was wonderful and we were able to sit outside at all but Meerlust to take in the view and enjoy the wine sampling. We\u2019ve included some pictures and though we are shy about putting ourselves on TripAdvisor, just imagine us sitting at a comfortable table, our glasses full of delicious reds and whites, and looking out at the scenery that you can see in these photos. But truth be told, wine was only part of the Cape Fusion experience. Pam McOnie has an encyclopedic knowledge of South African history and geography and combined with her always positive personality was the perfect tour guide. For the better and the worse she gave us candid explanations into Cape Town history and answered all of our questions. And she shared with us recommendations for the rest of our time in Cape Town that made the honeymoon even more memorable. Lunch at La Colombe. A visit to Harbour House in Kalk Bay. The cheetah rescue experience at the Spier Wine Farm, just to name a few. And for the Johannesburg leg of our trip she introduced us to a local tour guide there named Kenny Letshesa Takalo. I could write a whole rave review about that experience alone but this story is about Pam and Cape Fusion. I would simply say we so enjoyed learning Johannesburg history from Kenny that we extended our honeymoon a day in order to spend not one, but two days in nearby Soweto. Think about that for a moment\u2026 But like I said before, the Cape Fusion experience was more than just getting out to great wine estates and enjoying the vineyards. It was the genuine desire of Pam McOnie to help you learn what makes South Africa and Cape Town such a unique and beautiful place and to help you make the most of your visit there\u2026while enjoying a great lunch and a bottle or two\u2026or three\u2026or four. :)"

He took our family of 5 on two private day trips, Cape Peninsula and District Six/Langa Township.He managed to combine his vast knowledge of the area as a local with an easy ambience and attention to detail making our tours tailored to our wishes and seamless in management. But we had fun too!! And learnt so much. The Cape Tour was fabulous, with personal touches such as providing cold water bottles, showing us where he surfed as a teenager, taking us to the non-tourist side of boulders beach, reserving us a great view lunch table at Cape Point restaurant, giving us a choice of wine estates, even keeping us calm as a wayward baboon came to check us for food whilst watching the ostriches!! All the while giving us snippets of local info, historical references and current political news. The tour to District Six and Langa though was something else. He introduced us to a whole subject matter that we had very limited knowledge of previously, and it opened our eyes to the huge traumatic politics of apartheid in this area of SA.David took us to the museum which was fascinating, and then a car tour of the area including the now very desolate district six and showed us with very precise knowledge where the old tracks and houses were, where the remaining churches and mosques fitted in.David has a very good friend and working colleague, Odwa, a wonderful and clever 26yr old man who was brought up in Langa Township, and still lives there. Odwa took us on a walking tour of the township, he reassured us of our safety and of our being very welcome, and that the local people would be very pleased to open up their homes and show us how they live. It blew our minds away seeing all the housing/shelters and what the township means to the people who dwell there. We visited the orphanage and saw the children's beautiful and fabulous welcoming dance. It was truly humbling. Would thoroughly recommend taking your children there and meeting Odwa and hearing the story of Langa. "

David was very quick to reply and in no time we had agreed for pick-up at the apartments I was staying at, along with an outline itinerary for a private tour. We are a family of 5. We have 3 sons, one disabled and two other 'adults'.The day before the tour, David contacted me as the weather forecast wasn't good for the day of the trip, and offered to reschedule for a day or so later, when the weather may be better. Whilst appreciated, we had other arrangements and needed to keep with the original date.We were picked up by our driver and guide, Karen, and we again agreed loosely what we wanted to do and where we wanted to go. Of course, no-one controls the weather, and it was pretty awful from 11ish onwards. So, as we were driving, Karen made suggestions of other things which we could do, which were really good. For example, we visited an ostrich farm and had a moment feeding them. We managed to prevent the big birds from eating our hands!We made it to Cape Colony and the lighthouse in the dry and agreed with Karen that we would walk from the lighthouse to the Cape of Good Hope where she would pick us up. When at the top of the hill at the lighthouse, the heavens really opened. We travelled back down on the funicular wondering what we would do about the walk and the rain, but then saw that Karen had waited as she thought the weather looked a lot like rain. What a relief!We went on and had lunch in a really nice restaurant on the sea front and then wanted to go on to see the penguins at Boulders Beach. It was still raining really hard, so Karen drove us as close as she could to the entrance - probably closer than she should have! - so we wouldn't get too wet. Fortunately, the weather eased up enough for us to see the penguins.We next agreed to change a visit to the gardens to a visit to a vineyard, which I was very happy about, and Karen obviously knew the staff there and arranged for us to have a special extra treat which was otherwise not available as a tasting.It also has to be said that Karen was good at informing us about where we were going, what we were looking at, some of the history of the areas we visited, and was very friendly and approachable regarding questions we had.So a great day. Did the weather spoil it? Well, it tried but when you travel somewhere in their winter/wet season, you have to be prepared. Did the tour deliver? Yes, absolutely. Karen went above and beyond to make sure it did.And the key question - would we use African Blue Tours again? Absolutely right we would!"

            "review": "Cape Peninsula Tour with African Blue. We booked a day long Cape Peninsula Tour as part of our honeymoon in August 2016. From the very start, we knew we were onto a winner as the owner, David, took one look at my misguided clothing choices and promptly lent me his African Blue jacket for the tour to prevent me freezing throughout the day! Our guide, Duncan, was friendly and clearly knew Cape Town really well. He was constantly advising us of the key historic points relating to each of the city's attractions and was always volunteering to take photos of us for our scrapbook. Highlights of the tour had to be Boulders Beach for the penguins, Hout Bay for the seal colony boat trip, complete with eccentric locals feeding the seals at the dock, through to the climb to the lighthouse at the top of Cape Point. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend African Blue Day Tours to anyone visiting the city, and want to thank Duncan and David for their hospitality, knowledge and friendliness. Well done boys!"

It is difficult to keep this age happy and occupied but they had a ton of fun! We learned a lot of history of the area, saw and learned about many of the communities right outside of Capetown, had lunch at the Cape and saw the penguins. Everything was well planned and executed. I would recommend this tour to families for sure!Langa Township Tour: This was the highlight of our trip to Capetown!!! David was our tour guide and picked us up from the hotel (myself and my 3 kids ages 6, 8 and 10). We visited the District 6 museum and learned a bit of the history of the area. Then we met up with a resident of the Langa Township who took us on a walking tour. This was incredible, eye opening, fabulous...once in a lifetime. My kids are still talking about it. Absolutely a MUST for everyone. I was a little concerned before we went about safety but as I quickly learned the township is incredibly safe, the people are very warm and inviting and our guide made us feel right at home, even teaching us some words in the local language so we could better greet the people. We visited several different types of houses there and is was incredibly impactful. I think this is a MUST do for a trip to Capetown."

Having previously used African Blue for a couple of private, guided day tours with a group of friends a few years ago, we again booked the Cape Peninsular and Winelands full day tours when revisiting with some friends earlier this year. Our guide for both these trips was Matthew and as with the previous guides, he was excellent. Very knowledgeable and attentive without being over-imposing. He also tailored both trips during the day, based on our discussions and requests and I would have no hesitation recommending both him and the other African Blue tour guides as a great way to explore CT, the Western Cape and beyond in comfort (modern, comfortable and air conditioned fleet of vehicles) and flexibility, designed to each groups individual requests. Coupled with excellent communication and arrangements from David and the office team, the African Blue tours represent great value for money, providing fun-filled, informative and exciting full day tours."

They thought of absolutely everything, even bringing a car to the airport purely for our luggage!The Shark Diving was such an incredible experience, seeing a total of 5-6 different sharks. I would advise to definitely take sea sickness tablets, even if not normally seasick! Although you definitely feel better when in the cage...with your mind on other things!The Cape Duet Tour was also incredible, although obviously a lot to do in a day we fitted everything in, including a lovely lunch in Simons Town.I would recommend African Blue Tours to everyone and will definitely use them again when we return!"

He looked after us on all our day tours through out the week, shark cage diving which he picked us up at 3am! our cape point, chapman's peak and wine route trip, where we saw sea lions, penguins at boulder beach, the cape of good hope, cape point and wine tasting in the many vineyards. Matt was very informative and talked about all the history of place we drove through, stopped for photos at the best spots and showed us all the hidden gems Cape Town has to offer. We were very pleased with the service offered by African Blue."

We booked three tours through David and all were faultless. The starting point for any Cape Town adventure is a tour of the Peninsula. Matthew was our guide, a really friendly knowledgeable guy who was clearly very experienced and knew how best to avoid the crowds on the busiest day of the year. We then followed this up with a day trip to one of the safari reserves, which David transferred us to and from himself - an unforgettable experience and a great introduction for anyone wondering if they would like a safari or not... this will definitely make your mind up for you. It was great to chat to David on the drive there and back and find out lots about the culture and history of the region and the future of tourism in the region. Finally, David arranged a shark dive experience for us which was something I will never forget. This is arranged through an external company that David deals with, but the day was perfect. All three experiences were magical and I couldn't recommend David and his team enough. Even if you are not sure what you would like to do in Cape Town (or other parts of the country) i'd recommend getting in touch. David clearly knows both the country and the tourism industry inside out and i'd trust him to plan the vacation for you."

David was extremely helpful in helping us plan our time to include the sites of Cape Town that our pre-cruise tour did not include.Duncan our guide arrived punctually at our hotel and a group of 6 of us boarded one of the best tour vans I have been in. There was enough space for all our luggage and lots of leg room for all of us. It was clean and water was provided. Duncan was very knowledgeable, pleasant and handled our itinerary well. He got us to the main sites just before many of the large buses and even pointed out to us a better viewing platform to view the penguins. At the end of the day he took us and our luggage to our ship. As our boat was docked in port for the night the following day with detailed instructions from David we walked, bought our tickets and boarded our ferry to visit Robben Island. Thank you David and Duncan, your tour and help allowed us to maximize our time in Cape Town. I would recommend and suggest to any one who may be on one of the cruise pre-cruise tours to contact Africa Blue. Our experience was first rate."

He really added to the whole tour with his knowledge of the places we went, the history, and even gave us tips on a few of his hidden local gems you won't find in any of the guide books/sites (like going to Llandudno beach instead of some of the other tourist traps). He picked us up at 930a (we're late risers) and we headed down. He was willing to stop along the way for us to take pictures and knew when to push us along when we were spending too much time in one place. We need that some times.Warning - if traveling to Cape Town in general, but specifically Cape Point during the summer seasons, it WILL be windy. We're from the U.S. so we think Chicago is \"the windy city\" but Cape Town brings it to a whole new level. My wife and I agree we've never in our lives experienced anything like it. So be prepared, and don't wear lose fitting sunglasses or hats because they'll be gone before you know it. We stopped at the old and new lighthouses at Cape of Good Hope (previously \"Cape of Storms\" which is more accurate given the wind) and be sure to walk up the hill instead of the cable car because there are additional spots along the way to take pictures you won't get via the cable car. And exercise never hurt anybody :)We saw a fire along the way which have been happening at higher rates because of the drought so our drive went on a bit of a detour but we were fine with it. We stopped to visit the penguins (one of the windiest spots so wear long sleeves even if it's hot if you want to avoid getting pelted by the sand). The R65 per Adult admission was a bit high for a few minutes of looking at penguins, you basically pay that much to get good close up pictures. And on the way back, stopping at Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens is an absolute must! We could've spent all day there. Amazing foliage and views of the mountainside one way, and the city and beaches the other. All in all, a wonderful day. Thanks Matthew!"

Highlights were the penguins at Boulders Bay, relaxed lunch at Simon's Town, and Cape Point.Although the trip was enjoyable, there were a few things that could have been improved: the vehicle's suspension was poor and air con unit's generator pumped out warm air, rendering it useless. We opened a window so no big deal, but I'd have preferred air con to wind blowing in my face. Also, instructions to other members of our group were seemingly either unclear or not adhered to, so we ended up having lunch after 3pm. Again no big deal for us but you expect things on such a packed trip to run like clockwork and have lunch earlier than 3pm.A good trip and hopefully the few negatives can be improved for others in future."

It felt just right and very pleasant to invite our guide to join us for lunch. Would recommend him for anyone who wants to take the same tour. Trude & Asgeir"

We were extremely fortunate to end up being the only people on tour so it was like having our own private tour and time was efficiently utilized. Matt was very informative and new a lot about the Capetown area. I was able to book online and the owner responded very quickly suggested we change the tours around because of the weather forecast. Excellent company"

This was really memorable day with a highly knowledgeable local who really brought the area to life. A beautiful drive down one side of the peninsula with lots of opportunities to take photographs. There was a stop to take a boat trip to Seal Island which was a great experience. The highlight was the trip to Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope (learned these are different). A bit of a climb to the lighthouse, but well worthwhile. Lovely trip back with lunch near to the Penguin Colony at Boulders. Great guide, great company and a great day out."

That may be partly due to this not being the height of the tourist season. Our guide (Mathew) always had a smile and a nice comment. He was able to walk two novice wine tasters through the day without fail. Also, being that he provides many different tours, he was able to answer all of our wide-ranging questions. Mathew took us to many wonderful places including several vineyards of varying types, a beautiful lunch overlooking a valley of vineyards, and a couple of small towns where we could buy gifts for back home. While there was so much to see and do, Mathew never had us in a rush and we always seem to have more time. While I'm sure a group setting would be pretty fun, our private tour was catered perfectly for us (and we had no clue what we wanted to do when we set out in the morning)."

Payment was easily settled online via credit card. It was our first trip to Cape Town (except for one) and we were very much impressed with the general service standards in the city\u2019s tourism industry. This is very much so in the case of African Blue and the lodge we stayed (that\u2019s another story). We opted for the scheduled full day Cape Peninsula on Day 1 and a private Table mountain /City/ Kirstenbosch private tour on Day 2. Duncan, our guide for both days, was excellent. He was patient, professional and very knowledgeable in the areas of history, geography and nature. Places we visited offered both magnificent views & enriching experiences. Thanks again, Duncan, for the well conducted tours, the exciting ride up to Signal Hill to catch the noon gun and the beautiful sunset captured during the scenic ride back to Cape Town Central from Kirstenbosch. Kudos to David, who, having checked the weather forecasts, took the initiative and efforts (by mail & phone) to contact us to swap the date for our private tour from Wed to Tue to avoid missing the Table Mountain given the rainy forecast for Wed. Proven to be a wise decision and we were blessed with beautiful sunshine. If you are searching for a tour operator in Cape Town, look no further! On a side note, I would recommend to devote a full day to enjoy the sights and sounds of Table Mountain.  "

We contacted David who was able to change our arrangements at short notice so that we could do a half day tour and still do our trip to Robben Island.We were met from the boat after the Robben Island trip and taken in a very comfortable vehicle around the Cape Peninsula. We opted for a private tour and this was worth the extra cost to make it a truly personal experience. Our guide Duncan was very friendly and knowledgeable and had organised a fabulous lunch for us to get the tour underway. From there we saw all of the sights we hoped to see in the Peninsula and plenty of wildlife too. Duncan answered all of our questions and provided lots of other useful info as well as being on hand to take pictures for us at these wonderful locations. We found this a great way to see the Peninsula and would happily recommend."

He helped arrange how it would be best for us to spend that particular day in Cape Town. About 2 weeks before our arrival in Cape Town, another tour guide of ours had a schedule conflict. David was more than happy to move our originally scheduled Wednesday tour to Monday to help us and the other tour guide out.We were picked up on time by Matthew, bright and early. We first headed off to the remains of District 6. Along the way, he explained the history of the area. Our visit to the District 6 museum afterwards really brought our experience at the actual site there to life and gave us a clearer perspective.When we arrived in Langa, we had a brief tour of the visitor center. Once our guide Odwa arrived, we started a walking tour. Odwa would walk and explain certain areas to us. Then we would hop in the van and head off to different areas of Langa for more sights and information. Odwa was fantastic! We were not apprehensive about visiting a township, but Odwa made it so welcoming and safe. At the end of our day with African Blue, Matthew dropped us off at the Waterfront to catch our ferry to Robben Island. He gave us great directions where to board the ferry, and after he parked, he met us there to make certain we made it there okay. Matthew was not as engaging as some of our other tour guides, but he did a very good job and we saw everything we were promised. Odwa made our day very memorable too. All in all, a great morning of enlightenment!"

His obvious love for the area came across especially in his distress at the devastating forest fires that were raging at the time of our stay...our lunch at the two oceans restaurant was interrupted by a member of staff saying that we wouldn't be able to have dessert as the place was being evacuated due to the smoke nearby !! The whole day was full of highlights,spotting a whale from our boat in Houts Bay on the way to the seal colony,the penguins at Boulders,the delightful gardens at Kirstenbosch...all in all a great day."

Duncan was punctual, polite, courteous, attentive, always asked if we needed to use the bathroom and at each stops he always let us know where the bathrooms were. Duncan was very knowledgeable and he gave us the history and details of the places we were visiting and we had some very good conversations with Duncan. We felt very comfortable with Duncan. Duncan was an excellent tour guide and we could not have asked for more. We will definitely recommend African Blue Day Tours to anyone we know who is going to Capetown and have Duncan as their tour guide."

On the way back we asked if we could squeeze in a stop at Betty's Bay penguin colony. We preferred it to Boulders Beach- it was much more low-key, natural and cheaper!

I was the first pickup and got an amazing tour of Cape Town as we picked up the other passengers. There were 7 total. I was able to ride in the front seat since I was solo. Our first stop was the Anura Winery and we sampled wines with a selection of jams and cheeses. This was a great start to the day. From there we drove to Franschhoek and were given ~ 2 hours to shop and have lunch. This was too long for me. There was a wonderful Arts & Crafts faire with some vendors selling food. I had a good lunch and shared a picnic table with a local family. The next winery was Eikehof Winery where we tasted wines outside under ancient oak trees. The owner poured the wines! We then drove to the historic & university town of Stellenbosch where we had 40 minutes to explore and shop. Unfortunately it was Saturday afternoon and many of the stores had closed. We didn't make it to the 3rd winery before they closed (Vergenoegd) but we were able to walk the grounds. This was a lovely day, good weather and I had another private city tour since I was the last to be dropped off."

He gave us such and insight and you could tell how easily he was connecting with the people who invited us into their homes and kindergarten, He also gave us great demos of the click sounds in the Xhosa language. Ludumo came to our hotel in a timely fashion and we had a great morning. If there is one tour that one must book in Capetown, this is the one! Ludumo also had our Robben Island tickets for the afternoon and showed us where to get the boat. Robben Island was very interesting but if you have a weak stomach, avoid the boat.It is still very important to see if you can get there.The next day we did a half day tour of Stellenbosch and the wine country with none other than David himself and his lovely wife, Michelle, who went to the university in Stellenbosch.The town was quaint and Michelle filled us in on the university.We are not wine drinkers at all but it was worth it to see the beautiful vineyards and landscapes.

From the moment I first inquired about the excursion, David was great to work with. He was quick to respond to any of my questions which made me very comfortable about booking with him. The tour itself was eye-opening and inspiring. David and Matthew picked us up at our accommodation (they ran a few minutes late due to a traffic stop). David was a great guide and very informative as we drove to the township. He was able to give us insight into what it was like to grow up 'privileged' during the Apartheid era before we got to the township. David then left us in the very good and capable hands of Odwa, a resident of Langa. Odwa was a fantastic guide and gave us a great tour of the township. It's difficult to put into words all that was seen and experienced, so suffice it to say, i would highly recommend this tour.After the township tour ended, David picked us up and brought us to the waterfront to catch the ferry to Robben Island. There was a bit of a hassle getting onto the ferry, but there is nothing David could have done about it. We had tickets for the 1pm crossing, but due to overselling and the lateness of the returning ferry, the 1pm ferry was full so we didn't board the next ferry until almost 2. Something to keep in mind if you have time constraints.The Robben Island tour itself was remarkable. The bus ride around the island for an orientation was pleasant. The bus guide did a good job of explaining what life was like around the island. However, it wasn't until we got to the prison and met Derek that the visit came to life. Derek was a political prisoner on the island in the late 80s until his release when all political prisoners were let go. His first-hand account of the treatment and conditions really brought the tour alive.David did an outstanding job putting together this tour for us so i can highly recommend his company as one to book with."

On the 9th of September we had a tour through the Winelands with Matthew and it was fantastic.We went to see and tast different wine producing places and to see the most beautiful landscapes. This tour was amazing, not only because of the wonderful landscape and wine, but because Matthew was there arranging everything for us. He was a very thoughtful tour guide, making us feel very confortable and relaxed. He also arranged a reservation for us on the restaurante \"La Roca\", with the most beautiful view and tasteful food!We had an amazing time this day with Matthew and we didn\u00b4t feel we were with a stranger but with a friend! Thank you for everything Matthew and we hope to see you soon!"

Having grown up in Cape Town he knows all the history personally, and I always felt he was excited to share that knowledge with us, as opposed to some guides who seem to just read off a script. It all seemed to move effortlessly and next thing you know we were off to the next great spot. And when his wife (who provides surfing instruction/lessons) was unavailable, he even took a group of us out and taught us himself. At the end we all felt we had met a great guide and a friend. He was fantastic and I can't recommend him enough. I really mean it, stop searching and just book with him. You won't go wrong."

We had arrived by cruise ship and were late docking so, with military precision and a casual, yet efficient manner, he made sure we got there in time.He guided us around Cape Town and Table Mountain. I like his style. He gives you enough information and enough time to yourself. Some guides just keep talking and nothing sinks in. He has a healthy balance.A few days later, he collected us in Franschhoek and guided us for 5 days to various destinations and attractions on the \"Garden Route\".Throughout this time, David had to deal with varying numbers of Aussies as some joined different parts of the activities. In total, there were 14 people.All-in-all, a big \"thank you\". We thoroughly enjoyed every moment."

            "review": "Great time on the Garden Route. First, my disclaimer- while I booked my tour through African Blue, my tour ended up being operated by Tompson's Africa. The tour, however, was great, and David (of African Blue) was very helpful. So this review is mostly a review of David and African Blue.We were on our honeymoon and while we were on our own on safari and in Cape Town, we were looking for a Garden route group tour for a few days in the middle of our trip. We booked a great 4 day tour with David, who also helped to arrange our hotel in Cape Town. As i mentioned our tour was great, but David had it provided by a different operator. When we arrived in Cape Town after the tour, there was a problem with the room that the hotel wouldnt fix, so as a last resort, we called David to help us sort it out. He actually came over at 9pm and convinced the hotel to give us a new room for the night, and to fix the problem the next day. What a great advocate!We also booked a private wine tour with David, but my wife was sick that morning so we ended up on a tour of a doctor's office instead. David helped us sort things out, and we booked a second day with him so we could ultimately do our wine tour as planned.In sum, we can't really comment on the quality of the garden route tour, because ours ended up operated by another company. But it was a fantastic tour nonetheless! I can comment on how great David was with the booking process, and how great an advocate he was when we were in South Africa."

Thanks to David, who not only organized the trip to Aquila Reserve on a short term but also helped us finding a great appartment in Camps Bay, we really had a great time at the Reserve. We booked the self-drive Safari and as David promised it was really easy to find. Rooms where nice, our family cottage was quite big and we had enough time to relax and ejoy the view over the Karoo from the terrace. On our two game drives we saw all the Big 5 and our guide was very informative and funny as well. Unless Aquila is nothing like Krueger Park it is really an outdoor safari experience rather than a visit at the Zoo."

We had already booked a private 4 day and 3 night Cape Agulhas & Garden Route Tour with our guide David Smith (African Blue Tours Owner) so it was an obvious choice for us to book this one day tour. We were joined by 3 lovely ladies from South America and a cool guy from Italy. The one day Cape Peninsula Tour is must for any visitor to Cape Town and you will find it difficult to beat African Blue Tours. David is a fantastic tour guide, who has lived in Camps Bay all his life, his knowledge and passion for Cape Town is truly infectious. Cape Town and the Peninsula is definitely the most beautiful and most breathtaking places on earth and my wife and I will definitely be coming back."

It was a last minute trip and I was trying to book a tour to Kruger the following morning upon my arrival. I didn't think it wouldve been possible, but African Blue made it happen. I shot David an email right before boarding the plane with details of where I was staying along with the reservation form, and also informed him of the possibility I would have no email access for the next 21 hours. I arrived @ my hotel in JNB about 11pm with messages that everything was taken care of, and a scheduled pick up the following morning was also confirmed. It was a great tour!!!I woke up my first night on the reserve to let some light in. It was amazing to open the curtains and find giraffes and zebras passing my window a few feet away. One of the best things to see!!! (pics attached)"

I was given the task to research and plan a trip through the Stellenbosch wine country: a task that took hours across multiple days cross referencing sites and whittling out the paid tourism posts on the internet. Skip ALL OF THIS, and hire David.David guided my group of 10 through wine country on a 3-stop day trip and it was the most comprehensive day on our South African holiday. I highly recommend hiring a small, local company like African Blue Tours because you get an authentic local's perspective of the area. Aside from showing up on time, providing great, comfortable transportation, the conversations we had with him gave amazing insight into the politics, culture, and geography of South Africa. Had I known better, I would have skipped all the research, worry, and planning and just had David take us to his favorite spots. I highly recommend letting him take the reigns when planning your wine country trip and let yourself sit back and enjoy your trip!

I was torn between a wine tour and a cape tour as I had limited time, but this was a perfect way to combine the two. All bases were covered throughout the trip, with an amazing vibe thanks to our guide Ziggy! Not only due to her extensive knowledge on the area, but also her vast local connections and interest in the passengers' experiences and knowledge. I don't think anyone could not have a good time with guides showing this much passion and enthusiasm for what they do.Amazing scenery and experiences, with the flexibility to cater to groups of different age dynamics. Great South African food also prepared for us by our guide, as well as sampling some of the local delights.Thanks again to Ziggy and Lucky and Lost Tours, couldn't have asked for a better day on the Cape!"

My group was pretty small, but I can imagine Ziggy would make it very easy for solo travelers to have a great time with everyone else on the tour. Other tours have you do a small amount of cycling at the Cape, but Ziggy -- very thoughtfully -- skips this to allow you to take one of the most beautiful hour-long walks I've ever experienced from the lighthouse to another gorgeous viewpoint -- absolutely spectacular! Of course, I enjoyed the stunning scenery, the delicious (and healthy) lunch, and the winery stop, but it was also a pleasure just to spend the afternoon with Ziggy and talk to her about South Africa and her travels around the world. Our day together was one of the highlights of my time in Cape Town and, really, all of South Africa."

Good value for money. 5 wineries with generous tastings, ample lunch in a lovely setting and plenty of pairing bites of cheese and chocolate along the way. Very professional. Made booking via email at the last minute and they were very prompt in their response. Highly recommended."

I cannot recommend Wine Flies enough, they do exactly what they promise, they were punctual on all of their pick ups and delivered a fantastic day out around the Stellenbosch area. I also had the embarrassment of being so tipsy that I left my phone on the bus, and the driver returned to our hotel after his last drop off to return it to me, I was very impressed. Our driver for the day was BIG G, he was knowledgeable, enthusiastic and very impressive. He took us for an unscheduled drive around Stellenbosch pointing out places of interest and we could not have had a better guide. Wine flies takes you to 5 vineyards which is one more than most tour companies, and I really cannot praise them enough. The food , the wine and the whole day with a bunch of happy mixed nationality guests was just fantastic."

I could not suggest a better wine tour.At the start of Oct, my wife and I joined a range of international tourists on our Wine Flies tour around the Stellenbosch area.  Our guide Terrence was amazing from the start, with his passion for what he does, showing up in how he explained everything, from his knowledge of Cape Town to the production of wine in our country. He treated us to a history of how wine first started in SA, and explained how wine grows from the seed to ending up in the wine glass.Each of the 5 local farms we visited had their own sense of uniqueness, and atmosphere; and the wines we tasted at each, were incredible, with special mention to the chocolate pairing in the LovanE cellar.Having the experience of tasting wine direct from its barrel through to tasting an 8 year old Port at the end of the day. This is definitely a tour I will not soon forget and I look forward to joining them again on the other tours they offer.Thanks to Wine flies and to Terrence for an awesome day out in the wine lands."

Very friendly, knowledgeable and professional, and kept the day ticking along nicely. He was always at hand to explain any extra questions we had. The tour was exceptional value for money (heaps of wine pairing with cheeses, chocolates, meats, and also lunch all included). I just wish I could buy some of that biltong and droewors in bulk from you guys! (PM me if you wish to share the supplier name ;) )A couple of suggestions for Wine Flies: 1. Maybe consider a single meeting point for the group in the morning, so as to maximise touring time and minimise the 'dead' time of driving in peak hour traffic picking up everyone from different areas, and,2. A brief stop-off in Stellenbosch town would have been awesome. The building architecture and scenery in the town is a real highlight Cape Town highlight, so perhaps that additional time saved via implementation of Point 1 above could turn into a half-hour wander in Stellenbosch's main street?"

We we picked up first by our tour host on time and collected the rest of the group before heading to the first vine yard. There was no pressure from the tour guide to take part in the activities or the tasting which made for a nice relaxing atmosphere and helped the group to socialise with each other. There was an excellent balance to the day with information on the production of wine in the region as well as tastings and lunch. I will definitely do the tour again when I return to Cape Town!"

My GF & I booked 3-days of private tours with Wine Flies covering (1) Paarl/Wellington/Swartland (2) Walkerbay/Hermanus and (3) Stellenbosch/Franshoeck areas. In the months and then weeks proceeding our arrival, the fine tuning of wine \"estates\" (not wineries) were narrowed down based upon our personal preferences. We requested smaller, more personal tasting locations vs large commercial properties, which the WF were able to arrange. We stopped for lunch each day in each region at 1:00/13:00. Lunches are not a covered expense and as such we selected where we wanted to go based upon a list of recommendations from WF. Our morning pace was a bit heavier than after lunch which made for a great balance. Our guide for all 3-days was \"V\" who provided insight into not only the wine regions but was able to field questions about the history of Cape Town as well. V was a pleasure to travel with over the three days and took great care to provide just the right amount of attention and handling without being a bother. Whether you have extensive wine experience or very little, the Wine Flies is an excellent company for tasting while in the Cape Town region."

However after the first estate the tastings did feel slightly rushed and so I would be tempted to say just four estates would be better to allow for a bit more time. That said, I wouldn't want to miss any of the five!All in all it was a great day and would do it again in a heartbeat. Thanks"

We landed in Cape Town on Sunday night at 9 PM and it was 11 PM before we were \"lights out\" at our hotel. We were asked to be ready for pick up on Monday morning at 8:30 for pick up between 8:30-9:00. We were picked up during that window in a clean shuttle bus with functioning air conditioning, including in the back row. The group was approximately 12 adults including couples, co-workers, singles, and siblings, and our guide Terrance. We were the only two people from the United States which was great; other countries represented were Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia (we got some great advice for a future trip to Australia :). This was a fun and informative tour. I ended up sitting up front with Terrance after the first stop since I can get motion sick easily. That was awesome as it gave me a chance to talk to him about a lot of other things about South Africa, not just the wine. He was a wealth of information about the wine region and each winery. The first stop was the only one that included an MCC, the South African \"champagne\". That was a bummer for me since I loved it, but that was not a surprise and the other wines didn't disappoint. With the first wine, you get a little biltong (if you don't know, it is a dried, cured meat similar to beef jerky). At the second stop, we paired cheeses with wine. When the wine tasting was done, there was an opportunity for people to purchase a beer flight of locally made beers. My husband did it and was far more impressed with the wine than the beer, but it was still fun and worth a taste. The third stop was wine and lunch. Both of the first two stops included decent sized tasting portions of five wines so the lunch and water break was well timed (and with wine, of course). Your fourth stop will be to a great place with my dream basement bar. There you will pair local chocolates with wines. The \"berries only\" Cabernet was outstanding. We left with one bottle, but I wish we had purchased more and chanced it in our luggage since shipping to the U.S. is outrageously expensive. Lastly, you stop at a small, very rustic family winery where we were served another five really great wines. We ended with being dropped off at the front door of our hotel with enough time for a rest before our evening dinner plans. This was really a perfect tour for the first day since we were tired and didn't want something strenuous that first day, but couldn't afford to take a day off to just sit around and rest. We learned a lot, enjoyed the company, and our guide was fantastic. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Wine Flies to anyone looking for an excellent, hassle free, wine tour of the Cape region!"

I learned a lot about the process of wine making as well as various types of wine specific to South Africa. We had a full van of about 13 people - each is picked up at your hotel. The group never seemed unwieldy, though as people bought more wine the van did get a little cramped!We chose this tour b/c it visited smaller 'off the beaten path' wineries as well as served lunch at one cheese and wine at one and chocolate and wine at one - so even my friend who doesn't like wine as much enjoyed the chocolate! A couple of the wineries had their tastings out on picnic tables with the mountains and vineyards surrounding which was especially nice. Definitely enjoyed this day and would recommend!"

Our driver and tour guide Wouter picked us up in the early morning with an old-school Land rover. After picking up the rest of tour participants, we went to the Stellenbosch winelands to visit five consecutive wine farms. This included a cheese & wine tasting, biltong & wine tasting and a chocolate & wine tasting. A lovely farm lunch was also included. Each farm offered a unique experience, even the ones that we had visited before. Our tour guide Wouter was very knowledgeable, friendly and witty. Wine flies tours offers an amazing one-day experience for everyone, especially for people that stay for only a little while in Cape Town and don\u2019t have time to explore the winelands themselves."

We visited Annandale, Lovane (with chocolate pairings), Middelvlei (with a fab braai lunch), Remhoogte (not Fairview) and finished with Villiera. Ian was warm, informative and very engaging.

Got picked up on time and entered the van to see each chair topped with a variety of hats, each very stylish and welcoming :) Had a tour of five wineries and had a ball. Many had dogs who joined us for some tastings. Lunch was a braii and tasty. Highly recommended."

The tour was really well organised visiting 5 vineyards in and around Stellenbosch, a cellar tour, cheese and chocolate food pairings with some of wine and a braaii lunch included - great value given most other tours we looked at did not include cost of lunch and were more expensive. A really good mix of vineyards too from larger estates to small boutique farms - would definitely recommend this tour to anyone visiting Cape Town - they pick you up/drop you off directly at your accommodation as well."

Our guide Laurence was extremely knowledgeable and tolerated our wine filled national anthem singing shenanigans quite well. On the ride to Stellenbosch he filled us with historical knowledge of the area, at the vineyards he took us through the wine making process, and on the way back he dropped us off at a bar so we could continue our festivities. Can't recommend this tour enough!"

This tour was so much more thanks to our guide Ian. Ian explained how the grapes were grown and processed and how the wines were bottled. There were also wine pairings with cheese and chocolates. At one winery we ate lunch. Of course we had opportunities to purchase wine at each location.Our winery tour day started off early at about 10 AM with a quiet busload of 13 tourists. However, after the first winery were much friendlier. After the fifth winery, we were old friends.I'd highly recommend wine flies wine tours. Just hope you get Ian for your guide."

At the first vineyard we went thru vineyard and learned about all the steps involved in making the wine. Our guide knew so much. We were even able to see some bottling. Then we started the tasting and learned the five Ss of wine tasting. Then the great South African wine favors began to flow. We had stops with cheese pairings and chocolate pairings a great lunch and of course more wine. It was a great day and value. Several of the vineyards even had animals running around so you could check out some zebras with your Chenin blanc or warthog with your Pinotage. It was the perfect balance of wine and info. I would defiantly recommend it and I would do it again for sure."

Minibus was comfortable and our driver and guide for the day Terance made everyone feel welcome.During the day we visited 5 farms, with a combination of different styles/sizes (our particular favourite was the smallest estate we visited)Each farm had a different pairing (one with cheese, one with chocolate, one with biltong) which added variety as did different talks from our guide (one explaining the vines and growing process, one in the production cellars etc)We had a group with average age of late 20s and the tour felt aimed at those who are not experts both of which were perfect for us but may not be suitable for more knowledgable wine drinkers who may be better off doing a private tour (Wine Flies do such tours as do multiple other companies in the area)Thanks Wine Flies for a brilliant day out and special mention to Terance!"

You could really tell that he enjoys the region, and the tour, and he even pulled together a great play list for our day.

Having done many Stellenbosch wine farms in my day, I didn't think this tour would be any different. Boy, was I wrong!Not only was it a thoroughly enjoyable day, but the farms we visited were fantastic, and there was a little surprise at the last farm (I'll stop there and leave it as a surprise for you too). Our guide, Ian, was another level of good! He has a vast knowledge of wine and the area, cool taste in music, and is a friendly, fun, down-to-earth guy! The best!I'm not sure if it was planned this way, but everyone on the bus with us was within about 10 years of each other, so it was a \"young\" group and it was easy to chat and enjoy ourselves as a group. The lunch (braai) wasn't that amazing (I felt there are nicer menus available - e.g I think a potjie would have been cooler) but it was still tasty, and added to the South African experience. All in all, a wonderful experience, and good value! I would not hesitate to recommend WineFlies to anyone looking for an organised tour. Well done, guys. And thank you!"

If you are interested in the earlier days of South Africa's history which are normaly barely mentioned in all travel guides this is the tour to do! Just don't want to go too much into detail to not spoil all the small surprises along the way. But one thing I can promise: if you are going on the trip to Matjiesfontein, you do not receive a long-winded history lesson but an interesting and fun inside to some of South Africa's secrets... and of course you get some wine as well :-) Thanks again for two great days guys and keep on going!!!

During the tastings we had some excellent presentations from the vineyards. We enjoyed the smaller estates, where there are some great wines. A really good day with this great little company. Would fully recommend this for a good day out."

Three of the four vineyards visited were lovely - just one disappointment which Ian acknowledged during our tour. Lunch was delicious and the bus trip was a giggle with an 80's music singalong that added to the atmosphere! A great end to my week in Cape Town. Just trying to organise getting my camera back - left on the bus after one too many wines tasted! Thanks Ian."

Having done a similar tour last year, I was keen to try another group for a different selection of wine farms. Apart from Fairview, where every tour goes, the other wine farms were all unique and interesting. Coming from Australia, the wines were so cheap. The hard part was limiting it to the 3 I can take home. Informative host and a good group for the day. I liked the fact that the bus seating was mixed up at each stop. Made it easier to meet everyone on the tour."

I thought we were paying for a more immersive experience. However, our time at the wineries was no different than the people the arrived on the tram. Our guide was fine, but not great. At times he seemed like a bit of a third wheel on what was supposed to be a romantic day. Not trying to be too hard on the guy, I think he did the job he's asked to do, but it was a reality of the tour. There was quite a bit of driving involved in this particular tour. Which I suppose more savvy travelers than myself would have expected to spend nearly half the day in a car. My final verdict is -- The extra 3000 Rand we spent to go on this tour was not money well spent. There wasn't much value added."

We visited a strange and inconsistent grab bag of wine farms, missing some of the real gems in the region. Imagine a full day without visiting Franschhoek (stopping at the historic prison wher Nelson Mandela was released) and seeing Stellenbosch from the window of the van. Imagine also a braai with a pitiful plate of food. By the last winery I wanted to ask to go home. This is an extraordinary wine region. On my previous wine tour, our party visited 3 carefully chosen wine farms over the course of a full day (with an exquisite lunch at one of them) and time to shop Stellenbosch. If you are going on a wine tour, do your homework. Ask about the wineries you'll go to, then look them up. Ask if the tour will be augmented by visits to what makes the region special besides its wine farms. Time is to precious to waste."

We were gently educated though the wines with humour. Lunch was a lovely BBQ/salad also paired with wine, set under parasols on the lawn of a lovely colonial manor house. Our tour continued on late into the afternoon with more pairings. If you don't like wine, now's the time to start or you can have the soft option. At the end of the day we were light-heartedly quizzed on our knowledge absorbed during the day - the winning team winning a bottle of wine - so pay attention! All good fun. A great day out.

We didn't book the personal tour, and were squeezed into a 12-passenger bus with 12 people, all of whom were lovely, but the bus was very cramped, and if you are someone who gets carsick or claustrophobic, you may opt for the personal tour as the vehicle was really tight on space and the roads curvy."

My favorite part was that we learned just enough to make it really still enjoyable and not overbearing on the facts.I do not drink red wine, I've tried it a handful of times and never enjoyed it. By the afternoon, I was drinking all of the red wine tastings which was pretty cool for me and I will continue to try tasting!Favorite vineyard was the one which we paired wines and chocolates - I literally wanted to dump the chocolates in my purse and have them forever. Unfortunately, the chocolate place is closed on Sundays which was the only day we had free we would have been able to get some. I plan on seeing if I can order some online...that's literally how delicious it was. Please do make sure to tip the tour guide - we found most people in our tour were leaving around R100 per person but that's because we found that she was really phenomenal and deserved it. We also had the pleasure of meeting the guy who started the company which was great he was really down the earth and chill explaining how the business got started and such.

Our guide was witty, very informative about the wines sampled, and an excellent driver. We visited five wineries, each very different, and all with a special bonus such as cheese or chocolate tastings. One winery served a home-style African barbecue lunch (braai) which was unique and could never be duplicated in a traditional restaurant. The wines were better quality than we expected and the day was simply fun, fun, fun. We can hardly believe that they charge so little and deliver so much.

Not only is this trip great from the second they pick you up (which they do, at your place, regardless of where you're staying in Cape Town), as the driver is engaging, informed and helpful, but the tour itself takes you to many different places and through many different tasting menus.There is wine not quite old enough to be bottled sampled directly from the barrels (awesome!), a tour of a cellar, a cheese and wine tasting, a CHOCOLATE and wine tasting, a lunch with wine AND a tasting at a farm that only bottles a few hundred bottles a year (small and local--a unique experience).I am from the SF bay area and have been on COUNTLESS wine tours in Napa, Sonoma, Livermore, Santa Cruz and Sacramento, and this was by far the best.Here is the icing on the cake. I was the first person they picked up, and I live WAY up on a hill in a remote part of Cape Town. As we drove around to pick up other guests, I started getting motion sick. I realized that I hadn't taken my pills with me (TOTALLY my mistake!), but the driver phoned one of the staff members, she came of her own accord, picked me up at a central meeting place, TOOK ME BACK TO MY HOUSE so I could get my pills and then drove me 20miles outside of town to meet up again with the bus.I have NEVER had service like this in the US and probably never will again.If I could give them 10 stars, I would!THANKS WINE FLIES!!<3"

After doing some research we decided to go with the Wine Flies Wine Tour and we are so glad we did because it ended up being one of the most fun days of our trip! Our \"Wine Lord\", Ian, was superb. Our group of 13 was fairly young (between 19-35) and no one was that knowledgeable when it came to wine and wine tasting so Ian really took his time in explaining such things as the history of South African wine, the way wine is produced, and the proper way to taste. His tour was very informative but he kept it entertaining throughout so I never felt even the slightest hint of boredom. There was even a fun pop-quiz at the end where the winning team was given a special prize (which I won't spoil!). The tour itself was also well structured. Pickup from our hotel was early (around 8:30a) and we reached our first vineyard in about an hour. You will begin tasting around 10am and continue tasting throughout 6 vineyards spread across the stunningly beautiful Stellenbosch with a delicious lunch served at the 3rd or 4th stop as well as cheese and chocolate tastings mixed in. By the end of the tour you will have had a fair amount of wine so you'll likely have a good buzz going and that just adds to the fun!"

I was a little apprehensive before going on the wine tour as I am quite picky with wine (I only drink dry reds) and wasn't sure if the wineries would hold up to my expectations. Other than the first winery I would say all the others were great! It is a lot of wine so bring water and make sure you eat breakfast! Lots of fun!"

We were picked up at our hotel at the scheduled time. Took about an hour to get from Cape Town to the first winery.In all we went to 5 wineries - each one was different and interesting. At one we got to drink wine out of the barrel - even got to raise it ourselves. One winery also did cheese so we got a nice tasting of different wines and cheeses, We ate a really nice included lunch at another winery. Our guide for the day was terrific - very knowledgeable and pleasant to be with - he obviously enjoys what he is doing. The cost for the tour was ridiculously inexpensive - great value."

I was a bit apprehensive at first as I was doing it on my own. However, our guide Ian was fantastic. He made it a fun experience (we won the quiz and he handed out hats) and the other people on the tour were just as amazing. Ian was extremely knowledgeable and clearly loved his job (who wouldn't love drinking wine and getting paid for it?!). Also, Ian's music collection is one to behold... he has something for everyone! By the end of our tour we were all singing alongThe vineyards we went to were great - everyone will always have their favourites as it all depends on taste. Fairview and the matched cheese tasting was my particular favourite. All in all, I'd highly recommend Wine Flies especially in terms of value for money. In fact, next time I am in Cape Town I plan to take another tour with them and visit some of the other vineyards/tours they offer."

The lunch was great and our guide, Ian, was very knowledgeable. There was an issue of the dropoff - one of the guests was staying in Table View (30 mins away from Cape Town) and we had to stay in the car for more than 1.5 hours picking up and dropping that person off. I would suggest that you dropoff passengers in the order they were picked up so that the amount of time spent in the vehicle is the same for everyone.We also weren't told that our second winery was the last one where we can buy white wine so some of the white wine lovers didn't purchase enough wine.Overall the experience was good, but the hour that we spent in traffic at the end of the day didn't end the day on a good note."

It was poorly serviced and I could heard hear clangy noises coming from the gearbox or diff... not good if you take into account we have to travel in that vehicle for 8 to 10 hours! Got picked up at 7am was dropped off at 7pm.. - The driver (Wouter) needs to consider the fact that he has the lives of 13 people in his hands, he speeds and there were many times I could see hes was not in control of the vehicle when driving over 120kph or when the wind blows accross the road..- Lasty not everybody likes the music he prefers. It is unfortunate that he thinks everyone must listen to it loudly even after some wine; again 8+ hours exposure to it... I suggest he uses headphones, as I was not the only one that mentioned this It is unfortunate to say but in general on all the drive tours the drivers are very blase and irresponsible with their passenger's lives."

We also were given tours of the wine making processes at different wineries from picking and juicing, to primary fermention and storing and finally bottling. Each of the winery stops included tastings of 5-6 wines (generous pours, so be prepared to drink) with one providing a cheese pairing (my favorite stop), one lunch (ok - not gourmet by any means and served family style; my favorite was the squash bisque) and another providing chocolate pairings with wine. Of course there is the opportunity to purchase wine to take away with you and our group was not shy with the shared \"road soda\" between stops, Big G buying our first round. While the tours may seem a bit pricey, it is well worthy the cost to have a driver to help enjoy the wine tasting worry free and have someone walk you through the wine growing and making process.\u00a0"

We visited five different wineries....one winery paired the five wines with five different kinds of chocolate; another winery paired the wines with different varieties of biltong(S,A,'s version of jerky make from beef, elk, etc.) and Droeewors(dried sausage); another winery served a great wine with a beautiful lunch served on the grounds followed by a cellar tour and tasting; one of the five wineries served the wines in a formal dining room and paired the five wines with eight different cheeses; and the final winery served wines no longer available anywhere. I was able to sample some Chalbert- a lovely Merlot bottled for the wedding of Prince Albert and Charlene(from Monoco).All is all it was a fabulous day....I was treated like royalty at every stop....I think due to the fact that I was travelling with Riaan, who was a wealth of interesting and entertaining information. To cap off the adventure, I was privileged to try one of their own wines \"Little Dry Red\", which I thoroughly enjoyed! I couldn\u2019t imagine a better experience.

We will always remember (bits and pieces) of this tour! ;) it is THE perfect activity to do while the weather isn't cooperating for table mountain."

Lord V, our tour guide was brilliant he kept us all entertained by playing musical chairs in the bus on the way to the different vine yards he was always pleasant and open to questions.In Stellenbosch we were taught how to tell whats in the wine by it's smell. How the wine was made and obviously got to taste all the different types of wines. From Stellenbosch we traveled to Grabouw and went to taste all the different wors and biltong and got a little history lesson from the butcher himself which was very interesting.We then got to go to Everson wine and cider farm where I tasted the best cider of my life ( I will never have Savanna again after tasting Everson ) while we learnt about the Everson farm from Mr Everson himself Lord V was making a BBQ for us with some of the wors he bought while we were at the butcher.After Everson we had lunch at a restaurant high in the mountains called Ell, which was a hidden germ, being vegetarian I had the vegetable curry which was so delicious, we got to taste more wine at the restaurant which was paired with some chocolate, so yummy :)We also went to Hermanus to spot some whales, it was so beautiful to see, after whale watching we had even more wine at another farm. All in all, a fabulous day with spectacular views and a brilliant tour guide great food and wine. Thank you Wine Flies. I definitively recommend this tour to anyone and everyone! <3"

Myself and my husband have been on many wine tours including Napa and this was by far the best. The wine was delicious and had a ton of variety. Big G was very knowledgeable and provided a lot of information on the wineries and the process of making the wine. We went to 4 different wineries. One they served us a yummy lunch with sausage, chicken and cypress grilled cheese. The wine tour in total was about 10 hours but so worth it to experience these different places."

Booking and communications was easy and Lord G was a fantastic guide to the five wine farms we visited. He was very knowledgeable, personable, and enthusiastic. We never felt rushed and the day just flew by we were having so much fun. It was the perfect mix of good wine, information, and beautiful scenery. The stops were each unique and interesting.

We knew we wanted to visit some wineries outside of Cape Town but didn't really want to worry about renting a car, so we were so happy when a friend of ours recommended Wine Flies. The tour was great - Clinton, our guide, was an aspiring winemaker himself, so he gave us a lot of insight into the entire process, and knew the owners of the wineries very well, so we often got some extra perks along the way. As other reviewers have mentioned, Clinton did a great job of spacing out the tour, and making sure we were eating here and there, so even though you were trying alot of wines (most wineries offered tastings of 5-6 wines at least), you didn't feel like you were overly drunk at the end of the day. I would definitely recommend this tour for anyone who wants to check out the winelands, but doesn't necessarily have alot of time, or does not want to rent a car and drive around themselves."

I learned a lot about the historical role of viticulture in South Africa, techniques for doing a proper wine taste, wine, port, and brandy production, fun facts about the families that run each vineyard, etc. Everything was perfectly managed from beginning to end and the vineyards selected gave a wonderful range of styles, tastes, landscapes, and history for us to soak in."

I was looking forward to a nice wine tour of Stellenbosch and I got it, however I was pretty surprised that the tour descended into a massive sloppy wine crawl, as that's not the impression I got from the website and other TA reviews.I'm pretty sure this is because we had a group of eight uni students on school break, and all they wanted to do was drink, drink, drink. They bought wine from the wineries and kept passing around open bottles in the van for everyone to share (very kind of them, I won't lie). I didn't drink any because I had plans that evening that I couldn't show up very drunk for, but I also wasn't prepared for a big booze fest.I had fun, for sure, but I think if I were any older than 30 I wouldn't have enjoyed myself much on the loud, drunk party bus. I think it would be different if it were a more mixed group or one that wasn't full of students, but I'm not sure.Our guide, Granwell, was great, the wineries were very nice, and the lunch was delicious."

Would highly recommend it for anyone looking to explore Stellenbosch through its wines!"

They've got everything down to a perfect science, including the timing of the tastings so you're happily buzzed without being wasted or even forgetting the cool stuff you're learning about wine and wine making. Lord V was our tour guide and he was an excellent mix of fun, laid-back, professional, educational, silly, and responsible. I would imagine that Wine Flies has other quality guides, but I would definitely suggest requesting Lord V - he was the man! If you're thinking of going wine tasting and want to do something fun that doesn't require much thought or effort on your part, I cannot recommend Wine Flies enough."

He customized our itinerary to fit our needs and offered us a vast amount of information on not only wines, but history, nature and any other question we threw his way. He's very knowledgable and the exact sort of person you want showing you around the beautiful wine region. No complaints! Great day, great memories! Thanks!"

I'm a vegetarian and was accommodated with a wonderful substitution. Pickup and drop off from your accommodation is an added bonus as most tours charge extra or require you to get yourself up to Stellenbosch."

I am a quadriplegic from a gymnastics injury sustained at Michigan State University in April 1991 who is interested in global travel and participating in activities not normally associated with disabled people. I\u2019m currently on an adventure that will explore worldwide handicapped accessibility. Many people have travel blogs, but there are none that I know of that come from the vantage point of a wheelchair user going off the accessible path.I get picked up at my hotel by Granwell from Wine Flies Wine Tours. We are on a Toyota mini bus that I transfer to the floor then to the seat closest to the door. There are 13 people on the tour today. Our first stop is in Paarl wine region at Fairview Wine & Cheese about 45 minutes away. The parking lot and walkway at the winery is gravel, with a slight up hill. Granwell helps push me to the entrance. Once to the entrance it is paved and easy to wheel around. Brian is the presenter for the wine. The tasting is a pairing of 5 wines, 5 cheeses and one sweet dessert wine.We have a 15 minute drive to the Stellenbosch wine region for the rest of our wine tasting tour. Villiera Winery is our first winery in Stellenbosch. Granwell gives us a tour of the wine making process from vine to bottling. He also is our wine presenter. We taste 7 wines at Villiera. The tour and tasting room are all accessible.Lunch is at Middelvlei Wine Estate 15 minutes down the road. The lunch area is accessible but I get help from Granwell up the hill to the cellar. I could have done by myself but it was much quicker with his help. In the cellar we taste a 2013 Merlot straight from the aging barrel and a great group photo opportunity with the wine barrels in the background.The next tasting is at Lovane Boutique Wine Estate about 10 minutes away. There are 3 steps I need carried up to the entrance. The tasting room is in the basement. Two workers help me down a very steep ramp with wood rungs. This is the ramp they use to roll the wine barrels up and down to the cellar. Lovane only produces red wine, about 2000-3000 bottles per year. Our tasting was Cabernet Sauvignon from 4 different years and a sweet red wine. I am helped back up the ramp by Granwell pushing the back of my chair and the two workers from before pulling from the front. I\u2019m helped down the 3 steps then we\u2019re off to our last tasting today, Annandale Estates Winery about 15 minutes away.We head to the tasting area that\u2019s accessible, our presenter is Pierre. We taste 4 different wines and a brandy. Pierre was the best wine presenter of the day. We have a 45 minute ride back to Cape Town during which me and a few people on the tour make plans to continue the drinking. This was the best wine tour I\u2019ve been on since I started traveling in January 2014. This is the first tour I\u2019ve went out with people after the tour. Granwell did a great job as our driver and tour guide. I would recommend this wine tour to anyone who visits Cape Town. This tour is possible for an active manual wheelchair user who is able to transfer from their chair the floor of the bus then to a seat. Most places were accessible, but Granwell and people on the tour were more than happy to help when needed. Paving the parking lot and walkway at Fairview Wine & Cheese would make this stop accessible. Building a ramp at Lovane would make it easier to get to the entrance but there is no way to make getting to the tasting room accessible without the installation of an elevator. It would not be economical with very few wheelchair users doing the tour.Photos of Wine Flies Tour can be viewed at http://offtheaccessiblepath.smugmug.com/Africa/South-Africa/Wine-Flies-Tour/Wine-Flies-Tour/Accessibility wise this tour would receive a 3/5 rating."

However, it's worth it. The wineries are beautiful and have great wine, and the cheese and chocolate and lunch are excellent complements. The penultimate winery on the tour, Lovane, has the best wine. Annandale, the last winery on the tour, should be excluded from the package based on the bigoted comments of its drunken proprietor. Otherwise, the tour was perfect."

We were picked up at our waterfront Capte Town hotel in the morning and spent a wonderful day touring 5 different wineries. We had a beautiful lunch with some puppy Mastiffs as company and sampled a lot of wine. You will not go thirsty or hungry on this tour.The day's soundtrack warrants a shoutout - our driver had an incredible mix of sing-a-long classics such as Meatloaf's \"I'll Do Anything for Love\", Celine Dion's \"All Coming Back to Me\", Ace of Base's \"The Sign\", Aqua's \"Barbie Girl\", and many other songs that you know every single word to whether you admit it or not. Our driver was WONDERFUL...but his name is escaping me...Grantham? He looked like he might've been Samoan and was tall and broad and rocked a black tophat w/ khaki shorts. He divided our van into two groups and administered a written exam after our creative thoughts were well lubricated - good fun. ProTip: Do not overindulge the night before...you would be underestimating how much you are going to drink on this tour and might not make it through the day. We had a girl on our trip who only slept 2 hours the night before sleep through two wineries. Don't be that person.Bottom Line: Great Price, Good Fun, Highly Recommend."

From the moment we were met in Cape Town to being dropped off on the 2nd day. Our guides Riaan and Clinton kept us informed with endless stories and facts about South Africa of many years ago. Their knowledge was endless . Every aspect of the trip was well organised and faultless.One of the many highlights for us was the stop at the local biltong factory where we had the most delicious and traditional lunch of beef shin and Karoo lamb stews. Then the most delicious puddings all for the cost of 100 Rand per head.For the price we paid for this trip we found to be excellent value for money. It was one of the many memorable things we have done on our holiday .Thank you so much Riaan and ClintonKind regardsMalcolm and Ann Green"

I've lived in Cape Town and have done wine tastings many times all over the cape winelands and this tour was one of the best experiences I have had! Not having to worry about driving, especially after 5 vineyards with 5 very full wine tastings (this wouldn't be possible in your own car as the driver), was absolutely fantastic! I have only ever been to one of the wineries previously, otherwise the rest were new for me and the wine of course was great! A hearty and delicious lunch was also provided at a small family winery which was a wonderful experience. It was amazing how much our guide was able to fit into a single day and we were all having a jolly time by the time we returned to the city. Also, as a single traveller it was very easy to meet everyone else on the tour and I quickly became friends with the other guests (wine can be a social lubricant lol). Our guide was also very knowledgeable about wine and wine making so if you're a connoisseur I'm sure you can ask any questions you may have in mind and he would be able to answer. Overall it was an awesome day with lots of delicious South African wine and I will definitely recommend this tour!Thank you Wine Flies!"

And there's no more pleasant way to discover the good wine places and spend an entertaining and informative time than by booking a tour with Wine Flies. These guys have something more than knowledge for wine: I believe it's called passion. I did a classical one day tour with them and enjoyed every minute. But the tour that fascinated me the most was the two-day tour they call the Forgotten Route. It's a jewel of a journey, combining travel with the Shosholoza Meyl train, Karoo desert, yummy wine, braai, fun, breathtaking landscape and most certainly plenty of information about the region from one of your dedicated Wine Flies guide. That leaves me with one more tour to go with them, for which I'll then have to come back to South Africa. Look no more, the Forgotten Route is one you will remember!"

Your guide will drop you off wherever you want after the tour, and our whole group ended up going out for [even more] drinks. We ended up becoming friends and met up throughout the rest of our trip around Cape Town. This is definitely a wine tour for younger people and you will have a great time at these locally owned vineyards. You get a better feel for the culture of the area with this tour instead of just going to the huge corporate wineries. We met the owner of the winery at our last stop and he showed us the porcupine he caught that day in a cage and let us taste Prince Albert's wedding wine. The cheese tasting at Fairview was amazing! You will definitely end up buying cheese and wine to celebrate with your new friends on the rest of your trip."

Also, lunch is included in the price and the BBQ lunch was great and very yummy. In the end, we visited 4-5 wineries and that was the right amount! Definitely had had enough wine by the end of the day and was very happy. Great tour company, keep up the good work!"

Our guide (Granwell) collected us from our hotel and after few other pick ups we were on our way to Stellenbosch. 5 farms all in all ranging from small to massive corporate owned. Wine was excellent, cheese was divine and a great tour operator. Group was just the right amount of people (10) to be enjoyable and personal.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys wine."

The guide was excellent giving us lots of info on the local region as well as tons of knowledge on the wine making process. The tour visits 5 vineyards with around 6 wine tastings at each. The cheese, chocolate and biltong pairings all add to the experience. Lunch was delicious, the scenery amazing but most of all such a fun group of people from all corners of the globe :)"

Lots of laid back tastings paired with yummy food and like-minded people (if you're youngish, like to think you're still pretty cool and enjoy your wine). We visited five vineyards with Lord Vee and they were all very different but each great in their own way. Don't miss Fairview for the homemade goat's cheese or Lovane for the best reds! An excellent value day out and the perfect way to explore the Stellenbosch wine region."

Wine tours with Wine Flies aren\u2019t quiet, relaxed and slow\u2026 more exciting, fun and cool. I experienced different levels on each of my trips\u2014it definitely depends on the group you go with\u2014but all three have been awesome. I have done their traditional tour twice (they were slightly different both times, which I appreciated) and their Wine & Whales tour once. The team focuses on good wine, not big overly-commercial estates, so you go off the beaten \u201ctourist bus\u201d trail. They throw in biltong (dried meat) and chocolate pairings with some wineries\u2014and a few other small surprises too! The Whales tour was really cool because we went to some fairly far-off wineries that most people miss on the typical Stellenbosch area tour\u2014but some of the wineries we went to on this tour are favorites of my local Cape Town friends (and now mine!), so you know they are good.The most special thing about a tour with Wine Flies is the people\u2014Riaan and Granwell were phenomenal hosts and guides\u2014very well versed in wine (could answer any question I had) but more importantly, they were just plain awesome guys\u2014so funny and friendly to everyone on the tour. Sune was also fabulous\u2014she organized our bookings flawlessly every time\u2014and even joined one of our tours! As an American living in Cape Town, I\u2019ve brought 3 different groups of visiting friends on a Wine Flies Tour\u2014and they all raved about the day! I have another group coming in April/May and I\u2019m already including it in our itinerary!"

Fascinating.We toured Fairview, Muratie, Middelvlei, Lovane (chocolat) and lastly Vergenoegd estates with a braai at Middelvlei. We had our kids (11, 13 yrs old) with us and they were kept reasonably occupied by the animals at Middelvlei during lunch. Little reduction (100 Rand only) of tour price given for kids, bit of a disappointment. Costs per adult 650 Rand.Well done Lourence!

The train between Worchester to Matjiesfontein runs past the most beautiful landscape. Once in Matjiesfontein, the Karoo magic took over. The 5 minute bus tour, lamb chops under the Karoo sky, star gazing and the sing-a-long in the pub will be lifelong memories. Next morning stroll through the hotel gardens & a visit to the transport museum and off again to Cape Town. Beautiful scenery through the Keisie & Kogmanskloof regions and the lamb & shin potjie at Oupa Batt's was a highlight and really delicious.

I know nothing about wine and do not really care for it, but was looking for something relatively affordable that would take up a day. Wine Flies was perfect. Our guide Lord G was very knowledgeable. We went to 6 different wineries with a variance of wine. Our group was a lot of fun and everyone ended up going out after the tour. I recommend Wine Flies for young couples and singles. It is a great way to meet people."

I've done countless winery tours throughout the years and this definitely is the best. I was supposed to be doing the Stellenbosch with another tour company, but when they ignored my email queries, I decided to leave it to the concierge at my hotel to plan my day trips. And am I glad he picked Wine Flies!We were a full group of 13 (which surprised me since it was a Monday!), with G-man as our Wine Lord. Our group happened to be a young one and it was so much fun learning about wine-making as we toured the wineries in Stellenbosch - almost as much as we had drinking the wines .I've never tasted wine fresh out of the fermenting tanks or from an oak barrel - but G-man made it possible. This was a truly eye-opening experience for me personally, as it made me realise just how much differences there can be when a wine is not ready for bottling versus one that is already retailing on the shelves. We played musical chairs as we moved from one vineyard to another (so everybody knew everybody by the end of the day), and even had an exciting and intense quiz competition as we headed back to Cape Town. G-man even brought us chocolates and biltongs from his personal supplies to enhance our wine-tasting experience - and I have to admit, that this is a first in all the wine tours I've done throughout the years!If you're looking to do a wine tour in Stellenbosch, please do yourself a favour and do it only with Wine Flies. You won't regret it, I promise!"

Nothing was to much trouble, his depth of knowledge and passion for the tour and wine farms really came across in his story telling, facts and great sense of humour! It made me feel completely at ease from the start and made the tour as a whole so much more personable and fun.Choice of farms was excellent and the cheese, chocolates and lunch came at all the right times. It seemed like Louwrens had a personal relationship and connection to each of the farms which made it all the more of a friendly and enjoyable atmosphere! Would I recommend??.......yes, in a heartbeat. If I had more time I would go again. Thanks must go to Louwrens and all the wine farms for their knowledge and hospitality.Anthony"

I think this is the most varied tour I've ever been on, and certainly one of the best value for money tours I've ever seen.The full day tour included wineries (with very generous pourings), a small family-run cider business, a butcher that makes traditional bors, a fancy restaurant with spectacular views in the aptly named Heaven on Earth, and to conclude it all - whale watching in Hermanus. The guides were full of fascinating local knowledge and told things from the perspective of the pioneers who first arrived in this part of the world, pointing out old ox-cart trails as we drove along roads with grande vistas. And there were a couple of surprises thrown in too, but I won't mention them....One of the most impressive things for me on such a cheap tour was that Wine Flies seem to have chosen the farms and businesses they work with based on sound ethics. From restaurants that use locally grown foods, to the butcher who only uses the highest quality ingredients, to donating money to whale conservation with each trip. It cost R650 and I really think that price will go up soon as it seems way too good.Our guide even joined us afterwards for some \"beer tasting\" on Long Street and we had some more fun."

The Braai lunch was so awesome and by the end of the day we were all fast friends. definitely didn't feel like a number or just another tourist.

All told, with Wine Flies, we tasted about thirty different wines, paired with a wide variety of cheeses, some chocolate, and some meats. Lunch was delicious, and on a beautiful farm, and there were all sorts of extra treats, like getting to pull immature wines from a variety of casks to taste the differences between them, and a visit to a very high-end boutique winery run by an ex-rugby player for the Springboks. All in all, a great time, and an exceptional value for the money."

While there was cheese, it was only about 8-10 little cubes of it at the first winery. The meat was just a sampler of biltong passed around the bus in-between two wineries. The chocolate was a total of 4 small pieces at the last winery. Also, some of the wineries were a little skimpy on the tastings, even though we were buying bottles."

Very friendly, fun and knowledgeable about everything having to do with Wine. The drive out to the first winery was about 1 hour and from there the other wineries were close together - 5 to 15 minutes apart each.We got to visit 5 different wineries in just one day (picked up around 8:30am and dropped off around 6pm). It was a long day, but fun. Stellenbosch is beautiful and the wine at the different wineries was excellent. We got to taste about 6 wines at each winery, so a total of about 30 different wines - red, white, ports and dessert wines. We also got to pair with cheeses and chocolate at some of the wineries. It was great to visit the smaller wineries that are much less frequented by tours - very intimate and personal experience. Lunch was at a great farm/winery and was very good. It was funny how everyone in our group was so quiet in the morning and after all the wine by the afternoon we had quite a rowdy and loud group on the way back. Having 13 people (which is the max for the tour) was a lot. Overall, the value was excellent - price included everything (pickup, drop-off, entrance fees and lunch). If you want to see the winelands of Cape Town, then Wine Flies is a great choice."

It was a United Nations wine tasting tour to five fab wineries!! We visited rustic Annandale first where Pierre gave us a delightful tasting of four red wines; then we drove past scenic mountain ranges including Stellenbosch mountain to Lovane boutique winery where we tasted five more excellent red wines each with a different chocolate pairing; then to Middelvlei where amidst stunning rolling hills, large dogs, chickens and a wallaby (yes a real wallaby!) we enjoyed a delicious lunch of butternut squash soup, grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches, salad, chicken skewers and beef sausages followed by hot coffee while petting lovely friendly dogs including a huge black Great Dane, a Boer Bull and a little dachshund named Grappa! We had Chardonnay with our lunch as well as a Pinotage/Cab blend followed by a tasting of merlot direct from the barrel. We then drive all around Stellenbosch town viewing the University, the oldest house, lovely churches as we made our way to Villiera winery a young farm where we enjoyed 8 wine tastings of white wine and the South African \"champagne\" known as MCC \"method cap classified\" which included some delicious white wines and especially the Chenin Blancs were outstanding! Our last stop was the beautiful Fairview winery where we saw goats, a garden in the shape of the South African flag and polished off our outstanding day with five wines (white and red) paired with superb cheeses. Each winery had it's own unique flavor and the whole day out was so memorable and lovely despite rainy weather. Young or old - if you love wine make sure to take this tour.

After the last winery we were welcomed back to Cape town with the most gorgeous rainbow! We visited a total of 5 wineries and each was great, and each was different in some way. One place had cheese pairings, more than one place we had a full tour of the cellar even sipping straight from one of the barrels, one place we had brandy, one place we had lunch. Some places were big, some were small, some were very small, but each was well chosen and together made for a great day! Obviously a group of strangers who all chose to go wine tasting all day are bound to become fast friends, especially when drinking brandy and coke on the way home! You'll have a great time on this tour!Heads up if you have allergies: one of the wineries we visited has a tasting room cat, and another had a few very friendly dogs. I loved both of these places as an animal lover, but someone else on our tour had a cat allergy which did not go over so wel for him. Thanks Wine Flies! Highly recommend!"

It was a good tour in all respects -- informative, fun, well-paced, complete, and priced just right (approx. $60. U.S. per person). I was picked-up at my hotel on-time, and we were on our way for a narrated tour to Winelands. Our group of seven ranged from backpackers to a retiree (me). Everyone got along from the start, thanks in no small part to our friendly driver, Riaan. We started at a larger, big-distributor sort of place to get a soup-to-nuts tour of state-of-the-art wine-making. Then we tasted some wines -- the first of many tastes. Another taste was at a sizeable winery featuring cheese pairings as well. The remaining wineries of the day were smaller, family operations. We ended at very small places that you would not likely find on your own. Riaan made sure we got a good taste of the offerings, starting with some bubbly in the morning and a nightcap of local brandy before he bundled us back into the minivan. This is a perfect tour if you want a range of tastings, an excellent day in the country-side (including a vineyard/farmstead lunch), and a friendly (not snobby) attitude toward wine. Be prepared to sip conservatively (or spit) or you will consume a LOT of wine."

Our beautiful guide Louwrens made the day informative and interesting. He provided valuable insight not only into wine and the SA wine industry but was also a great resource for SA social history and culture - a real credit to the Wine Flies team.Feeling delicate from a previous night out, I was unable to sample many of the wines but can vouch for the quality of what I did have. Having done wine tours in France, Spain, Australia and NZ, this ranks as one of the best. Where else can you see a goat in a tower, kiss a (dead and stuffed) springbok and meet a rugby legend. Epic."

The guide, Granwell, was awesome, full of information, outgoing, and entertaining. We had a great group-mostly young people 20's-30's and a few middle-aged women in our group- and very diverse, coming from New Zealand, Australia, Holland, and the US. The wineries were all very unique. My favorites were Fairview, where they pair wine and cheese and the last stop with a rugby player's personal vineyard. It was a very relaxed atmosphere, not a \"stuffy\" wine tour. It lasted all day an included a lot of wine!! The mid-day meal was also very delicious and the animals there were very cute, including some nice dogs walking around. I highly recommend this tour!"

            "review": "Unforgettable Forgotten Route tour by Wine Flies. My boyfriend and I did the Forgotten Route overnight tour and I can't recommend it more highly, whether you've lived in Cape Town for years or are planning a visit to the region. The tour began in Greenmarket Square and continued with a walk through the Company's Gardens, during which our guide Riaan gave us a brief history of Cape Town and pointed out interesting architecture that most locals would never have noticed.From there we were driven to The Kimberley Hotel for a refreshment stop and then hit the road to begin our journey to the Karoo. The first day of the tour takes you to Kirabo winery for a wine and cupcake tasting (you can buy great value wines and experience family hospitality when you do the tasting), after which we boarded the train at Worcester to take us to Matjiesfontein. Well, actually, there was a bit of a delay in the train arrival, but rather than leave us languishing on the platform we were whisked off to a local pub and then back to the station in perfect time to hop aboard the train. You eat lunch on the train with beautiful scenery drifting past and can either take a nap (as some of the more sensible members of our tour did) or shoot the breeze with fellow group members, or retire to your cabin if you're not feeling that social. We arrived in Matjiesfontein and were checked into our rooms at The Lord Milner Hotel, after which we did probably the world's shortest (and funniest) red bus tour of the \"town\" (which is about two blocks long by two blocks long). While Riaan cooked us lamb chops on the braai for dinner, our group hung out in the hotel bar mingling, singing, dancing and having a good time to the sounds of live piano music. After a fantastic dinner you do a tour of one of the local museums (at night, spooky!) and then have the option of hitting the sack or heading back to the pub.Day two started with a great breakfast at the hotel, after which Riaan took us on a walking tour of the transport museum and the town itself. From there we departed in our tour bus back towards Cape Town, stopping along the way at a local graveyard, followed further along by an amazing home made lunch at Oupa Batt's shop (they also have the best biltong and dried fruit and we all stocked up with bags of both). After lunch we visited Kingna brandy distillery for a tasting (brandy lovers should make sure they budget so they can stock up on these superb brandies that are probably a third of the price of brandies from other distilleries that are equivalent in quality). From here we headed home to Cape Town through (more) beautiful scenery.The whole tour was so much fun, with Riaan keeping everyone's momentum going as well as providing us with loads of interesting history about all of the spots we visited. The best thing about the tour is that although you are part of a group, you can either revel in the fact of having a designated driver and go for that second (or third) glass of wine, or you can take things at a more moderate pace, anything goes and everyone was made to feel included and like they belonged by Riaan's hospitality. You could do the tour alone, with family, a partner or a bunch of friends, and have as much fun either way. What is more, it is amazingly good value for a two day tour, and that's coming from a local South African. If you live in Cape Town, do this tour, and if you're planning a visit to Cape Town, factor this in when making up your itinerary, you'll remember the experience for years to come."

We got to see some beautiful wine farms and I particularly enjoyed visiting Lovane and Annandale. You learn so much more visiting these smaller, family run farms than you would the larger, commercial farms and the experience is certainly far more memorable.The value is incredible! We got to taste so many wines, sample some cheese, chocolate, and biltong, and have lunch.I have to say I was a little disappointed with our guide -- I'm so sorry I forget his name! He was friendly and easy to talk to, but he was around 2 hours late to pick us up and sometimes his information sounded a bit \"scripted\". He was very apologetic and I understand these things happen sometimes, but this just didn't start our day the way we would have liked. Once we began the tour, things moved along quite well, but I think because of the initial delay we had to rush through some of the farms. It would have been nice to have been able to take some more time to explore them a bit.We toured on Good Friday which was a holiday, so some of the farms they normally visit were closed. When I originally booked I completely forgot this was a holiday and I may have considered booking the tour for a different day had I remembered because we didn't get to do a cellar tour and the spot we went to for lunch was okay. Our guide improvised well though and we still got to visit 5 farms.Despite the hiccups of our tour, I would recommend Wine Flies. I just kind of wish we had booked on a different day. The experience is certainly one of a kind!"

Being native to Cape Town the last thing I wanted was for a bus driver to stop at commercialized wine farms with no character. I was pleasantly surprised to see Riaan (or Lord Riaan) showing up at the hotel that I work at to pick me up for the day tour. There was no pretentiousness and he was very warm and welcoming. We picked up several other traveler from around the globe and we headed off for our day of excitement. A day of excitement may be an understatement - it was the most fun I've had in ages! Riaan is a wine expert so there was no rambling on about uninteresting facts, but rather well informed discussions with the group. We visited lesser-known farms and we were provided with an authentic experience. My favorite was the lunch stop at Middelvlei where we had a traditional South African Braai and Annendale where the person who conducted the tasting was informative and relaxed. Make sure to have a big breakfast since there is a lot of wine tasting and very little to eat - this was my fault of course for not having breakfast. I will suggest adding something more to nibble on than the biltong, dried fruit and chocolates. Something in the car (including water!) would have been appreciated. All in all the best wine tasting experience Ive had and I will gladly recommend this to anyone. It is best suited for a younger crowed and single travelers (you meet alot of people)."

We used trip advisor to look for a wine tour with good reviews, and that is why we book Wine Flies , We didnt regret it , it was such a nice day out visiting different wine farms around two main wine states. In the first one they show you how the process of making wine takes place and the tour guide gives you some advice on how to taste a wine and what properties to look at , there are different options of wine to taste in each farm so you will feel satisfied. In The second wine farm we had the opportunity to do wine and cheese pairing this is also really good, the place is called Farmview and has a really cool decoration you could also buy cheese , pastries , olive oil , marmelade. We had lunch in the third farm in the open the food was good and the views fantastic , I really enjoyed it. After lunch we visited 2 more farms and tasted more wine, the good thing about these farms are that they are small and family owned so they are very traditional and their wines are not mass produced or commercial , what i think makes them more exclusive perhaps. I recommend this tour as it is a good day out visiting different farms , tasting different wines , buying wine to take home , enjoying the views as we drive through the farms, it is a whole experience."

We came up with a little rhyme to sum the day up.Eight tourists went up to PaarlThought wine tasting was a ballThey started at 9By lunch they were fineBut by 5 they were starting to fallOverall and excellent day out, and fully recommended to anyone who likes wine."

Granwell was our Wine Lord and was great company from the moment we jumped in the minibus. We lost count how many farms we visited but i believe it was 5/6. The wine tasting was great and informative. Granwell was extremely knowledgeable and gave us a great understanding on how wine was produced and how to distinguish different wines. We had a great lunch at one of the farms in the company of some huge (but friendly) dogs. We cannot express how pleased we were with Wine Flies and Granwell, who made our day with his warm and friendly personality and being an all round nice guy. Thank you, Tom and Francesca."

Africa on our trip and they made it even more fun. We had cheeses, choc pairings with wine all very good. The only thing I would recommended to make it better is that the Lords offer guest crackers, bread and water in between wine farms as in our case we started at the first wine farm at 10am and didn't have lunch till about one. So I suggest you bring a snack. As I bought bread at the 4 th wine farm that had something to sell. It gets a little hard just drinking wine with no snack. But overall, I would highly recommend!"

Lord Riaan jampacked our tour with tidbits of culture, biltong, landscape, dried apricots, local history, cricket stories, biltong, oldfashioned trains, a homely waterblommetjie lunch, singing around the old piano in the pub, great lamb chops from the braai, stargazing in the beautiful and quiet Karoo night.

You get it all on this trip: the full tours of the barrels, vats, etc., cheese tasting, a lesson on wine tasting, a delicious lunch, explanations on the different processes, different types of wine, and regional wine history, and most of all, a lot, lot, lot of wine. When we were first looking, I thought \"I don't want all that other stuff, I just want wine,\" but the truth is that the \"other stuff\" is very interesting, breaks up the wine tasting nicely, and in terms of wine-for-your-money, this is still the best option if that's all you're concerned about. On that last point, watch your consumption and maybe even go like a pro and spit after tasting sometimes. Otherwise, it is really easy to get waaaaaay too drunk. Regardless, when this happened to us, Lord G still handled it like a professional and got us home safe and sound without flinching. He earned his tip on that day! Another piece of advice: don't make any plans for that evening aside from crashing out. Go for it and enjoy!"

The tour started off at one of the more commercial, slick and professional wine farms and then slowly goes 'downhill' from there during the course of the day until it ends up in an almost surreal experience at Hempies du Toit's Annandale farm. Let me be clear: 'downhill' in terms of commercialism, but 'uphill' in terms of realism (and good honest South African values and offerings). Both sides of this coin were excellent: the professionalism at the start was superb and the 'real characters' towards the end maybe even greater. Of course, the cheese, food and wine were also excellent throughout the day. Every part of experience is exactly what we would have wanted. Throughout all of this, \"Lord G\" did his thing just right - starting off the day as a professional tour guide and slowly becoming a friend (in the positive unforced and 'real' sense of the word). So, in one word: \"great\"! (and thanks)."

There were full tastings at all but the middle one, Middelvei, where was stopped for a delicious lunch--a boerebraai (farmer's barbecue). Some folks had a vegetarian option with pumpkin fritters and they loved it. Also, the butternut squash soup starter on a drizzly, cold day was excellent. I think if the weather had been nicer, I'd have given them five stars, but as we were often seated outside during some tastings or as most buildings don't have central heating, it was just a long, chilly day tempered by a lot of great wine (6 different wines at each full tasting). Louwrens was a great guide and for R595, so much is included (like lunch and full transportation, and a little friendly quiz among teams with the winning team taking home a free bottle). I might have settled for three farms and a shorter day (pick up around 8:15, drop off around 5:15). Well worth it!"

We visited five wineries -- one in Durbanville, two in Paarl and two in Stellenbosch -- plus another Paarl winery for a delicious lunch. The wines ranged from commercial to beyond excellent, and the price of the tour was made back with the value of the tastings many times over. Stunning scenery, good atmosphere and lots of great info in a relaxed, unpretentious setting. The group of people couldn't have been better -- we all hit it off right away and ended up going out together later for dinner and more wine. The only problem was the rather painful morning after; I haven't had a hangover like that in years. Worth it, though."

Lunch was served at a small winery with a vineyard, lots of land, two cute dogs, and a beautiful view of the mountains. Lord G was a fantastic leader and made our experience really wonderful! He encouraged the group to get to know each other and interact. We even had dinner together that night! A note that this tour tends to be better for those who want to interact with other tourists and is probably geared toward a younger crowd, although our group was certainly not rowdy.

The average age on our tour was 27, and we had a perfect mix of people from different countries and backgrounds. If you want to have a lot of fun while also enjoying and learning about delicious wines, you shouldnt look anywhere other than Wine Flies. You wont regret it, I guarantee it."

We found Wine Flies just by searching Google and we wanted a small personable wine tour but also a bit more than just a glorified wine bar crawl. Wine Flies was perfect for what we wanted.They pick you up from your location and the maximum group size is 13. Everyone is friendly and the tour guide is very knowledgeable without making it pretentious. We visited 5 vineyards in total, ranging from a large commercial farm to several small family run vineyards. There was a lot of wine to taste (always good) and lunch was included.At the end of the trip, there is a quiz with the prize being a bottle of wine - listen carefully throughout the day and it's easy winnings!Overall, great day out!"

Our 13 person multinational, multi-aged group visited 2 wineries in Paary, had a brai lunch on a delightful farm/winery, drove through Stellenbosch town, and visited 2 more wineries in Stellenbosch.

We visited 5 \u201cfarms\u201d ranging in size from a couple of acres where they hand press the grapes to a rather large very commercial venture that had some very good cheeses. Unfortunately at the end of the day I left a package of apricot brie in the van at the end of the day. Our group of 11 included a couple from Alaska, a German woman, a couple of Danish women, 3 or 4 Brits and a Belgian. Our driver/guide was a very knowledgeable Italian.The wines are very inexpensive, ranging in price from about US$5 to under US$20 for the most expensive. At on farm I asked the cost of shipping a case back home and found that the shipping cost would have been about $350. I just couldn\u2019t justify spending R(and) 267 to ship a bottle of R125 wine, granted, even with the shipping it\u2019s not particularly expensive wine. For reference, yesterday at dinner I paid R35 (about US$4) for a glass of one of the more expensive wines on the menu at a nice restaurant."

The experience far exceeded our expectations! The tour was crafted to balance boutique Wine Estates with larger vineyards. We learned all about wine country through a colorful history told as we passed by landmarks and the information actually stuck. Our guide, Raiin, brought the group together through his sense of humor and deep knowledge of Stellenbosch and wine making. At every Wine Estate it was clear that the owners and managers knew our guide well and were all the friendly and more helpful to the group for it. This was a fantastic Wine Tour and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone."

He shared abundantly from his knowledge and showed us a couple of really good wineries. He tells really bad jokes, but keeps spirits up until the wines take over.A few of the wineries are tourist traps and we did see one of those, but the treat was the last two wineries of the tour when our guide took us to one unknown gem, and then to finish off, one of the more eccentric winemakers in the Stellenbosch region. The wine was superb and the ambience was great. I hate airline luggage restictions as the great wines is really cheap at the vineyards.A great day out, and a great way to see and taste the Cape."

Riaan led our group and he was fantastic - he was great at making it an entertaining and enjoyable experience while we learned a lot about wine! He was talkative, informative, and made the members of the group comfortable from the start. During the day we visited several wineries of different sizes and all with different offerings. We tasted wine on its own, tasted wine with food, poured our own wine, and had a laugh. All in all, we highly recommend this tour if you are looking to taste wine and learn about it in a fun and friendly way."

As a semi-tourist to Cape Town, and a California native, I felt it was a good idea to take a full day to tour the Winelands of Stellenbosch, etc. There are many ways I could have done this. I could have mooched a ride of a friend or roommate, thus making them be the designated driver (sorry...no international driver's license!). I could have taken a train out to Stellenbosch, and then figured out how the heck I would be getting around, where I would be going and spending a large amount of money to do it. I could have hired a driver, to the tune of big bucks. OR...I could take an organized tour. Why choose Wine Flies for your tour company? Simple. Value, Fun, and Knowledge. I was picked up at my home, driven everywhere all day, forced to drink delicious wine, made to laugh with random strangers who became drinking buddies, and damn if I didn't also have to learn about wine-making from both in front of the wine bar and the insider's only way to learn...behind the scenes of the winery itself.Our Tour Guide, or \"WineLord\" for the day was Riaan. Besides being totally charming, and informative with his wine knowledge, I felt very safe having him as our Designated Driver for the day. I didn't ever feel that we were rushed in our tour (which lasted something like 8 hours!), and felt like we were totally taken care of and made to have a fun and memorable time. By the end of the tour, we were friends!I definitely recommend very strongly that if you are doing a wine tasting tour...do it with a knowledgeable and safe company. Wine Flies hit the spot. Do it. And don't forget to have a blast an to tip your Guide when the day is done (it is NOT asked of you....but you will be happy to do so, since you had such a great tour)."

This was a perfect introduction to a first visit to Cape Town & Paarl, Franshhoek & Stellenbosch. From trip planning to execution, we were very happy with all services provided. Jurie is very personable, knowledgeable, congenial, attentive and provides great insights for visitors to this very beautiful part of South Africa. We made it to the top of Table Mountain, despite some early morning rain due to his flexibility & persistent checking to learn when the cable car re-opened.Thanks also go to Madelaine Kinsman for organizing all our day tours including a tour to Robben Island. We were in very capable hands. I would highly recommend PG Tops & Jurie Brand to travellers coming to the Cape.Well done.John Cosgrove Calgary, Canada"

From the first email to the end of the last tour, PG Tops and its staff was professional, attentive and on top of it all, even when our scheduled kayaking with the penguins excursion was cancelled. I worked with Madelaine for weeks ahead of my visit to make sure we would make the most of our trip! She selected the perfect tour guides for each of our days, give us a well rounded and amazing experience! Cape Point TourOur group of three had Richard for the Cape Point Tour, he was extremely knowledgeable and gave us the background. He was flexible with our schedule and was able to get us to all the stops. He even humored us when we wanted to stop to see the wildlife. Cape Winelands TourGavin was an awesome guide for our Winelands Tour, he selected wineries catering to our party of two's extremely polar opposite palettes! Despite a rainy day, we enjoyed everything the Cape Winelands had to offer and had an amazing delectable day! Horseback Riding/Kayaking Even though our excursion to kayak with the penguins was cancelled, Carl took us horseback riding on the beach. Like both Richard and Gavin, he gave us educational commentary of Cape Town and made suggestions on how to best make the most of the remaining time on our holiday. All three of our tour guides were AWESOME They each provided a unique perspective and gave us a well rounded view of the wonderful things Cape Town has to offer as well as a sneak peek at life in the Mother City. I highly recommend PG Tops and their guides - they are a must when traveling to Cape Town. I will be sure to use them again if I am ever back in Cape Town!!"

It was very well planned after communication with Ingrid, especially considering that we wanted to do and see as many things as possible. Our guide was Jurie - he was very helpful and informative. Due to weather conditions, our shark dive was cancelled on its scheduled date. We wanted to visit Cape Aghulas as an alternative and Jurie was happy to drive us there. I would also like to thank Jurie, Ingrid and Yolanda who helped us book the shark dive on another day, after our Garden Route tour was over. The accommodation guesthouses chosen were also very beautiful and had good service, however they were a bit far from the centre so it might be a bit uncomfortable to stay out late at night, however Jurie always offered to drive us and come pick us up whenever we went out in the evening."

Provia even squeezed in a visit to an Ostrich farm that my mom wanted to visit. Provia was wonderful on our 2nd day when we last minute switched from the Hermanus day trip to a Wine tour. This trip was on the last day of our trip, and was the first time in 4 days that Table Mountain was open, so she stopped at Table Mountain for us on the way to wine country. Her flexibility was amazing! We would definitely recommend Provia and PG Tops for any Cape Town tours!"

First of all, Sofie Otto put together a private tour for me that was exactly what I wanted. It covered all the important sites and a lot of fun sites. She was aware of my mobility issues and took that.into consideration. She assigned a guide named Jamie, who is truly amazing. We are getting along like long lost family. She is so patient with me because of my walking problems and my use of a walker. She is extremely knowledgable and personable. One day they asked if I would mind them sending a trainee with us to the vineyards. It was fine with me ( the more the merrier ). Imogen came along. She was previously a ranger and decided to become a tour guide. She was also extremely knowledgable and personable. She will be an awesome tour guide when her training is finished.

Since we had never been there before, we felt that using a tour company to ensure that we made the best use of our time was a good idea. Yes it was! We booked 2 full days with PG Tops and one half day, to the Langa Township, which I will review separately. Our guide for the two full days was Provia. On our first full day we traveled to Cape Point. On the second day, she took us to the wineries. The drive to Cape Point was beautiful as we drove along the coast. Even though we had a few showers as we drove, every time we got out of the van the skies cleared and the views were amazing. We visited Cape Point, the Lighthouse and on the way back to Cape Town stopped at Boulders Beach to see the Penguin colony and passed through Simon's Town. On our second day with Provia, she helped us customize our tour. I had been encouraged to visit Franschoeck and we wanted to have something other than only wineries for our kids, ages 17 & 11. Provia organized a day where we visited a Lion Refuge, stopped to tour Franschoek and visited two wineries. The Lion Rescue Park has rescued lions from zoos and the circus and cares for the mistreated and injured animals. The pens for the lions were huge, each lion's history was posted so that we could understand how they came to the refuge. Franschoek was a quaint town with a lot of arts, restaurants and beautiful architecture. We visited our first winery in Paarl, Fairview Winery, and then traveled to Stellenbosch for lunch. After lunch we visited Ernie Els Winery in Stellenbosh Central. It was a beautiful 2 days of touring the Cape Town countryside. Having a tour company that was willing to customize and accommodate our interests as well as provide suggestions we were not aware of, greatly enhanced our appreciation and enjoyment of our visit."

Being discerning travellers, we often have high expectations of our trips and know for a fact that one thing that makes or breaks your tours/holidays is having the right guide. Witty, patient and accommodating Merryl made our customised trip through various parts of Cape Town a very informative and entertaining experience. It felt more like a trip with a relative who packed in facts and anecdotes as she guided us on the best routes to take while going up to see the lighthouse at the Cape of Good, ways to beat the crowd to view the penguin colony at Boulders Beach and the patience to stop at the right places to get the best view and shots along Chapman's Peak Drive, even accommodating our quirky request for 'animal-crossing' signs! It takes a lot to impress us but Merryl won us over her with her passion and vast knowledge of practically every topic that we spoke of, not just the places that we visited/passed by.At the end of the day, we came away with not only memories of gorgeous sights and places but made a lovely, new friend :)"

We did the Cape Town City tour, wine land tour, whale watching tour as well as the Cape Peninsula tour with PG Tops- we had no regrets choosing them.At the airport, Merryl was there waiting patiently for us and brought us promptly to the hotel to get our holiday started.As my dad could get a little grumpy, Merryl had been absolutely patient and kind throughout the trip and was really thoughtful. Apart from being a totally safe driver, she is also very knowledgable on the different subjects including geography, history, botany as well as wines! She just has so many ideas and thoughts!If you are looking for just a driver, you could probably get one easily. BUT to get a safe driver AND a guide who could talk about almost any subject with confidence, it would be a rarity. Merryl is one such gem in the hospitality industry in Cape Town.Indeed, I find most organised tours to be rushed, and not attentive to needs of less abled passengers, and in most cases, boring to say the least. I find my private tour to be totally relaxing, flexible, and thoroughly interesting. I would give a high recommendation for PG Tops and Merryl if you are planning your trip to Cape Town."

It was a good decision, much more relaxing and with the added value of the historical and cultural perspective the guides could provide. Oriane in the PG Tops office was super to work with - very helpful and responsive.Our first day out with PG Tops was a private tour of the Cape Peninsula with Carel. Carel was great - very knowledgeable and personable. He managed to side-step any potential crowds, affording us largely unobstructed views and overall a more personal experience. He also has eagle eyes and was able to show us wildlife along the way, including shy eland camouflaged in the bush. He is also an avid scuba diver and shared a lot of his local knowledge re: dive sights, etc. Since we are not divers ourselves, this was only of passing interest.Our second day out with PG Tops was a trip to Cape Winelands with Sarina and Mike. Both were lovely and set a nice pace for the day (Sarina as the guide and Mike in training). Since we were planning to be dropped off in Franschhoek at the end of the tour, our goal was to get an overview of Cape Winelands enroute. We made stops in Stellenbosch (The Spice Route), Paarl (Lanzerac), and Franschhoek (Boschendall and Grande Provence). We had a tasty and beautiful lunch at Boschendall Winery overlooking the kitchen gardens. Our only regret is that it really was a large, heavy meal, and we would've been happier doing something less formal.Overall, we would highly recommend PG Tops. They are very professional and friendly, their automobiles are comfortable and well maintained, and they have put great thought into their itineraries."

He started off by asking us what we specifically wanted out of the day and if there was anything in particular that we wanted to see. In addition to the Cape of Good Hope and the Penguins we wanted to stop at Haut Bay and see the seals. He was very informative and made several stops along our drive to the Cape to let us take pictures. We saw and learned so much that day. I would highly recommend a private tour. It was tailored specifically to us and what we wanted to do and see. Deon was the perfect guide! We enjoyed our day with him!"

She was highly responsive to emails and even scheduled a Skype call so she could better understand our group's desired experience. She booked us with Leslie, since we are a younger group, and he was awesome! He was so flexible, personable and a delight. He really catered to our every need as we dove with sharks, visited Table Mountain & Cape Point (even going to \"rescue\" the 5 in our group who thought hiking up Table Mountain was a good idea) and went touring in the Winelands. He totally understood us and took us to great, local spots for meals and showed us more than we would have thought to ask for. He somehow managed to corral the 8 of us rambunctious ladies so we didn't miss anything we wanted to do, which was definitely a challenge. We wouldn't have had nearly as fantastic or fun a time without him. Highly recommend!"

We had an awesome day out and truly enjoyed our Cape Town experience.Cheers!Jessica and Eric Maney"

I was in South Africa for 2 weeks with my friends. We stayed in Cape Town for 4 days. Prior coming to CPT, I arranged our trip with Sofie and she was so amazing and easy to communicate with. When we arrived to the airport, we were a little late, but our tour guide Richard was waiting for us patiently. He had such beautiful and sincere smile. Richard was so friendly and very informative. He gave us the full history about Langa Township and told us about what to expect when were in town- drove us around the town and even made us walk around the town and interact with the locals/residents. That was the best part of the trip- the best way to understand the culture and the lives of some of South Africans!! The next day, we went Geoffrey. Geoffrey was funny and pleasant to be around. He was full of personality, we ran around the city with him on our way to the boat ride to Robben Island (it was a good exercise, we needed it haha). But before that he also took us around the city (we saw beautiful colorful houses/mosques). Table Mountain was closed that day so we were not able to make it with him, but Jarred who also worked PG Tops took us few days later. Jarred was also as amazing as Richard and Geoffrey. He was so flexible. We told him that we did not want to go to Wineland tour and instead we asked him to around the city and market. He did it without any hesitation. Honestly, PG Tops and its staff couldn\u2019t be better."

Our first day included a Table Mountain tour and then a city tour, all accompanied by Yolanda's great knowledge of the history of Cape Town and the country. We parted company after about 6 hours, in time to catch the ferry to Robben Island.The following day, as Yolanda was away, we had a different guide, Leslie, a very personable and knowledgeable young man who drove us to Cape Point, and all the points in between such at Simonstown, Camps Bay , Kalk Bay, the penguin colony etc., all the while keeping us informed about the history of the area. Leslie also accompanied us on a tour of the Winelands the following day, with stops at three wineries, each of which had a distinct personality. That, plus Leslie's knowledge of the wines, made the trip very interesting. We had lunch in Franschoek and then made our way back to Cape Town.All in all, the arrangements we made with PG Tops worked out extremely well, and were flexible enough to allow for changes if there was something we preferred to eliminate or add."

Lots of driving and the simple things like a really nice vehicle make the difference. We went to wine country and did some wine tours and then spent the night in Franschhoek. Next day drove to Cango Caves and a large Ostrich farm including riding an ostrich. Then onward to Plettenberg Bay. Next day some local tours plus Zip lining. Final day a long drive back to Capetown. All the time Sarina was wonderful. She was interesting and knowledgeable, but it really became more than that. Started feeling more like a friendship and we wish her all the best"

Our first day was spent visiting the scenic Table Mountain and Signal Hill.

On the second day we toured the Cape Peninsula where we were greeted with incredible scenery, fur seals and penguins. On our last day we visited the Aquila safari after a 2 hour drive from Cape town and returned to Cape town by around 4pm in the afternoon. All in all, our experience was wonderful, with huge thanks to PG Tops, Yolanda (for coordinating everything before we headed to Cape town), and Paula, our tour guide."

We had transportation from the airport to the hotel included in 3 of the days that we used their services.We had transportation from the airport to the hotel included on our first night arrival. We were to be greeted at the airport by a representative of the company with our name on a sign. He was there on time and assisted our travel companions to the hotel, it was perfect. My husband and I had a problem, our flight from the US was 3 hours late and did not make our connection in JNB and did not arrive in Cape Town until the next morning. This was extremely frustrating and disappointing to us because our tour of the Peninsula was to start 45 minutes before we ever landed. This is where I give a BIG THANK YOU to PAUL our guide from PG Tops. He picked up the other couple at the hotel and was at the airport to greet us when we landed. Paul made sure that we realized that this unexpected delay was not going to ruin our vacation.Paul was with us for 2 full day tours ( the second day was a City Tour) and we did not miss anything that we had planned to see with their help. He was knowledgeable about the history, the people, the landscape and the animals. He was fun and considerate. He was so in tuned to the slightest thing that he thought we would want. He made sure we had a complete and enjoyable time. He had our tickets and entrances fees to the sight already purchased and he knew all the ins and outs to expedite our valuable time.Paul was a true Professional and I would highly recommend him and PG Tops Travel in Cape Town.

With just a single day to see the out-of-town sights after a visit to Cape Town, my choice of tour guide for my group of friends was important. With help from TripAdvisor, I reached out to a handful of tour companies. Only two responded with interest in providing us a custom, private tour. The first was PG Tops. The second was fully booked, and referred us to... PG Tops.Over a handful of emails, I shared our priorities (the penguins at Boulders Beach and Cape Point), and left the rest to the team there. They made it easy for me to share information with my friends, they communicated effectively (all via email, as I wanted) as we planned the trip. They paid attention to everything going on -- from the Two Oceans Marathon, with road closures they anticipated and planned around, to weather.Carel picked us up at our hotel on schedule. The van he drove us around in all day was comfortable. He was a font of knowledge, about everything in the area. He took us to great look out (read: photo op) points all throughout the day. He got us to Boulders before any other humans showed up, allowing us to spend some quality time with the penguins who hung out on the beaches outside the protected colony. He found several great spots on the way to Cape Point to experience the landscape, the views, and even the intense wind.We all appreciated his flexibility, too. One of my friends had to head back to Cape Town to catch a flight while the rest of us stayed behind, and the team at PG Tops planned it advance and Carel executed perfectly, planning a lunch for us while he met the airport transfer with our friend.It was a whirlwind day, and thanks to Carel and PG Tops, we got to see and do everything we wanted -- and more. That day was a perfect end to our visit to Cape Town. I would definitely call them again for Cape tours. The price was fair, the hospitality was excellent, and everything worked exactly as promised! Thank you so much!"

Went on a city tour, district 6 museum, Table Top Mountain via revolving gondola, and finished with the highlight - A tour of Langa township. So much to take in and made memorable with Godfrey's knowledge and insight to the area.Second tour was with Deon and the Cape Peninsular. Very knowledgeable about area and included penguin colony, funicular railway up to lighthouse. A windy warm day where we saw ostriches and baboons as well.Third day was also with Deon. This time it was the wine district tour without the wineries - This amused Deon. We went to Cheetah sanctuary which was a definite highlight to see work with cheetahs plus opportunity to stroke one, Followed by tour of district and brief stops at Stellensbosch and Franschoek plus an amazing motor museum.Thank you so very much for making our stay in Cape Town so memorable."

Over the three days we visited some of Cape Town\u2019s most beautiful sights (Table Mountain, The Cape of Good Hope, Boulders beach, Hout Bay, Stellenbosch to name a few) and we also got to feed seals, see amazing natural stones & crystals and snap amazing shots of the different wildlife. Apart from the fact that he is a really lovely person (witty, interesting and accommodating) he was professional & enthusiastic about what he does. I have been on many tours in many different countries and he is definitely one of the best. Carel is a great ambassador for Cape Town. I would highly recommend him. Thanks for looking after my family and I!"

We had four tours booked with PG Tops this Feb/Mar 2016 and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them, they were punctual, reliable and very knowledgable.  We had yolanda, Carle and Jarred conduct our tours all of which were really lovely friendly people, without being at all intrusive they were all very professional.

When we came down there were really big queues to go up.We did the penguins, seals and Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope, plus the winelands.He was great as he was born in South Africa and knew so much about the place where ever we went"

My mother and I visited Cape Town on holiday and were put in touch with PG Tops after we contacted another tour guide, Clive, who was fully booked. We wanted a tour company who could arrange customised trips based on our preferred itinerary and PG Tops fulfilled this brief admirably. Sarina took us on a full-day tour to Cape Point, Simon's Town and the Boulders Beach penguins. She also added in a boat trip to a colony of seals which was great too. The trip was such a success that we booked 3 further trips with PG Tops. On the last trip, we were lucky to have owner Pieter personally take us round the Constantia vineyards. Highly recommended.

Donna picked us up on time and after stopping off to see the Sea Lions we stopped at a lovely spot for a coffee. Then on towards Cape Point with a quick unscheduled stop at a winery, Donna is a fountain of knowledge and during our journey kept us entertained with details of the areas that we passed through, historical information and the many languages of South Africa. Cape Point is an amazing location and Donna stopped twice to rescue errant tortoises that decided to cross the road in front of us. Then on to the lighthouse and a lovely lunch - Donna managed to organise a table for us so that we didn't have to queue. Finally to Boulders Beach to see the penguins, not to be missed! We had a great day out and would recommend PG Tops to anyone and a huge thank you to Donna for a great day, it wouldn't have been the same without you."

After reading through T.A. for tour guide recommendations, we emailed Madelaine at PG tours and asked her about the Cape Point / Peninsula. She put together a great tour based on a couple questions around what we wanted to see and whether we wanted to just sit and ride or get out and do easy walking or take a bit more of a hike. Our tour guide, Gavin, picked us up on our hotel in a comfortable clean vehicle and off we went for a fabulous day of travel, sights and even a brisk hour hike up one of the trails around Cape Point (the highlight of our tour). Lunch in a small seaside town. Gavin's been in the tour business awhile and seems to know how much information is useful and when to just let the scenery do the talking. He also had some great tips on what to do/ where to go for some gifts we needed in Cape Town proper. Had us home to the minute when scheduled! He also was very clever about which route to take on the weekend to be ahead of the bigger crowds at the most popular stops. To be honest, i'd read that all the tour guides with PGT were good, but when we go back, we'll definitely ask for Gavin again! Given that I've been going to C.T. for almost twenty years, I really appreciated that Gavin got how much we knew and how to shift around the plans to make the trip perfect!"

The brief was very simple - we wanted to experience the sights and scenes of South Africa for 2 weeks, the first period around the Cape Town and coastal area and then move on to a few days safari in Kruger.Sofie was very professional and attentive and asked us what we liked, what level of comfort we were looking for, what food we enjoyed eating, where we liked to stay, what in particular we would like to see and so on.Nothing seemed to be an issue and Sofie e mailed us on numerous occasions and even spoke to us on the phone to try to understand our requirements more specifically.The result was a fantastic vacation staying in sumptuous accommodation, eating some lovely S African food, seeing great sights and having one of the best holidays we have ever had.Credit should also be heaped upon our guide - Johan. Throughout the Cape leg of the holiday Johan drove us over 2000km. We struck a chord with many common views and hobbies and the places we stopped at were often revised following these conversations.Vacation consisted of the following:Day 1 Arrival at CapeTown, tour of table mountain and part of city accommodation More seasons.Day 2 Penguins at Stormy point. Accommodation More SeasonsDay 3 Robben Island and Peninsula. Accommodation More SeasonsDay 4 Wine tasting in Franshoek, Motor Museum. Accommodation Le Quartier FrancaisDay 5 Alloe Fera factory, Ostrich Farm Accommodation De DenneDay 6 Knysna Featherbed visit. Accommodation Atlantic houseDay 7 Transport museum George, bird sanctuary Tsitsikama. Accommodation The FerneryDay 8 Addo National Park, Port Elizabeth Accommodation Radisson BluDay 9-12 Fly to Kruger for Safari at Lion Sands Private Game reserveOverall this offered a personalised private tour that was tailored to our requirements for a similar price to a good tour organised in the UK but with around 30 people. That personal touch and ability to modify at a moments notice was priceless and I have no hesitation to recommend the company.thanks again to Sofie, Johan and Peter at PG Tops"

My friend and I were to arrive in Cape Town on a cruise ship around 8 a.m. Our flights home were not until 6 p.m., so we were looking for a tour company that could introduce us to the sights of Cape Town and deliver us to the airport in time. I had spent quite some time in the city previously, but my friend had not. I found PG Tops Travel and Tours on Trip Advisor and made arrangements with Yolanda. Sarina was at the dock 10 minutes early ready to go. I had hoped to take the cable car to Table Mountain, but the fog prevented us from doing that. Sarina substituted Signal Mtn and a visit to Rhodes Monument where we were able to have great views of the city. We visited Hout Bay, walked through the central city, had lunch and shopped at the wharf area. It could not have been more perfect. I highly recommend this company."

And then they picked us up at the cruise ship the next day. We had different guides each day. What we appreciate the most is being able to talk with the guides, ask questions and have meaningful conversations about the city and the country. It was like having a friend show you around. The highlight for me was Boulder beach and thousands of penguins. But the Cape was a bucket list item - it was just so very windy. Our visit to Cape Town was fun and informative.

We did 4 days of touring with PG Tops (2 Days of Winelands, 1 Day Shark Cage Diving, and 1 Day Peninsula Tour), and it was money well spent! Our guides, Bianca and Ryan, had a ton of local knowledge, so we ended up saving time (we started our Peninsula tour early to avoid having to queue) and visiting some places we never would have found on our own (we visited a couple of great wineries that we'd never heard of and Ryan also recommended the most delicious Fish and Chips shop in Simonstown). Both Ryan and Bianca were super friendly and flexible (my husband decided that there was one particular winery he wanted to visit, so Ryan rearranged our day's plans to make sure we had time to visit it), so all four days were relaxing and stress free.One of the fun surprises for me was the Wine and Chocolate Pairing at Spier Winery. We live in Switzerland, so I was skeptical about how good the chocolate could be compared to Swiss chocolate ;), but it was super unique and delicious! The chocolates had different flavors that paired with different wines, but the real surprise was how the chocolate flavor changed the taste of the wine! Super interesting! Thanks, Bianca, for recommending that we try it!I can't wait for another chance to visit South Africa and discover more with PG Tops!"

We were an extended family of 05 Adults + 03 Senior Citizens (65 plus) + 02 Teenagers + 04 Children (between 05 - 09yrs) and were visiting Cape Town & The Garden Route for the first time, that too during the peak months of December. We approached PG Tops quite late in September to take care of our itinerary planning, ground arrangements & guide for a Personalized Experience. The first e-mail itself from Ms.Yolanda was a nerve soother and we knew we were in safe hands. Complete professionalism in planning the itinerary, considering we were to complete the Garden Route from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth in 03 days flat, suggesting attractions, places to eat with due consideration for us vegetarians with kids and complete transparency in communication of the charges and the payment schedules. The icing on the cake (which we later discovered while on the tour) was their suggestion to pre-book reservations at restaurants considering the size of the group, cuisine preferences & the peak season (25th December to 30th December), that's a personal touch par excellence !!! Lots of blessings from all family members to Ms.Yolanda & the entire PG Tops team for this.Arrival day, Christmas eve, we missed connecting flights and upset our arrival schedules. The PG Tops Private Guide Mr. Rod & driver Mr. David ensured they picked us up post midnight, informed the hotel about the delay, ensured rooms were allotted and a speedy check-in with sleepy kids.The biggest satisfaction undoubtedly on the tour has been Mr. Rod (our guide), vast experience, very knowledgeable, soft spoken, a hit with the kids and the seniors of the family alike. He has ensured that all attractions as per our itinerary have been enjoyed by the family at Cape Town and along the Garden Route as well, reconfirming room reservations, restaurant reservations as well as flight timings. A personal Thank You Rod & David for your efforts, God Bless You You can't get any better service than this!!! A dream vacation coming together !!! "

I was really hoping she was going to be our guide and was surprised when it was someone else but the day still went well. My daughter and I travel extensively and know what we want to see. Normally I rent a car but decided we were packing in a wine tour as well and I won't drink and drive so a guide was the best route. We swam with penguins, rode camels, saw Cape Point, and took some amazing pictures at the color beach huts of Muizenberg Beach and did a wine tasting tour at a beautiful winery. I know at times our tour guide may have been frustrated with our itinerary and tried to substitute another beach for Muizenberg that didn't work for us,so we held strong and required our original stop, but overall we got along fine and he was super knowledgeable about every aspect of our tour. He was a wealth of information and I was really impressed with his intelligence. I'm very glad that we chose this tour company and I think you can't go wrong in booking with PG Tops Travel and Tours. The are responsible, professional in all communications, and definitely priced well compared to other vendors that I interviewed. Thanks for a wonderful day!!!!"

Jerrod was so informative and personable and really made it a fantastic tour. Would HIGHLY recommend PG Tops to anyone looking to go on a day tour of Cape Town."

After our hike, Bianca took us to an ostrich farm to feed them which was fantastic. She also drove us around for a while to show us all the animals in the area which was so much fun.

The initial enquiry was handle in a professional and friendly manner by Sarina Venter who provided all the information we needed and dealt with any queries promptly.Both trips were excellent and a real highlight of our trip. Our guide Donna Oosthuizen was absolutely fantastic and could not have been more helpful. She was knowledgeable about the history, animals and fauna of South Africa and knew all the best places to go including secluded beaches and short cuts to avoid the Cape Town traffic! Nothing was too much trouble and it was like travelling with my big sister, she helped look after our son and tailored both days around our preferences and nothing was too much trouble.

They were recommended by friends who used them last year and we now owe those friends an appreciation cocktail. From the very first email inquiry, I knew that we were in good hands.I cannot possibly say enough kind words about Sarina, our coordinator. I looked forward to every email response that I received from her. We were a group of five, all with differing thoughts on itineraries and juggling changes and recommendations and additions was no problem at all. Sarina was on it every step of the way with kind words, professionalism and a fantastic sense of humor.We used them for our airport transfer (Sarina was gracious enough to pick us up at 11:00pm), a tour to Gansbaai (stopped for whale watching, lunch at a winery and a pick up of a friend who did the shark dive) and a full day tour to Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope and an ostrich farm. And transport to and from a wedding (sorry Pieter ;-) For the day tours, our guide was Jarred and he is terrific! Super knowledgeable, not only on sites and history, but plant life and ecosystems. He was very accommodating, very entertaining and quite funny. We all really enjoyed his guide skills and friendly nature.And for every transfer and pick up, not only did they arrive on time, but 5 minutes early which we appreciated (tho, we may not have been ready, we loved the punctuality).And note, Sarina is now a full fledged tour guide. If you are lucky enough to have either of them, you will have a great time.We feel like we made friends in Cape Town and hope to return soon and take advantage of other tours that they offer and their generous and genuine hospitality."

Ryan met us at the designated time with a well-maintained van. The Cape Peninsula was beautiful and Ryan arranged for lunch at a restaurant that easily catered to the many vegans in our group. On the Winelands tour, Ryan selected three distinct wineries that met our taste and had pre-booked wine tastings at each. He picked a wonderfully scenic winery-restaurant for lunch and had informed them of our vegan requests prior to arrival. What a treat was it to have Ryan show us around these two days!Booking the tours via email and payment via their provided secure link was a breeze. I would not hesitate to use PG Tops again and, in particular, Ryan, should we visit Cape Town in the future!"

We ended up having three different guides during our week in Cape town due to having to break up our tour days across a week. Rudi gave us a tour of the city of Cape Town that included all the typical attractions. The tour was a good starting point for us as we had arrived late the previous evening. The winds kicked up and the 'tablecloth' surrounded Table mountain so we had to postpone our tour up the mountain for another day. For our safari at Inverdoorn, Jared picked us up from our hotel and actually rode along in the Land Rover with us while on safari which was helpful with his previous experience as a safari guide. We were able to ask him questions/comments that he saw on the day at Inverdoorn on the ride back to Cape Town. For the Biscuit Mill, township tour, and Stellenbosch trip we had Godfrey. The walking tour through the streets of the Langa township was authentic and made you feel like you were able to see exactly how the people that live in those types of settings live day to day. Godfrey is very well known in that area and we felt comfortable learning about the area with him as our guide. Our last two days around Cape Town were again spent with Jared around Cape Point and Cape Peninsula. We felt extremely comfortable with Jared and his approach with customers is top notch. All the trips were outstanding and we overall felt very lucky to have PG Tops organize our trip for us and cater to what we either did or didn't want to see while we were on vacation. Originally we had pursued Clive to be our tour guide but he kindly referred us to PG Tops. Initially we felt disappointed to not had reserved Clive without enough advance notice but in the end were thrilled with PG Tops. Sofia was our main contact person ahead of time and her timely and professional responses to our emails showed us that they ran a good business and cared about their customers. If we ever go back to Cape Town (hopefully someday :) we would definitely reserve PG Tops to guide us around again! Thank you to PG Tops (and especially Rudi, Godfrey, and Jared)!"

After flying into Cape Town late the prior evening with my wife and my twin 11 year old daughters, we awoke to what we now understand to be a fairly typical strong breeze for Cape Town in the warmer months. So strong that the table mountain cable car was on wind hold! With that our plans to go up table mountain went out the window, so we decided to try and get on a tour out to the cape of good hope. Having discovered that most organised tours had already left that morning, I rang several private tour operators and they all were full - not surprising given I was calling for an appointment for that same day! One referred me to PG Tops. Having had a quick look on the website and the trip advisor ratings I called PG Tops and the rest is history. PG himself was very helpful and a private tour was promptly organised. We were picked up from our accommodation in the waterfront area by our guide Deon. Deon treated us to a very special day indeed! We drove out from Cape Town past the stadium and along the water through Sea Point and Clifton and then up the stunning Chapman's Peak drive, before heading down into Simon's Town to see the penguin colony at the Boulders, which we all loved. From there we headed out to Cape Point and then around to the Cape of Good Hope, where we caught the venicular railway to the top of the point for the spectacular views. This was topped off by a late lunch at the Two Oceans restaurant up at the Cape, which was also very good. After lunch we drove back via Constantia wine country which was very nice. The views of the Cape on our drive on a very windy but very clear day were just spectacular. Deon kept the kids and ourselves constantly entertained with story after story - everything about different land marks, through to South African politics and history, health and wellness and everything in between. It was a fantastic conversation! Along the way we had the chance to see penguins, seals, baboons, ostrich and rock rabbits/Dassie. It was a super day and I couldn't speak highly enough of both Deon for being a fantastic guide and PG for turning what started as a frustrating morning into a brilliant day for our family!"

We were able to pin down our preferences and they provided us with the perfect guide for our styles. Bianca got us into Table Mountain early in the morning and the day was spectacular. She was able to help us navigate the area on the waterfront without treating us like children. She answered a thousand questions. The best part was on the second day we decided to leave earlier than planned and she was very accomodating. PG Tops even refunded part of our prepayment due to the way our tour unfolded on day 1 with our spending the afternoon on Robben Island and not with PG Tops, which was something we didn't expect. This type of action was above and beyond what was expected and was the type of service we expereienced from the staff and from our guide. I think that the best way to see a new part of the world is with a private guide and PG Tops was an excellent service. I highly recommend them on your excursion into Capetown. Nancy"

Rudi our guide is a great raconteur and a mine of useful information on the regions we passed through and on South Africa in general, and seems to have been to even more places around the globe than us - including beating us to the North Cape! Anyone who, like Rudi, has been to Easter Island for their birthday just has to trump me and my travel tales! The great thing about driving with just us and Rudi in the car was that we could converse with each other rather than as often happens with larger groups in buses when the guide tends to talk at you rather then with you. PG Tops offer lots more trips and next time we're in South Africa (my youngest daughter was much taken with hearing about our penguin sightings at Boulders Beach so another visit is definitely on the cards!) we will try some more, including to Langa Township.

We stopped at Hout Bay where you can do a little shopping from the vendors that have set up at the harbor. We then went to Cape Point and walked up to the lighthouse. Richard suggested lunch at the restaurant there called Two Oceans. The timing was perfect and it wasn't too crowded. Our lunch was delicious and the views were beautiful. We then went to the Cape of Good Hope and then Boulders Beach Penguin Colony and ending with wine tasting before being dropped off at our hotel. Richard was such a nice and easy going guy.

My initial correspondence and mails was with Thami. He was well informed about the tours and we were able to finalize the tours and deals with him. Here I must say that it is a private guided tour hence it is coming cheap. We reached Capetown and had our tours the next day which to begin was quite disappointing as there was no tour guide at the allocated time i.e. 9am. When contacted we were being given different times which led to a lot of confusion. After all that at 10:30 am the tour guide was there and let me tell you after that all the early morning confusion was just forgotten. Richard the guide who came was excellent, he was just too good in terms of knowledge of the place, very friendly and was ready to go that extra mile just to make us satisfied and happy. We were also visited by the owner of PG tops Peter at the cape of god hope were he was apologetic for the morning mess and also gave a free R500 worth lunch for the mistake and it is rarely that you see such good gestures. Richard even went out of the way and took us to a great farm house restaurant called IMHOFF. The food was not only amazing but it was like one of the bes tlunch we had during our stay in Cape town. All in all this company is god and should you want to book any tours do it without hesitation. I understand that PG tours does take care of their guests and my above report should support my statement."

After having numerous emails with Sofie from Pg Tops, I was prepared to have a great time. I did get a bit concerned when the transport that was arranged to pick us up at the airport didn't show however, after we made it to the hotel, things started looking up. After numerous apologies, they made up for not meeting us at airport, by providing lunch on the tour days. We did the table mountain hike with Frank, who was an excellent guide explaining at every point as we hiked up and back down the mountain. The hike was challenging, but Frank kept a good pace and allowed us to rest when we needed. Then the city tour, the district 6 museum, peninsula tour, Capepoint tour, boulders beach to see the penguins, the botanical gardens with our guide Jarred was most enjoyable. Jarred was very knowledgeable and pleasant. I would not hesitate to recommend Pg Tops to anyone who is travelling to Capetown."

I had originally booked a peninsula tour with PG Tops for our final day in Cape Town, intending to tour Robben Island on our own the day before. But we were dumb and forgot to pre-order our tickets for the Robben Island ferry, and they were sold out when we got to the ticket office. There were still tickets available for the following day (our last in Cape Town), but we had the peninsula tour already booked. I found PG's contact information and got through to Yolanda who immediately set to work trying to accommodate us for a peninsula tour THAT day, instead of as scheduled, so that we could still tour Robben Island before leaving Cape Town. Yolanda connected us with Pieter, and after a couple short phone calls our schedule change was confirmed. Pieter, the founder/owner of PG Tops, couldn't find another driver to take us so last minute, so he changed his personal plans for the day and drove us himself. We were completely blown away by this incredible display of customer service. It was about an hour from the time we placed our initial call to Yolanda, to the time Pieter picked us up at our hotel for our last minute peninsula tour. The tour itself was absolutely perfect. Pieter was a wonderful guide and super knowledgeable. The day was our favorite in Cape Town."

            "review": "Wonderful customized Cape Peninsula tour. I was in Cape Town on a last minute, brief business trip. I had never been to Africa before and would have only one day for any sightseeing, with a 7:30 flight at the end. I am not a group tour sort of person, so I looked for a provider with whom I could book a custom, personal tour that would give me a chance to do a little hiking. I was actually referred to PG Tops by another provider. Nela was fantastic to work with to set up the tour, she was very responsive and had a quote to me within hours, and answered all my miscellaneous questions very promptly and in a very friendly manner. After a rainy few days I was blessed with a clear and sunny Saturday. Jarred Vosges was my tour guide, and he was tremendous and friendly and relaxing to spend the day with. I did not have a lot of time to research the area before my trip, but I learned a lot from Jarred. He has a very nice, low key , conversational style of telling the history of the region and the plants and animals without being preachy or boring at all. He was also very flexible in rearranging the day to fit in things like Table Mountain and Chapman;s Peak Drive , which were closed earlier in the day but open later. I went to Cape Point and did the walks to the lighthouses, and then a point to point hike on the boardwalk to the Cape of Good Hope. I was initially surprised Jarred didn't actually hike with me at Cape Point, but it's not like it is possible to get lost- and after a week of business meals and meetings, I found I really enjoyed the freedom and solitude to go at my own pace. Plus it was great to do the Cape Point to Cape of Good Hope as a point to point. Jarred recommended a side visit to the beach in between, which was great as I had it entirely to myself. We got to do Chapman's Peak drive going north, and we visited the penguins at Boulder Beach. I did have a little problem at Table Mountain, which was the last stop before the airport - a cloud started peeking over right as I ascended and the entire top was in a fog. I couldn't see anything but more importantly, the line to get down (it was 5 PM) was extremely long and I worried about missing my flight. I pled my case, and showed my itinerary to the cable car operator and they let me bypass the line (hate to ask for special treatment but sometimes it's necessary!) . Jarred got me to the airport on time. I had a fantastic day and if I can ever come back and bring my family I know who to go to. I will also point out, though it was not the major part of my decision that the tour price was $100-$200 less than the quotes I received from other companies, who were also much slower in answering."

My husband and I along with our teenage daughter recently took two days of a private tour with PG Tops Travel and Tours and had a fantastic time. Our first day was down to the Cape of Good Hope area, and Rudi our driver was very knowledgeable of the area, and very flexible on timing, accommodating all of our requests. He had pre booked our lunch so we were sure to get in, and was happy to take side trips when we were interested in something special.Our second day trip was to the wine country and we had another fantastic day! Because of weather, Table Mtn. had been closed and this was our last day. Rudi called ahead to see if it would be open, and when it was, he took us there first before heading out to the wineries. He had pre booked three different wineries that were all excellent, and again made a lunch reservation ahead of time. We wanted to spend some extra time in the surrounding towns and he happily accommodated, and knew the area well to give us the history as we went. Both days were amazing, and we saw much more than we would have been able to on a group tour or on our own. I would highly recommend PG Tops travel to anyone visiting Cape Town! Tammy B"

My husband and I along with my parents spent two and a half days in mid-May touring Cape Town with Bianca from PG Tops Tours and had a great time. Prior to our trip, I had been referred to PG Tops by another company who could not accommodate our reservation. I had many emails back and forth with Sophie who was great at making recommendations and listening to what we're interested in doing in order to come up with a great itinerary. Once settled, we paid half via PayPal before our trip and the balance on the last day of the tour. The costs included our private tour with Bianca in a very nice, clean van, as well as all entrance fees along the way. The only thing not included were meals during the outings, but we knew that ahead of time. We went up to Table Mountain and to Lions Head the first day. Bianca was great--she had gone to our inn to pick us up at the prearranged time, but we were running a bit late since we wanted to have lunch after cleaning up from our international flight before our tour. She came to get us at the restaurant and waited while we finished. At Table Mountain and Lions Head she never rushed us--the amount of time we spent or the amount walking was completely up to us...you never felt rushed. The next day we toured the peninsula --- we stopped to feed the ostrich and shop at the ostrich farm, we were lucky to see wild ostrich on the beach on the way to the Cape of Good Hope, visited the Cape of Good Hope, the lighthouse, sat down to eat at the Two Oceans Restaurant, and visited the Penguins at Boulder beach. Again, the day was at ease and at our pace making for a very personal experience. Bianca did what we wanted at our pace--if we wanted to spend and hour walking along the beach to get good pictures of the wild ostrich, no problem; if we wanted to walk or ride up to the lighthouse it was up to us. The final day, PG Tops had arranged a private tour of Kirstenbosch for us with one of their head botanists as my father is a semi-professional gardener. I had tried to contact Kirstenbosch directly as the gardening journals had recommended doing this to get the private tour and access to the non-public greenhouses; however, the garden had never responded directly. PG Tops made it happen. We finished our day with wine tasting and lunch at Constantia. Bianca was great and very enjoyable to spend our tour with. She even had authentic South African license plates made for my husband who collects them from all over the world. All in all, we were very pleased. we didn't make it to the Castle of Good Hope because we spent so much time at the garden, but that was our choice and not our priority and Bianca offered to return the entrance fee for that. We were extremely lucky in that our weather was sunny, clear and beautiful for the most part). If you want personalized tour without being pressured, I highly recommend PG Tops and Bianca. Just communicate your priorities and they will make it happen. Cape Town is great and PG Tops makes it even more enjoyable."

We had started our trip from the U.S. disastrously, missing our nonstop due to mechanical & weather delays. After contacting PG Tops by email they were very accommodating about picking us up at the airport and then picking up the 3rd member of the party who had already arrived. It's a breath-taking view and the stop off at the penguin colony was fun too. Cute but strange sound creatures."

This was our first visit to Cape Town and we planned a few sightseeing days before boarding our cruise ship for the return to the UK.We wanted to make the most of what could well be a \"once in a lifetime\" visit, so we checked carefully through the Trip Advisor reviews and finally chose this company. What a good decision!!!Our local itinerary was as follows:-Day 1 - early morning arrival at CPT. We were met and via a brief orientation tour, taken to our hotel, the Radisson Blu Waterfront, again another excellent choice. We spent the rest of the day walking around the upmarket V&A Waterfront, a great place to unwind and to buy our first souvenirs!Day 2 - Cape Town tour including Table Mountain and Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens.Day 3 - Cape Winelands tour including several wineries and Franschhoek and Stellenbosch, plus an amazing restaurant overlooking the Franschhoek valley for lunch.Day 4 - Cape Peninsula tour to Cape Point including Chapman's Peak Drive.Day 5 - Overburg tour to Herrnanus and one of our favourite locations, the Creation Winery in the Hemel en Aarde Valley (Heaven on Earth), - the name speaks for itself!Day 6 - Sadly the end of our time in Cape Town with a transfer to the port to join our cruise ship. All of these tours had amazing highlights, too many to recount in this short review. Having our own guide meant that we could plan each day, vary timings and our initial schedule, to cater for our individual requirements and as a further example of flexibility, make sure we ascended Table Mountain when the weather was appropriate. Of course we had wonderful views, which may not have been the case if this planning and flexibility were not possible.Throughout our guide was Jarred Vosges. He was superb, polite, punctual, easy to talk to, about pretty well anything and became a \"friend\". We could not think of anything he could have done differently to make this experience match our \"once in a lifetime\" requirement. However we now feel that a return visit, perhaps at a different time of year, must be near the top of our personal \"bucket list\"."

So the night before the tour I finally looked at the confirmation only to see that the date was for the day after what I thought was the tour date. Big issue since I would be a on a plane then. A quick call to PG with an explanation of what was the problem resulted in an email with the right date \u2013 tomorrow. Disappointment averted. Bianca my guide was a life long local with great knowledge of the area. We talked a wide range of topics ranging from baboons to politics to the best spot to find local art. Big fun. In the end it felt like I had hung out with a local friend vs a tour guide. I am a hard grader but I would give five stars."

Had never had a private guided tour before, and were concerned with the expense. It was absolutely worth it! While we had arranged for a Cape Point Tour, Johan took the time to listen to what we had already done on our generic bus tours in Cape Town, and adapted his tour (significantly) to fit our needs, including a detour to the Table Mountain Tram that wasn't anywhere near the original route. He was pleasant, had a wealth of local information, took us \"off the beaten path\" a couple of times to show us some of his favorite spots, took pictures of the two of us in all the right places, and helped my wife identify and photograph essentially every flowering plant between Cape Town and Cape Point. He helped us get restaurant reservations at the Two Ocean Restaurant at Cape Point, and even made great recommendations on what to order. Both the money and the time (from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM) we spent was well worth it!Sofie was a gem. During the weeks and days leading up to our visit I would preliminary schedule and then not get back to her; on several occasions due to other traveling we were doing that limited our access to WiFi. She stuck with us to the end. The day before the tour, I let her know that due to hearing issues, it was essential that we have a guide that spoke English clearly and would take my limitation into account. Even with such short notice (actually less than 24 hours from the time someone would be picking us up) she was able to provide us with Johan, who met our requirements perfectly. I would absolutely without qualification recommend Johan and the good folks at PG Tops Travel to anyone interested in a tour. While it is unlikely we'll ever run into anybody where we live (Mountain states of USA) that will be looking for a guide, we hope we do, so we can make a referral. We would trust our family and our friends with him without any problem.Thanks folks!!!"

On our second day (our wedding anniversary), we toured wineries that she had chosen perfectly to share the great wines, foods, and scenery but also to celebrate our special day.

Pieter and Caren and the whole PG Tops team did an absolutely amazing job of putting together and carrying out a truly memorable trip for our large group. We had only a few days and a long list of activities, plus our group grew very large - the PG Tops team was able to deal with it all. They were available at any time to answer questions and were incredibly knowledgeable. Every detail was taken care of for us, while still being spontaneous and able to accommodate our wishes. I cannot recommend them enough. I sincerely thank Pieter and Caren for the trip of a lifetime, and I can't wait to come back again!"

            "review": "2 fabulous days - Cape Point, Boulders, Langa Township, and Stellenbosch. This was my parents' first trip to Africa and I could think of no one more capable to show them the city of Cape Town than Pieter Geldenhuys of PG Tops. While traveling in South Africa last year with friends, I was introduced to Pieter through a former client who raved about what an amazing time they had. Pieter designed a completely custom city tour based upon our interests and knowledge of the city including my desire to try \"bunny chow\" (it's delicious, by the way). He also charmed the pants off (figuratively, of course) all 4 of us! So, given the short period of time we had to spend in the city pre- and post-safari I immediately thought of PG Tops. Day 1 was focused on mom who was excited to see Cape Point and the penguin colony at Boulders Beach. We also stopped in Hout Bay to see the seals and continued on to Kalk Bay for a bit of shopping. At every step, Pieter gave us options and never seemed to hurry. We couldn't have asked for a better guide or a more fun day. Day 2 began with a township tour led by Odwa. He offered us a unique view of life in an urban township and shared a great deal of his personal struggle growing up in Langa in a poor, single-parent home. His story is one of great hope and courage, and shows just how much South Africa has evolved in the last 20 years. He believes in the idea of South Africa as a \"Rainbow Nation\" and he'll make you believe it too:) After this Pieter collected us to head out to Cheetah Outreach and Somerset West for an amazing lunch at Waterkloof. The wine, food, view and venue were outstanding. I am pretty sure this is heaven on earth. More options were offered after lunch and we chose to continue on to Stellenbosch for a quick drive thru the town and the University, and a tasting at Ken Forrester. It is hard for me to imagine how these days could have been any more pleasant, informative, and seamless. Pieter has an amazing ability to read people and cater to their interests and time constraints. I can't say enough good things about the PG Tops Team."

Bianca told us to take a seat in the clubhouse and have a cold drink, minutes later we had 4 Buggies and my clients where over the moon, she saved my bacon, thank you. ;) Bianca has a knowledge of the Cape that is second to none, full of info and with her friendly and charming art made the site seeing a real pleasure.We will be back again ;) i can't speak highly enough of PG Tops and the Delightful Bianca Smith.Thanks AgainFrancis Burke PGA Professional."

We arrived during the fires on the Cape, and Bianca made all of the necessary adjustments to avoid the fires, get us to Table Mountain on the one day it was clear, and got us through the fires to see the penguins. Bianca arranged a city tour which included a stop at the District 6 museum, great restaurant for lunch, and Table Mountain on one day, a peninsula tour on another day, and a wine tour to Stellenbosch on another day. It was the perfect itinerary for the time we had in Capetown.We can and will recommend PG Tops to our friends going to Capetown and for sure Bianca as their tour guide.

            "review": "First Rate Tour , Fantastic!!. A first rate tour experience in Cape Town with PG Tops Tour & TravelWe are following up on a 4-day private tour booked through PG Tops Tour and Travel company in Cape Town from December 22-26, 2014. There were four of us traveling from Canada. We arrived in Cape Town, after disembarking from a 30-day cruise aboard Nautica with Oceania Cruise Lines.We booked our tour through Bianca at PG Tops. We have nothing but praise for Bianca, the tour company and guides. Everything went so very smoothly, hitting all the highlights we had hoped for and more, as well all the guides were so friendly, courteous and very knowledgeable...Bianca, Jarrett and Rod. Our tour days with PG Tops tour company capped off a wonderful 6-weeks of travel...terrific finale.To highlight some of the many positives that made Bianca and PG Tops tour company a standout in our minds.1. PROMPT RESPONSE: At the outset I'd sent a number of emails to various tour companies in Cape Town that I'd researched online. Initially, I did not have this company's email, however one of the companies I'd initially sent an email to did respond but unfortunately it was booked, however this company did recommend PG Tops as a very good tour company. I followed up this suggestion with a quick email to PG Tops tour company. PG Tops representative, Bianca, responded promptly....very quick considering the time difference. This was before I'd had any response from the remaining companies which I'd emailed days prior. We found this most impressive as this suggested reliability to us. This along with Bianca's friendly, professional style, sold us on this company immediately.2. COMMUNICATIONS: My many communications with Bianca were always very promptly answered, and always addressed my queries and any concerns. Considering the significant time difference between Canada and Cape Town; if I sent an email early in the day I would always have a response by the end of the day. If I sent an email late in the day, there would always be a response very early the following morning. Bianca made many excellent suggestions and followed through on everything, particularly Robben Island tickets which were initially sold-out (late June ) since our time in Cape Town was during the very busy Christmas season. We were very disappointed, however Bianca did keep our hopes alive by saying she would keep track to see if additional ferries would be added to the schedule at a later date. True to her word Bianca followed up and quickly notified us when additional tickets became available. She was able to purchase tickets for Robben Island so we would not be disappointed....pleased us immensely since this was a must-see site while in Cape Town.3. STRATEGIC PLANNING: The order of the tour sites visits was organized by Bianca according to the demands of the busy tourist season/Christmas...earlier morning starts (7:30 am) for Table Mountain and Cape Point. This allowed us to spend adequate, quality time at each site during this busy season, including those times when some venues closed earlier than usual on Christmas Eve. Pick-up was always prompt and on time. The early morning starts were arranged so that we would not be subjected to long lines and throngs of people and tour buses. This was so very much appreciated as it made all the difference and alleviated any frustration. We were always able to move about the venues with ease, and most importantly we were able to get the best photos from all vantage points without waiting and jostling among numerous other avid photographers. Also, Bianca was very astute with an excellent memory. At some point during our communications I\u2019d mentioned that we were avid golfers. Keeping this in mind she planned our final stop on the Winelands day tour a visit to Ernie Els winery in Stellenbosch. It was a highlight; the wine tasting itself was a wonderful, sophisticated experience.....tasting 4 generous fine wine samples sipped while relaxing in comfortable chairs under large sun umbrellas overlooking the beautiful vineyard dotted valley of Stellenbosch. As a bonus we had the opportunity to view Ernie\u2019s trophy room and to purchase monogrammed souvenir golf shirts, caps and ball markers. 5. PROVIDING TOTAL EXPERIENCE: Efforts were always made to have us experience as many sites as possible, i.e. The Noon Gun, Bo-Kapp, City Tour, which we had thought we would not get to see owing to our limited time and busy schedule of sites. The tour schedule set up allowed us to see all the major sites plus these additional ones which were a welcome bonus for us. As well, Bianca was so thoughtful in arranging lunches at lovely restaurants which served excellent food in the most beautiful locations.6. VEHICLES: The vehicle/van in which we toured was clean, comfortable, spacious and new....a white Mercedes van. This adds to the experience and impression that this company is dedicated to provide comfort, reliability and an overall quality experience.7. OUTSTANDING GUIDES: Bianca, Jarrett, and Rod were all very friendly, knowledgeable and truly seemed to enjoy their jobs and were happy to be guiding us about. (Note: our day with Jarrett was a different type of tour day; Robben Island and Table Mountain, however he provided us with an excellent experience as well.) Bianca was so energetic and enthusiastic, making our 2 days to the Winelands and Cape Point, breathtaking, informative, very memorable and so much fun. Rod was very knowledgeable and his suggestion to drive to Hermanus was a bonus on Christmas Day when we didn't know what to do prior to our drop-off at the airport in the early evening. As well, we were very impressed with Rod\u2019s caring nature. When Rod dropped us off, he remained with us at the airport to ensure that we had our tickets, boarding passes, luggage checked and all things completed for our departure and journey home....a relief for us. He provided so much interesting background to the areas during our drive and went out of his way to ensure that we did do everything possible, including washroom breaks and coffee stops, even though much was closed, this being Christmas Day. Overall, we were so fortunate to have had the highest quality tour experience provided by Bianca and PG Tops Tour and Travel Company. We had a fantastic time and will be recommending Bianca and PG Tops to anyone who might plan to travel to Cape Town.Thank you so much to Bianca and PG Tops for a wonderful tour experience in Cape Town."

            "review": "Over priced/under delivered. I had arrived in Cape Town four days early to join a land tour; decided to put three of those days to best use by contracting PG Tops. Caren, from the office, was delightful in the arrangements. 1. I had heard stellar reviews on Stellenbosch and, as a wine enthusiast, was looking forward to the experience in the Winelands Tour. Unfortunately, Bianca told me that we would end up in the middle of the rush hour and was not worth it so I agreed in order to keep her within the schedule. Consequently I was dropped at the hotel half an hour early with nothing left to do. Could we have included the area at least if not the wines?2. I have developed a love for penguins in the Antarctic and thus my highlight for the Cape Point tour was to visit them in their habitat. We went to a lookout point which was nice but from a distance. I was told by people in my land tour later that the penguins walk right up to you on the beach was shown some awesome pictures. Why wasn\u2019t I given this option?3. The same day we went to lunch after climbing to the lighthouse. The place was expensive so I ordered the most reasonable item I could find on the menu for about US$10. I was impressed that she ordered an item for US$16. plus a latte assuming that the tour company was very generous with her allowance. I was jealous because her dish looked fantastic - until the bill arrived - and she made no effort to cover her meal. When I asked whether I was supposed to pay, Bianca replied coyly that if I wanted to... So I did. This backfired for her because I had already made a mental note about her tip which, as a typical North American, was going to be over the top. So, that night I did research on the internet and in the hotel and found out that in South Africa you tip R100 for a full day and R50 for a half day. Basically she ate two days\u2019 work of tips and I saved a significant amount of money.4. On the half day City tour we went to Table Mountain. Bianca seemed to be in a bad mood and left me running after her in her dust following her up to the cable car. Being a senior and having difficulty breathing in the extreme heat of the day, I was extremely uncomfortable and frustrated but kept my thoughts to myself to avoid confrontation. We went to another view point and to the Company Gardens. The latter is a total waste of time. Then she dropped me half an hour early at my hotel. Having passed on the museum and the Castle of Good Hope and its entrance fees which were saved by the tour company, I asked if I wouldn\u2019t get a glimpse of the city. Bianca again said that the traffic was bad. I then asked if I could at least get a peek at the Bo-Kaap area. Bianca asked gruffly, so do you want me to take you there at which point I told her to forget it. She then started the car again and took me grudgingly to one street in the Bo-Kaap area. I took a picture and returned to the hotel which was very near.5. At this point I told her how I felt about the lunch the day before. Bianca said defensively that guests usually pay. My response was that I should have been notified by the PG Tops of the expected additional cost of a luxury lunch for the guide to be included in my budget. I had never encountered this in the past anywhere else.6. I did take the Hop-On-Hop Off the next day for the City, Constancia, and the Botanical Gardens on my own on the following day. I regret that I didn\u2019t do so from the very beginning instead of the overpriced City Tour.I have to ask, if there where to occasions when traffic was an obstacle why time wasn\u2019t better managed by those in the know by reversing the schedule. Why is it that a guest is imposed with a meal that has not been accounted for? Why am I left to walk behind the guide?"

I travel a lot for business, and had never thought about looking into a tour company, but on my recent trip to Cape Town, when I would have two extra days before departing, I decided to give it a try. I wasn't going to rent a car, so how else could I see some of this part of the world that I had never been to before? I had my doubts, but Rudi put them to rest right off the bat. I sat in the front seat and he made me feel like I was just visiting a (very knowledgeable) local friend, showing me around the area. Rudi let me decide how long I wanted to spend shopping with the local vendors, or stopping for photos, or hiking. He answered all my questions, and if he didn't know the answer (like the latitude of Cape Town) he looked it up on his smart phone. I doubt I will be back to South Africa, but I will definitely recommend PG Tops tours to any friends or colleagues who will be visiting Cape Town. Rudi really made it feel like my visit was complete! (He even helped me find a Laundromat once we got back to the area of my hotel!)"

We booked a day trip to the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point along with a day safari to Aquila Game Reserve. Working with Barbara to book the 2 trips was a charm. She responded promptly to all our questions and offered services we didn\u2019t even request. Aquila does not confirm pick up times until the evening prior and we had no cell service in Cape Town. Barbara followed up with Aquila the evening before (outside of her working hours) and emailed us with the pick-up times. This type of customer service is what makes a company great!Our trip to the Cape of Good Hope was with a private guide, Andrew. He was prompt in picking us up and was a wealth of information on the Cape Town area and South Africa in general. It was so interesting spending the day with him. Our \u201cschedule\u201d for the day was very flexible and we were able to spend as much, or little, time at each stop as we chose. The Aquila trip was an amazing experience. It\u2019s a small park but that offers the opportunity to see many animals. The staff is friendly and the 2 meals we had there, breakfast and lunch, were wonderful. So, if you\u2019re having difficulty deciding on which tour company to use, look no further. You can\u2019t go wrong with PG Tops."

            "review": "Great Way to See the Cape Town Area. My wife and I had three days to see Cape Town and vicinity. One can easily spend another several days there so we wanted to make the best use of our time. Moreover, it was high season during the Christmas holidays, which meant we would need to work our way among many other tourists. Therefore, we opted for a private, day-long Cape Peninsula tour and chose PG Tops due to its high TripAdvisor rating.Reserving a place with PG Tops through Barbara Wild was easy. Our guide, Andrew Penn, who was subcontracting to PG Tops, was superb. He was timely to our downtown hotel at 7:30 am. He wisely got us started early because the Cape of Good Hope park becomes crowded. We headed right to the Cape, arrived at the park entrance with a short queue of three cars ahead of us, then viewed the lighthouse and the several capes there including the Cape of Good Hope. In later morning we headed to Seaforth Restaurant in Simon's Town for an excellent meal on the deck and then viewed the penguins at Boulders Beach. Andrew then drove us over Chapman's Peak Drive to Constantia Glen Winery, a good choice with a wonderful view from the verandah. From there we returned to our hotel between 5 and 6 pm.It was a full day and Andrew ensured it was a productive one. He expertly steered us away from traffic. For example, when we left the park around 11 am, the queue to enter the park probably stretched for a quarter mile or more Just as importantly, Andrew, as a native of Cape Town, knew the city and vicinity intimately. He provided us with historical, natural, political, cultural and other information, and he was able to answer our many questions over the course of the day. Moreover, he was a delightful companion over lunch and at the winery.Based on our very positive experience, I recommend both PG Tops and Andrew."

The information given was first class & as good as you get anywhere if not better. The tours were loaded with interest & for a stranger to Cape Town we certainly got full value. The trip to the District Six Museum & Robben Island was extremely informativeThe second tour by Yolande was excellent with a vast amount of knowledge of the area given to keep us well informed. We were introduced to all of the major points of interest around CT & the Point to which we are extremely grateful. It is certainly a pleasure to have been shown around by two fantastic tour guidesTo be picked up & dropped off at your door step was a cherry on top of the cake since to drive into an unknown part of the city would have immediately stressed us out which would no doubt have dulled our experience. The final point is that by having done the two organised trips, our lay out of the area was enhanced to such an extent that made our own ventures very easy to follow by having been given a heads up on routes to followWell done to Bianca & Yolande plus all of the background staff for having arranged the tripsCheersD A RAMSAY"

            "review": "Great Solo Private Tour. A couple months ago (end of October) I traveled solo to Cape Town for 4 nights. As a traveler that generally hates group tours, I was looking for a company that offered private tours for a solo traveler. Cape Town is not like European cities where there is a large infrastructure for public transportation, especially to the peninsula areas of the cape. So I wanted someone to take me around for the day that would hit some key places I wanted to go to such as Cape Point and Boulders Colony, but also show me some off the beaten path stuff. The company I had booked a wine tour through for a separate day actually recommended PG Tops to me for booking a private tour. I reached out and Sofie was quick to respond with a wealth of information. She was great in giving me options and setting up my tour! Pieter was my tour guide for the day, which was surprising as he's the owner of the company. I felt a little bad he was stuck with just me for the day but he was great and extremely knowledgeable! He offered up more recommendations, discussed how I like to travel and took me to a great whole in the wall place with tasty samosas on the way to our other destinations. Pieter was spot on for timing (getting to places before the crowds landed) also did a good balancing act of showing me around while also giving me space to venture out on my own at times. Oh, and he also has a great soundtrack in the car. We ended the tour with Wilson Phillips, Release Me. How awesome is that?! Thanks to team PG Tops for a great day!"

We wrote PG Tops and asked if they could help us out with the things we wanted to do/see (Cape Peninsula, City tour which also included Langa Township and Table Mountain, and the wine country). From the first e-mail reply, we had the feeling that this was a greaet company with a high service level and fair prices .When we told them we wanted to do Robben island on \"our own day\" in the city, they offered to buy the tickets, so we wouldn't have to deal with that - I know it's a minor thing, but I really enjoy those small details.We had Rudi as our guide for the Cape Peninsula and the city tour - he was very pleasent company, and was very well informed about everything. He made our days very flexible, helping make sure we got the most out of it. One of the other \"small details\" they had arranged, was a booked table at the nice restaurant at Cape Point - a very nice place to enjoy lunch.Peter was our guide on the wine tour, which also was both funny and informative. None of us had any wine knowledge - we primary went on this tour for the beauty of the countryside (and it really is beautiful), but Peter shared all his wine-tasting knowledge (in very entertaining ways), and brought us to some interesting places. He had also picked a great restaurant for our lunch, and helped us book a table for dinner as well (at a restaurant he recommended after he had learned what kind of food we were looking for) - again minor details that just added to the whole experience.We had 4 great days in Cape Town - and 3 of them were with great help from PG Tours. If ever in Cape Town, I'm sure I'll contact them again, to help me go experience some of the things we didn't have time to do during this visit.The service were excellent in all aspects, and we all agreed that the guides were really good as well - we felt very comfortable and well taken care of, so all in all, I highly recommend contacting PG Tours and let them help you get the most out of your Cape Town visit."

My choice out of my research was Clive's but he was booked and he referred me to PG Tops. I did some research on their reviews and the offers. Pretty much everyone offers the same and there were a lot of reviews of every tour company that sounded like all tour companies in Cape Town are the best yet all the tours were sort of packaged deals that everyone did. Long and short of it we did 3 days of day tours, Wine Country, Cape Peninsula, and Cape Town City tour. The only one that I would recommend for a private tour would be Cape Peninsula the other two I recommend a small group and you will save some money and probably make new friends. Bianca was very pleasant to spend the 3 days with and I believe she will make a great tour guide. I will rate each day tour individually."

My husband and I were in Cape Town for the first leg of our honeymoon and as we were not hiring a car we wanted to do a day trip to the winelands and to the Cape Penninsula, so before we left we booked two trips with PG Tops. We booked two private tours for each of the trips and both itineraries sounded amazing. Our guide Jamie was just fantastic. Knowledgeable, friendly, funny and reliable both of our trips were highlights of our honeymoon. Our first day trip was to the winelands. Jame picked us up at 8.30am and we drove to Stellanbosch, along the way she filled is in on landmarks, townships and any other points of interest without ever bombarding us. nd the beauty of it being a private tour was that we could really do what we wanted and didnt have to fit in with anyone elses schedule. At Stellanbosch we got about an hour to look around and then we headed to our first winery. We then drove on to a second one near Paarl, and then drove to Franschoek where we stopped for a browse and a lovely lunch. Jamie even filled us in on where not to eat after some of her previous guests got food poisoning in one particular cafe there! Then we went to one more winery where they did wine and cheese which was a real find and our favourtie visit of the trip. It was a wonderful day we thoroughly enjoyed. The second trip was to Cape Penninsula and again Jamie picked us up early and we made a couple of stops to some really cute little towns along the way before going to the Peninsula. It was a really windy day, so it was hard to see the difference between the two oceans, but none the less it was a great experience and Jamie was wonderful taking pictures for us and telling us about all the widllife in the park. We had lunch at the two oceans restaurant, while the food was good the service was very peculiar so I wouldn't recommend it but that was nothing to do with Jamie or PG Tops.If you are going to Cape Town and looking for a private tour I couldn't recommend Jamie and PG Tops highly enough it was really wonderful."

Both guides were good company and informative.Both trips focused on wildlife, as we had said that was one of main interests. So we saw penguins at both Betty's Bay and Boulder's Beach. The whale boat was run by Dyer Island Cruises and we got really close to some whales, as well as seeing some seals at Dyer Island. Because the sea was a bit choppy, the trip took longer than expected, and we only just got to Betty's Bay before it closed. If the weather is a bit rough, I'd recommend asking for seasickness tablets, as one or two people were sick. The Peninsula trip was really pleasant, but watch out for baboons at Cape Point, especially if your are female and carrying food.All the organisation went really smoothly, so I am happy to recommend PG Tops for these personalise tours."

All of the people we dealt with were very nice and helpful, and the day with the Sharks was incredible - it was also nice that Bianca explained all of the areas we passed through for the journey to the Sharks.We are already planning a longer holiday next year and will going with PG Tops for Sharks again, their excellent looking Safari's and anything else we decide on.Alex & Family."

I set up the details with Caren who was very responsive to all the questions I had and I had a lot! Our driver was waiting for us when we arrived at the airport and our transfer to the hotel went well.Our full-day tour was scheduled for Robben Island in the morning and the Winelands in the afternoon. PG Tops\u2019 driver, Bianca, picked us up at the hotel on time. There were four of us and we were very comfortable in the van. Bianca brought us to the pier for the ferry to Robben Island and purchased our tickets for us. Unfortunately, the ferry was cancelled after we boarded so we called PG Tops and our driver came back for us. Bianca had several suggestions as to how to spend the morning and we opted for a visit to the District Six museum before going to the Winelands which was no problem for Bianca. She even made a quick stop at a pharmacy for us. We then picked up our guide (and owner), Peter, who was fantastic. He is a walking encyclopedia on the history of South Africa as well as more current affairs and on wines of the region. His selection of wineries for our tasting tour and lunch was excellent.We would not hesitate to use PG Tops again. They were flexible with our arrangements and their service and tour content was excellent."

Rudi was most professional, knowledgeable and most of all personable. It was like touring with a family member. The first day we toured the town and Table Mountain. The second day we drove to Cape of Good Hope, and the last day we toured the wine country with a side shopping trip. Rudi made wonderful lunch and dinner recommendations and all were exceptional. PG Tops made our Cape Town visit memorable and stress free. We would highly recommend PG Tops."

It is simply her personality. The result was we got a sense of the history and evolution of Cape Town and its culture from a real local, whose first language was Afrikaans. We saw the peninsula, Signal Mountain, downtown, the penguins, with someone who was honest about shortcomings of the area, but had an undeniable love for the area and country. If one wants to mix fun with a tour, and end up with a real sense of the area, Yolanda and her company will be a great bet. And this from a couple of seniors!"

She was punctual, pleasant, attentive and knew all that needed to be known as a tourist guide.She also knew the best restaurants at every place we visited. She was a great conversationalist too.....We made it to all the sites on time as per the visiting hours. Our tours were a little cramped up I believe, but we managed to cover it all.Thank you PG Tops and especially Nicolene for a wonderful three days.

Deion heard that and picked out some excellent wineries where we had private tastings. Rudy was a terrific guide of the Cape and as the day dawned with perfect weather, he said we should begin with the cable car ride up to Table Mountain and we were so glad we did! Both guides gave us great insight to South Africa and were excellent companions for the day! And a special shout out to Sofie in the office who organized everything beautifully, Thank You!"

Thank you Sofie!We spent 2 days with Yolanda for a Peninsula Tour and Winelands Tour. She is young fun and very nice to answer all of our questions. We had never done private tours before and were worried it would feel 'strange' but Yolanda is so open and nice and we could do whatever we wanted! We had reservations to paraglide and due to weather it was questionable; so yolanda even picked us up early and switched days around for us due to Robben Island cancellation and Paragliding weather. Thank You Yolanda!We spent a day with Godfrey at his home of Langa Township. This is a tour where you want Godfrey. He grew up there and still lives there; so you definitely get a personal insight to the townships. This is a very different tour than others; more of a cultural tour and not the popular tourists sites of Cape Town.Overall PG Tops was GREAT in helping us organize our 4 days in Cape Town. Yolanda had some recommendations for restaurants, shopping, and truly personalized our days. Sofie and Bianca's organization on the front end was SOO very helpful!

We visited Stellenbosch and the winelands in close proximity with Pieter, and then Capetown and the southern area included yet another vineyard with Erica - not that I was complaining !! Both trips were relaxed and informative, aided by discussions of our own views and feelings on the general state of affairs of the country which I was interested in having lived in Zambia some years ago. I can honestly say I found Pieter and Erica very easy to talk to and they maintained a relaxed but professional attitude throughout. I felt it was worth paying the extra against a bigger tour company for the simple reason we're not going to be visiting the area in the near future so make the most of it with the personal service."

We enjoyed his company and learned quite bit about Cape Town and South Africa. He was also very brave in scaring away a baboon that opened the car door in search of food when the rest of us was distracted by taking photos of ostrich."

We spent three days with Roelef who was an amazing tour guide - incredibly knowledgeable and attentive. He listened to everything we said and spontaneously designed activities that suited our needs. We saw the city, Kirstenbosch, Cape of Good Hope, the wine country, and everything in between. We learned so much about Cape Town and Roelef was able to show us all the amazing viewpoints that the city has to offer. The company is incredibly flexible and has a very relaxed yet professional attitude. I would highly recommend their services!"

It was the first time my wife and I had booked a private tour. We normally either drive or go on group excursions -but having read the previous reviews on trip advisor decided to give it a try and our time in Cape Town was so much better as a result. We booked two full day tours - the Cape Peninsular and Cape Town City Tour which included Table Mountain. Our tour guide for both was Roelf who was excellent - very interesting, knowledgeable and friendly, it was a real pleasure to meet him.Both tours were excellent. We got to learn so much about the Cape Town area. The tours are flexible and paced to your own choosing, Roelf even managed to fit in a bit of wine tasting for us at the end of one day. The Peninsular Tour is a great trip with a fabulous coastline. Without having to drive you can really take it in and still be able to stop where you choose. The tour of Cape Town included a walk around the City centre (the main City centre is not that big so it was not a big trek). This was a really fun option and it was really enjoyable to able to walk around and get to understand so much about what you are visiting. Thank you to PG Tops for a fantastic time."

Our guide Rudi was a very nice chap and tried his best to listen to our interests and choose the winery's accordingly.We went to Fairview first, which is commercially run, and at the slightly cheaper end of the market. You can taste goats cheese as well, which was very good. A popular wine in the UK, Goats do Roam, is produced here. The grounds are nice, complete with goats, and the staff were helpful and knowledgeable.As particular red wine lovers, we went next to Rust En Vrede, which I don't think is a usual stop on the tour. The wine was more expensive, but really very nice. They have a restaurant there which looked inviting, but we were already booked to eat elsewhere.For lunch we went to the Graff estate. The restaurant has fantastic views, but we thought the attitude of the staff was a bit snotty. Finally we went to the Warwick estate, but we were not keen on their wine, and the service was very poor.We did buy wine at 3 of the estates to be shipped back to the UK. Its worth noting that there is a huge variance in how efficient each estate is in making this transaction straightforward (or not). We would have expected the process to be streamline !If you are considering a wine tour, it is well worth doing research in advance to identify which specific winery's may be to your taste. There's a huge variety.Our second tour was the following day when we went horse riding on the beach at Noordhoek. This was just something I wanted to do having seen horses on the beach during our last visit to Cape Town. The beach and sea are beautiful and deserted, so a lovely way to spend a morning. Our driver, Joe was very pleasant, although I'm not sure it was necessary, as he just spent 5 hours in the car waiting for us.All communication with PG Tops was dealt with very efficiently by Sofie - thank you :-)"

If I'd wanted to choose African Eagle, I could have booked it with them myself! I specifically chose PG Tops because of their high ranking on TripAdvisor, and African Eagle had a much lower ranking on TripAdvisor. Needless to say, I was not surprised when the tour turned out to be mediocre (eg. the pick up was 1 hour late, our tour guide kept disappearing and handing us off to other people during the tour).If I had to do it again, I would not choose PG Tops or African Eagle."

They have great vehicles, are very accommodating and will taylor your day to what you really want to do. We did a full day trip to the Cape of Good Hope, then another full day touring the city and then out to the wine country. They keep you safe, informed and guide you through such things as the best places to curio shop and what is customary for tipping at restaurants. We had a wonderful experience and would choose them again."

Although I've never used a tour company on any of our travels, I decided it was best to hire someone for this trip. It was the best thing I could have done, and I really think I found the best tour guide for the job. Yolanda was fantastic! She is young, vibrant, and excited to share all she knows about the area and the country with her guests. The best part for me was she had spent a year as an au pair in the past, so she really got kids- was able to talk with them and explain things to them in a way that they understood and found exciting. I feel like the boys learned a lot, and I did too! She was able to make it interesting for all of us. In talking with her it seems she could really tailor make a tour that anyone, young or old, with any interests, could be very happy with. She loves her job and it really shows. It was a whirlwind three days, in which we saw cheetahs, whales, seals, penguins, ostriches, along with any other wild life that crossed our paths. We hiked Lion's Head (definitely a highlight), walked from Cape Point to the Cape of Good Hope (beautiful!) and went blokarting. We had a fantastic city tour and really loved the castle portion especially. We were also able to drive around much of the area and take in some really incredible scenery. I cannot say enough good about Yolanda and the company. They were very easy to work with, reasonably priced, and provided three great days for us! She made traveling with three kids super easy- I didn't have to think about where we were going or what to see, or where we were going to eat. All the information she was able share with us really enhanced our experience in Cape Town. Would recommend to anyone."

I started with an email and corresponded with Bianca, who was very responsive and informative. After several rounds of emails, we finally settled on an itinerary two days of touring in and around Cape Town. For my husband and me, our must-sees were Table Mountain (husband) and Robben Island (me). I also wanted to get a sense of the city and go out to the winelands.Rudi picked us up on time on a morning with terrible weather. Table Mtn was a no-go that morning, and I wasn't due to go to Robben Island until the afternoon. So Rudi improvised and took us through the Waterfront where we did a little shopping and then brought us to Camp's Bay so we could see the other side of the mountain. Ultimately we had some lunch before I was due to catch the ferry to Robben Island, and then he would whisk my husband up the mountain, so he could get that in. My husband tells me that Rudi actually waited to see me board the ferry before they left for the mountain. When I returned from Robben Island, Rudi was waiting for me just as planned.Due to a scheduling change, my husband could not join in for any of our 2nd day of touring, so Rudi had the dubious honor of being my personal guide for the day. He walked me through the Castle of Good Hope and then drove me out to the winelands. He was such a trooper watching me taste wines all day. I had a fabulous day and much of that is due to his professionalism, great information and good humor. I would strongly recommend that anyone looking for a personal and custom tour of Cape Town and its surrounding areas to contact PG Tops. You will not be disappointed. I hope we'll be back to South Africa again, and they'll be tops on my list."

What amazed me most about my PG experience was that he was able to create a super-unique experience that I know I wouldn't be able to create for myself. I told Pieter that I wanted to do some bike riding, preferably at Cape Point. I realize now that biking up Cape Point would be silly / impossible... but Pieter figured out a way to accommodate my love for biking in an unbelievable way. He used his contact network to create a biking experience for us on Chapman's Peak, a super scenic windy road hugging the mountainous cliffs of Cape Town. For anyone who's been to South Africa, you probably know that Chapman's Peak is an amazing drive. Now imagine that same experience, except you're on a bike! It was incredible and it took my breath away. The entire time, Pieter and his bike rental contact made sure that we were safe, and we were able to do something that probably <1% of tourists do. (In case you're wondering - there aren't bike rental shops around this location - he had to get these bikes brought in!). It was the favorite activity BY FAR for everyone in my travel group - he made me look like a trip planning genius!Beyond all this - Pieter's awesome for the depth of knowledge regarding his country. He walked us through South Africa's history, patiently entertaining my very curious and inquisitive travel group. (We had millions of questions!). You can have a standard tour experience with other vendors, but you really get more with PG. Totally recommend! :-)"

The best thing was that he was completely flexible and open to changing plans according to whatever we felt like seeing (as long as it wasn't ladybugs, Roelf is scared of them :) Don't miss the hike up Lion's Head, the winelands tour, and the Cape Tour. Our last day in Cape Town Godfrey took us on the Township tour. As spectacular as the Cape Town and environs tours were, the Township tour was equally moving and should not be missed. Godfrey was very sensitive to our nervousness that we didn't want to bee seen as gawkers, but rather that we wanted to learn about the townships, how they came about, and how they are evolving. He took us to his home and neighborhood and we thank him for that."

Her energy and enthusiasm kept us upbeat and anxious for the next turn in the road. She showed us the Cape Point area on a gloomy, rainy day, but it did not seem that way to us.

            "review": "Thank you PG tops for an amazing experience!. Just got back from South Africa and loved our time in Cape Town. I think Cape Town on its own is an exceptional place and we would've loved our time anyway, but having great guides to accompany us to the different sites was definitely a bonus I did not expect. Our guides from PG Tops were absolutely AWESOME--not only are they were well informed about the places we visited, but they were very personable and friendly. One huge difference I noticed from guides i've had in the past is that they are not just trying to get their shift done and wanting to get their time with us out of the way; they were hospitable and let us have our time at all the places we visited so that we could appreciate each spot they took us to. We didn't feel rushed once. Me and a group of 5 other girlfriends spent 4 1/2 days in Cape Town; 4 of which we used PG Tops to guide us. Day 1 - Our guide, Godfrey, met us at our hotel and we started the day driving through District 6 and visiting Langa township. We spent about 3-4 hours within the township touring a home shared by 3 families, visiting a preschool, and visiting a local bar within the area. Living in the township himself, we felt we got a better idea of the life there and appreciated that. It was as if someone was inviting us into their home so that we could have a glimpse of the life there. We were supposed to go to Table Mountain on this day also, but because of the rain, it was closed. Godfrey improvised by showing us some other sites in Cape Town and more than made up for our missing Table Mountain that day. He was great. Day 2 - For the rest of our Cape tours, Roelof guided us, and he was wonderful. I was amazed by his people skills and knowledge being as young as he is. We spent this day doing the Cape Peninsula tour. The Cape seaside is one of the most picturesque coastal areas i've ever seen. We spent the whole day stopping along all the different points, from Cape of Good Hope to Capepoint to Boulder beach in Simon's town. Day 3 - Shark diving. We arranged our shark cage diving through PG Tops who works with Marine Dynamics. It's about a 2-3 hour drive from Cape to Gaanesbai but we thought it was well worth it. Well maybe 2 of the 5 ppl I travelled with didn't think so, as they got seasick and didn't feel up to doing the actual dive. I'll write about Marine Dynamics and the dive on another review, but they were great. Day 4 - Robben Island and the wine country in the afternoon. Because it was rainy or didn't fit into our schedule the other 3 days, Roelof got us to Table Mountain on this morning. It was foggy but as it's one of the top sites there, glad we were able to go up. From here, he took us to the port for Robben Island. That was a great visit. He dropped us off at the port and met back with us when we arrived back. Roelof gave us time to grab a bite and shop around the waterfront, and then it was a mad dash to the wine country. Unfortunately, we didn't get to go to Stellbosch which was the plan. Most of the places stop doing tastings at about 5, and because we spent a little more time shopping and made the stop at Table Mountain, we wouldn't have gotten there on time. However, Roelof did a great job of improvising and getting us to a nice spot in Paarl. 4 of the 6 of us don't drink, and when I let Roelof know this earlier in the day, while 2 of us tried the wine, he set it up so the the other 4 could have a \"chocolate\" tasting which they seemed to enjoy. He was also going to take us to cheese tasting spot, but because we wouldn't have gotten there on time as we were already tasting our chocolate and wine, he surprised us with cheese after our tastings, that he rushed to get at some point while we were doing our tastings. It was a perfect end. We reached Cape in the evening and one of the girls wanted to drive by Camp's Bay. I didn't think we had time and thought it was definitely way past the time he needed to spend with us, but he was so accommodating that he said he could drive by there and he did. At the end of our trip we were sad to say goodbye to him, it was as if we had another friend spending those days with us. I have travelled quite a bit, mostly visiting sites w/o guides, but of all the guided tours i've had in the past, this surpassed my expectations. I will definitely recommend PG Tops to anyone I know visiting South Africa in the future."

We decided on a private tour guide due to all the conflicting reports on how dangerous [or not] Cape Town is. Let me firstly say that we had no trouble in Cape Town, or anywhere else during our visit to South Africa. It is no more or less dangerous than most other destinations.  Right from the start we knew we had made the right decision in our choice of tour guides. Yolanda is bubbly, friendly and a wealth of knowledge on Cape Town and South Africa. We got a great feel for the country ,the people and the history. Yolanda could not do enough to make our trip enjoyable and gave us advice on restaurants, shopping and other travel destinations apart from Cape Town. A self confessed \" Cape Town Snob\" Yolanda showed us a side of the city we never would have seen on our own. And the township tour she organised for us with Godfrey was my daughters highlight. This is a must for anyone visiting South Africa and Godfrey, a resident of Langa Township himself,really knows his stuff. So if you are considering a trip to Cape Town I highly recommend the team at PG Tops, they will really ensure you thoroughly enjoy your South African adventure."

Working with Betsy (BJAdventures) and Pieter of PGTops, my daughter Agatha and I had an absolutely wonderful time on the peninsula. We were so lucky to have Pieter as our guide for 3 full days - which spanned hiking and rock climbing to the top of Lion's Head to a spectacular tour of the Cape of Good Hope to great wine/beer and chocolate tastings in the Winelands and beautiful Stellenbosch and of course....time with the Cheetahs, a particular favorite for Agatha.Important to me is having a guide who understands and respects his/her traveling clients and works with me to fulfill our greatest expectations. Pieter excelled at understanding our interests and abilities, was flexible to altering plans, if desired--while always being on time. Being a history buff, I especially appreciated the many discussions we had regarding the history of Cape Town - its people, its culture and its role in modern day society, globally and nationally. Thanks Pieter...and thanks to my dear friend and travel advisor - Betsy (BJAdventures). Paulette (and Agatha)"

Yo collected us at our hotel in an impeccably clean BMW and from that point on, we were in perfect company. Yo is versed in everything-Cape Town, but she wanted input and questions from us from the start of the tour, and we obliged. She handled everything in stride, made side diversions when asked, and even set us about on a 45 minute hike of Cape Point/Cape of Good Hope. There's no BS with Yolanda. She is a straight-at-you, lets have a good time, talk politics/economics/religion/sports kind of gal, and all in all is pretty awesome. Actually, the entire PG Tops group is an absolute pleasure to deal with. I booked the tour direct with PG Tops and stayed in regular communication with Pieter straight through the tour of Cape Point, and even through his recommendations for dinner and wineries. Absolutely recommended without reservation - you cannot go wrong with PG Tops."

Our tour guide Roelof, aside from being knowledgeable, also paid close attention to our questions and comments during the tour...though it was outside the scope of our itinerary, he made sure we got to try \"Biltong\", secured a booking for us at a sought after seafood restaurant, introduced us to Afrikaans music, and got us special souvenirs at the end of the tour. We felt that we were given a unique Cape Town experience truly tailored to our preferences. For that, thank you very much Roelof and PG Tops! :)"

Rolf collected my mother and I in an impeccably clean BMW, what a treat and whisked us up to Table Top Mountain for the first cable car at 8.00 am. We were lucky to have a beautifully clear day. What a view, it was very fresh, my mother thought chilly, so make sure you wear layers and take a scarf.We then set off to Stellenbosch to visit the wineries Ernie Els gets a big tick, lunch at Delaire Graff gets a big tick and the tasting at Rustenberg, although the wines were delicious, particularly their Cabernet, the service was not a patch on the Ernie Els experience. This was a recommendation from PG Tops and an experience not to be missed. We wished we'd had time to return for their cheese platter in the late afternoon paired with their delicious Shiraz or Big Easy Bordeaux blend - next time! What was nice about the tour was it was designed for 'us', compared to being in a large group getting on and off a shuttle bus or SUV. If we wanted to stay longer somewhere, or stop along the way we could. Rolf our driver was telling us, that the onwer, Pieter's philosophy is to provide the guests with a memorable experience, in order to do that Rolf called himself a 'knowledgeable driver', he knew the answers to most of our questions, and pointed out sites along the way.It was a long day for us from 7.30 am to 6.00 pm, and although we didn't have the time to spend walking the streets of Franschoek at the end of our day, Rolf made sure he drove past the sites and pointed things out for us to experience next time.Pieter and Rolf, thank you, as you know I have already recommended you to friends who have also toured with you in Apirl, and they are also recommending you to their friends.So, until we meet again.Thank you.Michelle & SonjaMargaret River & Mandurah (Western Australia)Travelled April 2013"

My husband and I recently spent 2 wonderful days with Roelf in Capetown doing a winelands tour and the Cape Point tour and couldn't have been happier with PG Tops. From the get go, Pieter was a huge help in assisting us with planning our SA honeymoon and Roelf was an excellent tour guide, giving us a very special experience. The winelands tour was great and he even surprised us with a bonus chocolate tasting and beer tasting. We had an incredible picnic lunch at Hartenberg, which remains one of the top highlights of our honeymoon and great wine tastings at Warwick, Fairview and Grande Provence. The Cape Point tour was excellent and Roelf again provided us with a very personal, comfortable and fun day exploring the small fishing villages along the route to the Cape Point, the penguins at Boulders Beach and sending us on our way for a fun hike to the point, where he met us at the top with some much needed water bottles. :)After two amazing days, we decided to add on a township tour with Godfrey who was another great tour guide. Incredibly knowledgable about the history of Capetown and the Langa township that we visited. A HUGE thank you to PG Tops for giving us such memorable experiences in your beautiful city. We would recommend PG Tops to anyone traveling to Capetown."

We visited several wineries, the Biscuit Mill (a famous food market), went paragliding, shark diving, did a full tour of the Cape Peninsula as well as a tour of District 6 and the townships. The guides were also happy to accommodate our requests from asking where we can buy snowball souvenirs on our way to the airport to finding out which bars are best suited for drinks while watching kites surfers. Pieter, the owner of the company, was happy cutting short his day off and coming to get us on a 15 minute notice to visit the Cheetahs. For the townships, our tour guide was from the township and his tour gave us a great insight on how life in the townships are. Roelf took us to a visit of the Cape Peninsula as well as to a full day tour of the wineries and is very pleasant and knowledgeable.

Thankfully, Pieter was just the man to get our hearts pumping and legs burning! Our first afternoon with him had us hiking up Table Mountain on one of its more strenuous routes. Whenever we did take a break, Pieter and Roelf were excellent raconteurs, telling tall tales about the history of their great city. They timed the hike so that we arrived at the top close to sunset - as it was a clear day, the views were simply incredible.On our second day with PG Tops, we spent the morning downhill mountain biking both in Tokai Forest, and from the top of Chapman's Peak. We then did our best to replenish spent calories at a local eatery - mission accomplished!We were very impressed with how PG Tops catered to our specific needs - it's obvious that they possess a wide body of knowledge about the area, and that they truly enjoy delivering top-class service.

I contacted PG Tops to arrange a tour of the Garden Route for me and a good friend of mine and Pieter, the owner of PG Tops, worked with me (mostly via email) to plan what turned out to be a fabulous 6-night adventure along South Africa's beautiful Garden Route. Pieter was our guide for the entire trip and was fun, energetic, and extremely knowledgeable about the region and all things South Africa. He is extremely passionate about his country and showing his guests a great time. Some memorable highlights included an early morning bike ride near Cape Agulhas (southern tip of Africa), canoeing in an area known as Wilderness (with a picnic breakfast at a lovely waterfall), a scenic walk to the Knysna Heads, hanging out at Afrovibe Backpackers, and visiting Tsitsikamma National Park. Also, I must mention that Pieter and his team were a great resource in helping us plan our time in Cape Town and recommending some great day trips -- Cape Point & Peninsula Tour; and a visit to the winelands. PG Tops is a top notch company & I would definitely recommend them to anyone visiting Cape Town or the surrounding areas!"

We had planned to do a Peninsula tour the first half-day, followed by a half-day winelands tour the next day. We had anticipated a relaxing, sedate, pleasant tour of the area, but what we got was so much more! Tony picked us up around 8 am on the first day, and drove us down the coast, stopping at a few popular tourist destinations, but focusing on more interesting and less well-known spots. We saw so many beautiful places along the way, including Clifton Bay, Chapman's Point, Long Beach, Buffel's Bay, and of course the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point. We had a wonderful sushi lunch at the restaurant at Cape Point, overlooking the sea. Saw the penguins and a few other cute little coastal towns along the way. Tony was a knowledgeable, fun, energetic guide, and the conversation flowed easily for the many hours we spent in the van. It quickly became apparent what one of his passions was, shark cage diving. We discussed it for quite some time, and decided that we absolutely had to do this instead of driving around the winelands. Tony contacted Pieter and we were able to set it up for the following day. We appreciated the flexibility and were very excited for our new adventure. Tony picked us up at 4 am the next morning and we set off for the 2.5 hour or so drive to Gansbaai. By this time, we were laughing and talking like old friends, so we enjoyed the drive and the sunrise over the mountains was beautiful. The shark cage diving excursion was booked with Marine Dynamics. We really liked this company because of their focus on education, conservation, and research. Several volunteers and researchers were on board, and much of the company's profits go toward those ends. This was truly an amazing experience! We rode about 15-20 minutes out in very rough waters, until we reached shark alley. I will review the excursion separately, but I will just say that we had several close encounters with GIANT great whites, saw several southern right whales, and Geyser island, which is referred to as \"seal island\" or \"McDonald's\" for sharks... This was one of the highlights of our entire trip, one that we will never forget!After warming up from our time on the boat, Tony took us on a mini-wine tour, and we had lunch at Creation winery. The tasting menu was OK. Some of the canapes were a bit dry and the service was not great, but the wine was exceptional and the company enjoyable.We highly recommend PG Tops, particularly Tony. We felt like we got an insider's tour of the peninsula and VIP treatment on the shark cage dive. We passed giant tour buses full of tourists, and were so thankful that we had our own personal guide rather than a canned, scripted tour of the area with 50 other people."

Fantastic service with personalized attention to your interests. Yolanda is not only informative and interesting, but also entertaining - she is like traveling with a good friend. Her winery choices were excellent as were her chosen stops on the Cape Point tour. Highly recommend PG Tops! Robert & Ingrid, Gig Harbor, WA USA."

The six of us (including four 20+ year olds) just returned from South Africa and had an extraordinary experience with PG Tops tours of Cape Town and the surrounding area. Pieter (our tour guide) was highly informative, easily kept our interest for the entire trip, and was able to relate to everyone in our group, but particularly to the 20+ year olds who had never been to Cape Town before. His knowledge is exceptional, which is often true of guides, but most importantly, he was able to make the trip a highly personalized experience for each person in our group. His colleague, Godfrey, who took us on a township tour of Langa was also extraordinary. We would all highly recommend both of them to any family that is travelling to South Africa."

Cannot say enough good things about Pieter, we spent two days with him on a guided tour of Cape Town and the surrounding areas, and each day was jam-packed with wonderful adventures! Pieter was a breeze to deal with and so flexible, we got his name from a coworker only a few days before we were heading to CT and luckily he had space for us, so a few emails later we were all sorted. We spent a wonderful day in wine country and one doing the peninsula drive, and I can't imagine how they could've been better. His knowledge of the area is top notch, but what really made this trip such a pleasure is his attention to detail and getting all the small things right. He struck a great balance of giving us some options on stuff to do, but without making it seem like we were doing all the work, and he was flexible as our plans changed (or the weather) so we always had something on tap next. The most important thing is that he's just a great guy, someone you will enjoy spending time with (as are his colleagues I'm sure) and I have a lot of respect for the fact that he just started this business up himself and cares so deeply about it. Highest compliment I can give is that I never felt over the course of two days like we were on a guided tour, it truly felt like we had a friend in town who was showing us around. Great job Pieter, thanks for all the great memories, and we hope to see you on another trip to CT soon!Mike&Alison"

Roelof picked us up from the airport and was such a breath of fresh air after the grueling trip from the States. Godfrey took us on a township tour in Langa the next day which was a truly life changing experience. The third day we met Pieter for a dramatic car trip down the coast to the Cape of Good Hope. Pieter is intelligent, fun, and can always be counted on to tell a Chuck Norris joke or five :) Ask him to play some South African pop music for you... I promise you won't be disappointed! I give PG Tops my highest recommendation and hope to travel with them again in the future!"

From the immediate response to my email inquiry (by Pieter who was actually on a mountain in the middle of a hike) right down to the end of our 2 days of touring with our guide, Roelf, PG demonstrated professionalism while providing top-notch service. We are 3 young professionals from Canada working in Johannesburg for 2 months and thus we only had one long weekend to spend in Cape Town. Not only was PG tours able to provide us with a private tour (in a swanky BMW) which hit all the spots on our must-see lists but as Roelf got to know us he made recommendations for additional stops which he thought we would enjoy. Our guide was fully prepared with contact information for all the tourist hot spots (and a number of local places too) to ensure that our tour was flawless. Roelf was extremely knowledgeable about pretty much everything and he was fun to hang out with as well! By the end of our tour we definitely felt as though we had made a new friend. I would definitely recommend PG tours for anyone visiting Cape Town \u2013 I know I\u2019ll be calling them next time I come back!"

She even made hard-to get reservations at the famous La Petite Ferme restaurant and it was wonderful! In summary, PG Tours did a wonderful job and really seemed to go above and beyond to make sure that we had the best experience possible, and we did! Both of us would highly recommend them."

My partner and I booked Pieter (PG Tops) for a full day tour of Cape Town as a way of seeing the most sights in the short time that we had in Cape Town but also to have a knowledgeable guide. Pieter filled both of these roles! A great start for me was the addition of a coolbox with water and a couple of cans of beer for the journey! This was undertaken in a spacious air conditioned van and as it was just me and my partner, we had plenty of space to enjoy!The tour itself covered everything we wanted to see from the natural wonders of Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope, the penguins and Boulders Beach to the markets and shops in Simonstown and of course the vineyard tours. A very well rounded tour covering everything that we wanted to do with a good variety to stop us getting bored. We felt relaxed and not hurried but also able to make our own decisions about how we wanted the day to go, with tips and suggestions from Pieter. Finally to add that a big part for us booking with Pieter was the speed of his responses to emails and also the Website appearance. Both very professional. The website is informative but also lends a bit of fun to the tours and services offered. One evening in the UK I sent an email at about 1830 UK time (1930 in SA) which was responded to within about 30-40 minutes. I was not expecting anything until the next day but to have the answers straight away just made it one less thing to do before the holiday. Great service, informative, non intrusive and good fun, highly recommended."

Yolande was there to meet us off the flight and was so friendly, welcoming and professional that we booked her for two one-day private tours - to Cape Point and to the Winelands.  On both occasions, Yolande was punctual, fun to be with and a mine of information. Importantly, too, the mini bus was clean and well-maintained.  PG Tops is a small company with the personal touch. An advantage of this is that staff can really get to know their clients and flexibility can be built into trips to suit the needs and interests of those travelling. This is a feature usually lacking with larger tour companies who are tied to rigid schedules.  We will most definitely be booking this company again."

Our goal was to visit as many \u201cmust see\u201d sites while having some down time to simply enjoy the environment. We rented apartments on the V&A Waterfront, which put us in a prime location for visiting the shops and fabulous restaurants. We were also in close proximity to the convention center which was hosting the Annual Cape Town International Jazzfest - it was fabulous. With that said, we feel as though we made some really good choices. But I must add that selecting PG Tops and staff was our best choice by far. The owner, Pieter Geldenhuys, worked with us to build a two-day itinerary that not only kept us on budget, but covered the \"must sees\" we requested. For example, my group visited Table Mountain with the opportunity to ride the cable cars up the mountain, District 6 Museum which provides in-depth information on South African apartheid, as well as a 2-hour walking tour of a township, meeting the people, talking to students and witnessing everyday life. The tour concluded with an authentic African meal at a local restaurant \u2013 what a surprise! We even had our own private entertainment. Great day!!! And big shoutout to Godfrey, our tour guide for the day. Godfrey speaks with an innate knowledge of the area, the people, and the mix of cultures. He is a kind man with expert familiarity. We could not have asked for more - thanks Godfrey! Also, special shoutout to Roelf who guided us on our Day 2 safari. Again, you can make your tour as adventurous as you dare - Pieter will make it happen. I strongly recommend PG Tops for all your tour needs. It is especially convenient to have their door-to-door pickup service along with the overall feeling of safety and comfort.Thanks Everyone!"

One of the highlights of the trip -- and of our relationship -- was a day spent touring the Cape of Good Hope Peninsula (and other Cape Town Sites) with Pieter Geldenhuys, Owner of PG Tops. The weather was rainy, but it made no difference -- the scenery was stunning and dramatic. Even better was the running commentary from Pieter -- which included a highly knowledgeable history of South Africa. Four years later, we are still in touch with him -- and got to talk to him today as he helped us (remotely) buy some beaded animal heads at an outdoor market in Cape Town.

I travelled to South Africa for my brother in laws 40th birthday for a long weekend and we had our heart set on doing some deep sea fishing off Cape Point but as often is the case the sea was too rough for us to go out and we didnt fancy spending four hours feeling ill! Enter stage left Pieter Geldenhuys the owner of PG Tops to the rescue. The day was simply brilliant. Picked up in a smart air-conditioned vehicle complete with refreshments, Pieter set about asking us questions to see what made us tick so he could match the wineries to our personalities and interests which I thought was a great touch. We visited 3 (or 4, I forget!) vineyards, each of them stunning yet uniquely different. Pieter thought very carefully where to take us and nailed it each time as we had the full spectrum of experiences. From the beauty and tranquility of Solms-Delta, a vineyard with an intriguing history and the charismatic Leon to recount it, through to the opulence of the Provence vineyard with its distinctly french feel. All the wines (and food we had) were superb but Solms Delta was the standout for us simply for its authentic South African feel, history and the fact its set up as a trust so that the workers all benefit from its success. I bought 60 bottles there!In addition to the fabulous wine adventure, Pieter also asked us if there was anything else we wanted to do so he took us to a huge, vibrant, uniquely South African open air bar in a township. Hundreds of friendly people with their families enjoying one of the biggest BBQ come dances in a bar I am sure I will ever see. It was brilliant because it was real life. We ended what was a great day with Pieter dropping us off in Camps Bay for dinner. I really do highly recommend PG Tops because apart from Pieter and his team being genuinely nice, they put the effort in to make your day what you want, so there is not just one formula here and I thought it was great value for money especially since the day is tailored to your interests. Thanks again Pieter."

Positively mind-blowing. Also worth noting is the invigorating 45-minute trek from Cape of Good Hope to Cape Point, and the hike up to the lighthouse once you get there; the local crafts on display and for sale at Hout Bay; and the architectural charms of Simons Town.

            "review": "He's one of the best guides in all of South Africa. Traveling with PG Tops was an excellent experience for me. I was traveling with iKapa Tours and they booked me with Pieter for the weekend to do some hiking, visits to the botanical gardens and a visit to a Township. He was on time, and most accommodating for anything I wanted to do. We ended up having such a memorable weekend traveling around all of cape town and seeing things I wanted to see, which meant going outside of the box. We went to the Old Biscuit Mill and watched as the well-to-do South Africans ate their morning away eating delicious bites of wonderful organic fare. The place is a \"dont miss\" in my books if you plan to be in Cape Town for the weekend. For contract he then took me into town and had me walk through another market, much different than the bright and cheery biscuit mill. This market is the hot spot for the ethnic minded wanting to eat some amazing Indian and African dishes! The smells were to die for! It was dark in there but you could tell this is were flavor really comes through! Although I was alone, he made me feel very at home and was open in sharing all sorts of facets of South African life. We went for a walk along the waterfront where locals take their dogs, visited the botanical gardens, and took me on the most amazing Township tour I've ever been on. Pieter is loved by many and his partners in one of South Africa's largest townships, provided one of the most relevant and non-intrusive look at South Africans who live in Township. This isn't about pointing out a bunch of poverty stricken individuals but rather seeing how people living in these ares are working to create a better life for themselves. Its truly an amazing experience and nothing like I've seen with other outfits and I travel a lot. PG Tops is the only guiding company I will travel with from here on out. You simply can't go wrong with these guys!"

Attentive, schedule was adapted without a problem after I had a wish to visit a certain winery, which unfortunately didn't exist anymore. A short time request for a visit to Cape Good Hope the next day was immediately arranged by phoning an acquaintance. Very personal but not too. Just right. You should discuss politics with Pieter, he is very well informed. You have to ask him though."

            "review": "Fantastic tour of Stellenbosch with flexibility and professional panache!. Recently taking a girls trip, 6 ladies met up in South Africa for some holiday fun. PG Tops gave us a fantastic day tour of Stellenbosch. We were guided through some of South Africa's finest vineyards. They were clearly strategically chosen to give a full flavor of all the unique and lovely vineyards that they area has to offer. The day was planned out with an array of vineyards and vino that was top notch. All we had to do was merely show up and the legwork was done for us. The vineyards selected were so original and unlike most of what we would see wine tasting in the US. Essentially, the landscape blows Napa out of the water, and PG Tops excelled at showcasing this region in its full glory. PG Tops arranged for a driver and was completely flexible with timing and drop off, exceedingly cordial, and just in general led us through a fabulous day. Highly recommended utilizing this company on your stay in Cape Town and surrounding areas!"

He even took us to a rugby game when it was all over (for no additional fee) and explained all the rules to us. It felt like we were hanging out with a friend in South Africa and made Cape Town the best part of my trip!"

I had an absolute blast and learned so much about SA and the history! Things I would have never learned any other way! I did a full day tour and could have kept going. I'd highly suggest this tour company!"

I have not met a person who is so passionate about their backyard and a couple of hours with him he'll have you hooked. I love my rugby so when I saw he was doing a trip to Newlands to watch the Stormers v Blues i jumped on it straight away. Pre game antics consisted of a braai and a few castle lagers surrounded by hundreds of amped up Stormers supporters with the amazing Table Mountain in the background. It completely blew my mind. The vibe was amazing...oh and the seats werent too bad either! Pieter has so many great day trips, he even tried to get me ostrich riding! Unfortunately I ran out of time but if I ever make it back to Cape Town i'll be looking him up and you should too!"

            "review": "Best private tours - saves time and hassle.. When we visit South Africa next time, we will definitely use Pieter G at PG Tops. He is very professional. He took us on a gourmet tour of the winelands. We visited four of the top wineries in the region. We tried the bubbly that was served at the Obama and Mandela inaugurations. Pieter took us for lunch at a winery with spectacular food and a breathtakingly picturesque view. We were short on time, so he made sure we saw as many sights as we could in one day. We were able to go to seal island, see the penguins at Boulder's beach and hike up the Cape of Good Hope. We even managed to see a whale and her calf out of season. His prices are very reasonable as well for a private tour guide. For a few dollars more (not much), he got us a private transfer to and from Hermanus (a 2.5 hour drive)....not to mention, his BMW is much, much nicer and more comfortable than a big tour bus :) I highly recommend PG Tops."
