            "review": "Argentine Tango classes with Alejandro. We spent two hours learning some Argentine Tango with Alejandro. What a wonderful experience! We\u2019re long time ballroom dancers and more recently west coast swing dancers who\u2019ve previously been introduced to Argentine tango. It\u2019s difficult to transition from the ballroom world of patterns to the intimate conversation between partners where communication is everything. We began with posture and feet position, learned about weight changes and how to walk. Sounds simple, but it\u2019s not (for us anyway). Alejandro masterfully got us to understand what that means. The elements of lead and follow make a lot of sense when you think about them. The leader must \u201cspeak\u201d to the follower with movement in a clear and timely manner. And the follower must \u201clisten\u201d to the leader\u2019s movement, and feel the direction and speed. Each needs to be aware of his axis and also be in time with the music. As Argentine Tango has no set patterns and is \u201cjust walking\u201d to music, the joy of the dance is the improvisation, which takes focus. Alejandro would dance as follower with me and as leader with my wife to illustrate what makes a lead clear and a follow intuitive. It\u2019s fun when it starts to work for you! Alejandro then took us a bit further introducing us to slightly more advanced moves, again illustrating the concepts very clearly.Overall we enjoyed Alejandro\u2019s teaching style and personality very much. And his hourly charge is quite reasonable. We would gladly take more classes with him if we had more time in Buenos Aires."

He is a super teacher, also very thoughtful and encouraging for the slightly nervous student- he put me at ease and I can't wait to do more when I get back home. The studio is central and easy to find- I travelled by subway alone and felt very safe. Thank you so much!"

Starting with the history of tango he took us through the basics and the class was paced well for our level.We had never danced before but he made us feel comfortable and made sure we understood each section before moving forward.We did a 2 hour lesson and this was a great start. I wouldn't start with anything less. Alejandro was prfoessional and clearly passionate which helped make our experience memorable."

            "review": "Dancing at milongas after a month of lessons - and not badly either!. The decision to take lessons from Alejandro was influenced heavily by the reviews from everyone on tripadvisor. And BOY am I glad that we did, because my partner and I can't help but feel that we've completely been lucky finding Alejandro as our teacher, as dancers beginning tango from the very beginning. As everyone has said so far, Alejandro really really knows his stuff. The best thing about him is that he helps us understand WHY we have to do a certain thing at a certain time, and this will be applicable in every step/move that we will ever do in this dance, and in fact, any dance. The fundamentals have just opened up our eyes like no other teacher has ever done before, and we are able to realise our own steps, and experiment with moves using the fundamental formulas that Alejandro has taught us. Ultimately, if you want to be dancing well - socially - you can't have a teacher that teaches you a combo of moves because your progress will stop as soon as you stop taking classes with that teacher. Alejandro has equipped us to dance well and truly beyond our classes with him, but we love taking classes with him because he has such amazing energy to him that is contagious and is bottomless with knowledge AND passionate about the dance and its history. If you want to get a bang for your buck, and for your time (most importantly), Alejandro will definitely be your best bet. He may not appear to be the teacher of flashiest of moves, but if you take classes with him, you will soon understand that embellishments that you see in tango are the easiest to learn - what he will teach you will be the bread and butter that you will need to execute the prettiest and the flashiest of embellishments WELL.Like the title of my review, my partner and I, starting off from taking simple, walking steps for numerous hours to begin with, to now (a month later), we are dancing at milongas with other people, and being asked again by argentinos who appreciate our part in the dance. It's been truly a pleasant and fun experience, and we will definitely miss him and his classes when we return home at the end of next month. We have said that tango immersions will be a regular thing in our life ahead, and when we return to this amazing city, we will ask Alejandro to be our teacher time and time again.We are so thankful for your approach and sincerity in sharing your love for tango with us. We have come to love it so much, and your part in that has been more than you'll know. Thanks for being such an amazing teacher and a fond memory of our stay in Buenos Aires!! :)"

We have been dancing tango for a couple of years in Holland and were looking to improve our technique and musicality. He started by looking at our dancing and then danced with both of us seperately. He observed and immediately was able to verbalize some pointers and what he would like to do in our lesson, based on what we wanted to learn. What we really liked was that he was able to explain in words what we should do or feel, and he made sure we had the tools to make it happen before switching to a new part. We learned A LOT and have a better understanding of the fundamentals of tango. We are super excited to put our lessons to practice! If you would like to learn tango or improve your skills, this is your guy! Thank you Alejandro :)"

I have discovered that I can get to the next level almost without realizing it. By nature, I like to be in control of a situation. Tango requires letting the leader take over, while the follower must actively participate. When we hear \"it takes two to tango\" we know it refers to two people equally sharing the responsibility. The leader leads, but the follower must be thoroughly engaged. Your mind and your emotions must be in perfect sink. It's so much more than technique and steps. Many teachers focus on technique without helping their students understand the true meaning of tango. That's what separates Alejandro from most tango instructors."

He's a phenomenal teacher, highly knowledgable about all of tango, but beyond that he's patient and knows how to give good critique in the most encouraging way. What I love about his teaching method is he doesn't believe in teaching you combinations of steps, but rather in giving you the building blocks you will need when it comes to improvising on the dance floor. It was an absolute pleasure working with Alejandro, and I know the next time I'm back in Buenos Aires I will be seeing him again."

Unfortunately I only had enough time for two private lessons with Alejandro, but, those two lessons gave me so much information about the functionalities of the movement, the history, the music and the confidence to dance in the Milonga's each night. I am a professional dancer from London and understand when a teacher really knows their stuff, Alejandro goes to great lengths to make you feel comfortable but pushes you so that you come away from each lesson with a new discovery. You will learn how to be precise, understand the musicality and explore yourself through Tango. Whilst doing all of this you will definitely laugh and although his teaching will certainly improve you as a Tango dancer, he will remind you along the way to ENJOY IT! See you soon Alejandro!

            "review": "Thank you Alejando!!!!. Thank you Alejandro! I could write so much here but I know I rarely read a long review, so simply said he is the whole package. He can teach you how to follow and lead, he will teach you about the music and how it affects how you move and dance tango and he can teach you the body mechanics to help you with technique, balance, axis and learning those fancy steps. I am a physical therapist and a Pilates instructor, so it was music to my ears when he explained things in terminology that I use when teaching patients how to move again after an injury and say it in a way that anyone could understand. Did I mention a centrally located studio that has air-conditioning and he speaks excellent English?For some details if you are still with me. I took lessons last February and March and I am scheduled to do so again this February and March. I came to him as a so so beginner with group lessons, private lessons and several tango festivals under my belt. It is hard to sum up what I learned in the lessons I had with him, lets just say it was a lot. At the first lesson he asked me what I wanted to get from the lessons. I said my main goal was to become a better follower and that I did for sure! But I came away with so much more. The thing that surprise me the most was how much I learned about the music. I learn to identify the different orchestras, and how and why understanding and feeling the music from the inside as well as the outside not only makes you a better follower it makes you a better dancer. I also came away with the ability to connect better with my partner and with the music, thus I became a much better follower. Now when I dance I feel like I am playing with the music and it is oh so much fun!"

Our group of 15 started our trip in Argentina with our first night under the tutelage of Alejandro Puerta. Alejandro lesson not only provided us the philosophical connection to tango, but the embodiment one must have for the grace to dance. Our tour of Tango started with the rich history of Argentina and the role Tango played, to moving and gliding, feeling the beat and finally feeling the power of connection with your partner. We continued on this adventure with a true Milonga. The ladies in our group witnessed firsthand the art of the cabaceo (Gentlemen -you will need a lesson from Alejandro for this one). The welcoming joy felt by all; from our group of novices to the graceful practiced Argentinians, as we witnessed the art of tango in Argentina, truly amazing.The learning\u2019s and soulful grace in which Alejandro teaches is for all ages and should be embraced by all."

I have had the pleasure to study with Alejandro for two months at the beginning of the year and as we can see from this review, like everyone that studies with him I absolutely loved it!I am a professional dancer but I had never danced tango before (only in my dreams) and Alejandro was a great discovery for my training.I found a very deep approach, knowledgeable about the body and its mechanics. The aesthetics of the movement were just a result of the functionality. I extremely recommend taking classes with him if you are interested in the real understanding of tango as movement language.Alejandro's classes will teach you not only combinations of steps that you will forget but the way to listen or to lead in the most open and clear way. His teachings will stay with you.His style as a partner is fun and versatile I loved dancing with him!"

The two-hour lesson my two friends and I took with him was by far our most meaningful and memorable experience in Buenos Aires. Alejandro is not just a tango teacher. He is a wise, conscientious, perceptive, and warm person who has developed a life philosophy that he expresses through dance. In his impeccable English, Alejandro explained the origins and cultural importance of tango. He then introduced the core movements one by one, endowing each with a higher meaning and significance. We had no experience in tango or in any formal dance, and we left with a deep appreciation for the dynamic of the tango partnership. Alejandro also made dancing feel very natural and instinctive -- almost meditative.We only wish we had more days in BA to continue our learning. Do not miss this chance to learn something about Argentina, and about yourself!"

            "review": "He has it all!. Alejandro is among the very best teachers of tango I've encountered. First of all, he is positive, affirming and supportive. Unlike many teachers who, for whatever reason, are full of 'no-thats not how it's done', Alejandro conveys the materials in a positive and constructive way. Research shows that affirmative teaching works the best and it does for me as well. Secondly, Alejandro can address whatever you wish to learn and is skilled and articulate (in English in my case) in conveying the materials. I wanted to work on posture, smooth walking, sacadas and musicality. Over the course of 2 solid weeks of classes I was very happy with my improvements. Lastly, he both leads and follows and can analyze you from either perspective and give feedback. He's also friendly and a nice guy! If you are looking for a tango instructor who listens and can help you improve, then he is the guy."

In fact, based on my previous experience of Alejandro\u2019s classes, I have now booked for an entire month and I am really looking forward to it! Alejandro is an exceptional teacher, kind and soft spoken, as well as passionately devoted to his art, a combination of qualities not easily found. What truly impressed me is that even though Alejandro focuses on building technique with great attention to detail, he never loses sight of the true enjoyment of dancing. His approach is wholistic and never misses a chance to teach you about the philosophy and history of the tango, both of which he knows really well. Also, I believe that one of the things that distinguishes a gifted teacher is his ability to discern the root causes of a student\u2019s weaknesses and focus on them, not in a negative but a constructive and inspiring way. I loved how my dancing technique radically improved without feeling pressured or stressed in any way and I loved loved loved the traditional milonga we visited, where I felt so privileged to be able to dance at such ease for the first time in my life, among milongueros with the support and encouragement of Alejandro."

He will greet you in his pristine, parquet-floored, air-conditioned studio on Calle Boulogne sur Mer and will expertly and patiently guide you through the fundamental rules of this elegant dance.His perfect English (as well as Japanese! and of course, Spanish) makes his teaching easy to understand for everyone.From his training as a biologist (in his former life, he says jokingly), he has kept a scientific approach to the basic movements of tango. Whether you are a (male or female) leader or a follower, he commands both the knowledge and experience of the dance and will teach you how to smoothly glide on the floor to the sound of an extraordinarily varied and colorful music.... Well, learning to dance the tango doesn't come in 3 easy lessons!...but with Alejandro's guidance and patience , you will learn the essential elements if you are a beginner. If you already have some experience, he will correct your postural errors and will take you to a higher level.I met him last November and took about 10 hours of lessons with him. I made such progress that as soon as I returned to Europe, my mind was set on going back to Argentina for more!I have now returned from my 2nd trip: an exhilarating experience where I took intensive lessons every day for over 2 weeks....I gradually gained confidence, forgetting my unnerving self-consciousness, understanding the complexity of the silent dialogue that is tango, until I was finally able (although for a minute!) to feel connected to him and let myself be guided by his expert abrazo....Pure bliss! .I was only sorry that I had to leave!My experience with Alejandro has been so beneficial that I have no other word to say than: Go try it!He is the most courteous, talented and enjoyable person and a \"magnifique\" ambassador of his life's passion: the tango!"

I say, he teaches more from naturally finding the steps and moves with unmistakable precision and style by being present and connected to our dance partner and the music.I believe this is authentic Argentinean Tango!Tango never pretended to be a choreographed or stipulated set of moves or steps out of which a dancer would be considered good or bad. Tango was born and exists out of the most deepest desire of human beings to be connected. Having only taken 3 classes with Alejandro, we were all able to enjoy dancing at Milongas. Among my friends I have seen people who came speaking in very soft voices, now speaking louder and in more assertive terms. Others came unable to be less than 18 in closer to another human being, now being able to dance in a very close embrace, chest to chest.Others clearly rediscovering their beauty, their passion, being able to move and speak in ways that have been hidden and suppressed for some time, even years and decades. We all definitely got in touch with ourselves. Thank you Buenos Aires, thank you Tango, THANK YOU ALEJANDRO!"

It doesn't matter how bad of a dancer you think you are, Alejandro can teach you. He is patient, kind, warm, and sensitive to his students, and not only do I consider him my great teacher but I consider him my great friend.

However his relaxed and approachable teaching style quickly put us at ease. A 2hour lesson was just right. There is loads to take in and an hour would have felt too brief I think. I particularly appreciated that Alejandro taught us more than just the basic steps. He introduced us to the philosophy of tango, linked to its cultural origins and helped us to understand that dancing together is far more than a mechanical process. I never thought a beginner's tango lesson would be so interesting!Don't be concerned about footwear if you are a beginner - we danced in socks. The studio is easy to get to by subway and Alejandro was prompt and helpful in email communication prior to our lesson.Thank you for a memorable experience!"

Well, I returned to Buenos Aires in December and took more lessons, but this time with my boyfriend. So, now I have confirmed that Alejandro is able to teach a couple with as much success as one person. His talent to teach two individuals of different levels is extraordinary. I will continue to take classes with him. In other words, I am doing myself a favor. Buenos Aires, with Alejandro's lessons takes a new dimension."

            "review": "the magic continues. This was my second visit to BA and I couldn't wait to continue my tango classes with Alejandro! (In Oct 2014, I had daily classes with Ale during my month in BA.) He continues to be an excellent teacher. Upbeat, focused, considerate and so very very knowledgeable and competent at explaining, demonstrating and encouraging. During my 5 week visit over Nov 2015, I had 90 minute private classes 3 times a week. That pattern worked very well for me --- allowing things to settle a bit, and giving an opportunity to get to the milongas. And so often, something reviewed in class was exactly what I needed at the milonga that evening. Ale's strength as a teacher lies not just in his ability to dance well (and he does!!) but to explain it in a way that the student can understand. I am not a young person --- I'm in my early 60's. And I find often elsewhere that things are done too quickly for me to catch on. (I am NOT slow, just not as quick as some others!!) Ale understands that different people learn in different ways at different speeds and he accommodates readily to the student's learning style. And to note: he speaks excellent English and has a great sense of humour. AND he is always open to questions, comments. I put my trust completely in Ale as a teacher. Apart from asking him to review something, I let him set the lesson plan. He knows my goal: to become a better dancer. And the only other \"instruction\" I give him is to not let me learn bad habits. Obviously, a good teacher is not all that is necessary --- the student has to focus, put in the effort, practice, and get out to the milongas and try it out. (What fun!) And I can say that with Ale's classes and guidance and getting out dancing, I did make significant improvements. All that and it is enjoyable. Having a class with Ale is better than the spa! Like at the spa --- one is attended to, given careful attention and allowed to relax and enjoy a pleasant time. With Ale, it is the sweet music and movement of tango. Ale never forgets that we are doing this for enjoyment, to improve, of course, but to enjoy the journey, the music and the connection. Thanks Ale for your teaching. I'll be back next year to continue. See you then!Stan"

Something deeper, touching the soul, a kind a connection with yourself and the partner. My first plan was to take lessons with several teachers to have different views of tango. My first lesson was with Alejandro and after one hour, I didn't feel like seing an other teacher. \"I had found a master ;-)\".Alejandro taugh me the basic technic for tango so I could go to milongas and appreciate and take pleasure with the dance. The most important was for me to be able to dance with different partners at milongas, take pleasure and also that the partner enjoy to dance with me. And I can say that was a success. I start with no knowledge in tango and I left as a good beginner with good technics. Alejandro helped me to feel the dancer, to move my body accordingly to the dancer, to relax. So thank you very much Alejandro for sharing your passion and experience. He is patient, very pedagogue, has a very good english, a nice studio, good and different type of music, he a lovely person.Only one regret: he didn't fit in my bagpack and I wasn't able to bring him back home.Thank you very much Alejandro...Hope to see you again soon! :-)"

Alejandro is also quite generous with his time and does his best to be flexible around changing schedules. His primary studio is a lovely sunny space.

Whether you want to try tango for the first time, or if you're interested in progressing in your tango practice, this is the teacher for you. Taking tango lessons with Alejandro Puerta for two hours a day during my two week trip to in Buenos Aires was a beautiful experience. Alejandro's expertise as a dancer and teacher was perfect. He readily evaluated each of my movements and provided clear instruction about how to remediate each one, as needed, plus he taught me new moves at each lesson and practiced each one with me until I got it. Whenever I encountered a move that I found difficult, he was able to break it down into relatable chunks until I was able to grasp the movement as a whole. I practice several types of dance, and I feel that my lessons with Alejandro helped me to become a better technical dancer overall. He is a lovely man whose use of humor combined with a positive attitude made him a joy to work with. He is a proficient, versatile, professional teacher who is capable of helping leads and follows develop in the dance from any starting point. As a teacher myself, I'm picky about dance teachers, and in my opinion Alejandro is top notch. He is a gem whom I feel fortunate to have worked with, and I look forward to working with him again in the future. Tango with Alejandro is a must if you're passing through Buenos Aires.

Rather than simply explain with words, he also demonstrated how a lead might initiate steps differently, which showed how and why the connection and means of communicating through it is important.By the end of the lesson, I was sad to go, but excited about the prospect of more tango.

Our short but sweet visit last April 2015 to Buenos Aires was definitely not long enough after experiencing how great a tango teacher is Alejandro. I could have booked many hours of lesson from him if only we had enough time in Buenos Aires.I had been to many dance instructors and had been through so many years of dance training and competitions and I must say that Alejandro is on top of my list of excellent dance coach....You are truly the best in your ways of dealing with your students and present yourself very professionally...Well done Alejandro Puerta"

I spent 5 days in BBAA and contacted Alejandro just when I arrived asking for Tango lessons for a bloody beginner as I was and also being on my own with no partner. I had a response within a few hours back answering all my questions - also the one on shoes as I only had sneakers with me which are not very Tango but they have been fine for my beginner lessons. His studio is very easy to find in the center of San Telmo - lessons take place in his beautiful studio which has AC and a big mirror.I very much appreciated his unique way to teach by combining in an excellent way the techniques and the required feeling/listening/ connection to the dance and partner thereby giving one the understanding for the essentials of Tango dancing. I had a terrific time, taking 3 lessons in total only but I felt talented and able to dance from the first minute on as he is a great teacher. He also explains about the required accuracy of the signals from a man to a woman and how the connection between a dancing couple works so you know what to dance and how to move.I learned so many things which will also help me with any future classes I will take for sure - thank you Alejandro!!I believe wether you are a beginner or already experienced Alejandro is an outstanding professional teacher who makes you fall in love with Tango and makes sure you get the most out of your lessons."

You can easily pay 3 times as much for big name teachers, but I felt I got just as much out of my lessons with him, if not more. Alejandro has a deep understanding of the technical aspects of tango and an ability to explain and demonstrate clearly so you understand why you need to do something as well as how. He helped me make subtle, yet fundamental refinements to my technique which made an immediate and noticeable difference to my dancing. He is also very positive and encouraging which helps you to relax and feel confident. If/when I return to Buenos Aires I'll definitely be contacting him for more lessons."

Alejandro was very quick to respond to my enquiry and very flexible in arranging our booking. My friend and I had no experience of a tango but Alejandro made us feel so relaxed that by the end of our two hours we felt relatively confident to try out some basic moves in a milonga! His style is patience with passion but also allows you to find your own way into your own style without feeling like you're doing it wrong. His teaching is accompanied by a tango history lesson at the same time and so informative. I can guarantee a session with Alejandro will leave you bitten with the tango bug and a yearning to learn more. Fabulous!"

Alejandro has a rare ability to deconstruct information and to impart it clearly and without fuss. He has an uncanny understanding of exactly what one needs to learn and how much can be absorbed in each lesson. I left each session a little more confident than when I\u2019d walked in. And it was a confidence based on real work, real feedback, and real progress. His lessons are well organized and I knew each time what the intention and goal was. He is also a person of poetic sensitivity and mischievous humour and he takes a warm and positive approach to teaching. Dancing with him in the classes is an utter delight. If you want to improve your dancing for the real life of the milonga; if you want to understand how tango translates in your own body; and if you want to build mastery, then I highly recommend private classes with Alejandro."

I am a Salsa dancer and had never tried Tango before, but a while ago I decided that I really wanted to learn it. So I was very excited to finally come to Buenos Aires, the home of real Tango!Although I had a recommendation for a different Tango teacher in Buenos Aires, I decided to try with Alejandro because I really liked his philosophy and his reviews. I can truly say that I had the best tango experience I could have ever wished for thanks to Alejandro! I did not expect to learn that much considering the little time that we had together! Coming from a salsa background, Tango was a very new concept for me. But Alejandro\u2019s teaching is intuitive and everything is about the connection between the dancers (which actually also helps you to better understand other dances as well). Of course, as an absolute Tango beginner I still have a bit of a way to go to become a good dancer of tango. But with Alejandro\u2019s help, I could already develop a very good basis to build upon and a great understanding of the tango music and the dance. I really cant wait to be back in Buenos Aires and take more classes with Alejandro! Everybody, who wants to learn real Tango (and not only a pattern of various steps) should go and take classes with Alejandro! Definitely one of the best dance teachers I\u2019ve ever had!

From there we worked on musicality and getting the feel for how the lead gives cues to the follow (connectivity). Every lesson started with a dance where we would \"review\" what we had worked on previously but he would always throw in a few new steps! To my surprise, the work we did on recognizing where the weight of the lead and the direction of the torso was guiding me I actually got some of the steps without realizing it! From there, he helped me fine tune little details and add some flourishes to make it look prettier. Last night, I dreamt in Spanish and... I danced TANGO!!! Thanks, Alejandro!

Neither my partner nor I had danced Argentine Tango before, but we had done a little bit of social ballroom and Latin American dancing, so this was a new experience altogether.What a delight it turned out to be! Alejandro is an intuitive director of dance, who is able to gauge the requirements of both leader and follower and stresses the connection that is so essential in a shared experience such as a beautiful and fluid tango should be. The connection goes beyond the steps and is the true heart of the dance. I suspect that there are many levels to this dance and I also suspect that you can experience all, or any of them - depending on your own level of requirement - in Alejandro\u2019s skilled hands.Above all, we had fun with Alejandro and learnt so much about the philosophy and passion of the dance and we couldn\u2019t wait to return for each lesson.

As well as sharing some of the history, he also explained the connections that occur in tango - between the two dancers, with the music, and among the other dancers sharing the floor with you. (And his English is excellent so if you don't speak Spanish very well, don't worry!) It was a very interesting part of the lessons and integral to understanding tango itself. His dancing is smooth and fluid and his particular way of leading makes it easy to understand the basic steps as well as the connection in just a few lessons. He was quick to notice the things I was not picking up right away and adjust his movements and explanations to get me back on track. He even taught me a few flourishes to keep things fun! I learned more in those few lessons than I ever expected. It really was the best tango education experience during my whole stay. I hope to go back and study more with him someday.

Washing up on the shores of the Rio Plata, in the unique city of Buenos Aires, at an age when I could be forgiven for staying home and playing with my grandchildren, I had only one purpose.. bailar tango!Seduced here by a younger amiga, (who had become a true tango addict!) who promised that her teacher would help me reach my goal,I arrived at Alejandro's door on my 67th birthday! I had been expecting some intimidating dude with slicked back hair and a bad suit with an attitude to match, like dancers I had seen in tango shows, so you can imagine my delight when this lovely, hip looking man with a big smile, warm dark eyes, and long curling hair opened the ornate wooden door of his studio building. As he took me up the rickety old fashioned elevator, we began to talk, and before my first step of tango, I felt connected to the teacher. He lives the philosophy of tango. The connection...he establishes it right away and then teaches you how to do it in the dance. His slim body gives out the form and the signals that he wants you to understand. He never shows off, and he never throw something at you that you can't deal with.In that first lesson, I could not believe my ineptitude. My body did not connect with itself, much less with him. I realized that I had lost the natural instinct to revel in dancing that I recalled from my youth. But Alejandro did not make me feel bad. On the contrary, he patiently began to teach me the basics of tango, emphasizing the very things that were standing in my way. Step by step, I began to learn. For two months we persevered. Over time, I noticed my body begin to change. The problems that had devilled me for the past few years began to melt away. Most importantly, through his sensitive encouragement and determined teaching, I discovered the tango queen who lives inside me, and she began to take over the dance, and indeed my life. How can I thank this brilliant teacher? There is no way, except to hopefully encourage you to choose Alejandro Puerta when you come to Buenos Aires.

Tango is a beautiful form of dance, but tango with Alejandro turned out to be a form of healing as well. His lessons effectively combine the theory and practice of tango, and felt therapeutic because of his attentive approach and fine capacity to observe his students and tailor his teaching to their needs - just like visiting a good doctor! Alejandro could see what I needed when I didn't even know. By teaching me that tango is about connection, with oneself as well as with dancing partners, he has given me a gift that has had effects throughout my entire life.

His methodical and personalized approach improved not only my ability to dance, but also changed the way I think about seemingly simple things like balance and body language. Overall, my time with Alejandro was extremely rewarding, and I hope to learn more from him again one day when I return to Buenos Aires. Muchisimas gracias! -Safi"

Over the years, I have studied with more than 2 dozen different teachers (mostly from Argentina) and he truly stands out. He is able to articulate the intricacies of the dance in a superb way - not only because his English is excellent, but also because he is able to use language in a precise and powerful way to empower his student to embody the concepts being worked on. I gained a lot from the privates I took with Alejandro and feel that my dancing was impacted in many positive ways. I have recommended Alejandro to my tango friends and plan to work with him again next time I am in Buenos Aires. A sweet little side bonus is the studio space - for anyone who enjoys beautiful spaces as much as I do, Alejandro's gorgeous studio in San Telmo will be a treat!"

We scheduled 7 two-hour lessons with Alejandro during our two weeks in San Telmo. At the end of our seventh lesson our only regret is that we didn't schedule more lessons. Alejandro has an uncanny ability to communicate the nuances of leading and following through connection. I know this sounds basic but once this subtle communication is tuned it's amazing what's possible on the floor and in life.Learning the tango with Alejandro was an invaluable and unforgettable experience. I highly recommend him to anyone planning a visit to Buenos Aires whether on their own, with a partner or with friends.And his studio is in one of the most beautiful buildings in San Telmo. The view of the city and the market is spectacular."

I had 7 lessons, more or less back to back amongst the 10 days that my girlfriend and i were in Buenos Aries. She can dance. I can't. Well couldn't.Day 1 was pretty cool as when you are working from a base of nothing, everything is new and interesting and we moved on quickly. Alejandro has a great way of establishing not just what your ability and potential might be but also tying any natural physical advantages or disadvantages to how you should progress. He doesn't have a cookie cutter approach. He'll quickly work out what works for you.Day 2, entirely due to me, sucked. I realized that I could not hear the music properly as tango has 'flourishes'. This sounds nice but when you are trying to move and using the music as a guide a flourish becomes a black hole. Your beat disappears if you are not focusing. And given i was trying to remember sequences, not stand all over my girlfriend, tapping a beat over in my head was a poor third on my list. And my natural inability as a male to multi-task, made we want to throw it all up in the air and learn to dance to something a bit more predictable.This for me was when Alejandro came into his own; he gave me really simple techniques to better bolt my tiny brain to my shoes.And these incidentally where bought from a guy he put us in touch with and saved us being otherwise shafted as tourist buying dance shoes. He gave us the best coffee venue to go to so when we finished a lesson, I could go and post analyze my inability whilst suitably wired on local stimulants.And to top it it off the dude is just a really nice guy. I would love to go back there and live one day. Older people in particular just look happier than anywhere i have been before. And when i do, he will be my mate because he's just the easiest guy to get on with and have a laugh.And for you Alejandro - my gift back to you. A useful education in return. Not of the same class or indeed can it be categorized as a life skill. However it will stop you getting yourself in strife again when you misuse what may appear very innocent terminology http://www.effingpot.com/slang.shtml"

I am an OAP from UK and a beginner, but this was not a problem and after a short time actually felt as if I could possibly be able to do this. Whatever happens I can now say that I have danced the tango in Burnos Aires and for that I have Alejandro to thank. Thank you!

However, my experience with Alejandro Puerta was so special it deserves a review. There is much to say, and there is nothing to leave out --- everything about Ale\u2019s teaching is so right. What he teaches, where he teaches and how he teaches all line up for a tremendous experience of tango. During my recent month in Buenos Aires, I had 18 private classes with Ale and each time he was ready to welcome me cheerfully to his studio, to fully share his expertise and he was prepared. Not once did I have a sense of him wondering what to do with me. He was prepared and ready --- he had a plan. What he teaches: I was learning to follow and I was so amazed at how, without teaching me sequences of steps, I was very quickly dancing much better at the milongas. It was about connection, walking, posture and responding to that connection. Of course we focussed on technique of these items and others \u2013 pivots, ochos etc, but it was not about set sequences. Where he teaches: as others have written, his studio is charming, welcoming and nicely located in San Telmo. It has air conditioning and a view and Alejandro himself.How he teaches: always positively! There was lots of good positive reinforcement, lots of constructive comment and lots of easy acceptance of mistakes. And when the particular lesson was too challenging, he easily and quickly took it down a notch to review, build and develop. And he explains why \u2013 never does he simply say: it is simply like that because.... He takes a very precise and detailed approach to explaining why the posture is like this, why the walk is like this etc --- and over the course of the month, these little pieces all came together to form a more complete picture for me. So for those of us with different learning styles he covered it all --- explanation, demonstration, and practice! Hear it, see it, do it! Very effective and while sometimes almost more info than one can absorb, one does absorb it. Did I mention patience? He is very patient and encouraging! And he turned up at a milonga he knew I was attending to have a dance or two and, as the professional he is, to quietly assess the progress I was making on the dance floor. How\u2019s that for dedication? I had a great time in Buenos Aires and my time with Ale was the highlight. It was always so enjoyable to work with him, to be in the company of someone so passionate about what they are doing, to listen to all the \u2018sweet\u2019 music, and to be so well attended to --- not in a sugar-coated way, but in a very realistic and sensitive way that provided both encouragement and the appropriate guidance for correction and improvement. If you are seriously interested in learning tango or making improvements in your dance then I highly recommend Alejandro. Go ready to open yourself to his teaching and coaching. You won\u2019t be disappointed and you will have fun too!Stan Holman, West Vancouver, BC, Canada."

I came to BA for a week with family and thought to take a couple of tango lessons while I was there-- I've never danced tango before. Alejandro has helped me fall in love with a new art form. He treated me not like a beginner but like a dancer. He introduced me to the main principles of tango-- connection, change of weight-- and encouraged me to listen to and feel the music we danced to. He also respected the questions I had. And we did a lot of actual dancing, which was the most fun!One thing I most appreciate about Alejandro is his philosophy that the follower has a job as important as the job of the leader. In his own dancing he is often the follower, and I really believe this allows him more empathy and a more effective way to teach followers-- he knows how subtle it is to be in that role, and unlike other teachers, he does not belittle the challenge of it. As a result I felt completely empowered as a dancer.I see now how learning tango can be a lifelong love. Alejandro gave me music to listen to and was able to recommend teachers back home, since I want to continue to dance. I highly recommend the experience of working with Alejandro, whether you just want a moment of dancing tango while you visit Argentina, or you are a serious student!"

Before my first class with Alejandro, I had no previous experience with tango, or partner dancing. A clean slate.After our first session I immediately booked several more. I intuitively knew I had lucked out with a special teacher. However, I would not know exactly 'how' lucky I was until much later. I booked a class each day for the duration of my trip, which I would recommend to do if you are able.It has now been 5 months since my first class with Alejandro, and I am continuing to dance and take classes back in North America. It is interesting that almost every instructor has remarked on how strong my fundamentals are, and how well I have been taught. It has become very apparent that I have benefited greatly from learning with him.However I learned more than just technique and posture from Alejandro. More than just the tools to be stable, yet light, in my physical presence when dancing. Or how to be a considerate dance partner. Alejandro's gift in his teaching goes beyond those fundamentals.Last week I was given a message to pass on to Alejandro from a well known Argentine teacher that I studied with at a tango festival in Montreal, and I think this teacher's observation captures Alejandro's true strength very accurately. After the class, the teacher asked me to dance several times at the milonga afterwards. Later in the evening when we said goodbye, he politely apologized for asking me so often to dance, but he said that I am dancing an old style of tango that made him feel like he was back in Buenos Aires. He was very curious about how and where I learned to dance in such a traditional way. He said tango is not about knowing the most advanced steps, not about how 'pretty' it looks, but that tango is about the connection and presence, and how it feels. He asked who my teacher was, and had many questions about how I learned. He told me that he hoped I realized how fortunate I was to have been taught so well, and with such integrity. He made me promise to let Alejandro know that his teaching is appreciated, not just by me, but by him as well. He said that every teacher gives an essence of themselves to their student, and it was clear that Alejandro's was connection - true tango. He said that what I have been taught by Alejandro is more important than any step, which is the essence and heart of tango. You could not receive a greater gift to from a teacher."

I have just returned from Buenos Aires where I enjoyed the good fortune of learning tango over a number of weeks in the beautiful studio of Alejandro Puerta, an exceptionally gifted and inspirational teacher.Alejandro\u2019s website had popped up during one of many online searches. After reading just the first page of his site I felt I had found the one and my instincts were encouraged by the faultless reviews I saw here on Tripadvisor. My experience proved the validity of everything I had read. On arrival I was an eager beginner. Not at zero, I had the basic idea, but poise, fluidity, balance and connection to either my partner or the music? Not at all! I was an excited head trying to remember steps but all that was to change under Alejandro\u2019s expert tuition.From the first moment Alejandro put me at ease. There is something very light and peaceful about him that he consistently transmits through his eyes, his smile and his embrace: it fills the studio somehow and seeps into you. He explains everything articulately, suggesting images that help you grasp the ideas, planting the concepts as seeds that will surely mature and grow. His teaching is a perfect example of the self-fulfilling prophecy: he appeared to have no doubt in my ability at all and this belief managed to sweep away my own, rather stubborn and unhelpful self-doubt. The sure sign of a consummate professional, Alejandro never appeared to have an off day but was always 100% present and constantly giving his all. Each class was a richly packed experience that covered several aspects of tango. He praised, encouraged, demanded and challenged with a seemingly endless supply of patience and a brilliant sense of humour. His confidence in me, his infectious delight and excitement at any progress was utterly inspirational and spurred me on. For me, and without any hyperbole, the experience was simply life changing.Like so many city dwellers today with busy frantic lives juggling jobs, children, relationships etc., unknowingly, I had come to live mostly in my head. Somehow along the way an important part of me had closed down and I hadn\u2019t really noticed. However, during those wonderful lessons something quiet yet profound was happening on a personal level, as slowly but surely the locks around my heart were sprung, liberating and dispelling old fears, doubts and anxieties enabling a freer flow of energy throughout my body which brought a deeper peace and a truer, more honest connection that not only transformed my dancing as I finally connected with my partner and the music but so much more. Alejandro taught me so much and I made great, deeply rooted progress. Of course there is still a good deal for me to learn and perfect but by subtly facilitating my ability to connect and giving me such a solid foundation I feel he thoroughly prepared me to face any and every new challenge and adventure in the wonderful world of tango. Wherever it takes me, I know it will be fun and life enhancing and for that I will be eternally grateful to him and to tango!"

I found Alejandro online, felt impressed by his website and TripAdvisor reviews, and contacted him to set up a month of private group lessons for our total group of 10.From the very beginning of our relationship, Alejandro acted with professionalism, expertise, humor, and an exquisite eye for service. Our initial conversation via Skype convinced me that he was the real deal\u2014a tango instructor who focused on connection, not just looking good\u2014and the rate he charged was extremely fair and competitively priced against other teachers I contacted. He went out of his way to find a rental studio near my group's apartment (even if it meant a subway commute for him) and additional leaders to balance out my group's leader-follower ratio. The lessons themselves were wonderful and perfectly paced for a group of young adult novices. By the second week our group had enough skills to start attending milongas, and by the fourth week we were ripping up the dance floors. (At least, by our standards!)Many of the members of our group (myself included) were so inspired by the group classes that they took multiple private lessons with Alejandro at his beautiful studio in San Telmo.I cannot recommend Alejandro enough for group private lessons, individual private lessons, and general awesomeness. He is the Argentine Honey Badger. Thanks Alejandro."

Alejandro is a super perceptive individual, a kind and very personable instructor who knows his stuff and teaches very very effectively in a charming salon in his apartment.

He took the time to connect with both of us, explain the methodology and history of the tango, and slowly progress through the lesson. He's very patient, funny, and extremely kind. We felt very welcomed in his home and sensed love and dedication for his art. A month+ after our lesson, we find out selves tango-ing in our kitchen and think fondly of our lesson in BA.

I only spent a few days in Buenos Aires and left it almost until the end of my stay to book a class because, although I really wanted to learn some Tango basics, I was afraid it would end up being a frustrating or disappointing experience, as many other attempts at taking dance classes have been for me. But Alejandro\u2019s classes were truly fantastic! I cannot recommend him highly enough! I was skeptical to say the very least, and I always struggled just letting go and believing I could do something when it came to dancing. Alejandro really knew how to get me out of that mindset, made me feel at easy and in the few hours of classes we had I felt like we achieved a lot. I walked out feeling confident and even liberated, with better posture and with a desire to learn more about tango. Alejandro is extremely good at assessing what kind of personality he has in front of him and, instead of just showing some basic steps, he really takes these personality traits into account when teaching and when showing that tango is more than just a dance. I actually changed my plans on the day I was flying out just to squeeze one more class in. I am sure I will go back to Argentina as soon as I get the chance, and I am certain I will go back for more tango classes!"

He is very patient, gives tips and correction and makes you feel at ease and comfortable making mistakes.

His studio, right in the middle of San Telmo and a stone's throw away from the market is in a great location and the studio is sunny and beautiful.I'd warned Alejandro that I wasn't a very good dancer, but his method of teaching: of connecting and being present took away all my doubts and fears about being able to tango. In just three lessons we were dancing using several different dance movements. He is a remarkable teacher. Extremely supportive (I lived for the little \"muy bien!\"s I received when I followed him correctly, or when he tried new things and I was able to navigate them) and kind and open. It would not be an exaggeration to say that I changed as a person after taking lessons from Alejandro. Learning to tango, while difficult for me because I tend to be a stressed out, over-thinker, was liberating for me. It allowed me to focus just on the dancing, and how the dancing felt. I loved every second of it.Taking three lessons from Alejandro wasn't enough. I wish I'd had enough time for 5 or 6 lessons, but I think that wouldn't have been enough either.

It\u2019s very easy for me to recommend Alejandro, as he\u2019s a terrific teacher who has helped me start to understand what makes tango tick. Without him, I\u2019d still be outside the music, appreciative but distant. Thanks to our classes, I\u2019m starting to really feel a connection with tango.I know that Ale has students of all levels, but this review will focus on how well he guides beginners, since that\u2019s me all over. I spend a lot of time in Buenos Aires and had always appreciated tango music, but had never danced a step.Ale teaches from a bright and cheerful studio in San Telmo, where he creates an atmosphere that is welcoming, relaxed, and non-judgmental. Now, tango is not something you master in a few classes, but right from the start, Ale was able to help me understand the \u201cwhy\u201d of tango rather than just the \u201chow.\u201d He never gave me steps to simply mimic. Instead, he gradually explained the key concepts of balance, posture, connection, and musicality. Tango is really a philosophy as much as it is a dance, and I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface, but I\u2019m so glad that I started here, with Alejandro, rather than in a class (like a couple I\u2019ve since tried in New York) where the focus is on learning steps and intricate patterns, rather than understanding what you\u2019re doing and why you\u2019re doing it. Like all good teachers, Ale is extremely sensitive to his student\u2019s strengths and weakness. He has a strong intuitive sense of when to push and when to praise. If you\u2019re even a little bit curious about dancing tango, I can\u2019t imagine a better introduction."

During a short 5 day visit to Argentina recently,my wife and I, along with our female friend who was travelling with us, decided that being in Buenos Aires, it would make sense to experience in some small way the unique cultural experience that is tango. After browsing Tripadvisor and determining that spending big pesos to see a splashy show wasn't our thing, we came across the idea of trying to arrange a lesson, followed by a trip to observe at a Milonga, where tango is pursued by locals who love it.The manager of the vacation rental where we were staying happened to know of an instructor in the San Telmo area, which is how we were referred to AlejandroNow, being one of the worst dancers I know, you might question my ability to judge who is, and who is not, a great instructor. That's probably a fair comment, but what I can say is that Alejandro was very patient and understanding, and managed in a very short time to teach us enough of the basics, as well as the unique etiquette involved in being at a Milonga, to give us at least a start in appreciating this fascinating area of dance.Plus, he never laughed at me once, something I can't say of my wife that evening. And all of this at a cost that was a small fraction of what we could have paid at the splashy show.All of us agreed that our evening with Alejandro was time and money well spent."

He just adapdet everything to my personal needs, for example the time of the lesson, the duration, the procession and the speed. With his professional instructions i always felt highly motivated and so increased a lot during our shared time. The place and atmosphere are beautiful as his character is and I will miss both of them."

I decided to take a lesson with Alejandro on the recommendation of another woman I met in my neighborhood; little did I know that I would end up taking lessons almost daily from Alejandro over the course of my stay. I cannot recommend him enough. I really feel like I learned to tango fairly well and to understand the spirit of tango (it's better than therapy!). Alejandro is such a wonderful, kind, respectful person that I immediately felt comfortable with him. Truly, my days spent taking classes with Alejandro are among some of the best of my life."

            "review": "Soul of Tango. For those who want, even in a short period of time, to probe the depth and complexity of tango, Alejandro's classes are the answer. We only had time for two classes, but in them we came to understand something of the music of tango and, most importantly, the posture, the grace of movement and depth of emotion that makes the dance what it is. \"Be honest with me!\" Alejandro insists. And while I didn't feel that I yet knew enough about what I was doing to be either honest or dishonest, I understood that what he was trying to convey was the expressive soul of the dance.  In addition to lessons, I highly recommend taking Alejandro along for a guide when going to your first milonga. He accompanied us to an early evening event at the Galician community center, a remarkable experience we would never have managed on our own. Here, the women sit on one side and men on the other, and, as Alejandro explained, exchange coded signals before the man advances to the women's side, she stands, and they grip each other in what appears to be the most passionate of embraces. Then, as Alejandro explained, protocol required that the partners stay together through the stages of the dance, stopping to chat amiably between numbers. Though I had seen a lot of tango movies and so had not entirely believed Alejandro when he told us somewhat firmly, \"It's not about sex,\" I came to feel that what he said was true; the dancers were experiencing some other kind of connection that I still don't quite grasp, but that, without Alejandro, I would never have even glimpsed."

            "review": "Superb tango experience - instruction, history, music and dancing. I moved to Buenos Aires to live for 5 months last year. Being a salsa dancer, it was high on my agenda to learn tango to gain an appreciation for this dance that is so entwined with the history of Buenos Aires. I sought out and tried several recommended instructors in the city. Alejandro stood head and shoulders beyond any other instructor that I met. His teaching methodology, his elegant dancing ability, his love of the music and history, his ability to get you dancing gracefully and confidently in a seemingly short amount of time amazed not only me, but the numerous other people to whom I had recommended Alejandro. I was also able to attend a few milongas with Alejandro during my time there during which he introduced me to the culture and etiquette of tango, something that many instructors don't bother teaching or even mentioning. For me, this was an intriguing part of the immersion into the past and present of the dance and its history in this grand city. Whether you are a complete beginner at tango, an aficionado or an advanced dancer, I would highly recommend taking classes with Alejandro. He is fluent in English, Spanish, Japanese and all things tango-related. Don't miss the chance to experience a major part of the history and culture of Buenos Aires. Take some tango lessons and go to a practica or milonga where beginners are welcomed. Buena suerte!"

I took a couple friends who were visiting me in BA. They absolutely loved it and we actually ran into a couple other folks there that were recommended Argentina Polo Day by a friend who had visited me and gone before.

I enjoyed it immensely and had the opportunity to learn how to play and participate later in the afternoon.If you think POLO is easy to play, guess again. It is more challenging and you need the horse to be your best friend.You need to make this a must on your trip as I will be back the next time I come there.Michael"

So - after making your list for BA - Recoleta, Teatro Colon, Ateneo, Fuerza Bruta, MALBA, historical sites, parques, maybe tango...lots of food, you need to add Argentina Polo Day! This was SO MUCH FUN! I love visiting BA, but wanted to break up our week with a trip to the country. I had to choose between a trip to an estancia or Argentina Polo Day. I chose Argentina Polo Day because of the great reviews and because I felt it would be nice to actually \"do\" something as opposed to walking and sitting and eating. What a great choice! I still get kudos from the fam. I am in my 50's traveling with my husband and 19-year-old son. Together, we've been on horses - maybe 6 times, so we are novices. The experience was delightful. We were driven to a polo club in the country where we learned about polo - who knew? and actually rode horses and actually played polo (albeit in a smaller area!) The wine flowed freely. The food was delicious. The teaching was excellent. Every interaction was upbeat and friendly. So, we learned something new, we got some exercise, we enjoyed meeting new people and we got to share this experience as a family.As you can see, I cannot recommend this highly enough. So, go ahead a sign up! On another note - it was refreshing to work with a company that was friendly and accommodating. (As you will see, or may soon know, the concept of 'customer service' is inconsistently applied in Argentina.) With so much trip planning, I messed up with respect to payment options and Argentina Polo Day figured out a solution and was very kind and everything worked out."

It's a perfect way to break up the city time and see the \"provincia,\" get the classic \"campo\" experience, learn about the culture, and get some exercise. Enjoy!!"

Our group of six were definitely skeptical going in to this, but Argentina polo day was the best part of our stay in Buenos Aires.Wine is close at hand during all parts of the trip. The ranch is gorgeous. The food is excellent and plentiful. Pablo and the other instructors are extremely nice and make you feel like a pro even though you have no clue what you're doing.

We drove out to the ranch and were greeted with wine and empanadas! After having a snack we headed outside to watch a polo game! We got to throw the ball onto the field to start the game, ring the bell to end it, meet the horses and players, and learn about the rules of polo. After the game, we went inside for an amazing lunch. Lunch consisted of more wine (because wine not?), grilled vegetables and lots of different grilled meats including sausage and steak. After lunch we learned how to play polo! I had never ridden a horse before, but the instructor was great at showing me how to ride and then eventually actually hit the balls! By the end we were playing an actual polo match! In the summertime, you can relax by the pool after polo, but I was there in the winter so we went back inside by the fire and ate some dessert. This really was a perfect day!"

My wife and I, her sister, and our two children, ages 9 and 11 all had an experience we will remember for years to come. Well worth the cost and time. It was an all day event where we all learned the game of Polo by not only watching club members play the game, but also had instruction on the basics. When we arrived they met us with wine, coffee and empanadas, I think I ate 8 empanadas. We then watched a very good game of Polo played by the club members. Most notable was that along with the five of us, there was one other person on the trip that day and the organizers were able to get all of us on horses after an INCREDIBLE lunch and play a game of Polo. I have not been on a horse since I was 10 (I'm 44 now) and my kids had not rode before either. We all had a great time. The staff that runs the place were all friendly and extremely gracious.I've been fortunate to travel to many places with my family and we've done some great adventures. Argentina Polo Day stands as one of the most memorable, best organized events we've ever participated in on a family vacation."

The polo day was the highlight of my stay in Buenos Aires, it was so much funPicked up around 10, we were taken with 4 other guests to a ranch about an hour outside of the city. On arrival, we were told to relax by the lovely fire in the lounge (it was a cold day) and offered empanadas and red wine.Then we were taken to a small polo field to watch a game between some players to get an understanding of the game and a brief introduction to the rules. At breaks in the game we were shown how to hold the mallet, hit the ball and taken to see some of the horses taking part.A delicious lunch followed (either meat or veggie), more red wine and coffee and then it was time to put theory into action as we donned our polo gear and played a game. The guys are in the arena with you to help and you get plenty of practice on the horse before the game starts.We all had a terrific time, getting a great sense of accomplishment when hitting the ball! After the match we stayed on the horses for a trot around the grounds followed by a scrumptious dessert (and more wine).Highly recommended no matter if you've never ridden a horse before. They'll take care of you."

We did the complete day tour. Our pick-up was on time, clean and comfortable; transfer was about an hour. The estancia, which doubles as polo club and small hotel, is absolutely gorgeous. It feels like a completely different world just a skip away from the city. Upon arrival we were greeted with hot meat empanadas fresh off the grill and a healthy glass of Malbec. Pablo, our guide/polo instructor, was fantastic. He was funny and informative and totally knew how to calm me down when my horse got a little \u201cexcited\u201d during our polo match later in the afternoon.The overall program\u2026 We spent the morning sipping Malbec and listening to Pablo explain the tradition of polo in Argentina and the rules of the game, all while watching members of the Corona Polo Club play a friendly game of four chukkers. We also hit a few practice balls (off horse) to get ready for the game in the afternoon. We then had a lovely asado (lunch) with the players, Pablo, the owner and horsehands; all of whom were very warm, welcoming and friendly. After lunch we then had a chance to play ourselves. Tito was my practice partner who patiently continued the ball for me when I would miss it completely or grow a little weary in the wrist. After a bit of practice we all played a short game which really made my husband and I appreciate the skill of the game. (We were terrible.) We then ended the afternoon more glasses of Malbec, a delicious tiramisu and transfer back to Buenos Aires. It really was a lovely day and something you will not really experience anywhere else. A must if you are in Buenos Aires!"

Recommendations- I recommend going with a smaller group if possible. We were there with two other ladies and it was perfect. - I recommend wearing/bringing rain boots to ride with (or boots you do not care about). We went when it was pouring down rain and very muddy). Despite the rain we still had a good time. Areas to improve:- The car that collected us was a 2 door car for 5 people (the driver, +me and my husband, +2 other individuals). It was a very small and could have been very awkward. Luckily we were with 2 other great people, but still very tight for over and hour to the facility and over an hour back.

Where to begin?We truly did not know what to expect when the bus came to pick us up at the hotel in the morning...but our friend who recommended this excursion deemed it a \"MUST\" - and we now absolutely agree! Wow, what a day.Connie, our amazing guide, picked us up in a bus and we took a nice drive to the country. Once we arrived, we were immediately handed a glass of Malbec and a warm empanada fresh off the parrilla (I had two and half of my father's...they were so delicious!). We then walked out to the polo field area on the sprawling green estate that had a little resident dog that was so friendly. Ruben, one of the owners of the estate kindly lent me a sweater because I was a little chilly.We were seated on the bleachers facing the polo field, offered more wine and refreshments, and Connie explained the game of polo to us. The players came out on the field, and we were able to watch a match and knock the ball around ourselves in between each chukker. After the game ended, our group suited up, got on the horses and played a polo game! Not easy! But the horses were sweet, and each team had a pro to assist in moving the game along.By the end, we were exhausted, laughing and HUNGRY.Of course the parrilla was already fired up, and they served us an amazing meal with more wine, amazing Argentinian meat, grilled vegetables, and chocolate cake because it was someone's birthday! At that point, the group felt comfortable and relaxed and it was truly nice to celebrate someone - as a friend, not just a stranger.As we ate outside under a roof, it started to drizzle ever so slightly, and it became such a perfect moment. It was like out of a dream. Ruben and Celia, the owners, collect artifacts that outfit their beautiful and rustic home there. It was very cool to see some Argentinian history as well.At the end, we were sad to leave. Back on the buses we went, back to our lives.I most certainly would love to return, and even do an extended stay.Connie and others took so many photos throughout and they send you a link on Facebook afterwards, which is amazing so you can look back on the incredible day with new friends.I cannot recommend Argentina Polo Day enough.

They conveniently pick you up where you're staying in the city, you arrive to wine and empanadas, you're on a beautiful countryside property watching a polo match, you learn about polo and the horses, drink more wine, have a delicious asada bbq on a long table overlooking the green landscape, and then you're on the horses, getting comfortable with riding and play a 'kiddie version' of polo with other attendees. If the weather is nice, you can hop in their pool after the match! So much fun. Great instruction. Celia and her family and staff are so warm and welcoming! Full disclosure, I've never been too comfortable on a horse and my husband doesn't have much riding experience, but we had so much fun and everyone was able to take their time on the horses at their own speed -- I really appreciated this. The horses are so well trained and really responsive, and the Polo Day team is riding alongside the group helping everyone out and taking photos of your day. Do this. It will surely be a highlight of your time in BA!"

We stumbled on Polo Day, and boy were we lucky. It is a fantastic day. I am a cattle rancher, and assumed Polo Day would be like riding a pony at the carnival. It is not. They feed you a great meal, they explain the game, gladly answer all questions, watch a game. Then you hop on a horse. Get on the field. They throw out a bunch of balls. Practice for an hour. Then we played a 30 min game. The pros playing with us were great help and a ton of fun. YOU HAVE TO GO TO POLO DAY IF YOU ARE IN BsAs!!"

I went with my husband and 2 daughters - ages 16 and 13. Hands down we all voted this outing our favorite day on vacation. The property is beautiful and the day is spaced quite well: snack, explanation of the game, watch a game, practice in between periods, lunch, and then play yourself. The lunch was fantastic - beef, red wine, grilled veggies - so fresh and just the best! I didn't think we'd all be able to manage playing on horses, but the fact that we all did and loved it speaks for itself. Our guide (Pablo) was wonderful and witty and our group was small - just our family and 2 other couples. Plan for a full day - the drive was about 1 hour from where we stayed in Palermo; we got picked up around 10am and returned at 7:30pm."

Next we watched a polo game, then had lunch (very good!!), and played our own game of polo! Some of the people we were with had no experience on horses, and all went well! At the end of the day, you are welcome to use their pool. They have changing rooms and showers available as well. Also, they have rooms available if you wish to stay over night! I wish I would have known that prior to booking because I would have loved to have stayed! The only thing we didn't really like was that we were picked up at our hotel in a very small vehicle. We were traveling with 2 large American men, so it made for an uncomfortable start and end to our day."

I booked online through the website a day in advance. We were staying at an Air BNB in Palermo Soho and were picked up at a nearby hotel for the 40ish minute ride. This whole process was seamless. There were solo travelers, couples and groups. We arrived to the beautiful grounds and were immediately handed glasses of wine and parrilla before walking over to the field. The whole day was very organized. Our \"leader\" Fabio was extremely knowledgable and kind. After learning the rules of the game, watching a match, eating, drinking more and practicing we got on our horses. The horses were so well kept and easy to ride. I think I had the most fun just trotting around the field. The game was fun and I scored a goal but the mallet got very heavy after a while (I'm a 130 pound female). This was the type of day I didn't want to end and definitely the highlight of our 11 day trip in Buenos Aires."

The horses were standing still trying to avoid facing the heavy rain but still nobody from the farm reacted to bring us in but they startet to Hit the horses with the polo stick while my friend, A beginner, was still sitting on the horse.Then we were heading under some trees to Cover from the Rain. All the beginners had to make their own way - on some spooked horses, because our guide was already under the trees seeking shelter from the heavy rain. We were absolutely not taken good care of and felt not save. Not even the experienced riders in our Group.We can just recommend to save your money and time and better spent some time with well kept and better treated horses on an estancia that is a bit more individual, not Mass-market-tourist-trap Kind of activity."

I had a few days in Buenos Aires, but after a couple of days of tours and eating an excessive amount of steak, I was looking for something a bit unique. Polo Day scratched that itch.Not only can you not do something like this in the States, the setting is beautiful, the food is excellent, and it's really just a fun time. A great way to relax, perhaps at the end of a trip.Quick heads up/tips & tricks when booking:- Book by messaging them on WhatsApp, they're very responsive- Don't be freaked out when they ask to meet at a random hotel and you're picked up in an unmarked van, with no explanation in the van of what's going to happen (sidenote to Polo Day: You may want to do an intro/overview when you start driving to explain the day and how long the ride will be)- The ride takes about an hour- You're back in BA ~7pm, which is perfect for cleaning up and going back out (you'll sleep on the ride back)Everyone here was extremely friendly and I'm still in shock that they get people who've never been on a horse before playing low level Polo. Tons of fun. Would definitely do again."

The horses are very well trained and we felt safe. our only negative thoughts were that we were picked up in the morning in a very dilapidated minivan and the journey wasn't particularly comfortable as most of the seats appeared to be broken and I don't think there was any suspension whatsoever! The ride back was in a different van and was much better. The information we received indicated we would be back at hotel by 7pm but we didn't arrive back until 8pm so don't make any dinner reservations just in case!

We got the full gear, the instruction, the horses and the game but can we call this 'playing'? Yes we can because we enjoyed it very mum and discovered that hitting a ball on a horse at full speed takes some skills. Anyhow, good fun! All other details you can find in the other reviews."

My day started off with being the first passenger picked up at my hotel by Pablo Fazzari ( an Argentinian hunk!). He was enthused and energetic which was infectious so I started becoming more and more excited about the Polo excursion. We picked up about 6 more passengers and then headed to the countryside of Pilar, which is about a 45 minutes commute from Buenos Aires. Once we arrived on the property you could tell how manicured and beautiful the ranch is. They treated us so well when we arrived that it almost felt as if we arrived to a family friends house. Pablo took us to the field and started teaching us about Polo. He was charismatic and funny as he went over all the details. He had the whole group laughing. Our wine glass were never empty and they made it a point to make sure we all were comfortable and having the best time. After seeing a few matches, we went on the field to practice hitting the ball. We played a game to see who could hit the ball with the bell, we all had fun. The day was just beginning! We went back to the picnic area to have lunch. WHAT A FEAST!!! More delicious food kept coming and coming. You will not starve in their presence, elite hospitality. After our food digested it was time to play Polo!! The horses are very sweet and very trained. I didn\u2019t feel scared or worried. Everyone there are professionals and are attentive to you at all times. We jumped on our horses and attempted to play Polo. I have such respect for the game now, it is not easy but it was exciting to do. We played for awhile. It is an experience I will never forgot and as a matter of fact, I want to do it again in the city I live (Los Angeles). After a workout with the Polo match we all changed and jumped inside this beautiful pool they have on the property. Like I said, it felt as if I was at a friends house. While we are all swimming, we were pleasantly surprised with some delicious Sangria and a bowl of fresh fruit. Life was tough, HA! After our nice swim we headed back to Buenos Aires. I could go on and on about this experience. This by far is one of the most memorable excursion I have ever experience. Pablo took so many pictures of us to capture our moments. He went above and beyond in making this a wonderful experience for the group. I do not believe anyone else could have done it better than Pablo! The Polo players were great too. We got to meet and interact with all of them. Such delightful people. I was very impressed with the female Polo player, Tete; she is just as good or better than the men! Very encouraging. I am want to thank Celia Alfie, from team Argentina Polo Day, who was so diligent with getting our photos up on the website as fast as she did. Thank you, Pablo and Team Argentina Polo Day, for an incredible experience. A++++++++++++++++++Your very grateful passenger (January 15, 2016)Christina Mendez, Los Angeles, California"

To be fair we were not galloping around, for most of the group the horses were walking and sometimes trotting, but it was enormous fun, especially when we got competitive. And we really got to understand the game so much better. But I should start at the beginning. We were picked up from our apartment at 10:00 by Cony and driven to the polo ground near Pilar. She was great fun and full of information about Buenos Aires, Argentina and polo. At the polo ground we had empanadas and drinks and then went to watch a real game and learn the rules and try playing on foot. Then we had lunch. The food was fantastic. Grilled steak and vegetables, the best we had had. And wine, of course. Then we got kitted out (they gave us chaps, helmets, mallets) and got our horses. There were only three people in the tour and each of us had someone on a horse behind us hitting the ball into position for us to hit. Once we got the hang of it we played the competitive game in half a field. What a buzz! We played with Manuel who had played with Prince Harry - star struck! After the game, hot and sweaty, we had a swim and sangria to cool off. We got home around 7:00 pm. Tips: book direct with Celia - it is cheaper. Cash only. Bring jeans, covered shoes, swimwear and towel."

We then watched members of the club play a match while we continued to eat, drink and meet the other members sharing our experience. We indulged in a barbecue lunch which was beautiful, then were selected ponies for our own attempt at polo. Despite having prior horse riding experience, it was quite a challenge but so much fun! We then cooled off by the pool, drank sangria and ate fruit. It was such a wonderful day, worth every penny!"

This applied to my partner and myself so I did some investigating and found this particular estancia highly rated. WOW! It wasn't overstated at all.Everyone involved was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The location is beautiful and everything is done to ensure your enjoyment and safety. The lunch was fabulous, polo match exciting and then you get on a horse and play a match! I have been riding all my life and my partner just a few times. We both equally enjoyed the match, as did the others that came out this day. After your polo match you are taken to an absolutely beautiful pool where you get to cool down and relax. The day couldn't have ended more perfectly. The only requirements are long pants and proper footwear (sandals aren't a good idea). Sunscreen is a must during their summer months as you are out there in the brilliant sunshine and it is impossible not to get warm while trying to score goals for your team."

He did a great job explaining polo in a nutshell and taught us how to hit the ball. The welcoming snacks- empanadas were AMAZING, the best I ever had in Argentina. After a meaty lunch, we started to get on the horse and practiced a little bit. Because of our small group size, we have 1 on 1 coach shadowing us on the practice. (+100 points on this. You learned quicker with someone at your side.) Then we did the competition. It was really fun. Highly recommend it. Celia was responsive throughout the booking and communicating the logistics. There's nothing I'd complain about. Purely incredible."

The hotel pickup was as planned. Our guide, Pablo (aka Poli) for the day was not only engaging, he was a very good horseman/polo player. Our fellow travelers were a fun, energetic, and adventurous group. The facility is absolutely gorgeous, clean, well organized. We were greeted with freshly baked empanadas from an open fire oven. We were educated about the game and its rules. We watched an exhibition match of experienced players. We practiced hitting balls on the ground. Then a beautiful lunch of grilled meats and vegetables was served with fresh salad and good red wine. Next we suited up and chose teams with jerseys and protection provided by the staff. Feeling brave and determined we mounted our horses, we were each given a ball with which to practice. Our horses were very well trained, responding quickly to each command. After practice we played a mini match on a reduced size field. We wore ear to ear smiles all day. I'm still amazed at this organization's ability to take 14 complete beginners, and within a few hours, have them on horseback actually playing the game. I say..don't hesitate, DO THIS!!!!"

We were greeted with delicious empanadas, for me they had chorizo sausage & fresh herbed tomato (gluten free). Which I loved. The drinks, wine, juice, water flowed freely all day. They cooked a BBQ for those who were staying the full day. They are small groups, we had only 7. There's a pool right next to the polo field, change rooms, with showers and toilets are there as well.It was a terrific day we learnt and watched a sport we had no experience or knowledge about.

We watched a polo match, had a delicious lunch with so much food and more wine with a great bunch of people and most had no horse experience. First we got to practice with our feet firmly on the ground and learnt a bit about the sport then it was time to mount up! We got to practice and get to know our ponies then it was time for a game it was so much fun and everyone was having a great time and at no point did I feel unsafe or scared of my horse. Once we finished our game we were straight into the pool, fed more and more drinks. It was a full day we left at 9.30am and got back to the hotel about 8.30pm.

We were picked up right on time and taken to these beautiful polo fields. Wine and empanadas were handed to us immediately. Learning about the game, watching an actual match and actually playing the game ourselves was such, such fun! Plus, the absolutely delicious asado under the trees on such a beautiful day was FANTASTIC! My sister, 21 year old nephew and I enjoyed the experience with a group from all over the world and it made for great and hilarious conversation. The host, Pablo, was the BEST, being very knowledgeable with an awesome sense of humor!! I can not recommend this experience enough!!!"

After spending a week at La Carona with Ruben, Celia and their team, playing daily with polo pro Jose Lezcano, I was playing four full chukkars! The polo team took great care to match me with the right horses and played to my ability while also elevating my game. I had the chance to meet and play with different members of the polo club and loved sitting down to daily huge lunches of steak and wine with everyone after the games. And perhaps the best part of the experience was waking up everyday on the farm, ready to play. Truly an exceptional experience and I really look forward to a return trip."

You could take the experience as fast or slow as you needed and the guide Paulo aka. the Brad Pitt of Latin America :-) was kind, caring, fun, informative. All of the staff was so accommodating you didn't want to leave. AND...the food...O...the food!!!! One of the best meals in the country. The empanadas were my favorite of the whole trip and they placed such a beautiful spread for lunch we were definitely spoiled by the end. If you do anything in the Argentinian countryside choose this...it's a once and lifetime experience."

I had hardly been on a horse in my life but at the age of 64 felt confident to ride which is a testament to the quality and behavior of the horses. I took to it with ease and scored three goals feeling I could go on all day!!

We found Argentina Polo Day and it was the best decision we could have made. We were picked up right on time from our apartment rental in Palermo Hollywood and taken to the countryside. On the drive we made great conversation and upon our arrival were fed delicious empanadas and explained the basics of polo as well as our day's agenda. From there we went to the Polo fields which were incredible to see. Watching members play was thrilling, especially since there were some former professional players among them. We were involved as spectators and learning how to swing on the sidelines. The asada for lunch was one of the best meals we had in all of Argentina. Finally came our turn to get on horses which is when the real fun started. As 3 Americans who have barely ridden horses, that was the main challenge. After a half hour or so, we got the hang of it and played a small game. This was thrilling and exciting (trying not to fall off the horse) at the same time, an incredible experience I wouldn't change at all. After tiring ourselves out we were taken back to the \"clubhouse\" for coffee and desert. Here we were treated like family. Overall it was an incredible experience and the service, instruction and amenities were top class. Highly recommended."

The place is stunning and the agenda well executed. We were welcomed with a warm fire, wine, and snack. The food the whole day was delicious and we were never left wanting. The people there were all wonderful and made us feel at home. Everyone ate together family style at lunch, and as I went alone, I really appreciated the sense of community. I also had no prior polo experience but was completely at ease all day. The instructors were very effective in describing the history of the sport, rules, and tips.

On all trips I like to do something out of my normal comfort zone of sightseeing and being a lover of all sports I chose this as my activity for the trip. The staff is incredibly attentive and helpful. I was taught how to ride a horse while it was galloping. Which I hadn't done before because most of my horse experiences have been on group tours that are very touristy. It is an immersion of polo culture in Argentina which is huge. Since our trip was in September it was cold so the pool part wasn't really feasible but we were so tired from polo we just chatted with some wine by the fireplace and it was great!!! "

From making initial enquiries to the end of the day itself, Juan, Celia and the rest of the team were amazing and created what turned out to be a highlight of my entire trip. You get picked up from your hotel and driven about 1 hour outside of BA to their stunning polo ranch, and are immediately greeted with wine and empanadas. After learning a bit about the game, we were able to watch a match of 4 chukkas with some ex-pro players. Juan makes sure to keep you involved at every stage, by ringing the bell, or throwing in the ball. In between in chukka you practise with the mallet and get to know the horses. Afterwards we had a really good lunch (typical Argentine grill) and some more wine, after which you definitely feel more confident about playing polo yourself! Once matched up with your horse, you first spend some time riding, then practise with a mallet and a ball and a mounted helper (one of the players) who will follow behind you and feed you balls. The horses were all fantastic and incredibly responsive. Then we got to play our own match with some of the players which was great fun. Afterwards, I was allowed to continue to ride for a while, before we headed back to the city. The team were all so friendly and welcoming throughout the entire day and it was evident how much they all enjoy running the operation. The only thing I would say is that although they say that you don't need any riding experience, unless you are really confident I would suggest that you wouldn't get as much out of the day compared to someone who was a more experienced rider. A lack of polo experience really is not an issue however. All in all it was a fantastic day out of BA and I would urge anyone remotely interested to sign up!"

When we got there we were welcomed with wine and empanadas, while a professional polo player demonstrated the equipment and gear for the horse and the player. We watched a game played by professional player, talk to the players and took pictures with them and the horses during the intermissions. After the game we enjoyed an amazing asado while tasting excellent red wines. After lunch we got a polo lesson, did stick and ball and were able to get on the horses and play a game. I\u2019ll recommend Argentina Polo Day to anyone interested in having the real Argentinean Polo Experience\u2026 looking forward to go back next time we visit Argentina."

I visited Argentina Polo Day a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it so I decided to come back again on my recent stay.Celia tried to make everything possible from the start and replied really fast which made booking and everything really easy. On the farm all of the staff was very welcoming and the food was great! What I enjoyed most was first watching the polo match and then to actually try it myself. Since I am riding at home too, it was so much fun.. and I am thinking about an extended stay on the farm to learn more. Ruben and all the others have been great hosts and it was worth every penny to go there again."

I wasn't 100% sure what to expect but I was really keen to learn a little about Polo so booked this day trip with Argentina Polo Day. From my very first contact with them, Celia was amazing, super helpful and really quick to respond. As I am a solo traveller I needed to tag along with another group and Celia made sure I was kept informed as to when there were other bookings I could join. You are picked up from your accommodation (at a very sensible time, after 10am) and driven to the Polo Club about 50 minutes from central BA. The surroundings and scenery at the Club are beautiful. Our guide, Juan, along with the staff at the Club were all very welcoming, friendly and extremely informative. The wine started flowing as soon as we got out of the car, which is always a welcome sight to me, and didn't stop flowing all day! Fresh, tasty empanadas off the BBQ along with the history and rules of Polo delivered by Juan was first on the agenda and then a Polo game followed by an amazing lunch. After lunch we got to have a go ourselves, which was great fun. I have never been on a horse but was carefully instructed and guided by the staff and loved it!Although it was a beautiful, sunny day it was still winter, so it wasn't warm enough to take advantage of the swimming pool but it would be very inviting on a hot day!The pace of the day is just right, very relaxed but you seem to pack a lot in. I highly recommend this, it's a great day out."

We booked in pretty late but they were very accommodating and it was a fun day overall. We were picked up from our hostel, and shown an introductory video in the minivan. The first part of the day involved learning a bit about polo and watching a game between the club members. They got us involved right from the beginning by letting us do the throw-ins and having us undertake in activities during the chukkers. After their game, we learnt how to ride horses and then play our own game of polo. We were well supervised at all times so safety was never a concern. The lunch that was provided was great with plenty of vegetarian options. They also made sure that our wine glasses were always topped up, with helped give me some courage to get on the horses. The only downside for me, which was beyond Argentina Polo Day's control, was that it was off-season and it had been raining the previous day so the game that we watched was just a friendly game between the club members on the smaller field."

After an absence of two years we returned to Celia's and Ruben's fantastic Polo grounds for a whole day of polo experience. We had kept the memory of our first visit in our minds but this visit was even better: The horses were sweet and for me, a nervous rider, easy to ride. Ruben BBQ was heroic and the Empanadas so tasty! We believe we know a bit more about polo after our first PoloDay, so we felt smug in \"helping\" first-timers. The Swimming pool was lovely after all that \"hard polo work\"!Everybody was just as helpful and friendly as we remembered and we have made plans to go again next year!"

Our pickup arrived early to our hotel and drove us to the \"country club\" about an hour away. The facility itself is very basic (not like any country club I've visited), but everything else about this place is wonderful. We started with wine and snacks and were entertained by our instructor. We proceeded to the big polo field to watch an exhibition match by actual polo players who were quite skilled. After the match, we returned to the club area and had an incredible feast of grilled meats, salad and more wine. We were then instructed in the basics of polo and riding techniques. Amazingly, we were then entrusted to pick out our horses and play our own match (albeit at a very close pace). This is an experience you would never get in the States where liability concerns would be HUGE given the combination of alcohol and horse riding by unskilled amateurs swinging wooden mallets. In Argentina, however, all of these things combined for an incredibly fun day. At its conclusion, our ride dropped us off at the airport to fly to Mendoza, our next stop on the trip. Couldn't have been easier or better."

My girlfriend and I visited BA last week and were looking for some things to do outside of the normal sights, and I must say this place delivered fantastically. It was hands down, the best day in Buenos Aires. We actually called at the last minute and the owner of the ranch was incredibly helpful in securing us a ride from our hotel in Recoletta to the ranch about 45 minutes outside of the city the same day we called (included in price). Once we arrived, we were greeted like long lost friends. The two owners (a husband and wife) and their workers were nothing short of spectacular and genuine hosts the whole day. They fed us with steak and wine like my grandmother would, not taking no for an answer. (In America, I rarely eat red meat, but decided for the trip to indulge. This was by far the best steak I had on the trip.) The day was very well planned with a get to know you in the morning, followed by a polo match to watch, a family like sit-down lunch, a few polo lessons in the afternoon, and then a fun little match to close out the day. The people with us that day were also so friendly, so I feel like that added to the relaxed atmosphere. What with their daughter running around and their 10 new puppies chasing her, the atmosphere of the place was idyllic. Kind of like you were long lost friends from another country.My tip to anyone thinking of going would be:Yes, it's an expensive day, but everything is taken care for. If you can pay in dollars ahead of time, it's a better deal. Don't expect a professional match with spectators and what not. I believe the people playing polo are professionals, but they meet up like you would meet up for golf at this polo club. It's not like a league. But unless you are a serious follower of polo, it doesn't matter - the competition was good.Also, the polo playing is a bit more difficult than you would expect. But if you can physically handle it, try it. It's tons of fun. If you can't, just watch!... or just parade around on the horses without trying to hit a little ball with a mallet.I would highly recommend this to anyone just looking to enjoy a relaxed day of doing something different with a bunch of people at the ranch who take pride in what they do and who genuinely just want to have a good time with you. Thanks so much Ruben Celia and team for the best day in Buenos Aires!!"

It didn't take long for the wine to follow. Great morning watching the polo match and learning polo basics. Lunch was very good. Not much to eat if you're a vegetarian, but steak is my favorite animal so I was in heaven. :-) Meat was tender, albeit a little fatty around the edges, but there was plenty to go around. Dessert seemed like it was canned fruit, but it was refreshing after all the meat and wine. We mounted up after lunch and actually played a polo game. Riding time was about 1.5-2 hours. The horses are fairly tame for the most part and can tell when they have an experienced or inexperienced rider. I felt very safe riding around, but this wasn't my first time riding. A few members of the group rode during the practice time but didn't participate in the game. Everyone had a great time, and I'm sure it was hilarious watching us try to play. Thanks to Rueban, Poly, and Celia for a great day! This is a great tour. It's definitely more expensive than a day trip to an estancia, but you get LOTS of wine and food and much more riding time here."

We were both a little bit nervous about learning how to play polo, given we each had minimal riding experience but as soon as we arrived, I knew the day would be stress-free and totally fun. We immediately felt welcome and at home as we arrived at the polo club.

The day was a perfect mix between leisure time, watching polo, and riding. Learning to play polo was more fun than I could have ever anticipated! The instructors made sure that each of the members of the group were comfortable on the horse and spent ample individual time helping us to hone our polo skills before beginning our match. The match was hands down one of the highlights of my trip! You truly do get to try out your polo skills in an environment that is totally judgment-free and ends up being hilarious (at least in our case). I highly highly recommend booking an experience with Argentina Polo Day if you can fit it into your trip!"

For a rider like me with 2 years experience only in arena and trekking before, polo gives you more challenge with both you and your horse. For those who adore horse but without any experience, it's also a perfect opportunity to get to know them and having fun on your first ride. Start from the very beginning Celia was being very friendly and professional, reply my question rapidly.

We didn't know how much we would really get to experience a polo game, since anyone can participate in this tour regardless of riding experience. We were pleasantly surprised. We were given an introduction to the game, the rules, the equipment, the horses then we got to watch a real game (because this is a polo club). During the breaks between the chuckers we got to practice hitting the ball from the ground. Most of the people in our group hadn't ridden more than 1 or 2 times, but when it was time to ride, everyone had a good time. Even though the game moved slowly, mostly at a walk, it was still fun. And those that had some riding experience could get their horses to trot and canter. It was A BLAST! We wanted to do the whole thing again but the day we scheduled was rained out. Thanks for the great memories Pablo and crew!"

Then you watch as a game is played...Next, settle down to a grilled meal (again, another Argentinean staple)...then you get on horses and play polo. It's by no means good polo, or fast-moving polo...but it's exhilarating none-the-less.If I had to criticize, I'd say the grilled meats at lunch were a bit too fatty...and the pool area (they encourage you to swim afterward) could be better maintained (on our visit nobody got in). But even with those criticisms, it was excellent.OH, and they have several crazy cute/affectionate dogs roaming the premises...which for dog lovers such as myself is also a plus."

Tried is the operative word, but it was good fun. Unfortunately, some of the horses are not as cooperative and just loll about and it makes it harder to \"get in the game\". Staff are very friendly and professional. Not an inexpensive day, but worth it for us. We would remind those who attend to remember to provide a tip/propina to the staff. It is greatly appreciated, and unfortunately, we saw some groups did not drop anything into the tip jar. The staff on the ranch work hard to give you a nice day. We recommend this day trip.

So, to complete a family trip to Buenos Aires, this topped our bucket list. We were not disappointed.My teenaged daughters both have riding experience, while my wife and I have done little more than trail rides in national parks in Western USA. The day was perfect for all of us. We were picked up at the flat we were renting and taken by bus about an hour north of the city to a private polo club. There, members pay for the ability to compete, in much the same way as folks in the USA might belong to a golf club. Once there, Pablo, our leader explained the game to us and why it is so expensive. For actual polo matches, the number of horses required is enormous. Each 4 person team has a fresh horse for every one of the 7 minute \"chukkas (like innings in baseball).\" There are 4 chukkas in a demonstration game with most regulation matches having 6 chukkas. That's 6 chukkas times 8 horses (4 for each team) for a total of 48 horses!We were greeted with delicious empanadas and wine. We then were provided a history of polo and the basics of the game. Then we all had a chance to watch a demonstration match. Between the 4 chukkas, when they were changing horses, we had a chance to practice hitting the ball with mallets. There was plenty of equipment, so we all had time to get the hang of it. After the match, we all sat down to an amazing barbeque lunch, with as much excellent Argentinian Cabernet as we wished to consume.After lunch we were assigned horses and equipment. The staff helped instruct us further as we began using the mallets to hit balls from horseback. After about 20 minutes of practice, we had an impromptu match. It was well orchestrated with the instructors prodding us along. We all had great fun (although I'm still sore a week afterwards!). The well trained horses did most of the work taking us along for the ride.When our match was over, there was more wine, swimming and an air conditioned bus back to BA. I wouldn't change a thing. The team has been doing this for a while and really know how to make their guests comfortable. They also did a great job keeping us all safe. I'd recommend this experience to anyone. At $175 per person, I feel it was an outstanding value."

Very well organized and well run--with enthusiastic instructors and lots of great people to help our group learn the sport and play in a match. This is a small club of 12 members with a wonderful facility only about 45 minutes drive from Buenos Aires--and they pick you up! In fact, my driver was a member of the club and a great instructor himself. They believe polo is for everyone and they prove it. Oh, and the lunch was fantastic--traditional grilled meats and vegetables--and of course, lots of red wine. Yes, you can drink wine and play polo at the same time. Don't miss Argentina Polo Day."

You then get to witness a full game of Polo played by professional riders and in between each quarter enjoy some fun games/interaction. The sport is absolutely impressive to me so was very enjoyable to learn about the game & actually know how intense,hard & physical it is for both the riders and the horses! We then ate a beautiful BBQ lunch with homemade lemonade, more wine & fresh fruit! Vegetarian option is also delicious! After lunch we each got on our own horse all geared up for a practice & then our very own match! The horses are so well trained & although i found it quite difficult to coordinate everything it was the best fun! After the game we enjoyed some sangria and a swim in the pool with time to relax & chat!  This day was so well organised & the staff were exceptional! I can highly recommend this day out for anyone of all ages! I not only learnt a lot, I met some great people & thoroughly enjoyed some time outdoors and would do it all over again! It was certainly a nice change to the city & one of my favourite day tours so far in my travels!"

Easy day out of the city.There was only a small group of 5 of us for the whole day, and we were very well looked after. 30 - 45 minute drive out of city, gorgeous ranch. Greeted with delicious Argentinian wine and food all day (yes, drinking before riding!). Provided with education about the game, had fun learning skills, watching a match, and then playing. Horses were lovey, however I prefer to look at them rather then ride them, however they were pretty slow and safe and I really have an appreciation of the skill and effort of both horse and rider.The hosts took some photographs of the day, unfortunately it appears a majority of them did not make it to the facebook site or email to us like they said they would. Perhaps they can provide everyone with a USB of the photos at the end of the day (cheap costs which goes a long way).Would definitely recommend this day tour to anyone interested in having a true Argentinian BBQ and learning about the game of Polo.Good value for money and smiles all day!"

Personal pick up from our hotel right on time. 45 minute drive to a world away from downtown Buenos Aires.. It was amazing how quickly we could be in the countryside. We started with a glass of wine and an empanadas. Ten of us watched an exhibition game of four \" quarters\" which is half the length of a championship game. In between quarters (checkers) we learned about the mallet,practiced striking the ball and aiming at a target, and practice passing. All on firm ground. The people in the full day program actually rode horses later. We learned a lot and will definitely do the full day if we return to Buenos Aires."

Watched some polo with plenty of wine and water. Amazing Argentinian BBQ. Then they let us get on the horses to try to play polo. Could have been fun but it was 80-90 degrees so we were just dripping with sweat. Then relaxed with more wine and the pool and were home by 7pm. Plusses: great service, good food, plenty of wine. Downsides: weather dependent, I think they day is worth closer to $125 than $175."

Celia sent sincere apology emails to all customers, and asked if any customers took photos and would like to share with us.

However, with a half hour sleep on the bus ride, the sun shining and Pablo pouring us amazing malbec red wine, I was in for a great day. Empanadas and wine while we were coached on polo 101. Wine while watching a few chukkas (polo periods) between Chilean families and teachers. Wine with an amazing lunch (I think I fell in love with malbec!). And finally, getting to ride the horses and having a huge game of polo between everyone! Now I've only briefly rode horses twice before this. I've got to say, these horses appeared happy and proud, were well groomed and super responsive to ride! I haven't ridden a supercar before but it felt like I was in a Ferrari. It was great talking to the horse, thanking him for letting me ride him (I'm ~90kg) and working as a team to get to that little ball and getting some good hits in!All up, it was a great day learning a lot about polo, and Pablo had a great sense of humour and was an excellent host. It was a group of about 14 of us and we were all very well looked after! Thank you Argentine Polo Day :)"

The polo experience is right at the limit for being \"worth it for the money\" but, given that I'm a poor student and hate paying $6 for a beer, that's a pretty solid compliment. It's definitely a unique event that is worth being the big splurge of your Buenos Aires trip and the staff doing a fantastic job of teaching and supporting you. The unlimited red wine was a little unnecessary in the heat of the sun (cold lemonade or mango juice would have been more appreciated) but it was so cool to see experts play the game and then get your own shot. They do a great job of progressively bringing you up from hitting the ball to touching a horse to hitting the ball on an ambling horse to the real high-paced game. And the grilled meat and relaxing in the pool afterwards is soooo nice!"

Even without any experience riding a horse, Argentine Polo Day will teach you to play polo.I had an awesome experience with Argentina Polo Day from beginning to end. Beginning months in advance, I contacted Celia from Argentina Polo Day, who was very friendly and helpful with making my reservation. Even though I was traveling by myself, Celia was able to accommodate me. Even when heavy rain washed out the polo grounds, Celia was quick to contact me about rescheduling. And even though I had to fly out of Argentina the same day, Celia made arrangements to have me taken directly to the airport.The Polo Day itself was a ton of fun. It was a beautiful day out in the countryside. The rules and terminology of polo were explained to me as I drank wine. I got to watch a live polo match, while sitting in the shade. Then we were treated to a delicious asado.Finally, once our bellies were full, we put on our gear, mounted our horses, and really did play polo. Of course, our game didn't look exactly the same as the one played by the professionals. Our game looked like it was played in slow-mo. LOL. But it was still a lot of fun.Pablo was a great host. He was very enthusiastic, encouraging, and gracious. And his english was excellent.I highly recommend Argentina Polo Day."

The instruction on the horses was really great, and they take excellent care of the polo ponies. I was worried about that because it was very hot and I grew up riding horses and know how dangerous that can be, but the grooms made sure to cool the horses off, get them water but not too much or too soon, etc. All the horses we rode (different horses, and at much lower speeds of course than those we saw the polo club play on) were fantastically well-trained and sweet. We played a game and each team had two ringers (polo club members) on our teams that couldn't score but helped move the game forward, making it a lot more fun than if it were just us newbies. Perfect for couples, a group of friends, or even a family with older children. Overall I couldn't be happier with my experience! Next time I'm in Buenos Aires, I'll be going back!"

See a Polo game and practice yourself in between the checkers. After the barbecue you ride and play a polo game yourself. Big fun! Then swim in the pool to cool down before you are brought back to your hotel."

If you can afford the reasonable fee, then go; it's polo after all! Most of us will never have a chance to actually play, so this is a worthwhile excursion.There were only 2 bad things:1. The van was late by 45 minutes or so. They did extend our day, however, and we definitely got our moneys worth. It was just annoying. I believe they said they were using a new driver, and would likely not use him again. They also apologized for our delay, which was nice.2. They took photos of us with their company camera, so we refrained from taking a bunch of phoos on our own phones/cameras. However, there was a problem and most of our photos were not published on their FaceBook page. It was quite disappointing. I really wish I had a photo of myself on the horse with my gear on. Part of the fun of playing polo is, of course, showing your friends your kick @ss pictures!! I suggest taking your own photos as back up, especially a photo with yourself on the horse. This was an unintentional mishap, but still disappointing :(** TIP: Bring US Dollars, or pay in US Dollars through pay pal. It is cheaper than converting to Argentine pesos and paying in the local currency!Cheers, Nick"

After being picked up at our AirBnB in Buenos Aires, we were driven to a beautiful ranch outside of the city. We were immediately offered incredible empanadas (make sure to try the corn one) and all the wine we wanted. After settling in, we spent about two hours watching an exhibition polo match, learning the rules of the game, and practicing our skills (on the ground). Next was lunch--a feast of steak, ribs, grilled vegetables, and a fruit dessert that left everyone thoroughly happy. After lunch we were outfitted in our polo gear and spent the next two hours or so learning how to ride the horses and trotting around the polo field. Amazing. To conclude the day, we all took a dip in the pool (and were offered pizza and more drinks).Not only was the setting truly incredible, but the service was fantastic. Throughout the entire day, the staff took extra care to make sure that everyone had enough to eat and drink. It was also really interesting learning about polo and the horses. I'd recommend this to anyone visiting BA...you won't regret it."

Hotel pick up was on time but unfortunately, there was a demonstration that had traffic snarled for about an hour so we spent a long time getting to the club. But once we were there, what a wonder day we had! Some wine and empanadas greeted us, along with our hosts. We mingled for a while and then were treated to a \"lesson\" on the rules of polo and the equipment, along with a Q&A of anything we wanted to know about the game. Then off to the polo field to watch a four chukker game, played my members of the club. This was followed by an asado and then we received our equipment for our turn on the ponies! We attempted to play a game but mostly just had fun! All the activities on our program were conducted in English (as we all had that language in common). After a full day, we were returned to our hotels. It was a beautiful, interesting, relaxing, and fun day. If you have the time (I spent a full week in Buenos Aires) I say don't miss this one!"

Once you arrive there are delicious empenadas and a glass of wine waiting for you. So amazing. Then you get a little background on the sport of Polo and then you head over to the other side of the beautiful estate to watch some Polo. After you watch the game, you head back and enjoy a really good, traditional Argentine lunch. Frankly, I could have just eaten more of the empenadas instead. After lunch you head back over and learn how to play polo. It is so much fun. I had a bad experience with a horse early in my life - but these were all amazingly well trained and really know how to play polo, so you don't have to do much. Definitely the most fun I had while I was staying in Argentina!"

It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip and a \"can't miss\" experience. I really wanted to give it five stars -- the experience was amazing. I had to move down to four because although it was a truly fantastic experience, the ride there and back to the city were really uncomfortable. It is more like 1.5 hours (not 45 min) from Buenos Aires, which is fine, except there were four of us crammed in the small south american cars. I was literally unable to sit back in my seat because of the space issue in the back seat. The entire rest of the experience was a luxury, delicious empanadas and wine, an incredible lesson on a horse, and great BBQ -- but being so uncomfortable at the end of such an awesome day made me take it down to four stars. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone visiting Buenos Aires!"

It was nice to get out into the country and every aspect of the day was above expectations. The staff are wonderfully hospitable. They make you feel like they are welcoming you into their home, not a \"tour\". Their passion and enthusiasm for one of Argentina's favorite sports is genuine and infectious. The day starts with welcome wine and introductions, and a tour of the house. It is followed by an overview of the game of polo, the rules, riders and horses. We were then taken to the polo field to watch a live match. Amazing! Fast paced, exhilarating and exciting to watch, it was a great display of the power and skill of the horses and riders alike. In between chukkas, we were taught and practiced on foot the basic skills required to use the mallets and hit balls around the field. Lessons and the match were followed by a fantastic Argentinian barbecue. Great wine and so much great food! Again, this felt like lunch with friends rather than part of a day trip. After lunch, we were introduced to the grooms and taught how to ride a polo pony. Most of our group did not know how to ride but that was no obstacle. The staff's instructions were so simple and easy to apply that within minutes everyone was riding their horse around the field, chasing and hitting the ball. A few more minutes later and the competitive spirit began to show through and a 'real' (albeit slow-motion!) match was in progress. Booking this day was easy and efficient. Cecilia was very responsive and helpful. We arranged to be picked up from the hotel and the driver was courteous and on time. Throughout the day, the staff took photos so that we did not have to worry about multi-tasking photography with polo skills. The digital photos were shared with us at no extra cost. Note that there is a no-obligation request to leave a tip for the grooms, so bring some cash. They work hard to make the day successful so deserve it but we had not known this request would be made so we came unprepared. In summary, my husband does not ride and was not thrilled with the idea of a day with horses. He was reluctant to even join me and yet only a short while into the day, he was captivated, asking questions and enjoying himself. So much so, that he described this day as the best part of our trip to Buenos Aires. I couldn't agree with him more!"

I expected to learn about polo and maybe see some gameplay. The program is well run; there is introduction to the rules, then you head to the field to watch a match. Between sides, you get to visit with the horses and you spend some time playing training games to get a feel for the equipment. There was never a moment that felt awkward, unprepared, or unprofessional.3. The family also owns a winery in Mendoza. Part of your afternoon is spent drinking great wine while you watch. Sipping vino tinto in the sun and watching polo felt very posh.4. The food is amazing. When we got there, delicious empanadas were ready and waiting. The team cooked a traditional Argentine asado with entirely too much food, wine, and good conversation.We just finished a 2 week tour of Buenos Aires, Mendoza, and Santiago.

The team were friendly, enthusiastic and the day itself was both informative and great fun. Plenty of vino flowing and a yummy bbq lunch with a veggie option :). The polo lesson and match at the end of the day was awesome and allowed our competitive streaks to shine. This is a must do on one's visit to Buenos Aires!! Thanks Celia, Pablo, Ruben & team!!!"

At first I was a little hesitant due to the cost, but I can assure everyone that this experience is worth every cent! Luscious green grounds stretched the property, and the accommodating and friendly hosts set up quaint drink stations we could help ourselves to. Huan and Paulo were so friendly and always made sure we were okay and were enjoying ourselves.We watched a polo match played by professionals then were taught how to play the game and ride the beautiful horses. The food was amazing too - empanadas, succulent meats and vegetarian options...I could go on. It was so delicious I couldn't stop eating!I can't stress on how amazing this experience was. We all enjoyed it. A must do in Buenos Aires!!"

It was such a fun day that was made unforgettable by feeling part of the family and polo club. Pablo was entertaining in his explanation of the sport and he made it easy for us to give things a go. There was never a dull moment all day and we were completely taken care of from the start with flowing food and drinks and photographs being taken for us so we could just enjoy the moment, which I feel everyone in our group did thoroughly. I wish to return again one day, and I sincerely hope anyone else visiting Argentina makes this day trip while you are in the country and have the chance."

Arriving at the polo villa, you are welcomed with a smiling Ruben, who was there all day to talk to the guests. You receive empanadas- freshly baked and wine upon arrival. Learn a bit about polo and the horses, before learning to play with the mallet, and watching a polo match. Beware it is it sunny and hot out, there is little shade while watching the match. It can get very, very hot. Water is provided though. Pablo ensured all were involved in the activities, rolling the ball for the match, feeding the horses, ringing the bell at the end of the chukker etc. Lunch is served at a large piicnic table under trees, the table was beautifully set, and the food just kept arriving, grilled meat, salads, vegetables, rice and dessert. Of course wine, beer, juice and water also provided. After a late lunch, you get your equipment on and go out to the field to get on a horse and play a game. We have never been on horses before, it was a little frightening at first, but the groomers helped us out a lot throughout. What an experience! It gives a whole new appreciation for the horses and the game and skill required. After the match, back to the villa for cold drinks, and photos.The whole day was very well organized, and there was a nice balance of activities. Amazing experience!! Where else can you play a game of polo while learning and embracing the beautiful countryside and the hospitality of everyone at the polo villa!"

We felt like coming into a loving family, spoiled with beautiful surroundings, fantastic food and a casual atmosphere. We left with the proud feeling of actually having played a round of Polo, and a day to remember with joy in our hearts.This should serve not only as the highest recommendation...but a MUST DO !!! when visiting BAGracias, Pablo and all who helped make this day so extraordinaryCarola and Toby"

I can't add much to what has already been said - this is an excellent experience which we will not soon forget.The one thing that was different about our visit was that we went with a small baby - 7 months old. We were a bit wary of doing the trip and were afraid we would not be able to participate fully. All the staff were incredibly reassuring and made us and our little guy comfortable. They made him a little crib with couches and made sure he was always well-protected from the sun and the flying polo balls. They watched/held him for us so we could enjoy the excellent asado. When it was time for us to go play, they looked after him and kept him happy and safe for the whole game! I think we must have been out there on the field for at least an hour (probably more though) and our baby was happy the whole time.Obviously this trip is fantastic for solo travelers or groups, but I would add that it definitely can be done with kids or babies. It is an amazing experience and should not be missed!I will add my voice to the chorus saying that the host Pablo is top-notch - truly a world-class guy working for a world-class organization."

It was a long drive due to traffic, but the car was comfortable and it gave the guests a good opportunity to get to know one another. We arrived at the comfortably furnished estancia and immediately were served orange juice and an empanada that was really good. We then learned about polo as we were offered more wine and snacks. The grounds were a nice change from the city. Wide open spaces, farm animals, trees and fresh air. Then we went to the polo concha to watch some of the clubs members play a match. I've never played polo nor watched it so I didn't know anything. They explained the rules and some of the finer points as we watched, which helped me understand the game. Then we went back to the estancia and had some really good barbecue. We ate with the members who had been playing, and they were eating the same food. It was good food. By far the best part was after lunch, when we mounted up on horses and got to actually play polo. What fun. And really surprising given that I had no prior experience. Where else am I going to play polo? For me it's not an easy thing to do. But I had so much fun whacking the ball around on the horse that now I might go to great lengths to find another opportunity. Tons of fun. Do it!"

It all starts off on the ground learning the ropes, and towards the end of the day, you jump on a friendly horse and head for the field, culminating in a friendly game amongst the guests.

Argentina Polo Day provides a total immersion experience into this incredible sport and cultural mainstay.From the moment Pablo picks you up at your hotel or apartment, you just know that you are going to have a day to remember for a long long time. All of the reviews you read are not lying, this will be one of, if not the highlight of your time in Buenos Aires.The day consists of to-die-for empanadas, informative instruction on the rules of Polo, up close and personal observation of a Polo match, a delicious lunch, and yes, your very own match...played by you and your group! I know! Are you saying to yourself 'but I have never ridden a horse, how can I even begin to play Polo?'. No joke, put your trust in Pablo, you will ride that horse, and you will hit that ball from that horse!

Pablo was a fantastic host and made us all feel very welcome and comfortable. The food was excellent - a barbecue lunch was served (plus their empanadas were amazing!) along with fresh juice and wine. Also included are transport to/from the hotel/hostel, horse riding lessons and you finish the day taking part in your very own polo match."

Spent an amazing sunny day at La Carona and it was one of the best experiences of my adventures. We were greeted with so much warmth and wine from our local guide Pablo The morning started with a glass of red wine and fresh empanadas from the outdoor oven. I am a bug foodie so I was excited to see all the BBQ and wood fire oven starting up. We were given a small intro about Argentinian Polo, had a tour of the horses and players before going to sit down in the amazing sun drinking our wine and learning the basics of a polo match. After watching the pros on the field we got back for lunch which was situated outside in the open air. It was amazing and I had wished that one day I would be able to have this style of lunch, outside in the fields with amazing food. Ok I think I've written enough. A must when you come to Argentina."

While we were watching the pros play it rained but they kept playing! We stood under large pine trees and did not get wet (they are HUGE). I asked why they didn't stop and the reply was \"It is our passion\". The rain eventually stopped, the pros changed and we had an amazing lunch with them. THEN it was our turn. After the lesson, we got on the horse and when we got on the field it began to rain....AND I didn't even notice! The exhilaration of hitting the ball and being on the horse made me forget the rain. It was only then that I understood why the Pros never stopped. The horses are geniuses! Do not underestimate them. If you have never ridden (or are have little or NO experience) you will be paired with a horse to suite your needs. Our instructor was excellent, the horses superb and our experience one of a kind; it was worth every penny! Overall a beautiful day in the countryside of Argentina, learning from amazing animals with an excellent staff. Cannot wait to book a longer clinic; I think my husband is hooked!"

The food was absolutely to die for. ( a testament to Ruben and Celine as I believe they previously ran restaurants which is why they are so good at this)The place is very beautiful, set in a great part of Argentina. I have riden a bit but the two other guests had never been on a horse and by the end of the day we all could play polo. It is certainly not cheap but polo never is and this was a great experience and one which I hope to repeat again with Celine, Ruben and their team. Great family vibe, genuinely fantastic family and staff, who take care of your every need. You wont be disappointed, we are all hooked on polo, with the 2 beginners planning toreturn for a weeks polo course! thanks to everyone at Argentina Polo Day! definitely a highlight of my 3 month trip across South America!"

The entire staff was great and knowledgable. The meal is amazing and they are never shy to refill your glass of wine. Jumping on a horse after nearly 15 years of not being on one is a little intimidating however after a few minutes you realize the horses are so well trained there is nothing to really fear. The next day my friend and I wanted to go again and if I go back to Buenos Aires, I will definitely go back for another Polo Day. This is a must do if you are in Buenos Aires."

This was largely down to the atmosphere created by the hosts - you are made to feel so welcome and relaxed. The day starts with an explanation of the rules of polo, then an exhibition match. After that a beautifully executed Asado, with plenty of red wine for those who like a glass (or two). Then came our turn to ride. We got a full 1 hour 45 mins of riding - first practising stick and ball, then played our own match. I do ride at home normally, but there were plenty of others there who had not ridden before or not ridden for a long time and they were able to experience the benefit of the whole day too.At the end of the day, all of the participants agreed we should go out for dinner in Buenos Aires and Celia even organised this for us.

You even get to play a polo game with some (semi) professional polo players and you will be served wine and delicious football day long.

Watching the polo game was fascinating and trying to play myself was also fun, Even though i am still convinced I'm the worlds worst polo player. As almost everything else in argentina, you will pay less if you have dollars. At least at the current rate.

We hadn't ridden horses since summer camp when we were little, so I was prepared for a ridiculous (albeit hilarious) experience, watching my brothers try to play a sport we knew nothing about - while riding a horse! What I didn't realize is that we would have an INCREDIBLE guide to lead us through the day, teach us about the sport, show us how the pros play, and then several of the Polo Day staff members would give us one-on-one training - and then we would all get to play together! Oh, and all while sipping on wine and munching on the best empanadas I've ever had. It was amazing. Pablo greeted us at our hotel, and was an incredible guide from that moment through the end of the afternoon. Knowledgeable, funny, enthusiastic, and understanding, Pablo truly made this a wonderful memory we won't soon forget. I can't say enough about this sport, the wonderful club members we ate lunch with, the delicious empanadas, the relaxing atmosphere, and of course - our amazing guide! My brothers were beyond happy with the experience, and we all left smiling from ear to ear. My only regret? Not stretching before! Seriously, riding horses is tough! But it was well worth the pain, and I would go out of my way to recommend this to anyone planning a trip to Buenos Aires. If there's one thing you do while you're in Buenos Aires, make it playing polo with Pablo at Argentina Polo Day. In a word, it was perfect! If nothing else, you'll eat the best empanadas of your life - which is why we're all going to Argentina in the first place, right? :) 5 stars! Thank you Argentina Polo Day for the experience of a lifetime!"

It started out with us being picked up at our hotel, then we were driven about 30 minutes or so out side of the city where we came upon the ranch. I personally had never ridden a horse before but wasn't too nervous to being with. Also the delicious never ending wine helped me to get on the horse. I will say that I spent an entire month in Argentina trying to find the best empanadas and these were it. First we learned a little bit about how the sport is played, then we watched a polo match of 4 v 4. They let us throw the ball into play and ring the bell to signify the end of each round. After we watched the polo game we had the most delicious lunch,Salad, asado, grilled vegetables, chorizo, and all the trimmings. By the end of lunch I wasn't sure how I would be able to ride the horse because I was so full, but I did anyway and it was a great time. I wasn't very good at making contact with the ball but I still managed to score a goal somehow. After the game we drank more wine while we relaxed and talked about our day. Overall my experience was top notch. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."

Wow what a fabulous trip to the Argentina polo day I was so glad I did this as I was a little nervous before hand going on my own but no need to be single travellers as Pablo and the team made me feel so welcome set in a beautiful location about an hour from BA I cannot recommend this day highly enough ..on arrival at the ranch the glass of Malbec was very welcome ..and then well it was just such an interesting day learning about the tack rules history and ponies of polo ..throughout the day you just feel so involved ..off to the field to watch a few chukka and some photos with the players then it's lunch everyone sits down together for lunch and it was delicious lovely fresh plenty to eat and more of that lovely Malbec! Next up best bit of the day playing polo it was a blast! I loved it the horses are so well schooled it feels very safe and there is lots of professional help! but when it was match time couldn't help but get competitive! There is such a genuine welcome and enthusiasm from ruben Pablo and celia and all the team that you can't fail to have a great day ..I'm now back in Scotland with my polo mallet dulce de leche and great memories ..I've been travelling all over the world for 18 years and this is by far one of the best things I've done can't wait to go back ..go go go you won't regret it! Thanks Pablo ruben and celia !"

Don't believe the hype, you may feel happy with the experience after copious amounts of wine however I do not drink so can give a rather sober review. The food was not of the quality I had expected, if I had know the quality food/drink I would have eaten before or brought my own. Provided with Concentrated orange/lemon juice when I had requested and been assured by Celia via numerous emails I would have fresh fruit juices as I do not drink wine and not a fan of gaseous drinks.Would definitely recommend the Horse riding experience that Miriam and Adrian offer and which rightfully claims the No1 spot at this point, as there passion for horses resonates through the trip, whereas this is trip is more of a money making trip In my personal experience. Would have been safer to have wine offered after the polo game, sooner or later some one will get hurt, as some people had drunk 1 to 1 and a half bottles of wine before getting on a horse. We saw a game before and witnessed an expert take a rather nasty fall, so the obvious risks are there.If I had known what the experience would have been like I would have saved my money and done some more horse riding lessons instead.Over priced for what was offered IMHO."

Pablo, our charismatic host, made sure our cups were always full and we had everything we needed all day. After an explanation of the rules, we watched a pro game and drank a few more bottles of wine. Then we had what I can only describe as a \"meat feast\". Every cut of cow and pig you can think of. And more Malbec. Then it was time to play. For real. While most of us just tried to stay on our horses, we were able to play a proper game with the pros assisting. A few people even scored goals. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard (from drunken terror). Good times.We did a lot of fun activities throughout our 2 week stay in Argentina. This was by far our favorite day. Thanks Pablo!"

I booked very last minute, and off the bat, was impressed by how warm and professional Celia was - extremely prompt and helpful without being pushy in the slightest. Sent an email at midnight, and she came back less than an hour later. What makes APD stand out is that you're made to feel like family as soon as you arrive on the ranch. Despite having zero experience with horses or polo, I felt safe and looked after the whole day - nothing but sincere hospitality, amazing food, a lot of laughs, and an unexpectedly gratifying amount of riding and playing time. Poly is hilarious and somehow manages to teach you all the rules and technique of the game while keeping you entertained, well fed, and your wine glasses topped - an impressive combination of host, instructor, personal cheerleader, and all-around fun guy. The team's attention to detail and thoughtfulness is evident in everything from the overall layout of the day to the small touches like having bug spray prepared and mate to pass around after the ride. There's a genuine passion for polo that is infectious, and after a day with them, I came away with a real interest to play more.A special mention to the genius behind the empanadas since I had to physically restrain myself from grabbing a third.. or was it a fourth? :) Can't recommend highly enough.

The team at Argentina Polo Day couldn't have been more well-organized, professional, friendly or informative if they tried. We were picked up by Paolo in BA in the morning and watched an instructional/informative video about polo, its history and its rules along the way out to the polo field. Once at the polo field Paolo talked to us a bit further about the rules and equipment, poured us a glass of wine, served us an amazing empanada and then we headed across the field to watch the pros play. We were involved in the game by ringing the bell and throwing the ball into the field for the players all the while Paolo was teaching us further about the game (which was very high speed and excellent). After the game we enjoyed an asado lunch with the players which was delicious and relaxing. Then we put on our gear and headed out into the field to try our hand at the game. The horses were very well behaved and there was one pro to help each amateur. They really went out of their way to make sure that we were getting how to hold the polo mallet and to hit the ball (all the while somehow staying on the horse!). When we were comfortable we 'played' a match with a couple of the pros in the game as well. When they dropped us off in BA at around 7pm that night we were thoroughly exhausted and very happy with our day. Thank you sooooooooo much for such an amazing day! When we return to BA we will certainly be back!"

After the bbq we all put on polo gear and played an hour long polo match. It was the first time riding a horse for many in our group, but the horses were well trained, so few had any trouble at all.

On arrival at the Polo club we were greeted by a handful of very friendly and welcoming staff members, offering delicious empanandas, wine and drinks as we took in the beautiful surroundings. Pablo then gave us a full and very entertaining explanation about the game of Polo, the rules, the care of the horses, the uniforms, the history, and the etiquette of the game. Then we had the opportunity to watch a real Polo match and even see the change over of horses between chukkers. We then enjoyed a delicious Argentine barbeque together with some of the players and staff, including one of the owners. After this wonderful lunch we were then given our Polo uniforms and saddled up on well trained horses to play our Polo match. We had so much fun and have gained a new understanding and admiration of the game of Polo. Thanks to Pablo, Ruben and everyone there that made this day unique, remarkable, and so much fun.

I was amazed that people who had never ever been on a horse before were able to ride, play Polo have fun and look the part. As I said the horses are very well trained and gentle. Lots of fun.

It was quite difficult (and here is the only small negative thing of the day: we all thought it might have been more fun if we just got to play on our own instead of some of the locals - being much better than us - always stealing the ball just when we were close to scoring) but still a great lot of fun, and probably the coolest experience of our Argentina-trip!

Having always wanted to try playing polo, Argentina Polo Day seemed like a great option based on the reviews online. Suffice to say, they did not disappoint!I was driven to and from my hotel in BA by their friendly staff, and was able to join another group, as I was an individual. The staff was incredibly friends with a great sense of humor, and really took the time to ensure each person in the group had a great experience and learned a lot about the sport. The wine and food were also fantastic!I highly recommend this to anyone seeking to do something outside the box while in Argentina!"

The people were so accommodating and the man who was in charge had excellent English. We sat down with him and got to enjoy some of the best food, while he explained in detail the rules of polo. We were served red wine, and empanadas, no questions were too hard for the instructor. He looked after all of us so well and even though I was a little scared at the beginning to ride the horse, he encouraged us and made sure we were very comfortable. Polo was so much fun, especially after a few red wines. We all agreed that this was our most favourite day yet. I'm so glad I got to be apart of a very different and exciting activity. The horses were looked after well and they seemed to also love playing polo. Wish I could take part again."

Great service - The rain last night made the ground very wet and muddy to play but the polo team was still able to have a wonderful real game for us to watch aside. Amazing food - empanadas, wine and BBQ were all delicious and unlimited. Nice instructor - dedicated and caring. It was much easier to watch than to play, and finally I was glad to hit the ball and practice in a game. Plan ahead to save one day. I had to go to airport directly after the polo day and paid extra for a private car to drop me off to the airport. A final note to finish, it's totally fine to go there alone and enjoy the game with your new friends in the team. Tons of fun."

Out of a two and a half week holiday in Brazil and Argentina, this was definitely the best activity - my friend and I had an amazing day! Pablo and Stephane were brilliant and the horses amazing. Watching a polo match is a thrilling experience - the speed and grace of the horses and the skill of the men is outstanding. You realise how skilled they are when you try it for yourself! You get a good amount of time on the horses and depending on how experienced/confident you are the guys will either let you ride around the polo field a bit more freely or stay with you. One of my favourite parts of the day was visiting the lagoon after playing polo and cantering through it with Stephane. A day I will never forget!p.s. see Facebook for their photos!"

My Dad & I were met at our hotel lobby by a friendly and informative guide/polo professional who drove us to the ranch about an hour outside of Buenos Aires. In the car journey, we learned the basics of the game of polo, polo horses, etc, and then met the rest of the team. It had rained the day before, but the game carried on dispite the wet conditions. We enjoyed wine, empanadas and many laughs on the side line as we watched the polo match. We tried our hand hitting the ball with a polo mallet both on the ground and on horseback (those willing!!). It was a fabulous day, one I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about an amazingly competitive and graceful sport. On our way back into town, ee visited a property where guests can stay for several days/weeks to learn more about the sport and refine their game. That's next on my bucket list!!

When I came to Argentina, I was hoping for a possibility to see a match - it didn't even occur to me that it would be a possibility to actually play polo myself. This was actually my boyfriend's idea, whose riding experience is non-existent (okay, to be fair he has sat on a mule once...). We looked into several places but Argentina Polo Day made the best first impression. When we sent them an e-mail we immediately got a very enthusiastic mail back from Celia, and she also said that my boyfriend's lack of riding experience wouldn't be a problem (which was something I was quite worried about). Her response made us even more excited and sure that we were coming to the right place. We got picked up in the morning and on the way to the ranch we watched an instruction video. When we arrived we were greeted by the most playful and happy dogs I have ever met (I'm more of a cat person) and we were handed some drinks. After some more instruction, we got to watch a training game and instructor Poly immediately got us involved in it, a.o. practicing with the ball and stick during the breaks. After the match we had a lovely asado lunch in which some of the riders also joined.Then it was finally time to ride! We had some practice time for about 45 minutes to get used to the horses and to practice with the ball and stick. Of course to hit the ball from on top of the horse is not so easy but the horses were very good about it. After that we played a low-speed game and it was absolutely awesome. Everyone got totally into it and I felt the game was relatively fair in the sense that everybody got enough time with the ball (more or less). I even got to hit the ball from a slow canter a few times which I thought was very cool. After that we were exhausted, so we took a jump in the pool before going home.I would definitely recommend this trip. Your stay in Argentina is not complete without it!"

I would recommend to anyone to talk the time to spend with them.There are many positive things to say, you can read the other reviews to see what I mean, but there is one particular point I want to pass on. The people that run the ranch, our host for the day, and the members of the club who play polo- are all truly genuinely happy to have you there. I felt like part of the family for the day, not just a tourist.The food is amazing and the ranch beautiful, so even if you're not a horse person go there for the lunch and day outside the city.As another note, my husband and I are not easily fussed, like all food and are fairly athletic and we had a blast. However a few of the other people in our group had a range of dietary restrictions, were uneasy about playing the game and had particular scheduled to keep - they also had a blast. Everyone was catered to, and the hosts were very genuinely concerned that we had what we need, and we enjoying our day."

I wouldn't change either and if this day was only polo and empanadas then it would have been 5 stars. However, there were some awful elements.We were told it was 45 minutes from pickup to the ranch. It was 2 hours. Two hours!!!! We drove around BA picking up other people and 2 hours later we were there, dripping in sweat as we weren't allowed to open the windows in the car because of dust but the AC only worked for the two people in the front. On the car - THIS WAS REALLY DANGEROUS - we were picked up in a car that fit 6 people, with 6 seat belts. However, 7 people were put in. So one person had no seatbelt and there were three people jammed in a seat for 2 people\u2026 for 2 hours. Uncomfortable and unsafe. Continuing with the car - It shut off, completely, whilst we were driving - TWICE! Yeah! So not only did we not have seats or seat belts but we were in a car that stopped working whilst it was in use. Awesome.The wine was nice, but they ply you with wine before putting you on a horse. This is weird. And dangerous. A bit off.The lunch was disgusting. The \"steak\" was inedible. You couldn't cut it with a knife. They should've just served empanadas again. Every person was taking the meat and throwing it on the ground for the dogs. Inedible.Then there's the toilet. The toilet with no water. The one and only toilet that had poop in it that I had to go pee on top of. Twice. As did everyone else.Not sure if I'd do this again or recommend it. It had great parts but the safety issues paired with toilet issues was a bit too much. If I'm paying that much money I'd like to at least have safe transportation and a clean toilet. Oh - lastly - heading back was again 2 hours. We were told that we'd be back no later than 7pm. We were dropped off at 8:40 pm and missed our dinner reservations."

We were picked up by Poly at our hotel, driven to the club, and served wine and empanadas immediately (early and often!). We learned the rules of polo, watched a match, asked questions, drank a TON of wine, and then had a great Argentinian BBQ lunch. After lunch, it was time to gear up and mount up for some polo! We played for over 90 minutes, and although my horse was a pain in the rump, it was a great experience. It truly made you appreciate how talented the REAL players are. We took a dip in the pool and were driven back to our hotel. It was really a unique and unforgettable experience. DO IT!"

The day was perfect, we were very lucky in terms of weather; although it was warm and sunny there was a nice breeze which helps with this activity. Don\u2019t be put off this if you have never ridden before as there were many people in our group that had not and picked it up very quickly. The horses are great and are use to novice riders. When we arrived we were given wine and empanadas, which were lovely and you are supplied with wine the whole day which is brilliant. The lunch is also great and there was a great selection and plenty of food for our big group. The staff are amazing, so friendly and welcoming and go out their way to accommodate everyone\u2019s needs. The day is also informative as well as a lot of fun. My only regret is not doing the polo day at the beginning of our holiday so I could have done it again! I would recommend this to everyone, great day and brilliant value for money."

From private pick up, to yummy welcoming empanadas, to bottomless wine and beer, friendly staff, great guide, polo match and explanation, amazing BBQ and finally getting to play polo ourselves then chilling by the pool afterwards. Everything was perfect and so much fun, even if we did struggle to hit the ball.Don't hesitate, if you're in any way interested at all you'll love this. I love horses but my boyfriend has never ridden before and he enjoyed it more then I did!"

Luckily the rain cleared in time for our warmly greeted arrival and we were treated to the most amazing day! My highlight was Pablo our gorgeous guide who knew everything, answered every question and never let our wine glasses become empty (which is very difficult with 5 Australian girls!) The horses on the ranch were beautiful and friendly and they clearly enjoyed the game of polo. The match was very fun to watch and the games in between were great and hilarious with my now tipsy girlfriends. The food throughout the day was the best I had in Argentina. The empandas were the best I have ever had! Pablo can I please have the recipe!? The lunchtime BBQ was so good and more wine and great company made it even better. I loved getting on a horse and riding around trying to play polo. My horse was very smart - it would stop close to the ball to let me hit it! They know when the tourists are hiding them!After a fun game of polo we decided to cool off in the swimming pool with more wine and banter. It was truly one of the best activity days I've ever done during all of my travels and highly recommend it to everyone! Now when I go to the Polo in Australia I will actually know what I'm watching and how hard it is to play!"

The price in pesos is a bit stiff, but things with horses are always in pricey. If you have cash USD it is an excellent deal. Aside from learning a ton about the game from absolutely ground zero, our group of mixed experience was playing a full-on game by the afternoon. I loved that more experienced players joined us, to help pass to us when we were first starting, then to act as defense when we were playing, to show what kinds of things you have to watch out for in a real game. They were really good about making sure everyone was getting a chance to touch the ball or score."

My husband, 21 yr old son and I were only in Buenos Aires for 1 days (in port on a cruise) and we wanted to do something memorable so we contacted Argentina Polo Day. Stefan picked us up at a hotel not far from the port and drove us 45 minutes to the ranch. We were greeted warmly then joined another group who had come out to spend the day. We were given instructions on the rules of polo then took our seats next to the field to watch a match. We got to participate by throwing in the ball and ringing the bell between chuckers (periods). While the riders were switching horses (they do this every 7 or 8 minutes) we were given shorter mallets to practice hitting the ball. This was lots of fun. We also got to talk to the players and ask them questions about their horses. The match was very competitive and exciting. Afterwards, we walked over to a several long tables that were set with platters of food down the middle. We were treated to a royal Argentine BBQ with a large variety of meats and vegetables. Since we had to leave earlier than the rest of the party to get back to our ship, Stefan came and got us suited up in our polo gear so we could start riding. Each of us was given a mount suitable to our skill level and size. For those who had not ridden before they were given instructions and time to practice. If we had ridden, we were given a mallet and sent out on the field to practice hitting balls. I love riding horses and was surprised to find that hitting a ball made it even more fun. My son, who had never ridden, had no trouble maneuvering his horse to steal my balls. Before long we had divided into teams and were playing a match. We would all very sad when the time came for us to dismount and head back to the cruise ship.  Celia was wonderful to work with. Stefan let me ride one of his own polo ponies, La Colorada. He was a delightful instructor. Pablo our guide was charming and very informative. I highly recommend this adventure to anyone headed to the Buenos Aires area. You will not be disappointed!"

When I booked, I expected a relatively impersonal polo match, followed by a quick how-to for polo playing - was I ever wrong!! As soon as we arrived, we were greeted like friends, given a glass of wine and the best empanadas I've ever had. The atmosphere was warm and friendly, Celia and Pablo made us feel like family and introduced us to life in BA. After watching a fantastic polo match from the sidelines and meeting the polo players, we enjoyed a delicious BBQ with them and the staff, followed by an intro to polo playing. They gave us each a horse with a guide (if you needed one) and we spent about an hour riding around the luscious grounds getting comfortable with our horse and a mallet. Since there were only 4 'guests', they split us into 2 teams mixed in with polo players and guides and we played an actual polo match for close to an hour. I can't say enough about what a fantastic day this was...there is absolutely nothing I would change!! The food, the people, the guides, the polo playing...this will forever be one of the highlights of all my travels. If you like the outdoors, being active and seeing authentic polo playing, this is definitely a must-see and worth every penny!!Enjoy and say hi to Celia for me!Sonia Faucher (Canada)"

We were picked up at our hotel by a car and driver (at about 11 am). I had thought it would be a bus, but it was a private car! The drive was about 45 minutes outside of Buenos Aires, up the highway, down a road and then down a dirt road! Where were we headed? There was a house where we left our stuff and met the other participants. The day was run by the English speaking manager. First there was wine/Coke and homemade empanadas. They were delicious and plentiful. He gave us some basic tips about the game of polo. We walked out to the polo field where there were chairs set up for us to watch a game and see the horses. More empanadas, more drinks! Lunch was served back by the house. All grilled-- short ribs, onions, zucchini-- all delicious. After lunch was time for us to mount the horses and try our hand at a game of polo. Fun, fun, fun! It was a warm day back to the house and there was a swimming pool. Everyone had fun. Our driver picked us up and we returned to the city (at about 7pm).If you know some Spanish try talking to the owner, Ruben. He sat under an awning drinking a beer and watching what was going on. I had a nice conversation with him, he is delightful but does not speak English."

My 3 girlfriends and I booked this day trip with no expectations. 2 of them were a little skeptical of the program but once we reached the \"farm\", we had no doubts we were going to have a great time!Before I continue about the day itself, I should mention and recognize Cecila - my contact at Argentina Polo Day. I researched and started corresponding with her several weeks before the trip and she was always prompt, courteous and concise. Her follow up was pleasant and never pushy. . . The booking process was very smooth and they delivered on every promise - Very grateful for that since not every booking experience from afar is answered or efficient!About the day. . . they picked us up from our home at precisely the time they said they would. The ride out to La Carona was nice and the countryside was a nice departure from the hustle and bustle of BA. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the gorgeous Pablo and offered a glass of wine. We felt instantly relaxed, safe and at home!The colours and d\u00e9cor of the main house and surrounding farm was stunning. In the back of the house, there were tangerine trees brimming with fruit, a barbeque pit with colourful vegetables roasting and a nice long table set up for lunch. On the day we were there, there were 15 others from all over North America and it was great to meet fellow travellers!With a glass of wine in hand, we were seated and the origins and rules of Polo were explained. After this, we walked to the polo field and watched a very exciting polo match (while drinking even more wine!) Everyone really got into the game! Even though I didn't start the day as a fan of horse or polo, believe me when I say I have a huge amount of respect and love for both now!After a superb lunch of barbequed meats and vegetables and conversations with new friends, we actually got on the horses, worked on drills, and later had our own polo match (OK - so we THOUGHT we were having a match) Wow, what a work out but so much FUN! Most of us had not been on horses in decades but yet, we managed to hit the balls with our mallets and stay on the beautiful beasts! It was sad when our day ended. . . Many thanks to Pablo, a most handsome and charming facilitator! Thanks to everyone that took care of us - we know that there were many people in the background making sure every detail was perfect.If you are in BA, you must book Argentina Polo Day - You will have a great time! We are considering taking a trip back to Argentina so we can take a clinic there!"

I recently participated in an intensive eight day Polo Clinic at the La Carona Polo Club where daily guest participate in an extremely popular Polo Day event. Im an avid horseman and Endurance (long distance, multi-day) competitor residing in Washington State, USA. My long held desire was to travel to Argentina, the epicenter of world class Polo, and have my first experience in the sport be with the worlds best. A friend who attended Polo Day and subsequent clinics provided rave reviews and even insisted on attending with me. I can only say every expectation was exceeded! The accommodations were first class in the new club house, the food and wine were exquisite and ever so plentiful, the service superb and oh the Polo! I was assigned the head groom as my instructor and he was amazing. Manuel was patient as a saint with incredible horse and mallet skills. He paired me with the most sensational, well trained horses I have had the privilege to ride. My favorite, La Pintada, was a completely reliable, safe and beautiful painted Corollia with a silky smooth canter and gallop. She allowed me to ride at speed while concentrating on ball and mallet skills. All the horses were similarly well trained with lots of go. Every day included intense \"one on one\" training followed by interaction with the day guest in a fun, easy going match. They came from all over the world and most transformed from apprehensive doubters to enthusiastic participants as the day evolved. Everyone enjoyed themselves emensly. On the next to last day I noticed the owner, Ruben, observing me as I moved the ball up and down the field during my training session. To my never ending delight and consternation, he invited me to play in the club member match the following day. My stomach was churning as I worried about making a fool of myself or worse at speed with those quality players. Going for broke, I accepted and had one of the most marvelous experiences of my life. Although my ball handling skills were lacking, I was able to keep pace with the group an play some defense and even bump and grind as I went for the ball. ( I believe Polo is the only horse to horse contact sport). I could go on forever about this once in a lifetime experience. I'm sure I learned more in eight days than I would in a year of lessons back home. I plan to be back next year for a more advanced session and will practice, practice, practice in between!"

First you watch a game of Polo to understand the rules. They will gauge your experience on a horse (mine was almost none) and choose a horse accordingly. Once everyone is saddled up they teach you the basics of riding before you start practicing hitting the ball and playing at a walking or trotting pace. Very easy for everyone. For those with more experience who wanted to ride faster a group broke off and also had a great time battling it out. I'm actually quite sporty and had no problem hitting the ball and one of the workers traded his horse for mine and I was in full gallop before you knew it. It was truly one of the highlights of my trip and I'm seriously considering going back and spending a week there for their intensive session."

An afternoon of horse riding and polo lessons from the morning's players was a great introduction to the game and everyone in our group from us, in our late twenty's, to the seventy year old couple that earlier swore they would never get on a horse (they both ended up on horseback by the end of the day) had a blast. Thanks to all the staff who made it a day to remember!"

Our excellent host, Pablo picked us up, at our apt and just a 45 min drive to the pollo fields. We were greeted by a warm and friendly staff, and a glass of wine. While we sipped, Pablo explained the history of the sport in Argentina. Once the players were ready, we headed over to the field to watch the match. We participated in tossing the ball in and got to see all the pollo rules in action. After the match we were treated to an awesome Argentinian BBQ while enjoying great company and conversation. And then, yes, we mounted well trained ponies and got play pollo! Not too worry if you haven't been on a horse. The horses and staff are top shelf and will help you have a fun and safe experience. If you are looking for genuine Argentinian experience, this is it. The countryside is beautiful, and the people are amazing hosts who enjoy sharing their way of life with others.

Our guide, Pablo, arrived on time and was a fantastic source of humor and imformation the entire day. We were greated with fantastic empandadas once arriving to the fields with unlimited wine and beverages. We watched a polo match, learned about the sport and practiced. Lunch was an AMAZING parrilla which included several types of meat, salad, sides and again more wine. You will not be dissapointed with this lunch. Ever. Afterwards, we were able to pratice the sport with our own horses and teachers.This was our favorite part of the day. The staff could not have been more helpful or accomodating.Enough with this review...just take the tour and you will not regret it."

I just returned from an around the world trip and this was one of my favorite experiences on all five continents! It is a family owned facility, and they put their heart and soul into the business. I was picked up at the hotel on time and brought to the farm about 45 minutes outside of Buenos Aires. There was plenty of empanadas and wine when we arrived. I was paired with another couple and a woman from Australia who were a pure joy. We were explained the rules of the game and then were able to watch a polo match in the morning. The members playing were passionate, fun and enticing. There was a healthy competition to the game which made it exciting to watch and made me eager to learn. At lunch we were served an authentic BBQ with plenty of steak, vegetables, wine...and healthy conversation! In the afternoon we practice some strategies and were able to mount the horses. The horses are well cared for and groomed-true polo ponies with zest and vigor for the game. The staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and safe on and off the horses. They even lined me up for a goal or two! It was open of the most exhilarating experiences I have had in a long time. I could not stop smiling and laughing. It was pure joy! I would definitely recommend this experience to anyone interested in an amazing day. You do not need experience riding or with polo to enjoy yourself. Thank you again!!! This is not to be missed!!!!"

My coworker (Carol), mom and I all went to the Argentina Polo Day, with different expectations and desires for the day, but each of us left thinking that day was the very best of the trip. Carol, is allergic to horses, and even without being about to ride or touch the horses she said that the ability to watch and understand the game plus the gracious hosts made the day completely worth doing. Carol also loved sitting out of the city, getting some fresh air, while sipping on a delicious Malbec :). My mom, is afraid of horses, but she was able to go at a speed that made her comfortable and confident on the horse. They had a man walking directly with her the whole time she was on the horse, giving her tips and helping her feel safe. I love horses, but I'm not much of a rider. I wasn't afraid to try though, and the Polo day gave me a long private riding instruction. By the end of the day I was galloping and actually contributing to the game of Polo I was playing in. Seriously, the best day of my year!Yes the food is good/the wine is tasty, yes the scene is lovely, but more than any of that, the group of people at the field tailor the experience to you and make sure everyone leaves as happy as can be. How could you go wrong with an experience like that?! This is 100% a must do if visiting Buenos Aires!!"

There was a fire pit to keep us warm on the chilly winter day and the crew even provided us with jackets and blankets to watch the match. Each of us got a turn tossing the ball into play. The crew then directed us in playing warm up games on the field with the ball and mallet before we mounted the horses. Being a novice horseback rider the crew was so helpful in giving me explicit directions on how to 'drive'. I even managed to hit the ball a few times!!! We then went inside for an authentic Argentinian BBQ - and the food and wine flowed. Chorizo, steak, delish vegetables - I rolled out of there!!!

I am a 47 year old business man traveling thru Buenos Aires from Florida and decided to take a couple days of personal time to enjoy the world of Argentine Polo firsthand. I did my research and decided to book a 2 day Polo clinic this June at the El Camino Polo Club and Ranch in beautiful Pilar, Argentina just outside of Buenos Aires. Here, owner, polo player, coach, chef, and sommelier Ruben and his lovely wife Celia also operate their year-round \"Argentina Polo Day\" operations available to anyone living or visiting Buenos Aires. I really appreciate their love of polo and genuine interest to share this passion with those interested regardless of riding or playing experience. I haven't ridden in 4 years and after just a couple hours was feeling very confident and comfortable enough to accept the invitation to play 4 chukkas on my second day. Yes, Ruben threw me into the \"fire\" :-) and I loved it. I even made my first GOAL at that game and also found the other players to be very courteous and gracious to the \"new guy\". Ruben gives you lots of personal attention and he along with his instructors do a great job of helping develop riding and playing skills. You basically ride as much as you can handle or desire while there is daylight. Totally awesome ! Ruben has 3 polo fields with 2 more in a few weeks, over 60 horses and those I road were wonderful. Accommodations are available right inside the ranch or Celia can arrange for very luxurious accommodations nearby. I slept at the guest house at the ranch just steps from the polo field. The food is Fabulous!! and \"Don David winemaker\" is one of El Camino's sponsors, so his delicious wines are available at every meal. Ruben, Celia, the club members, and staff will make you feel like part of the family and I can honestly say my experience exceeded my expectations in all areas. It is a sincere pleasure to write this review and I look forward to my next visit."

Even if you are here for a quick trip regardless of time of year - do not miss out on Polo Day Argentina because they are open year-round! You will not regret it. It was my first time in BA and after emailing back and forth with Celia, who was FANTASTIC, responsive, patient and provided great information and details, we booked this activity for two people. I recommend for ALL travelers, frequent or first timers. The ranch is beautiful, Ruben and his staff are so wonderful and make you feel so comfortable, they explain the game very well, you get to watch an awesome game of polo, delicious asado and we got to experience horse-riding and some polo - for all level of experience. Don't be intimidated if you've never heard of polo, or if you are a pro - this is for you too! There is definitely a family feel to it and did not feel touristy. Such a great experience, and we loved it!"

From the first minute I felt at home and well looked after. A great mix between learning and playing polo, having a good time with friends and enjoying the countryside. If you already know how to ride and like fast sports you will return with a huge smile on your face that lasts for days (ok, and a sore wrist too ;-)). But knowing how to ride is not necessary. You'll love it!"

This time I brought my husband and we stayes overnight. It was fantastic: we started with a welcome drink over a romantic blazing fire, then slept in the most comfortable accommodation right there in the Club House. The next morning Ruben gave us a copious breakfast, after which we had a wonderful ride out along the estancia's grounds and beyond. Lunch was a fantastic as I remembered it and then it was time for the polo match. We brought our own Finca los Tigres Polo Team shirts with us and Ruben kitted out half of his men in our colours! Imagine our delight when \"we\"won!! After this uplifting experience my husband and I mounted our polo ponies and had a good time playing stick and ball, with exeprienced instructors who enjoyed teaching us yet that bit more! Sadly, we only had that day and left with many polo plans for the future. ArgentinaPoloDay is a superb way of getting to know polo and we thoroughly advise it!"

There were 12 of us plus another few couples and I cannot tell you how much we loved it! The booking process was super easy; they picked us up and dropped us back at the hotel - Celia is incredibly well organised - and more importantly, the experience is one I will never ever forget. The day stated off with the most delish empanadas we had anywhere on South America, wines and a quick explanation of the rules, Steph, Alex and Alex were such a joy. And the slight language barrier between us and Ruben did not curb his enthusiasm in demonstrating a range of essential skills. Brilliant! Following this, more wine while watching a professional polo match right there on the ranch. The game was fast and furious and of a very high standard, the young kid absolutely killed it! It was truly brilliant. Our lunch cooked on site all in their parrilla was absolutely delish. And as much as you could eat... Brontosaurus ribs we were calling them! And then...it was our turn, to mount the professionally trained polo ponies for some practice followed by a game against each other. Hilarious yto play, i cannot even begin to imagine how funny we were to watch. Luckily the horses knew what they were doing, such amazing animals. And the puppies on the farm...we absolutelu wanted to take Nandomhome with us!! The Argentina Polo Day was undoubtedly one of the absolute highlights of my South American trip, and a at I will never forget. I can only hope that one day I got a chance to return and experience this incredible opportunity again. Wines, delish authentic Argentinian food and Polo...what more could you ask for on a day out in the outskirts of Buenos Aires?! Thank you Celia, Ruben and your team for your wonderful hospitality and for making this a day that when I look back on, I will laugh and smile as one as the best days I've ever had on a holiday."

After a quick explanation of the rules, we headed over to the pitch to watch out first polo match. After a few more glasses and some more empanadas, we enjoyed a few basic lessons in 'horseless polo' in between rounds, and then after the match (thrilling in itself) we got up on the horses and had a go at hitting the ball and riding around, all under the careful supervision of the club members. The beautiful weather helped, but all in all this was a stunning afternoon, and a great break from the city. Highly recommended!"

However, I loved every minute I was there. The owner and his staff were so welcoming, the place was beautiful and relaxing, the BBQ and wine was delish (and lots of it!), the horses were phenomenally trained, and within a few hours I had not only learned lots about the sport but also was playing a game and practicing my technique with a lovely gentleman could Philipe - one of the members of the club who was so helpful.

The drive up was beautiful, the property was amazing, it was green and had the feel of a rustic farm. Ruben was grilling when we arrived and it smelt so good! We first had some of Ruben's empenadas (best we have ever had to this day) and handled the mallets and balls. Second we watched a match which was very impressive. We had lunch and it was great. Ruben is a very nice guy and there was a gal from Germany that was very fun too. The blood sausage was under cooked and two of our group become very ill however we cannot for sure it was the sausage as we ate a lot of other food. After lunch we saddled up and played our own \"match\" it was a lot of fun however we were new to horses and polo so it was probably more fun to watch us than the match we were playing. After the game we took the horses and rode around the property which was nice. The end came and we ended up paying more than we ought to have. I know Ruben could discern our disappointment at his currency exchange so he gave us some mustard and two polo mallets ( chiliean airport police took them from us :( ) We had a great time and i would do it again however i know to bring cash or better yet, Ruben, if you are reading this, invest in a credit card machine!"

Was welcomed by Stef and Alex, volunteers from England who were helping out the Polo day group. Very courteous, who genuinely wanted us to have a great experience. Reuben the owner is a really nice guy who really wants to open up his farmhouse/business to guests and make them feel at home. From the moment we arrived (it was 2 of us, I was a solo guest and there was another solo guest that day) we were offered wine, empanadas and the volunteers/staff ensured that our glasses/plates were not empty. We watched a polo game, got to take a group picture with the players. After the bbq we got to play and that was definitely the highlight. I really had to focus in the beginning so I could get the most out of the experience since I was new to riding. But the volunteers were awesome teachers and extremely supportive. I was galloping, trotting along with my mallot in no time (disclaimer: learning curve for everyone is different). It was a great workout, really have respect for these horses that are very disciplined (My hosre Torito was very disciplined, I just was confusing him since I was newbie rider...all in all fun). Overall this actvity is a must experience (if I had to write a book of the top 100 experiences to do in your life, this would be on it). It was both formal and informal at times with just the right amount of structured activity to make the experience fun."

The volunteers there were really interesting and more like very knowledgeable friends. This has inspired me to return as one of the hosts! Cant wait to come back for all the fun, great wine and delicious food! I cant recommend Polo day any higher."

After a pick up at our hotel, we drove to the polo ranch, while being entertained with a video on polo. Really useful as well, since we all didn't know anything about this sport!We were welcomed with nice drinks and great empanadas (some of the best of our whole journey) and afterwards enjoyed a polo match. While watching everything seemed easy, this was not quite the case when trying it ourselves in the afternoon. Nevertheless, without any previous horse-riding experience, it definitely was a lot of fun!Don't forget to bring suncream, swimming outfit (there's a pool too!) and something easy to wear on a horse, preferably covering all of your legs :-)"

My friend and I love travelling the world and trying new things and this is indeed a unique experience that introduces you to a classic sport of Argentina! Ruben and Celia have designed a fun-fill day to introduce beginners to polo - not just watching a match, but also giving us the opportunity to play the sport. Very professionally run and geared to encourage the most novice of players (and riders) with one-on-one coaching from getting comfortable with riding a horse to teaching us the skills required in playing a real match. They also keep you well fed - the welcome empanadas and bbq lunch (asado) were delicious as well as the unlimited wine and refreshments. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip!"

We had a great time and had a chance to do a lot of fun and interesting things (Cemetery Tour, Closed-Door Restaurant, Tango Class, Tango Show, Tigre-Delta Boat Ride, Day-Trip to Uruguay). That said, the Argentina Polo Day was without a doubt the highlight of the entire vacation and an experience we will cherish for a very long time. Our interactions with all involved were incredibly positive. Celia was very helpful with taking our reservation and getting us set-up in advance. The on-site volunteers (Alex, Steph and Potter (sp?)) were so much fun and both helpful and informative in educating us to the sport of Polo and horse-riding. Finally, Reuben (the owner) was the ultimate host, wearing many hats (literally!) as host, cook and Polo player! The entire experience was first-class from the pick-up at our hotel to the drop-off at the airport. The ranch itself is so large there is more than enough room to ride for both the novice rider to the most experienced. The BBQ lunch was incredibly tasty and filling. For those who don't eat beef, the staff was gracious enough to provide alternatives to the menu to accommodate our dietary restrictions. For those who don't speak Spanish, no need to worry as everyone on hand speaks English as well. If you do only one thing during your time in BA, this is an experience you must not pass up. Needless to say, we will be telling all our friends about it. The only negative was that it had to eventually end!"

I travel to Buenos Aires once a year for business and this past December I was looking to try something new and outside of the city, and with the Polo Open that weekend, Polo fever was in the air. Only going off of other Trip Advisor recommendations, I signed up for Polo Day, having no idea what to expect and with zero polo or horse riding experience. Let me say this, and I will say this one time: Best. Travel. Experience. Ever. Celia and her husband Ruben were the most gracious hosts when we first arrived, everything exceeded expectations. We saw a great match, ate amazing food (best empanadias I had during my trip) and met some new friends. On this particular day a freak rainstorm came through and unfortunately the afternoon lessons were postponed. Any other tourist operation might have just said, well sorry! Nothing we can do. Not Ruben. Instead, he created a warm place for us to wait out the rain, and when it became clear the fields were too dangerous for the horses, we were all invited back at no extra charge. When I came back a few days later, I ended up getting a private lesson to make up for the rain. I was actually happy the circumstances turned out the way it did! To sum it up, I hate tourist stuff. Argentina Polo Day is as real and authentic as it gets. You can tell the passion and love Celia, Ruben and their staff have for the sport, the animals and sharing that with others. I can't wait to come back in October or November!"

From the very beginning the visit co-ordination was professionally handled and executed. We were picked up early from our hotel in BA and transported to the estancia. We were greeted by English speaking staff and fed delicious empanadas and wine (and plenty of both!) There was plenty of room for the kids (10 and 8) to run around, see the horses, and play with the dogs. We then watched a polo game ... the kids got to throw the ball in more than once, and my son got to ride on a pony with a player! Then it was time for lunch (asado), which was plentiful and delicious! They did have veg. options if needed. We all changed after lunch and got ready to ride and \"play\" polo. We were on the horses for almost 2 hours and had tons of instruction. My husband had never been on a horse, but he was able to gallop at the end of the day! After about 7 hours, we were ready to head home after a FANTASTIC day. The only negative was that the pool, which my kids would have used, was filthy. Excellent service, and great value!

She even emailed us after the trip to make sure we were satisfied and to wish us a Happy New Year. The day itself was blisteringly hot but Claudia and the team looked after us so well that it barely mattered. Lots of fine food including fantastic empanadas and Argentinian steak BBQ, drinks, wine and really good instruction in the basics of polo. We got to watch a full game, try out the strokes on the ground, and then give it a go on horseback. I set my standards low not being a horserider and achieved my goal of actually hitting a ball from the saddle.

At the beginning I thought we could maybe have a short ride and shoot one or two balls. At the end we played a real match and we could discover how intense and enthralling Polo is. It is of course better to have some basics of riding but even a complete beginner (there were 3 in our group of 5) can have fun. The horses are very calm and won't freak out in a stressful situation.

I was looking into how to see a real polo game in an arena and stumbled over this, try polo yourself! I was hooked! It was a bit on the pricey side but I know how unique this experience is so I convinced my boyfriend to come and play polo with me, he is NOT a experienced rider. The layout of the day was perfect. Pick up from your hotel, wine and yummy empanadas for a welcome snack. Nice English speaking guides taught us the basics of the sport when the club members had a game. I must say this is high action! Players and horses chase that ball as if there is no tomorrow, really cool to see. During the pauses we practised hitting the ball from the ground.After the game we had a great asado lunch. With our bellies full, maybe too full, we got our horse for the day. We got help from the polo guys to manoeuvre our horses and hit the ball. As an experienced rider I had hoped that the horse was a bit more eager to run. She didn't want to canter unless one of the guides rushed her on. (The horses know who's the boss). But we got it going and with some help from the guide I managed to get a few swings on the ball in gallop and it was so much fun and soo exhausting! I just wished I had better endurance so I could have lasted longer! My boyfriend also had a great time. Having a club and a ball to focus on made him forget that he can't ride so he was chasing the ball like a pro ;). When we couldn't swing our clubs any more and hardly stay on the horse it was time to regretfully dismount. Thank the horses and hand them over to the horse keepers. As the finale we had drinks and chit chat in the shade until we wanted to leave the ranch. No rush from a stressed out driver which was very appreciated.So why am I only giving this an average rating? It's because I want Argentina Polo Day to improve on three things:1: Clean the pool! Would have rated this very good if it was nice and clean.2: Some of the horses was unnecessary skinny. I'm aware that these hoses work hard and are not spoiled pet horses. I also know that there are differences in horse keeping in different countries. But it would have given a way better impression if all the horses looked more well fed, at least to us horse lovers. So less ribs would have got an excellent. 3: Being a safety concerned Swede I think that helmets should have been offered. Even if the horses are nice they are still living creatures that can do unpredictable things and a polo ball is really hard. For our comfort there could also have been gloves to lend.For the price we are paying I expected more in these departments, but I would still definitely recommend this to people looking for a really unique experience in Buenos Aires! ... Just remember to stretch afterwards... ;)"

Her review describes the experience exactly but for me the Argentina Polo Day was even more special. When I booked I let Celia know I would be alone on my birthday far away from husband and friends, and she immediately got into the spirit. So my welcome by her husband and owner of the Polo Club, Ruben and his team of hosts was as ebullient and warm as if we had known each other for years.Moreover, when we were treated to welcome drinks and later a BBQ lunch with wonderful Argentinian wines, the winemaker from Mendoza whose wines are featured during the day, was sitting next to me, explaining the finer details of his wines. My birthday feeling got even better!In the morning we had viewed a 4 chukka polo game, with helpful explanatory commentary from the hosts and after this, we were given short sticks and balls and fell about laughing (literally), trying to hit the ball and not the divots. But after lunch it was our time to get onboard our ponies with our individual instructors.This is a very strong point of Argentina Polo Day: I am a somewhat nervous older rider trying to learn to play polo. My instructor remained flexible and patient when at first I did not easily get into the steady canter and in the end I cantered around with confidence. I even managed to hit the ball with a stick while mounted, a real breakthrough for me! A true birthday present.As a director of a horse riding holiday business in Andalucia (Aguamarga Riding Adventures and The Writing Horse) I also can the Polo Club is run well, with proper gear and attention to safety and the well-being of the horses and clients.And the willingness of the owner and hosts to stay behind, hang out with the guests (by now:friends) and talk over the events of the day is amazingly dedicated.I have booked my return already and this time my husband is coming with me. So Celia and Ruben, get those empanadas grilling, that Mendoza wine flowing and my lovely pony saddled up!! See you in January!"

Furthermore the day was perfectly organized with excellent food, extremely friendly staff and an opportunity to see a polo match and to practice the polo game yourself. For all activities enough time was scheduled. For me personally this was the first time on a horse, which already made it an amazing experience, but the combination with the polo game really made it supercool!

The driver picked us up promptly at 11am in a nice comfortable minibus and off we went on a little over 1 hr drive to the polo fields near Pilar. The grounds were nice and the staff we were treated by exceptionally friendly staff. Reuben started us off with some tasty empanadas and a glass of vino! Great way to start the day if you ask me.Then we got a crash course in polo and its basic rules (I must admit that I knew almost nothing about polo going into this). Afterward ou crash course we got to watch the pros go at it for about an hour. They made it look so easy! (Our host provided sun screen and bug repellent which was helpful). Next we had a delicious as ado lunch and got to know the other folks joining us for the day. Great food and conversation. After lunch it was our turn to mount up and play a match! I have to say, polo is way way way harder than it looks. There's a great deal of skill involved. Getting the horse to go where you want, trying to hit a small not so round ball while moving on a 500 lb animal with a 5 ft long stick. Yea, way harder than I imagined. But, even though I pretty much stink at polo, we had an absolute blast doing it! After our mini match, we took a short ride and rounded up some other horses from a field, which was fun too! Capped it all off with a quick dip in the pool to cool off (it was a pretty hot day).The ride back to BA was a bit longer on the way back due to traffic, stopping for fuel, and we were the last passengers to be dropped off. Nevertheless, we got to nap a bit on the ride back which was good.Definitely recommend this if you are looking for something different to do outside of BA."

I couldn't have asked for a better place to spend it. We watched a polo match, then learned the tricks of the trade. Followed by a lovely BBQ lunch with some lovely Argentinian wine. The horses were fantastic to ride very calm but responsive. We had two beginner level riders in the group and they enjoyed the riding as much as the more experienced riders. We were taught how to hold the polo sticks and have a go on the horse with the ball control and excellent tuition. The friendliness and warmth of the leaders and polo players made it a very special day. Can't wait to visit again !"

If you have a spare day in Buenos Aires and want to do something really different, authentic, and fun, then look no further.So, if you're anything like me, this is your checklist. 1) You're in Argentina and you want to experience polo: tick. The first thing you get is a pretty competitive looking game played by a mixture of keen, expert amateurs and a few ex-pros. 2) You want to understand polo: tick. You have hosts talking you through the game and the rules so you know what's going on. 3) You want to understand a bit about the culture and the players: tick. The players were incredibly generous with their time after the game and talked to us about their background, the polo circuit, and their experiences playing in different countries. 4) You want to be well fed and watered while all this is going on, after all you're in Argentina, right? Tick. Greeted with some amazing empanadas straight off the grill, followed by quality red wine, soft drinks, and the amazing parilla - that was actually some of the tastiest meat I had on my trip. Finally, 5) you want to play polo. No, really, you do. Big tick. Even if you haven't been on a horse for twenty years, even if you've never been on a horse before, you can come here and try a game. This was one of the best things I've done. Reading the reviews, I thought that maybe 'playing polo' would involve trying to hit the ball while sat on a horse. Wrong - it's much more competitive. The ponies are fantastic and suitable for all levels. Tori and two of the grooms played with us and made an effort to make sure we were all involved in the game - apart from Juan, who was just massively competitive, which made it all the sweeter when our 'girls' team scored! It's a little way out of the city - a couple of hours drive from the centre of Buenos Aires. We got picked up from our hotel, the driver was there on time, and the route is on pretty smooth main roads.Celia took care of booking and was a pleasure to deal with - very prompt, attentive, she made it easy to book even while we were travelling. Ruben is your host for the day and his enthusiasm and love for the sport inspires and sets the tone for the whole experience. Tori and Louise were our guides and they were very friendly and knowledgeable. Thank you to everyone!"

For this animal lover this outing was much appreciated and truly surpassed any expectation I ever had when I decided to visit BA. When we got out of the van the first kisses we got were from 2 adorable and sweet ranch dogs. Not only was the host and hostesses warm, funny, and always ready to fill your glass and plates with yumminess, but we played polo! On real Argentine Polo ponies! I wish we had video taped our session. (Remember to do that!) The soundtrack of our game was filled with laughter and broken spanish. The horses were amazing to ride. We were amazed at how they turned \"on a dime\" and would willingly gallop towards the trees if asked. The horses and guests are treated with respect and affection. What's not to love?Ruben and Celia, thank you! I didn't want to leave. ;)"

I always wanted to try Polo and there is no better place then trying it in the country where it is played most with people who have the passion for the horses and riding. We were recommended to the Polo Day by a friend and after a few emails with Celia we could not wait to go. The horses are fantastic and are truly lovely with all level of riders. My partner has only be sitting on a horse once before and he loved it and enjoyed as much as I did. It is honestly suitable to every level of riding. In between watching the guys playing a proper polo match, we had our first go with the ball and stick before lunch. The amazing Asado was unforgettable and the wine just went with it. And then it was our turn to have a go on horseback. After an initial introduction we played our first game and it was thrilling. We also had the choice for a ride through the enclosed fields, which were still party flooded due to heavier rains earlier. The gallops were amazing!!!!We enjoyed every second and if we would have had an extra day in Buenos Aires we would have gone again. I truly can recommend the Polo Day! The horses, the people, the food and the surroundings are just perfect."

Like the other reviewers said, the moment you get there, you are very warmly welcomed, the food and wine are flowing, you watch a professional polo match, and then you get to go yourself. It is all very low-key and fun. We really had a great time. The only thing you should expect is a long ride there and back. It took us close to 2 hours in a pretty cramped van driving from central Buenos Aires to the hacienda. It also took 1.5 hours to drive from there to the airport (and we had no traffic). Just brace yourself for that; it's completely worth while, though."

She answered all my questions very promptly and this enabled me to entice a couple of friends to join me. It was wonderful to have the details of the day in someone else's hand and they delivered all they promised. We were greeted promptly at the polo club with delicious empanadas and yummy wine and Ruben & Tory proceeded to explain the details of the game. We watched a \"condensed\" version of a polo match (due to muddy conditions of the larger fields) however, the players played as hard a game as I have seen. The wine flowed freely as we practiced our polo swings with short mallets on the ground which was a snapshot of the real game. The BBQ lunch was delicious and then it was our turn to play! From the beginning it was an adjustment to swing a mallet alongside the patient horse I rode, but after a little time, everyone's confidence built and we had a blast. I highly recommend this as a fabulous day trip from BA into the country. It is well organized, very comprehensive, and most importantly, exactly what you hope the day will be!! Enjoy!"

We did not know what to expect when we first arrived at the polo field in the middle of no where; based on the muddy conditions and remote feeling of the place we did not expect much. The day ended up being the most fun filled day I experienced in many many years. Being polo fans from the U.S. we were excited to see polo played by an entire team of expert players from the worlds capital of polo, Argentina. Unfortunately because of extensive rains the polo match was played on a much smaller than regulation polo field which was still filled with many large muddy sections. Still is was great to see the players ability to quickly maneuver their polo ponies and the polo ball like they were puppets on strings. After the match we had an enjoyable BBQ lunch, not great food but great people. After lunch we all mounted the polo ponies and attempted to play a game of polo. We all looked like we were moving in slow motion compared to the expert players. After a few minutes we actually were able to attempt playing a very simple game of polo, it felt like riding the bumpers cars in an amusement park. It was a complete blast, I would recommend it to anybody."

The polo-match was great and the barbeque is spectacular. Real argentinian barbeque!

Most polo clubs in Argentina are pretty exclusive and virtually closed to non-members, so the mere chance to get to visit one is a rare opportunity. The fact that you not only get to visit this polo club and watch a match up-close, but also get to get on a horse yourself and try playing is just wonderful! The English-speaking hosts also do a great job of answering questions and explaining polo, so if you're new to the sport (as I was, on my first visit here), then it's a great introduction.Drivers from the club pick you up right at your hotel in Buenos Aires, and then it's a 45-minute drive out of the city to the pretty estancia. If you're visiting BsAs for a few days, this is a great chance to escape the chaos of the capital, get some fresh air, and see another side of Argentina.They welcome you at the farm with fresh-made empanadas and wine and beer, then provide a nice introduction to polo. After that, you get to watch a polo match played by the club members. It's really exciting to get to sit right next to the field, with the horses running so close! After that, there's a wonderful asado\u2014or traditional Argentine barbecue\u2014with all kinds of steak, sausages, and other meat. They also make great grilled vegetables and salads. It's terrific! The lunch alone is nearly worth the admission price. Even at the best restaurants in Buenos Aires, you don't get to actually see a traditional parilla (or grill) like this one, which resembles an outdoor fireplace. It's cool to see. After that, you get a chance to get on horseback and try playing polo yourself. Typically, after about a half hour of getting used to your horse, the staffers will come and play with you. The whole day culminates in a scrimmage between staffers and guests. It's really thrilling! I'm from the U.S. but have been living in Buenos Aires for about a year. I've had a lot of friends and family members come to visit me during this time, and I've taken almost all of them to Polo Day. Again and again, they've told me it's been a major highlight of their trip, and I jump at the chance, each time, to get to go experience this wonderful outing again! Highly, highly recommended!"

The last ride in Salta was no succes, as the horse didn't listen to me at all. Hilarious scenes off me being parked under/in a tree with really sharp thorns, and me desparetly trying to move the horse, whicht off course didn't happen... After 45 min we arrived at the beautifull estate, and were greeted by the wonderfull crew, off course with wine! And the best empanades we had in argentina...maybe, just maybe, the horseriding will be ok today. We watched a game and got an explanation. It turned out that polo is quite rough and very fast! Off course there were only people in our group who could barely ride a horse, so we had no hope off actually hitting the ball or playing a game. After a great lunch we got on the horses. The horses were great as the reacted actually! No dumb following the leader, but actual riding! After 20 minutes off practising we all got the hang off it and decided to play a game. Boys against girls, it was so much fun! Everybody could ride trout or even galop! This was awesome, nobody noticed that it rained harder and harder...

We are a family of 5, parents and 3 young girls (7, 5, and 2) from USA with no horse or polo experience. We had searched and compared all top 3 horse activities ranked from Trip Advisor and decided to go with Ruben. He and his team (Mile, Celia, Omar, etc) were the most passionate people!! They treated us like their own family and there was definitely \"no commercial business involved\". They just want to make sure we had the best experience of a life time and WE DID. It was a \"full day\" activity with Authentic Argentinean BBQ lunch and it was worth every single penny (7 and 5 kids were half price)! We were picked up right in front of our apartment, arrived at the Polo club which was located in the beautiful countryside, were greeted with Ruben with the Best Homemade Empanadas we have ever eaten in our lives!! We just kept eating and eating. Ruben could not speak English so Mile, his assistant, was our personal tour guide. She was sooooo gooood with us and the kids (we wanted to take her back to US with us!). There were also 3 small dogs that our kids could not take their hand off them. We were then taken to the field to see professional polo play. We helped Ruben move the bird eggs out of the field. The kids got to throw the balls to start the polo game. Then, we had wonderful lunch and dessert, practiced polo, and the best part was to ride the horses. First, we thought there would be small horses for our girls but no, they all were big horses. We were scared at first but Ruben and Mile reassured us that the horses were tame and the safety was their most priority. Our 7 and 5 year olds rode the horses with Mile and another gentleman. My 2 year old did not want to ride with anyone but me, mom. Oh no, I was so scared but decided to do it as this would be once in a life time experience. They took us for about an hour ride. We went everywhere including the shallow swamp on the field. Mile and Ruben always kept an eye on us to make sure our safety was at the highest. It was the best! My 2 years old slept on the horse. So, we dropped her off. My girls decided to go on their own with no adult with them on 2 separate horses for another hour. My husband had a blast as he got to play polo on the horse. Once again, no one in our family has ridden horse or play polo before whatsoever. The girls did not want to get off the horses. And, Mile made sure that they could ride as long as they want. They would never ever rush us to end the day. Around 6pm, we all decided that we had enough. The hardest part was to say goodbye as we felt so attach to everyone. We were dropped off by Omar around 7pm right in front of our apartment. The girls said they wanted to come back to visit Ruben, Mile, and Omar again. Sure, if we come back to Buenos Aires, first thing we will definitely do is to visit our friends at Argentina Polo Day!!"

Looking forward to getting out of the city for the day, we did Argentina Polo Day a few weeks ago as part of an extended stay in Buenos Aires / Argentina. The pick-up in the city was in a comfortable van and on time (and not until about 10:30am, to let us sleep in after a Friday night out!). It was refreshing to get out of the van at polo club in the \"campo\" - about an hour outside the city, and everyone there was super friendly and helpful, and a ton of fun. The two hosts did a great job integrating our group, which was 6 backpackers and a family of 4, and it was great to meet and the share the experience with other travelers. It felt very \"authentic\" to drink mate while watching a game of polo at the polo club, then relax for an asado lunch. The highlight, though, was definitely the chance to play a \"real\" game of a polo with the rest of the group, the two hosts, and one of the guys from the club \u2013 although I personally couldn't go too fast on my horse (I'd only ridden about 5 times ever before), the game was much \"realer\" than I expected! Highly recommend the experience overall \u2013 one-of-a-kind if you're spending any time in Buenos Aires and / or Argentina!"

Once we arrived we were greeting by the AMAZING staff. We got a brief on the game and all of the rules while sipping on Malbec and eating baguette, cheese and meats. We were then escorted to the field to watch professionals play. Between each chucker, we practiced hitting the ball with mini mallets. After the game we were treated to a real authentic Argentinan barbecue - WHAT A TREAT! I have never seen so much meat in my life! After lunch we warmed up over some hot coffee and made our way back to the field. We had a very brief lesson on how to ride the horses and hold our mallets properly and then we were off! I don't remember laughing and smiling as much as I did on that field! A great day for anyone who likes a little adventure!"

My boyfriend and I had several questions and Celia couldn\u2019t have been better to communicate with. Don\u2019t miss this experience!!!Recap of the day: You are picked up in the morning right from your apartment/hotel and then off to the ranch which is about an hour drive. They keep the group of people relatively small and we met great people, so that was a great bonus. You arrive at the ranch and you are greeted by everyone who is part of the Polo Club ran there and handed wine and empanadas (pretty much the best ones I had in Argentina). Then you watch the club members play a match (continue to drink wine). Beware there are LOTS of mosquitoes. I was eaten alive!! Wear thick jeans even if it\u2019s hot. They have bug spray there. After watching the game you are lead to the large tables outside to eat carne asado style. It\u2019s delicious and the guy cooking is a former chef. There so much to eat you will be stuffed. After all of this you have the chance to play polo yourself. There were a few people who had never been on a horse including my boyfriend, but don\u2019t worry, there are several people to give you advise and quick lessons on how to ride and play. There are also several horses and they will change your horse if you need a better one. After an hour or two riding you are done for the day (drink more wine if you want) and then you return tired and fully satisfied to BA."

We had just finished a 10 day horse trek and so we were feeling very confident on horse back. Ruben, therefore, kindly let us join in the match on the second day and we played a few 2-on-2 matches as well. There were beginners in our group too though and they were given much more help on the horses which were all safe and well-trained. Ruben and Mile are HYSTERICAL and made the 2 days such fun and a great Argentinian memory for me and my husband. The food was also amazing - Ruben does the best asados!My only suggestion would be 'Don't book a tango lesson after 2 days of polo' - you may need an evening off to soothe your muscles...Ruben and Celia - we will be back next time we're in Argentina!"

Pick up from our hotel was great - on arrival the facilities were at best basic, with insufficient equipment to go round (my wife wasn't offered boots despite two other girls who already had appropriate footwear being given some - same went for actual polo mallet later). We were grouped into those who had and had not ever ridden before, although I'm not sure why - the distinction meant nothing within 5 minutes. The horses were spirited polo ponies and were not suited to beginners AT ALL. Safety was given scant regard - there were not enough helmets to go around and so a good few of us (me included) had to go without. Given that one fall from a horse can break your neck, this wasn't reassuring. The lunch was pretty low quality and the pool at the ranch was not the one on the advert...in fact it was full of debris and looked at first glance like a drinking pond for the horses. I could go on.Interesting day, but not recommended unless you can ride."

I wasn't sure what to expect. It ended up being the highlight of my trip! The club is located about 40 minutes outside of town. They picked me up at my hotel. On arrival, an English-speaking guide met us and we (there were three guests that day) were given the opportunity to wander around the grounds. There is an asado area were lunch was being set up. A \"club\" area with a living area, restroom, and some beds upstairs for overnight guests, and of course, area for the horses kept on site.After we were given drinks (It was a bit too early for the wine offered, and I wanted to be able to stay upright on my horse later.), we were led to the smaller of the two polo fields maintained there. A table and chairs were set up and waiting. Two teams assembled, and we watched a polo match. I knew nothing about polo, so it was as educational as it was entertaining. Our guide explained the rules as the game went on. Polo is much more intense than I ever imagined!After the game, we had a wonderful asado cooked by the proprietor. It was great. Then the wine flowed. (I needed a little confidence for what was coming.) After lunch, we were given instruction on how to hold the mallets and generally the basics of playing the game, saddled up and went back to the field. Some balls were thrown into the field, and we started learning to play the game. (It's not nearly as easy as the veterans made it look, but not so hard that you couldn't whack a ball occasionally.)After a half hour or so of getting use to swinging a mallet from the back of a horse, we divided into teams and played a game. Each team was filled out with experienced players. It wasn't a particularly competitive game (other than to Diego, who felt obligated to prevent my from striking the ball every time I seemed to have an opening!) from a scoring standpoint. We chased the ball up and down the field and occasionally, goals were scored. It was simply amazing. I had never ridden a horse in such a manner, and when combined with the coordination it requires to hit the ball or prevent your opponent from doing so (defense plays a huge part in the game), I was completely absorbed. I played aggressively (I had Diego to contend with) to make up for my lack of skill. The experienced players toyed with me, but it was all in good fun. I had a ridden horses quite a bit, but that's not required. You play at your own pace. If you don't want to mix it up with the experienced players, you certainly don't have to.After an hour or so of playing, we went back to the club for refreshments. Depending on how you play, the game can be pretty demanding. (And think about the horse!) Anyway, it was an absolute blast. I would have gone back the next day.This is truly a don't miss experience. Argentina is the epicenter of world polo. This opportunity to learn and actually play a sport that is played in so few places in the world is really a treat."

It was truly amazing how nice and hospitable Ruben and his staff were to make our day memorable. A bit skeptical that this was going to be a tourist trap but to be honest it was far from that it was a day to remember. The reality was that this was a great way to learn about Argentina and its love for Polo. After weeks of research I selected this company because of the opportunity not only to play Polo but to see a game of Polo.The day started off by Ruben( the owner) sharing with our group the facts and basics of Polo and of course a few glasses or wine and oven baked empanadas. This is always a great way to welcome any guest with food and wine!After our warm welcome our group was seated on the sidelines of the Polo field to watch the Polo match with more wine and empanadas. It was so much fun, and amazing to see a a game in full action as it was my first time and I had front row seats. More than the front row seats I gained an appreciation for the players and the horses as this is truly a difficult sport.After the Polo game we celebrated with a fabulous lunch with the players and Ruben. Not sure why other people have said that the lunch was not great because that is far from the truth the food and wine was a great typical Argentina parillada ( BBQ). Loved it!!After Lunch and wine, we all got geared up to play Polo. Wow Polo is a difficult sport that requires strength and endurance especially in 90 degree weather. I truly appreciated the sport after playing it I am only 30 years old and in good shape and it kicked my butt. Thanks to everyone at Argentina Polo day you were all amazing !!!!Thus, I truly recommend Ruben and his company to anyone visiting Argentina. It is worth the time and money I promise you will not regret."

Ruben, Celia and their team are friendly, knowledgeable hosts who provide a great introduction to so many of the best-loved aspects of Argentine culture: polo; delicious asado (bbq), wine, and empanadas; and leisurely afternoons in the sun. I have been living in Buenos Aires for several months and this is one of the most interesting things I've done - not least for the opportunity to get on a horse and take a crack at playing polo. The Polo Day site is less than an hour from Buenos Aires, but worlds away with lots of green, fresh air, and quiet. It's a really unique and authentic experience - the whole team is Argentine and everyone grew up with horses and polo - definitely a worthwhile break from the crush of the city (and they will arrange transport!)"

But thats not all, you rest at a pool before you head back to the hotel.

The ride out was a little nerve wracking as the driver looked too sleepy to be driving, But after we arrived, we were greeted with wine and a light snack of meats and cheeses. The lunch was amazing, the hosts gracious. The polo lesson was a little loose, it would have been helpful to get a few more specific tips instead of running about and trying to keep up with the best horsemen and the \"real\" polo players. Still, it was great fun. The customer service experience before and after was excellent--a rapid fast response to my initial email, and a willingness to refund prepaid fees for a last minute cancellation.

The whole concept and day activity was memorable. This is a whole day activity. Also, feel free to bring your swimsuit to take advantage of the pool.The day starts with being picked up from your hotel and driven about 45 minutes out to a ranch. At the ranch you are greeted with wine, sodas, and small meat snacks that were fire-grilled. You're introduced to a few of the polo players and you go to the polo field to watch a pick-up game, and even get to participate by throwing in the polo ball. After this is done, you go back to eat a lunch. This was my main and ONLY complaint of the day. I am a healthy eater, but the food that was served, that primarily consisted of many different meats was some of the FATTIEST meats I've ever seen. It literally is barely edible unless you want to eat pure fat. I would recommend to the owners to serve higher quality meats. But there are enough other things to eat to fill up a stomach and as much wine as you can consume. After lunch, you suit up with polo gear (Helmet and shin guards, and polo stick), and mount your trusty steed to play your own pick up game with the others that were a part of the group for the day. We were probably playing somewhere around an hour, enough that the horse gets tired before you, so the time playing was PLENTY adequate.Overall, I would unhesitatingly recommend this activity to do while in BA. There's not too many places where you can participate in such an elite sport. It's a MUST DO!"

All 12 of us were greeted with wine or soda, dried sausage and cheese , and empanadas. Then it was polo time.(more wine). The game was explained by Rosie,an accomplished equestrian from England. After the game we had lunch under a covered patio with steaks(excellent) and sausages(also excellent) , grilled and perfectly seasoned vegetables,a tossed salad , fresh bread along with more wine. Loved the grilled eggplant.  After lunch it was horse time for the rest of us. I hadn't been on a horse since I was thrown from one years ago. I did manage to get on and feel somewhat confident about that thanks to Janie another great rider who works there.Some of our group were very good riders and had ridden and played before but most of us hadn't. The horses were very docile. After our \"polo\" game we returned to the main house to cool off in the inground pool. If you are looking for a fun day spent on a beautiful estancia, try this for a memorable and fun experience."

She can speak several languages so deals with the guests as the owner of the club can only speak Spanish. She was excellent, really friendly and full of chat. She gave us some wine and empanadas and we sat down to watch a game of polo between club members. This was a good chance to relax and learn the rules. Rosie was able to answer all of our questions on the rules etc.After the game we sat down for lunch which was a BBQ of various Argentinian meats - steak, sausages, chorizo, black pudding. It was really nice. This was served with salads and more wine.Then in the afternoon we had a mini game of polo ourselves. All the gear is provided. You should just be sure to wear jeans and not shorts. We were novice riders so we started with basic riding tips and then practising hitting the ball. Then we had a short game. You won't be turning pro after it but the club members and Rosie make it fun for everyone no matter what your level of riding.I would really recommend trying this activity. It was one of our favourite things from a month of travelling around Argentina."

We felt pretty posh eating and drinking wine while watching the match. It was very cool to watch experts. Afterwards we had lunch. To be honest the lunch wasn't very good. It consisted of a very simple salad, a few sausages and very fatty ribs. We were hoping for a little more especially with how much we paid. But we quickly forgot about it when we got on the horses. Playing polo was amazing although a little more instruction before getting on the horse would have been beneficial. We ended up having a blast and had a great day. Keep in mind they only take cash which was a little inconvenient. And it's definitely better to pay in American dollars. I would definitely recommend this to everyone!! Have fun!"

To which I reply: Soy de Nueva Zelandia and normally their face lights up and the next word they say is: Rugby!! Well rugby is to New Zealand what Polo is to Argentina. They are the best polo players in the universe and their national team has not lost a championship since... wait for it... 1932.Traditionally, polo is practised on the family estancias (ranches) all over the country so you can imagine my excitement when I had the opportunity to visit Argentina Polo Day at \"El Camino\", a 20 acre farm located in Pilar (Buenos Aires Province) last Wednesday to learn to play polo.On arrival, I meet the owner Ruben, a friendly and polo-passionate character who looks like he's just stepped out of a Ralph Lauren advertisement. The first thing he put in my hand after shaking it was a glass of Malbec Argentine wine and then an empanada, freshly from the coal fire bbq. He explained the format of the day, firstly a snack and refreshment, followed by watching an exhibition polo game and then anasado (traditional Argentine bbq) for lunch and finally it would be our turn to get on a horse and whack mallets.As we sat on a shady spot on the side of the pitch, one of the English speaking hosts, Rosie explained the rules to me. Imagine playing hockey on horseback and you've got a pretty good picture of what polo is like. But it's much harder than hockey because there's no goalie and only three or four players per team. Plus there's the fact you're trying to convince a four-legged animal to chase a ball and risk a mallet in the head for their efforts. (Even the horses wear shinguards.) The outdoor polo field is 274 metres long and 182 metres wide, the largest field in organised sport. The game I watched involved three people per team team and four periods, called chukkers of ten minutes each. They have to swap the horse every chukker so that means for six people you need 24 horses, no wonder it's a game for the rich and famous! Players are given handicaps like in Golf and they range from -3 (beginner) to 10 (pro). I was at 'El Camino' with a lovely French family on their holidays and while it was their first time playing polo, they have horses back home that they regularly ride. Watching the players hurtling towards each other, mallet weapons flying, I began wondering if playing the dangerous sport of polo would be covered by my travel and health insurance!? My fear was sidetracked by a delicious asado of barbecued ribs, chorizo sausage, salad, slow-roasted veges and of course, Malbec vino. It's a beautiful outdoor dining setting and after a leisurely lunch we kitted up for the game ahead.The French family and I lined up for a team photo, leaning on our bamboo mallets and the next thing I knew I had mounted a horse and was on the field. We started with some stick-and-ball where you repeatedly practice trying to hit the ball along the ground. The coordination necessary to get your horse at the right distance from a moving target, leaning down, making contact with ball and not falling off the horse is quite immense. However after 10 minutes of gentle hitting (and missing!) the game begun and the groomsmen all joined in and showed us the ropes and reins of how to play. I'd like to say I was a pro instantly but like other high-skill sports like golf or surfing, there's a steep learning curve. However, the best bit for me was that even as a complete novice I was able to trot around the place, making occasional ball contact and enjoying the thrill of the game. The horses are incredibly well trained and after half an hour I wasn't even thinking about the riding part of it, just the chasing and hitting.The Argentina Polo day crew love polo, they live and breathe it every day and are happy to share their passion and expertise with novices like me. The food, the exhibition match and the game we played made me feel a part of their world for a day. But never fear Meg (my bicycle), I'm not quite ready to swap my two wheels for four legs just yet!"

I used to be a show jumper in the Netherlands and I would like to learn how to play polo during my time in Argentina. Well, I could say that this place is the perfect place to do so! Ruben (the owner of the club) and the others are very professional teachers. I stayed at their place for two days, got trainings, played small matches (calle baby-chacka's) and I even brought 20 horses from the pampa to their stables riding on another horse. Together with the great meals, swiming pool, sleeping facilities and the members of the polo club (who are hanging around the club during the day and are really interesting people) makes these two days an unforgetable experience!"

You learn about Polo from a wonderful couple (a real Argentinian Polo player & his very nice and smart MBA wife). They welcome you to their little horse ranch, 45 min outside the city. You watch a Polo match, have a hearty bbq, try your hand at the game and meet some interesting people along the way! It doesn't matter if you don't know how to ride a horse, they will help you. If you do know how to ride, all the better! If you're already a novice player, you can sign up for their extend stays offers.All in all, for the price, convenience and the great pictures... I would highly recommend it for those who have limited time but want to experience all things Argentinian!Enjoy!"

Ruben is an ex-chef so he served us very good meals and amazing asados after each game of course!For polo players this is definitely the right place to play and progress outside of BA, in a friendly athmosphere.

We booked the day of polo but when we got there and realised you can stay overnight at the camp we wished had done that. Reuben and celia, the couple who run the camp (along with their cute little daughter), were so friendly and welcoming. We were made to feel at ease as soon as we arrived with a welcome of wine and juicy empanadas. The wonderful Rosie, who is the jewel in their crown at the moment (a young English girl who has lots of experience with horses and plays polo as well as any argentinian male), explained everything to us and helped us learn the rules of the game while watching a match between some club players which was a pretty full on passionate affair. As two girls with little or no horse riding experience it was encouraging to have rosie there to help feel less daunted by the prospect of playing polo!! Over lunch - a stream of barbecued meats and veg with plentiful wine - we got to know the family and some of their polo playing friends better and relaxed in the gorgeous surroundings. Afterwards we got kitted out ourselves and got straight on to the horses. Having never ridden in my life, Rosie made me feel totally at ease. I was initially disappointed that there were only 3 people in the group one of whom was my friend. But we got lots of attention and one of the polo players even took my camera and took lots of photos of us playing polo. We got a little instruction as to how to ride the horse but the animals are so well trained, within a few minutes we were being shown how to hit the ball. It was so much fun, although we played a limited game as my friend and I could barely get the horses to trot while the other guest was a show jumper. He was staying for 2 days to learn polo and improve his Spanish. All in all we got a bit of everything: a day out of the city, eating great food, learning about Argentinian life, watched a bit of polo and played some ourselves. Oh and all in the company of wonderful warm Argentinian people (and Rosie). We highly recommend this day!! Ps oh and if you don't want to get involved you can chill out by the pool so bring your swimming stuff!"

They picked myself and two friends from our hostel, we picked up other people along the way. I was a little worried that it would be lame because they picked up some unathletic types. It's about an hour outside the city. We arrived to a polo field greeted with best empanads I've eaten down in Argentina. The wine was legit too. As much as you could eat and drink. We watch a polo match, the rules were explained to us in English, but we were to busy stuffing our faces and drinking. Rueben, the owner, road over to us and said hello. He was playing in the match. After the match we went over to the farm house for an argentine BBQ. Here my friends and I ate like a fat kids in the candy store. Food was great! Talked and laughed. Chilled out for 20 min after the BBQ, then we suited up for Polo. I was wondering how it was going to go. The game or match was intense when we watched it. We are all athletic but have zero horse experience. Plus the other people that came had even less by the looks of it. They took us to a field after a short instruction on how to ride a horse, like a 30 sec on how to do it. We played with rueben and the other polo players. They helped us and played to everyone's level. I laughed so hard it hurt. Rueben is hillarious and cheats like crazy. I scored 3 goals, no big deal. Even the people that were really out of their element had a great time. One person did everything but played and she loved watching us. We played for almost 2 hours. I was tired and ready for some schlep. If I ever go back, it's a definite. The things I would do differently are bring a glove for your dominant hand that you swing the polo stick with. Like a batting glove or golf glove, wear jeans although my buddy wore board shorts, and if your have boots with a heel like cowboy boots. I wore sneakers and it worked. Just would've made riding the horse easier. The have gear but it's limited and plus it doesn't fit 3 meat head guys that well. It was awesome and well worth it. Plus I won't feel like a poser when I wear a polo shirt next time."

First off, I'm afraid of horses and have never ridden one but I'm so glad I decided to do this. Everyone at the company is super nice and offered us wine/empanadas as soon as we arrived at the ranch. The next hour consisted of us watching them play competitive game of polo while teaching us rookies about the rules. The following BBQ lunch was delicious and it was fun to be able to kick back and learn more about the Argentinian culture from some true locals. We spent the last hour or so actually riding the horses and playing a \"game\" which must have looked ridiculous to an outsider since most of our horses were walking -- only because they knew we were beginers. The instructors were great! They were helping everyone individually and by the end of the session I was much more comforatable on a horse and really having fun. I recommend this for anyone with a spare day in Buenos Aires!!!"

The cost is $160 (at October 2011, the owners say they have to re-price things often due to persistent inflation in Argentina) which includes transportation to and from your hotel, all you want food & drinks/wine, private polo match as a spectator, one-on-one polo instruction and horse/equipment rental. They pick you up right at your hotel and the drive is about 45-60 mins with a friendly driver (if you speak a little Spanish). I knew right off the bat this was a very family-centric small business as one of our passengers was the driver's daughter. You're greeted with homemade empanadas right off the grill and a nice glass of Malbec, and after quick introductions and an explanation of the basic rules you watch a polo match between two amateur teams. The owners explain that they basically run this as a side business solely to cover the costs of team travel and caring for the horses - these guys are super passionate about polo and don't run this for a profit, just enough to allow them to keep doing what they love. After the match you have a terrific asado (grill-out/barbeque) which they try to keep feeding you until you beg them to stop. Some of the neighbors and polo players from the match joined us for lunch as well and were very friendly and happy to answer questions about polo and their country in general. After lunch you put on your equipment and get some instruction on how to ride / steer the horses and proper swinging technique. Then you're basically let loose to practice hitting the ball on the run as well as getting a good feel for your horse (its remarkably intuitive after just a few minutes, the horses are incredibly well-trained...and understanding of beginner riders). The instructors and staff ride alongside you giving tips, hitting the ball to you, etc. After about a half hour of practice you get to play your very own match on a shortened field with a mix of staff and pupils on each team. Incredibly fun and our match got pretty heated quickly, I hadn't ridden a horse in probably 10 years or ever attempted to play or watch polo and yet I got caught up in the game and immediately understood why the owners love it so much. They also run a week-long polo camp where you stay on-site which I would be sorely tempted to do if I can ever make it back for a long period of time (it also sounds like this doubles as an immersive Spanish course for those looking to improve their language skills). At the end of the day you're driven right back to your hotel....and I have been thinking about this experience ever since."

This includes return transfers to your hotel, welcome glass or wine on arrival, empanadas. You meet the guys and make your way over the the polo field to watch them play some chukka's. From there you head back and have a Argentinian BBQ (a meat lovers dream) along with salad/vegetables. If like me you dont eat red meat you're in trouble however within reason email the guys and let them know any requests Im sure they will adapt if needed.After lunch you get a chance to mount a horse and under guidance they will teach you how to play polo.

I had never ridden a horse before, but wanted to join some friends to travel outside of the city. We were recommended Argentina Polo Day, which ultimately surpassed all of my expectations. Travel was provided to and from the polo field, which is less than an hour from the heart of Buenos Aires. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the owners with wine and all-you-can-eat traditional Argentine empanadas. As we sipped on wine and delicious food, we listened to an introduction about the game of polo. It was not long until I was able to get on my own horse, ride her around, and then add in the polo stick to begin playing!! Having no prior experience with horses, I had never expected to be able to play. The horses were very calm and we had great instruction. After a few hours of getting acquainted, we took a long break to enjoy a classic Argentina barbecue (\"asado\"). It was absolutely delicious, and gave us the opportunity to get to know the rest of the group. The rest of the day consisted of more polo and horseback riding, chatting with other people in the group and the owners of Argentina Polo Day (who made the day a laid back, comfortable experience), and watching a live match! When our car arrived to pick us up in the evening, I did not want to leave! I would highly recommend this adventure to anyone visiting the greater BA area. It is an opportunity not to be missed."

It was one of my most memorable experiences in Argentina -- it combined polo, horseback riding, asado (BBQ), history, and a fresh breath of relief from the hustle and bustle of Buenos Aires. My friends and I went on perfect Saturday. In the morning, Celia at Argentina Polo had helped arrange transportation for us from Buenos Aires to the estancia (ranch) which is about 50 minutes away from the BA city center.Once at the estancia, we were greeted personally by Celia and Ruben, the owners of the estanica. The welcomed us with freshly baked empanadas and delicious red wine and took us on a tour of their beautiful property. It was so picturesque - there were dogs, a little girl, a swimming pool, BBQ pit, and green pastures / clear blue sky...the air felt so much crisper and cleaner!!After an introduction to polo, we were soon on wards to our ridding lesson. We each got on a horse without much delay. There was a mix of different ridding levels in our group, but Ruben and his team made sure that we all felt comfortable on our horses (which were gorgeous!). They gave us tips on how to handle the horses and we were soon on our way to riding around the campo with our polo sticks. After our lesson, we headed back to the main house where an asado (BBQ) was being cooked for us on the outdoor grill. It smelled and tasted delicious! For the vegetarians in our group, there was also a great salad and freshly grilled vegetables.Overall, it was not only an incredibly relaxing day, but also one where I also felt that I learned something and did something truly unique \"Argentinian\". I would wholeheartedly recommend this, and have already been doing so with all my friends who are going to BA!"

Our teacher - Lara, who was absolutely brilliant - progressed us quickly but always made sure the lessons were pitched at an appropriate level.Very reasonable price, extremely friendly staff and a good place to meet people when you first arrive in the city. Highly recommended."

My experience was absolutely amazing, i don't usually love lessons that are so intense but these classes didn't feel like they were a class, my teacher Guillermo was really relaxed and made the class a fun learning experience. The 4 hours a day flew by and the long break was a really good reset so you don't get burnt out. Everyone i met and all the staff were very nice everyone makes it feel like one community. Overall my experience was fantastic and if i get the chance, i will be returning."

            "review": "Great school and staff; very challenging learning Spanish as a beginner in group lessons. My experience learning Spanish at VAMOS Spanish Academy as a beginner was mixed: pleased and happy with the staff and registration process, but frustrating and challenging as a beginner's speaker taking \"beginner's\" group lessons with those who were much more advanced than me. I heard similar experiences and frustrations from other beginner's speakers at VAMOS as well. My experience became less frustrating and challenging once I switched to private lessons, which I wish I had done earlier! There was another beginner's speaker in my class who dropped out of group lessons in my class, because it was too advanced as well so I know I was not alone in this experience.If you want to take Spanish lessons as a beginner (meaning you have ZERO Spanish / Latin / romance language experience and knowledge) at VAMOS academy, then know your goals and expectations and convey those clearly to Meaghan Rowland (the school administrator) before signing up. For example: do you want to learn how to read and write perfect Spanish grammar? Or do you want to learn basic Spanish phrases that will help you get around Buenos Aires and Latin America? There is a clear difference learning how to read and write Spanish grammar on paper, and learning how to speak basic Spanish.As a beginner's Spanish speaker, I first signed up for the beginner's group class and was placed in Profesora Paula's group class. As a beginner I thought we would go over the basics such as introductions, ordering food at restaurants, buying things at shops and grocery stores, and asking for directions. But I was surprised to find that we jumped right into Spanish grammar and conjugations, and even the instructions on paper were written all in Spanish with no English translations. Profesora Paula was diligent and professional, and focused her teachings on Spanish grammar with some conversational group exercises. It was intimidating for me to be in a class full of Europeans who were fluent in other romance languages (French, Italian) and a couple of of the students in my class spoke 4 - 5 other languages. They seemed to pick up Spanish conjugations and grammar quickly, and I was surprised they were placed in a \"beginner's\" class. More than half of the time, I felt lost and was embarrassed to speak up in class. At one point I even dreaded going to class because I couldn't keep up with the other \"beginner's\".I switched to private lessons after realizing after 1 week of Spanish grammar lessons, that I still could not have basic conversations around town in Buenos Aires but knew how to read and write Spanish conjugations. Thankfully, my private lessons with Profesor Guillermo made a huge difference and helped me improve basic conversational Spanish drastically. Profesor Guillermo was enthusiastic, patient, fun, and fantastic overall. He understood that I wanted to learn basic Spanish conversational skills without perfecting the grammar and conjugations, that would help me get around Buenos Aires and Latin America. My only regret was not switching to private lessons with Profesor Guillermo early on and speaking up earlier! Meaghan Rowland, the school administrator, was good to work with as well. She was professional, friendly, and fast at responding to emails and inquiries. I appreciated her help with registration, set up, and follow up. My recommendation for VAMOS is to separate \"beginner's\" Spanish speakers into 2 groups:1. Beginner's Spanish speakers who have Latin / romance language experiences, and can pick up Spanish must faster than others. Especially Europeans who already speak 4-5 languages. 2. Beginner's Spanish speakers (typically from the US, UK, Australia, etc.) who have ZERO Latin / romance language experiences. They move at a much slower pace and need patient teachers, compared to teaching multi-lingual Europeans who pick up languages much faster."

We were complete beginners without much prior knowledge of Spanish. We took group classes and classes were as promised always a max of 6 people, all our weekly classes were 4-5 people which is small enough to guarantee a good learning experience for everyone. Our teacher Rosario was great, we made lots of progress and she focused on giving us enough time to practice talking, while not forgetting basic grammar. Location of school is great, very close to the popular Palermo neighborhood. School premises are dated but charming that way, so don't expect any luxury or great facilities. The staff more than made up for any shortcomings in that area, great activities on offer after school without pressure to participate, and a very helpful business manager - thanks ben for all your help and tips. Much recommended school for its fun and informal atmosphere with students of all ages and from all over the world."

It is one of the few language schools that is located in beautiful Palermo and is therefore not only located in a safe area but also in the middle of the district with the best bars, clubs and shops so that you have everything you need.From the very beginning I felt very comfortable, the team is really funny and caring and the most important thing: they are really professional! I didn't expect it to be so organised and structured, but you really feel that they want to learn you something! I had two amazing teachers who were more than patient with us all but forced us all the time to talk, talk, talk. The big focus on conversation was what I loved the most, because within a very short periode of time we were all able to talk, comunicate and have conversations with locals. The level was perfect for me, never too easy, never too difficult. Despite of that we had all a lot of fun, did some social activities together and the free coffee safed our all lives. Thank you so much for your amazing help. After only 4 weeks with you I can have conversations with locals for more than 6 hours and they are all asking mehow I was able to learn Spanish within such a short time. That's just crazy!!! I would ALWAYS come back to your school again and will definitely recommend you to everyone!! Thank you sooooooo much for everything, you guys are awesome!!!! \u00a1Suerte!"

On the plus side Vamos is in a good location, comparatively priced with other Spanish schools in BA and they accept payment in Pesos. The class sizes are capped at 6 which means you get a lot of attention and time to adk questions.The major downfall of this school is that while my teacher was extremely nice and knowledgeable, the school does not teach past and future tense leaving you with limited spanish when it comes to the real world. Had they covered these tenses even briefly in the first 2 or 3 weeks of school I could recommend them but I cannot, unless your goal is to only studst for 1 week or so and achieve very basic spanish.I hope they change the syllabus, if they did, I could recommend Vamos."

It focusses on providing you as much useful knowledge and information as possible in a short period of time, so everyone can go off on their own. It's not very professional, but I don't think you can expect that for this amount of money. The one thing I did really like was their quick reference card for verbs.- They're very flexible. It's best to take a few weeks in a row, but due to our travels, we always had a week in between, and we would de ide at the last minute if we would return the following week, which was no problem.- Both teachers I had were very good (Guillermo and Agustina), knowing to set the right pace, deferring from the programme when called for and making sure you're as active as possible.- They are very helpful with any other questions you have and they organise may extra curricular activities.- The atmosphere in school is great and they serve coffee/tea all day long.Would definitely recommend."

Having only done a Duolingo course beforehand, it became abundantly clear as soon as I arrived that my level of Spanish was not going to cut it in the real world. Having just finished, I have noticed that my Spanish has genuinely improved and I feel more comfortable both speaking and hearing the language now, although I'm aware that it's still at a basic level. The staff and other students here were very friendly, the building was lovely and the work was practical and created locally. Moreover, all group classes are completely in Spanish. My reading ability has improved dramatically because of this.I can also recommend highly the home stay feature of the course. I stayed with an Argentinian in the next suburb who only spoke Spanish, but who was very patient with me as I improved. It was very pleasant and greatly improved my ability to understand the unique accent of the people of Buenos Aires.I think with more time I could have expected a great deal more improvement, but if you're pressed for time this is still a fantastic choice."

            "review": "Amazing School, Far Better Than Exspanish. I really enjoyed my time here taking advanced Spanish classes on an individual basis with teachers Fabiana and Mara. Both were excellent! After feeling completely disillusioned with my experience at Exspanish, where I had just finished spending a month attending some pretty disorganized classes, I was hesitant to try another language school. But from my first impression to my last, I realized Vamos Spanish is far superior to other language schools in Buenos Aires. Here\u00b4s why:- They provide a level test (not just a worksheet where you conjugate verbs, but an actual test) that is supplemented with an in-person interview to gauge your appropriate level (A1-C1). This level assessment is less important at the earlier stages of second language acquisition but becomes increasingly important as you spend more time learning a language, as you can easily be misplaced (as had happened to me at Exspanish) at a lower or higher level than your actual level. Which as you might imagine would be a frustrating experience for everyone involved. - At Vamos, they use this level assessment to decide where to place their students. At the time I enrolled there were no other students available with a higher than B2 language level. So instead of group classes I was offered individual classes and though individual classes are more expensive than group, because they could not find a group at my level, they honored the group rate while offering me individual classes. This was VERY important! Because at Exspanish I ran into the same situation and was told I would have to pay the difference of the cost between group and individual classes (over 200 USD a week), which had left me feeling burned because it was their fault they couldn\u2019t offer something they advertised. At Vamos, by contrast, I was quickly paired with an individual teacher and not charged the individual rate. - What\u2019s more, whereas at Exspanish and other Spanish language schools they use materials published in Spain and do not adapt them for Argentinian use, Vamos makes all of their materials in house. Moreover, their curriculum materials \u2013 worksheets, etc.- covers the full range of language difficulty. I spent part of my time practicing C1-C2 exercises (oral, written, and reading) for the CELU and DELE (Spanish language certification exams in Argentina and Spain, respectively). Because the materials were designed by Vamos for Vamos students in Argentina, I found they were more relevant to living in Argentina and gave me the opportunity to be familiar with both conversational and academic contexts of the Spanish language. - In addition to using their own materials, Vamos met with me before the start of classes to design a curriculum of what I wanted to cover during my stay. Something that Exspanish never did. For example, they asked which parts of grammar (5 types of se), advanced periphrasis, etc., I would like to focus on and worked with the teachers to have those materials available. Moreover, knowing that I am a student in a psychology doctoral program they chose several language texts (including academic articles) that were relevant to my field (clinical psychology) for conversation practice and vocabulary development. I cannot overstate how much this personalized attention increased the quality of language instruction and this was something I did not receive elsewhere (Exspanish). - $$$ WAIT, THERE\u2019S MORE. You would think receiving individualized as opposed to group language classes with materials made in house would cost way more, but actually I did the math and saved at least 400 dollars by choosing Vamos over Exspanish. I was able to take that savings and buy more individual tutoring hours on top of the 10 a week I originally signed up for. And I increased the number of hours at Vamos because the teachers obviously knew what they were doing and I found the classes fun and challenging. I want to close this review by saying I also really enjoyed working with the administrative staff at Vamos. Maybe because it isn\u2019t a mammoth school like Exspanish or the others, they actually take the time to remember who you are and treat you like a human being. They also provide a lounge with free coffee and water (Exspanish charged their students for cups of coffee :(). I really enjoyed how personable and friendly everyone at the school was. Especially being a more introverted student, the staff encourages students to attend their after class activities. There aren\u2019t as many students at Vamos as compared to Exspanish so the atmosphere is more personalized and collegial. And I might add, living in Palermo, I enjoyed being able to walk or take the subte to school, rather than being stuck in an overcrowded subte at 7am to then walk through the microcenter. I am returning to Argentina for a couple of weeks in December 2015 and will be signing up for Vamos\u2019 classes once again."

However, since it was a beginners class, it would have liked to have learned more practical info, such as how to ask for directions, basic phrases, etc. They do offer a crash course for this though, which I'm sure would be more helpful in this sense. My only other suggestion would be to offer afternoon classes as well as morning classes. I would recommend Vamos heartily though, and would have loved to have stayed longer!"

I have just finished four weeks of group classes and starting from scratch I think I have already come a long way in getting a basic grasp of the language. I'm left with the feeling that my learning experience was really important to the school staff. For instance, in my first week I was the only student without prior knowledge of Spanish, but instead of putting me in another class where I would have struggled to keep up with the others, I was offered one-to-one lessons (without extra charge, of course). Furthermore, classes comprise few students and you sit around a table which makes it easier to feel comfortable.Also, my teacher, Nicol\u00e1s, was fantastic in creating an atmosphere in class that was relaxed, fun and serious at the same time. No question was too stupid or basic and he encouraged us to speak as much as possible in class. You could tell that he was \"geeky\" about Spanish and that excitement really spilled over. The staff make you feel welcome and at home from day one and are eager to give you tips on what to do outside of class and they arrange some nice social activities.All in all, I'm happy about my choice of school and it's certainly good value for money."

Sometimes when I reschedule, I would have different instructors if Celeste was not available.The school is rather well located. It was about a twenty-minute walk from where I was staying.

There were 2 in my class so felt that personal touch I am sure other classes can't offer. Also being for foreigners other non-study workshops on Mate, film and drinking also proved useful to meet other students. My only issue is after a week I thought I could survive in SA!"

We were complete Spanish beginners coming into the classes and felt they went at a good pace while keeping us engaged each day with a mix of writing, reading and games that encouraged conversations. We had two great teachers in our time at Vamos and extended our time at the school twice.Outside the classroom we also enjoyed the workshops which provided insights into Argentina and BA and had lots of fun on the social nights the school organised. If you're coming to BA and looking to study Spanish than Vamos is the perfect place. Also great location in Palermo!"

In the time I spent at Vamos I went from having very little Spanish to holding conversations in the language with most of my Argentine friends as well as my host family. In addition to helping me achieve that goal, Vamos introduced me to scores of like-minded travellers, many of whom I hope to stay in touch with for the foreseeable future. The staff are attentive and helpful, the classes small and fast-paced and the teachers skilled and friendly. When I leave Argentina I will probably look back at the time spent here as the best investment of all made here."

We split our time between conversations, listening activities, writing and reading.

Going to write this in English, considering you may not know any Spanish if you're looking for a Spanish school...Anyway, my fiance and I spent a month at Vamos Spanish, and it was an excellent experience. The staff and teachers are great. Small classes. And a great place to meet like minded travellers. Lot's of advice on the city as well through workshops and knowledgeable staff. Social aspect was great, at least one organized night a week with both staff and students. There is an entrance exam and you can let them know how many hours you've studied so you don't need to start from scratch (but that is an option too). Classes are full immersion, but teachers generally speak some English if you're really, really stuck. What we did was take some beginner classes at home taught in English, which provided us with a good base, and then we started in week 3 or 4 at Vamos in full immersion classes. It worked out quite well, I'd recommend doing the same if you are able to. As a complete beginner dropped into immersion classes it would definitely be tough, but certainly possible.What else...Palermo is a very nice area of Buenos Aires. Definitely recommend staying in the neighbourhood and studying at Vamos."

            "review": "\"Best choice\". After taking classes at Vamos Spanish for almost 3 months, I can say that it was the best decision I could have made to go there. The staff and teachers are very friendly and welcoming. The academic level you will be starting from depends on a small test but especially for me it was important to take classes on the topics that I needed and wanted to learn - so classes are flexible. Learning in groups makes more fun and learning is easier but private classes definitely have some advantages, as you can go more into detail in the topics you are interested in.During the breaks one gets in touch with other students from all over the world an can share opinions and advises. Vamos Spanish also helps you to understand Buenos Aires and Argentina better. After class there are several free courses offered, helping you to e.g. understand the local accent of Buenos Aires or how to get around the city using public transportation. To sum it up - Vamos Spanish is an excellent way to study spanish as well as to learn something about the city and make new friends."

I'm an ESL teacher so I would go so far as to say that I'm an expert on teaching foreign languages, and I was really impressed with the academic director and the materials used in the school. The academic director prepared all of the materials herself, so you're not just working page-by-page out of a textbook, and they use a lot of games, audio and video activities, and the teachers keep you interested and engaged in the class, it's not just lecture and notetaking. I took the group classes and they limit the classes to 6 people, but there were just 3 other students in my class (4 in total). I really felt that even though some of us had different strengths and weaknesses (some people could speak with greater ease, other got the grammar more quickly), we were all at the same level and needed to be working on the same topics. It was a great experience and I would definitely return."

Our goal was simple: we wanted to learn Spanish living in South America. After 3 months of 20-hours a week group classes we are now very confident in our ability to read, write, speak and, for the most part, understand (Argentines have a very peculiar accent!). The best part about Vamos, from a student point of view, is the teaching staff. Most of the teachers are University of Buenos Aires students. All of them are very bright, many study linguistics and literature, and every one is good at, well, teaching. I had 4 teachers in my 12 weeks and each one was excellent. For a few weeks I was the only student at my level so they put me into one-on-one lessons with an instructor; the teachers are great at teaching both group and private lessons. With all my time there I met more than a few students who tried out other schools and were disappointed with the teachers. Every last one of them was thrilled with the teachers here, as I was.From an academic point of view, the material is exceptionally helpful and conducive to learning. Vamos does not use a textbook; you get a looseleaf sheet for every topic. The material is assembled by the academic director who makes a specific lesson plan each week for each group. Do people in the class have issues with pronouns? imperfect vs. indicative? The teacher will focus on that topic for you, with supporting material. At a more advanced level I asked to go over the various uses of \"se\" in Spanish, a tricky topic. The academic director put together a lesson plan and we spent a whole day on it. Also, though I took classes in the busy summer months I never had a class with more than 4 students in it.Last, but certainly not least, the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. Kat and Ingrid were life savers in many occasions, answering all the necessary beginners questions when living in a new city. They also organize weekly movies and workshops, like how to drink mate, how to spot fake money, and how to use the bus sytem, which were invaluable and interesting! Not only that, they alert you to cultural events. They informed us of a international polo match going on, which several of us went to (for the first time) and had a blast! If you're going to study Spanish in Bs As, study at Vamos. Not a single person I met who studied at Vamos and was interested in seriously learning Spanish was dissatisfied. If I wasn't moving on to another country I would still be there taking classes. It was the highlight of my 4-month experience in Argentina."

I did a lot of research online for Spanish schools in Buenos Aires prior to personally visiting Vamos and eventually booking 5 weeks of lessons there. My wife and I were pretty much total beginners and five weeks later ... I won't say we're anywhere near fluent but we've made great progress definitely. We feel confident communicating, albeit not perfectly, with locals during our stay in Buenos Aires. We will be travelling for another few months in South America and can put our newfound knowledge to the test.Our teacher, Luciana, was very enthusiastic and cheerful and that made lessons fun. I think that to get the most out of the lessons (and indeed, anything in life!), you have to make an active effort in learning, and knowing what you want to achieve by the end of your study period, be it 1 week or 3 months. Communicate your goals to the study director and she can tailor your lessons accordingly. We've made good friends with our classmates and are very sad to be leaving.Kat and Ingrid who handle the non teaching admin are very helpful with everyday life in the city, from finding your way around the bus guides, to identifying fake currency, and things to do etc, they are always helpful.If you're considering studying Spanish in BsAs, definitely consider Vamos."

Each of them was very knowledgeable, friendly, engaging and helpful.I had studied Spanish prior to my trip and opted for the private classes which were reasonably priced and tailored exactly to my needs. As an example, during class if it became clear that I was having difficulty with a specific topic, they would literally step out of class for a minute and return with materials to review and drill the specific topic. My goal was to improve my conversational skills and we spent the majority of classes speaking.The class materials were professional, helpful and fun.The office staff was also REALLY helpful and friendly. They not only helped me with issues pertaining to the school, but also helped with suggestions and assistance for activities in Bs As (not just the usual touristy things) and recommendations for travel outside of the city. They also had a daily calendar of extracurricular activities which included everything from practical informational sessions for navigating the city (how to understand the VERY complicated bus system to common tourist scams) to wine tastings, bike tours, etc...I was staying in Palermo SOHO (awesome neighborhood) so the location couldn't have been better, but it's also 2 blocks from the D line Bulnes Subte station so it's very accessible from many parts of the city.

There is a calendar of weekly seminars - usually one a week workshop of some sort - like how to prepare mate, or how to talk slang, which are very nice. There is a Argentinian movie afternoon in the school. Besides that there is event board where weekend trips are posted, or some local events with sign up sheet, but this is not heavily promoted, also many times not reasonably priced, and not many students sign up for the events. Having experience from other spanish schools I missed student life after school. In different school I had weekly \"cafe social\" in the evening, where students had excuse to meet for a drink or coffee and speak only Spanish. Many times students had such good experience that fiesta would continue to dance clubs :), but this also made people closer and a lot of times more weekend activities would be spend together."

My boyfriend and I took an Crash course for travelers and ended up enjoying it so much we signed up for semi-private classes the next week. Our first teacher was very patient with us, especially considering we were on different levels (challenging for any teacher). Our second teacher, Florencia, was absolutely amazing! She was very patient and often stopped her lesson to answer the myriad of questions I had for her, Castellano and cultural questions alike. I almost enjoyed learning more about their culture then the class lessons (hehe, isn't that how school always is?), but honestly it was a great way to learn with her speaking in Castellano (almost all the time) and forcing our brains to catch up and wrap our heads around what she was saying. As I said, we only had a week of classes, but I felt I made leaps and bounds for only one week. I haven't had any Spanish in over 10 years, and my boyfriend had taken a college course recently back in the US, and he said our 3-hour crash course was his entire semester of class! Also, aside from our teacher, the rest of the staff were really great! They were very helpful and accomodating and were also wonderful resources for where to eat or how to get around in Buenos Aires!

Vamos is one of the only spanish schools near the hip neighborhood of Palermo with all the restaurants and bars and clubs. Big plus.The free afternoon workshops are great, too. They're about practical things like making/drinking mate (everybody does it here), navigating the bus system (Guia T is your friend), and talking like a local (slang words and useful phrases for getting to really know the locals, if you know what I mean). It's all in good fun and moreover the workshops really enhance your understanding of the local language and culture.But the real kicker is the staff. They're very professional, friendly and knowledgeable about the Buenos Aires and Argentina. They can help you with anything from where to buy good coffee beans in the city to what to do in, say, Bariloche in Patagonia.

Classes are 9:30-1:30 Monday- Friday and in a great location right off Bulnes subway stop.The teachers we so patient with me and my horrible Spanish that I felt free to just go ahead and try to speak the language in class, even with errors and everything. They correct you but don't make you feel dumb, and that was awesome! By the end of the week I was so much more confident in my speaking and was speaking to people everywhere in BA, from groceries to restaurants. I had taken many years of spanish before but mainly memorized nouns and verb tenses for a test versus having a conversation. VAMOS helped me take that knowledge, build on it, and use it to learn how to speak Spanish. If you are a beginner, don't worry, they walk you through everything and really try to make you feel comfortable. You WILL do a lot of speaking, which is difficult but really the best way to learn. I'd reccomend this school to anyone in Buenos Aires, even if you only have a few weeks- you will learn so much."

From the first moment, Vamos Spanish made me feel quite welcome with their Monday morning breakfast and orientation. My profesora was super helpful and had a lot of patience since I am rather slow at picking up espa\u00f1ol. Even though, I thought I knew Spanish before coming here, I quickly realized upon arriving to Argentina that I didn't know 'castellano.' Within three weeks I was picking it back up again. The extra-curricular activities and workshops also helped me immensely in adapting to Argentine culture. After a month of classes here, not only had my Spanish improved but I felt much more comfortable with my decision to move here. Gracias Vamos Spanish for helping me get accustomed to my new home! Highly recommended."

My husband was reluctant to do a cooking class, but after the experience he was so glad he joined me. The experience was very personal from the planning ahead on what we wanted to cook, to the class and finally to the shared photos and messages after the class. We made pasta (ravioli, spaghetti cut with pasta maker and by hand) two pasta sauces and a dulce de leche dessert. Saul provided delicious homemade appetizers, great wine and wonderful conversation. I am a former teacher and really appreciated Saul's advance planning, but also his flexibility to vary off his plan if need be. I imagine that no two classes are exactly the same. If you want to take a cooking class (which I would highly recommend) while in Buenos Aires, cook with Saul at El Arte de Amasar! We love, love, loved it! Thanks, Saul. PS: I've made pasta at home with great success."

I initially wanted to learn a traditional Argentinian dish (like empanadas) but ended up choosing the pasta-making class because of my husband's interest in pasta. I was more than satisfied with this choice: I learned that Argentina has a large Italian population and is a fantastic place to learn the art of Italian cooking! We made hand-made ravioli and hand-made spaghetti with two sauces: a traditional spaghetti sauce and pesto. I seriously doubt I will ever eat pasta that good in the rest of my life. My husband and I both woke up the next morning dreaming about it. We also enjoyed Argentinian Malbec and a dessert Saul had prepared in advance. Saul is clearly an expert at what he does and is making a living off his passion. My husband and I loved his cooking tips and his company (his English is quite good). He arranged for transportation for us to and from our hotel. Overall this class was one of the highlights of our trip (it is worth the price!) and we look forward to taking another class from Saul on our next trip to Buenos Aires."

We had a great time and the girls are still talking about it. Saul tailor made the class so that both the girls and I had fun and learned, We made the dough from scratch and the filling of the empanadas, then we learned how to do the repulgue (closing the empandas). Almost 4 hours went by without noticing it. Saul made the girls feel at ease, they really loved the experience. They are now ready to make empandas at home! Saul will make each class different depending on who is going. Thi is what makes these classes special apart from Saul who is really personable and interesting. This is not a run of the mill impersonal class. If you are in Buenos Aires this is a great activity to do as a family or as we did a mother-daughter activity. Highly highly recommended.

However, while that probably makes us pre-disposed to a five star, glowing review, I feel it would be the same without that degree of nepotism. In my line of work, I've done a few cookery courses and, inevitably, they're a mixed bag. Mixed ability classes often mean it's real lowest common denominator stuff - I remember one in the US where basically all I got to do was throw already prepared vegetables into a saucepan and stir them a while! - but Saul has a far better judgement when it comes to such things. This was very hands on, and Saul's patience and knowledge and calm teaching practices make this one of the best cooking classes I've attended anywhere. While empanadas were the focus, the conversation moved around baking in general, with many useful tips for all sorts of things that my wife and I regularly make at home. Four-and-a-bit hours whizzed by and we left happy, full - healthily so, Saul's speciality is lighter, healthier food, even when making typically fatty snacks such as these - and bursting with new found knowledge and enthusiasm. It's also a lovely setting in a leafy suburb of BA, that gives the impression of popping around to someone's house for lunch. Which, in effect it is: you just get to make it all yourself, under a very smart and pleasant watchful eye. Absolutely recommended."

Saul is a man with a passion for what he does.We were in BA for a few days before we boarded our Antarctica cruise. I emailed Saul for a private lesson with my wife and I wanted to do a lasagna and empanada.Saul responded quickly and we booked our time with him a couple of weeks prior. He offered to send a car/taxi to the Hotel to pick us up, but our hotel said they could arrange a ride easily so we took that. On hindsight, Saul's ride would have been a better choice as he is located in a residential area and there were a few road constructions underway making finding our way there a wee bit difficult.I wish I wasn't so jet-lagged as it was just my 2nd day in BA. Saul spent time explaining various techniques and variations in cooking the dishes which made the lesson much more interesting. Everything was made from scratch, pasta, filling, empanada shell, the whole lot! Despite my clumsiness, Saul was encouraging and we cooked heaps! To my surprise, the empanadas were good, yes, even the ones out out of my hands..... The lasagna was very tasty too. The real test is whether well be able to reproduce this at home ; )Thanks Saul for a lovely fun evening!"

We started the day with an hour-long tango demonstration and lesson. Learning about tango culture and trying out the basic steps was lots of fun for everyone, even those who were initially put off by the idea. We then moved to the kitchen to make a simple but delicious dessert featuring dulce de leche. Our main project was learning to make two kinds of empanadas (meat and corn) from scratch, with special attention to working the dough. The empanadas were absolutely delicious and we enjoyed them together around a large table in Sa\u00fal's bright and modern dining area. A special treat was a tasting of three different Malbecs and a discussion of Argentine wines. All in all, a great cultural and culinary experience led by a gracious and charismatic host.

I travel quite a bit and have taken cooking classes in a number of far flung cities, but no other experience compares to the wonderful evening my boyfriend and I spent at El Arte de Amasar. What set this experience apart was Saul himself and the total personalization of the class. We had a number of email exchanges to plan a menu -- modern Argentine cuisine, dishes we wouldn't experience at home -- and discussed what we wanted to get out of the experience, our experience level, etc. Once we had agreed upon a menu, Saul went out of his way to provide other helpful tips in advance of our visit (advice on changing money, securing local soccer tickets, beating rush hour traffic). He even arranged for a tango teacher to meet us before the cooking class to show us a few moves. For the cooking class, we went shopping together, picked out meat for our empanadas and stew, bought some lovely wine and then got to prepping an incredible meal. Beginning with tasty pickled eggplant, cubes of cheese and homemade bread, Saul shared core cooking techniques alongside a regionally specific lesson. The evening that unfolded was easily our favorite of our stay and we left feeling more confident in the kitchen and feeling as though we had just left a fabulous dinner party and made a new lifelong friend. Book a class! Tell your friends! The bang for the buck is beyond calculation."

I went there with my wife and two difficult teens that think everything you do with dad is boring. They were surprised big time. First of all, Saul, our host (our friend after that night) arranged a tango class for my wife. Superb!. Then we spent about 4 hours of learning things about food, wine, desserts and life with a wonderful person like Saul. Per our conversation earlier, he made sure we discuss the right menu, dessert etc. He picked up the perfect wine for me. The price was more than reasonable. He went beyond to treat us like kings. Thank you Saul for everything!!"

I have tried this type of food many times in my life and Saul\u2019s recipe was as tasty as a good restaurant in Cairo or Jerusalem. Cooking a Mushroom/oyster Risotto together was fun and there were plenty of tips to cook with ease. Right away, Saul seemed as one more friend to us. With humor and charm, while drinking good wine, we cooked and laugh, we ate and celebrated our time. Thanks Saul, we\u2019ll come back!"

This time i went back withe the specific idea or learning how to make pizza since i knew, by reading his blog, that it was one of Saul\u00b4s, the owner, specialties. Also because its such a handy thing to have in the freezer for a quick dinner and finally because...i just love pizza ;)!The experience was wonderful. Saul was again a fun, funny, cool and full of knowledge teacher. We prepared the dough, salsa and toppings and created around 6 different pizzas that were (forgive me here if i exagerate but it felt that way , maybe the wine helped ;) the best pizzas i had ever had! the experience was great, not only the food but the whole thing, so much fun. I really recommend to try specifically the pizzas\u00b4class since i feel they are not \"ordinary\" pizzas and make the most out of Saul\u00b4s experience (eventhough last year\u00b4s experience was great too!)So my rating is 5 stars and trust me and treat yourself with a night at El Arte de Amasar during your trip!So, as his logo says: Better Call Saul!!! ja!Gabriel"

Before we even met him, he was going out of his way to help us, offering us advice about Buenos Aires and Argentina. As well, he was very accommodating...we told him what we wanted to learn to cook and he prepared a recipe for something he had never taught before (which came out delicious of course).I told Saul that we were very interested in going to see a tango show or take a tango lesson. Saul went out of his way to set up a private lesson for us with a teacher at his home before the cooking class. The tango lesson was so much fun, and the teacher invited us to a milonga the next night!After dancing tango for an hour or so, my girlfriend and I had worked up an appetite so we sat down for some mate and alfajores that we would be learning to make. We got better acquainted with our host and then began to cook. Saul really wants his students to understand the technique that goes into making a successful dish, and spends time to make sure you take those lessons with you after you leave his class. We learned how to make empandas and alfajores...all came out delicious. It was a great hands-on experience, with plenty of time to practice making the food, as well as drink wine and enjoy munching on our creations afterwards. Since Saul's class I have a new appreciation for Argentinian cuisine and I will definitely call him for another when I visit Buenos Aires next time. Saul is such a warm person and he offers a very unique cooking session. Worth every peso."

There is an introduction to basic steps, and they take the time to correct each person and teach them the right steps. They are fun and patient. Both of them speak English, which is a plus ( I am bilingual so for me it is not such a big issue, but if you happen to speak Spanish, Lucia is a lot of fun and a potential comedian...). After the 1.5 hour class we walked to a \"Milonga\", a place were locals intermingle with beginners. The staff at the Milonga are very friendly, and the experienced dancers are very accommodating of the beginners. We truly enjoyed the night, and Gerry and Lucia were very attentive to the group's needs.

I emailed them right away and Lucia responded within the day letting me know of their availability. It was a great price for a fantastic experience! We had an hour long tango class starting at 9:30pm with 3 other couples in their studio before heading out to a milangre (where the locals dance tango) and the whole night was a blast! The dance lesson was just enough of a taste of tango to get excited and learn some basics"

Being a complete beginner they were extremely patient and very helpful and by the end of the hour I had a good understanding of many moves and understood what tango was all about.They took some great photos as well and will let me know when I can visit a Milonga which is over and above the lesson. All in all it was a pleasure meeting this amazing couple, an as an English visiting it was great to have someone who could speak English tooI can only recommend Lucia and Gerry to you!!!"

Having never danced Tango before Lucia and Gerry were quick to put us at ease. To help teach us the steps they used a combination of dancing together and individually with us which worked really well. We had so much fun; Lucia and Gerry are very friendly, fantastic dancers and great teachers! After the lesson they invited us back to watch their newly launched Gaucho show - the first of its kind in Buenos Aires - an excellent performance full of high energy entertainment! We highly recommend Lucia and Gerry to anyone looking for a true taste of Argentinean Tango and traditional Gaucho experience. Thank you!"

We were on a boys trip to Argentina and Brazil and felt we should at least try something cultural. Our teachers, a lovely couple with patience and tango skills. Believe me they needed the patience and lots of it. Did we make progress? I believe we did and hopefully, I will come back with my wife and have another go. In addition we spent several nights with them and some of their guests and students at the Milonga Matilde, a great evening out and an amazing orchestra. Thank you both!"

Lucia and Gerry are very friendly, down to earth and at the same time attentive, professional in their teaching. The milonga was also a very great night out with a skillful orchestra and great singer. The ambiance there made you feel like you could go there every night to enjoy the music and the dancing. A few lessons were of course not enough to master the tango dancing skill, which could take years, but at least it inspired me to continue taking lessons in my own country and to come back to Buenos Aires to do more lessons and seeing more tango shows."

We booked the day before on recommendation of a couple who were staying in the same hotel as us. My husband NEVER dances and when it came to it was terrified. Lucia and Gerry were amazing. Kind, patient and they made it enormous fun. All practicalities worked well and the price included the taxi between studios and club and a drink which turned out to be a bottle of wine! After the lesson they took us by taxi to a melonga (tango club) which was packed full of locals, even though it was mid-week. They had reserved a table and although we were the only students for the lesson we were joined by some of their other students which was great fun. The club was so amazing. A live band, a short exhibition dance were great. But the highlight was dancing. Lucia and Gerry make it possible to get up there with them and have a go. It was nerve racking but an amazing feeling to have done it. We have tangoed in Buenos Aires and to experience an authentic melonga and be able to take part was great. Oh and they take photos throughout the evening and email them to you afterwards which was fab.Thank you both. We will never forget our tango night!"

It was quite a last minute decision but Lucia and Gerry really went out of their way to fit us in to their schedule and we were all delighted to find ourselves in the dance studio later that same day. Right from the outset Lucia and Gerry were patient, friendly and informative and their passion for the dance form shone through. Between the 6 of us who took the lesson we had 12 left feet but our patient instructors managed to teach us a few basics of the dance to the point where we were able to navigate the dance floor without danger of hospitalising each other and with more grace than any of us have ever mustered before. The potential for awkwardness was quite high with a group of 6 english guys but Lucia and Gerry have a lovely way about them and put us all at ease and we all had a thoroughly enjoyable time and all left smiling. Added bonuses to the experience were the photos taken during the session which were sent shortly after and also the invitation to a milonga the following evening which several of us attended and were awestruck at the talent and grace of the dancers there... we even got to try out some of our newfound skills on the dancefloor! I cannot recommend Lucia and Gerry highly enough and will definitely be booking another session next time I'm in town."

They showed my fiance that he needs to learn to wait for me and showed me that I need to wait for my fiance to lead. It was amazing that this class can summarize your relationship and you end up learning how to improve your relationship as a result. Call it couples therapy with dance therapy. Plus the ease of the steps make you feel so sophisticated. We ended up dancing on the streets of Boca after our lessons. Lucia & Gerry were great. This is a must try for anyone visiting Buenes Aires or in a relationship. Much love goes out to Gerry & Lucia."

Lucia and Gerry are great. They want you to have fun and to experience something other than the typical jaded tango shows most tourists go to. NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY. Argentine tango is quite different from American tango, but you will have fun learning the basics. And by all means, DO NOT miss the \"Tango Night Out.\" It's truly a slice of Argentine life. You can see the standard things in BA, but leave room for an unforgettable experience."

We were a little nervous but within a minute Lucy and Gerry made as feel very comfortable. They are really nice, kind and funny. They have a lot lot lot of patience. We were just with 2 couples this evening so a lot of attention. It was a great experience. They want you to learn a few basics of the tango and make it your own. They have there own way of teaching which we liked. And having fun was also a very important thing. The milango after the lesson was a great experience. We will never had visit it by ourself. Dancing up the stage was a little scary but fun and Gerry and Lucia made sure everybody danced once at the floor. It was a great great night. And because of the pictures they made of us we have a even bigger memory of this evening."

Lucia and Gerry very quickly focussed in on the specific areas which were problematic for me and had endless patience in helping me understand and practice the intricacies of this wonderful dance. I would highly recommend them and their Milonga tour night for an authentic and very enjoyable experience of tango in Buenos Aires."

We sure are glad we did. We first took a private lesson with Lucia & Garry. They were great and made us feel really comfortable. We did manage to learn a few steps. Later we met again for a class with 3 other couples and a single man. Again it was fun and we almost looked like we knew what we were doing. After the class Lucia & Garry put us in cabs and took us to a Tango Club where they bought us drinks while we sat and watched couples doing the tango. Garry and Lucia got up and gave us all a show on how it should be done. Then Garry took each of the ladies out on the floor and they did a dance. What a trip to see my partner with a big smile on her face doing the tango with the teacher. Then Lucia got up and did the same thing with the men. We left there around midnight. What a great experience. This is something everyone who visits Argentina should do.I have to add, that while we were there, Lucia took pictures of us. She then sent us the pictures on email. It was great to see them"

I was a little apprehensive to say the least, particularly as I am here on my own, but Lucia and Gerry put me at ease and created a lovely atmosphere in the class. I did a group class which included a milonga tour, and Lucia managed to persuade me to get up and dance at the milonga (sober). The milonga tour was a genuine, authentic event, and much more worthwhile than a touristy dinner and tango show. I took a 1.5 hour private lesson after that, and managed to put together a few steps. It was a lot of fun, and I found them just the right blend between being fun and personable, but giving you input where needed.This was a perfect introduction to tango for me, and I would thoroughly recommend them to anyone looking to give it a go. The whole experience was great fun."

This is your chance to learn the tango in Buenos Aires & dance with the locals in a genuine melonga dance hall - totally unmissable and all in the space of one evening!Gerry & Lucia are great tango teachers - friendly, relaxed & excellent communicators. They offer a group melonga experience and/or 1-2-1 tuition. We were one of 4 couples for our melonga evening, which is in 2 parts - the first hour is spent in their air-conditioned dance studio, learning some basic steps and the etiquette of a genuine melonga dance hall. The second part of the evening is spent in a local melonga dance-hall.It was a Monday evening, but the dance hall was packed with local people and a live band was performing. The standard of the dancing was exceptional, and we could have spent all evening just watching the locals. This was completely different to a \"tango dinner show\" - these were real couples of all ages dancing with genuine intimacy. Many danced with the same precision and skill as the professionals we've seen, but there was a smouldering passion between some couples that lifted their dancing to a different level.But the evening was about participating as well as spectating. One of the couples from our group were sufficiently confident to get onto the dance floor and join the locals. The rest of us were more hesitant, but Lucia & Gerry gave each of us the opportunity to partner with then so they could guide us around the floor. By the end of the evening everyone had been on the floor for at least one dance.We were also nervous that, as 2 Brits in Argentina, we might get into trouble going back to our hotel after midnight. We needn't have worried because, when each couple was ready to leave, Gerry & Lucia made sure they got safely into a taxi and the driver had clear directions with the meter running.This was a memorable evening that's given us an insight into how the tango is alive and well in the dance-halls of Buenos Aires. You really shouldn't miss this experience."

To provide context, leading up to my trip, my life and work has been extremely stressful. I planned a trip to Buenos Aires by myself for a few days until my friends came to join me. At first, I was hesitant to sign up for a tango lesson by myself, but figured it would not hurt to ask. Keep in mind, I've also been to many countries and cities all over the world; so the issue wasn't being by myself, and I'm actually a pretty good dancer as it is if I don't say so myself! But I have never done anything like Tango. Upon sending an email to Gerry and Lucia, they responded to within less than 24 hours. They were extremely accommodating and encouraging and so I decided to sign up as a single student for a lesson. Step one was complete!Step two: getting through the lesson! Allow me to first acknowledge that people, especially Americans, myself included generally do not have appreciation for the history of tango, the movement, style and the methodology. My goodness, not only did I learn the basics to the best of my capabilities, but with Gerry and Lucia's help, I realized that tango could be quite relaxing and therapeutic if I let it be. It was an activity that I needed at that very moment in my life, and for that I am extremely grateful. They are true professionals, but their genuine humanity and kindness transcends anything one would expect from a 1-hour tango lesson. I highly recommend this class to anyone - couples, singles, whomever...you'll want to sign up again and again, and if you're like me, you'll make sure to book your next class the second you visit Buenos Aires :-)"

Gerry and Lucia have a fabulous sense of humor -- they are welcoming, patient, and a joy to be around. The \"Tango Night Out\" tour includes a tango lesson followed by a trip to a local milonga. With the perfect mix of beginners and local dancers we felt like we were able to get an \"authentic\" milonga experience. We recommend this for any individual or couple with a passion for dance and an interest in trying something new. Fair warning - Gerry and Lucia WILL take you out on the dance floor at the milonga to strut your stuff! When in Buenos Aires...!"

My boyfriend and I decided to join their Tango Night Out Tour which included an hour of class before heading out the milonga, the entry fee and drinks at the milonga. We were worried one, one hour lesson wouldn't be enough since it was our first time learning Argentine Tango so we decided to take a one hour lesson beforehand. Lucia & Gerry were very patient with us and very helpful. I loved how they made sure we felt comfortable at the milonga. They captured great photos of us at our class and also at the milonga. I wish I had more time in Buenos Aires to take more lessons with them. Their prices are also very affordable! Try at least one lesson!"

While dancing with Lucia, Gerry keeps a constructive eye so he can clearly provide constructive suggestions. I took 5 classes, 90 minute each, which allowed me to reinforce everything I was taught the previous day. They are fun and teach in a non threatening way. You will have a blast. Note they have moved to: BALCARCE 725, San Telmo. It is directly between the Green and Blue Subte (subway) and les than a 10 minute walk."

We walked to the dance loft, and Gerry even stood outside to make sure we didn't pass their address as it can be slightly hidden. The whole experience was wonderful. Lucia and Gerry even take pictures and video along the way so that you can have some memories of the day. Can't recommend them more!

Lucia & Jerry came back to us by email quickly and set out the programme for the evening clearly. So what does tango night involve? Well a group dance class for an hour, taxi to the milonga , entrance fee and a drink. Good value for the price we paid approx 700peso.We arrived at the class in San Telmo for a class with three other couples. All of different ages/nationalities and all beginner tango dancers. The class was great fun and L & J explained the steps and took us through some basics. They made the class fun for us and were extremely patient. We had a group camaraderie by the end of the lesson. Most of us were still two left feet by the end but we didn't care - some picked up the steps really well. That was down to ability rather than teaching. After the class it was off to the milonga (tango club) - we jumped into pre organised taxis and swiftly entered the club. Now this is not a flashy big production club. It had much more of an informal local feel which created a fantastic atmosphere. The energy from the band really made it. We sat down, had some drinks and stared in awe at the dancers. Then L & J got up to get us involved taking each of us for a dance on the floor. So much fun! Sad for the night to end - but what a memorable experience. J also ensured we got in our taxi ok all the way back to Palermo.If you do one thing in BA it's tango with L & J."

One of the reasons for our trip was to learn tango in the cradle of this fabulous dance while experiencing its unique aura and mystery. In our travels we visited many tango schools and had different teachers. The individual classes we had with Lucia & Gerry were unique in the sense of attention to technical detail, developing better feel and understanding for each other. Through both individual and joint instructions we felt we gained way more from those classes learning not only about our own perspective as a leader or follower but also the view of the other side.While doing that we also had some unexpected aha moments about ourselves, which made it feel very therapeutical.Lucia & Gerry were also gracious to take us to a few milongas in the evenings where we could test our skills in a real world of tango dancing.This was an unforgettable experience which we highly recommend to individuals and couples like ourselves.Ania & WojtekPoland"

As far as the lesson, my only complaint was that I felt an hour wasn't as long as I would like, particularly when the instructors have to divide their attention among a group of people. The highlight of my night was the milonga. It was a real treat to see the live band and locals dancing the \"real\" way. The short professional exhibition was the cherry on top-- and not tacky or touristy at all. You simply can't beat the experience for such a reasonable price.Thank you, Lucia and Gerry, for a memorable evening. Only one thing about the night left a bad taste in my mouth, but it's not something that was Lucia and Gerry's fault. There was one couple among us who seemed to care more about documenting their experience than actually enjoying it! At the milonga they would occasionally glance away from their phones, and the rest of the time they were too busy taking and editing pictures and videos, as well as catching up on social media. You came half way across the world for THAT? Why not just stay home and watch something similar on YouTube? One of the staff even came over and very politely told them that they might \"miss something beautiful\" if they don't look up. They nodded and smiled and proceeded to ignore his advice as soon as he walked away. Sometimes I just don't understand my species. As a tip for anyone in the future, the place we went to is NOT a tourist attraction. I think it was rude and awkward to film the locals dancing--- if you must do it, please do it discretely. Fortunately I didn't notice any nasty looks. "

We decided to do a group tango lesson with Lucia and Gerry to mix it up a bit. I could not have been happier with the experience. Lucia and Gerry are amazing dancers and incredibly kind and funny people. We had a wonderful time learning the basics and joking around with each other. We even went to a milonga as part of the lesson. (Watching Lucia and Gerry on the dance floor was one of the highlights!)Lucia and Gerry really went above and beyond for our unique group, which is indicative of who they are and the business they run. If you're at all interested in taking a tango lesson, do it with Lucia and Gerry!"

We had seats on the first line to see the live orchestra, what's impressive.

We took a private class prior to the tango experience package and were introduced to the basics. Gerry and Lucia worked great together and complemented each other perfectly as the night progressed. After the lesson, we took cabs to Melonga (the cab, the entrance fee and the drinks were already included in the price!). The live band and several professional couples at the Melonga really made the unforgettable tango experience.

My wife and I decided to wine taste before our 9pm class with Lucia and Gerry. After wine tasting, we decided to take a nap before our class and well... we overslept and woke up at 9pm. Still, Gerry emailed me and insisted that we show up. We didn't get there til 9:45pm. They did a 15-minute power session and took us to a Milonga (tango club). But the shocking part was, even though it was completely our fault for arriving late, without asking- they insisted on us returning the next day for a one-hour FREE private class; they wanted us to get a full session- since we showed up late. We couldn't believe their kindness. Such a great couple, such an awesome night. The Milonga club was so cool, and we were able to dance tango with them in front of the live band, even after the 15-minute power session. To spend time with Lucia & Gerry is a MUST if you plan on visiting this wonderful city."

This Milonga had a live tango band, a variety of levels of dancers on the dance floor, and later in the evening, a professional dance couple. Gerry and Lucia each took us out for a dance at the Milonga; Lucia took lots of photos from both lessons which will make lasting memories.

We felt like we were a part of this exclusive club and wonderful dance community. We had a reserved table and enjoyed champagne and very good empanadas. Gerry and Lucia took turns guiding each of us around the dancefloor. The evening lasted well into the morning as a local professional couple gave a brief tango showcase. We left around 2:30 am knowing we had experienced something really special. Not just to learn more about Tango, but to feel how the Tango community keeps this tradition alive.

Jerry and Luc\u00eda made learning the steps for complete beginners extremely easy to understand, and by the end of the class we had done more than just laughing our way through it - we'd learnt a routine! With a little more at-home practice, I would feel confident going out and knowing a few basic steps. Even my husband, who refuses to ever dance, enjoyed himself thoroughly. Jerry and Luc\u00eda are definitely great teachers, making the class fun and well as informative, and also were a wealth of information for all things Buenos Aires.

We also got a chance to see some other experts perform and do exhibition on the dance floor which was no less than a tango show.

The class lasted well past the hour allotted (90+ minutes), and throughout Lucia and Gerry effortlessly mixed demonstrating to us the basics with walking us through the steps. By the end of the class we had 3-4 solid \u201cmoves\u201d to get us started. Further, we then took those moves right to the dance floor, as they brought us to a local milonga where there is nightly tango. The live band was fantastic, and we were able to further pick up some moves from the locals and others who were dancing throughout the night. Though my wife and I were a bit challenged to put all those moves we had just developed into practice when the lights came on, we enjoyed the chance to both try it out ourselves and sit back and watch the masters. A great night for sure, and would recommend it to others as an accessible way to try out tango."

We booked these classes having read the reviews on Trip Advisor and we had a great evening.There were 4 of us (2 couples) and Lucia and Gerry were great teachers, providing a good mix of theory and practice. The style you will learn is the 'informal' style so not like you will see on \"Strictly\" which is more formal. It was great to see Lucia and Gerry do their demos as this gave an idea of how things should be done properly!The lesson was just over an hour and whilst you learn a lot, it's not really enough to feel confident in a Milonga. In fact, if you wish to dance at a Milonga or feel confident yourself, you will need to be realistic and book yourself a few lessons first!Having said that, it's a great introduction and going to the Milonga was a real bonus. Whilst we wanted to have fun and we did, it was still quite intense and scary seeing the locals sway and glide so easily around the floor and then try to recall what we had learned an hour before! This is probably more to do with our personalities than the teaching! There was a 5-piece orchestra, live singer, tango exhibition, and much theatrics generally allround .... fabulous!Lucia and Gerry have a great connection to each other and to the dance - you will be looked after very well. They also organised photos of the dance lesson and the Milonga so you can focus on learning and having fun and not worry about taking snaps!Our only criticism was of the last minute venue change, luckily we had email access. The venue was changed from a central location to a less central area (Tacuari). This was due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control - it would have been great to have stayed in a more central area.If you are looking for a safe and fun way to experience Tango and a Milonga then look no further, we would definitely recommend Lucia and Gerry to you!"

We went through some basic steps whilst they used their easy to understand teaching techniques on us, occasionally jumping in to demonstrate with individuals. in an hour or so i think it'd be hard to nail this dance :) but by the end of the class we were all at least confident enough to try our hand once in the Milonga. The Milonga was in an atmospheric room with some real professionals there, mixed with begginers just like us. There was no stigma to us being there or partaking. Nice wine and beer was provided by Gerry and Lucia and a great band and singer played. We all had a go dancing with either Gerry or Lucia. And some of us went up as couples too, great fun even if we didn't have the moves down just yet!Gerry and Lucia took lots of photos throughout the eve and sent them all to us on an email which was a great touch.

We were planning to include a tango lesson (or more) into our trip to Buenos Aires - and my wife, who was in charge for this part of the programs, decided to go with Lucia and Gerry.Although we do some ball room dancing at home, the \"real feel\" of the original Argentine Tango you can get only at the source. In all our travels we firmly believe in the principle of exploring what the locals do best; e.g. order pasta in Italy, not in America, and eat seefood in Atlantic Canada, not in a landlocked space... etc.We agreed on a package that included one private lesson, a group lesson and a trip to a milonga (transport, admission and drinks included) - in this way they offered even some discount on the private lesson's price. Lucia and Gerry are great and patient teachers and take away the mystery of the \"fancy\" tango moves and steps. Everything seems simple and easy to understand... although they give you the fair warning that every one hour lesson with the instructors should be topped up with ten hours of practice. (But we already knew that from our ballroom experience.)We enjoyed every minute of the lessons, both when in private and and with the quite small group. Probably, not ready yet for a competition dancing but we definitely learned the basics :)The outing to the Bendita/Maldita Milonga was a very pleasant surprise: the orchestra was excellent and Lucia and Gerry took care of the beginners' biggest fear as well - they took us out there on the dance floor, busting our confidence to be able to stand up and dance on our own as well!(the friendly chat with Gerry in the cab on our way to the milonga was just the icing on the cake: exchanging our views about the state of affairs in the world resulted in a nice bonding)Summary: Don't miss this opportunity to learn tango in Buenos Aires!"

We were three women who had never danced the tango, and they made it so accessible and fun! We couldn't believe that within 10-15 minutes we were actually doing real steps! They went out of their way to bring in a solo male dancer so we would have a partner to work with (the others in the group were couples). After an hour or so of dancing we were off to a milonga in San telmo, worth visiting on its own! The \"maldita milonga\" had an amazing live tango orchestra with 4 accordions and 3 violins and an amazing singer. We got to listen and watch the tango experts on the floor...and dance with Lucia and Gerry ourselves! It was a perfect introduction to tango and the tango culture...with the milonga being the \"insider's\" icing on the cake. Thank you!!"

Neither myself or my boyfriend have ever danced, both have 2 left feet and are completely lacking any coordination, but that didn't matter. They took their time with us, explained everything (several times) and made the hour thoroughly enjoyable. Not expensive, great value and something I'd recommend to anyone visiting BA. Thanks guys for a really great experience. Beks&Niall"

I took three lessons and went to the \u201cTango Night Out\u201d with them over the course of a week and am really pleased with how much they taught me in that time. They are both very friendly and patient. I appreciated them taking the time to explain different steps and how to make corrections. I especially recommend attending the Tango Night Out as a preview to your lessons. There was a live band and all the regulars out dancing \u2013 simply a cool way to glimpse the scene and join in yourself. And they make it very easy, setting up taxis to the venue following the initial group lesson and hailing a cab afterwards to get you back safely to wherever you are staying. All in all, it was a memorable part of my visit to Buenos Aires. They even sent me pictures from the lessons and milonga afterwards as a bonus souvenir. Big thanks to Luc\u00eda and Gerry!"

If you're like us, you'll be anxious about having 6 left feet when going to learn a serious dance from experts. Our guide arranged the lesson and we arrived just in time to a room reserved in a hotel. Gerry and Lucia immediately put us at ease with their calm competent demeanor. They quickly got us walking together and then began to teach us the basics of walking when doing the tango. They have a perfect balance of being professional and demanding while at the same time being light in spirit and attitude. Before long they had us appreciating the basics of the dance and, and moreso, insights into what made Tango such as personal experience. We enjoyed the session so much, that we have decided to continue lessons when we return to the states. My wife is extremely happy. I encourage anyone who wants to get exposure to this dance and appreciate what and why it continues to be dance of two people melded into one, this is the couple to go to."

Unfortunately I was only able to take one private lesson with Lucia and Gerry, but it was without a doubt one of the best things I did during my time in Buenos Aires. Both are expert instructors who have a very organic teaching style, so no matter what your skill level you will always feel comfortable, yet at the same time challenged. My hour with them flew by, and that night I also attended a milonga with them and a few other students. This was also a fantastic experience, as it allowed me to get a better sense of how regular people dance tango and of the contexts in which they do. By the end of it all, despite my limited exposure, I truly felt like a had a sense of what makes the tango such a special and important part of Argentine culture. If there is one thing you do in Buenos Aires, I recommend a class with Lucia and Gerry. It was an unforgettable and inspiring experience, and I hope to see them again one day when I return to Buenos Aires."

Patient, positive, supportive tutors. Then the culmination. Off to a Molongo to actually dance the tango. The night we were there, 10 piece live band plus tango demonstrations at the highest level - on a suburban dance floor. Next time we are in Buenos Aires, it will be two lessons and no professional theatre. Gerry, your patience was exemplary. Lucia, to dance the tango with you was the highlight of my holiday. You are, fortunately, so forgiving.But I can now say, I went to Buenos Aires and danced The Tango.Gerry, Lucia - my thanks. MM (Australia)"

Lucia and Gerry introduce you to a culture and style which has been long forgotten in today's day and age. My family of 8, a few adults and a few clowns participated in learning to tango with Lucia and Gerry. To appreciate tango, is to appreciate the pull and push of life, the ebbing and flow of the universe. It is to give oneself over, and at the same time take control. When I first booked this trip, I never realized the impact it would have on me and my family. It was not only the lesson of the tango, but it was the discussion and relaxed atmosphere that surrounded the Milango that one is transported into times past. This is not an exhibition of modern dance, nor is it a gluttoness feast for one's belly, but rather it is an exhibition into the working dynamics of a society and rich culture. Go and enjoy this, whether you have 2 left feet as do I, or are an experienced dancer. You will only be richer for having done so."

We decided to give Gerry and Lucia a try based on the great TripAdvisor reviews and we are so glad we did.First of all, I would highly recommend if you have even a passing interest in learning this dance - or enough of an adventurous spirit to want to enrich your time in B.A. with a truly unique experience - that you book one or two private lessons and then arrange to attend the Tango Night Out with Gerry and Lucia. To be clear, if your time is short, then the one hour class ahead of the Tango Night Out is enough to learn the basics and the Milonga experience is so amazing that you will enjoy it whether you dance or not. But if you have more time, the extra classes will be worth it and Gerry and Lucia are such good teachers that you will have enough confidence to give the dance floor a try at the Milonga.The lessons are fun and completely not intimidating. These two are able to accommodate anyone. I went with another good female friend and they taught us enough to deal with invitations to dance at the Milonga! Both Gerry and Lucia speak English and are very patient with slow learners!The Tango Night Out is not to be missed...no matter your feelings about dancing. They took us to a Milonga we would have never found on our own. We had a table right in front of the band and the dance floor. We watched the most amazing live band I have ever seen and then were treated to an amazing tango dancing exhibition. It was my absolute favorite night in Buenos Aires. Furthermore, when it was obvious that my friend and I enjoyed the milonga so much, Gerry and Lucia e-mailed us with other options for attending milongas later in the week. We felt like we had made real friends in these two by the time we left!The prices are extremely reasonable and the memories are priceless! Don't give this a second thought if you are considering it!!!"

So, we decided to take lessons from professional teachers and we found here the recommendations for Luc\u00eda and Gerry - so, we tried it and it was just really great and so much fun! We booked the \"Tango Night Out\" which include a 1 h lesson before they take you to a real (!) Argentine milonga where you can see, listen and feel real Argentine tango, the atmosphere on the dancefloor and the great live music! But in order to be able to dance a little bit tango in the milonga, we recommend to take extra lessons before the \"Tango Night Out\" so that you can learn a few more combinations of steps. We really enjoyed the time with Luc\u00eda and Gerry who are very patient teachers and lovely persons! If we are in Buenos Aires again, we will definitely come back and take further lessons with them so that we can go again to a real milonga and enjoy the real Argentine tango."

Gerry and Lucia's \"Tango Night Out\" was a perfect evening for us. We had a one hour lesson - just enough to begin to comprehend the complexities and the psychology of the tango! - before heading out with them to a milonga for the balance of the evening. The whole experience was one we won't soon forget - our best evening in Buenos Aires! We're determined to find a teacher and keep up with the tango once we're home, so that we can come back and be one of those couples in the milonga whom we so admired!Gerry and Lucia were great teachers - endlessly patient! - and fun to spend the evening with as well!"

The week before flying back to the U.S. I decided I really wanted to take at least 1 tango class, just to learn the basics and get a feel for it. My husband was a good sport in agreeing to go with me. We searched for Tango classes in English and found Lucia & Jerry. We decided to go for a 1 1/2 hour class. I couldn\u2019t believe how much we learned to do in such a short time. Lucia & Jerry were amazing to work with. They would demonstrate the steps, work with us separately, put us together to practice, and then give us instructive feedback. (They both speak English and Spanish, so there were no language barriers.) They were both so patient with us, always giving us helpful tips and demonstrations. The time flew by. My husband (the one I dragged there) suggested taking a second class the next night. We also ended up joining the Sunday night group class for extra practice. So, be careful! You\u2019ll have so much fun and get hooked!If you are going to be in BA for several nights, I highly recommend at least two 1 1/2 hour classes. You\u2019ll feel the steps really cement and come together the second class, and you\u2019ll be ready to go to a milonga to dance the night away. Lucia & Jerry have great recommendations for milongas to go to. There\u2019s truly no better way to spend a night in BA than dancing tango! Go for it! As an added bonus, while you're practicing, Lucia takes pictures and video of you. You leave Buenos Aires with 2 souvenirs: great pictures and the ability to tango!"

I am a terrible dancer, but Lucia and Gerry were very patient teachers and very positive throughout the whole class. The class was much more fun than I expected and Lucia / Gerry took photos during the class and emailed them to you the next day. This was very convenient as it helped you focus on learning the steps. After the class we went to a tango club a few minutes away with locals and live music. Needless to say the other dancers were much better than us, but it was great to be there with Lucia and Gerry as we would not have been brave enough to go to a club like this ourselves.

I mean, we're still not pro's but, man, my husband and I never knew we can learn a few tricks in the dance floor fairly quick. I was so surprised that even my husband enjoyed the entire length of the lesson. He was showing off his learned skills dayyysss after. LOL.

We got in contact with Gerry y Lucia and soon had three private lessons booked over the course of the next three days. We got four hours for the price of three, though I actually think we got closer to five hours by the time we were done.We learned a lot in our lessons. We had done a few lessons previously, so they evaluated what we knew so far and then set about refining our technique, teaching us some more compact ways of doing things for the crowded BA milongas, and then giving us a handful of new moves and ways to combine them. Gerry's native English was very helpful at times for explaining some of the finer points, and having both Gerry and Lucia there meant that we were fully engaged with learning the whole time.After our second lesson they encouraged us to go to a milonga. They even booked us a table which helped us to not chicken out. They also told us how to get to the Tango World Championships, which were on at the time, and where best to buy Tango shoes.Finally, they sent us photos of us during our lessons, and a video to remind us of everything we learned in our lessons.

We could not be happier with our choice. Lucia and Gerry were cool, relaxed, and great, great instructors. In just 4 lessons, we gained a whole new appreciation for Tango, and are totally into getting more lessons and dancing close to home. The prices were very reasonable as well ($110 for each 2 hr lesson for both couples). We will definitely plan to come back and take more lessons with Lucia and Gerry in the future and have recommended them to our friends."

Lucia and Gerry, the Argentine volcano and the Irish perfect gentleman have succeded in making us learn a few tango steps in only three hours, making it fun and easy and giving us confidence we can improve. We bought tango shoes and decided to pursue the dancing at home. The milonga they took us to had a very talented band, 100 times better than the professional shows and the people dancing in the milonga were sensual, dedicated and very absorbed. It was an experience not to be missed. The only downpart was that it was too short. If we would have lived in BA, we would have been in their studio every week. Don't miss out, it will improve your stay tenfold!

She warned me it might be a little difficult, and I thought I'd give it a solid try - as long as the instructor wasnt barking condescending orders at me in spanish. Enter Lucia and Gerry - and all our fears were put to rest. Was it a challenge - yes - but such a fun one that brought us closer than ever. And as for the instructors - we left there feeling as though we'd made friends. There are a lot of other instructors out there - and we saw a few of them at other parts of the city, sadly I wouldn't have stuck with it after one lesson if thats how my classes were being taught.With Gerry & Lucia, you have a Husband-Wife team who are genuinely wonderful people who love the Tango. Additionally your class is in a beautiful mirrored studio in an old Tango School. Vaulted ceilings and wide marble floors await you as you enter, and then each 1-1/2 hour class is set with beautiful classic tango music. We did museums, we did sight seeing, we went to Parillas and La Boca, none of it compared to the Sunday evening we spent at the Milonga with Gerry and Lucia after our group class. In the end we ended up taking 3 classes, 2 privates and 1 small group, saw a dynamite show at the milonga, and had the time of our lives doing it...all for under $120 !!!!! Sunday group classes and the milonga can be had for about $20-30 with a bottle of wine and some snacks... best deal in the city"

Not only will you learn a lot, Lucia and Gerry will introduce you to to the unique world of tango music and the Milonga and help give you the confidence to dance there. Now I'm back in London, all that's left is to plan the next trip to Argentina.."

Someone at work had recommended Gerry and Lucia and they were spot on.Both were extremely accommodating and friendly which helped a lot since one or two of us had two left feet. The building was old and really had a lovely authentic feel about it.If you are ever in that neck of the woods myself and four colleagues would definitely recommend a tango lesson with them both. The only drawback was when they danced together, it left you in awe as they glided across the room effortlessly and made you more than want to take up lessons on your return.Thanks Lucia and Gerry, you guys are the best! xx"

They can teach all the basics very well and they are themselves phenomenal dancers so any student that sticks around them will have room to grow. They explained techniques very well and then there was a Milonga afterwards to practice at when I felt I was good enough. I plan on going back and continuing classes with them. Watching professionals and getting their individual advice for how your body is and should be moving was key for my quick adaptation to the better way to be dancing. For example, posture is a very specific thing that often can be taken for granted, and they give good insight for development. Very satisfied."

I can't dance to save my life but like many I'm a big Strictly Come dancing fan and the Argentine tango is one of my favourites. Lucia and Gerry work absolutely perfectly together. They explain everything so you can understand it and they compliment each other perfectly. They never talk over each other and are such fun to be around. They made the whole experience so much fun and in the process they taught me how to dance. The group lessons and Milonga are also amazing so make sure you do those as well. The orchestra is one of the best I've seen and you will get to see Lucia and Gerry in action as well. Wonderfully kind people and I will miss them greatly. Five stars all round! X"

Our first stop was Buenos Aires and, in exchange for a trip to a football match, my husband agreed to tango classes. We booked 2 90-minute lessons and I am so pleased that we did as it was a really unique experience. My husband and I don't really dance together, ever (not even for our wedding), and so this was a daunting prospect for us. Lucia and Gerry, however, were incredibly patient in the face of our total incompetence and even managed to get a few moves out of us in our time with them. I would say that one lesson would not have been enough and, time allowing, we ideally would have preferred to fit more lessons in with them. If we ever manage to revisit it will be top of the 'to do' list. We also really appreciated their invitation to join them at a milonga and thought it was a highlight of our trip. The live musicians were incredible, the dancing amazing and it was a great opportunity to meet other people and share experiences. To top it all off, Lucia and Gerry sent us through a selection of photos so that we have a lovely reminder of our time with them. Our tango faces are terrible, I don't think we're about to set the dancing world alight but we'd sign up tomorrow given the chance."

Lucia and Gerry are very good, talented and patient teachers. Both, me and my friend were absolute beginners and these two managed to teach us in only 5 lessons a good start for Tango. Time flies when you have fun, so I was really sorry when my time with these two were over. I can absolutely recommend to take classes with Lucia and Gerry. Both balance and complete each other during the lesson which gives the student the most profit. With these two, you are not just one of many! And I think especially for couples learning with them is perfect, as you have all options for learning techniques that are possible.A big thanks again for the nice time x"

Lucia and Gerry provided a great intro to tango during a private, 1.5 hour class, and were very patient with our very uncoordinated dancing! We walked away with a much greater appreciation for tango since we now know how hard those steps really are, though experienced/professional dancers make it look so easy. I think it was also super helpful that they spoke English. While my comprehension of Spanish would have been decent enough to probably understand what our instructors were saying, we were having a little bit of Spanish fatigue by the end of our 2 1/2 week trip. All in all, we walked away from the end of the class still not feeling quite like we could repeat the steps without their coaching, but it was certainly a very fun intro and probably the best way to do it for extreme beginners and English-speakers. If we had more time in the city, I would have wanted to take a second class. One of the nice pluses of the class is that they take pictures for you on their camera and actually send them to you afterwards via email (and promptly)!"

I had grown up doing classical dance and dabbled in ballroom style Tango, but this Tango is more of the Milonga, street style Tango - so everything I knew from the past I had to throw out the window. I learned that Tango is an earthy and sultry dance and so your feet should be nailed to the floor - not up on your toes. This is why they had their work cut out for them because I went up on my toes each time. However, Gerry was very patient with me and with Lucia giving excellent instruction on best positions, hand movements (even the simplest hand movement can mean something) and feet positions and I felt comfortable advancing through all the dance moves they wanted to teach me. They are very calm yet passionate teachers who love what they do and this was a fantastic experience during my two weeks in BA. If you can manage more than one hour I recommend it as you learn so much more about this fabulous dance and appreciate how hard it is when you see the professionals making it look so easy. They also invited me, along with about 20 other students, to a Wednesday night Milonga with a great band. If you get the chance to do this with Gerry and Lucia, do it.

We spent a wonderful hour with them in their private studio, learning enough tango to hold our own . . . and they could not have been more pleasant, patient (!), and clear in their instruction.

During the lesson they took lots of photos of us and sent them to us as a memento of the day. They also invited us to a milonga which they go to. It was a great night and we even managed to show off some of our new dance moves. We visited Buenos Aires over New Year. We asked Gerry and Lucia for recommendations on what to do. In the end we decided to book a tango show they recommended, which they also helped us book. They provided us with lots of helpful tips for our visit. On arrival they even sent us an email welcoming us to Buenos Aires. They really made us feel at home and couldn\u2019t do enough for us."

They were hands-on (literally!), patient, and very passionate about their craft. My girlfriend picked it up immediately - she danced for many years - but even though I was slowing our progress, I never felt rushed or flustered. No prior experience necessary. It was such a unique thing to do - learning tango in a private studio in a Buenos Aires neighborhood - that you have to try it when visiting. They even made a reservation for an exclusive club for us that night! Great people and great experience!"

Lucia and Gerry were absolutely awesome!!! We attended a group lesson that had about 7 couples which is on the larger side of their classes. There were varying levels of expertise among the class, and Lucia and Gerry were quick to identify the beginners and separated us from the \"experts.\" They could then focus on the separate groups and provide a lesson that appealed to both groups. The have a passion for tango, and you can't help but get swept up by it. They are very patient and great teachers. I highly recommend that you contact them for at least a group lesson if not some private lessons."

Their teaching is clear, sensitive and they had enormous patience with two complete novices. Read the other reviews below, look at their scores and you can see that you're going to get a great experience.

Of course that it's not possible in 3 lessons to know tango, but you know enough to dance one song. I think this is marvelous!They also took us to a real milonga, where we saw the local people dancing and an excellent band - absolutely fantastic!It was one of the best experiences we had in Buenos Aires!"

            "review": "Highlight of the trip!. My finace, Alex, and I were traveling to Buenos Aires for vacation and he suggested we take some tango lessons. We are getting married in June and thought, what a great dance to lead into after our traditional \"first dance\". In advance, Alex contacted Gerry and Lucia to schedule two private 1.5 hour classes with a group class in between. Alex and I already had chosen the song, so when scheduling the classes, we also indicated we wanted to dance to the song in \"Scent of a Woman\" : Por una cabeza (Carlos Gardel / Alfredo Le Pera). Gerry and Lucia in advance of our lessons thought about the dance and what moves we could learn in a short period and be able to replicate. Gerry and Lucia were always very quick to respond and the scheduling was one of the easiest that we experienced in Buenos Aires. We felt that the prices were reasonable, especially when you consider the individual attention you are receiving. The group class is extremely affordable and a great chance to dance with other tourists and locals alike. At first we were both a little nervous that we would not be advanced enough to participate in the group class as we had only had one lesson prior. However, the other students were of varying levels and beginners were welcome. In by no means are we now experts, but the tutelage from Jerry and Lucia was top notch. It was great because not only did I work with my finace on learning the moves, but since both Gerry and Lucia taught us, we were able to also work 1:1 with the experts. We purposely had the same song repeat so that we could really feel comfortable with the music and a few specific dance moves. Not only were Gerry and Lucia great teachers but at the end of our last session, they videoed them and us doing our dance with our song. Throughout all of the private classes they took photos of us. Now we will have pictures of our memories! We plan to practice with the video so that we don't forget our steps. The only slight negative that I have is that while we were in Buenos Aires during their summer (December 26-Jan. 2nd), it was extremely hot. Since it was also vacation (new year), where Gerry and Lucia normally teach was closed and we practiced in an old house in San Telmo with no air conditioning. They did bring a fan, which was very helpful, and provided cold water. Like many houses we saw, the studio was in a house that at one time was owned by someone very wealthy. The moulding on the outside and in was absolutely beautiful, coupled with gorgeous the marble staircase. Unfortunately, it is now a hostel so besides the room where we practiced, it was in need of some tender loving care (TLC). Looking back though, being in this environment gave me a true view into the lives of argentineans and if anything, the heat was something we all overcame. Besides learning how to tango, Gerry and Lucia invited us see Argentineans dance the Marengo at a local bar/ club. The night started off with an incredible 11 piece orchestra with 4 accordionists! Honestly, it was one of the best musical performances I have seen. Gerry and Lucia had reserved 2 large tables for their students and friends. While the musicians played, people danced on the floor in the center of the room. The club was packed so luckily we grabbed two big beers before we stat down. We sat at the table for about an hour and we were both completely mesmerized by the skill of the people on the floor. We have Gerry and Lucia to thank for such a memorable experience and it was definitely one of the best things we did on the trip!! We hope to see you next time we are back in Buenos Aires."

From day one I felt at ease, at home and welcomed into their Tango world. Lucia and Gerry are very enthusiastic and patient, they give you a lot of attention, they really want you to succeed. I wasn't just looking to learn a set of steps, but really learn how to dance Tango. There approach is based on learning how to feel the music, dance naturally, and relax in order to improvise effortlessly, as opposed to just learning a set of routine steps. They are teaching you the essence of Tango, to be free and enjoy the dance.They both have a lot of experience and passion for Tango and are well immersed in the Bs As Tango scene. After some classes Gerry and Lucia took us to authentic Milongas where you can practice. It doesn't matter what level you are, they will help you improve. If you want to really learn Tango in an encouraging and warm environment I cannot recommend Lucia and Gerry's classes enough."

They have nearly 2 decades of teaching experience, they are immersed in the BA Tango culture and they both happen to be two of the sweetest people you'll ever meet.They offer both group lessons and one-on-one lessons. I recommend you do both. Their approach is very much based around how Tango is danced at the Milongas as opposed to how Tango is danced at Tango shows. Their focus is based around feeling the music as opposed to counting and robotically repeating steps. If you're new to the dance (as I was) they begin very basic and get you moving very simply. A big part of the dance is the relationship and collaboration between the two partners; one is a Lead and one is a Follow. Almost immediately they'll get you focused on your part in that relationship and how it's meant to feel. Both of them teach and advise on both the leading and following parts which is great because of their different perspectives. You'll definitely receive a lot of attention from them. I can't recommend their lessons enough. Even if you don't have any intention to continue on with the dance afterwards, it's worth it. It's all about moving to the music and that's how Gerry and Lucia and approach their teaching. Plus since they're immersed in the Tango community they can keep you up to date on the various Milongas happen in the city. They had the chance to go to two Milongas during our stay. It is such a great opportunity to see the beautiful dynamics of this amazing dance. I highly highly recommend Lucia and Gerry."

Both of them were patient and helpful in the lesson assisting our limited abilities to carry out basic steps. The lesson started at 9pm and at 10 we walked a few blocks with them both to the milonga. There was an excellent ten piece band playing that night and watching the dancers on the floor expressing their interpretation of the music as the band improvised was fascinating to both listen and watch, we even got out on the floor. Whatever your tango ability, Gerry and Lucia will work very hard to ensure you get the best possible experience and Gerry send us great photos by email the following day for us to remember a very special evening.

Bottom line first: if you are looking for tango instruction in English, Spanish or both, dance, do not walk, to Buenos Aires to study with Lucia and Gerry. We just completed 14 hours (7 private 2 hour lessons each day for a week) and have nothing but rave reviews to offer!My husband is 83 years old and has broken each hip at different times skiing. He and I LOVE to dance but we've had bad experiences with tango teaching. For example, we spent two weeks in Buenos Aires at the Esquela de Tango taking 2 or 3 lessons per day (or more) and learned only that we really wished we could dance tango! The instructors came and went with, in general, no particular interest in their beginning students, focusing on the more advanced ones and offering nothing more than rote instruction. Great food in BA, but no tango success on that trip.So we approached Lucia and Gerry warily, hoping that private lessons might do the trick. And it did! Gerry and Lucia were in the midst of changing locations for teaching but they went out of their way to make sure that we were not inconvenienced in the least by their situation, going so far as to meet us at our hotel to walk us each day to the new place, giving us some relaxed personal time with them.They are great teachers. Their commitment and enthusiasm, coupled with their gentle, non judgmental style of making everything right and then better (\"There is no such thing as being on the wrong foot if you are still standing and your partner is, too!\") and their lovely, articulate movement style are wonderful encouragers as you approach what could otherwise be a daunting and complicated dance.Even better, they have a very clear idea of what to include and what to exclude from the teaching rubric so that the basics are well articulated and accessible.Then, when we attended a milonga and watched amazing dancers, we realized that we had acquired, quickly, efficiently and painlessly, a basic vocabulary upon which to build a tango movement library. What a delight.I cannot recommend Lucia and Gerry highly enough. In fact, I would like to arrange for them to come to Santiago de Chile, where we live, to teach here. They are too good not to share!Tango? Buenos Aires? Lucia and Gerry!Rima E. Laibow, MD"

There is also a chance to take part in the milonga after and food and drink there too.

The tripadvisor reviews were very positive, and I was attracted to the idea of instructors who are invested in establishing a reputation, versus the very well-known venues that appear in the tourist guides and can coast on their legacy. The prices are great -- the group lessons are really a bargain, but we thought we'd benefit from the extra attention of a private lesson, which was also very reasonably priced. We were 15-20 minutes late due to poor planning, but Lucia and Gerry were very understanding. I thought the lesson would only last 45 minutes due to our late arrival, but after we left I realized they had instructed us for well over an hour. We both really enjoyed the class, even my husband, who was dubious at first. Their approach is not formulaic, but instead is to teach the feel and intuition of tango dancing. The goal of this approach is to prepare dancers for a traditional milonga, where the style is more improvised. By the end of the class I felt I could tango well enough with an experienced partner. Most importantly, Lucia and Gerry were kind but instructive teachers, and we had a great time."

They not only tought me the steps but they also made me believe I can be good in tango. The classes were always very relaxed but we didn't waste the time. Both Lucia and Gerry tried the steps with me and my partner so we exactly knew what we were supposed to be doing. I took classes with other teachers as well to compare and quickly I realised that in other places they wanted me to have fun but not to teach me much. With Lucia and Gerry it was different. Each class I left with the feeling that I learnt something new. The atmosphere was also great. Lucia and Gerry are very open people and you feel like being tought by your friends. Not to mention that they can speak English so it makes it easier to understand the whole idea. So if you don't want to waste your time/money on watching somebody else showing off but you really want to learn something, take a class with this wonderful couple...once you do...remember to relax;) - you will get the joke after the first class..."

The tango class was a private lesson from Gerry (an Irishman!) and Lucia (a fun Argentine beauty). It was in a milonga right in the center of town. The location was right around the corner from a busy intersection where we could easily get a taxi back to the hotel. It was a cute little place. Gerry and Lucia worked with us for an hour. They were very patient and we enjoyed the experience. They invited us to come back to the milonga the next evening for a group lesson and practice, and then a late exhibition. We did so. It was a lot of fun. About a dozen couples participated in the group lessons, Then it was open dance floor for a an hour or so and we just practiced (Drinking and snacking between sets). We did not feel uncomfortable at all and Lucia and Gerry walked around and continued to help people who were tying to learn. It was fun to watch the regulars when tey started coming in about 9P. But we danced too ans stil felt comfortable.The single guys were on one side and the single ladies on another, but us couples sat on either end. It was great! i would rrecommend Gerry and Lucia if you want a comfortable, safe, tango experience. You will not feel at all intimidated. It is more like being at the home of friends (or in this case, the milonga!) mThe prices is very reasonable, especially group night. Do it!"

The two were very flexible in terms of scheduleing the lession and have a real passion for the Tango which is contagious. Gerry is a native english speaker, so communication is no problem. We had a great time and plan on finding a local instructor in NYC to continue with the lessons. One point of feedback for them is that Gerry and Lucia often demonstrate a series of steps and then ask us to do it. I had a really hard itme replicating the steps just by watching them and found it easier when each of them paired up with me and my fiance to show us the steps individually before we tried it together."

Naturally, with us travelling to Buenos Aires, it only made sense to take a Tango lesson while in town. It should be noted that neither my wife nor I are experienced dancers and our experience in general is almost nil. That said, we are so happy that our first Tango experience was in the trusted hands of Lucia & Gerry. They were patient with both of us as we were learning our footwork and getting our rhythm. They broke down the steps into easy to understand movements that allowed us to build up our confidence and eventually execute the dance properly to the music. (This after making many mistakes that they continued to let us work through.) My wife and I look forward to continuing to take Tango lessons back in NYC and thanks to Lucia and Gerry we look forward to keeping them updated to our progress. We can't thank them enough!"

We enjoyed a very memorable 1 hour tango lesson with Lucia and Gerry in San Telmo on a Sunday evening while visiting Buenos Aires. What a perfect time -- we could walk through the San Telmo market on the way to the lesson, and for only AR20 pesos per person, it was such a steal. We were complete beginners to tango, and while there were other people in the class who were learning more complex steps, Lucia and Gerry were very helpful to adjust the level to beginner steps for us. Although ours was a group class, it might have also been called semi-private as there were only 6 people in the whole class, so we got plenty of individual attention to teach us along the way. The location (on Defensa in San Telmo) was also fun - it was some sort of African cultural center, so there was a lot of fun rhythmic drumming going on outside as the market was going on.We don't speak much Spanish but both Lucia and Gerry are fluent in English so there was no issue with the language.I've recommended this already to other friends who were in Buenos Aires as a great way to inexpensively experience the tango.

But Gerry had a charming way of not telling the truth--in a way that is really helpful! \"You're just used to things coming easily for you--learning to dance Tango takes TIME.While failing to convince me that other students improve as slowly (\"you're just average\") both Lucia and Gerry convinced me that if I stick to it I WILL eventually be, if not a great dancer, at least good enough to be able to go to any Milonga, not make a fool of myself--and just have fun.And I think I should say at this point that for people who are not natural dancers? Private lessons are best. I have taken lessons--both group an private with both Lucia and Gerry and both are equally patient. (I actually prefer Gerry--as he is Irish, so he communicates in English in a way Lucia, who is Argentine, can't quite manage.. And as Gerry has to dance the woman's part? It isn't clumsy as he and Lucia are about the same size.I am sure that before 2012 is out I'll be dancing at a reasonable level--thanks to Lucia and Gerry. They are pleasant people and good teachers. I recommend them"

I knew my wife really wanted to try a tango lesson. The tango shows you can buy tickes for are good and include a brief tango lesson, but that's with 30 other people! With Gerry and Lucia it's 1:1 private lesson with no one else around (so it doesn't matter if yo can't dance like me!). We opted for a 2 hour lesson, which was just the right time. G&L even surprised my wife with a bouquet of flowers, so generous of them. In the lesson itself, they were both so friendly and patient and really worked with us so we could learn the steps to a brief dance with a few neat swanky steps! Thanks to you both for making it a special surprise. Would recommend to anyone wanting some private tuition with a verh friendly and professional couple. Thanks you G&L! :-)"

I had been planning this trip all year as I wanted to immerse myself in an authentic tango experience and I was determined to achieve this. Gerry and Lucia were recommended to me by a few friends in Australia so I contacted them as soon as I arrived. I had only been tangoing for 18 months and I wanted to concentrate on technique so i booked 5 private lessons with Gerry and Lucia and 3 of them took place in my apartment in San Telmo.They really took me under their wing and I went to quite a few milongas with Lucia and the Tuesday night milongas they organised in Sam Telmo (actually this was my favorite milonga in a slightly shabby but atmospheric hall with really friendly people and live music). I even had a 'tango moment\" at the Nino Bien milonga which I will never forget! I know I was a bit of a challenge but Gerry and Lucia were so patient and kind and I learnt so much from them. They really made my trip so much more enjoyable and it gave me an introduction to the authentic tango experience I had been seeking. I can thoroughly recommend them as caring, experienced, authentic tango teachers who will help you experience the real Buenos Aires tango scene. I will be back!"

Although we were many G nad L managed to teach us all the basics and gave us the possibility to understand the basic logic of the tnago. It was an amazing experience! We got the chance to practive with some really experienced tango dance partners and the music was great. Even the vemue was perfect, cerating a perfect ambience for dancing tango. If you want to go to a milonga in Buenos Aires, I really recommend a tango class to be taken beforehand, since you'll be able to grasp at least a little bit of this fascinating dance."

We found Lucia & Gerry tango lessons on Tripadvisor and gave it a try. First we went for a Tuesday-night milonga, a 1 hour class with other people, mostly beginners as ourselves. Lucia and Gerry were so nice that we decided to take a 2-hour private lesson the day after and it was simply amazing. They are very patient and funny teachers; we also got a delicious expresso from the building manager while we were waiting for them! In any case I would definitely recommend their class to anybody."

We wanted to have some classes in BA but how to choose? There seemed to be hundreds of teachers advertising lessons in the various tango magazines and on line- the choice was overwhelming- and we wanted something authentic, not just a tourist experience. Lucia and Gerry were recommended by staff in VB shoes, San Telmo and turned out to be the best teachers we could have hoped for. Firstly, they are skilful and experienced dancers -- their dancing is a delight to watch, mesmerising, connected, deceptively simple ( they have the ability to make each step look as though there is plenty of time, no hurry ). Secondly they are excellent teachers. Adults can find it hard to adjust to being beginners again and trying to learn new sets of skills - Lucia and Gerry were very good at guiding, correcting, repeating, showing, trying another way of explaining if we couldn't grasp something, and all with genuine warmth, encouragement and humour. We learnt things about leading , following and connectedness that we'd never grasped before. We loved the venues that they taught in - we went to three different places, all in San Telmo - one was a very beautiful old private residence ( owned by a friend of theirs) with typically BA architecture, high ceilings, parquetry floors, ornate wrought iron stair case railings - it was a wonderful experience seeing the building, let alone having a dance lesson there. They also invited us to one of their group classes, held in a community hall / Arts centre, which was an experience of everyday BA, definitely not touristy. Finally , Lucia and Gerry are genuine and warm people, and talking to them is very interesting - Gerry is happy to tell about his journey from Ireland to eventually settling in BA with Lucia, and is an entertaining and intelligent raconteur. Talking with them you get a feel for what it might be like living in BA, and not just being a visitor / tourist . Gerry is clearly fluent in English, being Irish originally, and Lucia's English is quite good as well.Can't recommend them highly enough - great teachers, great dancers, felt we had a genuine tango experience and slice of life in BA.Happy dancing, Rolf and Iris."

I highly recommend Tango lessons with Lucia & Gerry in Buenos Aires, they are the finest teachers in the city, and the classes are definitely worth the price/fees paid! I visited Buenos Aires recently and was very keen to learn tango in the most authentic way, as it is danced socially (milonga style) The touristic tango shows were not was I was looking for and my classes with Lucia & Gerry really opened up the doors to the world of Tango in Buenos Aires! The classes were so warm and friendly, Lucia & Gerry have a great teaching style (it helps that classes are conducted in Spanish and English) and truly demonstrate to the students the ease and flow that is true to the sensual Argentine Tango! After the Sunday class, there was a demonstration by other students and I got to interact with the locals. Totally had a blast! I was so pleased, I also attended another class on Tuesday which was followed by an awesome milonga (Flor de Milonga) hosted by Lucia & Gerry. I thoroughly enjoyed the milonga sessions and watching everyone dance was great while I tried to put my lessons to use as well. They also feature an exhibition/performance by professional tango couples at their milongas, must attend!!"

This Milonga is very friendly and full of locals who just love to dance. Gerry and Lucia are such a lovely couple, they have a great way of explaining the dance and the techniques needed to really enjoy it. Often with lessons in BA, language can be a problem, but not with these guys, they speak both Spanish and English fluently. Our experience in some of the larger more well known studios was not so positive, yet here with Gerry and Lucia we felt totally comfortable and improved quickly. All in all I would recommend them to anyone with absolute confidence."

I don;t remember what the entrance fee was but it nothing near what the turistic shows ask and we had a blast! We had drinks, watched the locals dance, tried a bit ourselves, chatted with Jerry and in the end of the evening there was also a demonstration from the teachers, really great!

We took these classes as a couple and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. It is probably true that 60+ is late in the day to start, and in that sense, we fell on our feet in finding Lucia and Gerry. They are truly skilled teachers, great communicators and quickly became very good friends. What we particularly is their approach to the discipline of Tango. This is authentic and ignores the melodramatic posturing associated with the offerings in many of the \"tourist show\" venues. Despite the intense concentration required and the physical demands, the classes were also great fun and we left each session really looking forward to the next booking. For us, tango is a five year project and we can't wait to get back to Lucia and Gerry's studio in BA."

The show was really good, with tango dancing, folk music and dancing, and individual singers, all with a live band. The meal was average, a medium rare steak was medium well, appetizers were ok, desert decent, but not gourmet, and no one ever asked us how was food after it was delivered - as I was considering retuning the steak.

The Zombie condition accuired was well worth the experience of the Mandola artist who expertly played a concert on an eleven string mandoline type instrument but only smaller and not as deeply bow backed as the traditional mandolines are. His solo concert sounded like a whole orchestra and had me in it's spell from it's very first note. These two items are what made the show a five star experience for me. I just wish I knew who the artist was. All I know is that he has played for the Pope and there is no higher authority on mandolin type instraments than the Pope."

My husband and I had a table right next to the stage (small stage) and the food and free flowing wine was of excellent quality. How do they cook that beef? I should also mention that transfers from and back to the hotel were included. Why did I like it? The show was small and intimate with a small audience.

This time spent dancing with my 24 year old daughter was priceless. Our tour guide, Pablo, enjoyed dancing with her as well. Then we went downstairs and had a fantastic dinner. The fillet was divine! It melted in your mouth. Nothing could prepare you for the show. The dancers were phenomenal as well as the musicians. The whole setting is so intimate. The dancers are literally inches away from you. I have never seen a better show! It was extremely moving."

The tango is a mixture os single couple and group dance, very hight level and acrobatic. There were two singers, a male one and a woman who realy harminized. Beautiful voices. The gaucho art was very good too.The only thing I was disapointed was the DVD one could buy after the show. It shows a different show and the quality is not really good."

            "review": "Quality Show, Decent Food, Crazy driver! . The show: As far as tango shows in BsAs go, this is still a tourist trap, but with a more intimate setting. First of all- pay in cash! The rate is 50% cheaper for the whole package. We paid $150 USD cash per person. This includes transfer, pre-show wine tasting or tango class, and dinner, with transfer back to the hotel. We opted for the wine tasting which was very nice. Note: they try to sell you wine after the tasting. We purchased one and later found out all wine was included in the dinner.The dancers were fantastic as was the music. Half of the show is folkloric and beyond wonderful. The performers have a great sense of humor. The singers did a great job, but the \"Evita\" ending was a bit dramatic for my taste. The food: Dinner includes appetizer, entree and dessert. You have a selection of fish, meats, and chicken and must order all courses at once. The meat we ordered was very good but the portions were huge. None of us finished our meal. Service was good, included wine, water, beer and soda pop. The show begins after you have eaten. Also, the waiters come by and ask for tips again after the whole show is over. Crazy Driver: After the show was done, we walked outside to find a little bit of chaos. There were several vans ready to take patrons back to their hotels, but no clear direction as to which went where. We were told to board a bus across the street where we waited outside for a bit as there was no driver. When he arrived were were quickly loaded on and took off. He was driving rather recklessly and as he dropped off the first group said 'ya los tir\u00e9' to someone on a phone. Roughly translated it means ' i threw them out'. Shortly after, he basically threw a drunk man out of the bus about 3 blocks away from his hotel. To make matters worse, he refused to drop a group of people at their hotel claiming that they had boarded the wrong bus and it was their problem to get there. He basically yelled and threw them out as well. This happend with one more passenger before he deposited us 2 blocks away from our hotel. This was definitely not Gala Tango's fault, however the whole transfer process should be better organized.Overall would definitely recommend for the tango experience. It is a great 'VIP' option as other shows have a bigger audience. You will find better food in many other parts of the city."

This is perfect for having dinner and show with a bottle of wine included in the price (good wine, Argentinian harvest). The price includes the transportation from and back to the hotel, the dinner, the wine and the show. The show is great, it has a great band of Tango musicians with the bandoneon player from the old (and pure) school of traditional tango. The dancers are spectacular and the singers too. If you are into Tango and know the lyrics you have no other choice than singing with them. The service was courteous and attentive. The place is very upscale and very beautiful. Cons: Kind of pricey in Argentinian pesos.Tip: If you bring US dollars to the country, this place accepts payments in cash with huge discounts, of $80.00 per person. This is a general tip for Argentina. If you are traveling from the US, bring cash! I paid one in cash and the difference was enormous. I wished I have known this before."

If you want an authentic tango experience with great value, this is the place! Highly recommended!"

A crew of around 20 musicians, singers and tango dancers (plus a team of support and wait staff) explain the higher price of $135USD cash (also includes hotel transfer). The price is higher if paying by card.Because it's such a production, it all feels a bit cheesy and fake - so don't come here expecting an authentic tango experience. That said, the musicians and dancers are extremely talented and it was entertaining from start to finish.I particularly enjoyed the traditional 10-string mandolin-type musician - he was amazing to listen to.Included in the price is a tango lesson or wine tasting. We did the wine tasting - as Argentinian wine is excellent. The staff taking the tasting were friendly and knowledgeable about Argentinian wine.The dinner was much better than expected - delicious steaks and more wine than we could drink.A couple of things that were a shame - they offer a cocktail before dinner, and when you accept they tell you it is an extra $8US each. Later they offer more things like photos with the dancers or extra tango lessons (I assume also at an extra cost). Photos are not allowed with your own camera - so you are forced to use their photographer). I figure this rule is to ensure camera flashes aren't going off throughout the performance, which is fair enough. They were also a bit pushy about tips (we had tipped earlier, then later were approached by another staff member asking where our tip was).If you plan on seeing one of the large tango productions, I would still happily recommend Gala Tango."

Dinner service starts at 8:00 and we had a very good empanada, filet and dessert and decent Malbec (we were given a bottle for the two of us). It wasn't the best meal in Buenos Aires but for a dinner show, I was pleasantly surprised. The show starts around 10 and is comprised of 4 couples that do some group numbers and individual dance (to live music - loved the older gentleman on the bandoneon). Interspersed are some singers, a gaucho presentation and music to the what I believe was the charango (small andean guitar like instrument) - all excellent. The ending was probably the only disappointment as they did the Evita Peron \"Don't' Cry for Me Argentina\" finale. Too touristy and brings thoughts of Madonna but overall the we enjoyed the show and would recommend."

Our Buenos Aires travel agent/tour guide, Sandra Gutrejde, gave our two couples three options for a tango show; La Ventana, Gala and Cafe de los Angelitos. Unfortunately they each showed up in different TripAdvisor categories like \"activities', \"attractions\" and \"nightlife\" making it hard to compare. Given our desire for a reasonably priced, typical tango show with good food, we chose Gala Tango. I can't tell you what the other shows are like but I can tell you we were quite pleased with this venue. First of all, as advertised we were promptly picked up at our hotel by a courtesy van. Secondly, as we were told, it was quite small (in an intimate way). Thirdly, the food brought to us before the show was, in my estimation, excellent. Restaurant quality, not dinner show quality. And the wine never stopped being poured. Finally, the show was amazing. We had a variety of dancers, singers and a gaucho (Argentinian cowboy) doing a traditional dance. More entertaining than I had expected. When we first booked this event I thought this would be a high priced demonstration accompanied by mediocre food. I am happy to say it was an wonderful demonstration of tango accompanied by excellent food in an intimate setting."

After checking out a dozen or so options , Trip advisor and getting some input from our tour guide and our hotel , we chose for the Dinner/ Tango show of Gala Tango . What a great choice ! The evening began being picked up from our hotel (included) , once at the location for the show we were very pleasantly received by our hosts and graciously shown to our table for the evening . We were very pleased that we were seated centre stage at the second table from the stage. ( Because the intimate size of the classy 1930's decorated room I don't think there are many bad seats in the house ) Shortly after a pleasant server showed and explained us the menu and offered the wine which he kept flowing all night long . The meal was great very tasty and the Filet perfectly done . Everything was nicely presented with class as if we were in an exclusive fine dining restaurant .Around 10 pm after we had a chance to be photographed with a tango dancer the show began . The small orchestra sounded fantastic and the tango music filled the room at perfect volume.The show has about 10 dancers 4 singers a fantastic special a guest musician and a goucho dancer . Once the show started the numbers followed one after another without any long talks or speeches , the atmosphere was just fantastic . Also during the show the wait staff kept the glasses filled with a very fine wine . ( their own label ) . The show lasted for almost 2 hours and as far as we were concerned they could have kept on going all night . What an evening and what an experience . Now we knew for sure we were in Argentina ! and we will remember this perfect night for a very long time . Sure it cost a few dollars , make sure when you order this to pay in cash on the night in US dollars , it was worth very penny ! In closing we were shuttled back to our hotel . If you also are looking for a fantastic Tango show I can recommend GALA TANGO without any hesitation !"

After spending the past 19 days on a cruise ship and seeing a number of great shows on board, I wasn't expecting this to be anywhere near the same quality. Boy, was I wrong! To be honest, I'd have to rate our visit to GALA TANGO as the high point of the entire vacation. (Sorry, cruise ship performers.)After spending many hours investigating possibilities for a tango show in Buenos Aires, I selected this one primarily on other reviews here on TA. Once again, I'm proud to say, TA members have been \"right on\" with their reviews and opinions. We booked this tango performance several weeks prior to embarking on our cruise (which ended in Buenos Aires) so we didn't have to frantically try to find one once we were in the city.The actual performance we attended was on the evening of Feb. 19. The cost of the entire event was US$165 PP which, at the time, seemed to be a little expensive. However, as the night progressed, I realized we got exceptional value for the cost...especially considering that it was truly an \"all-inclusive\" evening.The price of the evening included the following: (a.) Transportation from your BA hotel, no matter where it was located in the city, (b.) an exceptional (2 hr.) meal with a good selection of entrees including all drinks (yes, wine, too.), (c.) a SENSATIONAL tango and folk dance performance by approx. 16-18 multi-talented dancers, singers and musicians, (d.) top notch table service and attention by the wait staff, (e.) a small, intimately beautiful dinner theater setting, and (f.) a return ride back to your hotel. Total time from pick-up to drop-off was approx. 5 hrs.I would love to describe the whole evening in every detail but, to do it justice, it would take another 1000 words or so. Therefore, let me just fully recommend that, should you wish to enjoy/experience a \"real\" tango show while in BA, quickly book a performance at the GALA TANGO. You have my assurance that you, too, will place it as a top remembrance of your visit to Argentina!"

Location was in older area of BA so we appreciated the transportation to and return from our hotel. Food was fabulous, steaks were great and the best we had in Argentina.. Ordered the filet and husband got steak like a rib eye. Included wine was great. Venue is small and we were third from the stage.

We arrived a little early and were not allowed in the venue, so we waited outside. We were the first ones in and seated at the dining table. The tables were arranged so the table is perpendicular to the stage, so you are looking over the person next to you to see the stage. Not the best experience but you can move the chairs a little after the show starts. This was an amazing show, the dancers were great and they had a great musical act at the end. The space was fairly small, it got very dark and hard to see what you were eating after the show started. The food was ok. Not spectacular. They have a point in the show where you can come up and learn tango. No one in our audience wanted to do it. Then they also let you come up and get photos taken - they have a photographer there that you can purchase the photos from. We were in a big group and told we could not take photos. (For any part once the show started, and it was very dark and hard to do anyway.) I had a nice camera and they rushed us so quickly during the photo op, in fear we would take our own photo, that I was not even smiling in the photo/looking at the camera. Bummer, because it could have been a cool trip memory but the photo was so terrible that we didn't buy it. Their loss. Overall, I felt it could have been a better experience if the food was of better quality (they have to produce in mass to serve everyone at the same time) and if the staff were friendlier and more accommodating to their guests wishes."

Perhaps drawn out a bit long when they brought out the gauchos and the Andes pipe players, but some may not have seen these previously.The meal was much better than average, with a thick, perfectly cooked steak being one of the best ever, accompanied by a nice local red wine included.Best if you can get a seat fairly near the front, but not immediately by the stage (which will be marked by a curtain when you arrive).

My Husband and I both really enjoyed the Show and the dinner was excellent (as was the Wine). It was our first Tango Show so we really don't have anything to compare it to but the Show had variety, the dancing was wonderful and we really enjoyed it. The Dancers were awesome and loved it when they sang \"Don't Cry for me Argentina\". We really enjoyed the smaller venue and the atmosphere was elegant and classy. I ordered the Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer and it was by far one of the best that I have ever eaten. My Husband ordered the Filet and I went with the Argentinian Beef. The steaks were tender and very flavorful! They were very generous with the Wine and service was very good!The only negative and we can't fault the Venue for this is with regards to the pick up/drop off. That was a disaster. We waited almost one hour past the time they said to be ready and had to have our Concierge call several times as to where are they. They actually came and picked up two Ladies at our hotel but left without us as they thought they were only picking up two even though we were standing outside of the hotel. They then had to come back to our hotel to get us after the last call by our Concierge. At the end of the Show the transportation was not there and we took a cab back with the Ladies. I would recommend taking your own cab there and back and not getting involved with the transportation shuttle.I highly recommend Gala!"

Both medium rare and cooked to perfection. We finished with chilled marinated pear w/ ice cream. The waiters were absolutely amazing, great service, and very handsome. We did not expect the food nor the service to be at this level and were greatly surprised. We had some wonderful people sitting beside of us that we're all about to go on a cruise. You know we had lovely conversation about cruising and cruise ships. The entertainment was beyond what we expected. The orchestra consist of two violinist a double bass, accordionist, and the musical director was playing the piano. The dancers were absolutely gorgeous, amazingly talented and you can tell they were trained very well. The show also included a couple of specialty acts which included a couple of singers and 1 dancer las pampas; a folklorist dancer that performs a combination of flamenco with with apparatus and a big drum. And then this amazing guitar player playing an instrument I had never seen before. It was like a large ukulele with multiple strings, maybe eight strings. Again all of the entertainers were extremely talented and the audience showed their appreciation after each performance. I would highly recommend this show as an evening event for anybody looking for a full evening of entertainment."

Considering we had paid $135 each we then said we would stick with the included wine. Consequently we then found ourselves presented with a jug of tap water and left to study the menu. The waiter came back 30 minutes later and took our food order but still nothing else materialized. Eventually we mentioned this to the passing manager and in fairness we were well catered for from that point onwards. We had a great evening but they need to be careful not to spoil the experience in such a minor detail."

My bride though not insistent was keen to see some tango dancing and rather than go to a club after dinner (my have needed to wait till 11 or 12) we decided to go to a tango show.Gala Tango was recommended as being intimate with excellent food. The cost was 200USD but 135USD if paid in cash for a 3 course meal and supposed \"open bar\" - we took the latter option.On arrival you are ushered into an impressive room that seats around 100 people. Having been offered a pre-dinner cocktail and a list of suggestions you are then informed there is an extra charge for these drinks - sorry Gala - very very poor form. The choice of meals was reasonable my Chicken Caesar salad quite nice but my rare Fillet Mignon (excellent choice according to our waiter) though huge was watery with gristle and sinew throughout - average to poor!The house wines I tried - a Mendoza Chardonnay and Malbec were more than acceptable - though none were served understandably during the show.The show itself was very entertaining and such intimate surrounds I don't believe there would have been a bad seat in the house. A mixture of tango dancing by 4 youthful and enthusiastic couples was interspersed with songs, drums and a style of male flamingo! The highlight for me was an electrifying performance by a male performer playing a local strained instrument that looked like a cross between a 10 stringed mandolin and a eukelele - quite outstanding. The finale was somewhat jingoistic and overblown but seemed to appeal to the majority of the demographic.Overall a worthwhile experience - if these types of shows are your \"thing\""

The service was very friendly and efficient. The venue is the perfect size. Every seat is good as far as I could tell. The pictures on their website a representative of the room. We had seats right in front of the stage, so that was great. We had a few minutes of tango steps before hand with some of the dancers (you get your picture taken with them and the guy comes around during dinner for US$10 - good picture) The tango was great fun and very well executed. One of the real highlights of the show was the goucho player and the goucho dancer with the bolero. Really well done. It finishes off with Evita at the end which was nicely sung. There was about a fifteen minute wait to get back on the bus to the hotel. The only snag in the evening. Hot tip: bring US dollars instead of paying by credit card. Much different price - 140 instead of 200 (true of everything in BA)."

And with triply high prices on Christmas Eve, the Gala chef is certifiably psychotic. On the other hand, Gala offers an intimate venue with excellent service and, above all, a first rate show.

However, when we arrived at our hotel, we asked them to recommend one and book it for us. I had seen reviews for Gala so when they suggested it, we asked them to book it. They said it would be $200 per person for the show, meal and unlimited drinks and the bus would be there at 8:00.The bus arrived at 7:30 so we rushed to get ready. I think this was a miscommuncation issue with the hotel and not an issue with the company. We had to go by several other hotels before we made our way to the venue which was already pretty full.We sat almost at the end of the table (farthest from the stage). At first I thought this would be disappointing but it was fine. Sort of a plus because we were closer to the wine which was only one seat away from us.The show is a mixture of tango, singing, gaucho and instrumental. There were pretty long periods of time where there was no dancing at all. If you are looking for straight up tango, non stop for several hours, this is not the show for you. However, the dancing, when we did see it, was pretty amazing. One of the most impressive performers is the accordian player who is probably 85. He killed it!Before the show you can get on stage for a quick 5 minute lesson and learn eight steps. Sort of a fun thing to do for those interested.The food was average but we didn't expect much after reading the reviews. The beef carpacio appetizer was probably the most successful plate on the table that evening. The wine was tasty and we got an entire bottle of sparkling malbec rose to ourselves which was delicious.BIG TIP - We had not pre-paid for the show and dinner and were expecting to pay $200/person. When it came time to settle the bill, we offered American dollars and only paid $130/person! This was a HUGE savings so I would recommend not booking and paying in advance."

After seeing many tango shows I saw Gala Tango together with several of my colleagues, every year we have a critical look at several shows in order to select only the best ones to add on to our offerings at Class Adventure Travel. From the service, the dances, the singers to the ambiance everything has been given thought and is just perfect! This is one of the few tango shows with an excellent dinner, which includes traditional options such as, Argentine empanadas and excellent meat options. There are as well several gourmet dishes on the menu such as a salmon Carpaccio. Wines accompanied the food perfectly and service was very good. The show started while we were finishing our deserts. Dancers are very talented and gave a very good performance, so did the singers and the orchestra. I also shouldn\u2019t forget to mention the folklore assists, which are amazing! This show has without any doubts the best folklore musicians in house! One of the unique elements of the show is the small venue, the view to the low stage is perfect from all tables. I\u2019d recommend Gala Tango to everyone who is looking for a unique tango experience!"

This place gained great notoriety after Madonna and here boy toy were caught leaving here back in December of 2012. The price is on par with the other high end tango shows here in Buenos Aires. As usual we skipped the meal and only went for the show.Beautiful stage but the performers and the wait staff have to use the aisle behind the tables. I found this to be distracting.Dancing was very good but there wasn't an \"MC\" so to speak so the show felt a big disjointed, unlike other tango shows.The music and the folkloric part of the show...identical to other shows.The orchestra was decent but I like to see more than one bandeleon in a tango orchestra.If you want an entertaining show, I would suggest it but there are other tanguer\u00eeas that have a better seating arrangement and a better orchestra."

While the price was a little steep, I'd have to agree. The stage is low and the tables go right up to it. It is a fairly small venue so you are sure to get a good seat. I believe a bottle of wine came included in the dinner. The food was alright. Certainly not the best you can get in the city by any means but you are really there for the show. The show was fantastic! I loved the music and the dancing. The band is playing on stage right behind the dancers. I didn't pick up most of the dialogue/lyrics to some of the songs as everything is in Spanish but trust me, that won't detract from the experience. If you have a free early evening, I'd highly recommend Gala Tango"

The venue is gorgeous, service was five-star all the way, food and drink were excellent, and the show itself was unforgettable. I don't see how you could go wrong with this choice, especially since the venue is intimate enough that everyone has a great seat. I was really blown away by the show, though - the tango was of course amazing, and the dancers were so talented. But I hadn't expected there to be other aspects of the show too. The 'gaucho' dancer who performed with the bolos and the guy who played the \"charango\" (?) were UN-believable. Truly some of the most exciting performances I've ever seen. And the band playing live music was great too - the accordion player is worth the price of admission all by himself. Speaking of, the price of admission is steep, but for a once in a lifetime experience (plus a great meal), we felt it was totally worth it. I HIGHLY recommend Gala for a memorable night!"

The theater, service and show could not have been better! The show was much more than tango dancers. It was approximately 1 1/2 hours long, with a 5 piece band, singers, Goucho dancer, 4 outstanding couples dancing the tango, and a wonderful entertainer playing the \"charango\", a small guitar like instrument that he played with gusto. The price includes a welcome champaign cocktail, a full bottle of Argentine wine, another glass of champaign at the end of the evening, and even a short tango leason on stage with one of the dance couples. We had a fantastic time! It is well worth the price of admittance."

The venue sent a van to the hotel to pick me up and the driver was very friendly. Even though he didn't speak English and my Spanish is \"muy malo\", we seemed to communicate with no problem.When I got to the venue I was so pleasantly surprised at the interior. The setting was small, but very elegant with beautiful decorating and beautifully laid out tables. There isn't a bad seat in the house to see the show. The wait staff is very attentive and really friendly. Oswald was our \"head waiter\" and he could not have been nicer.Once the show started, it was the perfect mix of showmanship and drama!! The singers take their roles very seriously. While it is very beautiful and moving, just the right amount of wine and fatigue can also bring out a little bit of camp with how dramatic the female singer performs. Nevertheless, it added to the authenticity of the show.Dinner and the show was about $160 USD per person including transportation, bottomless wine, really good food and a fantastic show. For me it was well worth it."

I dined with people from other countries who had been to other tango shows that they said were too ballet-ish or otherwise didn't have any zest. The show at Gala was not disappointing at all - super passionate live music and tremendously talented young dancers. There are two men with \"intermission\" sort of routines that are very entertaining. There are also a couple of singers, although I did not enjoy as much as the rest of the program. The food was phenomenal - I think probablyl the best meal I had during my trip to BA. The wait staff was \"disappointed\" that I could not finish the steak, and really, I wish I could have... but it was just too much food. Delicious. The wine flowed endlessly. I highly recommend this show, in the heart of San Telmo."

We booked this through BsAs4U, the cost was 150 US dollars each, the same cost as booking it direct with the tango house, but they provided transport and were very helpful with the booking, they also called the hotel the night before to reconfirm our pick up time. What I liked about this place was that it was small, so whereever you sat you had a great view, we were lucky and were seated right at the front. As far as I am aware there is no VIP seating as we did enquire and were told the tickets were all the same cost. We went for dinner and it was lovely, you have a choice of starter, main & dessert, you get a bucks fizz on arrival and unlimited wine throughout the night and a glass of champagne at the end. You also get the chance before the show to have a quick lesson. The show is excellent, a traditional tango show and it incudes 2 speciaIity acts. I have two criticisms, the first being once the show started it was difficult to locate our waiter to get our wine topped up and the second is that whilst the show was going on they tried to sell us a photo, but if they had waited until the end I may have bought it. Once the show finishes if you have transport you leave quite quickly, it would have been nicer to stay a while. Overall I would definatley recommend this for the show, venue & quality of food and drink."

In search of a more traditional, authenic and intimate tango experience than the larger tango halls, I elected to try Gala Tango. The elaborate chandeliers, ornate ceiling and classic furnishings immediately met my expectations of a traditional tango experience.Although I only elected to go to the tango show and not the dinner, the couple on the table next to me said that the food had been a better standard than many of the other tango houses. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and welcoming; leading us to our table and producing a welcome drink as well as keeping our glasses topped up throughout the evening. The show lasts approximately 2hrs and consists of four dancing couples, two singers and a live tango orchestra, plus an Argentine folkloric performance with a Charango (small guitar) and an impressive gaucho show using bolas (hunting tools) to create a rhythm and music. The intimate stage creates a personal tango experience allowing you to follow and pay attention to the dancers footwork.The only downside of the show were the singers whos voices had probably deteriorated throughout the years. A rendition of ''Don't Cry For Me Argentina'' at the end of the show was slightly cringe-worthy however, their rustic, slightly off-key voices added to the traditional, authentic ambience.You can book Gala Tango through their own website, through your accommodation (although many hotels are linked to particular tango houses) or as I did, through a local travel agency (www.bsas4u.com). Overall, the show was extremely enjoyable and met all my expectations for a traditonal and authentic tango experience in San Telmo."

We liked the ambiance with cute decor and soft jazz music playing in the background. Veronica and Manuel were both very friendly, kind, and welcoming. The class included the four of us and two others. It is clear that Veronica and Manuel are experienced in running their cooking class, as they were both very professional and were able to describe their cooking methods with ease. Both Veronica and Manuel spoke very good English. Manuel did a great job explaining the reasoning behind his cooking techniques and answering any questions we had. Veronica was well versed in describing the wine pairings and discussing the different regions of Argentina as related to the food we were cooking and the wine we were tasting. We appreciated their flexibility in their menu, as one of our group members is a vegetarian and another is allergic to alcohol. They provided us with two types of vegetarian empanadas (cheese and onion, and broccoli with cream). They also provided us with fresh fruit juice pairings as a substitute to the wine pairings. We also liked that the class was very \"hands on\" and we liked creating and rolling the empanadas dough and stuffing our empanadas. Veronica and Manuel are both passionate about what they do and it is evident in the way they teach their class. After the class, we were sent an email with the recipes. Aside from the cooking demonstration and class, the food was incredibly delicious. The empanadas we made were by far the best we had in Argentina, and the flan and dulce de leche were amazing as well.As Americans, we would recommend that you do not arrive to the class hungry. Argentinians tend to eat later than we do in America, so although the class was scheduled for 6pm to 9pm, we started a bit late as the other two guests arrived late and did not eat until 8:30 or 8:45pm. All of us enjoyed the cooking demonstration, but we were also starving. We left around 9:30pm.We would recommend this class to anyone who loves food and/or cooking. We really enjoyed our experience and will definitely return if we are ever back in Buenos Aires."

It was great to be in their apartment and, especially to experience their warmth and humour as well as preparing and eating good food and drinking some very good wines. Thanks Veronica for introducing us to \"Torrentes\", the only truly unique Argentinian wine. Being a group activity it was also a nice opportunity to meet other like minded people. We could not recommend this experience enough. Frank & Gillian Swanberg, Auckland, New Zealand."

Friendly way to enjoy argentinian food, wine and culture!We've been in Tierra Negra for cooking in 2016 and really had a great time. The class took place at Emanuel and Veronica home. The place is really charming and Emanuel and Veronica hosted the 6 guests from diferent countries. We've learnt how to prepare empanada dough and filling (meat and cheese fillings) and all tricks on how to knead, open, fill and seal close the empanada dough. We have also learnt how to prepare \"dulce de leche\" and \"dulce de leche\" flan. The class takes about 3 hours of leisure time, with good wine and explanations about the several argentinian regions and its distinct habits and culture. Really great experience!"

The food was delicious - definitely the best empanadas we've had during our entire time in South America - and the wine selections were spot on but also quite varied to give a good overview of Argentinian wines. Vero and Manu were both also so friendly and we had a great time talking about all that Argentina has to offer - we can't wait to come back again and would highly recommend this class if you find yourself in BA!"

Extremely clean and well organized. They pre-measure everything so that you can visualize what your are doing and remember what you have done. You are able to learn a lot of cooking and appreciate a lot of eating, in the very efficient short time. It was all effortless. Manuel has deep culinary knowledge. He conveys cooking techniques, and a through understanding of ingredients and the cultural origins of the food we/they are preparing. Veronica really conveyed the origin and many varieties of all Argentinian wine including the 4 very well chosen local wines that were served with the class. Their english is outstanding. They gave us restaurant recommendations in Buenos Aires, shopping suggestions, researched where we could locate spices and good Argentinian cutlery; travel advice, shopping and restaurant recommendations for our trip to Bariloche. You couldn't get a better experience than this if you had cousins in Buenos Aires. It would be the first thing i would do if coming to Buenos Aires...especially for the first time."

Manu is an excellent chef and Veronica a great host and sommelier. You're invited into their amazing loft home where they have set up a homey cooking studio. Manu does a great job explaining what to do, so you end up with these fantastic 'finger foods' (in between quotes, because it's so much more than just finger food). While preparing the food, Veronica lets you taste a great cocktail and some beautiful wines. Both of them share a lot of background about Argentinian (food)culture as well, which makes this a cultural experience as well. Plus, they're just very nice people to spend some time with.

After that we went back and prepared a delicious 4-course-menu - with wine pairing of course. For example the main course was home made gnocchi with lamp meat which was really great. I will definitely prepare this dish again at home. Veronica and Manuel are so nice people. They tought us a lot about food, especially about Argentinian food and traditions. And they answered all our questions about country and people. This was maybe the best thing about the course: to have the opportunity to talk - like with friends - with Argentinian locals for several ours and learn so much about the culture of the country.

Since it is the slow season in Buenos Aires, we ended up being the only 2 students for the night! We started out learning how to make 2 kinds of dough from Manuel- one for bread and one for empanadas. As we were working on our dough, Veronica gave us a cocktail to start the evening. We went on to make salsa criolla and chimichurri, before putting the empanadas together (and learning several folding techniques)! We then went on to make andean potatoes, a gaucho sandwich, and choripan. The class was about half participation, half demonstration, but Manuel walked us through each step to make sure we would be confident recreating the dishes at home, all while sipping on the cocktails and wines Veronica gave us (with explanation of the origin). We thoroughly enjoyed the conversation throughout the evening, and were able to ask our hosts questions about the Argentinian culture and Buenos Aires. When the food was ready to eat, Veronica and Manuel went into the kitchen and gave us a little privacy to enjoy our meal. The food was amazing (our favorites were the empanadas and choripan) and we stuffed ourselves. We were not able to finish everything, so Manuel gave us a to go container with our leftovers (which we finished after going to the bar that night). After the class, Veronica and Manuel emailed us the recipes from the class, and also recommendations of their favorite spots in Buenos Aires. Our night with Tierra Negra was one of the highlights from our trip to Buenos Aires! It was such a unique experience that we will treasure for years to come (especially when we make the recipes we learned).Thank you Tierra Negra Cooking!"

I'm not the greatest at cooking but they were patient and amazing. They changed the menu for preparation on our request. They were lovely people and also offered us small canap\u00e9s with matching wines throughout the night. We make beautiful Empanadas and Alfajores which they made seem really easy. I would 100% recommend these guys. After our class we all went down and got a beer from their local bar too. A great and memorable night in Buenos Airies :-)"

Veronica and Manuel suggested I do the empanadas class instead and I am so glad I did,Veronica and Manuel made everyone feel warmly welcome and gave us many great culinary as well as cultural tips about their fabulous city. This was my final night after 2 weeks in Buenos Aires and I was so happy to be able to spend it enjoying great food, great wine and great company.This is more a demonstration than actual hands on class. The ingredients are prepared, ready for us to make our own dough. Manuel demonstrates the filling for the empanadas, kindly omitting the olives from my share. Shaping the empanadas is much more difficult than it looks, a skill to be practised.Manuel demonstrates how to make the flan and dulce de leche, which reminded me very much of my mum's caramel sauce.Veronica takes our tastebuds on a tour of 3 wine regions, pairing them with cheese, the empanadas and the flan and dulce de leche.The next day we were sent recipes, so that we can hopefully reproduce everything back home. They also sent me a list of restaurants to try, but unfortunately time got the better of me and I was unable to get to them. Next time!"

First Veronica took us to an adorable farmers market to buy ingredients for our class, she explained the foods that were sold there and took us into to garden to show us the veggies that were grown there. Then back to their apartment where Manuel showed us how to cook a DELICIOUS meal. He was a great teacher and explained the ins and outs of the processes and why and how it works. The Argentinian gin was amazing!! I don't like gin usually but this was divine!! I need to find where to buy it in Australia! Veronica and Manuel are great, fun people and will be back to do another class when next in Buenos Aries. Thanks again!!"

The wine pours weren't just tasting pours (and the glasses got filled up when they were empty!) We left with full stomachs, a ton of knowledge about local food, more recommendations for local restaurants and culinary trips than we have time for (sadly).

Totally worth it, a highlight of my stay, and I'd love to come back for more the next time I'm in BsAs! Veronica and Manuel are such great people: helpful, welcoming, friendly yet professional, flexible, knowledgeable -- I just love them! I've now taken four cooking classes in three different countries, and this one is truly set apart by the teacher/hosts. I hope our paths cross again soon! Below I'll describe the two classes I took, in case anyone wants more detail/insight.Class #1) Manuel and Veronica arranged a special class for us since my husband and I were travelling with our 5 year-old. We made empanadas (beef and caprese), flan, and dulce de leche. The adults enjoyed 3 lovely wines and Veronica blended lovely organic juices for my son. I admit, the class was a *little* bit less hands-on than I thought it would be, but the info and demos from Manuel were great. If you're interested in a more hands-on experience, just ask! I'm sure he'll invite you up to his station at the head of the table to do some steps with him. Our favorite part was working/kneading/rolling the empanada dough, filling it, and folding it. They even had a child-sized apron ready to go for my little one. When he needed a break, he just hung out on their couch and played a few games on our tablet, then came back to help us egg-wash the empanadas. We had a bunch of empanadas left even after we ate our fill, so Veronica packed them up to go, along with small jars of dulce de leche for us to take home. Class #2) On the day of the 2nd class, I left my little one to explore the zoo with his dad. Three friends and I had a relaxed and sugar-filled morning making chipa (gluten free cheese rolls, similar to Brazilian pao de queijo), alfajores, and pasta frola (quince pie). We made a ton, so we had lots to take away for snacks over the next couple of days. This class was more interactive, which I appreciated. We made 3 different doughs, all from scratch and with a lot of mixing with our hands. At the end, Veronica gave us a lesson in mate preparation, and we had a nice midday snack of mate plus the treats we'd baked."

Due to our tight travel schedule we were unable to make the group class and Veronica and Manual were flexible and kind enough to have us for a private cooking class. Manuel is a true chef with prior experience at restaurants and therefore we learned so much more than just how to make empanadas. We learned cooking technicalities and the science behind it all which made the cooking class all that much better. I highly recommend taking a cooking class with them. To add to it all they are also wonderful hosts!"

His directions as to what to do were also accompanied with explanations of why - that I even understood. He welcomed questions at any time and engaged us in discussion to ensure we understood the responses. Before long, I was nodding my head up and down and just itching to get started. He is an engaging teaching chef. Then enter Veronica with tasty hors d'oeures and just the right wines from Argentina as we were preparing the food. They made a great team and both made us feel relaxed. They were personable and delightful. It was a very, very enjoyable time. Now for the food. We made empanadas, dulce de leche, and flan.

I don't normally go for flan but I'll definitely be trying this recipe at home and trying to recreate the dulce de leche if possible. For the empanadas we made the dough and then both beef and veggie filling. Manuel was very informative about the process, the ingredients, and open to sharing all his culinary knowledge. Veronica poured generous servings of three different wines throughout the course of the evening as well as two little nibbles before we got into the empanadas. It was all delicious and well worth the price! Highly recommended, it will be a top memory from my time in BA.

Manuel and Veronica are fantastic hosts whether there are 8 people or just 2. They are attentive and answer any questions on food, cooking or Argentinian history, culture and living. The empanadas Manuel planned for the first class were superb and with the recipe we got in an email and the \"training\" we got during the class we were able to recreate the taste for our New Year's Eve party. The menu created by Manuel for the second class was imaginative but still rooted in the Argentinian culture and the trip to the local organic market with Veronica to get ingredients was an experience on its own. Manuel's explanations were detailed and interesting with a scientific-bent - he should have his own YouTube channel :) While Manuel took care of the food-side of the class, Veronica gave a mini-lecture on Argentinian wines and we got to taste some of them during the first evening as well. These were great and in fact prompted us to change our trip itinerary and we ended up spending a day in Cafayate to taste some Torrontes wines (Cafayate turned out to be lovely small town with some great wines and amazing scenery - highly recommended). Overall, both classes were great and I think this is a fantastic experience and superb way of meeting new people and making friends, learning how to cook, trying out new recipes and getting to know other cultures.

The class was hosted in the couples home and provided a glimpse into real Buenos Aires life (unique from the other events we had organized). M&V accommodated our special vegetarian empanada request with grace and even provided additional flavors - everyone was jealous of the vegetarian fillings. M&V knew their audience well and were very generous with wine tastings. I had some of the best Argentinean white wine (Torrontes) I've ever tasted in this class. Their sweet dog came out at the very end to meet us and nibble on some leftover empanadas :)Only suggestion is making the recipes easier to follow in terms of cups/tbs/etc. The measurements in grams was a little technical for our audience and I have yet to replicate the recipes at home as a result.

Then Manuel started making the filling both meat and vegetarian while explaining the steps. After it was complete we were given the filling to fill our shells. While the empanadas were cooking, we did some wine tasting and socializing. Then we ate the empanadas we made.We really enjoyed the experience, but would have liked to do more hands on cooking like we've done in other classes."

We had wanted to find a wonderful yet affordable cooking class while in Buenos Aires, and luckily an old friend recommended this one \u2013 we were able to book the week-of and took a Friday morning postre (dessert) making class. It was marvelous! Veronica and Manuel were such gracious hosts and teachers. The class is right inside their adorable home in the posh neighborhood of Palermo, and one other couple sat opposite the table from us, so a lot of personal attention. There was time for cooking and personal storytelling as well. Also, they explain the origins of the ingredients and provide the recipes after the class. It was a relaxing and fun way to start a morning, and we can\u2019t wait to recreate the desserts for our friends back home. We cooked much more than we could eat, and they packed up the leftovers for us to hold onto and snack on the rest of the day. For English speakers looking for a really lovely Argentinean cooking class at a reasonable price, this is the way to go!"

I have to admit, I have never been a big fan of empenadas or flan, but Manuel makes such wonderful versions of these traditional dishes, that I loved them both! I will definitely cook them at home now =). Both Manuel and Veronica are super nice and welcoming. In addition to learning how to make these dishes (and dulce de leche), they taught us about wine and some Argentine geography too! The wine they paired with the food was fabulous and we had a great time relaxing, cooking, and enjoying Argentine food and culture. A must do for Buenos Aires!!"

There were 8 of us cooking, but the atmosphere was like being at an interactive dinner party with friends, even more so because the class is in their beautiful home. The empanadas were without a doubt the best I have tasted and I have tried quite a few in different parts of Argentina. We learnt the tricks to making a perfect flan, dulce de leche and some delicious tangy salsa to accompany the empanadas. Veronica was in charge of the wines and they didn\u2019t disappoint - a beautiful white and a bold red, both had been so very carefully selected.\u00a0After the class Veronica emailed with the recipes, which are easy to follow. I feel confident that I could recreate the dishes we learnt. This is one of the best activities I have found in Argentina - thank you both so very much!\u00a0"

What could be better than a boat tour of the Delta Tigre followed by learning out to cook an amazing asado (grilled steak dinner) on a beautiful day in Argentina? The tour director and I met up with Veronica and Manuel and headed out to the marina to grab a private boat into the Delta. We dropped Manual and Veronica off at the Dutch-inspired lodge where we would later meet up with the for the cooking class. The tour director guided the boat out into the Delta to see the fantastic island cottages, bird life, and secret jungles on the river. We returned after an hour to start the cooking classes with Manuel and Veronica. Manuel guided me through all the steps to make a fantastic caprese empanada. We prepared the fresh salsas and I even got a knife skills lesson! The fire was lit and we cooked everything, steaks, empanadas, chorizo, provolone, and potatoes on the grill. I am excited to try grilling empanadas on the grill back home! With each course, Veronica paired an organic Argentinian wine that I will definitely be loading up to take home with me. We topped off the day by learning how to make dulce de leche filled crepes. I learned so much on my outing and I know it will be one of the highlights of my trip to Argentina. I had so much fun I even signed up for the Mate class later in the week!! Tip: Make sure you wear comfortable and appropriate shoes for the boat. This is a tour best for a smaller group (maybe 3-4) in order to get the full experience. Bring your appetite!"

My brother, our wives and I spent five days and four nights in BA during the 2014 World Cup, and this was easily the one part of our visit that I would recommend to anyone planning a trip. Tours, tango lessons, great nightlife and restaurants are all great stops, but for each there are a variety of great options. For a cooking class, Tierra Negra should be the number one option for anyone looking for a relaxing evening with extremely welcoming hosts who provide the true insight into the real BA that you won't get from most tour guides. We had a private class for the four of us, and wine, and a basic description of the different wines and wine regions of Argentina, were provided throughout the class to add to the relaxation and enjoyment of the evening. Both red and white were offered, but Veronica had no problem providing one or the other based on the tastes of the members of our group. Manuel did most of the cooking of the empanada fillings (traditional and vegetarian), so some may be disappointed to not be completely hands on, but this added to the relaxation of the evening - not to mention the taste when the empanadas were done. We did, however, mix the dough, portion it, roll it out, and fill and fold each empanada, which was enough to make us feel involved without any hint of pressure to get it perfect. Manuel and Veronica were great hosts and very open and informative during our class. Veronica helped us out by grabbing the camera and snapping photos while we were elbow deep in dough and filling. The empanadas were delicious, and we were emailed the recipes for use at home. The recipes hold up.One bonus: While in the class we started discussing the beer of Argentina. Don't get me wrong, Quilmes isn't bad, but as fans of craft beers, we were looking for something better. After the class, Manuel and Veronica took us to a bar in the neighborhood that sold only Argentine craft beers, and they were very good. Not only did we get to hang out with Manuel, Veronica and other BA locals, but we got to cap a good night off with some great local beers before heading out of town. Even if Manuel and Veronica can't join you, if you're a craft beer fan, ask them to give you directions to the bar."

Let me just start off by saying the young couple that ran this were divine and extremely friendly and we wish them the best, but we walked away a little dissapointed in the cooking class experience. They are just starting off, so hopefully this feedback will be helpful to improve. 1) I have attended cooking classes in various destinations: Italy, Napa, Thailand and Japan. If I sign up for a cooking class I expect to learn how to cook several local dishes. The empanadas Manuel showed us how to make were excellent and the best part of the evening. The only other dish we learned about, really just watched, was flan, which is the same as flan in every other Latin America country...We picked up a couple local cookbooks later in the week with great recipes for local dishes like stews, asados, other regional empanadas, and desserts. We would have liked to have learned how to cook additional dishes. 2) The apartment it was held in was fine, but slightly awkward entering a strangers apartment3) The wine we tasted was good, but nothing special. Wine is such a big part of the local culture, that a more extensive tasting would have been appreciated. Like I said, cooking classes are a great niche for Buenos Aires with a bright future, but this school needs to improve to be a 5 star rated activity."

Veronica and Manuel are incredibly friendly and accommodating. The class is hosted in their lovely apartment and it felt like we were having dinner at a friend's place. Manuel is a chef by profession, and he showed us how to make empanadas and flan with dulce de leche. The class is part hands-on (making empanada dough and filling/folding them) and demonstration (ingredients were prepared ahead of time, flan was a demo only). Manuel is very knowledgeable on food and flavours, and he offered a lot of good tips for home cooking and experimentation. Meanwhile, Veronica introduced us to three Argentinian and Chilean wines, each with unique flavours. The resulting meal was delicious! We made a ton of empanadas and only a few were left at the end of the night. The flan was incredible and my friend and I polished off half the bowl of dulce de leche between ourselves! A great evening filled with good food, good people and great conversation. A truly unique experience that is highly recommended."

We had a fantastic evening, Veronica and Manuel are great and cordial people. We were happy to learn how to do flan, dulce de lece and empanadas!We also really loved the wine we were introduced to during the evening (great taste, Veronica!).After this great evening, we had the feeling that we had spent hours with friends from university combined with a cooking class. Great!I recommend this course to everyone who wants to find out how to cook typical meals from Argentina und who wants to learn more about people and culture from this amazing country!"

The learning experience was terrific but the fact that they made us feel so welcome in their home really made the experience outstanding.

The ingredients were of the highest quality and Manuel's instruction/explanations were fantastic. The setting is small in their gorgeous flat and it was so much fun rolling the dough, crafting the empanadas, and then eating the INCREDIBLE outcome. We also got to try very generous pours of absolutely delicious wine, which fueled the fun even more. Manuel and Veronica were perfect hosts and I loved getting to know them and the other participants over dinner and dessert. My boyfriend and I both look back on this class as one of the best things we did on our trip. I only wish the class could have been even more hands on in the making of the dessert and fillings, but it was truly a fabulous experience. The class was taught entirely in English but we were also able to practice our Spanish as well."

Their apartment was conveniently located in Palermo near our hotel. Veronica warmly greeted us at the door, and we immediately felt welcomed into their home. We were the only guests because Veronica and Manuel usually don't schedule their classes on Sundays. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening! My wife has much more experience cooking than I, but Manuel was extremely patient with me, although my efforts were the subject of a lot of laughs by all. Manual told me my empanadas had some of the weirdest shapes in the history of his class. In the end, the empanadas were delicious. The food was accompanied by some great wines. Veronica initially served a fantastic Malbec...Finger Print. I hope I can find it in the US. She also introduced us to Torrontes wine , which is a white wine from northern Argentina. It was incredibly good. We ended up buying some Malbec and Torrontes wines before we left Buenos Aires. Both Veronica and Manual were extremely knowledgeable about food and wine. After dinner, we had a very enjoyable discussion with Veronica and Manual about Argentinian life and culture. When I finally looked at my watch, I realized we had been there for several hours, and I was embarrassed we had been there so long. This is a must do in Buenos Aires!"

I really loved this and it was definitely my highlight for several reasons: (1) Manuel and Veronika made it feel like I was in the home of very good friends. I did The Argentine Experience as well, and while that was fun, it was a far second to this experience. Manuel and Veronica welcome you into their home and give you the real porteno experience. Plus they are a really cute couple with perfect English. (2) I learned a lot! Manuel is an excellent teacher even for the \"culinary challenged\" like me. And Veronika is pretty smart with the wines of Argentina. She is also a very generous pour!! :-) (3) It was hands on! We got to do it ourselves, which was extremely satisfying and gave me confidence to try the recipes at home. Side note: I'm pretty fussy about hand hygiene and I was really impressed with their attention to hand washing, etc. (4) This is an amazing meal! I was stuffed!!! Lots to eat and lots to drink. All Argentine. A great value for money in my opinion. (5) Highly entertaining. I laughed so much!!! So don't even second-guess doing this. HIGHLY recommended!!! These are just really good people and you are going to love to meet them!!"

We had an intimate class of four people: my wife and I are avid cooks, and the other two don't cook at all. Manuel was an excellent teacher, with every demonstration and technique. He encouraged everyone in their empanada skills, and the results were wonderful. Veronica shared great tips about the three Argentine wines, which were generous and delicious. One of the best parts of the class is that the recipes are emailed at the end of it. We have made the dulce de leche and the empanadas so far, and they taste as good in our kitchen as their did at Veronica and Manuel's!

We had a wonderful time last night learning how to cook traditional Argentinian dishes.The location is in the residence of Manu and Veronica and is very cozy and professional. It was hard to believe that people actually lived there because it was so tidy.We had a special experience because due to the way scheduling worked out we had a small class, 4 people in total, and were able to have a very intimate experience. They mentioned that they have classes up to 8-9 people so we felt lucky.We started off by learning how to make the dough for the outside of empenadas.... and took pride in being told that we were the first ones to ever call our creations 'flour babies.' Since I don't have much experience cooking, this was my first time making dough from scratch. You add water, some oil, and flour, and the knead it for a while, and then add more flour... and then knead some more... I felt like I poured a lot of my life into that sucker. Then you shape it into a round, semi-spheric object and put it in the fridge. I admit, I had to give my 'flour-baby' a kiss before I sent it off.Then he showed us how to make the insides of the empenadas from scratch, 'beef' and some other things I can't quite remember... At this point, the wine tasting portion really got going... and they made sure our glasses were never empty.In the end, we had a blast making empenadas and flan and dulce de leche (I admit that I ate a spoonfull of this stuff by itself...) and getting to know the other guests as well as the wonderful Manu and Veronica. We talked about the current politics in Argentina and all sorts of other things (that are a little fuzzy due to the unending wine). It was great conversation. Things went well beyond the typical end time because everyone was having such a blast.I should also mention that the meat they used in the empenada was so good it made a 5 year vegetarian fall off the wagon despite the fact that they provided delicious vegetarian options.It was everything I looked for when I travel to foreign countries. Learning about the culture, interacting with locals, and doing something interactive to make something.The other awesome thing was that they made sure that all the beef was from organic grass-fed sources and the vegetables were all organic as well. This was something that particularly stood out to us. Manu works officialy as a chef and has a special appreciation for these things.It was a magical night and a wonderful way to start off our trip in Buenos Aires. I wouldy highly recommend this to anyone coming out here."

Manuel already had the dulche de leche on the stove, but explained the process in making it as we sipped wine that Veronica selected for the occasion. We also made dough for our empanadas, observed Manuel putting together the ingredients, and of course drank some more. The most hands-on portion of the night was filling and rolling the empanadas, which was way more fun than I had anticipated. At times the class felt a little \"hands off\", but there's really no point in a group of 4+ chopping, stirring, and bumping into each other while in the kitchen. Manuel does a great job of explaining the thought process of all the preparations and it's honestly quite pleasant to sit back and observe, glass of wine in hand.Once all the food was prepared we ate together, drank more, and had great conversations. That is truly the standout point of the night -- meeting new people, engaging and trading stories. Veronica and Manuel sent out the recipes after the class so we'll have them for reference.

This is more than a cooking class!My only regret is that I don't live in an area that tourists frequent so I am unlikely to have the opportunity to return Manuel and Veronica's hospitality. Highly recommended!"

We are here for four months, and this cooking class has been an absolute highlight of my trip so far! Veronica and Manuel are incredibly friendly people who welcome you into their apartment, and Manuel is an excellent instructor. Lots of information and instruction, and entertaining too! And of course the food we made was incredible!! The wine was free flowing and our sobremesa (after dinner conversation) went on for hours. Lots of fun getting to know the other couple attending the class as well as one of Veronica and Manuel's friends who stopped by. What a fantastic night!!"

Enjoy a wonderful evening with great conversation, excellent wine and outstanding food at Manuel and Ver\u00f3nica's Tierra Negra Cooking Class and Wine Tasting. Manuel and Ver\u00f3nica are a delightful couple and you will be pleased to have spent an evening with genuine Argentinians who generously open their home and share all of their knowledge of BA, Argentina, wine and cooking with you. Manuel is a professional chef by day and teaches the class at night. Ver\u00f3nica keeps the wine and conversation flowing. Before you arrive, Manuel has done most of the chop and prep work so that you can focus on dough consistency, forming the empanadas, enjoying the conversation and wine. These are, by the way, the best empanadas by far that I ate during my 8 day stay in BA and I sampled them daily at every possible locale. Manuel's Flan and Dulce de Leche were also fantastic. Aprons, wine and all ingredients are provided so all you need to bring is your appetite for good fun, wine and food.A couple of comments...I went alone and there was a young married couple there. Singles are warmly welcomed. This would also be a great family activity for older kids or a good professional team, bonding experience. I think the class description says 7-10 pm, but it was well after midnight when I left their home. Ver\u00f3nica arranged for a reputable taxi service to get me back to my hotel. Try to schedule your cooking class early during your stay in BA because Ver\u00f3nica and Manuel are so knowledgeable they can give you lots of good tips on other things to see, do, places to eat, shop, etc..Thanks for a wonderful evening out."

Once we arrived he was VERY accommodating to our jet lag, to our tourist schedule and even helped out by emailing us places to go and see. I generally found most Argentineans to be hospitable and kind.but let's talk about the tango:I am still in bliss coming back from this trip. why haven't i learnt this before?it is so hard but Alejandro and JouJou work so closely with you. and Alejandro happens to be a clinically trained psychologist and has been able to incorporate therapy into dance. i know this because I felt it!! What better than two highly educated and qualified instructors?I am definitely not a tango pro by any means... we had 10 lessons but i know for certain i learnt all the basics and Alejandro and JouJou helped my friend and I build a strong foundation so that when we take lessons in the near future elsewhere we will have the perfect foundation to go on.

Over a week in mid-December, the two of us took seven lessons with the superb Alejandro Gee, whose tango-teaching partner was the equally superb Jou-Jou. We both wholeheartedly agree with the views of the person who wrote the review below dated Oct. 15, 2015 (and also with the excellent review below by \"Crysiel K\"). Alejandro and Jou-Jou's patience, attention to detail, determination to ensure that their students are learning proper tango, and their willingness to answer any and all questions, plus just their natural intelligence and nurturing temperaments, and yes, the very lovely space -- all made for a learning experience that exceeded our expectations and that strengthened our love of tango. It also made us realize the value of private lessons with a couple, for the reasons stated in Crysiel K's review below."

I was struck by his careful attention to detail and dedication to maintaining the authentic milonga style Tango. He is quite serious but also patient and lighthearted in his approach. I highly recommend his class to anyone who is serious about investing in a dance education with intent to pursue the 'real' tango traditions. Although less important, I would add that the dance space itself is beautiful and sure to put you in a nostalgic mood. It's true that you can find a class for a small fraction of his price, but like everything in life, you get what you pay for. Alejandro is the real deal."

I really enjoyed their teaching style. At first they separated us for one on one instruction. Alejandro concentrated on helping my dance partner focus on listening with his body to me and to the music. Jou Jou focused me on elongation, that my movement starts above the waist. About halfway through the lesson, they built on the first half by bringing my dance partner and I together to experience as one what we each had learned separately. From their private lesson, besides learning the essentials, I was also able to understand and internalize the precise body movements through their teachings. Their teaching style went beyond mechanics into the feeling and essence of Tango.I got compliments on the dance floor right after taking their lesson. It's amazing! I will take every future opportunity to take lessons from these great teachers.Crysiel K.G"

Stressed out from working in a large Middle East cancer hospital I made a spur of the moment decision to take myself off to Buenos to de-stress and to indulge my passion for dancing!Having taken a few \\argentine tango lessons some ten years previously in my home country of New Zealand I had the idea to learn the traditional milonguera style tango danced in the traditional milongas of Buenos Aires.My first lesson with Alejandro Gee, an Argentinean with perfect English and a double degree in psychology from USA was at first thought a little disappointing in that he asked me to forget all previous knowledge I had regarding his beloved art of tango mionguera?! However, putting ego aside I agreed (with myself probably more than with him) to give it my best shot?!During the next ten days I was slowly but methodically introduced to excellent technique, intricacies of musicality, the warmth of the embrace and I was ''worked on\" to correct my postureand most interestingly I was made aware of how the stress in my life was manifesting in my dance style, something very obvious to me now when I review video clips of my dance lessons!This gentle, modest but quietly commanding man and his graceful, beautiful tango partner Jouyou prompted, cajoled and even physically prodded me at times in effort to make me aware of the shortcomings in my posture! \"Straighten your lead leg, lengthen your torso, hold your head up and numerous other instructions were gently but succinctly and repeatedly drilled into me in effort to allow me to succeed!Milonga etiquette, attire and wonderful, almost secret tales of the Buenos Aires tango scene, it's milonga characters, especially the old milongueros were shared with me.My passion reignited, I almost missed my flight home as I happily got ready to go to a milonga! I ended up stuffing, rather than packing my bag, arriving with very little time to spare at the airport?On return to work my manager commented on my renewed vigor and suggested that we immediately fly Alejandro to the Middle East to use his special style of tango therapy on the rest of the staff here in our multi-national Operating Room Suites!My own suggestion for anybody looking to begin or to improve their tango skills (alongside their mindset) would be to \"pack all your troubles in your old kit bag (along with your tango shoes) and head off for a whole bunch of lessons at Alejandro Gee' s beautiful home studio!Go with an open mind and enjoy the experience, who knows, maybe you'll learn way more besides the beautiful tango that he's dedicated himself to teaching?A big thank you Alejandro and Jouyou!I will definitely be back for more!"

We had tried group Tango lessons on prior visits to BA as well as during a cruise, all to no avail as the few steps we tediously learned did not take us far on the dance floor. Having decided we needed a more personal approach we contacted Alejandro thru his website and he responded promptly and we arranged for at least one lesson depending on the results. Alejandro welcomed us warmly into his beautiful studio in a turn of the century building that is very evocative of the Tango. After his beautiful and charming assistant Jou Jou arrived our journey commenced. We soon learned that to dance the Tango both your mind and spirit need to be aligned with your feet before you can take a single step. The process begins with proper posture, breathing and most important balance. Who knew it would be so intense! It is not easy to realign your movements and they were both very patient and gentle as the led us thru the basics in order that the actual dance would flow from our soul and not from just our feet. We soon realized we were in for a transforming experience as the hour flew by. We arranged for another lesson before we left, wishing that we had more time with Alejandro and Jou Jou ... we were hooked! Even after two lessons we still struggle but knowing the basics and understanding the importance of the mind set we are looking forward to many hours of practice at home as well as more lessons on our next visit to BA. Gracias Alejandro y Jou Jou for releasing our inner Tango!PS Alejandro even sent us home with music to practice by"

I booked a tango lesson for myself with Alejandro Gee after seeing the reviews on Trip Advisor and also because his studio was close to my rental apartment. I had mixed feelings because I\u2019m an intermediate level tango dancer wanting to improve my dance, whilst most reviews were from people seeking to experience tango while on holiday. Anyway, I thought I\u2019d give him a go. It didn\u2019t take me long to recognise Alejandro as someone who had been raised and nurtured in an Argentine Tango cultural environment. The dance, the music, the spirit \u2013 I felt that all of these were at the heart of the man he is. Alejandro is a milonguero style tango master with an understated elegant style, and is a dream to dance with. He possesses a modest teaching manner but even so, I quickly learned that lessons with him would mean some hard work from me. I booked a lesson a day with him for the rest of my stay in Buenos Aires (about nine lessons). He and his assistant, Jouyou, worked tirelessly to improve my posture and balance, and taught me a greater respect for musicality in my dance. I learned so much from them both.  After each lesson, Alejandro recommended the milongas I might like to attend in the evening. As a result I had a great time dancing the night away at the BA milongas, and meeting local people as well as tourists from all over the world. I did become ill in BA and I will never forget Alejandro\u2019s kindness to me. Before I left, he invited me to join him and his friends for lunch at his stunning dance studio. He was the perfect host and I spent a very happy afternoon enjoying the conversation which mostly centered around the BA tango scene. It was a light-hearted afternoon with lots of laughter and a definite highlight of my time in BA. Thank you Alejandro. Alejandro Gee is the real deal and I can recommend him to tango dancers of any level seeking to improve their technique."

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it turned out to be a really neat experience. We didn't learn \"how to tango\" per se. We learned how to move as a couple - how to feel and anticipate each other's movements. It was a cool learning experience - it was different. The tango takes years and years to learn, but what Alejandro did for us in 90 minutes was introduce us to the subtle nature of what tango is at its core. Notes: If you want to sign up for a lesson, just send him an email. He was quick to respond and set up a session. He only accepts cash - preferably $US. Wear flat shoes - athletic shoes are fine for a guy. I think I wore boat shoes - which were fine. This is a great class for beginners or experienced dancers."

An article described Alejandro as an excellent teacher, fluent in English and having a degree in clinical psychology. \"Sounds like an interesting person - I'd like to meet him\", I thought. Plus, I was looking for accommodations and Alejandro's website said he rented rooms in his home to students taking tango lessons with him so it was perfect for me.Alejandro replied quickly and comprehensively to my email. I got the prices for lessons and room and his address and house rules. Everything I needed. He sent helpful reminders leading up to my stay with advice on money changing and airport transfers. When we met, I found him polite and very responsible. In Argentina, many things don't work as efficiently as it does in the first world. Alejandro however was always on time and reliable. Quite a breath of fresh air in Argentina. Alejandro takes his teaching and classes seriously. I think his clinical background allows him to tailor his teaching approach a little to what he reads of our personalities. He strives to give us what we need. Besides the technique, he also gave me some insights into aspects of my personality that could be connected to how I dance. It was interesting as it is something I could reflect on and work on (if I wanted to, he doesn't pressure or critique, merely observe and suggest).Alejandro is very busy generally with lessons and admin in between. But, a benefit of staying with him over Christmas and not having plans was that he kindly invited me to a Christmas eve dinner he threw at home for a few of his friends, some of whom I got to know better at milongas. Through the interactions with him and his friends I learned a lot about the world of tango, the drive to perfect the dance, the attraction of the milonga world, and the parallels between tango and life. I would recommend Alejandro to couples who want to learn more about dancing together as a couple, or students on their own who want to learn about more tango and improve their technique. It doesn't matter if you're a beginner like me or at the top of your game and just want some pointers, the lessons are quite enjoyable (there is a lot to pick up during the 75 mins!) and useful. I also recommend staying with Alejandro for students who want an off beaten track accommodation experience. I like AirBnB-ing and \"homey\" personal interaction with locals, and living among them. So staying with Alejandro was great as he could give me tips on whether to buy an electrical adaptor, get a temporary SIM card, buy wine etc. Of course, he can tell you about milongas and where to buy tango shoes (quoting him as my teacher I got a 15% discount at Neo Tango shoes near his place, for cash payment in AR$). His place is in a quiet residential street near the city centre. It has really old world charm decor. The one thing not so great about the location of Alejandro's casa tango is if you have to go to Palermo a lot. I had to (my friends all stayed there, and my yoga studio is in Palermo) and it was a bit of a hassle having to commute there daily. 25 mins by taxi (AR$55) or bus."

From the very first moment you feel how much experienced he is (globally). Doesn't matter what country you are from, my impession is that he's got this ability to find way to communicate smoothly with everyone. And the atmosphere he creates - you feel very precious - not because thanks to you he earns money - because he really wants to teach you as much as possible during one lesson. No rush - although you are aware of the fact he is very busy and popular - your lesson is your time - you feel like everything disappears - it's only you, him and tango. You will not get the impression \"hurry up! Another person is waiting\". Alejandro Gee makes you realise how much you can achieve in your life if you do things with passion. Hope your popularity will not distroy anything and you stay as you are. It's difficult but I wish you all the best!pozdrawiamUrszula"

He is in the inner circle of an eccentric, charismatic, well known brotherhood of much older Milongueros that frequent Cachirulo and other traditional Buenos Aires milongas. Unfortunately these older Milongueros won't be around for too much longer.

I wrote him an email and he responded to me in less than an hour. Then I found out that Alejandro travels to US from time to time to teach tango so it was quite lucky for us that he was not travelling during the week and he was able to teach us tango. On our first private lesson, My wife and I were quite nervous as we never tried tango before. But Alejandro and Joujou taught both man and woman's role step by step with great patience. And they explained in English everything very well and easy-to-understand. So right after the first lesson, we decided to have another lesson on the next day and we ended up learning tango everyday while we were in BA. It was so much fun! At night time, we also tried a couple of milongas that Alejandro recommended in order to see and experience the atmosphere and culture. And it was an amazing experience we had. Overall, we concluded that Alejandro and Joujou didn't just give us great tango lessons but they really showed Argentinean kindness and warmth. We are now big fans of tango and Buenos Aires thanks to Alejandro and Joujou and their great tango teaching! Now back in New York, my wife and I are planning to continue to tango and looking forward to visiting BA again for another lesson from our great tango maestro."

He is a fantastic teacher and I can't wait to go back to BA and work with him again. It was my first time learning Tango and Alejandro was the perfect instructor - he is patient and wonderfully encouraging - and he gave me not only a lesson in dance, but a terrific understanding of the the cultural experience of Tango. My lesson was relaxed and focused - and Alejandro's studio is lovely and welcoming. If you are lucky enough to go to BA, you'll add a wonderful experience to your trip with a lesson from Alejandro.

He was in town touring the Northwest, with stops in Vancouver (Canada) and Montana. Every tango teacher has something different to offer. And many times, what you get, depends on where you are at. This time around my experience would be mainly technique, and dancing in the context of the music and orchestra.One of the highlights for me was learning drills and technique for keeping the knees straight when walking. Now my movements are more precise and clean. Usually learning technique takes personal feedback. Although I took a private and had just that, Alejandro also did a good job of circulating around the room during the workshop.My favorite class was Alejandro fitting his mindset and movement, to the 4 major orchestras in turn. In a short period of time, he was able to present a framework for how to approach a given tanda.Alejandro is professional, patient, and focused on the feeling of the dance which is oftentimes quite hard to to teach!"

They taught me from scratch, learning the posture, the stance and the breathing even before taking a step. it was amazing to feel the tango movement. i didnt think i would be able to accomplish as much as i did, as it didnt come naturally for me, however with the fundamentals being reinforced, amazingly the understanding of the dance began. The experience taught me so much about myself, I'm sure I will continue to tango at home. We also visited a milonga recommended by Alejandro, and this experience gave us a much better understanding of the culture of tango."

I can say that for both of us these classes exceeded our expectations and we were sad to see Friday, and our last lesson, arrive. Our plan is to return to Buenos Aires to once again enjoy this remarkable experience and, of course, this remarkable city. Alejandro and JouJou teach the traditional Tango, not as a series of memorized steps, but as a process, as a sense of communication, of movement together. They share the history of Tango, the culture and even where to attend a milonga, where they also attended. They both teach with skill, passion and understanding. And, especially for me, the emphasis is on understanding because nothing was natural for me. But they kept on emphasizing the fundamentals, and as a result in my life overall I have more awareness of my posture, my walk and the way I stand. As instructors Alejandro and JouJou wonderfully complement each other, each providing insights and feedback. Plus, each of the two people attending the lesson get individual attention throughout the lesson. I was expecting only one instructor, but was glad for both to be there and for the help we received from both.Most of all, I now have at least some understanding of the beauty of the Tango, how it brings people together for a kind of shared experience that is almost completely lacking in my native culture from the USA, certainly in any kind of dominant form. We are glad from our limited experience, and hope someday to attend a milonga and be dancers ourselves. As you will learn, there is much more here than just a dance!"

The location was great, very central and his dance studios are beautiful. I had only been learning tango for 8 months before I came and Alejandro started by going through the basics, deconstructing what I thought I knew and then putting it back together in the correct way! Alejandro is very patient, he speaks excellent English and he is extremely perceptive. I found it amazing what a big difference even small adjustments to my posture & embrace could make. By the end of the week I was dancing so much better, I was much more confident and was even going to the local BA milongas on my own - AND getting asked to dance! Back in London I have been complimented on my embrace and following technique several times. I would definitely go back for more lessons next time I visit BA (I am sure he will be just as good for learning more intermediate and advanced techniques) and I would highly recommend him as a teacher."

I took private lessons daily for over a week and made significant progress working on basic techniques essential for a good foundation in tango and an elegant form. Alejandro teaches about how to follow and lead rather than learning a fixed sequence of dance steps so that his students can dance in a creative improvisational style with different partners. A video of my dancing was made so I could see where I need to make corrections, which was helpful. Many of the tango venues in B.A. are teaching 'tourist tango'. Alejandro is authentic in his style, technique, and backgound. Many tango instructors teach only in Spanish, but Alejandro speaks excellent English which I found helpful in getting the most out of the classes. He has a beautiful studio with a wood floor, air-conditioning, and a real 'tango' ambience. He also taught me a lot about tango culture and gave me lots of good advice about where to dance in the city. You will find Alejandro to be a charming and interesting person to meet in your travels. There are so many tango instructors in Buenos Aires that it is hard to know which to choose. I am very pleased that I connected with this particular instructor and I highly recommend his private classes."

I had been dancing tango in my home country for over a year and had decided to stay for a while in Buenos Aires to speed up my learning.When I first heard about Alejandro and saw his ratings on TripAdvisor, I was sceptical, because the ratings appeared too good to be true. However, at the same time I was curious to try out a class, because when I saw him dancing in a video, his style was different from what I was used to. He danced much closer to his partner and did not appear to make complicated moves. I am glad I tried out his class.The first class I took with him and his partner (Erzebet or Joujou) was unlike any other class I had taken before. I was dancing with his partner, who constantly gave feedback about how my lead felt, while Alejandro was observing me from the side and correcting me as well.Alejandro and Erzebet do not teach tango steps, they teach how to step tango. They explained me to be stable on the ground, to make a connection with the chest to feel what the partner is doing, to have a nice embrace and to listen to the music.I have been taking classes once a week ever since my first class, because I keep learning from them. They observe very well what you can improve and explain it very well. Before meeting them, I was not dancing, I was thinking about how to guide (or force) my partner in a sequence of steps without being aware or caring about how my guiding felt. They made me aware about how I should keep my feet, knees, belly, back, chest, shoulders, arms, hands, head and much more so it feels comfortable for the partner you dance with.Alejandro and Erzebet will not learn you how to impress the people who are watching you, but they will learn you how to impress the people you dance with. For me, this is what dancing tango is about, it is not so much about giving a show as it is about having a nice feeling.Moreover, they are very friendly people who like to listen to you and their place is very cosy.I definitely recommend them to anyone, from beginner to advanced who is learning tango!"

We really wished we had stayed in Buenos Aires longer. Don't even think about taking other touristly group classes. Because Alejando doesn't combine your session with others, you really get your money's worth out of the 90 minutes as you have his undivided attention. Not only did we learn some basics of Tango but we became aware of our posture.. i.e. how stand and walk so we could fix that. We now are motivated to continue learning locally in Dubai !!

In spiritual circles, this is called grace. And Alejandro has that kind of grace in great abundance and it is symbolized by his other gracefulness, that which he has as a dancer. I was that abject beginner, middle-aged and hampered by a bum knee and a bad back. And I could not have felt more welcomed, more encouraged and more well taught than I did with Alejandro.

I learned more about Buenos Aires in my first ninety minute lesson with Alejandro and Zou Zou than I did in the rest of the nine days I was in town, unless it was what I learned at the two milongas to which they invited me. Utterly amazing. And as if that were not already more than enough, these two are not only great dancers and teachers, they are wonderful human beings.

First just once per week, but as we fell more and more in love with the dance we in the end took lessons as often as we could and went to Milongas maybe 2-3 times per week. If you are interested in seeing the authentic part of Buenos Aires I would strongly recommend anyone who visits Buenos Aires to take at least on lesson with Alejandro! He will teach you the feeling and the basic steps in just the first lesson. After a two to three hours you'll be able to dance in the milongas. It's also the best coulpes therapy you can imagine. We could go there in the middle of a fight, and leave newly in love. Fantastic. Alejandro and his girlfriend Erzebet are really friendly and invited us along to the Milongas they were visiting.

Alejandro and his assistant really know how to teach.It was really fun and I learnt a huge amount in a short space of time. Alejandro is really patient, encouraging and understanding.

If tango is one of the reasons you visit Buenos Aires, or you become intrigued with the intensity of the dance after visitng a milonga in the late hours under the dim lights, I would highly recommend you to spend some of your precious hours in town with Alejandro. Having booked a class with him after reading the Tripadvisor reviews, we arrived at his airy crimson red studio situated in a colonial-styled building with little expectation. It didn't take us long to realise it was definitely worthwhile to have a personalised class with instructors (Alejandro and his assistant Zouzou) who had a passion in what they were teaching. Apart from teaching basic steps they focused a lot in getting the fundamentals and postures right. My partner and I were either actively learning separately from Alejandro and Zouzou, or learnt to dance as a couple. After a short few classes we have already built up some confidence to move around the studio with our four left feet in the newly aquired steps. We would love to visit his studio again should we return to Buenos Aires in the future."

He is an excellent instructor -- very patient and great at breaking down the steps and mentality of the tango. He conducted the lesson in Spanish so I could practice my language skills (although he is perfectly fluent in English). I had actually taken a tango lesson before in London and it didn't go very well, but I felt really comfortable with Alejandro, and I learned a ton in only 90 minutes. It was one of the best things I did in Buenos Aires. I only wish I had time for a few more lessons!"

He taught us how to dance tango in a milonga with other real people like us, not in a theatre or in a tango show. This made a great difference. Posture, attitude, presence: the \"upper part of the body\" comes first, the legs follow naturally. We humbly aknowledged our poor tanguero level (we have been studying Tango only for 4 months) and tried to absorb every hint and suggestion, which were given with great patience. If you are looking for a convenient place to stay, he also offers confortable private rooms in his charming \"Tango House\" . Recommended."

Now that I am back to Chicago, I try to keep all his instructions in mind... My tango partners do note that I have become lighter, and that my ballance is better.

I took a 2 hour private lesson from him afterward. He's a wonderful and skilled teacher and a great dancer. I was a beginner and was experiencing a lot of challenges and yet he always made me feel like I could dance. And I told myself he must be a great lead to have made me feel that way. He's very patient, very clear and straightforward in his instructions and fluent in English. He never made you feel intimidated when you were not doing things right. What I appreciate the most is that he always made you feel relaxed, eager to learn and enjoy the dance even when you are not good at it. He picked up on my weaknesses after one dance and helped me improve them. He focused a lot on the connection and the embrace which is fundamental in tango. I would highly recommend Alejandro to anyone who is interested to learn and to enjoy dancing tango. Go to Buenos Aires, check out his studio at Tango Angelitos and try some of his classes.

This is because tango is about feeling and sensitivity, otherwise you are just doing gymnastics.I am just planning to visit his milonga in Buenos Aries, but I already put excellent mark.

After the lessons I heard rhythms and beats in the music I hadn't heard before. Alejandro specializes in the traditional \"milongero\" style tango and his lead felt authentic, sincere and gave me the confidence to focus on my role as follower. All leaders could benefit by taking lessons with Alejandro! I appreciated that Alejandro could quickly identify what I needed to improve my dancing and he patiently gave me opportunities to keep working on implementing his corrections into the dance in a way that was challenging and satisfying. It didn't take long before I felt confident dancing close embrace at the most established milongas.I would recommend scheduling as many privates as possible with Alejandro if you are in Buenos Aires for a short stay.

We had an excellent 3 hours tour with German through Palermo trying out some of the Argentinian classics with a nice bit of history for each.For anyone new to the city/country, this is a must for learning more about the culture.We started in a Parilla (name for a steak house) where we tried chori pan- the Argentinian hotdog, with sauces like chimi churri. This was goooooood!Next stops included parillas for empanadas with famous Torrontes sweet white wine and of course steak (bife de chorizo) with Malbec. We finished at a heladeria for ice cream- they have he best ice cream in the world outside of Italy here.Come hungry- best advice to give!!Or guide was German, a local, who is really passionate about his country and culture, and a really informative, charismatic guide.Highly recommend as a way to get a real flavour of Argentina."

A four course dining experience which consisted of incredible staples in Argentine cuisine \"Choripan, Empanades, Grilled cuts of steak with sides and some delicious Ice cream for dessert. Each course is had in a different restaurant all within a matter of minutes walking distance from each other. A great way to try the different food and see some of the area. At the start of each restaurant our lovely and knowledgable guide Nina would tell us all about the dish we were about to enjoy along with some some additional info on the food culture and some history of the area and the greater Argentina. Everyone in the group felt welcomed from the very beginning and we were all quick to having a great time which had nothing to do with the famous Argentine wine I'm sure ;)Highly recommend this tour to anyone looking to take in some of the culture and enjoy some great food while in Buenos Aires."

I'm not a foodie or even someone who has ever done a food tour before, but this one was a lot of fun and very tasty. This tour included the best steak I had in Argentina which is saying something because we were eating steak every day.German Landa was our tour guide and he was warm, informative, and very friendly. He also gave us enriching insights about Argentinians in general and the Palermo neighborhood in particular. Even if you don't do this tour I would recommend seeing Palermo and visiting a lot of restaurants. However, I would highly recommend this tour, and come with an empty stomach!"

While in Buenos Aires for a short business trip this past weekend, I signed up for the Parrilla Tour as a last minute lark. How fortuitous because it was hands down one of the best tours of its type I\u2019ve experienced in my many years of travels. Our beautiful, knowledgeable, and utterly charming tour guide, Nina, led our small intimate international group through the Palermo neighborhood from local haunt to local haunt tasting empanadas, choripan, and grilled steak and veggies, as we all sipped local wines and just had a tremendous meaningful afternoon together. The torrential downpour outside could and would have put a serious damper on a lessor tour, yet for our group it actually added to the fun and positive dynamic. What an authentic all-around treat!"

We chose this company based on the great reviews although I did read loads of reviews from other companies before making a decision I felt this company would be a good choice. It was!One thing that always swings a food tour for me is the person or people who own or run the company. I've actually found that tours being operated by people who are not necessarily native and/or who have spent time outside of their own country are of a far higher standard and have better organisation and reliability. Communication even at such a late hour was super and booking was easy. We found the meeting point without any issue and David was already there to welcome us.We went on the San Telmo tour as it fitted ours and their schedule. The food and tour is as described. We loved the little empanada place plus my sister said the steak in the last place for the meal was the best she'd ever eaten and I'd agree it was lovely and plentiful. We are not big drinkers but there was wine and beer if you wanted it.We didn't eat again that day. Thanks for a lovely tour!"

            "review": "5 Reasons You Should Go On This Tour.... 1. Price - As a budget-y traveler, I initially hesitated at the $79 price tag on this tour. Well worth it! My friend and I are pretty much on a $58 mas o menos budget per day and we blew it to do this tour. And there are no regrets! (Unlike some of the other times...) Can you go around and try this type of food on your own? Sure. But you won't get this experience. And the experience is worth your money. The conversation, people, information, extra effort from the company, delicious food, etc. is just the beginning. We were fortunate to have gone in \"off-season\" and got to do our tour with the owner, David. He was able to tell us about his small company and the other guides who do the tour. He puts in the time and thoroughness to make this small business successful and enjoyable for clients. Corners are NOT cut to give a \"tourist\" experience. 2. Food - I highly doubt we would have considered walking into some of these places on our own! A complete hole-in-the-wall parilla joint with the locals on their lunch break, the huge grill next to your table, the butcher cutting the meat, etc. I've had many a choripan during my time living in Ecuador, but never one like this. Even the wines were our favorites (even after two days of wine tasting in Mendoza! - not surprising because David used to be in the wine export industry.) The portions were not small and your glass of wine kept getting refilled. And finally the ice cream - yum!3. Location - You are not going to the \"lonely planet top choice\" spots. David has lived in Buenos Aires since he was 15 years old and spent a lot of time choosing the spots on the tour and building personal relationships with the owners. I would also consider choosing a location to see a new neighborhood - we are staying in San Telmo and went to the Palermo tour. You can ask him for recommendations for your neighborhood and try those later :)4. Information - I am not someone who goes on a food tour to learn about how they make the food. I go to eat good food. But you can't underestimate the extra information that David shared and that we learned. While we walked, ate and talked these were just SOME of the things discussed: the wine industry in Mendoza and Argentina in general, the political climate of the country (from our questions) about the current presidential regime and the past, the climate of the country regarding current political protests (a constant in Buenos Aires) and the economy, the food industry and specialties, the history of the buildings and neighborhood that we were eating in, the cultural traditions built around food like on Sundays and the 29th of each month, etc. The list goes on. And that was just ON the tour. There was an email before the tour with an attachment with recommended restaurants in every sector of the city and a guide to ordering meat (what are the different cuts, etc.) And even more - he sent us a follow-up email after the tour with information we had been asking about. We are leaving on a ferry to Uruguay tomorrow and he sent us a link to blog posts about the different company options. He even remembered that we were going to the Evita Museum after the tour! The simple touches that make a memorable experience and caring company.5. Chimichurri - There is an option to get a jar of their homemade Chimichurri recipe for $5. Do it! It is amazing.Book in advance and don't miss it. For backpackers that stray from these types of activities, consider it. Great company, people, food, and experience - what more can you want traveling?"

Having absolutely loved the first gastronomy tour we did in Lima, we had booked the Parilla Tour weeks in advance. We met on Tuesday July 2nd at Las Canitas at a Parilla at 12pm and lucky for us our host was David, one of the owners. We were joined by 2 Argentinians travel agents experiencing the tour for one of their clients, a Welsh guy and his friend - a total group of 6. After shortly being seated, the we were served Choripan and chimmichurri sauce. David gave us a history of the area which we were in, Palermo, and a brief overview of what our itinerary was. It was a walking tour with 4 stops in total where we get to experience restaurants which you would typically wouldn't visit.Next stop was Empanadas and White Wine. David explained that the Empanada is a typical Argentinian snack that differs from its Mexican and Spanish versions since they're baked instead of fried. Also that you'll find different regions of Argentina fill their empanadas different e.g. In the South they're often filled with Lamb instead of beef. We also tasted a \"white\" wine from Argentina. Although Argentina is typically renowned for their Malbecs and reds, we tried Torrentes which David explained Argentina was known lesser for however still popular amongst Argentine wine. Our third stop and I guess main stop was a Parilla - A tradition that cannot be missed. We were seated infront of the kitchen where David explained what a Parilla is - in terms of the open coal fired grill and how typical Argentinians cook their meats and prepare their grill. We learnt that Argentinians typically like their meat more on the \"done\" side and chatted over some tenderloin, side of grilled vegetables and grilled proveleta served with the staple chimmichurri and salsa. The tour ended at 2:30pm with \"Helado\" - Argentina's Gelato at Veikko which was another about a 5 minute walk. We were each given 2 scoops each and the ice cream although delicious was similar to a typical Italian gelato store. You were able to sample all the different flavors which was great. The tour ended with David giving us a list of recommendations of restaurants and bars in Buenos Aires as well as a short Spanish translation of meats and key menu items which was helpful given my friend and I spoke zero Spanish. I would recommend this tour to anyone short on time in Buenos Aires, first timers in Argentina and also for those who don't speak Spanish. It was a fairly quick food tour that hit all the typical Argentinian Staple \"must try\" items but I also feel like unless you tried really hard to avoid it, you would probably encounter all items featured in the tour at some point in your trip in Buenos Aires. The tour was well put together and a good way to eat like a local for a day and experience Buenos Aires like a local."

We ate and learned about everything from choripan and chimichurri, to empanadas and why the Argentines like their water with gas. And of course the meat was awesome. We dined at a cool parrilla (La Colorada) in Palermo, learned about the different cuts of meat and drank wine from the traditional penguino (of which we now have 4). I definitely felt that even though it was a tourist thing to do, we were going to places mosts tourists would pass right by. Santiago even gave us a list of recommendations for restaurants and bars for the rest of our stay in Buenos Aires (and even in Mendoza, which we headed to later).

Fantastic service.Loved our Argentinian version of the humble hotdog - choripan. So much flavour. We all decided NZ needed to adopt the same version. Trendy little empanada restaurant was next on our stop (or not so little as we found out they do over 3000 takeaway empanadas a day) matched with the delicious Argentinian Torrontes wine - yummo. The parilla itself was tender and tasty along with the grilled provolone cheese and served in a restaurant converted from stables. And our final stop at the heladeria was delicious, the ice cream melted into what little gaps we still had left in our tummies. David was easy to talk to and we found out all sorts about life in Argentina as well as food and wine. Great afternoon out. Would definitely recommend a tour with these guys!"

Time allotted was just right, price for what you get (especially if you are a wine drinker) is reasonable and Nina - our guide - kept things interesting. Not the usual touristy fare and probably brought me to places I would never have found on my own."

We decided to do the tour before hopping on our plane home, so that we would be in a little food coma and could sleep well on the plane. We were the only ones on the tour (it's off season right now)- only bummer there was that we were looking forward to meeting other people. David did ask beforehand if we would rather do the next day where we would be able to meet people, but unfortunately we were flying out. The tour was really great though. The empanada place that we went to was AMAZING. Seriously, the best empanada that I have ever had! And all the other food was also great. I actually liked the steak at the parillo on this tour as much, if not more, than Don Julio's (which we went to the night before, based on a many recommendations). The ice cream shop at the end was so authentic and delicious. Overall I definitely recommend this tour to anyone that is looking to get some good food from local restaurants. It's not a city tour, but David did make some recommendations for where to visit after our tour. He also sent us a great guide to restaurants around the city that I will use next time I come down!"

Then we went to a nice parrilla where we had a full course meal (I was already kinda full from the \"appetizers.\" At Gran Parrilla del Plata, we had a grilled cheese course (super tasty), salad, and various cuts of meat with various sauces. Of course, the meal came with wine. I ate more than I intended because it was all so tasty! Our last stop was for ice cream which was average. It was A LOT of food, so go hungry. Overall, it was a great way to start our trip...but I wish we got to hear more about the history of San Telmo. We spent more time chatting with the other guests and getting tips from them on where to go and what to do. Still worth doing."

Lots of beef and sausages, bread, salad, grilled cheese, etc. Finally we walked to a great ice cream shop that had 59 different flavors, many which were unique.

We traveled next to a beautiful open air restaurant and had some bbq'd cheese with sweetbreads (sounds crazy but they were good). Next came out a large platter of two types of beef but again, I was given chicken fajitas that were delicious! We waddled out of this restaurant and ended with two types of ice cream.

We learned of 14 different types; each can be recognized by the exterior design. We only got to sample one as we had so many other stops. In talking with the others on the tour, some had said they found this on trip advisor and pre booked. There were about 10 of us. Most were from USA or Canada. I suggest you do this early in your stay so you learn about the different foods. Then you know what to order as you explore on your own."

The experience isn't much different than getting four recommendations from a local friend and checking out the establishments yourself. I think they could make the tour more unique if they could explain/show more of what happens behind the scenes in the kitchen (i.e. how empanadas are made, the process for picking/grilling meat, etc.). The total cost of the meals is probably ~$20-25 usd/pp with wine so I would have expected this tour to be closer to $40-50 usd/pp. Especially since it's a pretty big group (ours was ~18 people). The upside is that you do meet a lot a great group of people through the tour. The total tour was about 2.5 hours long and you go to four places (1 for a \"BA version\" hot dog, 1 empanada, 1 for carne, grilled cheese, and grilled vegetables, and 1 gelato shop)."

However, the customer service was excellent. We received a prompt reply by email and received a full refund. I think we just visited on an off day."

We had a local beer, and the local chorizo with french fries. Next we stopped next door to see the big market, enjoying handmade empenlladas (which were the best we had on the whole trip!). Next we stopped at another local restaurant which used to be an old butcher market, had delicious wine, lunch, and felt like we were locals! We finished with yummy ice cream from another local shop. We have always had luck with tours like this because they really make your vacation more memorable than you could ever do on your own. Maria and Parrilla Tours didn't let us down! Fantastic job!

We went to places tour books would probably not suggest and were the only tourists there - which is exactly what we wanted. Food was delicious! Empanadas, choripan (sausage sandwich), steak lunch, and helado (ice cream). Beer and wine flowed at each place and we had a blast with Maria!I highly recommend this tour for people who want an authentic food tour and not just the typical tourist places.

The tour introduced us to our first (and sadly last) choripan and our first (and definitely NOT last) mascarpone helado. The parrilla we visited was great -- hidden and dripping with local color. If you are looking to get off the beaten food path a bit, I highly recommend this tour, especially if you don't speak Spanish and are a bit reluctant about wandering into a neighborhood joint on your own.

I am traveling in Buenos Aires alone, so half the fun here has been meeting new people on such tours who are also exploring the city (sometimes alone, but often with just one other person) and just as interested in the incredible food and wine as I am. At first I was unable to book this tour when I wanted to due to the fact that the company indicated they required at least 2 people. August is not yet the busy season here, so tourists were not as plentiful as when the weather begins to warm up. The staff were very kind, and of course offered to schedule a different day for me. I finally was able to settle on a Saturday, but on Friday was told that the other attendees had backed out and I was again the only one scheduled for the tour. The said they would honor the reservation if I was comfortable doing it alone (I imagine they felt a bit bad for me, having tried a few different days before finally finding one that worked).While I initially was disappointed I would not have fellow travelers with whom to share the experience, I was quickly reassured by the warm, friendly and quite knowledgeable tour guide, Maria. For almost three hours I had a private, un-rushed, delicious tour. Maria was welcomed as family in each of the stops we made, and by extension (and probably because they too likely felt bad for me being the only attendee) they too treated me like family. At one stop, I was even invited behind the counter to help with the grilling of our steak and the grilled provolone (which you must try if you haven't already)!!We stopped at four places in all: one for choripan (grilled sausage on a roll with various toppings); one for empanadas; one for steak; and the last for helado (ice cream). At each stop (with the exception of the ice cream, there was an opportunity to try new wines. And at each stop Maria provided a rich account of the food, the neighborhood, and the local culture.Could you visit these places on your own for less money (as some of the negative reviews have implied)? Sure you can. But I found the experience to be a great value. At no point did I feel like a tourist. At no point did I feel uninformed. If not for my guide Maria, her great personality and incredible depth of knowledge, and her reputation with the local establishments we visited, the value of this tour would not have been.The few hours I spent on this tour will forever be among the lasting memories I look forward to keeping of this incredible city and its people."

David was very knowledgeable and professional as our guide, and our group was very small with only one other guest. We got on with the other guest incredibly well and had a fantastic time on our tour with lots of laughs. However we wonder if it may have been a little more arkward if this had not been the case.The tour itself covers a very small distance, and I think it may be worth considering covering a bigger area so that the guests get a 'feel' for more of BA on the tour. We did a similar tour in Rio which covered a much bigger area and gave us a greater insight into the city.However, we enjoyed ourselves a lot on this tour and would recommend it!"

I wish we would have been able to do this on the front end of our tour, as our guide David had many great recommendations of places to eat and things to do. Sign up, then eat, drink, and be merry!********************************************************Here's my long version :-)Sign up was very easy on their website. I was able to select the tour and date and then pay online with no issues. We chose the evening Palermo tour. It was an easy cab ride from Puerto Madero to Palermo, and David was waiting at the first restaurant when we arrived early. All of the restaurants were within easy walking distance, and the neighborhood felt very safe, even after dark. Plan for 2-3 hours for the tour plus transport time. The starting restaurant is pretty far north in Palermo, so keep that in mind when planning. Casual dress is appropriate. Cab ride from Puerto Madero was about 130 pesos. Bring your camera and and empty stomach! We were joined by four lovely Californians (Go Stanford!). David is very knowledgeable about the Palermo neighborhood and the local food. He did an excellent job explaining local customs around dining and food choices. All the restaurants we visited were places frequented by the locals, so it truly felt like an evening out with friends. Everything we ate was DELICIOUS. Y'all, SO GOOD. We were able to have a different wine with each course. He was even able to get our steak cooked a lovely medium rare. Do not miss the grilled provolone! There was enough food that we felt like we had a full meal, and the ice cream at the end was creamy and light. Be sure to try the hazelnut and Bailey's! David, thanks for being such a great host and for making us all feel welcome at your table. We had a wonderful evening, and it was a great way to end my trip!"

We enjoyed food and drink at 3 parillas followed by a trip to a heladeria. We had so much beautiful food and drink, especially in the last parilla where we each ate lots of different cuts of steak, beautiful grilled veg and cheese. There was no shortage of food or wine/beer - if u have dinner plans after its probably best to reschedule! Definitely worth taking 3 hours out of your holiday to go - totally worth the money."

If you're looking for a culinary experience in an authentic Argentinian/cultural setting, then Parrilla Tour [Palermo] is unquestionably your one and only ticket to the most delicious, satisfying, and delightful dimensions in Buenos Aires. Frankly, I can't say enough wonderful things about this gem of an adventure. Mar\u00eda Jose, our host, was an exceptionally good-humored, knowledgeable, and caring guide. The entire time she treated us as if we were honored guests at her own home --- pouring beer/wine, serving food, filling us in on the historical/cultural significance of the Argentinian traditions, and going around to make sure that everyone was having a great time; in short, an absolute joy of a person to be around. And let me tell you about the food; the food was magnificent, too. The sausages, the empanadas, the beer, the wines, and the ice cream were all delicious and satisfying, but the meat dishes at El Bagual Parrilla were simply out of this world---some of the very best cuts of meat that I've had anywhere---and that from a hard-to-please meat/steak lover/connoisseur.Finally, and as if all that was not enough, Parrilla Tour also extends you the opportunity to meet some truly amazing folks from all over the world.Parrilla Tour was by far our most memorable experience in Buenos Aires. Don't miss out on this unique opportunity to taste some of the most delicious Argentinian dishes in truly authentic settings; places where the locals would go to enjoy a meal. HIGHLY RECOMMEDED!"

The main entree were two selections of beef - a steak and a skirt steak, served with a chimichurri sauce. The side salad of baby arugula with parmigiana was perfect. We all shared a nice Malbec. The walking tour ended with a choice of ice cream. We also received a list of restaurant suggestions by neighborhood. Some of which were familiar. Some are new, but that means more places to try.

I wish I could remember her name but she knew her stuff. She had all of the necessary foodie background on the cuisine and then added her expertise on the Argentine wines. We started with sausage sandwiches with twp sauces, one pork and the other a twist on what I'd call German, then on to empanadas with all sorts of fillings, then on the crux of Argentine cuisine, MEAT. We started with grilled provolone cheese with olive oil accompanied by freshly baked bread and chimichurri sauce, then habachi style grilled vegetables and then grilled porterhouse steaks, grilled beef ribs, and my favorite, blood sausage. I had not had blood sausage since I lived on a ranch in south Texas. Our culinary guide said that if the sausage is warm, scoop the sausage out like pate and eat it on bread. It was delicious. Even our Australian and Brit travelers thought it was the best they've ever had. All of these course, of course, were served with wine. We then finished with the helados. I had banana and chocolate chip. What a great way to end a great day...Book this tour. It is well worth the cost."

Wishing we could have participated in the new wine tour that was being offered, but guess that will have to wait for a return trip."

If you wish to spend a few very entertaining hours samling some of the great foods and wines of Argentina while being entertained & informed, Maia is your #1 guide! While the food & wine is great throughput the city Maria brings the entire experience together. A super non-stop tour for all ages Took two different tours with her & both were welll worth the experienceWould suggest taking a tour with Maria early upon your arrival in BA to help you understand the city & culture."

We had arrived in BA late the night before so we're feeling a bit tired and disorganised (had not had a chance to get Argentinian pesos yet) but I'm so glad we went on this tour- it's unique and a fabulous introduction to the diversity of Argentinian food and wine. David was incredibly knowledgable and helpful and we had a fun group. I would recommend this as something to do when you first arrive in BA, worth every cent! You will eat some seriously good food - so don't have too much breakfast..."

We to four different local establishments and had meals ranging from sausages to empanadas and a full steak dinner that we participated in helping to cook. Then ended with some of the best ice cream I ever tasted. These restaurants were off the beaten paths and not along the usual tourist areas. Santiago explained each dish as we enjoyed the meal.

We then continued on to the next local restaurant all within walking distance and had delicious empanadas. David was very informative. He is from Oregon and his mother is from BA so he is bi-lingual. We continued on to our next stop for the traditional parilla\u2014delicious melt-in-your-mouth beef. I would highly recommend this foodie tour to anyone.

The booking was confirmed promptly via e-mail. On Thursday morning we received an e-mail from Julietta advising that we were the only booking for Friday at noon and offering us the choice of a private Friday tour or to join a larger tour on Saturday. We joined the Saturday tour and were glad that we did, since the tour is more fun with a group. The two couples with us were delightful companions from the UK, India and the US. We enjoyed sharing travel and dining tips over the ample servings of food, beer and wine. Our guide, Maria, spoke clear English and was a great social director, helping us all to meet and enjoy our time together. Maria was also very knowledgeable about Argentine food and wine and a friendly and helpful host. Our tour began at a local Parrilla. It was the type of bar-restaurant that only a local would frequent, but the chorizo sandwich and local beer got us off to a great start. We then walked a few blocks to an empanada restaurant. The empanadas were fantastic, baked and flavorful. The empanadas were paired with white wine. Maria even called ahead to arrange for a special empanada for a guest with food allergies. After the empanadas, we walked a few more blocks to an historic restaurant that is noted for its adherence to tradition. We were allowed to stand behind the counter at the grill for photos. We enjoyed sausages, steak, ribs, grilled vegetables and the most amazing grilled provolone cheese rounds. The food was plentiful and more than the group could eat and we enjoyed some great Argentine wines again. After stuffing ourselves, we strolled a few more blocks to a gelato shop. The gelatos were beautifully displayed and there was an amazing choice of flavors and mixtures. At the end of our three hours together, Maria provided a list of restaurant recommendations. A few words of wisdom: (1) Be sure that you book this tour very early in your visit so that you can gain a better understanding of authentic local food and take advantage of the restaurant recommendations. (2) Instruct your taxi driver to drop you exactly at the meeting point. Ours dropped us about four blocks away and pointed us in the wrong direction. We had to ask several times for directions since we had forgotten the map that Parrilla Tours had e-mailed to us. Bring your map, our use Google on your phone. (3) Come hungry: the food and wine is very plentiful!"

We went to four different locations - at each the staff were great, and each offered a different type of dining experience which we really appreciated. SO great to have a local who is able and willing to explain every detail of your experience. I emailed her days later with a few general tourist questions and she answered them with great detail and suggestions. We would HIGHLY recommend this tour to those shortly after arriving in BA. Perfect way to start your trip and provide the foray into learning about BA. Thanks Maria!"

Maria's knowledge of the local area but also the country's politics and recommendations on where to go next make this a great thing to do at the start of your stay.

David was a nice guy and we had a nice group of people, but other than that it wasn't really a 'tour'. It was just walking in a straight line from one place to the next with not much of a talk in between. We really had to do our best to pull some information about the neighbourhood and the food out of David. Also, the 4 places we visited were no more than 1 - 1,5 block apart so we didn't really see much of San Telmo.Maybe the Palermo one is better, but we weren't that impressed unfortunately."

Santiago is extremely knowledgeable about his city and shared tidbits of information about food and culture throughout our 2.5 hour tour. At one point, he mentioned that it doesn't even feel like work and you can see that he means it - he enjoys just getting to know the food-loving people who come from all over the world and join this tour.As for the food itself - what a brilliant introduction to the treasured staples of Argentina. We visited four shops or restaurants, all within easy walking distance, and feasted on empanadas and choripan at the first two stops, before moving on to a parrilla where we sat down to sample two cuts of steak along with salad, provoleta and a lovely Malbec. Our small group of six really enjoyed getting to know one another and by the time we came to our final stop for ice cream (definitely get the dulce de leche!) we parted as friends. If possible, take this tour early in your trip as you will also receive a helpful list of restaurants and bars to take with you. Top it off with personalized recommendations from your guide and it's a great way to ensure the rest of your visit to Buenos Aires will be delicious. Buen provecho!"

Maria is fabulous - friendly, vivacious, enthusiastic, and completely knowledgeable in both Argentine cuisine and the delights of the San Telmo neighborhood. In large part due to her personality, our group of four (Maria + three participants) clicked almost immediately, and it felt like eating friends rather than going on a tour. I also deeply appreciate the fact that nobody was trying to sell us unsolicited photos or add-ons of any kind - Maria showed us the market because she wanted us to see/appreciate it. It helps that she knows everyone and the locals love her - as did we. I highly recommend this tour - if I hadn't done anything else in Buenos Aires, this tour would have been more than enough to make the long trip totally worthwhile."

Don't listen to people who tell you meat is always cooked well-done in Argentina. Everything we had was cooked to perfection.We were stuffed when we left, but managed to finish with the best ice cream I've ever had at our final destination.Our guide, Maria, was as good as the food. She was friendly, lively and full of knowledge on topics from the Argentinian wine industry to horse racing.

She taught us about how Argentinians eat and what they eat. She also taught us about Palermo,B.A. and Argentina.We were three women who had been touring all day and showed up early at the meeting place. We intended to just wait until the appointed time but Maria saw us, came out and immediately started taking care of our needs-even apologizing that the food was not ready! Within minutes we felt that she was our friend rather than a tour guide.The tour included choripan, a true empanada restaurant with a whole list of different types of empanadas, meat--true Argentina style and ice cream. At each stop our dietary restrictions were honored (gluten free and no pork). The walk between stops allowed us to further learn about the area. Maria is so easy going that we forgot she was a guide and really thought of her as our friend.This was truly one of the top highlights of a trip full of fantastic experiences. Thank you Maria for showing us the real B.A. and its food."

Up until this tour, I have never found Argentina to be my favorite style of empanadas. If you gave me a choice I would choose another country as my fave. However, this tour put me on to empanadas saltenas (place name: La Zoila). The best I've ever had in Argentina. Crisp, not too much dough, and if I'm not mistaken these were still baked like the rest of the country. Also nice, juicy and hot!"

Worth a try though.Then we went along to eat and learn all about the different Empanandas that are made in a restaurant that only served empanadas and they were delicious! They were made and prepared properly in lovely pastery which made a change from a lot you buy that are horrible. Made properly they are great.Then we went to a local restuarant which you wouldn't even know was a such as it's hidden. Full of the locals daily we had delicious parrilla meat, Itailian cheese, salad and red wine. The last stop was an Italian Ice-Cream for dessert which there was a big selection and equally great.

Santiago is really passionate both about food and the Palermo district and it was a really nice way to spend an evening and get to know the neighbourhood. The food we sampled was fantastic all along and we even went to a \"secret\" restaurant which is behind a closed door - unless someone is in the know, there is no way a stranger to the city would ever manage to step foot in the door.

Very hard to choose a favourite but the parrilla with lots of tasty, tender steak and amazing red wine probably wins but all were great!I learned a lot about Argentinean food and wine, and even onto wider areas such as history of Buenos Aires and much more. Maria is a very knowledgeable and fun guide, top marks!

It can be challenging to get a glimpse of a city's real culture and restaurants when you're unfamiliar and reliant on guide books, but Parilla Tour solves this challenge (in BA, at least!). We did it at the outset of our trip which I highly recommend - was a great introduction to the city, its traditions and neighborhoods, and the guides will give you scores of tips on where to eat/drink/go for the duration of your visit, no matter how specific of a request you have - it's like having a personal tour guide at your fingertips and makes the tour cost well worth it."

We went to a small Parrilla on a side street in a residential neighborhood. Although the sign outside said closed,the restaurant was clearly open and filled with families from the neighborhood.. The steaks,sweet breads,salads and malbec wine were all superb and a great bargain. The restaurant was pleasant and the service superb. David was a genial host and guide. This was a great evening. Highly recommended. Bill and Kay"

My husband and I are in Buenos Aires for a conference and we had some extra time to see the city. I spotted this on Trip Advisor and it was truly a great afternoon. Our tour guide, Maria, took us to an interesting series of small restaurants in the Las Canitas area of Palermo to sample different types of parillas. We might have just been lucky but there were about 10 other people-- all people we enjoyed talking to about traveling in South America. We started with Chorizo, moved on to empanadas, steaks of various types, sweetbreads and ended up with fantastic ice cream. Excellent food tour!"

The food was a good mix (chorizo sandwiches, empanadas, steak), though probably not ideal for vegetarians (we enjoyed when Maria mentioned that past vegetarians on the tour ordered chicken). The steak stop actually was a full meal complete with wine. Walking around the Palermo neighborhood was a nice way to work off the food and to see a bit of a non-touristy neighborhood. Highly recommend this tour and Maria as a guide if you have a few hours."

David, our guide was a charming and very knowledgeable host. We visited four different venues to experience local parrillas, including the \"Secret Parrilla\" which is not open to the public. We also had the opportunity to see the area on foot as we went from one location to the other. The last visit to an ice cream parlor where the the home-made ice cream was to die for topped off a very pleasant couple of hours. Don't miss this tour."

            "review": "Great Tour. My wife and I did this tour on June 25 with Santiago and Rocio. Both our hosts were very warm and gracious. The premise of the tour is exposure to the various stages of an Argentine barbecue - starting with choripan (sausage on bread with chimichurri), then empanadas, steak, concluding with ice cream. All four stages are at a different restaurants. There is a short walk between each phase of the tour which allows for conversation and working up an appetite for the next part of the tour. These restaurants seem to be off the beaten tourist track and cater to mostly portenas. We did the tour on the last day of a five day visit to Buenos Aries, so we had been thoroughly exposed to the food of the city before the tour. I think each type of food on the tour was the best we experienced during out entire trip. Lastly, the opportunity to interact with Santiago and Rocio added a depth of understanding of the city and culture that we would not have had otherwise."

We went on a food tour in Rome last year and learned and tasted so much that we wouldn't have otherwise, that we made sure to find a food tour in Buenos Aires to do. The concept of visiting authentic restaurants where the locals go and taste the typical dishes is exactly what we wanted. Our guides were wonderful at explaining everything and making sure the entire group had a good time."

Our family did a private tour with Parrilla Tours a couple months ago, and still remember the delicious food and wine, incredible restaurants, and most of all our welcoming and informative guides. The tour lasted around 3 hours and we visited 4 spots to taste food. If you prefer to dine at chain restaurants that lack in local culture this tour is NOT for you. The places we went to were the opposite of trendy, but were so real that the experience was beautiful and we would have definitely never found them or gone on our own. Buenos Aires has some incredible modern and international restaurants that we ate at, but we really wanted to delve into local culture as well, which this tour did very well. This was not a \"tasting\" tour, so come hungry and be prepared to ask any questions you want about food or anything else Argentina related. The value in this tour is the guides expertise in where to dine and explaining local customs."

The restaurants we went to in the Palermo Soho neighborhood were really great and we sampled a great variety of food. They introduced choripan to us and my husband was on a constant hunt for it the rest of the trip! Then on to empinadas, which were delicious followed by a Parrilla that was a bit of a secret local hangout. We felt very privileged to be able to eat here as the place is hard to find and when you do find it, it says it's closed! All this in an effort to keep the patrons limited to locals. We had a multi-course meal there and left STUFFED. Then we headed over to get some of the best gelato I've ever had. The guides were really friendly and knowledgeable and even sent us on our way with a little chimichurri mix to take home. I would definitely recommend this tour.

The next stop at a \"hidden\" restaurant ( for locals only ) was a major disappointment. We were really looking forward to some nice meat. There were 3 different types of meat served...one was so tough I couldn't cut it with the knife supplied...I ate NONE of it, the second cut was 80% fat and the third was of unknown origin (maybe cheek) but was at least tender. The salad and wine were nice, but I don't know how this restaurant is still in business serving that quality meat! I would have complained to the waitress had this been a personal dining experience. Our guides ate here too....but they made no comment.The final stop for icecream was sadly the best food of the day. Like I said, great concept, informative walk, but food served was well below average."

After doing a little research on google and Trip Advisor we decided Parilla Tour looked like the best choice for Buenos Aires. The booking and payment was simple and easy to complete, which set the tour apart from other Buenos Aires attractions even before the tour started. The day of the tour we arrived at the meeting point, the first restaurant, a neighorhood empanada and pizza shop near the San Telmo market. That day we were a total of 8 plus our local guide. After being given an overview of what we were going to do, we delved into the food, starting with a fantastic empanada fresh from the oven. Next we were given a brief tour of the San Telmo market and told its history. We exited through the far end and went to a small stand for a street food of Argentina, the chorizopan sandwich paired with chimichurri sauce, both excellent. The main stop was just a couple blocks away, a parilla where we had incredibly flavorful sirloin steak, grilled provolone cheese, and a very nice malbec wine. We finished up with an artisan ice cream. We really enjoyed the tour. The guide really added to the experience with their insights into the foods, the culture and recommendations, and most of all having completed the leg work in trying many restaurants to decide on the ones we visited. Keep in mind that they give a significant amount of food, so come hungry."

Firstly it's extremely overpriced: we paid 130 USD for 2 people which seemed reasonable when we booked it from home (London) but when we got to know the local prices, we realised how much we got ripped off! (see price comparison at the end of the review)Secondly, our guide wasn't chatty, didn't have interesting stories to share etc. She was nice but that's not enough! We met some amazing tour guides during our South American trip and she was definitely not one of them...Thirdly, the description is very misleading: it says you will go to 3 \"authentic local restaurants\", when in reality you go to 2 restaurants (both outside of 'rush hour' so you're alone in the restaurant therefore it's really not an authentic experience) and then you have some empanada on the street in front of a pizzeria. The only positive was the secret restaurant in Palermo which seemed as it was closed just to keep it's \"speakeasy\" appeal. If you want a true, 'off the beaten track' food experience in Buenos Aires, go to Paladar, a \"puerta cerrada\"(secret restaurant)! We had a 5 course gourmet Argentinian menu there with amazing local wines for 30 USD/person. And it's not just the food, but the hosts: Pablo, the chef and Ivana, his wife, the sommelier! Five star experience, highly recommend!"

My sister and I did this tour after being in BA for 4 days. The quality and variety of food was superb. The Palermo district is just beautiful. Sabrina our guide was brilliant. She made us feel welcome from the outset and gave us a background to all the culinary delights. My favourite part was when we went to the restaurant that is not opened to the general public. We also consumed some of Argentina's fine red wine The tour finishes with ice cream which I absolutely did not need! But was glad I tried because it was up there with the best I have tasted.Ticks all the boxes and great value for money!"

Both David and Sol were so welcoming and we also enjoyed chatting with the other folks on the tour. We started off with choripan which my husband really loved along with some wine. We then walked and had made to order empanadas. We were able to try different varieties other than your standard beef empanada. We then made our way to a local parrilla, of which there is no sign. You wouldn't even know by looking at the front that there is a restaurant. We had a lovely time enjoying the different steaks along with wine. Then we ended at an ice cream shop and enjoyed the local flavors.What made this tour wonderful are the special touches that David and Sol provided throughout the tour. We received some dining tips/guides to eating out and they also pointed out several points of interest throughout our walking tour. We never felt rushed and they really answered all our questions. They even gave us some tips/advice as we were leaving the next day for Mendoza. At the end, my husband and I decided to hang out at a local pub that David pointed out during the walk. Any new visitor to Buenos Aires will find this tour very worthwhile for the local and authentic experience!"

If you like hidden gems and aren't typically going to venture outside the beaten path on your own, this tour is for you. It was fun starting at a hole in the wall restaurant having chiripan and vino. Meeting everyone in the group and learning a little about the area, food and history. We then went off to have empanadas (for which we ate every day) and these were just about the best. They were only take away, so we ate them on the corner which was fun. You then head to a hidden parrila - gate says closed and looks like a deserted building, but behold a bustling place inside. I was daring and had the blood sausage and it was quite good. The melted cheese was fantastic. Have to say the steak wasn't the best we had on our trip, but was good overall. The final stop was ice cream which was really yummy. We didn't have any other ice cream while there so couldn't say it was the best, but it was very, very good. Overall this is a great trip but have to confess I believe it is a little over priced for those that would typically venture out on your own. However, if you would rather have someone give you a guided tour of a great area, great food, etc. it is just right. You will love hanging out with David and Santi - great guys."

I wish we would have gone on our first or second day so that we can try all the restaurants they recommend and talked about. Last stop was for ice cream and even though we were all full, we still ate it! :) And, thanks to our guides, they mentioned that there was a Polo match happening that day at the nearby polo fields. So we strolled over there (to walk off the food!) and caught a Polo match after the tour. Altogether a wonderful day. Well worth the money for the experience. I highly recommend."

            "review": "Ultimate insider food adventure.. We are great lovers of the grill and its tasty products. Argentine meats--especialy its fully grassfed beef that never sees filthy finishing lots, never needs antibiotics and is usually harvest at much smaller size than their US counterparts--are legendary. Our Parrilla Tour Buenos Aires outing offered meat for sure. but a lot more. The Argentine wood- and charcoal-cooking apparatus is the asado. That is the name for the device and the superb food that can be made on it. An asado is not the same as an American grill or and Aussie Barby. First of all the fat is collected by an angle iron cooking surface so it does not drip into the flames . The Vs in the cook surface channel fat and grease away the embers, not into them like our grills in the USA. So any smokey flavors are minimal at best and arise from the vacinity of the embers and the food, not flaming fat and smoke. The flavor of the asado meal is imparted by the cook, by carefully moving embers around the base of the cooker and also by moving the food away from or closer to those embers. The result is a slowly cooked massterpiece. Santiago, our guide, taught me--master American griller and BBQer at least in my own mind--about this while sitting in front of Oswaldo's metal and brick asado. Oswaldo's been cooking in St. Telmo for decades and grew up right across the street. He has been making choripan--wonderful pork sauage from a \"secret source\" served with a very lightly warmed bagguete and of course chimichurrie. This Argentine condiment is a gift to griled meats--especially beef. Oswaldo is the \"real deal\" and a man the locals patronize. Meeting him and eating his food was the highlight of this tour. Santiago is proud of the tradtional cooks he bring shis customers to meet'.including two eighty-plus abuelas, one makes the best empnadas I have ever tasted (ground beef, cumin hardboiled eggs, etc) and the other original and numberous fresh ice creams. We had pistachio, chololate, blueberry and of course dulce de lechie--marvelous flavors and gelato-like mouth feel. (The means a lot since we know great ice cream right here in Columbus.)Another stop on this fine tour confined to just a several block radius, was of course a parrilla. You will learn quickly in Argentina that the double ll is pronounced \"sh\". I did not see any other tourists while we had lunch at the parrilla Santiago had chosen,and we there at a busy time. SIrloin steaks and flank steak, both cooked on the asado, along with a simple but tasty salad of arugula and cheese; we also had provolonetta (grilled provolone cheese with oregano, chili and olive oil, and once again chimichurie). This was washed down with a Malbec roble.Santiago is well;known in this neck of the woods. He is intersting not just because of his love of food and his knowldege about the foodways of his country (he has been cooking asado since he has a child) but also because of his other interests such as leather design and furniture making. He is so good at what he doesin San Telmo, I doubt he will get much chance to do those other things for know. This tour was well worth the cost--all food is included."

We felt that without this tour we would have wasted a lot of time at mediocre restaurants and not getting an authentic Portena experience. Our guide went far beyond just guiding on the tour, and even made several restaurant reservations, got us half off on our ferry to Uruguay and arranged for a wonderful private driver to take us to Tigre the following afternoon. Secondly, even though we were a bit tired from our travel, the tour was relaxing and what better way to ease yourself into a culture than through delicious food and wine!

We had a terrific time with our lovely guide David (half American, half Argentine) on our magical mystery tour around a part of Palermo we didn't know.

David was very helpful in answering all kind of questions and giving tips for things to see or other places to eat, he even contacted a friend who contacted another friend in order to give my colleague some addresses of places where she could find some \"tango\" shoes. Good food, incredible good meats, as much wine as you want, a bit of history of the neighborhood and B.A., and great ice cream to end...you can't ask for anything better."

Both the food and wine were fantastic, and David had very good knowledge of the food and the city. He also recommended (and made a booking for us) a restaurant for dinner the following night which was a highlight of our trip."

I was a solo traveller in Buenos Aires in December 2013 and was a little hesitant to go wandering the streets late at night to find the best places to eat and drink. I saw a segment on Australian TV show, Getaway, about the Tour and it intrigued me so I booked. I was really happy with the way the tour was run and the food and wine I got to experience. David really knows his way around Buenos Aires and the local connections he has made with restaurateurs is very impressive. I would recommend this tour to couples, singles or foodies in general who are keen to try traditional food and meet new people."

Our group of 10 took the Palermo food tour with David and Santiago and came away very impressed with their local knowledge and very full from 4 great local food spots. Our tour included Choripan, Empanadas, a steak fest, gelato and wine. The spots that David and Santiago selected were definitely local spots off of the beaten path and places that we never would have found even with research. In fact the parilla (steakhouse) that we visited was a Secret local Parilla which was located in a nondescript gated building with absolutely no signage whatsoever. The food was amazing as were David and Santiago. I would highly recommend this tour for anyone traveling to BA!"

We started by meeting at a parrilla on Baez St around noon, had a briefing & met the other participants. A local was sitting behind me eating a steak; the steak was twice as big as any steak I have ever had in a restaurant. IMPRESSIVE beginning. Here we had a chorizo sausage \"hot dog style\" with 2 different sauces.Then we walked a block or so to a' take out empanada shop\". We stood on the sidewalk and had the best empanada I have ever.Then we walked to the \"secret parrilla\" where we had a nice salad, one of those grilled cheese disk things (OPA.....), and a big, great piece of steak, wine, another big platter of steak, more wine. My wife doesn't eat red meat and had a platter of fish for a family of 4. WOW.Finally a walk to a gelato shop.T can't understand how Argentinians can eat like this and look as slim as they do. We had 2 similar steak based \"lunches\" touring wineries in Mendoza.Argentina has the best tastiest tenderist steaks I have ever eaten, and that includes Ruth's Chris in New Orleans on Veteran's Blvd."

Starting at a famous old panaderia for empanadas, we moved on for a quick tour of the iconic San Temlo markets with a visit to a \"hole in the wall\" grill for chori-pan ( you would never think to stop there, to your loss - we went back on our own ! ). Main meal at a truly old school parrilla, one of the oldest in San Temlo with stories to tell. Final stop at artesanal ice cream cafe, Buenos Aires is THE place for icecream lovers ! I particularly recommend this tour if you have limited time in Buenos Aires as it condenses some of the key culinary experiences to have into a few hours, and provides a great snapshot of the true San Temlo."

It was also great to get to know the other guests - we had a British couple and a few different American families on our particular tour. We started out with choripan (which I loaded up with the spicy pepper sauce - so good!). Then it was off to the empanada spot, which was stuffed with beef. After, we sat down to a delicious steak lunch at one of the closed door spots that won't let you in unless they know you're coming. We started out with proveleta - a grilled provolone topped with spices. Cheese lovers will not be disappointed. Next, it was on to all the meats! There was the matambre (thin pork you squeeze lemon on), a prime rib-like cut, and a skirt steak (my personal favorite). We washed it down with some Malbec, which was delicious. Last, we had ice cream (dulce de leche of course). Needless to say, you should go hungry! It would be a great idea if you're coming on one of the flights that land super early in BsAs and you want to do something lowkey but still see the city on your first day.

Without Santi and David we could never get in to this phenomenal restaurant. Entry is reserved for locals and people known to the owner. It would be a shame t come to Buenos Aires and miss this place. This alone was worth the tour. We learned new things and tasted different styles of the local fare.

We did the tour on our 2nd day, and are so glad we did it early on. Santiago explained all the details of parilla culture, the food and wine of Argentina, and helped us plan our dining in Buenos Aires to maximize our stay. The highlight though were the spots he took us to. Here's a quick run-through of them:1) We met at an awesome little corner parrilla for choripan, their version of a hot dog, but way better. It was homemade and paired with my now favorite condiment, chimichurri!2) After walking 3-4 blocks we ate a fresh hot out of the oven steak empanada. This placed used chopped steak, not ground beef like we had at other spots. 3) Obviously Argentina is famous for steak and the main stop did not disappoint. It was a parilla steakhouse. It was so local and authentic. The entire staff greeted us with hugs and kisses upon entering! The steak was outstanding. Very flavorful and tender. All this was paired with the best wine we tasted in Argentina. The food and wine kept coming! 4) The finale was ice cream at a little ice cream shop. A little more modern than the other stops, but probably the best ice cream either of us had ever eaten. You could see them making the ice cream fresh. Overall a great way to start a trip through Argentina. Well worth the time and cost. "

If you're looking for an authentic walking tour within the Palermo's Las Canitas area this is the tour for you. It's lead by David, one of the Co Founders of Parrilla Tour Beunos Aires who is great. He's very well informed of the authentic local cuisines as well as information about the local area. He's an American living and loving Buenos Aires so he has great energy and passion for the city he shares with the guests. The tour starts with a visit to a Classis Carrilla (an authentic local restaurant) where you taste DELICIOUS Choripan (essentially Chorizo on Bread with delicious flavorful sauces). You then you visit an Empanadas Shop, another delicious stop with moist tasty empanadas and for lunch you dine at a \"Secret\" Parrilla. Be sure to save room for the grand finale, Heladeria ice cream stop. It's delicious tastes almost like Gelato which makes sense since there are a ton of Italian immigrants in Argentina. We were told the ice cream is something brought over from Italy hence the amazing Gelato like taste.I hope you enjoy the tour as much as I did. Thanks again David and Parrilla Tour for the great afternoon of dining, great company and a fun walking tour."

The weather had been so hot that this store lost their electricity and so there were no empanadas there. Our adorable guides said not to worry, they would make sure we had empanadas at our next stop. Sure enough the empanadas were the first course at a secret, sit-down restaurant. This restaurant was air conditioned so we relaxed with empanadas, wine and then the main meal, salad, two kinds of steak. All was good.

I only realized that he has a food tour after I read his blog and I was the one who initiated to ask about his food tour! Of course he was very welcoming for us to join him!I decided to take his tour simply because I believed that he could bring us to the local gems where they would not be easy to find if you are not the local. We took his dinner tour at Palermo. We tried 4 different dishes: Choripan, Empanadas, Secret Parrilla and ice-cream. The highlight for us was the secret Parrilla, you would never get to eat at the \"Secret Parrilla\" unless you are a local and you must know where they are, they change their name every 3 months! It's really interesting! During the tour, David, Santiago and Mariano were explaining well about all the food and the local culture! They are simply knowledgable! We were very satisfied with the good food. David was very nice as he continued to email me where and what to do in BA even after we had done the food tour! This Parrilla food tour is definitely one of the to-do list if you are on holidays in Buenos Aires!"

The hosts did really well and took us through lots of very locals style establishments from having a choripan in a 200 year old corner bar that used to be a dairy farm, to eating a empanada in the street to a very fine Parilla restaurant where everything looked shut but if you know the code they'll let you in. Al very good stuff I have to say. A bide de chorizo some pork matambre and some entrana served with a salad and some spicy chimmichurri sauce, surely one of Argentina's greatest gifts to the world. Recommend."

Our guide was really nice, and the sampling of places we visited gave us a nice introduction to Argentinian Food. Our guide also provided us with a nice booklet of restaurants to visit (though we had already gotten similar things from other tours / doing our own research). We had a choripan (sausage on a bun) in one restaurant, then walked to an empanada place for another snack. The empanada was quite good - we thoroughly enjoyed that. We had our actual lunch at a 'secret' parrilla (we won't spoil the secret or the details), but apparently it's out of the radar of BA 'foodies'. While the meal was nice and quaint, and the restaurant owners were quite welcoming, the actual steak was only okay. We had much better steak elsewhere. We ended up at a gelateria for dessert. It was nice, but also, nothing too out of the ordinary. Out of the entire experience, the empanada was the best part. To note, we went to a couple of puerta cerradas prior to this tour, and we felt that relative to what we got in those experiences, this tour was relatively more expensive, and not quite as delicious. All in all, it's a nice introduction to Argentinian food, but in all honesty, we had better experiences elsewhere. The value for us just wasn't there."

We started at a parrilla with some delicious choripan, a large local sausage with all the condiments, walked on a few blocks to have the best empanada I've tasted, then on to a \"secret\" parrilla where you can only get in if you know the owners. There we had a meal of the typical beef, made right in front of us on their open oven, with all the sides, wine and drinks included. There were 5 of us that day from the US, UK, and Australia. I asked for white wine and they graciously complied. It was delicious and a very filling meal. We then went on to a wonderful gelato place with every flavor imaginable ( at least 8 Different Dulce de Leche varieties alone!

Since it is such a personalized tour, I felt welcomed by our host, David, and was very comfortable even though I was by myself. David was so knowledgeable about the food and wine of Argentina that I would recommend booking this tour early on in your trip so that you can use some of his restaurant recommendations. All of the food was great from the empanadas to the ice cream. After our first stop (where we had tasty empanadas), we walked through an outdoor market in San Telmo where fresh meats, fruits, and other local wares were for sale. At a small food stand, we ate homemade choripan which is a sausage served on outstanding grilled bread. The menu for the day was written on paper, and the owner, a retired accountant, does this as a hobby. David told me that if he doesn't want to open for the day, he doesn't. What a special treat. The local restaurant where we had steak, was the best that I had while in Argentina; much better than the touristy parillas. The flavor of the beef was outstanding and enhanced by the wonderful chimichurri sauce. Their version of grilled cheese wasn't even close to what we have in the United States; it was so creamy and crunchy. The salad was so fresh and, of course, there was a great bottle of wine. The tour ended with dessert at a local ice cream shop. What a way to end such a flavorful experience. The sights, sounds, and smells were intoxicating. David always asked if we had any questions after he shared such great information on the history of food and wine in Argentina. Since I had about 10 blocks to walk to catch the subway back to my hotel, I asked David which direction I should go. He told me of a more scenic route to take than the one I took to get to the food tour. It was great advice as I saw some awesome sights on the way. Also, he was always good about taking my picture in each place we visited."

The locals were only eating meat and did not have the small cups of arugula that we were served. The skirt steak was quite a bit more tender that what we are used to in the US. The Argentine steak is grass-fed, so it is surprising that it is as tender as US prime (corn fed). The tour ended with ice cream at an adorable longstanding shop run by a grandmother. We learned that ice cream was brought to Argentina by the Italian immigrants.We really enjoyed learning more about Argentina and the food from our guides. We also enjoyed meeting the other tourists.

We felt so welcome and looked after and just enjoyed wandering around the gorgeous streets in the beautiful sunshine learning about the food. A relaxed and fun few hours, thanks guys!"

What I enjoyed most was the laid back vibe. It didn't feel over or underdone which meant everyone relaxed, chatted and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We actually had to reschedule at the last minute because my husband was getting over a stomach bug and it was absolutely effortless. David and Santiago clearly know the city and choose their spots with care. They took us to a 'Secret Parilla' that was not open to the public. The steak was better than what we had at the nicest restaurant in Mendoza. All around a great experience and value for the money. Don't miss this."

Food is such a vital part of cultures that we wanted to make sure to go to traditional restaurants, know how to properly order dishes and learn what is typical in the country. So after quickly dropping off our bags at our hotel we headed to San Telmo for our food adventure. The meeting point was in a pizza and empanada spot a few blocks from the main street for some tasty empanadas. Next we took a look at the San Telmo market, followed by a chorizo sandwich, which was my favorite part of the tour. Next we walked a few more blocks to a \"parrilla\" steakhouse for two types of steak, grilled provolone cheese and a nice malbec wine. We finished up at the cutest ice cream shop."

Greeted by a friendly guide, given a quick tour on the way to the old market side of town and then straight into the food. First was one of the oldest and best empanadas in Buenos Aires; delicious! Next was a restaurant just a short walk down the road where we were treated to a feast of bread, chimichurri, chorizo, delicious vegetables and, of course, amazing steak! Such good food, very filling and complemented by bulk delicious wine and the chance to write on the restaurant's walls as all good tourists. We had a vegetarian with us who even enjoyed his vegetarian option, but he definitely missed the best steak I'd had before. Lastly, we topped off the night with a couple scoops of awesome ice cream just down the road. I had cerveza (beer) flavour and lost my mind.It was definitely food heaven and the English speaking guide was friendly, knowledgeable and definitely made sure we had a great night. If you're lucky and a small group, you may even be taken to some local bars afterwards to continue the party... Strongly recommend!"

Everyone was very friendly and was a nice way to enjoy great food in a laid back atmosphere. On our tour we started visited 3 restaurants and one ice cream shop at the end. The food and wine was great and David and his team were very knowledgeable about the area's food and wine. I concur with other reviewers who gave this tour 5* and I would recommend it to anyone, especially on your 1st day in BA since it gives you a good overview of local food so you can try other restaurants later that have the things you liked best from the tour.I noticed a couple of recent reviews had criticism for the tour which I'd like to address (check my profile, I travel quite a bit...). Regarding price of tour relative to cost of food...of course you didn't eat $69 of food of the tour...but there was more than enough for a good lunch and you're paying for a professional tour...given the caliber of David and his staff along with the great food $69 is a very fair price to pay. The 2nd criticism that I saw from another poster was the the restaurants weren't really \"secret\" since we now know where they are...that is totally not the point. The places you visit on the tour are out in the open but there is no way I (or 99% of anyone else reading these would even find, let alone walk in and try one of these places without an expert recommendation). So again, you're paying for the expertise that David and his team did a super job providing."

We also tried two condiments that are commonly served with grilled meats: a gusty parsley-garlic sauce called chimichury and a robust relish called salsa criolla that combines tomatoes, oregano, onions and peppers.We really loved it!"

            "review": "Must have been an \"off day\". After reading all the prior reviews, my husband and I decided that this tour was a MUST DO while visiting Buenos Aires. We were so disappointed not only in the food but also in the fact that our guide, who was very sweet and a pleasure to spend time with was originally from Massachusetts and had only been in Buenos Aires for a year. Not exactly what one would expect when you book a tour to get a \"genuine taste of Argentina.\" Our first stop was a small restaurant where we met and waited for one other guest to arrive. We were the only customers there and we were served pan con chorizo. It was very good and our guide explained that this was to Argentinians what the hot dog is to Americans. This was swerved with seltzer water and our guide explained how the wine in Argentina was not very good in the past and how they would mix it with high pressured seltzer water to make it more palatable. Interesting tidbit of information as now the Argentinian wines are very good. After 15 minutes, we were off to walk a few blocks in the Palermo district to a second location where we waited outside on the street and our guide entered to get a few empanadas that, while good, were very hot and we were standing on the street corner eating them with a napkin. This to me is not really what I would consider a great way of enjoying this food even though I understand that this is considered a street food. Gobbled that down and we were on our way to the next destination which was very interesting. We walk a few blocks and come upon a store front that with metal railings that appears to be closed and actually has a closed sign on the outside. Our guide rang the bell, the door opened and we were welcomed in. The name of this Parrilla is \"Secret Parrilla.\" We were told that nobody knows about it (except EVERY tourist taking this tour) and they wanted to keep it that way as only a place for locals. Hummmm....sounded a bit strange to me. Either way, it was busy with what appeared to be locals and of course the tourists on the Parrilla Tour. Not quite buying this one. Our table had been set with a fresh salad and bread and we were served grilled cheese which was delicious accompanied by a Malbec wine. We were then served a steak which my husband said was very tough and solomillo (pork) which was inedible as we could barely cut it. I did request chicken since I don't eat red meat and that was good. The sausages were apparently pretty tasty as well. I did notice that our guide only ate salad and a small serving of cheese but I'll just assume that if she does this several times a week, this type of eating could get pretty old, especially from a very thin girl from Massachusetts. Next stop was an ice cream shop for gelato. We arrived and their computers were not working so we went a few more blocks to another shop of the same chain and were given our choice of 2 flavors of gelato. This I didn't understand AT ALL because gelato can be found ANYWHERE, especially if it's coming from a chain of shops. With all the wonderful pastries and desserts and the abundance of dulce de leche that is found in almost every dessert in Argentina, why would you choose to have ice cream as a dessert instead of a traditional Argentinian dessert?Realizing that there is absolutely NO overhead for this tour, I found it extremely overpriced for the quality of the food and the fact that you are taken to a \"secret parrilla\" that is for the tourists does not exactly give me the feeling of very authentic Argentinian experience. We found it a waste of an afternoon and a waste of an opportunity to have a great meal in Argentina where there are so many amazing restaurants. Would definitely skip this one, use the money for a great meal in ONE nice restaurant!"

There was quite a bit of confusion at the beginning as the owner of the first location seemed as if she wasn't expecting us or a tour and our tour guide was not yet there.We began with a stop for empanadas, then walked a few blocks to a local parrilla where we had choripan as well as provoleta and steak accompanied by malbec. Our last stop was an absolutely fantastic artesanal ice cream shop - by far the best part of the tour... it was absolutely delicious! I was anticipating a bit more of a selection or at least smaller portions with more things to try. To me this seemed more like a progressive lunch than a parrilla tour per se, as we only actually visited one parrilla.Our tour guide, Sabrina, was so friendly and helpful! I think that the best part of this tour was being introduced to restaurants that I would absolutely not go into otherwise, simply from the outside appearance. The food was delicious, but we could have done with more info about parrillas and/or more stops. I think that this could be good for people who have not yet been exposed to BsAs parrilla culture and want a good introduction.Overall, an excellent concept but ultimately an expensive lunch for what you get (you could get a similar lunch for $15US or less if you went on your own). May be a different experience with more people (there were only 4 of us)!"

This tour was absolutely clutch in the fact that it showed me what high quality argentine food is all about. I now have a benchmark to relate to, as this selection was clearly top-notch. Choripan, empanadas, provoleta, morcilla, bife de lomo and entra\u00f1a were all washed down with copious amount of high quality Malbec. A plethora of gelato flavors to choose from topped it all off!

Whether you are just passing through BsAs or living here for an extended period of time, you won't be disappointed with Parrilla Tour Buenos Aires!"

They offered both midday and dinnertime tours and we chose dinner since it worked better with our schedule. We met at the first restaurant where our guide for the evening, a young woman originally from the United States, was waiting for us and the other guests with a glass of malbec and a kind of local sausage sandwich. Next we walked to a \"casa di empanadas\" where we ate one of these local street treats. The main stop was a parilla restaurant which was very old-school was a temple to meat! We had a couple cuts of steak and pork, salad, grilled cheese and more malbec. Finally we finished up at an artisanal ice cream shop for some dulce de leche ice cream. Overall it was a delicious and entertaining night. All ages enjoyed it and are already planning on a doing a food tour on our next family trip."

It turned out to be an extremely rushed walking tour where you get to \"sample\" a few different things. I was expecting more of a \"dining experience\" and wine tasting. The main meal consisted of a rushed 15 minute meal at a local restaurant. I thought this was way too rushed and hectic. Overall this was not what I expected and I think it was overpriced for what it was. You might be better off exploring on your own."

The empanadas, the sausage sandwiches, steaks, pork, blood sausage, wine and more. And to top it all off....ICE CREAM and espresso. The best ever, no lie.

The tour itself was a great initial plunge into local culture. All of the parillas we visited were filled with locals allowing us to better understand porteno life. This is a 5 star tour.

My husband and I did both the Palermo and San Telmo Parrilla Tours and thoroughly enjoyed both tours. The Palermo tour was our favorite for a couple of reasons being: you visit 4 places (rather than 3 on the San Telmo tour); we had a larger group on our Palermo tour so the atmosphere was more enjoyable; and the \u2018Secret\u2019 Parrilla place in Palermo has amazing meat! The pork in particular was amazing! The \u2018Secret\u2019 Parrilla place is for neighbourhood locals only; they can only bring tours here because (as I recall) one of the Parilla Tour business partners is from the neighbourhood, and even then it took a lot of negotiation. They even change their name every couple of weeks as they don\u2019t want to be known on Trip Advisor. Why? Because they are packed everyday just from patronage from the neighbourhood locals! On both days our guide was David. We appreciated all of the tips he gave us in respect to bars etc. Thanks to David we discovered the Buenos Aires Time Out Magazine \u2013 great resource for planning your stay. We would definitely recommend doing one of the Parrilla Tours during your stay in Buenos Aires."

My family of 6 (my wife and I, plus my parents and two twenty-something brothers) met up with David our tour guide and the rest of our group, which I was pleasantly surprised to find out were residents of BA who had taken off during the middle of their work day to endulge in the tour. This made for some great conversation to complement the truly tasteful choice of eateries we visited during the tour, which included an old-school amazing Parilla (classic BA steak restaurant), a phenomenal hole-in-the wall empanada joint (some of the best we had during our entire trip), a sit-down lunch at a \"closed door\" Parilla where locals-only dined beside us at reserved tables (yes reserved for lunch - they take their steak seriously people!) in a charming Parilla which you would never find nor be able to gain entry in without this tour (literally there is a sign saying closed outside the unassuming unmarked door), just amazing! David even went out of his way to accommodate my wife who is a vegetarian by ordering for her at the restaurants, as well as providing us with amazing restaurant, bar and shopping recommendations for the rest of our BA tour. Cap the tour off with a dulce de leche and there you have it. We can't say enough about this tour and havent stopped talking about it since we've returned home. Do yourself a favor and make sure to put this on your must-do list while in Buenos Aires, you can thank me later ;)"

I would VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tour to anyone who is interested in good food and wine. I believe, and I suspect many people as well, that the best way to visit a city is to inform and enjoy yourself to the local food scene. This is tour is especially excellent for anyone traveling a few weeks or even a few days because they can recommend a host of other great recommendations outside of the food tour. Essentially it is a perfect way to meet good company and orient yourself to the quality food scene in Buenos Aires. Also I researched their competition - Buenos Aires food tours - and was underwhelmed by the comments/recommendations and experiences they had to offer. Parrilla Tour is the way to go.

In addition to the delicious food, I learned so much from David about the history of the country and culture and about the local traditions.

This is such a unique way to experience a city I am surprised that no one has done it before now! David then went above and beyond the call of duty. We had casually mentioned during lunch that we had dinner reservations at Il Latino, a top restaurant in B.A. When we arrived that evening the owners of the restaurant informed us that David has called ahead to let them know we were coming and had asked them to take special care of us (which they did).

The adventure started by trying a couple of typical streetfoods, but artisanal versions. The main stop was a parrilla that was hidden and for locals only. That was a highlight of our stay in the city. Finally we finished up at an ice cream shop where we ate the best ice cream I have ever had."

I have never done a review on this website before, only read other people\u00b4s, but we had such an enjoyable experience on the Parrilla Tour that I felt motivated to do a review! Our guide, Aylen, made the afternoon a uniquely local experience. All of the restaurants she had chosen for us had excellent food, but more than that the ambiance was incredible, filled with people from the neighborhood. We learned more about the city and country in just a couple hours than we ever could have from guidebooks."

Our concierge at the Sofitel told us about this tour and that it was in his opinion the best way to try the food of Buenos Aires and that the steakhouses were places he went with his friends, and not tourist traps. We booked a private dinner tour in San Telmo that lasted about 3 hours. Our guides were Santiago and Lucia, both locals. The restaurants were not in the least bit fancy, but the ambiance felt so authentic and traditional! Food was all outstanding, and the bife de chorizo steak was far better than the high end parrilla we visted the following night."

It was great because we got to eat at multiple restaurants during the tour and learned a lot about Argentine cuisine. 1) Stop 1 was where we met. It was a 200 year old building where they made amazing chorizo sandwiches and sauces to go with them. 2) Next we walked a few blocks to a small corner restaurant for a piping hot empanada straight from the oven. It was the best empanada we had in Argentina. 3) After that we walked a couple more blocks to another steakhouse where we sat down and had several foods including provolata cheese, 2 cuts of meat, a really nice malbec wine and salad. Very authentic restaurant filled with all locals besides us. 4) Finally we finished up at a wonderful ice cream shop. Flavors changed daily and made on site. All in all a very good food tour. Would recommend it if you are coming to Buenos Aires!"

My family just finished a 3 week trip around Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil and went on the Parrilla Tour during our time in Buenos Aires. We were attracted to this tour because their website said they took their groups to small local restaurants you do not read about in guidebooks. When we travel we try to blend in with the locals and eating where they do is a good bet for finding great food! We showed up at first restaurant and were warmly greeted by the co-founders David and Santiago. In total we visited 4 restaurants, including 2 separate steakhouses. All of the food was outstanding, we drank wonderful wine, met some great people, and learned so much about Argentine cuisine and culture. The tour was without question one of the highlights of our trip, and we've already recommended it to some friends heading to Argentina later this year."

David and Santiago ran an interesting tour which took us to a few very good restaurants with great food. We enjoyed a choripan (chorizo sandwich) to start, then an empanada, then a stop at a parrilla to enjoy a few appetizers and salad, as well as delicious steak and red wine. The final stop was for gelato, which was a delight. Our tour of ten was a mixed international group of friendly and gregarious people.

The places visited were not in the least bit trendy or fancy, but places that people from the neighborhood ate. The real value for us though was the guide and their extensive knowledge of the city. Outside of learning about their food, they answered everything from questions about politics to the economy, to cultural traditions. It did not feel at all like a traditional organized tour, more like a wonderful lunch with new friends. Best of luck Parrilla Tour!"

The steak we had at the 3rd stop was one of the best things I have ever eaten and the ambiance made me feel like a local. Great food, people, and wine! Thanks for all the tips guys!"

Our guide, a young woman named Belen, took us to 4 different stops where we tried foods traditional in Argentina. All of the tour stops were where local porteno people frequent. Not places that put focus on trying to be trendy, but food family run restaurants. A huge bonus of our tour was the guide. She was prepared and was so friendly and welcoming. At the end she was happy to get a cab for us as well as call and make a dinner reservation for the next night a restaurant in San Telmo that was our favorite meal of the trip."

My favorite foods on the tour were the chorizo sandwich with chimichurri sauce and the ice cream at the final stop. Besides the food, a huge value of the tour was everything we learned from our guides. They were happy to answer our endless questions about Argentina."

I was happily surprised and had a great afternoon with the two founders of the company, Dave and Santi. In total we were 8 people, a nice sized group since I got to meet some interesting people, but not so large that you felt like you were on one of those obnoxious tour groups. I was told 8 was the average group size. We visited 4 different little restaurants and tried a food at each and an outstanding malbec wine at the main stop. All of the places we visted were ultra local and you could tell the owners of each were passionate about making their foods. At the end of the day I walked away knowing all about Argentine food and culture as well as had a nice relaxing afternoon. I don\u00b4t like tours, but I recommend this tour!"

We were lucky enough to have both David and Santiago turn up and, as I and my wife were the only guests that night, have them to ourselves to boot, so we felt more like having new friends show us around the neighbourhood than being on a tour. We met up at a place that serves brilliant choripan, went to another for wonderful empanadas, then had provoleta, sirloin and pork flank at a place where apparently you had to be known to be admitted. David and Santiago had brought a very nice Malbec especially to accompany the meat. We finished with ice cream at a fourth place. The food and wine were excellent, the places were ones you probably wouldn't find on your own, and our hosts were informative and good company. We recommend checking it out, but bear in mind that the tour is also relatively expensive and, depending on what you're looking for, you might not find it good value for money."

We basically went to one place for empanadas, another for what I'll call the \"dinner\" which featured 3 courses we tried, and then an ice cream place for dessert (Try the cerveza ice cream! I know it sounds scary and possibly gross but it's really good! haha). Our guide, Sabrina, did a great job and she was attentive for our diverse group. Given the layout of the tour, I only wish we had had a chance for more dishes, perhaps even pastries specific to the area or more styles of meat (i.e. flank steak, tenderloin, etc.). But I still definitely recommend if you get a chance to visit San Telmo. The neighborhood is just perfect for this type of tour!"

We then proceeded down the road to have some hot home made empanadas while walking to our main meal. The restaurant was closed, with a big Cerrado sign across the door, but the doors miraculously opened just for Sabrina- and us. They don't much like tourists there. The Provoleta - grilled whole provolone cheese - was rich and flavorful. The arugula salad with parmigian was nice too. The Malbec was good, and so was the bife de chorizo, even though they don't do rare in Argentina and the meat was ok but a bit tough. Excellent gelato to finish and all in all a very nice tour though not great value for the money."

But once inside, we met the owners of the restaurant and we fell in love with not only the food, but the atmosphere.

We enjoyed dinner as we received an explanation of the area and origins of the food, wine and the local neighborhood. The experience was capped off at a local ice cream store. Again, great tasting and great atmosphere. I would thoroughly recommend the Parrilla Tour to those who really want to experience authentic Argentina, not just the tourist traps!

The chorizopan sandwich was outstanding, steak was cooked perfectly and so flavorful, and the ice cream was hands down the best either of us had eaten in our lives (and my wife is Italian!). So good that we came back another night since we had to have the ice cream again! The guides Santiago and David were fantastic and prepared us for the rest of our Argentina trip. Thanks for recommending Salon Canning to us!"

The empanads were hot and eaten outside the bakery. The choripan sandwich - was eaten in a traditional cafe that had once been a dairy. Buenos Aires is quirky in that many restaurants are only for the locals. The guide took us to one of the \"private restaurants\", the parrilla where we indulged ourselves with meat and Malbec wine. The meat was so tender and the fried cheese was also good. To complete our meal we walked to an ice cream parlor and enjoyed great ice cream."

We took the San Telmo tour the day we arrived in Buenos Aires after a 2-week cruise. The list of restuarants in the city was somewhat daunting and we wanted to have a feel for what we were in for by someone who lived there. David, an ex-pat from Oregon, and one of the individuals who runs Parilla Tours, was our guide, and we could not have been happier with our choice. He was freindly, polite, outgoing and eager to please, as was his young associate, wanting to ensure that everyone had a great time and enjoyed the wonderful food that his tour and Buenos Aires offers. We made three stops - first, in a little hole in the wall-type place for some incredible empanadas. Then, in a parilla for some great choripan (something I'm now addicted to) and some first rate steak and nice Malbec to accompany it. The final stop was an old-fashioned gelato place where we had the creamiest ice cream on the planet. I had some questions about where to go for dinner during my stay and David gave me some great tips about a parilla, which I went to twice before I left. I encourage anyone going to Buenos Aires to take this tour (on an empty stomach) and be prepared for a relaxed, funfilled and hearty time!"

Lucky for me, David took care of everything - empanadas to start and all sorts of Argentine staples to follow. We had fresh bread, spreads, hot cheese, arugula salad, choripans, steaks, sauces and dessert too. I even had 2-3 glasses of malbec with my lunch and just wanted to roll home. Great deal for the price. Plus, truly local vibe at the different spots and a mixed crew of fellow carnivores rounded it all out. Definitely recommend!"

We had close to 20 that participated but that just meant we were able to interact with young people from other countries. The choripan was a sausage on fresh bread. Slightly spicy with Chimmichurri sauce used for grilled meat The 2nd course was a meat empanada that was the best I have had since I arrived. The 3rd course was Bife de Chorizo with a salad plus bread but was started with Melted provolone cheese, topped with oregano. Steak was juicy and tender.

Great guide (David), wonderful food, and such a nice difference to have a course at each stop, which also gave us the chance to walk and see the district we were in. Oh, and to actually get IN to the Secret Parrilla was a real highlight! I did also swipe a menu of flavours from the ice-cream store, in the hope that my 'local' ice-cream store might make some Dulce de Letche for me. I would give these lads a big thumbs up and well done, and would suggest that anyone considering this tour has a very light breakfast, as you will be very well taken care of at lunch time."

David was a nice guy and really did a good job including local histories and stories related to the places we visited, the food we ate and the neighborhood we walked through. I would recommend going hungry because the food on the tour is plentiful and delicious. The first stop (and meeting place) almost looks like a hole in the wall, but don't let that stop you. Here you have a choripan sandwich accompanied with local sauces, including chimichurri. The sandwich and sauces both were very good. The second stop is a local empanada shop. Again the restaurant isn't large and focuses mostly on take out, but the quality of the food was quite good. One of the best empanadas I had on my trip.The third stop is a secret parrilla - secret because without this tour, you would never know about it, much less find it. Here we were served salad, provoleta, steak (of course), pork loin and wine. All of the food again was quite tasty. After all that food, there is still one more stop - and you want to make sure you save room for it - the Ice cream shop! Here you receive a cup with 2 scoops of any ice cream you want - and there are lots to chose from. My husband and I each got 2 different flavors, giving us the opportunity to try 4 different ones - all were excellent! The tour lasts between 2 or 3 hours. There is walking involved, maybe 3 or 4 blocks between each restaurant, so wear comfortable shoes and clothes. I would definitely recommend the tour for anyone wanting a well rounded view of the Buenos Aires food scene."

The tour lives up to its promise of delivering an authentic experience - the restaurants are all off the beaten tourist path.

Two guys, David, an American, and the other, Santiago, an Argentine, run the tour, We met at a little hole in the wall parilla in Canitas neighborhood, near Palermo, where the best chorizopan (sausage sandwich) I have had to date was to be found, with all sorts of great sauces, my favorite being a sort of vinaigrette with all sorts of spices. Next stop, several blocks away, was for meat empanadas, in yet another little shop that only locals would notice. Then the main course was at TitoSecret, a very small place where it's reservations only and the sign on the door says \"closed\" to the general public. The slow grilled steak was so tender one could cut it with a dull knife. Salt the only flavoring. Oh YUM! (Only certain chocolate has given me a similar gastronomic high.) Finally we ended the tour at a gourmet heladeria (ice cream shop). Oh my, the ice cream beats anything I have had in the U.S. Both guys were amiable, and we had great conversations along the way,and I learn a bit about life in Buenos Aires. They even got me on the correct bus back to San Telmo where I'm staying. I highly recommend this ~3 hour tour as something different, esp. if one is a carnivore (Vegetarians need not apply). David and Santiago have scouted the neighborhood for the best typical local food. They have a parallel tour in San Telmo. I wish David and Santiago success in their venture."

I signed up for a tour on Saturday afternoon and then got an e-mail from one of the owners saying that I was the only person signed up that day (since it was the slow season), but he was still more than willing to do the tour if I wanted. I said yes and he told me the parilla to meet at noon. We went to three places, eating a different dish at each. At the first place we had Choripan, which was amazing. The second place was empanadas and the third was steak. Then we went for ice cream. I learned a lot about Argentine food, it was delicious, and the tour guide was excellent.

The tour went to 4 different locations starting with choripan (pork sausage aka chorizo & bread) which is the classic way to start an asado. From there we ate local empanadas and explore the different preparations according to region. The third stop was a 'secret parrilla' which I thought was closed once we walked up. Once the doors opened we were surrounded with locals chowing down on their lunch break. Between the group we had wine, salad, two cuts of beef, pork, chimichurri, and water. More than the table could handle. The tour concluded at a small ice cream shop where coffee or ice cream was offered. Clearly I opted for the ice cream. Considering the amount you pay it's totally worth it just from the amount of food. An added bonus was walking to and from the locations, learning about the neighborhood as well as the local culinary traditions.

The lesson lasted a few hours and we go the basics down about how to ride a horse and steer it in different directions. He was a good instructor and we got plenty of practice. The horses also were pretty used to having guests ride them, so they were perfectly tame and responsive to my inexperienced directions. After basic lessons we learned the rules of the game and got to play a short match. It was a lot of fun and an experience I felt that was well worth the money.

Fernando even assisted us with details of a trustworthy and reliable private driver for our airport transfer the following day :)"

The reviews were excellent and everybody says amazing things about Fernando so we decided to try this place and meet the famous Fernando. Fernando picked us up from a central location in Buenos Aires near our hotel and we have a really nice chat with him on the way to the stables that are around 40 mins away from Buenos Aires. He gave us really good recommendations for restaurants and places to visit in Buenos Aires that we followed and loved. I went with my husband. I love horses, I do horse riding sometimes and attend to any Polo event that I can in the UK and my husband didn\u2019t have any experience playing Polo neither. We didn\u2019t know what to expect. We arrived to the stables and started riding the Polo ponies. Fernando is a great trainer and will find the perfect pony for you. The ponies are really sweet and perfectly trained so you will feel really safe. Once we felt comfortable riding the ponies Fernando taught us the basic techniques and rules of the Polo and we started to use the mallet and try to hit the balls. After a while practicing we took a break and we played 2 games: Spain (I) + Greece (my husband) VS Argentina (Fernando) and it was really Funnnnnn. This activity exceeded of our expectations and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to try to play some Polo near Buenos Aires. I wish I would be closer to be able to go often! It was my first time playing Polo and I enjoyed so much that I\u2019m already looking for clubs near London to play again. Thanks Fernando for a great day! You are a star!!"

Fernando quickly made me feel comfortable riding \"polo style\" with clear instruction and enthusiastic encouragement! We met at an easily accessible point in the city and enjoyed a comfortable transfer to the polo grounds, around 45 minutes outside of Buenos Ares. Whilst I have riding experience, the person with me did not, and Fernando was able to easily accommodate both of us. I highly recommend this experience. Great fun had by all!"

It was a great day trip. Relaxed pastoral setting, and a terrific way to get a glimpse of the countryside and the way of life. Fernando Nieto is a superb host, a wonderful guy, and has an encyclopedic knowledge of Argentine history and politics (as well as being an internationally ranked polo player). This was one of the highlights of our trip, and we would highly recommend it."

Fernando was fantastic - he picked a group of 5 of and drove us to the stables which are about 45 mins out of the city. Fortunately the weather was kind and stayed dry for the few hours we were there - can understand why heavy rain would make it very difficult to run the session. He made every effort to make our session great and was very patient. I haven't ridden for 5 years but it was easy to get into the swing of things. The ponies were fantastic too - they are well cared for and knew what to do (including kicking a few balls for us in the right direction!). We learnt the basics and had time for a game which was great fun - the other people on the trip were great too. Overall I loved every minute of this and would recommend it highly. A big thank you to Fernando, the team at the stables and the wonderful polo ponies!"

It was then that a colleague and I had the chance to meet Fernando Nieto, the owner, chief instructor and rated Argentine polo player. (Oh, he\u2019s also an economist and former professor, but that\u2019s another story.) I was really looking forward to spending time with Fernando again, because not only is he an interesting guy to talk with, but he\u2019s a great instructor. He is articulate and very patient. I have played polo before, but at 72 it had been a while. (Turns out eye-hand coordination may be the second thing to go.) We were joined by a young couple who had never ridden. It was great to watch Fernando get them comfortable on horseback and then introduce them to the basics of the game. After a break we even wrapped up with a little two-on-two competition. Polo Elite probably isn\u2019t unique in Argentina, but I can\u2019t think of many places in the world where you can get such a great introduction to the sport, on such good horses, for an affordable price. Recommended for all ages, even mine."

Air-conditioned, comfortable 45 minute return transfer from BA city to a farm near Canuelas with Fernando who was welcoming, friendly and chatty throughout.Lesson was great - professionally delivered, with enough freedom to practice new skills and support provided to improve. My boyfriend and I were beginners so received a helpful riding lesson first, as well as later learning about the game of polo and the skills needed to play. After the polo lessons we played a game, which was pretty exhilarating for beginners! Was also a great way to put to practice the skills you learn during the day.Fernando is a patient instructor, who also helps to make the day really fun. As mentioned above, we were so impressed, we asked Fernando the next morning for another booking just 3 days later. Although the day seems quite expensive, the experience is definitely worth the money and you won't find better value elsewhere - we would recommend this for anyone at any level. Particularly as polo is the number one sport in Argentina -- and, when in Rome!"

He was very understanding of our time limits and was able to show us the absolute best and most beautiful parts of the city. There are areas of the City that need to been seen. As an outsider, with a time limit, I would have never been able to find these places on my own. Funny enough, throughout the course of the day and our conversations, my friends and I discovered that he also ran a polo school about 45 mins outside of the city. The thought excited us, as we have never played polo before (most of us had never even ridden a horse). Moreover, the big guy I was with probably never able to find a horse he could ride. The adventure enticed us, and we signed up. The experience was amazing. One of the best of my life. Fernando was not only accommodating in picking us up from our hotel, but was a fantastic teacher as well. We played polo in Argentina! Not many people can say that. Even the big guy got to ride!Cheers and a 5 star rating for a special company and all around nice guy."

While Polo isn't easy I had a blast trying it out and I even wanted to do again.. so next time I'm in Buenos Aires I may just go do Polo again with Fernando.. Its a must do in Buenos Aires. Go Do it. He is great and you will have a blast."

I had heard great things about Fernando and Polo Elite from several of my friends who had lived here for a few years so I figured this would be a great chance to try it out. I cannot express how surprised I was by my experience. After 7 years this ranks among the best things I have ever done in this country, certainly in the Buenos Aires area. Fernando was so great during the entire arrangement. He picked us up in the city and drove us out to the range.Along the way he was pleasant and friendly with his conversation and helped explain a great deal about the game and the history in Argentina. None of us were very experienced with riding horses, with one of us having absolutely no experience whatsoever. But Fernando was excellent in his manner of teaching us how to ride and then teaching us the basics of the game. He was very kind and patient and explained things very clearly. We rode his personal horses and was trained using his equipment. After a few hours on the horses and riding lessons we started learning the polo-specific skills. After practicing those for a while we then played a real game with Fernando.After finishing he drove us back to the city and sent us on our way. The entire time we were there I was having fun. From riding the horses together with my family, to learning how to ride better, and then learning the super fun game of polo. All the while he was there to help us be safe and to keep us having fun. The best was actually playing the polo match and running up next to the other players and pushing them out of the way using my horse and stealing the ball. The excitement of feeling the horses push against each other and then fighting for the ball against my brother was one of the coolest and most refreshing things I have ever done. If anyone comes to BA for ever a weekend trip, I can say with all of my experience here as both a tourist and a local, (not some lazy expat living in bars and thinking they know the culture) that this is a MUST DO activity."

The experience was reasonably priced, a personalised service, offers a beautiful day in the countryside and the opportunity to gain an understanding of the nuances of Polo from Fernando, a passionate Polo player himself. Fernando picked us up from our Apartment in BA and we drove an 1hr into the BA countryside to Pilar. Fernando drove around some of the surrounding stables and shared his wealth of knowledge about some of the history and colour of Polo. Being from Australia, of particular interest was the stables of Ellerstina, with the Packer connection. We came to a driveway of crunchy white gravel lined with pointing polar trees and shady oaks and there before us stood a fairytale castle nestled back from lines of polo fields. This was the Argentina Polo Association and I had arrived at the very heart of the Polo World. I had a wonderful afternoon learning from Fernando about the game, the rules and how its played and watching magnificent horses thunder up and down the perfect Polo fields, snorting loudly from pure exhaustion, it was really quite exhilarating. I was fortunate to have timed my visit to coincide with the Hurlingham Open and we watched Ellerstina defeat Chapaleufu. Four of the top ranked Polo players in the world were playing in this match. I loved my day at the Polo and I was thrilled by the power of the horses and the love of the sport that was all around you. Fernando made the day. He is wonderful and generously shares his extensive knowledge of the sport. I don't think a trip to Argentina would be complete without a trip to Polo with Fernando."

Not only is Polo extremely fun as a sport but Fernando is an excellent teacher. To the reviews that say there is not enough instruction I could not disagree more. Fernando helped me hold the reins, speed up my horse, use a mallet, and eventually use proper defensive technique. Also, remember this is one man teaching 8 people to play a completely foreign sport, riding on the backs of half ton animals, in a 3 acre field. It makes what Fernando does in teaching and managing the group that much more impressive. The rest of the staff at the ranch were very friendly and the horses (some of which are actual polo competitors) had good temperaments dealing with a bunch of amateurs. Super smart animals. Our match was a blast and I'm considering going a second time on my stay just to play more. It's worth every cent. As an irrelevant aside, I also enjoyed playing with the many dogs on the ranch."

After a while he gave us the mallets, so we actually had to hit the ball. Practise is everything and it\u00b4s a great feeling to hit the ball so that it flies away! The horses are well trained and you feel that they get excited by game and the sound of the mallet hitting the ball.

It is a half-day excursion in which most of your time is spent on horseback, learning to play polo.We were picked up from central BA, and drove with Fernando out to a farm in a semi-rural area. We were well equipped with ponies, helmets, mallets, and plenty of balls to hit around the training field. We started with a few laps of the field to warm the ponies up, then gradually learned new skills, with time to practice each before moving on to the next. Fernando expained each skill thoroughly, and was patient and encouraging as he helped us practice. After a break we were ready to play a mock game of polo, Australia vs. Argentina, which Fernando graciously allowed us to win. He took plenty of action shots, which he sent to us later.As an aside, we enjoyed the antics of the animals on the farm: the tiny pony which escaped its paddock and defied efforts to recapture it, and the numerous dogs, who leapt all over Fernando when we arrived, and who seem to spend most of their day chasing a cheeky plover."

It was forecast to rain on our scheduled date, so Fernando emailed me several days ahead of time to change the date. Communication was very clear all the way through, and we had an amazing time when we got out to the farm. Fernando picked the four of us up at the meeting spot, and we drove about an hour into the country. Since we had very little experience riding horses, Fernando spent about an hour teaching us the basics of horseback riding before he gave us the mallets. We did a couple drills to get used to hitting the balls, and then we took a much needed break before we played a game of Polo. Great experience, great coaching, serious bang for the buck. Do it!"

As a bunch of unorganised, hungover Australians, I imagine we would have been frustrating to deal with! Fernando was the ultimate host. Heavy rain had meant we could not play on the regular field, but Fernando ensured we had a place to play, despite the ominous weather conditions. Everyone had a blast, and more importantly, we all returned safely and there were no broken limbs for the wedding photos. I'd encourage everyone to try this whilst in BA. It was great to see some of the countryside, and try a sport that's not very accessible here in Sydney. A few of the guys have since returned to spend more time playing polo with Fernando.It ended up being one of the highlights of the whole South American trip, highly recommended!!"

We were all beginners (i.e., none of us had ever played polo, and most of us had little to no experience in riding a horse). For a beginner, this is a perfect experience that exposes you to calm horses that are very easy to handle. For those that just want a picture on a horse, and the ability to ride around for a half hour, you can do that here. For those that want to play a game of polo with a faster pace, such game occurs after the initial calm instruction and walk around with the horses, so that is available as well. The instructors are nice, fun, and easy to talk to. Fernando is a phenomenally nice guy with a lot of positive energy to add to the day.I would highly recommend this event, especially for beginners and groups."

Fernando picked us up at our front door on time and drove us out to the polo farm. His English is great and we had wonderful conversations about Argentina and polo. We have three boys ages 11, 9 and 9 with very little horse riding experience. Fernando's horses were extremely gentle and calm. In fact very smart. They could sense if you were nervous or uncomfortable and would not go faster than a slow trot. After we got more comfortable and relaxed they began to run for us. Frankly, I never thought I could control a horse with one hand and swing a mallet with the other. By the end of the afternoon we played a match. My horse was amazing! He reacts to shifts in body weight and was very easy to control. Our 11 year old was a natural and was off galloping around the field. Our 9 year olds...not so much. Fernando and his helper split us up and spent extra time with the twins and they were playing polo (unassisted) by the end of the day. It was such fun! We always felt very safe and helmets are provided. After the polo match, the kids took turns galloping around the field without the mallet. Fernando was very accommodating and patient. The kids did not want it to end.For lunch Fernando drove us 5 minutes away to an amazing mansion built in 1919 for a 3 course meal. We ate on the porch and enjoyed the beautiful scenery. It was excellent! Fernando drove us back to Buenos Aires and dropped us off at our door. We had asked him about things to do including Tango lessons and attending a futbol game. He drove us by a place near us that gave Tango lessons. The next day he emailed me links to lessons and where to get futbol tickets. He also sent me all the other suggestions he gave us throughout the day. On top of that, he sent me 28 pictures that he had taken of the family during our day of polo. Fernando goes above and beyond. What a great host and a wonderful day! Contact Fernando, you will not be disappointed!"

He was incredibly patient with our group -- we had about 30 people with us, which he said was the biggest group he'd worked with so far. They picked us up from Palermo in a large van and a bus and took us to the polo field. We were split in 3 groups and each group was given 15 minutes or so to learn the basics of riding and warm up on the horses, and then given mallets to play around for another 20-30 minutes or so. I had done a bit of riding before so I was comfortable on the very tame horses they have. Fernando and the other coaches were super watchful and helpful with everyone. After, they provided a huge lunch for us all, and were helpful with some of our friends dietary needs, including vegetarian, which didn't seem super common everywhere we went in Argentina. After lunch, we were given the choice between going back out and playing a real \"match\" of polo, or going back home. About two thirds of the group went home, while those of us that stayed got to see Fernando and his mates play a real match for a bit, and then let us play a match against each other, which was much less intense (but still really fun)! They took our group home after we all played, even after taking an initial group back the hour-long journey. It was a wonderful time and we even had Fernando and another coach, Maxi, over to our house that evening for an asado and then a night out on the town.

Being a novice horse rider, I was a bit nervous about learning to play polo while atop a horse, so I ended up just riding the horse (with assistance from a groom) for a bit, sans the mallet. That said, I stayed on my horse 15 minutes longer than my friend, who only stayed on one minute. Funny really, because the horses are incredibly tame and well behaved. I think it was just more work than sitting on the grass and playing with all of Fernando's lovely dogs, while he taught the others to play. No complaints here. The countryside is lovely and the company was superb. After the lesson, Fernando took us to a watch him and some other professional polo players play a few matches at a private polo club down the road. There, we drank wine and picnic'd (it is encouraged to bring a picnic basket for your dinner) while handsome Argentinean men raced across the field, playing the very fast paced and exciting sport. We also played with more local dogs, my favorite being Lila, the polo club owners gorgeous and sweet baby girl. After that, Fernando offered to take us back to his estancia to try our hand at riding one more time. Our new Swiss friend (who is a fantastic rider) opted to do that, but we decided to stay at the polo club for wine and conversation with the owner and some of the polo players. An hour or so later, Fernando came to pick us up and took us back to the city. The sky out there in the country was the bluest I'd ever seen. The weather was perfect (which I imagine it usually is in Argentina, compared to rainy Oregon where we are from). The polo club was beautiful.

If you have any interest in polo or riding this is a definite must!Fernando, owner of Polo Elite, is a brilliant international polo player and a patient and full-of-fun teacher. Outside of Buesnos Aires and away from the hustle and bustle of the city this makes for a perfectly peaceful escape; the polo fields set in beautiful surroundings.The instruction was made fun but at the same time second to none - we were taught how to properly communicate and control the polo ponies, to swing the mallets in both forward and back-hand strokes, block a strike and to nudge a rider away from the ball... Once we'd practised and (to some degree!) mastered all of these things, and were given the basic rules and it was our turn to play a game... at a simple walk and trot at best, a slow paced beginners plod, it was enormous fun and a real buzz! Highly recommended!"

I own my own horse but my friends do not ride, Fernando was endlessly patient and ensured we each rode ponies suitable to our experience levels. We had a fantastic time, Fernando is a great teacher and very patient, his ponies are lovely. Would highly recommend this to everyone, riders and non riders alike, we all loved every minute of our afternoon and will certainly return if ever in Buenos Aires again. Thank you Fernando for a great day!"

We knew it was something that we couldn't do again so based on the reviews on TA we put our faith in polo elite and weren't disappointed. Fernando was amazing at teaching us to be capable enough riders and players, so at the end of our session we were able to play a mock polo game. The game itself is techniqual yet with Fernando's guidance we were all able to understand the rules and talent that it involves. If you don't have a fear of being on a horse and have a general interest in all sports, this is a must do!Anthony, 22 Melbourne Australia"

After originally hearing about the potential of having polo lessons through our hostel (which were endorsing another company due to kick backs) we were keen to check out the other options and were immediately drawn to this one due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews it had received on TA. We couldn't be happier with our decision to go with Fernando and Polo Elite.Being three beginner riders from suburban Australia who had maybe ridden ponies once or twice as kids, Fernando actually got the three of us up to the standard required to play a pretty competitive mock game of polo by the end of the sessions.As backpackers on a budget, an attraction like this is obviously a pretty expensive thing to partake in. But I can undoubtably claim amongst the incredible things we've seen and done, this experience was the highlight of our trip so far and absolutely worth every penny.When/ where else are we ever going to get an opportunity to get on a horse and play polo?! On top of that, Fernando was more than patient with any questions and difficulties we had with our lack of experience on horseback- and the the seasoned polo horses he has trained are unbelievable at coping with the pressure of dealing with inexperienced riders. Fernando was happy to take pictures of us on our cameras as well as his own throughout the session, and sent them on to us free of charge afterwards. We thought this was another added bonus we hadn't bargained on, as photos atop horseback playing polo really are priceless.If what you're looking for is a one of a kind experience at actually playing polo and getting great guidance from an awesome guide and teacher, this activity is for you."

What better place to learn than in Argentina, the home of the best players in the world!? Fernando speaks excellent English & is a fantastic teacher, so by the end of lesson we felt very comfortable hitting the ball and had a lot of fun playing the game. It certainly helped that the polo ponies knew exactly what they were doing & were of very good temperament.The private transfer from Central BA out to the stables and back gave us the opportunity to learn more about Argentina too, which was a big bonus.Overall, it was a very well organised, personable & fun experience and was one of the highlights of our whole trip. I would highly recommend a day out with Polo Elite to anyone visiting Buenos Aires, regardless of riding ability. Fernando's great guidance coupled with the wonderful polo ponies will provide you with an amazing experience that you will never forget!"

Before we began, Fernando set us up with his horses based on our experience levels. My friend has a horse, so she had no problems figuring out the game and her horse, but I am not very experienced in riding or with polo so I took time to ask questions and stroll around with my horse. We spent the first half hour getting use to riding and using the polo gear before beginning practice drills with the ball. By the end of our time, we had learned the basics of the game and played against each other (there were 8 people there) in a scrimmage. The experience is something I will always remember because it is so unique. I would say that if you have never ridden before, it might not be the best idea to start because you're trying to multi-task on a horse. But if you are looking for something different to do in Buenos Aires and want to get out into the country, go see Fe"

The game was not that furious as the real games since we were not that talented yet.. ;) But it was great fun!!! In the end we got a ride back.

He takes small groups to games and ensures that he spends time chatting with each of his guests. He speaks fluent english and patiently answers everyone's questions about the game. I have been to games in palermo and games in the country. Both experiences were wonderful. The games in Palermo featured the highest level of skill and the games were fast and furious. The games in the country were still skilled and allowed a more intimate glimpse into the world of the \"polo elite\". I would recommend taking advantage of both experiences if you have the opportunity.Fernando also teaches and coaches polo from beginner to advanced. I have taken a lesson and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Meeting other people who are on the trip was part of the positive experience. Fernando creates a warm and welcoming environment that encourages conversation. Go check out a game or take a lesson with Polo Elite. It's a true Argentinian experience and much more cost affordable than other places where you might go to a game.You won't regret it."

Fernando was entertaining and informative for the whole journey....on arrival his ponies were ready for us, helmets to hand, and his instruction for our polo lesson was clear and delivered with patience and good humour. We spent 2 to 3 hours working hard in the saddle!We shared mate with one of the stable hands before Fernando delivered us back to the City... weary, dusty and a little sore but very happy after our day in the countryside.This is not your super slick '100 tourists a day' operation.... Fernando makes it a personalized experience, and he does a fantastic job.....but expect to take your own water and snacks, and facilities are well cared for but rustic. I have no hesitation in recommending Fernando for small or larger groups of people of all ages, you dont need to be a super rider but some level of fitness is required. It's not a cheap activity but it is great value when you consider the level of instruction and quality of horseflesh, and inclusion of transfers.

Polo Elite was the only option I could find that offered lessons in English, with little commitment required...it's not a touristy estancia experience, but a great \"crash course\" if you only have a day and cant learn polo over a week! The instruction was simple and clear, the horses great and you meet wonderful other travelers! Since my first day with Polo Elite, I've ridden with Fernando numerous times after that day, and can now boast that I play polo! I'm still a novice, but polo is in my blood and Polo Elite put it there!!"

While doing some research for a trip to BA and knowing that Argentina was known for its Polo, I was curious if any places around the city offered lessons. In all honesty I didn't really expect to find anything or if I did it would be on the expensive side. I was very pleased to come across Fernando and Polo Elite and couldn't have made a better choice. Not only was it extremely affordable, Fernando offers an unbelievable experience for someone like myself with basic horse riding experience and for my girlfriend who had never been on one before. Not only was the actual playing experience great, everything about being out at the ranch and seeing a different side of Argentina was perfect after spending the previous 4 days in the city. While BA was great, the best part of the trip for me was meeting Fernando and getting to learn more about Polo. As soon as I got back to NJ I started looking for local Polo clubs to take more lessons. If anyone is considering booking some time with Polo Elite I couldn't recommend it more, you will not be disappointed."

Most of us had only minimal experience of horse riding but Fernando explained everything very clearly (in excellent English) and by the end of the day we were able to play a game of polo together. It was a pleasure to see how well the horses are bred and looked after - they're used for polo tournaments (in which Fernando plays with his team) throughout the summer. While Fernando's skill is clear, he's also a great teacher who divides his time between everyone but recognises when someone needs a bit more attention, whilst always keeping it fun and lighthearted. I had an absolutely brilliant time, this is a definite \"must do\" while in Buenos Aires!"

It was really enjoyable watching Fernando pick out the horses we were going to play with, and he let me brush them and get to know them before we played. My partner has never ridden a horse before but he was riding and hitting the ball by the end of the day. Fernando was a very patient and positive teacher, and very knowledgeable and passionate about polo. He kindly dropped us off at a famous parilla restaurant in San Telmo at the end of the day, and recommended some traditional dishes to order (that provoleta was yummy!).

Fernando's english is excellent and his teaching style is encouraging and positive. Everyone learned a lot about the game and basic horsemanship! The next time we were in BA in February/March 2013 Fernando took us and our friends to see a match in Palermo. We were able to see an insiders view of the polo scene - arriving before the game to see players and ponies warming up and staying after the game to enjoy a beer with some of the players!

After the beautiful drive to the fields, we received a brief, but thorough riding lesson, got mounted up and headed out to the fields. The first part of the day is dedicated to learning how to use the mallet and hit the ball both forehand and reverse. Its a blast being out in the fields atop an incredible horse riding up and down the field learning how to play such an incredible sport. After a break for lunch, its time to play an actual match against the other riders, which was the true highlight. Fernando teaches you the rules and how to defend (TOTALLY different than you'd expect) and then you're off. You could never have such freedom to throw someone on a horse and go at it in the US, but it's totally safe, well run and an experience not to be missed. We had 4 days in BA so plenty of time, but if I only had one day in BA, I would skip the city, the tango lessons, etc. and go out with Polo Elite!!!"

My friend, my daughter and I were visiting Argentina from Hong Kong for a riding holiday in the Andes and had contacted Polo Elite as we had read excellent reviews on Trip Advisor - we were not disappointed. From the start, Fernando was prompt, informative and very helpful and friendly when replying to our questions since even though we are regular riders this was our first polo experience. The day before our lesson Fernando contacted us to let us know that as it had been raining heavily the day before he could not guarantee that the lesson would go ahead as the ground might not be suitable \u2013 Fernando\u2019s priority at all times is for the safety of the rider and the ponies. At the same time however he was conscious of the fact that we had only one day in BA and no time to reschedule and it was clear that he was doing his best to make sure everything worked out for us and that we didn\u2019t miss out on this experience as we had travelled so far.The following day we decided that we would drive to the ranch and Fernando would check the pitch first to see if it was safe. He picked us up promptly in the city and we had an enjoyable drive out to the ranch which is about an hour outside of BA. It was obvious that Fernando is very knowledgeable about the polo world and polo ponies and very entertaining at the same time. After an interesting tour of the stables, we luckily managed to fit in a 45 minute lesson before it started to rain heavily again. Even in the short space of time Fernando gave us an excellent feel of polo. He was patient and very clear in his instructions and took particular care of my 11 year old daughter to make sure that she was safe but still having fun. The ponies were responsive, very well trained and cared for and equally as patient \u2013 even when I kept accidently hitting the back of my pony\u2019s legs (and her nose once) with the mallet she didn\u2019t flinch or get annoyed once!Despite not having chance to play a match due to the rain, we still had an excellent afternoon and can highly recommend Polo Elite and Fernando as an experience not to be missed whatever your level of riding ability. It is definitely something we would do again if we are ever in BA."

My boyfriend and I were down in Argentina for vacation, and both of us wanted to play a little polo while down there. Fernando gave me a quick and informative response to my query about private lessons, and from that point on, was very helpful and very, very nice. I put a deposit down for the lessons via Xoom, and secured a spot for both my boyfriend and I. The day before our lessons were scheduled, Fernando contacted me and let me know that due to rain, the polo lessons would be limited, and if I'd like to change dates to get the full lesson on a dry polo field? I said yes, since I used to ride hunter/jumpers professionally and really wanted to be able to gallop, run and do all that on my polo pony. He was very VERY helpful in rearranging his schedule to accommodate us, and even though it was his birthday he STILL took the time to teach us, since we were leaving soon and didn't have another day to wait!The lessons were amazing, the horses were high quality, and so was the tack. The ponies were fell fed, in good condition, and cared for with an obviously loving hand. Fernando was a great instructor, his English was very good, and provided us with water and transport to and from our rental apartment in the city. In addition, he also gave some great recommendations for local tack stores and even offered to go get the items we needed for us! All in all, a great experience and I would DEFINITELY do it again! As someone who rode horses professionally for many years, I was very pleased with Fernando's professionalism and his care of his tack and polo ponies. I'm rather picky when it comes to riding and I don't want to be stuck on a beginner's \"old nag\" that is old and not energetic, and I don't like having instructors treat me like I am a beginner. Fernando didn't do this at all, and was very accommodating and let me run around and chase balls on a very fit and energetic, well trained horse. My boyfriend, who is a beginner, was also accommodate to his skill level, so it's nice to know that Fernando can accommodate everyone, from every skill level, with ease and professionalism.He also took photos of us while riding, and sent them very quickly to us after the polo lesson! :) That was so helpful, because my boyfriend and I didn't get many shots of each other since we were having so much fun playing polo! If you are looking for a polo instructor, no matter what your skill level with riding, please pick Polo Elite and Fernando--great guy, great stables, great lessons!!"

He gave our group of 4 very clear instructions and demonstrated the techniques. We were given time to try things out on our own, though he always kept an eye on us and provided tips whenever one of us struggled. One member of our group had prior riding experience so he tailored his instructions so she would also enjoy and learn from the outing. We then learned how to hit the ball and, once we mastered that, we learned a few defensive moves. After we were comfortable with the basic skills, he taught us the rules of the polo and we played a match! It may have only vaguely resembled the professional match that we watched afterwards, but it was still so much fun! After the program, Fernando was kind enough to arrange for us to be driven directly to the airport as we had a flight to catch. It was a wonderful privilege to learn how to play polo from Fernando, especially since my husband and I have only ridden a horse once before. You can tell he's had plenty of experience teaching beginners and his passion for the game is infectious. This is the ideal way to spend a day away from the city!"

Fernando, a professional polo player, was a generous and amazing host for the day who spoke perfect English. Fernando was able to cater to everyone's very different riding abilities. I love horse riding and ride weekly at home in Australia. As an experienced rider, I really appreciated how Fernando got into the polo lesson straight away and allowed me to go at a faster pace than others (like my dad) who had not had much riding experience. Fernando uses his own professional polo horses for the lessons and they are all amazingly well trained. I felt very privileged to be allowed to ride them! It was a really fun day and my whole family really enjoyed it. I made some great friends from this experience too. I highly recommend Polo Elite as a must-do in Argentina. Thanks so much, Fer! :)"

Fernando was very friendly and happily answered all our burning questions regarding Polo. Once we got to the farm Fernando gave us a short lesson on how to ride a horse one-handed and how to control it. We then hopped onto one of his horses and rode to the Polo pitch. There we practised what we have just been taught. His horses were extremely well-behaved and easy to ride, which was great! We then learnt how to hold a mallet and how to hit the ball without hitting the horses ;-) It was all very enjoyable and Fernando was very patient with us. After a nice break with a refreshing, cold drink, Fernando explained to us the rules of Polo, after which we played a proper game! It was a lot of fun :-) Polo Elite is definitely recommendable!"

I hadn't ridden a horse since high school and my 22 year old son has never ridden. As it was our first trip to Argentina, I found it only fitting to try polo out. Fernando is a classy, sweet, polite, patient and professional guy and our day with him was FANTASTIC! He picked us up with his modern, spacious van and dropped us back off at the end of our day, to a convenient location in the city of Buenos Aires. (He is a very safe driver!) He taught us how to ride/control a horse and made us feel very comfortable. Then, he taught us how to properly hold a polo mallet and how to hit the ball. What fun we had, trying!! Fernando rode along with us and kept a close eye on everyone in our group, giving us individual and group tips all along the way. It's very exciting to (once in a while) get it right and when you do, you can \"feel\" it, after a little bit of practice. :) When we played a game with Fernando and the others that were in our group, we had SO MUCH FUN!! I didn't want the day on that BEAUTIFUL horse farm, to ever end. If you get the chance to spend the day with Fernando and his horses, I promise that it will be a most memorable experience."

Fernando (the pro polo player and guide for the day) picked the group up at the corner of Lima and chile and took us to the hacienda an hour away. His english is great, he's genuinely interested in getting to know his 'pupils', tries to accommodate where possible, with one to one tuition if necessary. Safety is priority but he also wants you to have fun. First we got shown around the hacienda, met the horses, given tips and then we were on the horse and having a go. Be warned, don't expect to be galloping everywhere, not only does it make it harder to hit the ball but unless all the horses are galloping they are all likely to just walk. If you are a beginner rider its ideal but if you are a bit more advanced they simply won't budge more than a trot because their pals aren't doing the effort so why should they! The weather was great, we finished the couple of hours on horses with a few 'matches', 2 against 2 which was entertaining. Then we went to watch Fernando play with his team a full match against a rival team. This was fascinating, especially as during the breaks he would come over and explain things/have a chat. Makes it special and more personal than just watching a polo match from the stands. The day started at 10:30, and got back by 8pm ish. Food is not provided so bring a sandwich + water or you could get it from the village on route. Hope this helps, have fun. Fred"

I have heard from several people that the typical Estancia can be a complete tourist trip. I chose to go a different route and take them to Polo Elite- for a day filled of fun horseback riding, and learning how to play polo. The experience exceeded all expectations. Fernando was wonderful, patient, fun and excited to share his knowledge with us. Even though none of us had ever played polo before he made it very comfortable for all of us. If I have any other future visitors, I will be sure to share this experience with them."

Because I was traveling by myself, Fernando needed to work me in with another group. He invited me out to join two other Americans on one of the most beautiful days I have had since being in Argentina. The weather was fantastic and we enjoyed the drive talking and sharing stories. Once we arrived at the place, it was not long before we were on the horses taking instruction from Fernando. He is an excellent coach - very knowledgeable, encouraging, and an excellent rider. His horses are top-notch, as well - very well-mannered, beautiful, and athletic horses. After riding for awhile, we took a lunch break and watched Fernando school two of his other horses. It was so relaxing to sit under the trees on such a beautiful day. After lunch we played a match (boys vs. girls) and had a great time! One of the grooms was nice enough to take pictures of me while riding with my camera. I am so happy to have these pictures to remember such a wonderful day! I was sad to leave when the day was over. If I ever make it back to Argentina, I will definitely make another trip to Polo Elite! Make sure to book with Fernando if you want first-hand experience with a true Argentinian sport! You will have an amazing time!"

Not only was it a blast learning how to play polo for a day and then playing a match at the end, but the whole day was incredible, including a tour of the gorgeous estate and watching Fernando and the pros play a match during our break.  Both my husband and I are experienced riders but previous riding experience is not necessary (and it could even work against you at first as polo is very different from other equestrian sports). One could not ask for a better instructor for learning polo than Fernando - he is patient, funny, kind, encouraging and has a true passion for and knowledge of the sport. He also took photos and videos of us so you can always look back on the day with smiles, laughter and fond memories. This is a must-do activity while you're in Argentina; it is a truly authentic experience and it will be the most fun you'll have while you're there. You'll also be to appreciate this thrilling sport that much more once you've had first hand experience. We hope to return to Argentina and when we do, we plan on making it more a polo-focused trip and will without a doubt be returning to Polo Elite. Thanks Fernando for everything!"

We visited Buenos Aires for the first time last November and had an absolute amazing time out there, from checking out all of the little towns to different museums and gardens. We experienced the incredible nightlife and even went to a hostile, local futbol match! By far, however, the best thing we did there was take this Polo lesson at Polo Elite with Fernando. It was a laid back agenda where we first got to watch some advanced players play a match, then we got on our own horses to get comfortable with them. Then, we were given the polo sticks and taken through a crash course on the rules and strategies of the game. We practiced a few basic polo drills and then even played a small-sided match! It was so much fun. Fernando was very patient with all of us yet still encouraging. And for the ladies, he's extremely on the eyes. I had a difficult time getting my girlfriend to concentrate on the actual game! Anyway, I will lastly mention that its one thing to watch a professional polo match live. For someone who has never played the sport, it was a completely different experience to watch that match AFTER taking this lesson and developing much more of an appreciation for the amazing talent that these Polo players are. The place offers half a day and full day lessons. We did the Half day and it was plenty. I had so much fun, however, I could easily have done the full."

Nonetheless to Polo Elite I went for a half day, with Fernando taking the reins as our excellent instructor. I can honestly say it was one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life. To have control over your horse while smashing that little ball around the field is exhilarating, and a wonderful feeling when you start to get the hang of it. Fernando has an infectious passion for the game, highly skilled and with an envious horsemanship that I will one day maybe emulate. My only disappointment was just booking a half day. You need to do this. Your life depends on it. Get in that saddle."

It's a great opportunity to do something that is authentically Argentine outside the Buenos Aires, perfect for Sundays when there isn't much going on in the city anyway. Four of us got picked up in the city by Fernando, who was very patient with us despite our lack of skill on a horse and knowledge of the sport. You can tell he is very passionate about the sport he makes his living from. He'll take you out in the morning to teach you technique, you break for lunch, then he teaches you the rules of the game before you play a match. A great day overall, and you truly learn an appreciation for the sport and why Argentina is so proud of their polo culture."

Despite two of us being almost 60 without any horse experience Fernando had all of us on horseback, with helmets and mallets in hand. Fernando is a very, very good teacher, we could not have achieved this otherwise. This will be a lifetime memory that I will smile about for a longtime. Don't be reluctant to give Polo Elite a try as the drive in the country is worth the price alone. Many thanks, Fernando."

Fernando was immediate in his response to my email with information on the excursion. He picked us up in Buenos Aires and we went out to the ranch. It's interesting to get out of the city, see some of the countryside, and a smaller town in Argentina as you head out to the ranch. The ranch is down a beautiful tree lined path. Lunch is up to you, you must plan, but Fernando stopped for us to pick up some food before we went to the ranch, so that is an option. We had both rode horses so we did not need that instruction so we got right to the lesson. Fernando was patient, answered all of our questions, and worked with us to make sure it was as fun of an experience as possible. When you get to play a game and the horses have to move faster and you jostle each other, that's when the real fun happens. I've never ridden such a quick agile horse and it's a fun challenge to try to run and hit the ball.We had a great time with Fernando and would highly recommend to anyone! Also if you go in the South American winter, make sure you bring warm enough layers because the winds across the fields can be chilly."

It has been nearly 25 years since I've been on a good polo pony with mallet in hand, so it was wonderful to discover Polo Elite on a recent trip to Buenos Aires. Fernando Nieto, the owner and instructor, is a great guy. Although he is relatively young to the game -- it's not unusual for Argentine kids to start swinging a mallet on horseback at age 6 -- Fernando is a knowledgeable and patient teacher who speaks English quite well, should that be a concern. He made it especially easy by picking us up in downtown BA for the 55km trip out to the estancia and back. All in all, it was a wonderful afternoon at exactly the level I was looking for after such a long lay-off. I hope to get back to BA in 2013 and will definitely book a couple more sessions at Polo Elite."

My husband and I returned a few days ago from 11 wonderful days in Buenos Aires, and we both agree that a day at Polo Elite was the highlight of our trip. Fernando was a great teacher who showed true passion for what he did. We couldn't believe that we were actually playing polo after about 2 hours! Fernando was a few minutes early in picking us up(defying the Argentine-time rule) from the center of BA and drove us about 45 minutes into the serine countryside village of Maximo Paz where the camp was located. Entering the camp, a long row of Eucalyptus trees lined a pretty gravel road and three friendly dogs and a tiny orange kitten welcomed us onto their territory. Within about 15 minutes of arriving, we were given our horses and the lesson began sitting atop these magnificent beauties. Fernando was very professional and humorous at the same time, graceful and patient with us answering all our questions and easily packing in the basic rules and lessons of Polo in fluent English. After lunch, we got back on our horses and actually played a match! There was another couple from England there and my husband being British, the teams were split England vs. The Rest of the World. And guess who won?! Yep, the rest of the world! Perhaps thanks to the comical goal my husband made in the wrong side! It was a lot of fun and we didn't want to stop playing if it wasn't for the breathtaking sunset that signaled the end of our day.  At this point, we couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more. Then, Fernando brought out the cold beer and the British couple whipped out a large bag of crisps! Contented, we sat in the silo and chatted and toasted and munched as the lights grew dim around us. In sum, we highly recommend Polo Elite, and Fernando made our trip to Buenos Aires unforgettable!"

In our small group of 4 there were people with varying degrees of riding experience but Fernando was somehow able to teach us all the basics of polo over the course of the day - we even managed a mini match in the afternoon. We rode Fernando's own horses and they were beautiful - beautifully groomed, responsive, and well-behaved. PS take some lunch with you."

I had an awesome experience each time, in fact I'd play at home if there was anywhere to play. Fernando is a great instructor and very patient. I would just recommend eating beforehand or taking food with you as there's not a lot of accomodations out at the farm. Speaking of the farm, it's beautiful, very lush and rustic, a nice escape from the urban landscapes of BA."

This is something for the whole family/group, independent of earlier experience with horse! During my three week vacation in Brazil and Argentina, this was absolute the best day! We all agree in that :D The area is beautiful and peaceful, the people are very friendly, and the horses was really good! Compared to other attraction with horses the quality on the horses here was superior! These horses were top trained, healthy, and very obedient. I loved just loved it, and I would like to spend many days there just to feel the atmosphere and enjoy the polo riding! :D"

A couple of girls from Germany were also there to have a lesson and get their first swing at a ball from the back of a horse.All in all a great way to experience a slice of the real Argentina ... for those who would rather see the a country through it's people .. rather than prescribed in a tourist brochure.Enjoy your trip to Argentina and look up Fernando if you get a chance."

Our group consisted of 3 others in addition to us and Fernando. The drive took us out of the city near Estancia Villa Maria, where Micheal Buble got married. The field was freshly manicured and there were multiple fields to play in. Fernando's horses were neatly standing underneath the trees waiting to play Polo. It was a beautiful site. We began by learning standard riding techniques followed by Polo rules and tricks. He didn't waste much time getting us on the horses. We first just worked on basic horsemaship as some in the group had little experience. The horses provided sew well-mannered and perfect for beginners at polo and horses. Once we were comfortable with the horses we learned about some of the basic rules of polo. We learned the basics of the polo sticks, how to hold, how to position our bodies and how to control the ball. We concluded the first part of the lesson and had a picnic lunch in a small meeting area consisting of the sandwiches de miga we had ordered from Lima Bar before leaving B.A. After lunch we had the opportunity to watch theo club teams play a practice match. Wow, it was amazing to see them play at such a high speed. Finally, after the practice match ended we had the chance to play our own practice match on a much shorter field.

We had some truly fun adventures but the one we still talk about the most is our day with Fernando at Polo Elite! Fernando picked us up at the arranged meeting place and brought us out to a beautiful ranch. The horses are beautiful, very well trained and extrememly responsive (in spite of our overall lack of natural ability!). Fernando was a patient instructor and in no time we were playing a match. The girls (with help from Raul) beat the boys! We laughed the entire time. To end the afternoon, we had a snack and a cold beer. It was perfect!After we returned home, Fernando emailed pictures to us (another nice surprise!) and we got to relive the experience.Thanks for a great time Fernando!!"

I generally echo the positive sentiments of the previous reviews.I've riden horses on a few occasions but have never had any formal training so don't let being a 'non-rider' put you off, the game can still be learnt at walking pace if necessary, although I have little doubt you'll soon be going faster than that.Fernamdo was a real pleasure to deal with from the initial booking emails, pick-up & drop-off in BA andn of course the lessons and mini game we played at the end.It's worth mentioning that this is as real as the experience gets and you can take it to whatever level you are comfortable with as you are using the horses Fernando competes with and his equipment.For those who do ride, apparently these horses are very different to what you are used to and incredibly willing to work hard for you.I'd say that for anyone with say 3+ days in BA it's worth taking a day or half day to do this, it stands out as a highlight of our trip.No special equipment or clothing is required, lunch was included in the price."

It is good for groups of 4-8 people. You do not need riding experience or polo experience; Fernando will teach you everything you need to know. He is an extremely patient instructor and gives excellent advice on how to to play. Most importantly, he makes sure that everyone has a good time. He took a lot of photos while we were riding and then sent them to us afterwards. This was particularly helpful, as it is tough for novice riders to take a photo on the go.

There are very word that express how awesome Fernando is patient, accomodating, encouraging, talented, cool..the list goes on and on ..HE really made the experience even more awesome than it already was ..I would recommend you make this excursion a priority ..hopefully your group will be as awesome as the group we were in ..as that too makes the experience richer..but Fernando and Polo Elite will alway be (for us ) one of our best vacation memories ever!!THANK YOU FERNANDO!!!"

Fernandon picked us up from the city center and took us to his beautiful club outside of BA. Not having any experience playing polo let alone ever even riding a horse I was anxious to see how good the day would be.Fer completely blew me out of the water with the day's activities. Not only did he teach us the game of polo and the finer points of how to excell at it, he also taught me how to ride a horse. After teaching us how to control the horses, he taught us the rules of the game, how to control the stick and hit the ball and how to play defense and then we put it all together in a real game. The entire time Fer was patient with us and gave helpful tips on how to better enjoy the game and our time on the horses.No review could do justice for how great the experience was and that it made the trip to BA better than we could have expected.Forget the usual tourist activities, go off the beaten path a bit and enjoy a day with Polo Elite in the beautiful Argetine countryside. I know we are glad we did and expect to be back in the future to sharpen our skills with Fer again. Thanks for the memories!Darcy and Ed"

It is amazing how you can learn the basics of an entire sport (and one which is usually very inaccessable) in just a few hours. Fernando has a great sense of humour (very witty and dry) and is the quintessential Argentinian. The game at the end was fantastic (and very close) - we wanted to keep playing well into the night. Also, if our experience is anything to go by, this experience attracts a great group of people (our group got along like a house on fire and went out for dinner together afterwards)."

I should start off by saying I am a rider so I was more comfortable in the saddle than most people but I have never played polo before. Our group was made up of mostly beginners and even some who had never been on a horse. Fernando took time with each student to make them comfortable and match them with the right horse. We practiced for a while, took a break, and then played a game. Fernando coached, played and took photographs of the game for us. If you are at all interested in the sport of polo I highly recommend you take the time out of you trip to spend a day with Fernando. He is an excellent teacher and makes the sport very accessible."

Both my husband and I had very little experience riding horses, and Fernando, our instructor, immediately made us feel comfortable with his expert coaching. After a good amount of practice (riding and simply trying to make contact between mallet and ball), we played a really fun game of two on two. It's amazing how much progress we made in just a few hours! After the \"match\" Fernando treated us to a bottle of Quilmes and snacks! The whole experience was great. We were picked up and dropped off at a convenient location in SF, and the fields where we played were beautiful. Fernando was friendly, patient, and highly skilled! I highly recommend the experience - truly one of a kind!"

            "review": "Hard as hell, but made accessible by the instructor. We were picked up about 15 minutes later than the 2:30 pick up time, not that we were bothered but the driver, Fernando, apologized and promptly loaded us up in the extended mini van. I was there alone, there was also a solo Aussie guy, and 4 Americans, one of which was a petite-lady-rider, all MBA students at Columbia in NYC. RIde was just less than 40 KM out. During the ride we discovered that our commonwealth representative had a friend go on the training but a few days before us and had fallen off the horse. He was fine less some surface injuries but an important thing came up: don't wear hiking boots, it's possible you can get them stuck. Better to wear riding boots if you actually have them or light trainers that allow you to still feel your foot's surroundings. After taking some dirt roads inward of the trip, we arrived to the ranch without issue. Waivers were signed on a picnic bench cluster, cold water was distributed, and as we chatted among us, the instructor, Fernando our driver, went to pull helmets and the remaining requisite equipment: a horse whip and the necessary mallet. Some sizing, a few questions and answers and we sauntered over to the mares. It was all very relaxed nothing rushed. None of us, with the exception of the Aussie, had any riding experience to speak of, so Fernando demonstrated technique and methodology from how to use the reins to how to sit properly and avoid annoying the horses. This went on a little while longer than if we had any idea what we were doing on a horse, but it was certainly necessary. We graduated up to being able to practice hitting balls with the mallets, doing our best to move the ball up the field and and back down it. We had a break at that point and during the break there was theory discussion: what is legal, what triggers a foul, how to work as a team to move the ball up, how to play defense with hooking, etc. Then it was on to the second riding term which included us splitting up into teams. Surprisingly there was a lot of scoring and Fernando was pretty generous about setting it up so we could realize a few goals. All in all, it's really tough for beginners with no riding experience to get into something like Polo in a matter of a couple hours. However, the instructor, Fernando, does an excellent job of helping instructees make it happen. Our smallest and only female teammate even ended up playing some mean defense at one point, that from two hours before when the whole group was wondering out loud how we were ever going to get this tiny person on those tall horses. When it was all finished, horses stored to the stables and equipment put away, all I could think of was that a cold beer would be life changing. Like mana from heaven, my prayers were answered when Fernando turned the corner with two big bottles of cold Quilme beer. In summary, polo is a difficult and potentially precarious undertaking. If you are even slightly afraid of horses or the idea of controlling the beast while also needing to manage a mallet and a whip, then you'll need to be a little more brave, but the instructor really does a great job of dumbing things down so that you can get into it while also giving you a chance to push it if you'd like, if you're comfortable. Most importantly, after this experience, I am keen to improve my riding skill so that I can play again because especially when we got into the match at the end it was some of the best fun I've had in a field, ever."

I emailed Fernando of Polo Elite a year in advance hoping that he would be open the day after Christmas. He said that he was and my boyfriend and I made reservations to learn to play polo with him. This may have been slightly farther in advance than needed as other people playing that day actually made reservations the day before. But, this was something that my boyfriend and I really wanted to try! We had the BEST time. Fernando is PERFECT for his job. His English is great and he gave wonderful instructions. He did a good job teaching us the basics of riding before teaching us the basics of polo. The horses are very well broke. I felt safe the entire time. My boyfriend had never ridden before but he was cantering up and down the field in no time. Fernando provided everyone in the group with a snack and a rest after we had practiced for quite some time. We were lucky enough to see him and his friends play a \"real\" match while we were resting. It provided a great time to take pictures of real polo horses and to see how the game should really be played. We enjoyed it! Then after our rest we got to play our own match. It was the most fun we've had on a vacation!! We were laughing so hard (and still are). We played boys against girls and the boys won (barely!). My bf and I each scored a couple of goals so we were quite proud of ourselves! We enjoyed a beer after playing and then Fernando drove us all back to BA. We were a bit late getting back into town (around 9pm or so--I guess that is still very early in Argentina) so Fernando was kind enough to drop all 8 of his guests off at their respective hotels. We left with the BEST impression. I can't think of anything that Polo Elite could do different to make this a better experience. My bf and I both said that this experience is worth so much more than we paid! We did tango shows and other BA attractions while we were there that cost much more but were not nearly half the fun! We just can't stop talking about how much fun we had. Fernando also emailed a few pictures to us after we returned home that are wonderful souvenirs. We'll recommend this experience to everyone visiting BA!!!"

Having read the excellent reviews on here I was looking forward to the day but unfortunately my experience wasn\u2019t quite so impressive. Fernando was very organised and responsive in dealing with my initial inquiry but on the day we got off to a rather delayed start. We set off from the pick up point 30minutes later than planned at 2.30pm, followed by a bit of a detour en route, it turns out that Fernando needed a gas station to fill up the minibus. We were very relieved and excited to reach the estancia but by this point it was 4pm so it seemed a bit of a rush to make up for lost time. As most of us had limited riding experience Fernando gave us a run through on how to control the horse and then we got started. We met our horses but didn\u2019t learn their names which some of us were curious to know as we wanted to connect with them. Unfortunately, mine along with a couple of others didn\u2019t seem to want to move off despite using the techniques we had been given. In the few previous times I have ridden (to a fair standard) this has never been a problem so I was confused and wanted to understand what I needed to be doing more/less of. I asked Fernando but he whipped my horse himself and said \u2018there she moves\u2019 which she did to be fair but it didn\u2019t help me to gain control or greater understanding. I am aware that in a group activity there is little time to cater to individual needs but when it came to hitting the balls and playing the match those of us who were having problems moving on our horses, like myself, were at a disadvantage. Fernando did change my horse for me but there wasn\u2019t a great amount of difference which made me want to learn even more how to improve my technique and most importantly move at a pace which enabled me to fully participate. Of course I had come full of enthusiasm to enjoy and succeed in playing polo but could only describe my experience very loosely in terms of playing polo. Some of the group seemed to be happy with their achievements as they felt that had succeeded in being a polo player for a couple of hours and have photos to prove this. I think that the experience sets itself an ambitious task in teaching how to learn to ride a horse and play polo within 4 hours and the results will always be to varying degrees of success. Fernando is clearly an instructor who is very passionate about playing polo and I guess we achieved what the day says, we rode horses, learnt how to hit balls and played a mini tournament. If however you are interested in developing lasting skill and understanding technique and control then you may not find it to be the best or most rewarding option for you."

We traveled to Argentina (Calafate, Chalten, Cafayate, Salta, Cordoba and BA) with two kids aged 11 & 12 who are both (beginners) horseback riders. The parents had never sat on a horse, but we wanted to experience polo (seeing it live would have been enough). At the end we not only got to view a game but also got lessons from Fernando (the owner) as well as a good country-style lunch in the shade at an adjacent hotel/restaurant that belonged to the Polo Club...which also included a refreshing swim in the pool overlooking the polo fields. Our kids absolutely loved the horses, polo, tour and above all Fernando's patient teaching/coaching that was meticulous, professional and level-relevant. Despite the fact that our muscles hurt for a few days after, we decided to wrap up our trip two weeks later with another visit to the Club with Fernando. Although it was 1/1/12 (not ideal day for a visit), Fernando was extremely flexible and again picked us up at our hotel and organized another unforgettable day with him and his 8 (!) horses (there are hundreds of horses at the Club). Fernando took the time (and seemed to enjoy) to teach us more theory about polo and horses in general (care, health, psychology, cost) which both parents and kids enjoyed. For our son in particular, this could become a pivotal moment in his life as he is now determined to start playing polo ;-) ! We all had a lot of fun.Overall, this was a very stress-free day full of enjoyment and learning that our family will not forget and it was largely thanks to the professionalism and pleasant style of Fernando. I would strongly recommend spending a full day (he also does half day tours) with Polo Elite if you have two days or more to spend in Buenos Aires."

I joined friends in Buenos Aires for a for several days and were loking for an outing outisde of the city before heading home to the states.This was a spur of the moment outing and after being quoted a ridiculous price (over $1000 for three people) by another operator, this was by far the best price and most reputable company. I spoke with Fernando, whose primary concern (due to heavy rains on the previous day) was not money -- but the condition of the field for the safety of horse and rider. That spoke volumes. As it turned out: we paid $145 pp -- the full day price -- plus 100 pesos for pickup at our apartment (free if you are in the city center) for lessons, polo play, lunch and drop off at the airport at the end of the day. And an additional surprise waited for us in the ranch house at end: a coffee service complete with pastries and homemade breads before heading out.This estanchia stretched out over 150 acres and housed nearly as many horses. With two large houses on the property for corporate events, the ranch featured numerous polo fields, plus a small hotel for overnight guests and (the original) ranch house. where we dined.The three of us had some (minimal recent) riding experience but no polo experiece. Fernando, a handsome, affable polo player seved as our translator, driver, patient instrucutor and charming host. Easy going and friendly, nothing rattled him (not even our lack of skills). He was easy to work with and flexible, as evidenced even when our flights were delayed -- he went out of his way to accomodate us.Ater being fitted with horses and gear, we started out with a lesson on managing the horses, then we rode over to one of the polo fields where we performed drills, and played a bit before breaking for lunch. We dined alfresco under the shade of a pergola and nearby trees at the ranch house on an incredible spread of salads, grilled meats (chorizo, blood sausage, chicken and beef), accompanied by soda, water and wine. Fruit was served for dessert. After our fabulous lunch we rested (and were invited to swim in the pool) and watched as other guests and ranch hands played polo on the field in front of us. We again saddled up and played for another hour or so until sunset, before showering and heading back to the ranch house for coffee/dessert. Fernando drove us to the aiport and we all agreed that we would love to come back to Argentina and when we did -- this outing was definitely worth re-visiting."

The meeting point was a little strange for us, as we arrived way too early and we were the only guests there waiting on a Sunday morning.We had a beautiful day, and we enjoyed our time there very much. I was recovering from surgery, and my daughter is 8 so we are not going to quit our day jobs to be polo players, but we had fun. My daughter became friends with the owner's daughter, and I met some really neat people from Switzerland and Germany during lunch. We enjoyed watching the tournament going on while we were there. After a little misunderstanding, Fernando quickly made up for the issue, and delivered us to our apartment. Soon after, I received some great pictures from him. I would suggest you try this experience if you are in the area!"

My girlfriend and I spent yesterday on this tour and I would highly recommend it.Fernando is a really nice guy, the setting is really beautiful, our group were great fun....and the polo was great too. We were all pretty much absolute beginners (hardly any had been on a horse before) and we had our horse riding lesson, our polo basics lesson and we played the practice match. It is really gratifying to feel quite up for horse riding again. I would have thought it would have taken many lessons to get even the basics, but Fernando made it all quite easy for us.The day felt \"familiar\" due to the reviews, but all in a good way. All of the other reviews are right.Price wise it is not cheap, but Buenos Aires is not a cheap city for tourists. I thought about it for a while before booking, but am very glad that I did.

I am both a trainer Hunter Jumper and Dressage rider but have never played polo. This experience brought me back to younger times when I could just ride for the sheer joy of it. Fernando is an outstanding educator and has the patience of a saint. I am often nervous about riding \"lesson horses\" or \"rental horses\" as an experienced equestrian and equine advocate. Fernando earned my deep respect and trust when he spoke extensively about communicating with the horse in a friendly way. He demonstrated ways to ride that enhanced the communication and partnership with the horse, clearly a key aspect of any good polo partnership. I've been on a lot of trail rides in my life, on a lot of horses that had many many different unskilled riders on them, and Fernando's philosophy and direction offered us horses that had life and spirit but were not dangerous or dull. I could have stayed on that polo field for hours, days and weeks. I would love to return and spend a couple days at the facility and just practice. The facility in itself added to the experience and was breathtakingly beautiful. The added bonus of watching experienced players practice on the same field was both humbling and inspirational. The result of my day with my group and Fernando is that I am completely and totally hooked and am seeking polo lessons here in the states, so that when I return to Buenos Aires I can hold my own against the 10 year old. Thank you so much Fernando!!!!!"

My girlfriends and I booked the trip to Argentina and wanted to experience the country in its true form. Being a huge fan of Polo I wanted see real Argentine Polo in action. We knew that we couldn't leave Argentina without trying our hand at the sport. When we found Polo Elite lessons online we knew that we were in for an action packed day. Accommodating Staff: We were picked up in Buenos Aires by our instructor Fernando. He even dropped us off at the airport after the lesson since we had a flight to catch afterwards. They allowed us to bring our luggage to the site with safe storage. Environment: Polo Elite offered the perfect environment to learn the basics and even play a match between the other students. The horses are kept in safe areas and are treated in the most humane ways. They are also well trained to work with novice riders so even if you have never been on a horse you are able to quickly pick up the game. What stood out: - We were given a brief riding class and taught the basics of the sport. - Friendly environment with well kept horses and clean facility.- Patient and - Polo Elite picks out the right horse for its rider... i.e. I had 3 horses before I got Pepa... and she was awesome. With Pepa I scored 2 of our team's goals!! This was the highlight of our trip to Argentina and I know my friends and I left bragging about our new \"skills.\" Even if Polo isn't for you - this is a great way to see the Argentine countryside and watch the prettiest sunset in the country. I highly recommend Polo Elite to anyone looking for a fun-filled day!"

I just wanted to write and confirm what is being widely said by others who have been lucky enough to experience the fabulous tuition given by Fernando.I had never been on the back of a Polo horse before, but Fernando was quick to give assurances and clear instructions so that this novice could begin enjoying the horse. With care, Fernando then enabled me to grow at my own pace and get as much out of the experience as was possible.I enjoyed my day so much that I was keen to progress my skills in my new-found hobby, and signed-up for another day (and another). In the end, I enjoyed five full days on the ranch and I can definitely confirm that my riding and Polo skills improved!The ranch has fantastic facilities for both the horses and the players. As well as being treated to fabulous Argentine cuisine each day, at the on-site hotel, there is also a great pool which helps ease those muscles after a days workout on the horse.Finally, Fernando is a special tutor. He has a passion for horses and Polo which is tangible. As a former lecturer he is also a great communicator (and can take lessons in both Spanish and English). Over and above that, he cares deeply about the experience of his clients and is always thinking of ways in which they can be given an improved service. I cannot praise Fernando, and Polo Elite, highly enough. I now have a new passion for horses, and Polo, and its thanks to Fernando."

            "review": "Just OK. I decided to take a polo lesson at Polo Elite after reading the great reviews, but I have to say it did not quite live up to my expectations. It started off with Fernando being late picking us up at the pick up point. After that we had to wait for another couple that arrived almost half an hour after the agreed pick up time. When we finally left, the drive to the polo club (70 km outside of BA) took about 1hour and 15 minutes. When we arrived there, Fernando sort of showed us around the place for a bit. Before the lesson got started Fernando told us to leave our bags outside on a table. We asked him if we could put them in the car and if he could lock that for safety. He basically refused to do that and we had no choice but to leave the bags outside without anyone watching them. To be honest I don\u2019t find this good service. After this, we put on the helmets and received a very short general introduction as to how to ride a horse. We mounted the horses and rode to a field to practise. Fernando basically told us to practise riding without paying much attention to what everyone was doing or giving personal instruction. There were beginners in the group who were also left on their own.Then he explained to the group how to hold the mallet and hit the ball and we practised. Since I have never played polo before and I read a lot about Fernando being a great teacher, I expected some individual attention and tips on how to improve. However, I received none. We practiced hitting the ball up and down the field for a while on our own. We were most of the time walking and some of us tried hitting the ball trotting or cantering (this was our decision, we were not encouraged to do so). Fernando would just ride behind us and hit the balls forward when we missed them, but he did not offer any guidance. It would have been so much better if during this part of the lesson we would have received some instruction on how to hit the ball better and with more direction, or just some encouragement or confirmation if we were indeed hitting the ball in the right way. After practising for some time we took a break. Fernando put some water, a soft drink and some cookies on the table and left. He came back a little later to join us again. We got back on the horses and practised some more. At that time Fernano was in the field practising by himself.We ended the day playing a match, which was fun and for me basically saved the day. Fernando explained the basic rules of the game and how to defend and this time he did give some helpful tips and advice while we were playing. After we finished the match, he put a bottle of beer on the table and some time later he drove us back to the city.For me, if you offer a lesson, you have to teach people. I felt like I received an absolute minimum of instruction, which was dissappointing. Obviously you cannot expect to learn how to play real polo in a couple of hours, but I feel it could have been better than this."

He picked us up in Buenos Aires and drove us to the polo club. We were then shown around and allowed to relax before being given equipment and our ponies. I've had some tuition in the UK and I actually found the things I learned in these few hours more memorable, personally tailored and helpful. The first half of the session was stick and ball, then we had a break with refreshments and then chukkas. Fernando took photos of us while we were playing which was great. We had drinks after the session and we then driven back to Buenos Aires. I thought it was excellent value for money from a great teacher and I fully endorse this as a great day out."

We came as a group of three and everything was perfect!Fernando met us at the appointed place and time and we went of to the campo to meet his horses. After a lesson of polo for about an hour or more we took a break to eat lunch and afterwards had a little match which was so much fun! Fernando is a good teacher and his horses are very calm and easy to ride.If you have one free day at your hands you should definitely think about enjoying yourself out in the country this way!"

I am not super sporty and had not been on a horse in years, but Fernando took the time to go over basics and got everyone acclimated to their horse and the whacking of the ball from the horse! The horses are very well-trained and made up for some of their riders' deficiencies. The match we played with the other members of the group was too much fun.

We are city slickers, and totally inexperienced with horses. I was a bit apprehensive at the thought of playing polo because of this. I couldn't even imagine riding a horse and controlling the direction and turning the horse whilst holding the reins in one hand and a polo stick in the other. Yet it was something we had never done before so we felt it was worth a try. Even now I am amazed that after just a couple of hours we could all ride a horse, trot and canter, at times even gallop, hold a polo stick AND hit a polo ball at the same time! We even had a little polo \"match\". We had a great time and it was so much fun!. It was never boring, but very interesting as we were always learning something new. A great learning experience for the kids and adults alike. Fernando our host was very patient, a very good teacher and explained in easy to understand terms how to handle and control the horses. We were picked up at our apartments and dropped back at the end of the day. After the polo session, Fernando also introduced us to all his other horses. Such beautiful animals. The horses were so smart, responsive and well trained. Word of warning....if you are new to horse riding, parts of your body will be sore at the end of the day. Yet... it is worth it. Totally recommended. Everyone will enjoy it."

Not so cheap, but you do get fed and watered, picked up and dropped up really conveniently to your accommodation, get out to the countryside and Fernando is a chilled and ernest host and does have many horses to maintain!

We all had lots of individual time with Fer, and we felt very confident in his teaching. By the end of the day my friend and I were both hitting the ball on a trot, we played a polo match, and won 5-4!

Needless to say it proved much harder when we got on the horses ourselves, but was a lot of fun. I also ended up going to a polo match the following Saturday with Fernando and a bunch of other people. If you're there during the season and get the chance to do this, it was an awesome evening .

Learning about the game is terrific, it is so much more complex than expected but, after lessons in the basis and time on the horses to practice, you'll then have a fun game and will thoroughly enjoy yourself.We came away from our day, as did our fellow polo players, so excited after our game and keen to watch and play more polo.Our day started at 1.00pm and we were back in town by 7.00pm and we'd enjoyed a light snack and celebratory drinks.For more details see our blog at;http://anexperimentalyear.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/polo-single-seater-open-top-motoring-while-trying-to-hit-a-ball/"

Polo Elite is owned and operated by Fernando, who runs his business during the day and plays matches at night. Fernando will pick you up for the center of the city and transport you back to his ranch near the international airport. The event is setup into three stages: horse riding lessons (if you're a beginner), polo lesson, and a finally a match. Fernando will guide you through each portion of the lesson and by the end of the day you'll be craving more time on your trusty steed. The horses are well trained and will respond to your commands on a dime. Fernando himself is a extremely friendly and a blast to be around. He even kind enough to send us pictures of us during our match. I strongly recommend Polo Elite for anyone traveling to Buenos Aires. Please note that the minimum class size is 3 and is obviously weather restrictive. -Mike from Atlanta, GA USA"

Riding experience is absolutely not a requirement. Fernando gives you the right instructions so you can let the horse know what you want it to do and feel safe doing it. The horses themselves are well trained and calm but you can tell that if you were a better polo player they would be right there with you. To our utter amazement, we were actually playing a game by the end of the day. There are a lot of small touches, personal touches that make this experience stand out as well. Not only does Fernando drive you to and from the center of Buenos Aires to the farm on the outskirts, but he provides small snacks and drinks. He was a delightful instructor and host, and not a bad photographer (he sent over a treasure trove of digital pics after our outing). This experience is well worth the time and money."

The day spent with Fernando and his horses leaves one feeling both satisfied and lucky, and that is because this experience is so much more than simply a polo lesson. The semantics of the day are described well below - $100 usd, easy pickup/dropoff in downtown BA, a glimpse of the countryside, light lunch and drinks provided - which all equate to terrific value. However, the true gift of the day lies within Fernando himself. Fernando is a professional polo player, which means his livelihood depends on his horses. To entrust his prized possessions to complete strangers is a risky proposition, therefore, to start the day, Fernando will teach you how to ride a horse properly. Then you pick up a mallet and learn to hit a polo ball. After that, you learn the rules of the game. And finally, you will play the game. All of this under the guidance of Fernando, who is both a patient teacher and a gentleman. It is evident throughout the day how much he loves both his horses and polo, and it is out of this affection that you form a real connection with Fernando. At the end of the day as you walk off the field, you want nothing more than to get back on a horse and keep playing. Ultimately, you feel fortunate - afterall, you did just get a polo lesson from a professional polo player - and would gladly have paid double for it. This is simply a day that cannot be missed."

My travelling companion had never ridden a horse before (had in fact point blank refused to ride a horse up to this point) and by the end of the day was walking around hitting balls like a pro (I think all the golf practice paid off in unexpected ways). Fernando's passion for polo is obvious and while the rules of the sport remain totally mysterious to me the polo game at the end was a lot of fun. My only suggestion would be for some improvements to the bathroom facilities and make sure you take suncreen and mosquito repellant."

After some easy riding you get a mallet and go from there! After a short break we played a match and it was one of the most fun things I've ever done. So glad we booked it, DON'T MISS THIS IN BA!!"

There were citrus trees, flocks of parrots and cute puppies to play with, which was a treat. Then we got on the horses and it went from excellent to one of our best stories from South America!We had no horse back riding experience and were a little sore the next day, but it was so awesome. We wished the rest of our family had been there, it was probably the only BA activity that everyone would enjoy. I would do it again in a heart beat!"

It does not matter if you have no experience on a horse, you will learn and you will enjoy yourself immensely. Fernando is a great instructor-very informative, patient and encouraging. He also does a great job explaining the rules and strategies of polo. In my opinion, the best part is the scrimmage game of polo played in the latter half of the day. It was great-the players get into it, the horses get into it and it was a rewarding experience. Due to our positive experience, my husband and I are intent on watching polo matches this summer in our area."

Our afternoon of polo began with Fernando (who was very accommodating in scheduling our lesson) picking us up in the city and driving out to the training field. After a short, but well explained, tutorial on horse riding (we are beginners), we're on a horse practicing commanding and galloping. A short snack break while Fer gave us the basics on polo, and we're back on the horse with our polo gear to practice hitting balls with the mallet. A simulated match capped off our incredibly fun and exhilarating day.This was easily one of the best activities we did while vacationing in Argentina. Fernando was great, a very patient instructor and overall nice guy. Highly recommended!"

The hard part, like anything, is getting over the initial frustrations ..and hitting a ball with a long stick whilst riding a horse can be more difficult than it sounds! With Fernando, the learning curve is steep and he puts his students on horses as soon as possible - this can be a little daunting but it does mean that the frustrating process of learning to control a polo pony whilst attempting to hit the ball is beaten through very quickly. Fernando doesn't mess around and he is a strong and efficient teacher, and it seemed like no time before we were playing a game - charging our amazing polo ponies around with great enthusiasm.The key is good horses, and Fernando's are so responsive and well trained it's almost unbelievable to the unitiated. Fernando pushes his students into playing their first game using all the hooking, pushing and other tactics - a whole lot to learn in a short time, but the sheer competativeness of it all makes the experience great fun.Fernando speaks good English (having lived in the UK) and he explains and demonstrates everything very thoroughly. He is also a great player - inspiring his students as to what is possilbe on a polo pony."

We had both ridden horses only a couple of times before, but Fernando was patient teaching us how to ride, which took about an hour, and the horses were well behaved and did (most of) what we asked of them. Learning the rules of polo, how to hit the ball and the tackling / blocking manoeuvres were very interesting and after an hour's practise we got the hang of it. You then have a match at the end, and we discovered what an exhilirating feeling it is to chase after a ball on a horse. After this experience, we understood why polo can be so addictive! Fernando is a patient teacher and he is very keen to share his love of polo with others. The estancia is located in a beautiful location outside of BA and the horses are very well trained. You should not be nervous about participating even if you only have limited experience riding horses. We would both highly recommend this activity.Jan and Zo\u00ebCayman Islands"

Nobody was really confident in their abilities. So at first I wasn't sure that Fernando be able to get us up to a point where we could have a \"match\" but by the end of the day we were all chasing the ball around the field. None of us could do it at more than walking speed of course, but it was still lots of fun and I felt like I'd achieved something by the end of the day.

After reviewing the rules of the game, we remounted our polo ponies and played some polo. After \"match\" , we relaxed over a few beers and reflected over our new learned skill. On the way back to the city, we passed by a local polo club that was playing a game called \"Pato\" or Duck. Fernando stopped the van and walked us over to the match and explained the game to us, what a nice gesture. When I come back to the city with my family, I am definitely taking them to Polo Elite. Bottom line, even if you have never been on a horse, you can handle this."

Luckily Fernando and the other guests were kind enough to come back to BsAs a second time to collect us.The 30 mins drive took us out to a polo field just outside of BsAs where 5 of the most patient and accommodating horses I have ever seen were waiting for us. It's not that they were riding schol horses who shuffle along, but they were very good natured in having either non-experienced riders or non-experienced polo mallet wielders on their backs. We had a couple of hours or so getting used to the horses (a different style to english or western saddle riding) and then the mallets. We had a break in the middle of the day for a brief introduction to the rules and then got to play our own little match. Considering some people had never sat on a horse before, all nerves went out of the window when match fever took over and we had a fantastic time!I highly recommend this as a day trip - after all if you are going to try polo once in your life then it has to be in BsAs!!Many thanks to Fernando and the horses - a wonderful day"

The transport to and from the club is great, and drinks and snacks are kindly provided while there. The club itself is a nice place and the horses are all very well looked after, with a good polo community there, so you get the chance to watch some very good players play.Now, the important thing: The polo. The horses are incredibly trained and are great for beginners with no or little riding experience, but were equally as good for someone with quite a bit of riding experience, as they are Fernando's playing ponies and as a result are great! The lessons are good fun, with Fernando teaching you all the basics of the game, from the main swings to the rules of the game. Topped off by a mini beginners' chukka, this is as good as it gets for an introduction to polo.The trips to see the games are also highly recommended, and there is nothing better than lounging in the Argentine sun with a Fernet - Cola watching a game of polo on the weekend. Again, Fernando deals with transportation, so everything is covered. All you have to do is enjoy!For value, the lessons and the games are great. Everything is provided for you, and transport and snacks are included. For the same price in the UK, you would be lucky to get much time on horseback, and would learn nowhere near what Fernando shows you.A great trip."

This is more or less an all-day event (We were picked up at 3 pm and got back around 9:30).Fernando will pick you up somewhere in Buenos Aires, and you'll drive about 40 km out to the Polo Elite ranch. Never ridden a horse before? No problem. You'll spend the first part of the day learning to handle the horse. The horses are either remarkably well-trained, or Fernando is great teacher (or most likely, both), and you'll quickly have the horses responding to your slightest movements. Following your initial practice on the horse (which I imagine is very short if you're an experienced rider. I am not), you'll take the mallet in your hand and practice hitting and controlling the ball. If you're like me, the first time you try to direct the ball down the field will seem a bit daunting, but everyone seems to get the hang of it after a few passes up and down the field.Next up is a break (for you and the horses) with an explanation of the rules of the game. Then it's time to hop on the horses so that Fernando can demonstrate the basic rules and maneuvers of polo in practice. Then, time to play a match. If you're like my group, who generally had little experience with horses, the match is more entertainment than competition. Fernando plays the ref and continues to comment on rule violations and strategy throughout the match. Finally, once the sun starts to go down, it's time to give the horses a rest and toast a few beers before being driven back to wherever you need to go.The experience was a lot of fun, and I learned a great deal about horsemanship and polo in just a few hours. Fernando is very knowledgeable and entertaining and caters the class to everyone's experience and desires. He can also teach the class in Spanish, English, or both if you'd like. Go do it!"

Who knew that learning to ride a polo pony and getting enough rudimentary skills in the sport to actually play a \u201cmatch\u201d could be one of the most exhilarating activities of my life? Apparently, all of the folks who left comments on Trip Advisor about excursions with Polo Elite, and I\u2019m so glad I took their recommendations to heart. My husband and I booked a day with Fernando a few weeks before arriving in Buenos Aires. Out of all of the activities we had planned, I was most looking forward to polo; I am a horse lover from way back, and the idea of actually learning about and attempting a sport few tourists have access to was very compelling \u2013 a unique opportunity for something different.The day did not disappoint \u2013 in any way! Fernando met us and our three fellow adventurers at the appointed time and destination. Within moments of meeting Fernando, we were all at ease and talking about our travels and our excitement for the day\u2019s events.On our way out of the city, we had an introduction to another unique event in Buenos Aires: protests that closed a major highway down. Taking it in stride, Fernando explained this interesting cultural phenomenon as he found another route to the stables. When we arrived, Fernando started our polo education by introducing us, sans horses, to what we should and should not do once we were astride. Next he demonstrated on horseback the skills he would later ask us to practice. Then, we were introduced to our \u201cassigned\u201d horses and were given plenty of time to get comfortable riding and handling the reins. Some of us had ridden before, and some of us had not. Fernando was a great teacher with us all, and his horses are so well-trained that even the first timers were having fun in no time, practicing the skills that Fernando had demonstrated. Next we were given the mallet and shown how to properly strike the ball; Fernando then gave us time to practice moving the ball up and down the field in an attempt to make a goal. It wasn\u2019t long before I had fallen in love with the action of the sport; it was a challenge to maneuver the horse, coordinate that with use of equipment and keep physical and mental balance. But more than anything, it was just purely exhilarating! My husband, who had only ridden twice before, was thoroughly enjoying it too.After quite a bit of practice time, we all took a break, then we were back on board to learn the rules of the game and try our newly acquired skills in an actual match. I have never had so much fun! As the only female rider that day, and a competitor at heart, I was determined to put in a good show, and Tango (my horse) and I certainly found our rhythm that day. Through it all, Fernando was an excellent teacher and coach. He made sure that horse and human alike were well cared for during the activities of the day.I can\u2019t write enough about what a great time my husband and I had spending the day with Fernando, our fellow travelers, and the polo ponies. It is an experience I will never forget and one that I would recommend to anyone with a hankering to try something different, yet so quintessentially Argentinian. Thank you Fernando!

We were a little worried because neither of us has any real experience with horses, but Fernando was very patient with us, and we were totally fine.. The horses are very gentle but extremely responsive, and they are actually competitive polo horses which made the whole experience that much better.. It was a totally unique experience for us and its not something we could do at home. We both had a great time and would definately recommend doing this for anyone who is in BA! Thank you Fernando!"

He arranged the tickets and accompanied us on a beauftiful Sunday afternoon to the Argentine Open quarter finals at Palermo. What a terrifc time we had, soaking up the sunshine and mingling with the polo set. The atmosphere and setting was superb. The polo was exciting to watch. The following Wednesday, Fernando transported us to his polo club's practice fields, about 45 minutes outside BA. We thoroughly enjoyed a polo lesson, lunch and a couple of chuckers. Fernando's instruction was great and his ponies extremely well behaved. Overall it was great fun and both days were among the highlights of our trip to Argentina. You definitely don't have to have ridden a horse before but after a polo lesson with Fernando you will become hooked on polo and will want more."

I could ride a horse at all, but due to Fernando's instructions I managed quite good. Playing or trying to play the game :) afterwards was excellent fun. If we return to BA I would definitely do this again."

It was a superb day and a highlight for all of us. We are sailors and I describe it this way: think Royal Yacht Club but with expansive lawns and ponies instead of an ocean and boats. The match was exciting - you don't have to be into horses to enjoy the sportsmanship and excitement of the match. Fernando, a polo player himself, was a great host/guide and was able to explain all the rules to us. It didn't hurt that the champagne and single malt scotch was flowing after the match! I recommend this to everyone who visits Buenos Aires."

My two sons (both 13) and I met at the designated place at 2:30 pm where Fernando and about four other people who signed up were waiting for us. We boarded a nice van and drove to a club about 45 minutes outside of town.When we arrived Fernando provided us with all the needed gear and rules for play. Given the number of people, he broke the group into two to give enough personal attention. Later, we played a game.We even took a break midway and Fernando had cookie snacks, juice and water ready for us.Fernando is a great instructor and even if you have never been on a horse you will find it to be very easy.A trip to Buenos Aires is not complete unless you sign up for this!This is a must do.We finished the day with a toast to Fernando's great teaching skills and Buenos Aires.We all boarded the van and were back in downtown Buenos Aires by 900pm.The cost was $100 per person."

My partner was not originally booked on the lesson, but when we asked if he could join the day of the lesson, Fernando was more than helpful in accomodating for him. They originally had no spare horses but Fernando went to the trouble to find and borrow an extra horse for us from a polo friend. My partner had never ridden before and although he was originally frustrated with the difficulty of trying to steer, hit the ball and learn to trot/canter all at the same time, he had great fun and really enjoyed playing the match at the end. Everyone got really into it and made a great ending to a great day. Apart from being eaten by misquitoes at dusk!!!Highly highly recommended!!!"

We'd been very carefully and calmly learning the basics and getting the feel for it. But when the competition was on he was encouraging us to barge, hook sticks and really up the ante, it was so much fun. I wouldn't say that we ever got fast and furious, with players of limited riding experience the pace remained in our comfort zone, but we did get the thrill of the sport.Well worth adding to your list of uniquely Buenos Aires experiences."

From the moment he picked us up to the moment we were dropped off for the night, the group was all smiles. We arrived to the place to practice polo and it was an amazingly peaceful place removed from the hustle of the city. The horses were very calm and even the three people with no riding experience had no problem with them. Fernando taught us all how to ride the horses, the basics of how to hold our polo mallet, everything we needed to know to have a great time. The horses all belong to Fernando and he has really raised them well. They are well taken care of and he taught us how to ride without making the horses nervous or uncomfortable.After our practice time and a little rest and refreshments, we played a match between all of the participants. Fernando helped one team, but didn't overpower anyone, the experience was all about us. Everyone had a chance to score a point for their team and we ended the evening with a cold beer.The trip back was tricky since there were strikes going on in the area, but Fernando made sure we got back to Buenos Aires without any problems. The whole experience was top notch and I would most definitely recommend this trip for those who want to experience a part of Argentina, away from the tourist traps of the city."

The match is so much fun! People who were nervous at the start are scoring goals, and people who were tentatively hitting the ball are now chasing after it!All this is followed my snacks and beer - what more could you want?The horses are in excellent condition and are very responsive, so for those with a little more experience can go a little faster. And the club is beautiful so if you are not riding there are a myriad of horses and dogs to talk to.I went twice, and would have gone many more times if I didnt have to leave BA. If you do one thing while in BA, play polo. It is the best place in the world to do it!Fernando also takes groupos to see polo matches.

This was useful as it gave the second group a chance of looking on. My only reservation was that it would have been nice for all of us to get on the horses together as we were a small group. Nevertheless I was given a beautiful horse and had a great afternoon riding and learning how to play polo. I may not have picked up half of the rules/ skills but really enjoyed it and would love to do it again.

The 8 of us split into two groups for the lessons and then played a game at the end. Manchester were thrashing the 'Rest of the World' team until Fernando helped them out! It was a great day and other than being bitten by mosquitos later on in the afternoon I cannot fault it! Fernando is a fantastic teacher and very friendly.Fernando also arranged for me to go and watch a proper Polo match a couple of days later so that I could see how it SHOULD be done - much faster and more skilful than any of our efforts!"

I came to Buenos Aires with no intention to play polo, but several fellow travelers recommended Polo Elite as a great experience, so I decided to give it a try. I had no prior riding experience, and I certainly wasn't a natural talent at the sport, but it was a wonderful afternoon nonetheless - certainly one of the best things that I did in Buenos Aires. Those with riding experience progressed the fastest, but Fernando was a great instructor for all of us. Plus, it was a great get-away from the city! I'd certainly recommend Polo Elite."

We booked this for the last day of our honeymoon and had an amazing time.Fernando collected us in his really nice car and drove us to the ranch where he provided a basic picnic lunch and quick pep talk before meeting our ponies.Then we were slowly mounted on our horses and instructed on how to hold the reigns and crop before heading out to the field. First we learnt to co-ordinate body, arms and leg movements for effective turning - which is very important when you miss the ball as many times as I did. After getting to grips with this we tried walking and trotting around without falling off!!! Fernando was great and didn't take offence at our comedic efforts. He then introduced the mallets and we practised hitting the ball up and down the field without hitting ourselves or the horses!Little break - when the impressions of John Wayne appear - and then match time.As my husband and I had paid for a private lesson it was Husband V Wife. Studpidly I expected my husband to be nice as we'd only been married two weeks, but once we reached 4-0 to him Fernando came to my rescue and we ganged up on hubby. I still lost as Fernando mearly helped and encourged me but the final 6-4 wasn't too shabby. ;)He then drove us back to town were we nipped on the subway to the hotel, showered and changed and then meet Fernando close to our hotel in the afternoon to go and watch the professionals play a match. This was a fantastic afternoon out hobnobbing... and we even got to watch the highlights that evening in bed on ESPN!All in all the day was amazing... I cannot fault a single moment. Although - I do wish I had warmed up a little as it's now 4 days later and I'm still aching."

It was great to get out of the city for the afternoon, head into the countryside and canter around on a polo field trying our hand at hitting a polo ball. Fernando picked us up in his van along with an English couple. The four of us watched Fernando as he gave us the basics of the polo swing, then mounted our horses and went up and down the field hitting the ball. Fernando was a good teacher, showing us bit by bit how to twist in the saddle, hit the ball with either side of the stick etc as the afternoon went on. After a short break we were ready for a match - Australia versus England. We played on one end of the field and scored 10 goals between us so lots of fun was had by all. Fernando joined in too. He drove us back to our hotel by 7.30pm. We were on a high from being out in the fresh air on horses and learning something new."

On my recent trip to Buenos Aires, we carved one day out of our 4 day stay to spend learning polo with Fernando - it was such a wise choice. Despite never having ridden a horse before, we had such a fun day learning to ride and the fundamentals of polo. Fernando was a great instructor (though he made things look too easy!) and there was never a dull moment. The highlights:- Getting to see a little of the Argentina country side (not just the city) without a long drive- Feeling comfortable and safe throughout the day, despite little to no previous experience- Laughing all day long with my friends as we try to play a polo match at a walking paceBest of all, the experience was well worth the cost. Unlike the tours we did in Rio that cost $60 USD for an hour on a boat, we spent the entire day with Fernando at a very reasonable price, including lunch and snacks."

I am in the fortunate position of working in Argentina on a 28/28 rotation and therefore can take my time sampling the various attractions on offer here in BsAs. I am really interested in taking up polo when I am back to the UK (we live a few miles away from Taunton Vale Polo Club, 2nd oldest in the UK), so I started looking round TripAdvisor for ideas.I wanted something that was a fun introduction to the sport, not too serious or elitist. So I was really happy when I found the current Number 2 of all BsAs attractions here on TA is Fernando Nieto of Polo Elite, with a lot of reviews suggesting he would be ideal. A quick email and a phone call and we were all set up for a private lesson.Fernando arrived at my hotel in Microcentro in his new Hyundai people carrier exactly on time (he is always punctual.....BsAs traffic allowing). We headed to the Tristan Suarez Polo Club out past the international airport (a journey that takes around 45-60 minutes). When I arrived, other club members were having a few practise chukkas and it was immediately clear that this isn't a glossy showcase operation, but a true slice of Argentinian life. I immediately knew I had come to the right place. Everyone is really friendly and welcoming and are happy to show you their great sport. I have had a few lessons now and have got to know some of the regular players and the head grooms Andreis and Umberto. Fernando got into polo 3 years ago and is currently a 2 goal player (although I suspect he could be higher). This, plus his excellent english, easy going patient nature and the fact that he has also until recently been teaching graduate and post grad business students, makes him a very good ambassador for polo. As others have said here, the school ponies are incredibly patient, they are very tolerant of a beginners faults, yet they can also show as much speed as you can safely handle and are ideal mounts. To the reviewer who was a bit uncomplimentary, I have used one of Fernandos personal ponies and its like passing your driving test and being given the keys to your Dads Porsche...amazing acceleration and incredibly responsive....but also not a place to be making mistakes (you wouldn't want to fly home in a plaster cast with a big medical bill would you?)You will have a great day out that is relaxed and a lot of fun. After some empanadas and a Quilmes you will get dropped back to your hotel having had a great day out of the city, a bit tired, happy and probably in need of a soak in the bath, having woken up muscles you didn't know you had.I can thoroughly recommend Fernando and Polo Elite; he is a great ambassador for polo and Argentina and he deserves a 5+star rating. I wish him every success in developing his business."

The ponies may look a little shaggy in their winter coats but they are so well trained and fun to ride that the two non-riders in our group had a great time, they even scored the goals! Polo is especially easy if you play golf or hockey (or anything involving a long stick and ball), and the more experienced riders will love the challenge and darting around the pitch on the ponies. One tip - bring insect repellant and apply it towards the end of the afternoon as I got bitten to death by Mosquitoes (non malarial) in the early evening!"

I booked polo with Fernando prior to traveling to Buenos Aires based on high ratings on TA. Our trip to BA included my sister, two nieces, and my daughter. My brother-in-law grew up in BA so my sister and nieces have traveled there many times. Although they were my tour guides, they had never heard of Polo Elite. We all had a fabulous day with Fernando playing polo. He was professional and responsive to my multiple e-mails prior to the lesson. He picked us up at my sister's apartment in BA in his new van. After picking up 4 more passengers (lovely British college graduates traveling for a gap year), we drove 45 minutes out to the polo farm. We were all impressed with Fernando's efficiency and certainly his patience with us. Of the 7 people taking the lesson, one had never been on a horse before. The rest of us had various ranges of riding experience. Fernando separated us into two groups and efficiently explained the basics of riding and polo, then we were off to the field for some practice. After our lesson, Fernando whipped out beverages and snacks, then we all mounted again for our brief game of polo. The game was the most fun for our group. Even the first-time-rider, who took a couple of spills during the lesson, relaxed on his horse and got into the spirit of the game. The horses are a bit tired (but why would they use young spirited horses for masses of tourists and beginning riders). Fernando was such a wonderful teacher and professional. He followed up via e-mail the day after our experience with a kind note and pictures he took of us during the game. The cost was very reasonable for all included (transportation, lesson, game, beverages....). I would recommend Polo Elite to any and all traveling to BA."

We were picked up from downtown Buenos Aires and driven about an hour out of the city to a beautiful Estancia. Having never ridden a horse before, I was a little aprehensive and didn\u00b4t expect to play much polo. After a short demostration by Fernando, I was on horse back and 15 minutes later, I had a polo stick in hand. We spent a lot of the afternoon riding up and down the polo field hitting the ball along as we went. After a lovely afternoon tea of coffee and biscuits we split into teams and played a game of polo. Just when I thought it couldn\u00b4t get any better, Fernando cracked open a bottle of Quilmes (the local beer) to celebrate our game.The whole day was incredibly fun! Such a fantastic experience...in fact, I plan to do another lesson when I come back to Buenos Aires at the end of the year.In my opinion, this is a compulsory Bs.As experience...Tango & Polo!"

He was very patient and extremely nice. I can't say we were the best polo players for sure, my horse even got annoyed with me for being too slow and decided to plop down for a rest, but it was just so much fun learning to play and then having an actual match. My friends and I are a pretty competitive bunch and noone likes to lose- we were hooking, nudging, and whacking that ball as best we could. At the end of our trip we all thought it was the best experience we had during the trip, largely in part to Fernando and his patience and general amazing-ness. He even took pictures during the match and sent them to us after. We heart Fernando and Polo Elite!"

Fernando was very helpful keeping us updated on the timings and options, in the end we had a private lesson and day out. Fernando arrived spot on time at our hotel and navigated the challenges of BA traffic to take us to the polo terrain (approx 45 mins). There are 2 polo fields and during the day there were experts practising polo. There is plenty to observe with people working on the farm.Unlike lessons in England where you spend the first hour standing on a crate learning to swing the mallet, you get kitted up and on a pony in the first 10 mins. You familiarise yourself with the horse, then try to balance use the reins and whip with your left hand before graduating to the holding and swinging the mallet. Fernando is very patient and you can go at your own speed. After practising there is a lunch of empanadas followed by a mini 'match'. Fernando explained the rules and we battled it out with lots of hooked sticks and being ridden off the ball. In our case, it was not the sport of kings, but we had great fun. We had a great day out. Fernando was a wonderful host. Recommend to all looking for an active day in BA!"

The experience was well divided to familiarize us all w/ each of the components we'd need to know to play an actual game- we first spent time on our horses in the field riding around, getting familiar with them and them us. Next part was introducing the mallet and the proper technique and rhythm to hitting the ball. We practiced this up and down the field with Fernando constantly encouraging us and engaging every one in the game. After a short break, we put it all together and actually got to play a game. First team to score 6 wins....sounds easier then you think, especially after Fernando showed us the defensive moves of the game- hooking, blocking, etc. and remembering there are also rules! Ted and I have already discussed our next visit to BA in the summer and talked about returning for another opportunity to have some fun with polo.It was definitely an experience I would hope everyone could have, one that you do not want to miss:)"

We were divided into two teams and he patiently helped us learn a few basic techniques. After a break with some really good empanadas, we actually played a match.

Plus, they speak English, so for those of us who are novice spanish speakers it creates a more hospitable environment where you don't have to worry about the language - and they are extremely friendly!!! Once you get there, you first practice riding the horse so you feel comfortable and then they teach you the proper way to hit the ball. I've gone horseback riding before but never played polo so it was alittle intimidating trying to lean over to hit the ball but after five or six times you get the hang of it. Once you do, all you do is get better and better and by the end of the experience you feel like you could play in a match. But, if you're lucky, like I was, you'll get to see a real polo practice/match afterwards and realize that you've just scratched the surface - those guys are incredible!!! It's amazing to me - after trying it myself - how fast they're able to go and still be able to hit the ball without falling off.

Polo is a sport with a lot of tradition in B.A and a great activity for every turist. You can look at pictures of graveyards in recoletta on Google when you get home, but Polo has to be experienced. Be carefull. You will want to visit them more than once!"

I\u00b4d had a few Polo lessons a couple of years back, but after my day with Polo Elite I felt compulsed to take it up again and this time seriously...a great day away from the busy city of Buenos Aires and ultimate cure for the hangover...Fernando structures the 4 hour lesson, with breaks, perfectly - a bit of one to one tuition, good drills and a fantastic game at the end between the players to cap off a great afternoon. Great thing to do with mates, my arms were dead at the end of the day, you don\u00b4t waste time hanging around! Only thing preventing it from being excellent is a lack of high calibre ponies, you need to show alot of whip!"

My friends and I were in Buenos Aires for a week in May and after reading all of the wonderful comments on TripAdvisor about Polo Elite, I contacted Fernando and set up a day of polo. Fernando and his dad picked the 5 of us up at our hotel in Recoleta and drove us out to the country for what was by far the best day of our entire trip! We had all been on a horse before but were by no means experts. Fernando was great about making us comfortable on our horses before our actual lesson began. We spent the morning learning the basic techniques of how to play and by lunchtime we were having so much fun. Fernando was so patient, which I think helped us all pick it up faster.We went on a Wednesday so after lunch we were able to watch the local teams play a few matches which was so exciting. We sat right on the side of the field and after 2 matches Fernando had us get back on our horses so we could play our own game. We had so much fun and really got into it. Nothing beats playing your first polo match with the sun setting in the background!My only regret is that we didn't have more days to go back and play again. I highly recommend Polo Elite to anyone looking for something different to do while visiting Buenos Aires. If I ever make it back to Buenos Aires I will definitely be contacting Fernando for another amazing day of polo!"

He had us practice walking and cantering the horses until we felt comfortable. Then he gave us a lesson on how use the polo sticks and we practiced hitting balls while mounted on the horse (usually at a walk or trot because we were just getting the hang of it). Then, he taught us the basics of the game and we played a game. It was the most fun I've had in a long time! Fernando was a great teacher and so patient with us.

I had wanted to learn but it was prohibitively expensive. So I was surprised to find that we could learn, on a backpackers budget, in the home of the sport in Argentina. Fernando was incredibly helpful, picking us up from downtown BA, and taking us to his club. It was incredibly enjoyable watching his team practice first (as it was Sunday) - giving us a taste of what we should be doing. Then we were on the horses and started our lessons. It didn't matter that my partner was a non-experienced and nervous rider. We started our lessons at a walk, and pretty soon, my partner and I were concentrating on the ball rather than the horse. This means the horse just goes to where you want - including chasing after the ball when they see it. They are also so bomb-proof - they don't care about getting hit by the ball, or a stray mallet or charging into each other. Our NZ versus Argentina matches were also fun - and a really good way to learn the rules of the game, even if it was at a walk most of the time (don't worry you can go as fast as you like). Would definitely recommend Fernando, and his team at polo elite for a great day or few days in BA."

A private Polo lesson was recommended to us by one of the local bartenders. This turned out to be a perfect way to spend the afternoon. Half of our group had only been on a horse once or twice before, so the name Polo Elite was a bit intimidating at first. Our teacher did a great job of walking us through the basics though, and by the end of the lesson we all felt very comfortable. At the end, we were divided into teams, and played a game. After our game, we got to see some of the semi-pros who belong to the club play. They were amazing!! It gives you a whole new perspective on how good these guys are.I looked up prices for a Polo lesson in San Diego to see how the price compared.

We wanted to experience as much of the culture as possible. We saw an ad for Polo Elite in one of the hostels and just had to do it. This couldn't have been a better idea. Fernando picked us up at the hostel and drove us to La Tuna ranch, so we didn't even have to find transportation. We had never tried polo before, but Fernando is a great teacher and was very patient with us. We spent the whole day at the ranch. When we weren't on the horses knocking the ball around, we got to watch some pick up games that Fernando and his friends played in. That was cool, to see how the game is actually played, close up. All the guys were very friendly and willing to help out some Americans. All in all, for this price, you can't beat this experience. Luckily, while I was in town, it was the week of the largest polo tournament in the world and Fernando invited us and others to the game. This was amazing! Fernando provided us with, not only a ride again, but knowledge of the game so we could follow it. The game was incredible and we even got to meet some of the winning players after the game.
