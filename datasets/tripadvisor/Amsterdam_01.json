The TripAdvisor reviews were very positive so I had high expectations which I'm pleased to say were comfortably met.Our host was very friendly and set the scene well for our chosen mystery, the Architect. The difficulty level was about right - we successfully solved most of the challenges, with a couple of helpful nudges from our host, though stumbled close to the end.The setting and attention to detail was excellent and really created a believable atmosphere. While more participants might have helped us solve it faster, it should be well within the capabilities of a couple who pay attention to everything being said and -- most important -- remember to communicate everything, especially if separated!Highly recommended!"

The woman conducting our experience was friendly and helpful and kept in character the whole way through. This room had a good flowing story and the puzzles were varied and exciting. We escaped with 3 mins to spare! Really good fun and definitely a good one to do with a bigger group"

After a somewhat disappointing first escape room experience I could not wait for a (hopefully) better experience which I definitely found here in the heart of Amsterdam at Sherlocked. We did The Architect with four people and, with four minutes left, escaped just in time. I really loved the venue which gave the escape room an authentic and mysterious feel. The host was welcoming and helpful. The interior of the room and the puzzles were very well-thought-out: everything matched perfectly together and looked as if it really belonged in that room. The puzzles were challenging but not too hard I think. Since I don\u2019t want to spoil too much, I\u2019ll just give you this: There is more than meets the eye in this escape room."

It was so intense and challenging that we spent the next two days just talking about the experience. Although there is an explanatory e-mail, the entrance is a little confusing, you have to wait for a few minutes at a fairly non-descript door until someone comes to let you in. Once inside, everything was perfect. A lot of thought went into making this an absolutely fantastic experience."

It's an escape room, with two difficulty options, the Architect, and the Heist. We played the Architect, and it was great fun. You'll need to think literally, as well as outside the box. It's great fun. If you have experience with escape rooms, perhaps try the Heist, as we found the Architect a little easy, but it was a lot of fun. Communication is key!"

My enquiries were answered via email quickly. The escape room itself was good fun and our quiz master was friendly and spoke good English which helped! The only down side to this was the price as it was quite expensive. However as it was a special occasion was worth the money. Would recommend doing this as something slightly different!"

            "review": "Terrific escape room in the heart of Amsterdam. Sherlocked is located at the Beurs van Berlage which is a five minute walk from Amsterdam Central Station. You will find the entrance at the Beursplein, next to the caf\u00e9 opposite to 'de Bijenkorf'. Make yourself known by ringing the bell. The host will pick you up at the door and, after greeting you, will guide you to a place where you can leave all jackets, bags, and valuables. All valuables as well as bags are left in containers which will be locked so don't worry about anything getting stolen.After storing your belongings the host will guide you to the catacombs of the Beurs van Berlage and will tell you the story about the Beurs van Berlage after which the challenge will start. We played The Architect, which was absolutely terrific. The room is decorated beautifully with the decor completely fitting the early 1900s style of the Beurs van Berlage. The puzzles and riddles are not too easy and have been thought out very well. Clues provide hints in a very cryptic manner causing one to really think twice. Opposed to other escape rooms puzzles and riddles are diverse requiring the players to use all their senses. Hints are provided through an old fashioned phone in the room. Puzzles aren't necessarily lineair meaning players can work simultaneously on solving different mysteries. We were with five, which felt like an ideal team size. Unfortunately we did not manage to escape within 60 minutes as we got stuck in the last fiveteen minutes despite being very very close. Escaping, however, isn't impossible within the hour, just be sure to stay calm, think clear and retrace the steps you've taken. According to the host 60% of the players manage to escape within the hour.Despite failing to escape we had the time of our lives. Playing Sherlocked is a great experience and I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a great activity with friends to play this game. We will definitely come back to play The Vault! I think Sherlocked really lives up to its promise of being among the best escape rooms in the Netherlands. Hopefully the portfolio will be expanded beyond The Architect, The Vault and (currently) The Port Game."

When we arrived another group was already waiting and fifteen minutes after we were meant to start that group was taken to the room. Ten minutes after that (and getting no answer from the contact number given) someone finally arrived to tell us they had double booked and they couldn't give us our experience that day. It was reorganised for our last day of holiday. The morning of our new experience we were phoned and told they couldn't fit us in that day and we would have to do their other, shorter room. Shorter room was well themed and fun until one of the props didn't work and the guy obviously wasn't paying attention because he kept giving us clues for puzzles we had already solved. After he finally realised what was wrong he had to come into the room and fix it for us. Barely gave us any money back even after all those problems and even though they originally said they would take us for drinks after to apologise as soon as we finished we were given the cold shoulder. Other reviewers don't seem to have these problems so maybe you will be lucky but this was honestly the worst escape room experience I have ever had and the constant problems really put a damper on the holiday."

We are fairly experienced with escape rooms having completed more than 10 if them around Europe so had a good idea of what to expect. However we got very obviously stuck twice and felt it took too long to get a hint from the moderator which left us feeling quite frustrated. We felt the price was a bit excessive. We thought the main room itself was too big and the game would have worked better in a smaller space. Having said that, the props and feel of the space are excellent and there are some very original and lateral thinking puzzles."

We managed to escape but the variety and ambience of the puzzle solving really clinched it for me - an must-play if you're ever in Amsterdam."

It seemed a little bit pricey, after all it's just a room, right? Wrong!....... It's a brilliant experience that lasts around 80-90 minutes (70 minutes maximum 'doing' the activity) We went as a family of four with two smart 18 and 19 year old girls and it was a challenge. If you like puzzles and secret stuff you'll love it. We'd never been to Amsterdam before and there's so much to see but this was the highlight . We have tried one other similar experience but it doesn't compare, this gets 10/10.... Just do it! Thanks 'Sherlocked' you were awesome"

The location was amazing, and really got you into the mood. I felt very adventurous ;-)The friends I went with are \"Escape room experts\", one of them has done no less than 8 different escape rooms. They said the \"Architect\" (the other escape room by Sherlocked) was their number 1 out of all escape rooms they had done. They said they liked the riddles better, compared to the Vault (the one I went to with them), because they found them more challenging. But they all agreed that the Vault had the best location, and that it was one of the best escape rooms they had done. Also, I should say that we only just made it at the Vault and only because we got a few tips when we got stuck, so don't think it was too easy ;-) Anyway, I guess I am hooked now, and I will try the Architect escape room, too :-)"

We had the pleasure of tackling The Architect tonight and give it our highest recommendation for all, but we will focus our comments towards other families with kids/teens. Our children are ages 9, 11, and 13yrs and we had done one \"escape room\" prior to this (the previous experience was helpful, but by no means necessary to enjoy this activity). The Architect adventure is exciting, challenging and surprising in numerous ways that reflect great creativity and originality. Everyone in our family was able to contribute and was entirely immersed in the experience. We would suggest that there be at least 2 adults for an adventure like this and definitely it is necessary that some of the kids are somewhat older (12yrs and above) so they can be more involved in puzzle solving. That said, younger children provide their unique perspective - and good ears and eyes that can sometimes be key to finding or solving something that adults struggle with. This is a fantastic way to spend time together as a family. It requires true teamwork and cooperation. Siblings need to support and listen to one another in order to be successful...and are thrilled by the fruits of their joint efforts! We hope others have as much fun as we did."

Second, the room itself was deeply convincing, and had some highly unique aspects to it that were unexpected. Prior to this room, we only failed to get out of one escape room, and I was really disappointed when that happened (brooding and cranky actually). Well, the third reason this place is at the top of our list is because although we didn\u2019t get out of this one, I didn\u2019t feel disappointed \u2013 this room beat us fair and square. There were only two of us, and we just plain ran out of time. We can admit defeat and we give a respectful tip of the hat to this room and declare it better than us.

The level of refinement, quality, thought and execution are beyond anything I could have expected. The staff was wonderful and performed beyond anything we could have expected. We did both the Architect and the Vault. I recommend the Architect for first time people and if you are ready for the big one, move on the the Vault. We solve the Architect with 4 seconds to spare but came up short on the Vault. However, we were the last people for the night, 23:58, so when the timer ran out, they didn't stop the game. They allowed us to keep going for another 30+ mins and that was great, as we were able to see more of the game that way. Very nice of them to do that and stay that late. So, if you can hang out that long, I recommend doing the last event option for the day, as they won't have anyone scheduled after you then you might get to see more of the game if you falter. I can't say enough about how great this experience was."

It was fun for everyone and all participated in the finding the clues. We also did \"the Vault\", It was more difficult, 4 adults, and they also had great fun. Definately one spot to recommend in Amsterdam. The people are also very nice, answering emails even late at night."

This was a first for us so we were unsure what to expect, but reading the reviews it seemed like fun so we went along... and we weren't disappointed, it was brilliant!! We did The Architect and solved it with 3 minutes to spare... what an adrenalin rush!! There were 4 adults in our group which seemed the right number, too many and it could be a bit crowded, but the main thing to remember is to work as a team. Thought it was the highlight of the holiday but then my partner proposed to me in Dam Square, so it came in a close second"

Our hostess, Tanja, set the background story out with great enthusiasm before we entered the escape room. She was detailed in her explanation and prepared to answer our questions about the mystery without throwing away hints. Then we entered the room and found it extremely well planned and accurate to the last detail. Every last object and mark in the room was put in there after due thought and served a purpose. The antiques in the room helped further establish the storyline - and from sounds to smells - it was all there to get us engulfed in the mystery. The level of difficulty was just right - not so hard that hardly anyone solves it, and not as easy that it may be solved within 15-20 mins. Great for team building or just some fun with friends! Highly recommended, well done to the creators!"

Incredibly thought out, this required team-work and everyone's unique brand of smarts. Perfect for first time puzzlers (like ourselves) the room was challenging but not to the point where we couldn't finish in time! Above all else, this experience was a very fun, unique laugh which also challenged us mentally. This has made all three of us want to continue with our 'puzzle solving' ways. Brava!"

However, we were intrigued and captivated from the moment of the email a few days before to the finish of the game an hour and a half after starting. It was brilliant fun and a memorable birthday treat for my son. It's described as \"challenging\" which is fair, but not impossible! We didn't complete it but came very close and loved the challenge. The staff are great and it's very well done throughout. Obviously, I can't give much away, but the idea is you're \"breaking in\" rather than trying to escape and there's lots of twists and turns along the way. I'd highly recommend this for adults or families with teenage kids. Brilliant!"

For this room I would say 5 stars for sure. For the vault I was very disappointed. The room is trying to be different so I can appreciate the designers took a risk but it just didn't work. There also seemed to be a few red herrings that caused confusion more than anything else. Of all the rooms I've done (over 10) this was the least enjoyable room. In conclusion my advice is 100% to do the architect but I would not recommend the vault."

Since they opened their doors (and locked people behind it) we wanted to experience 'the Architect' by Sherlocked Amsterdam. They are number 1 of Amsterdam for a reason! I always think it is very important that an escape room's theme is chosen because of its surroundings and by what the existing building is trying to tell with its looks and feel. The Architect uses the historical background of the beautiful Beurs van Berlage building in a believable but mysterious way. We played the room with 6 friends and all of us had a part in solving the bigger picture. Without knowing we actually set a new time record!!! We can't wait to play the second adventure (The Vault) that Sherlocked has in store for us with hopefully many other top quality mysterious assignments to follow!"

I've heard that customer service for this room sucks, but I could not imagine how bad it really is. When we've just arrived we noticed that we should call or text some guy who opens the door. After having a few calls and messages unanswered, the guy appeared in hurry to let us in. It was 20 minutes wasted in the cold. During the game my teammate got in emergency situation with his health, we tried to signal the operator but it was useless. He was unreachable. Horrible!Once the time passed we were told - that's all and we should quit. Nevertheless that we asked for final solution (having passed 95% of the quest) - they declined to give us neither time nor solution and asked for payment for the next session (start over).Me and my team are doing quests and escape rooms over the world and it's the first time that we are having such a terrible service. Demanded payment for 2nd hour of the quest, declined to help in emergency situation, made us wait in the cold outside for 20 minutes... The worst experience ever."

My friends and I who have each done 5-7 escape rooms each in all different European countries decided to give Sherlocked a try after reading promising reviews. Sadly, everyone left with a bad taste in their mouths and frustrated with the whole experience. You go in and learn about the impressive story and history of the building, then are introduced to the room. We soon realized the gamekeeper will use a phone to communicate with the group - no doubt designed to help you in the right direction (this concept is used in every escape room we have done). However, what it turned into was the gamekeeper calling us to stop messing with the old books, or stop touching this old item, don't touch the couch ect. We began to dread every time the phone rang because we knew it was to have us stop touching something. It eventually had us tiptoeing around the place.Keep in mind, we weren't being destructive, it's just that nothing is a prop, which blows my mind because I'm used to having everything in the room being fair game to hold and study. When we were done, the gamekeeper was not friendly and seemed generally annoyed with us. Do your yourself a favor and skip Sherlocked. We went to a couple other escape rooms in Amsterdam and had a blast. Check those out instead."

In the beginning I was quite skeptical about such a activities, but I have to say that I changed my mind straight after entering the building. This game made me to feel something I normally don't experience in my daily life: you forget all the real life that exists and enter a place which is completely mystical and so real at the same time. So much excitement, emotion and surprises! (especially this one part, where we all had to make a human chain... but I won't reveal the stuff, go and you will see it :P Awesome way how to experience something new: highly recommended. You will have a lot to talk about after this :)"

We had previously done the architect room at Sherlocked in the past and had loved the experience so we had high expectations, but sadly the sequel room was not on the same level as their first room. Without giving anything away, a number of puzzles in the room were not quite working, the interactions with the guides is via walkie talkie and poor in-room speakers and is difficult to understand and is quite disruptive to the flow of the game, the space is much larger and just does not have the same feel as the first room. We knew within the first few minutes this was going to be a different experience. They are still in the beta phase with this new room, and \"are still working out the bugs\", but fail to mention when you sign up that not everything will be working. Even if they get the bugs worked out, it will still fall short of the the first room (which was really great). If you are in Amsterdam and want to do an escape room try the Architect room at Sherlock, but skip the Vault."

And we were not dissapointed.Originally we booked the new room (The Vault) along with the original Architects room but unfortunately was informed before coming to Amsterdam that the vault wouldn't be ready due to technical issues and our booking will have to be cancelled.A quick response back to the booking managers email and they kindly agreed to give us the exception to have a party of 8 participate in the Architect room together.A fantastically thought through experience, which everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed. Great puzzles and tasks and certainly was above all of our expectations. The setting in the old Stock Exchange building gave it such an authentic feel too.Unfortunately with 8 people we still didn't manage to finish before the hour was up. Our host told us we were very close to the end and we struggled on a particular section which we lost a lot of time on.We all agreed we'd love to do it again and solve the mystery and hopefully next time take a shot at the Vault too.If heading to Amsterdam for the weekend with friends, family or whoever I would strongly recommend giving this a go."

Because we travel alone, we end up doing escape rooms for three with just the two of us and usually we are okay. That was definitely not the case here, this room was hard and you really need at least three people, better would be five. We didn't make it out in time, but we were told that it would be almost impossible for two people, so that's not on them The amount of thought and care that was put into this room is impressive. The types of locks and puzzles varied which is rare for rooms, and the level of communication needed it great. All things lacking in most escape rooms. If you can only visit one escape room, this is the one. I only wish they would bring this to the US, as our escape rooms are terrible compared to European ones, especially this one. Great job, Can't wait to go back with a bigger group and tackle the Vault."

            "review": "Fantastic game - host could be friendlier. Let me start by saying that Sherlocked is definitely one of the top escape rooms in the Netherlands.The room is well made and the location is fantastic. Not only it's right in the middle of the city center but also because the building itself lends to the story at hand. But even more importantly than that, the game play is exceptional. First time player would have an experience of a lifetime while escape room enthusiasts would appreciate the ingenuity. It's not a static room where one puzzle would simply lead to another. There are mechanics involved and their effects are quite a delight and there are many puzzle designs that are outside the box. You'd be pleasantly surprised quite often. So yes, do play this room. Highly recommended.Having said that, the room does have some holes in its choice of storyline. There is not much progression of the narrative during the game which is somehow salvaged by the explanation at the end but still it could have been better integrated to the design. The atmosphere is a bit lacking with the absence of sound and light play but this might actually be preferable for players who are not too keen on feeling too nervous during the game.The puzzles are challenging and success rate is only around 30%. They are not impossible but it might be frustrating for people who are not used to solving riddles and figuring out codes. Some clues unfortunately was made rather unnecessarily difficult as it is hard to even see or hear it clearly. Our team did manage to make it out (with 10 minutes to spare and without any hints given by the game master) but we were told that this was not usually the case and we couldn't help thinking that simply making some clues easier to read and others clearer to hear would help players a great deal.Last but not least, the host/game master could have been a tad friendlier. He never tried to learn our names and did not seem to be interested in finding out where we are from. We assumed this was because he opted to stay in role at all time which was commendable but role playing should not be in the expense of hospitality. When I played escape rooms at other establishments (either in the Netherlands or in other countries), the hosts were interested in finding out how you experienced the room and were eager to connect to you as fellow escape rooms enthusiasts. Neither I nor my team mates felt that connection here.Still, do try the game. It's that good to overlook these inconveniences. If the organizers are able to improve on these other aspects, though, I have no doubt it could be one of the best escape rooms not only in the Netherlands but the world."

I noticed a review here complaining about a 'lack of logic' to the quests and even though it's a bit junior of me, all I can say is 'awww shucks'. Everything's wildly connected here and indeed nothing is spelled out for you. If you're stuck, it's not the game and it's not the host; it's you. We were thrilled every time something clicked with us, even (and especially) after reaching that point of desperation, when you think you've run out of clues. In short; can't wait for their next room and this one is highly recommend!"

The aim of the game is to solve riddles to \u2018escape\u2019 the locked room. Cost is 122.40 Euros for up to 6 players (including paypal fee), and we thought this price was well worth the experience. This worked very well for our group of five friends (aged 28-33). Sherlocked was very difficult to find, as located in a HUGE building with many different halls, and initially we were trying to get into the building from the wrong direction \u2013 suggest go early and leave yourself plenty of time to find the entrance! (it took us over 15 minutes, on top of the 5 minute walk from Centraal Station) When you arrive there is a cloakroom area and a lock box where you have to leave your mobiles and cameras etc as these are not allowed inside the locked room \u2013 in case you spoil the surprise for other future visitors! The hidden rooms are extensive and this location was even more fun than other similar games I've played elsewhere! Definitely recommend if you have a free hour and a half in central Amsterdam."

Further, on several occasions, we had to cancel and re-schedule meeting due to our own planning complications. It was a really bad headache for several weeks but the Sherlocked team went above and beyond to accommodate our scheduling hassles. I mean, really, in a few cases we had to be a very terrible customer I am very grateful that Sherlocked took it all in stride so that our events could be successful. So please don't read this and think it will be ok to abuse the Sherlocked team's kindness and professionalism. :-) I was just very relieved at how well taken-care of we were in a city that is not known for outstanding customer service."

It all felt extremely real! We all got really excited during the game and all my senses opened up. After the game I felt so much energy and happiness, probably because me and my friends had felt so much 'togetherness' while playing, that the continuation of the evening was great too!! Oh and btw: funny thing is we didn't even made it until the end, still it was so much fun and there were anyway so much discoveries to be amazed about!"

Housed in the bowels of the Beurs de Berlage, just next to the Bijenkorf, the team have created an atmospheric series of rooms out of which you need to escape. What appears at first glance to be a sparsely furnished room becomes a labyrinth of surprises, which only you and your team can unlock. Our group of six managed to 'escape' in 47 minutes, which we were quite pleased about until we heard that another group had managed it in under half an hour. We will be recommending the Sherlocked experience far and wide!"

I heard and saw in the review that it's pretty cool activity, and in the end of game, we made it with 3 minutes left!! I can't say much detail about the game, but it's highly recommended activity! Love all the details, the puzzles, stories, and old designs. Everything falls perfectly to get the suspense ambience yet exciting at the same time once uncovering all the clues. Not to mention, the most important thing is I am still mesmerized by this after the game ended and want to write nice review about it (it's my first review, usually I never write a review because there is never something that makes me hooked so much afterwards!!).

We kept the game a secret from our families (there were 7 of us in total) and when we turned up at the venue they were a mixture of scared and excited.

It is based in an old building about 5 minutes walk from the station. Without giving too much away, you are put in a locked room and have to find your way out. It is not claustrophobic or scary and very much like the many escape games you can play on apps. It becomes apparent that you are being watched all the time and there is a phone in the room in the which you can contact the organiser and vice versa. He phones up periodically and offers hints (which you do not have to take if you don't want to) to help you on your way. There is time pressure (for some reason you are given 67 minutes exactly). Everyone can participate and everyone can contribute. First rate activity which everyone in our family though was one of the highlights of our trip.

Teamwork, solving puzzles, time pressure, excitement, heart beating in my chest, rushing, amazement.... beautiful location in the historic Beurs van Berlage. I do think that the crew can do something about the hints, some puzzles might need some minor technical tweaking and I would have liked some really intellectual puzzles, but those are really the only small things I can remark about it. Great experience. Really a fantastic activity to do with a small group!"

The room and the great amount of puzzles it contained were created with a lot of attention to detail and drama. For 65 minutes (we had only 2 minutes left on the clock when we escaped the room) we were detectiving away, using all our senses and combined puzzle-solving skills to crack one after the other fantastic puzzle. It's an awful lot of fun, and the feel of accomplishment after solving each puzzle, and eventually escaping the room, is fantastic. We were all first-timers, but it left us with a taste for a lot more. Can't wait for Sherlocked to open their next escape room!"

The location was a bit far from the downtown core area but not too bad in a taxi. The room itself (the Bird Cage) was pretty good - the puzzles were fun and the theming was interesting. We didn't find the puzzles too difficult - but seeing as we had some newbies with us - it was a good room to introduce them to escape rooms. Marta was also really great at giving hints and debriefing us after we finished! We had 7 people in the room, and we did find at times that at times some people were left with not a lot to do so I would definitely recommend coming with 4 or 5 people max. I also really liked that after we finished we all got a beverage - it was definitely a nice way to end a pleasant experience!"

We were greeted by our host Marta, who gave us a summary of how to play the game, then we were locked in our room. We had such a great time escaping the first one, that we actually did the second available room right afterwards.Marta was a wonderful host, and we also got to meet the owner, who is a cool guy as well.

The game itself is very different to other escape games. There is no storyline but a room full of riddles. Different approach but not bad.We struggled very much to solve those riddles and did not make it within 60 minutes but we had much fun.This game is designed for people who like to solve proper logic riddles and its very important to work precise.Big Ups for Fatima who did a perfect job. We felt very much welcome and she took time for a longer chat afterwards even if it was the last slot of the day and quite late already.Thank you very much!"

We arrived 10 minutes early, the location is quite confusing and middle of what seems like a business park. We saw a small sign saying to ring the phone number to be collected. Our guide was Fatima who was really lovely and informative. We sat in a room with mini games and sweets in, we were then explained all the rules of the game and given a walkie talkie. I won't say what's in the room so it's kept a surprise but it's REALLY fun. It makes you use your basic skills and work as a team. You can use the walkie talkie if you get really stuck to get some extra hints. Unfortunately we ran out of time and went around 5 minutes over the time, we didn't give up and finished the game which was very rewarding. Fatima bought out a mini cake and a candle for our friend and we sang him happy birthday and then we were given props and 1 soft drink and had our photos taken. It was such fun and I would defiantly recommend you do this when you visit Amsterdam!"

First of all - Fatima was an excellent host at Room of Riddles!After few rules and a short chat we got into our room (the little bit harder one I was told).And the clock starts with 60 minutes. First time I looked we had wasted 15 minutes.Second time I looked we had spent 30 minutes.With about 2 minutes left we got out of the room. It was one of the fastests hours in my life. Room of Riddles felt a little bit different than other room escapes we've done. But it was just as excellent or even better.My tip to others - do not be afraid to ask for help from the host. And yeah - the place is located in a office building and you have to call when you arrive.If you have the possibility to visit Room of Riddles, do not hesitate to book it for your trip."

He loves puzzles and riddles, so we thought this might be something fun and different from all the museums and historical sites we've been dragging our kids to. Room of Riddles turned out to be just that! We had a 5pm reservation and were done in time for dinner, so it's nice that it doesn't take the whole day. Location is a bit outside the center of town, but an easy street car ride and short walk to a nondescript office building. There's no doorbell, so you have to make a phone call to be let in, which can be inconvenient as an international traveler. Luckily, we arrived at the same time as another group, so we didn't have to deal with this part. We were greeted warmly by Marta--our excellent puzzle mistress. She gave us a thorough briefing in a conference room before showing us into the Travelers' Room (for beginners). I don't want to give away too much, but, for one hour, our family of four was locked in a room. To get out of the room, we had to work together to follow clues, and solve various riddles and puzzles. Our team was made up of 2 adults (we both have PhDs, which didn't help), a 13 year old boy, and a 9 year old boy. We barely made it out in time, and only because our puzzle mistress gave us subtle yet helpful hints at the end (She was able to communicate with us over a walkie talkie). Afterwards, we met up in the conference room again for soft drinks, treats, and photos. It was fun to hear from the other group about their experience with the more advanced Bird Cage room. Everyone was giddy from the experience, especially our 9 year old birthday boy. He wants to plan our next vacation to Barcelona because a Room of Riddles is supposed to open there. This was a fun and refreshing activity, highly recommended for families looking for a museum break!"

We used tram 2.We went as a pair, 60 mins is the perfect amount of time. We weren't brilliant at it. We needed lots of help from Marta (thanks again Marta!) but we still managed to solve some of the clues by ourselves and none the less had a lot of fun trying.It's a bit expensive so budget for it and book in advance. The only thing I would add, you need to call them to get in. We found the building (modern green glass office type) very easily thanks to a helpful tram conductor and clear road sign, but it would have been better if there was a poster or sign for Room of riddles outside the building, but even more so a doorbell! Having signal on your phone etc is vital to get in. Not very helpful for tourists paying a phone bill abroad.Otherwise fab! You should go if you fancy doing something different that not all your friends will have done in Amsterdam."

I play quite a few escape games when I'm chilling out, so when I saw this advertised on here under 'things to do' I thought it would be quite cool to play in real life. Was booked solid but they contacted me the day before to tell me a space had become available which was great.Originally booked The Birdcage but ended up doing the Traveler's Escape as our guide Marta suggested that for just two people it might be better suited, so I don't know what the Birdcage is like but the one we did was fun. The game itself is very well thought out & plays through in a good, logical order and Marta was helpful with only a couple of questioning type hints at what seemed like the exact right times for her to comment as we must have looked like we'd gotten stuck, so 10/10 for her guidance and friendliness over the entire time we were there, thank you. :0)Only thing that was a little disappointing was when you get there was there's no great way to tell them you've arrived if your phone doesn't work/has no signal, especially as it generally costs a fortune to call when you're abroad, so a buzzer/doorbell or summat would be handy. We sort of wandered around and eventually found it, and no-one else in the building seemed to know who they were to direct us, but it's a minor point that hopefully they can sort out. To be fair, it does say in the confirmation to email them prior if calling might be a problem, but I was too busy holidaying to read it in full. :0)All in all, a little out the way, but a fun couple of hours which I think even my skeptical girlfriend enjoyed more than she thought she would.Go Team Black!! :0D"

            "review": "Not the best room in Amsterdam. My husband and I visited Room of Riddles on a long weekend in Amsterdam, as well as The Escape Room Experience and TimeTrip (see my other reviews, TimeTrip was by far the best).Room of Riddles is fun, but is very different to other rooms I've done. We did the Birdcage room, in which there isn't a cohesive or consistent theme. It's nice when there's a 'point' to escape rooms, like you're escaping a prison or stealing blueprints or going on a medieval quest...Room of Riddles is literally JUST a room full of riddles, without a connecting theme.As another reviewer has mentioned, the Birdcage room is also full of 4-digit combination locks. This is extremely frustrating, as every single time you solve a riddle to get a 4-digit code, you have to try it in SEVERAL locks, which is incredibly time-wasting. There are also a couple of riddles that only one person can participate in. This was frustrating enough as a group of two, and I can imagine it really impeding and annoying a group of 3 or more.Finally, the location is a little out of the way as well. We spent around 25 minutes on the tram from Centraal station, and there's really not much going on around in the area that Room of Riddles is located. The game is in an office block, so you have to phone them up on your mobile and someone comes to collect you from the foyer. This can be tricky for overseas visitors!This review sounds quite critical, but I do think it's worth highlighting some of the key differences between this game and most others out there - if you're looking for a themed adventure style escape room, then Room of Riddles is not for you. The Birdcage does have one cool physical aspect, but is overwhelmingly based on mental and logic puzzles - not so much on teamwork or physical games. We did have a good time, and did get out within the hour time limit!"

We had no idea what to expect before we went but we all left pleasantly surprised. Bare in mind that it is based quite a way out from Central Amsterdam so its not a comfortable walking distance. If you have bikes though you'll get there in no time."

I'm not looking into where there are other rooms of riddles as I had so much fun.

The host was lovely and spent time talking to us before and after, as well as recommending some places to eat at and to go to. It's not difficult to get to in terms of metro but you have to look for a tall building that looks like offices and it's in there. Il be doing one again, a great experience. Well worth the money and much better than some of the non-value for money tourists attractions in Amsterdam.Thanks for a great time!"

I would say that first off, it's very strange to have to call to be let into the building - not too much of a problem but still rather odd. The location of the rooms is in an office building so I guess it can't be helped. Katie was great - friendly, accommodating and helpful. No complaints about her as riddle master! As for the escape room itself, it started off pretty well. We had the Traveller's Room. We got frustrated a couple of times in between as usual with escape rooms but with the hints' help we managed to get through in about 45 minutes. However, in hindsight we all realized that other escape rooms we had tried were so much more challenging and fun. Something about this room just felt too simplistic - some more complications or plot twists would have been nice. It was still enjoyable for us though! Good for a first time in an escape room, perhaps. Maybe the birdcage would have been better for veterans like us. Other minor points - The briefing room is nice. You get sweets, and after the game you get drinks as well. I like the fact that they prepare props for you to take pictures with after you complete the game. So the conclusion is that service is great but the room we tried could be better. If they change things up then it would be awesome!"

Room of Riddles was one of the first escape rooms in Amsterdam, but out of the 4 or so rooms I tried in Netherlands, it was by far the least fun room. Pros:- Our host, Katie: she was incredibly nice & welcoming, and made us feel comfortable right away. She did say to us that experienced Escape Room players may find their rooms easy (we did the harder Bird Room).- Overall clean production, would have been better for us if we were not veterans of the genre- Can get to the room via public transit + a short 7 min walk- Puzzles are pretty straightforward and are mostly fairCons- Expensive: there are not alot of bells & whistles or fancy effects here. Just lots & lots of lockboxes. They are all 4 digit as well which means that even when you get a right combination you will have to try it several times!- Decor is pretty plain: lots of quick amazon items, no magnetic locks- Requires you call to get into the building, can be difficult for foreign visitors without cell accessOverall I think the room itself is probably average, but the cost puts it into the 'poor' category - this is highly ranked because it was one of the first room, but they really need to invest some time & money to up their game! Their strongest point is their excellent staff (they always seem to be mentioned in all their reviews)!"

We did the Birdcage game, 7 of us, and it took us almost the full hour to escape (2mins to spare). For us, it was complicated and challenging. Some parts were simple, others parts took more time, but with 7 brains, 7 pairs of hands and lots of different things to explore and wonder about, all over the room, it certainly was not easy! Group members might each feel they only made small contributions to the escape, but those small (seemingly random at the time) contributions, all get you out in the end, and it's a funny sense of achievement! We had fun, and I'd really recommend this game to other small teams that work together, or just a bunch of friends or family members. None of my group had done an escape game before, but I for one am excited to book the next one in Amsterdam as I was impressed with Room of Riddles, and it's quite addictive! Katie did a good job of welcoming and hosting us too, so thanks to her for the experience, along with everyone at Room of Riddles for cleverly conjuring up the whole thing!"

We visited Amsterdam last September and while searching things to do, ran across this here on TripAdvisor. After seeing everyone's fun times had we decided to give it a shot. I think we got very lucky getting a booking for the short trip there, so would recommend getting a jump on it if you want to try it. They reserve a spot just for your group so it's not one of those things you can drop in on. Totally worth it though. In a nutshell, it's much like the name indicates, you complete series of riddles/puzzles to get out of the room. A riddle master can communicate with you via walkie talkie, but only if you are really stuck, so you do feel on your own trying to escape. We had a fantastic time, was fun to see the things each of us were better at than the other too. Wasjust me and my boyfriend this time but I could see this being a really fun group activity or team building type of thing too. If you like puzzles or solving things this is definitely something you should try. I'd never done one of the escape rooms before but will keep my eyes out on next trips for sure. Our riddle master was great too and I wish I could recall her name, but she made sure not to give you too much of a hint so you really felt you were getting through it all yourself. This particular company is run by a husband/wife team, both of which were there and eager to know what we thought and how to make things even more fun. Always nice to have that personal touch. Not far outside the city center and really a neat time to get away from the usual touristy stuff."

We were a bit on the late side but fortunately this was not problem. Our Riddle Master Katie was a great host. She clearly explained the rules of the game and also provided us with just the right amount of valuable hints during gameplay at times we seemed to get stuck. Eventually we managed to crack the safe (in which our key to escape was hidden) in 54 minutes, which is under the time limit of an hour.We were with 6 persons and everybody felt as if they contributed to the final outcome, so I guess this particular room (named Bird Cage) suits fairly large groups. Although the activity is quite on the expensive side we had a great time! After the game we asked Katie for a comfy restaurant and she recommended us Drovers Dog, which turned out to be a good burger place at just a few minutes walking distance from the Room of Riddles.If you're willing to put down approx. EUR 20,- pp, this is a great attraction to practise your detective skills and have a great time while doing so!"

The Riddle Master was very happy and answered all of our questions and even showed us a glimpse of the Bird Cage room which made us want to come back to do that room. It had a ball pit!!

The building is around 50 meters backwards comparing to the bus stop. It's an offices building with green-ish glasses on the left side of the road (on the other side there's a canal, so).The girl who picked us up and explained the game was very very kind, and after the game she dedicated us a lot of time to give us some advices about places to see and things to do in Amsterdam.We managed to escape in around 44 minutes and I liked it at the point I would do it again to see what's in the other room."

They lock you in a room with a bunch of clues, and you have one hour to discover the way out. It's called an escape game. If you've ever played computer games like Myst you know what it's like, but you don't have to be a computer game player to enjoy. The woman who ran our session was especially nice, even though she may have been a bit less forthcoming with her clues than I wanted her to be. Fun for everyone."

I wont give too much away, other than to say how worthwhile it was! it was our first escape room experience and we managed to solve all the riddles and get out!

I saw Room of Riddles on trip advisor and as we both love this sort of thing I thought it would be a fun activity we could attempt together. Only a few slots left available so grabbed a 7pm slot. It was dark so the colour guidance to which building did not help nor did the wrong directions from a local man on a bike... when you come out of the metro it is immediately over to the left on the opposite side of the road, 1 min walk! We rang and soon got guided to the right place and we had a drink waiting for us on the table. We were early but Fatima was so welcoming we felt at ease immediately. We had never done this sort of thing before and were a little nervous. We were against another couple in the opposing room to add a little edge to the challenge. We were given snacks and told of the rules very clearly. Off we went and shut in the room. We soon got the gist of play and if we needed a ruling were able to ask for clarification via the walkie talkie. With 9 minutes to spare we let ourselves out and Fatima congratulated us with more drinks. We thoroughly enjoyed our time and had a sneak preview of the new room being constructed. We hadn't eaten so Fatima went out of her way to ring a restaurant to check availability and we were able to have a lovely meal after our puzzle fun. I recommended to our hotel that they should advertise Room of Riddles and would recommend anyone to have a go. More than happy to answer any questions. We plan to revist from the UK when the new rooms are up and running just to have another challenge and to support this great venture."

Unsure of what to expect we headed up stairs to meet our Riddle master (Elizabeth) she was lovely :). She explained all the do's and dont's of the game, we signed a wee disclaimer and then headed to the room to be locked in! As for what happens in there well that's a secret but we had brilliant fun involving great team work. I will say we did manage to escape with 23.57 minutes left so we were all really pleased. We sat and chatted following our escape and the Riddle master helped us look online to sort out where we were headed off to next, she even took us outside to show us where to get on a tram to head into the city centre.I would recommend as soon as you have booked your flights book this game as it gets booked up really fast. We were lucky to keep checking on the website and eventually a time slot opened up as initially it was fully booked and we were quite gutted as it was on our MUST do list. 100% recommend to anybody travelling to Amsterdam"

I am too old for visiting a fair attraction, so the ad from Room of Riddles appeals to me.The first surprise was, that one needed a cell phone to get into the building. A friendly local helped me out, but be warned if you go there yourself.Then you are welcomed by the Riddle Master as a real guest. She explained the do's and don'ts and the we were on own.I won't spoil the story, but with a bit of help from the Riddle Master we made it in time. Without that, we probably would still be locked up! She gave us the feeling we were the most intelligent crew she had ever had and that made my day.Back outside in the rain, we caught the tram in front of the building to return to our hotel.We were so pleased with ourselves....:-)"

It was very well thought out and ran seamlessly. Fatima, our riddle master was very friendly and gave us hints when we struggled to find clues. She also recommended some other great attractions in Amsterdam and was in great spirits. I would recommend this to everyone!"

We had no problems with the booking or getting there. If you look at google-maps before going there - you can see it's right next to the metro and tram, it only toke 30min. from our hotel (in centrum Amsterdam). I was a bit worried - didn't know what to expect and it was a little expensive. But it was such a great experience, a rush looking for all the codes and time went by quickly! The riddle master was a lovely, friendly and outgoing girl, she was extremely helpful both with the 'game' and after about getting to other attractions in area, with her references!"

Fairly challenging, but given a few clues along the way, it's a good test of your logical thinking. We managed to get out with just a few minutes to spare! This game is probably best done with a few more people than 2 to aid with finding clues but we just about managed as a couple! Our riddlemaster (Violet) was great and helped us along the way when we needed it. She was especially great after the game giving us a few tips and advice about where to go and what to see in Amsterdam! Well worth a visit if you're interested in something a little different and 'off the beaten track'. Good luck!"

I booked this as something a bit different to do with 3 friends who were in town for the weekend. I didn't tell them what my 'secret planned activity' was so it was quite fun to watch them discover what we had to do. None of us had ever done anything like it before and as such we really enjoyed it. We had over 12 minutes left when we escaped so were pretty pleased with our effort. Had a lot of fun and would recommend it to others (but think the element of surprise added something for my gang to be sure!). Hard to get a booking as it's pretty popular but thought it was very well organised and Katie was really nice, we had good chats with her after. New room opening this month might make it easier to get a booking perhaps. Would be good if there was an option for 2 groups to play at the same time maybe, race each other; I don't think that's currently the case (may be wrong on this). Good as an option to do something a bit off the beaten track anyway..."

Our riddle master, Violet was funny, friendly and charming, and made us feel very welcome. She was even kind enough to give us some tips on Amsterdam afterwards!Only a couple of minor complaints - the location is slightly out of the way, and there are no eating establishments in close walking distance, so please avoid our mistake and eat beforehand! :-) The building itself is exactly how it's described on the website - a green glass modern office building - but it really doesn't look like the Room of Riddles is in there! We initially thought we were in the wrong place, despite the description! Also it was somewhat tricky to get into the building, as they don't have an official bell so you need to give the room a call upon arrival. This was made difficult for our group as we did not have an international SIM card and had to resort to borrowing a phone.Overall we had an awesome time, and would recommend the Room of Riddles to anyone planning a visit to Amsterdam!"

The game is just perfect and could hardly be better.However, our riddle master Liesbeth somehow managed to do that. She created a very nice, fun atmosphere (even gave us advice on bikes, music and entertainment in Amsterdam) and was probably the reason why we felt entertained throughout the 60 minutes. We could've spent the last 20 mins stuck in a riddle , hadn't it been for her hint. She made our experience literally unforgettable.There's another reason for this. We arrived there an hour late and thought that we wouldn't get a chance to play, especially since we only had 30 hours of stay left in Holland. Liesbeth however squeezed herself and her schedule and offered us not 1, but 2 other times to play. So we made use of this and played on the next day and had loads of fun.

Katie was certainly right when she said to think logically, I think the countdown on the clock makes your mind go to mush!It is right near the tram stop so a 10 minute ride from the centre.Will definitely do it again when their new room is ready."

After Niels met us at the tram stop, we could not see the green building at night, he gave us orientation and we were on our way! We wanted to be the best time of the day, so that got our adrenaline going right from the start. It was not easy, but it was challenging! We were second best of the day! Fun for a group or just 2 people. It is well worth the trek just outside the city centre! Go on and give your brain a challenge!!Niels was also very sweet, it was only his second day working there! Thanks for the suggestion about Bourbon Street, music was great and we definitely stayed up late, or should I say early, the day we arrived!"

You need to get a tram from central station to get there but it is only a 2 minute walk from the stop so it's fine! Get your google maps out! Elizabeth was our guide and she was so enthusiastic and helpful! It wasn't as glamorous as the website made it out to be - you're \"free drink\" was a can of 7up. (LOL) but it was the best fun. Me and my girlfriend did it and were in the knots laughing half the time, mission impossible the other half! Really good for a small group of friends or a couple to do. There are two rooms if you have a large group so you can actually race each other! Hope they change it annually as I plan to return to Amsterdam next year and beat my time! Super fun!"

My partner and I booked a place here one evening as an alternative to the usual Amsterdam nightlife and it certainly didn't dissappoint.It's outside of the city centre so be prepared to travel if you're staying there, it's easy to access via tram, metro etc or a taxi will set you back about \u20ac30, it's well worth the trip though.Our host for the evening was extremely friendly and considering it was his second day working for RofR he gave a great introduction and was very courteous before leading us through to the 'room of riddles'. Discussing what you do would spoil the entire experience but what I will say is that it was one of the most fun and enjoyable evenings I've had in Amsterdam, it'll certainly get you thinking, working as a team and possibly generate the occasional argument.Overall it was a great way to spend a couple of hours during our evening, our host was even friendly enough to recommend places in the city centre to eat afterwards and as he used to be a tour guide his local knowledge was excellent. It's an experience I would definitely repeat again if the riddles change in the future and I would recommend it to anyone to try out atleast once."

If you like intellectual challenges in a very friendly environment and do not want to spend too much money, than this is your event. The \"riddle master\" makes one feel at home and explains the challenges to which you will be exposed in the next hour.

An interesting spot outside of the main canal belt and away from your normal tourist attractions and easily accessible via the number 2 tram. Our 'riddle master' was Katie who was very welcoming and genuinely interested in her job and the enjoyment of those taking part. The group booked in before us had not turned up for their Sunday morning slot and tut, tut, missed out on this experience... either sleping off a hangover or just too scared to leave their comfort zone!Will you leave your comfort zone? We did and it set our last day perfectly... What have you got to lose?"

Such an experience and our riddle master was great. Build another room and we'll come again! It's well worth the cost and although it's a little further out than most of Amsterdam's attractions, it's really easy to get to on the tram. Don't hesitate - book it now if you like a good riddle!"

We had no idea what to expect and after having a few difficulties finding the building (it actually isn't hard to find) we were very excited what would happen next. Our riddle master had been new in the business so the owner of room of riddles assisted her but she did a great job!!! Before we got into the room she explained us the do's and don'ts of the game and we got less nervous. The game itself was so much fun and definitely something new and different. Afterwards we had a drink and she told us where to go in Amsterdam which was very helpful since we had arrived only a couple of hours before. They also showed us around - I guess we were the last team that evening. I definitley recommed Room of Riddles to everyone who wants to try something new, it is definitely worth it! And the people working there are super nice which is, in my opinion, very important cause you have to trust them quite a bit :)!"

The 3 of us didn\u2019t know what to expect when we arrived...we even thought the game had started before we met our \u201cRiddle Master\u201d (Violet) because we were at the address of the building...but we couldn\u2019t figure out which number to press in order to ring someone up to get inside the building. There were no signs for \u201cRoom of Riddles\u201d listed on the building directory. You see...I screwed up our reservation. Apparently, I accidentally booked it for the wrong Sunday evening...3 weeks ahead to be exact (perhaps one too many \u201ccoffee shops\u201d visited). I didn\u2019t realize this \u201cmomentary loss of judgement\u201d until we saw a girl walking down the stairs, towards the entrance. Looking like the lost tourists we were, we asked if she knew where the \u201cRoom of Riddles\u201d was\u2014and by our chance encounter\u2014this was the moment that Violet saved me from my embarrassment. Even though she could have told us, \u201ctoo bad, so sad; good night\u201d\u2014she didn\u2019t. In true awesomeness, Violet stayed, setup the room, and let us have our fun night at the \u201cRoom of Riddles\u201d. On an added note, this was also the night of the 2014 World Cup final, which she missed out on\u2014for us. Needless to say, Violet single-handedly made our last night in Amsterdam the best one. As for the \u201cRoom of Riddles\u201d game, like the others before me mentioned, it was great fun and time really did go by in a flash. We were aiming to beat the record (something like 35 minutes)...haha, we didn\u2019t come close (49 minutes)...but we had a great time trying! (Note: this review has been approved by all 3 of us\u2014so it multiplies by 3!!!)"

The puzzles were suitably challenging but straight forward enough to enable younger participants and those without an inclination for riddles to take part. I liked the themed room and I hope that more rooms will be added as this event continues. I would like to suggest some flexibility when it comes to booking confirmation. I absolutely understand the need for confirmation but I would like to see RoR offer flexibility in adding additional group members once the time slot is booked. I don't think it would matter much to the process if you bring along one or two more people after the initial booking as long as RoR are informed via email. I wouldn't count this as a negative but merely as a friendly suggestion for the future direction of the business. I look forward to seeing where RoR goes from here."

We had lots of fun in this room, although it's size.Puzzles were clear and easy to approach, but not easy to solve.The only problem we faced is the size of the room, which is not too small, but more than one part for a room is something necessary to keep you interested for an hour. That and the background story, which doesn't really affects the game.Overall we really had great time!Also - fits perfectly for first time escapers!"

They got so excited every time they'd solve one of the challenges and a clue or key would drop down. So fun to see them engaged as much of our trip is just looking at things. Here we were working together and solving things to reach our goal! Highly recommend. It is challenging --we got out with time to spare not because it is too easy (we played the medieval game) but because they really are quite smart with this sort of thing.

There is help if you need and the odd little hint does assist, if you're heading down the wrong path.At 70 Euros for an hours entertainment it's good value and it's located in a lovely part of the city.

I had heard so many good stories about escape rooms, but not this one in specific. We were very warmly welcomed and were dressed as real 'knights'. After 55 minutes of amazing puzzles and cool surprises, we came out of the room totally excited. I definitely would recommend this escape room!"

We needed to get hints a couple of times which was easy as there are camera set up to watch your progress in the room and the hints we got were just enough to point us in the right direction, while still leaving us to work out what to do.I would reccomend this to my friends as a fun way to spend an hour or so in Amsterdam"

Granted we were provided a few tips here and there, a gentle nudge when we got stuck. Finished 3,5(!) minutes before the jungle went BOOM! =P Left with a huge grin on our faces! On a more practical note, the jungle room does not require you to interact with the room itself as much as some other escape games would. It is linear, and very much of a brain-game. But don't let it disappoint you, the puzzles are really well designed, the flow is great. What's funny is you'll even gain some \"macgyver\" skills you might put into real-life use who knows!

The owner of the place David was incredibly friendly and made our first time experience enjoyable and comfortable. We would recommend the activity for 3-4 people. If you have 5-6 people you could squeeze into one room, but if thats the case, we would recommend that you just take both rooms and split into two teams of three.(This is a great rainy day activity)."

I had a pleasant surprise in trying to beat the clock. It was an unexpected amount of fun, thrill, teamwork and cooperation I did with my lady. Luckily \"God\" (Voice from speaker) was there when we needed him to assist when we needed something more. Shout out to Daniel, he was an amazing host to the experience. My girlfriend and I highly recommend this cool experience and adventure to anyone who enjoys critically thinking and solving a puzzle. Def something I would do again!"

Roomers?) and were looking for some challenging rooms. In addition to TimeTrip we also visited the Escape Hunt Experience and Room of Riddles. TimeTrip was by far the best of these rooms, and was probably the best we have done in Europe. TimeTrip only opened about 3 weeks ago so it's still relatively easy to get a booking - I would strongly recommend doing so if you're in Amsterdam!!We managed to get a last minute booking for our last day in Amsterdam. We booked the Medieval room, and wandered through central Amsterdam to get there - unlike the other escape rooms in Amsterdam, TimeTrip is within a very short walking distance of the city and Centraal Station, in the pretty hipster Jordaan area. It's also close to loads of restaurants and caf\u00e9s, so there are places to go for a bite or a drink afterwards.The Medieval Room was great, and caters well to people that love physical puzzles. It is built around a King Arthur-related legend, and is really on theme. The room and puzzles are of high quality, and it's obvious that a lot of thought has gone into making it fun and challenging. We were given costumes to wear during the challenge, which was a bit fun, and got out well within the time limit.When we finished the room, we asked to have a look at the other room at TimeTrip - which is set in a jungle. Rudy, the manager, said that the room was available if we fancied a go, so of course we said yes! The Jungle Room relies more on mental puzzling than the Medieval Room, and was a bit more difficult as well. We were given Jungle-related costumes to wear for this room as well, and really enjoyed it. I think both rooms would be great for first time or experienced puzzlers, but the Medieval room was definitely a bit more physical.Overall, I think TimeTrip is the best escape room of the three I visited in Amsterdam - and thanks so much to Rudy for being such a great host!!"

The room is great for just two people and we had a great hour.The experience was only slightly marred by going back to try the other room - Alien Invasion. The team had technical problems, meaning we had to be pulled out of the room halfway through, which spoiled the atmosphere.

The sounds and decoration of the room set the atmosphere nicely, and the riddles and clues are well thought and nicely executed [everything was in English, no need to know Dutch]. The staff were very friendly and spoke English well. We really enjoyed the experience and highly recommend this room for anyone visiting Amsterdam and looking for a fun way to pass an hour."

Me and 2 friends, all new to the room escape craze, turned up to attend the 'Matilda' room and we are now hooked on these unique experiences.The room had a highly authentic feeling and was very effective in making you feel like you were in a movie or video game. This is due to the exceptional 'production value' in terms of the scenery and audio that accompanied the immaculately crafted puzzles. The flow of the room is also very cleverly handled, the puzzles grow in difficulty and often require all team members to combine their efforts to solve. Occasional hints allow the flow to be maintained without taking away the satisfaction of solving the puzzles yourself.We ended up completing the room with very little time to spare, it was a thrilling finale and left us feeling very proud of our efforts. We returned the next day to play the other room of which all the above can also be said.For first time players we would all recommend the 'Matilda' room simply due to the perfection with which it crafts it's atmosphere and the brilliant puzzle designs. One try and I'm you will be hooked like we all were don't miss out on this."

Having done an Escape Room before and seen a few whilst looking around Amsterdam, we thought it would be perfect to get us out the midday heat. Trip Advisor and only being a duo, lead us to Claustrophobia. We booked easily online that morning and everything from start to finish was slick, professional and very friendly. The \"Wake Up\" room was incredibly well thought out, slightly creepy at times and challenged us, although hints available when needed. You could not move onto the next thing until completing the one before which was different from one we have previously done. We managed to escape but were 2 minutes over the hour time slot - which they allowed us to finish as only a duo and so close to the end.All in all, a great, fun way to spend an hour! Highly recommended."

I personally recommend doing what I did and taking your upper management for a round of \"Arcade invasion\". The hilarious moments in the darkness will stay in your memory forever.The rooms are not too hard, but not too easy either. Unlike some other rooms I tried before, the staff is very responsive and the contraptions are well designed. The physical nature of the escape room puzzle means that sometimes you will push or pull, or twist something not hard enough, or the contraption doesn't work at the 1st attempt. In some rooms, you can get stuck for 20 minutes because of this. Luckily, this is not the case with Claustrophobia. The rooms are in great technical state and the staff is ready to promptly send you rhymed encouragement if you are being overly delicate with a device. Thumbs up, staff, you're doing great.Since the rooms are fairly \"streamlined\", with relatively few opportunities to get badly stuck, and not too long solving time, I think this might be great place for families or people wishing to start their adventure with escape rooms."

The room itself had a vibe, which added to the atmosphere of the game.We had such a great time, the next day we re-booked and went on to the arcade version of the game.This was a more hands on, gaming escape room, with the key been to find the portal in to the gaming room. WE completed this in roughly 50 min.I would advise, for a first timer if your going for the atmosphere, and like horror games, Matilda isn't scary, but very atmospheric, and is my personal faveroute. If you like gaming, and solving many clues, like both, Arcade room is for you. (Both are really well planned out!)I hope, this persuades you to do a room escape and I would like to thank everyone for the free tea/biscuits up on been welcomed!"

In the instances we got a little stuck, our host was able to offer hints (though this didn't interrupt the game at all) and by the end, when we finally emerged, we were both pumped with adrenaline (and quite sweaty, haha)!

We managed some puzzles quite quick while it took us significant amount of time to do others. We always got enough hints (sometimes from the gamemaster) to progess in the game and it had more to offer than you might first think.

I have no chance to compare myself, but the 3 guys who did escape games before said that the quaility is top notch and better than the rooms they did before.The price seemed a bit high at first, but seeing the effort put into the rooms the money has been very good invested.When I come back to Amsterdam I would love to do Arcade Invasion."

The staff was very kindly and offer is something to drink. First we relaxed a little bit and after 15 min it was time. I did the arcade version, it was so fun. Good special effects and nice sounds. I recommend every one to play escape room here!"

If you are having trouble, they give you clues so no worries on just getting stuck. Great fun and I recommend!"

We only booked the game 43 hours in advance and the confirmation email clearly states \"Note that it is possible to cancel the game on the website using your Claustrophobia account, or by calling us at ......\".

Unfortunately our cruise ship failed to dock at Amsterdam due to unexpected bad weather so I called to cancel on the morning of 31st Dec. I was promised a refund by the lady on the phone. Refund never received. Emailed to follow up and have been told that I was not promised a refund!!! I'm not a liar, I'm a good person, hence why I went to the effort of calling to cancel! I'm 100% certain that I was promised a refund as I even asked the lady on the phone to re-confirm this, which she did. I have emailed several times and now I'm being ignored. I was kindly offered a discount on a future visit but this doesn't help as I live in the U.K. I was told by the person who responded to the email that their cancellation policy is 48hrs. How can I cancel within 48hrs when my booking was made less than 48hrs prior?! Also, no mention of this policy on my email confirmation nor during my phone conversation when I called to cancel. I deserve the refund I was very clearly promised. Appalling customer service. I'm hoping this post might prompt them to stop ignoring my emails and provide the refund that they owe me."

Not only was this clearly the best room in our opinion, several of the other rooms we visited referred to it as the #1 room. Friendly owners, good theme, high production values, different puzzle ideas and good atmospherics. Maybe could have been improved by a slightly different hint system, but that is just trying to find something to be more balanced. All in all a top escape room."

It's located in an unassuming neighborhood that looks like an ordinary building. They were gracious enough to start book a round for us even though we were there after the normal start time. As we had never played a game like this before, the concept was explained to us and in we went. It was a little creepy but nothing overly frightening or scary. It took us a while to pull together and get through the clues but in the end, we were able to get better at playing together to achieve our common goal (getting out of the room). We had a lot of fun playing this game."

The game was very engaging and I totally lost track of time and forgot about everything else. The story develops in a linear way and you don\u2019t get lost trying to figure out what the hell to do next. This is a very important point for me while playing escape rooms.

Although I don't have the best track record for escapes, I've played 15 rooms in 5 countries, and consider Claustrophobia's \"Wake Up!\" among the very best.This room kills the competition in terms of automation and cool mechanisms. It's clear the creators put a TON of effort into the design, and it was so refreshing to have some genuinely surprising actions happen on their own. I find that some newer escape rooms fall back on the boring lock-after-lock-after-lock scenario but \"Wake Up\" was something unique. The host was very kind, and we would love to go back to Amsterdam see what other cool challenges these guys could put together. (Sadly, we didn't escape. Our last few minutes were some major mental gymnastics! But the host complimented our (husband and wife) communication skills, so I guess that's a win!)"

We totally didn't know what to espect. So we were a little paralized before starting. I didn't get that some people almost made it out, until we did (and almost didn't). It gave a few nice surprises. We don't think it would have been good for our nine year old daughter, because the ambiance with the music and other small surprises and the lighting are a little spooky. I was spooked myself from the noice the moment we got out. If your child isn't easily spooked, definately bring him or her, because some parts are probably easier with the logic of a child. Keep comunicating with eachother. It helped us escape. I'm definately hooked now! They are building a second room.... Nice guidance. I forgot my bracelet inside and they called me straight away. I had a very lovely 40th birthday doing this escape room."

Neither myself or my friend had ever experienced an escape room before and we are so glad we chose this one, although we are desperate to do more and worried that none of them will live up to the expectations of this. Another thing making this so unique is the fact it's based around solving puzzles and riddles but not the typical 'lock and key' escape room. The hosts are super friendly, inviting you to sit, drink and eat biscuits and sweets beforehand, while they introduce you and explain the story behind the room. We paid \u20ac75 between us and it was completely worth it. Anyone visiting Amsterdam trying to decide which escape rooms to do, definitely make this top of your list.They are also near completing their second escape room which we have already planned to come back for.."

Even though I was excited, I had no expectation because every escape room is so different. I have played couple in The Netherlands and Asia.Words can't describe the different waves of adrenaline and feelings I went through when I was playing this room (along with the different levels of my mind being blown). This room was \"automagical\" in its purest form. Things that I didn't think could happen was happening. It was basically a small Disney Land captured in a room. I would recommend this to everyone who is interested in playing an escape room. But it might ruin your experience of other escape rooms. This room would set the bar up high. Thankfully Claustrophobia is opening their second room."

For anyone not used to Escape Rooms (as we were), the idea is much like The Crystal Maze that used to be on TV. We were given a friendly welcome, drinks and biscuits, followed by a clear introduction into what would happen when we entered the escape room. Finally we had a chance to ask questions before being taken into the game room, where the host asked if we were ok before leaving the room. At that point the lights went out and the fun began. This was the first time we had been in an escape room, so although I can't compare to others, we found the puzzles to be pitched well in difficulty: they were challenging yet achievable, all three of us were well engaged, experienced everything from hope to despair to jubilation and really loved the hour. The imaginative narrative that accompanied the event really added purpose to its puzzles and an extra layer of enjoyment.Sadly, we didn't quite make it out within the hour. At times we were really challenged to think and got stuck, with the clock ticking this added a real sense of pressure. Whenever this happened though, the Games Master dropped hints into the game for us that never gave anything away, but pointed us in the right direction. When time finally ran out, the host and Games Master came into meet us and revealed that we were on the last puzzle. They took the time to explain what we would have needed to do to complete it and this was a really nice touch.Escape rooms aren't the cheapest hour and a half you'll ever have, however we literally talked about everything that had happened, for several solid hours afterwards, the experience is brilliant value, unforgettable and I'd recommend you to go."

Being an escape game enthusiast I've been to quite a few (20+) across the world (5+ countries), so this review is based on my experience to others.We arrived in a good time, and our host greeted us with a great smile on her face. She sat us in their waiting area, which was cosy, then the briefing begun.Being experienced players (which we told our host) we are aware of the rules of escape games. She still took about 10 minutes to explain us what we CAN'T do in the room. (I know there are special rules, but these were just basic ones) After that she spent barely 2 minutes to tell us the story of the room. I even had to ask what the goal is as she completely rushed the story telling part, and only focused on the rules.The room itself is slightly scary. Nothing bad but lights go off every now and then accompanied by scary noises, so be prepared for it.Puzzles and the game set up was nice actually. They really got us thinking and we enjoyed the surprises built in the room.A few things that really took away from the experience:There was a puzzle which didn't feel logical at all, and the solution even after we got told felt a bit random.On the timer display you can either have the time or a clue. This is a bit frustrating specially closing to the 60 minutes mark.We got stuck with the final puzzle for a good 10 minutes. We actually solved about 80% of it, and we understood how it works. The problem was that we got stuck on 2 minor maths based puzzles. Our game host was aware which ones are we stuck on, so she pointed us to look at the same thing again and again. I must say that we were a team of two and once you are stuck on a wrong idea it is really hard to leave the loop. In my opinion in this case the game host should have amended her clues to knock us out of that loop, not just point at the same thing again and again as we were clearly stuck on a wrong idea for about 10 minutes.She was unable to present a different approach with her clues which in the end came in the cost of our successful escape. (Until that point we were proceeding very well.)In the end we run out of time and she had to come in to show us the final puzzle, such a shame.After the game she took a photo of us, and rushed us out of the door as the new team was arriving. I wanted to re-enter the waiting area to grab some water and rest a bit after the game, even to have a chat with her but she used a body language to make it clear for us that it is time to leave.I would give the game itself on its own a strong 4 stars, and 2 stars for the game host for the above mentioned problems, which evens out in an overall point of 3 stars."

Maybe we're just not \"hip\" Americans but we had never heard of escape rooms before and literally stumbled upon this during our walk around Amsterdam. I have to say it was quite a unique experience, and loads of fun for an hour as we tried to follow clues and escape. The setup was quite elaborate and we were very impressed with how much work he been put into creating this. We will definitely try another escape room sometime, hopefully we can find one near where we live in California. At $25 Euros per person, it certainly wasn't a bargain, but then again, nothing really is in Amsterdam...."

So it is only natural that my bar was set really high when it comes to escape room expectations. This room met it and even exceeded it.Some escape rooms are better than others. Those at the bottom of my list are simply consisting of series of puzzles and locks without a story line and without atmospheric surrounding. The better ones are more creative in their theme and incorporate interactive clues and puzzles rather than just static ones. The best ones go beyond. The puzzles are cohesive with the theme, there is an advancement of story line as you're making progress in the game, and cool things happen, REALLY cool things happen. If you have never tried an escape room before, this room is perfect for you. The puzzles are challenging without being frustrating, the story is well thought off, and the atmosphere is set up to complete the entire experience. This is exactly what you should expect from a great escape room. Just be aware that not all escape rooms are this well designed.If you're familiar with the game like me, I am sure you'd be pleasantly surprised. To me, having played so often, the best joy of escape rooms is not when you finally made it out, it's about everything else that happen before that. This room definitely got that part right."

If there had been another room open after our session here, we would have gone straight there and done it all over again.We plan to visit more escape rooms and I have even been looking into the possibility of setting up my own escape room back home. That's how good it was! Can't rate it highly enough...Go see it for yourself!"

I had previously heard about these games, but never gotten the chance to actually compete in one. Claustrophobia is a well designed, cleverly planned game - that starts out fairly simple but gets a lot more challenging as you work your way through the clues. Time is not your side and slips away quickly, which heightens the pressure and adds to the excitement. I loved the concept behind the game, it kept me constantly immersed in the storyline. I would highly recommend this escape room as a fun activity to do with your friends or family. Even as a team building activity with your colleagues :) Another escape room will soon be launched, so keep your eye on Claustrophobia. Exciting things to come!"

Second, the level of difficulty. This is indeed the best game I've been to; all the rest are way more stupid in means of solving puzzles step by step, and except for the time constraints there is nothing to think about. Here you really have to think (not just rush to find hidden keys for the locks) and most important - work as a team. That's great!Cons. The atmosphere is not so scary and thrilling as in some other games. Perhaps its good when you as with people who are afraid of darkness, screams and blood;) But I've missed the adrenalin part for a bit.All in all. In nearest future, it'll become a must see of Amsterdam. A lot of positive emotions in just an hour of the city center."

There were a couple of things, once we thought it over afterwards, that could have been better, but the actual game was top.Note, this game is puzzle-driven rather than spectacle-driven, so it appeals to me as a game, rather than an experience, though there were some nice effects.Note also, there are some occult elements and part of the game is in the dark.

I dont want to give anything away and spoil your own experience - I strongly recommend you have a go if your in the area! At first I was concerned if we got stuck we wouldnt have a chance but they kept an eye on us (cameras in the rooms) and we had extra clues/hints at times we were going off track. We solved the clue (slightly over time!) But it was the best fun we have had in ages. We got to work really well together and all 3 of us got really into it. At the end it was lovely to get a photo (they upload to facebook), a logic lock coin as a memoir and we were even given a huge amsterdam magnet poster as we are here on our holidays.

All the puzzles made sense, they had an average level of difficulty, things were pretty linear and all the members of my team had something to do in the room.There was also a fair share of technology and the way the story unfolds is quite entertaining.Finally, one of the things we liked best were the giveaways at the end which were really well crafted and made for a very nice souvenir.

First of all this place is a little bit out of the way if your on foot in Amsterdam but one bikes its only a 15 minute cycle. Its also quite hard to see if you go in the evening and doesn't exactly stick out but if to get there a little ahead of time it wont take you long to find it.The introduction to the room was really good with a little video giving you the details of the story and mysteries you have to try and uncover. The room itself wad well decorated with some quality pieces and didn't feel cheaply done at all.The clues are well thought of and linked well to each other, it takes some thinking but if very doable if you work together and fully explore the room.Well worth a visit if your in the area and its worth the bike ride if your in Amsterdam, great for couples and groups of all ages!"

We did it with 3 adults: you get 63 minutes and 17 seconds to solve it, we got out the door with less than 2 minutes to spare. It's a bit out of the center, but just a 10 minute cab ride from Central station or a 10 minute walk from Sloterdijk station. Give it a go, it's fun!"

It was the first time either of us had done an escape room and he was initially sceptical and thought it wouldn't be any fun...he was wrong!! We both loved every second of it. The whole thing was so well throught out and the story was great. I would recommend taking a taxi or using public transport as we walked and it took about an hour from central Amsterdam as it is outside the city. I would recommend this to anyone who has a bit of time and wants to do something a little different from the normal sightseeing. I think it is perfect for couples, family's and groups of friends. We will definitely be visiting escape rooms again :)"

There were 4 of us in our group, none of us really knew what was involved! We were greeted by a lovely staff member who told us what to expect etc\u2026 then we were taken into the room! Its not scary at all, it reminded us of the Crystal Maze! You\u2019re given 63 mins to get out of the room, after finding clues along the way. I won\u2019t go into detail but it was a really fun day out, we all loved it and wish it was an attraction we could go back to.

The room was really well laid out and the puzzles were really inventive, though not always intuitive, or maybe that beer made me a little dumb. I would definitely have given a 5 star review if not for the location. It's way out of the way, we took a cab there and back which got a bit expensive, though I'm sure you could bike it.

The location is not the best, it is a bit far from the centre and you are guided through an open office which felt a bit weird but it is worth getting over this shortcomings.They use a video to tell the story. The video itself felt a bit amateur (I must say though that I have some video shooting/editing background myself) but the idea was great so it still sets the mood greatly.The room itself goes hand in hand with the story, and offers some great surprises and challenging puzzles. They connect to each other and overall there is a good flow for them. The final puzzle and the door opening mechanism was actually one of the best I have ever seen in my escape fan (20+ played rooms to date) career.Only one downside for me: There is no clock in the room which was a bit odd, and in my opinion wasn't a good decision from the designers. At the end of the game we didn't know if we are still in time or we already ran out (they take away your phones as well) which completely ruined the final catharsis for me. (Especially once we learned after the game that we finished with about 10 seconds to spare)There is a nice touch at the end of the game if you escape in time, and the host was very kind to take photos of us and to have a chat, we didn't feel rushed to leave.Overall great room, great customer care, well deserved 1st place."

Initial reactions were dubious, as it feels very unfinished and unofficial, yet once you're in and the story starts (which I have to say was very prompt, despite a slight problem with actually getting into the building!) the adventure really begins. You're taken down to a room and introduced to the story (which may seem corny at first but its all part of the fun), then taken into the room to escape. Without revealing too much, its very surprising! All the clues lead on from one another, it feels very well constructed and one can tell a lot of work has been put in to make it so.Afterwards (having escaped with only 3 minutes to spare!), our picture was taken, which any other company would charge \u20ac10 for, but we were delighted to find instead the picture would be up on the Facebook page. We were also given a small present at the end, quite unexpected!Overall a great experience, well worth doing, even if you only planned on coming to Amsterdam for the drugs and prostitutes"

Ignore the fact that Logic Locks isn't located in the most attractive or easy-to-reach suburb of Amsterdam, or that it's located in a college building with practically no signposting beyond some Post-It notes on the walls and a chalk sign outside. You could even be forgiven at this point that it's all a scam to fleece tourists while they are locked in a secure room.HOWEVER... Logic Locks actually offer a fantastic Escape Room experience. Very well constructed puzzles that could be tackled by both young and old, with clues posted under the door from outside if you are struggling. Our team of three (youngest was 8) didn't quite get to the end in the time available, although we were very close. I have no idea what other Escape Room companies are like as this was our first experience, but I would highly recommend Logic Locks."

It meant we immediately had to work together an get to know each other, which the room is great for. Although it would probably have been easier with friends or people I already knew. Because there are so many riddles and puzzles to solve it means you can not see everything since you have to split. However there was a possibility to quickly look through the puzzles after we were done. The room is not in a very central location and inside a larger complex, but this doesn't make it any less interesting. It is also still close to public transportation and easy to reach by bike from the centre. Also it would be a great way to discover the west of Amsterdam a bit as a tourist.I am already recommending the place to friends."

You need to be clever, work together and communicate with your group to complete the tasks. They will feed you clues if you get stuck but its a great interactive and highly original activity.

It's a shame you can only do it once, since I would definitely go in again if I could. Worth time, money, effort... you name it, it's worth it."

At first all the elements make no sense, but after the discovery of the first puzzles you are getting up to speed pretty fast. The smart and different puzzles makes the room a great challenge to for fill with your friends"

It's so incredibly well thought out and designed that you really feel the passion the owners have put in. It's built around a great story of an ancient explorer lady that drew all of us in immediately. And on top of that it's in a really, really interesting location that's both an event and co-working space and a business school. We met great folks there and enjoyed our escape experience. This one is definitely worth trying!"

Not only is the game very well thought through, intellectually challenging and fresh (the game consists of not only standard ruffles and locks, but also very innovative puzzles). It is also very engaging. The guys succeeding in creating the spirit of discovery and mystery. The 6 of us were totally thrilled with the game and kept discussing it hours after the game. Definitely a must to try out!"
