So if you want to see a tonne of people crossing at the same time, that's the best time to go! Plus seeing from the street doesn't feel as impressive than from above. If you need a coffee cause you had a pretty heavy Saturday night go to Starbucks, that's from where you'll have the best view! If you're fighting against big company and refuse to consume a coffee there, you can also go up (no one really cares!)"

The crossing is at the Hachiko exit of Shibuya station, which also has the statue of the famous dog Hachiko (remember the Richard Gere starrer tear jerker Hachi: A Dog\u2019s Tale?)."

In the movies and photos this crossing looks huge and chaotic, and we visited the scramble because of its reputation In reality the crossing isn't huge. It doesn't seem much larger than any four way crossing you'd find in most other cities.In terms of chaos, we weren't there at the end of the working day and therefore probably didn't get the full effect. We were at the crossing around midday and there were still plenty of people crossing at every change of lights. Nothing I would call a scramble though. We were able to cross without too much difficulty.The classic flashing signs surrounding the crossing are kind of cool. Other than that there are some multi storey shops nearby. They are mostly clothing and I didn't find anything that appealed to me. There is also a multi floored Starbucks with a viewing window overlooking the crossing which would be a good place to people watch. Unfortunately every other tourist has the same idea, and you'll have to put up with their loud talking. Not relaxing viewing that's for sure.There are plenty of chaotic crossings in Tokyo. This one just happens to be the most famous."

The Starbucks @ Tsutaya is out, I think they don't allow you to photograph from there. I suggest you go to the bridge (\u660e\u65e5\u306e\u795e\u8a71) linking Mark City to the Department Store above the subway or go to the 18th Floor Hotel Lobby of Shibuya Excel Hotel above Mark City.

Also if travelling with others make a meeting point in case you get separated, especially important with kids. Say the dog statue, or under a particular neon billboard.

If you;d like to get a view from above go to Starbucks - make sure you go in the smaller door to the left, go through the door and up the escalator - it's quieter than going in the main door.

Just be forewarned that if you go in the very early a.m. (which we did when awake due to jet lag), its fun to also see the intersection impressively empty (but be aware the Starbucks doesn't open particularly early)"

You think New York is busy.... think again! SO...MANY...PEOPLE! You have :60 secs to cross the street. It seems like a long while.. Well it isn't! it goes by very fast when there are so many people rushing to cross. It is easy to get lost!! I lost my brother..Or...he lost me! I'm not quite sure! My phone was turned off while I was traveling so I couldn't call him. So, I waited under the Starbucks while listening to a local group sing a few songs hoping he would find me there. He knows me well.. I love music.. He found me grooving along. After he donated to one of the local \"non profits\" requesting money, we sat and enjoyed the rush from above the streets while sipping on a nice warm drink at the Starbucks as he is a loyal customer. AGAIN...It is easy to get separated as everybody is speed walking and maneuvering their way towards the other side. I suggest holding hands. It was a live area. Many shops to visit. An array of dining choices just a few blocks from the subway/train. It's very easy to get around. The metro system is fantastic! Really simple and to the point. It is hard to get lost as the stops are colour coded, numbered and named in Japanese and English. My first observation was that Japan was very quite and clean. I landed in Narita and made my way down to Yokosuka on the Metro.. Not one person was talking on their phone, listening to music very loudly or playing games for all to hear.. It was quite nice! Also, I found the locals to be very pleasant. Although, I only know a few Japanese words and phrases, I was able to shop, order food and get directions from every person I asked. Japan is one of my favorite places to visit..so far! I can't wait to go back and explore more cities. Arigato!"

I think the Shibuya pedestrian crossing need be experienced both during the day, and at night. I preferred the night crossing as the electronic billboards /advertising that surround the area, the light, is very atmospheric. I like the way this crossing works - it really does say something about Japan, and Japanese people. You have five roads feeding into the crossing, 22 lanes of traffic, and hundreds of people crossing but it all works, happens with minimal fuss, people cross, traffic moves - it works. I think one of the better views of the Shibuya crossing is via the walkway at Shibuya Station, to the Inokashira Line - its free, not crowded, and gives you lots of photo opportunities."

This is an odd cross section of more than 4 roads so they have timed it so all the cars are stopped so that all the people can cross at once. And you can cross any direction you want including straight through the middle. One of the reasons this seemed a bit different is that the Japanese never step off the curb except at a crosswalk and never until the green walking sign lights up. They are so endlessly patient that I began to think maybe it is a law. I was not always as patient and when the coast was clear I might bolt even with a red light. The neighbor hood of shops here are fun to wander around but I got the impression that this place is busier at night."

I believe this is the busiest pedestrian crossing in Japan, but I don't get the attraction as a tourist site. I've made this crossing many times before it became famous. Now the tourists are taking selfies and videos of themselves crossing the street. There is no need to make yourself look foolish by falling to the ground in the middle of the intersection like some people I witnessed in my most recent trip to Shibuya. I don't see tourists doing similar actions in crowded stations during rush hour, probably because it is a much more frantic scence in the stations.I'm probably in the minority, but I wouldn't go out of my way just for this. There are plenty of other attractions and you will probably wind up experiencing this intersection on your way through it."

Having been raised in a significantly smaller city myself, I found it incredibly fascinating to watch the masses of people build up during the red light only to flood the street as soon as the light turns green. I scrambled across several times, and I think that no Tokyo experience is complete without having visited Shibuya Crossing, even if it's just for a few minutes so that you can say you've seen it."

Anyways we watched the light turn green a few times and the sea of people cross but again, its just people walking across a street and some walk outside the lines which make it look more like a scramble.

I hardly see anyone running into each other in spite of the enormous crowd crossing this place in a maze of multiple pathways. There are several Restaurants overlooking this crossing and many visitors just spend their time watching the crowd building up and crossing this place until it is empty for the vehicular movement. All this happen with the precision and discipline that people normally see in Japanese public attractions. Since it is so unique, I also notice a lots of people making videos of this amazing sight."

Order coffee at the downstairs station and take the escalator up. With time and patience, maybe you can score a seat at the bar along the window, and watch the repeating waves of humanity at Shibuya Crossing. You might also see & hear one of the huge trucks advertising new releases by pop groups...you'll definitely hear them at street level outside. The Tsutaya store features CD's and soundtracks like the Tower Records of old...but Tower on steroids."

Shibuya crossing is huge and huge crowds are indeed crossing in all directions, even in diagonals, but it looked smaller than what I expected.

Good experience! Do not miss it, as it is located in an area full of good restaurants (some with no English menus probably...)."

I visited this place at 2100 hrs when the rush was much less. I believe at 1800 hrs to 1900 hrs the rush would be much more and fun to watch"

I\u2019ve even seen diagonal crosswalk markings in Oakland CA. The Shibuya scramble is a particularly large scale Barnes Dance, as it involves five streets outside a busy station. It may be impressive during heavy traffic times, but I was there around 9:30 on a Monday morning, and my reaction was that it was no big deal. I had other reasons for being in the area, but had I made a special trip, I\u2019d have been disappointed. There is an excellent live cam view of the Shibuya scramble on YouTube; check it out to decide if you want to see it for yourself (and to time your visit)."

You get the opportunity to see people from every age range, and the consistency of not seeing people getting injured as it is rare to see people collide each other when there is easily 300+ people walking in just a single street crossing.Also, one of the coolest features are the screen panels that you see when you get off from Shibuya Station. This is something no other place can offer you but Tokyo.For fellow travelers who are willing to travel to Tokyo soon, you are not alone. There is a green van right before the Scramble which is a tourist center, so if you have any questions feel free to go there and ask!"

Since I was already here and didn't have to scout for a spot to view the crossing, why not a bunch of people cross at the same time. You can easily see the crossing fromthe train station (I got off the Tokyo Metro Ginza line). Oddly enough, it was interesting to watch people cross all ways again and again. I still don't know why, but I guess it's just one of those things that you have to experience yourself. Also, getting down there and crossing with a bunch of people (and simultaneously dodging others) is pretty fun for some reason as well."

People say that you get a good view from the Starbucks but that was so busy so we were in L'Occitane.. which is a cafe overlooking Shibuya.

However, when we were here for Halloween it was REALLY packed and that is when it was truly an experience. I remember we were waiting to cross and it was so packed, we were like sardines. Actually crossing the road was fun because there were a lot of people dressed up in funny costumes and you had to try to squeeze past them. The police were blowing their whistles and corralling people back onto the sidewalks. It was exciting. Next time we go to Tokyo, we will try looking at the crosswalk from Starbucks. I wouldn\u2019t say that I don\u2019t recommend the crosswalk\u2026you have to cross it at some point if you are going to Shibuya. It\u2019s just not that interesting. Shibuya itself is very awesome and interesting though. \u00a0I am giving this a good rating because Shibuya is amazing and you might have to use the crosswalk anyway if you are in that area. So if you go to Shibuya for the crosswalk, you might be a tiny bit disappointed by the crosswalk, but you will still find a lot of cool things to do in Shibuya and you'll get that busy, city experience. You will probably get some cool video of the crosswalk if you use a GoPro and selfie stick.\u00a0"

I hope to go back to take another look myself in such circumstances.Lots of people take advantage of the view from the Starbucks that overlooks the crossing, but of course, it's hard to get a seat and you have to buy something - it's the luck of the draw. But we found a perfectly adequate, uninterrupted second storey view from the Shibuya JR railway station. the window is a bit dirty, but the camera seemed to \"see\" through that, and again, the crossing wasn't that busy so the station wasn't that busy.

What seemed to be chaos from a birds' eye view, is actually a normal part of people's lives in Shibuya. One needs to cross that street, even tourists, as we exit tha subway station (particularly for the Hachiko Statue located outside one of the exits). It is a perfect example of an organized mess, as it all starts after the pedestrian lights turn green on all sides for everybody to safely cross the street. We went to Starbucks on the 2F of Tsutaya Building which you could easily spot right across the street if you're standing by the Hachiko Statue. A piece of advice though, you may find people there taking up seats without consuming any orders from Starbucks. Unfortunately, we found ourselves with drinks and food on our hands and no place to put it on. To make matters worse, it got really humid inside with all the people crowding the place and staring at the Shibuya crossing. We eventually found our way to some seats with the kind gesture of some tourists who were sensitive enough to finally give their seats up for us. So if you find yourself in Starbucks solely for the view, do yourself a favor and skip ordering anything. It would cause too much of a hassle and unnecessary stress. You're better off having coffee somewhere else, where you're sure that you'll be able to enjoy it. ;)"

We see it in movies, anime, etc., it's one of the most memorable things that tend to stick in your head if you love the concrete jungle of Tokyo. And for many people who vacationed in Tokyo, it's one of the reasons why the Shibuya Crossing livestream channel on YouTube is quite popular, because people love the area so much. But again, it's not about the gratification but for fans of Japanese pop culture, it's more or less the feeling that you have arrived in the pop culture mecha, Shibuya."

Shibuya 109 is a must-shop destination if you are keen, and I would have loved to see the crosswalk lit up at night, but unfortunately our time in Tokyo ran out before we had the chance.It also didn't help that we couldn't find the subway line we wanted back out of Shibuya; it turns out the one we were looking for leaves the station above ground so you have to climb a flight of steps. After a long, busy day getting lost in the crowds of Shibuya wasn't ideal!"

I doubt there were more than a hundred people using the crossing at any time during the hour or so we were there. Also, the part of the Starbucks building that normally allows visitors to go to the 2nd floor to take photo's was closed and we had no option but to buy drinks in Starbucks and go to their 2nd floor area.

Coming from a country with a lower population density, you quickly get used to this fact, and crossing the street there is a bit of fun, ducking and weaving through the madness. Once through, it's good to view the crossing from a higher point, such as the Starbucks nearby, though this is where most people go to do it, so it's usually very crowded. There's a lot to do in Shibuya (shopping-wise) so the crossing is a nice start."

I am writing this to help visitors who need to get to the Narita Express track at Shibuya station with heavy luggage, pointing out how to get to the elevators which are NOT easily locatable without help or information.I assume you have already bought your Narita Express ticket. At the point of purchase (in the station.ask), they will tell you it is at level 3 track 4.(Remember this)The easiest way is to then go through the turnstiles there BUT it means walking up stairs or escalators.1. Find the statute of the famous Hachiko Dog. (You can't miss it. Ask).2. Face the statute head to head.3. To your left is Tokyu Department Store.4. There are two entrances.5. Take the entrance on the left, ie, closer to the train station entrance.6. Walk through it.7. You will pass an information counter. You can ask again if you want.8. Emerge on the other side and you will see a huge ugly head/face statute on your right.9. Walk strait on and you will find lockers on your right, and then on your left.10. You will see the JR Line information counter on the left in another entrance to the station. It is the south entrance.11. You can ask again.12. Face the info counter and you will see the entrance turnstiles on your right.13. Go through with your paid for Narita express ticket.14. Turn right immediately. You will find a lift hidden but can be found.15. Take it to level 2.16. At level 2 exit and find the next lift which is close by (My memory went hazy here but you can't get lost. It's Japan! Ask).17. Take the lift to level 3. 18. Look up and always, always follow \"Narita Express\" with the aeroplane sign next to it.19. You will find2 sets of travelators.20. You will gradually approach track 4. BUT the first time you will see stairs.21. Take the travelator to the end and you can find (hidden but can found again) another lift to take down to track 4.22. Once on the track, look a the displays above head and it should read Narita Express.23. Wait. It comes, get on.It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to get to the track from Hachiko. So plan ample time before your train timing."

It was raining then so we ended up using the famous japanese transparent umbrellas as well. Tips if you want to get a photo or video from a far?

Although they have every right to be there as well - I feel as though Starbucks should police the use of these spots more strictly as we waited for over 30 minutes while watching a group of ignorant school kids text - not once looking out at the spectacle we had all come to see. Hopefully Starbucks can sort this out as it appears the place is a victim of it's own popularity.

Everyone's got their places to go and people to see and amidst what looks like chaos, it is also very systematic at the same time. Tourist can stop to take pictures and videos right in the middle of the intersection and still somehow get through the crosswalk without getting hit by a car. Tip: There are several places to take videos/pictures of the crossing: (1) the 2nd floor of Starbucks across the street from the station, (2) the 2nd floor of the JR Shibuya station itself, or (3) do what I did and enjoy some warm milk tea and a fluffy pancake on the 2nd floor of the men's Shibuya 109 at Hoshino's Coffee.

            "review": "Crowds, chaos, noise, havoc, mayhem... downright insane! But strangely beautiful and sensational...!. Complete mayhem... what more would you want??? We are people big-city born and bred, yet we found ourselves drawn to this spectacle. And that is precisely what it is - a truly incredible spectacle! Naturally we had seen videos of the Shibuya Scramble - including its adaptation in many movies \u2013 but experiencing it firsthand, on-location is terrific (to say the least) and a \u201cmust-do\u201d for any tourist to Tokyo.On our recent visit, we had allocated a day and night for Shibuya; as the area is in itself an attraction without the pedestrian scramble. That said, we kept being drawn back to the scramble throughout the day and night. From various locations surrounding the traffic intersection, we observed and recorded the masses of people scrambling across in all directions. It was absolutely phenomenal...!Even mid-morning on a weekday, where you would expect the least amount of people, it was mind-boggling. Come evening and night, however, the crowds scrambling across the intersection was... well, words fail me... For us, it was not daunting or negative, quite the reverse... it was downright fascinating!Upstairs in Starbucks (north) or the L\u2019occitane cafe (south-west) are good vantage points to observe the scramble; not to mention being out of the mayhem. Once we had experienced the scramble at various points at street level, we were ready for some sanity. So the cafes were nice, quiet havens to enjoy the spectacle without the noise and chaos. At L\u2019occitane particularly, request a window table upstairs.Lastly, please don\u2019t forget to pay a visit Hachiko. If you are unfamiliar with Hachiko, read the touching story on the internet. What a loyal dog!!Enjoy Shibuya!Thanks for reading this review and my gratitude if you choose to rate it as helpful. No pressure though. Cheers!"

Have fascinatingly seen (on video) and read about this very unique Tokyo 'organised mayhem/chaos' pedestrian crossing, it was not disappointing us!We got off at the Shibuya station, the crowd of many hundreds if not thousands of people was building up on every end of pedestrian crossings! When crossing lights turned green, here they/we go, walking across the roads at our own preferences and didn't bother to keep left or right, no one was hit or crashed onto each other. It was like a chaos or mayhem, but in a very nice and self-organised way! It was an army ants crossing, that all I shall describe!Must try it yourself if you are in Tokyo to experience the operation of the organised chaos. The best way to do, is to get off at the Shibuya station, pay a visit to a statue of the most royal dog of Japan named Hachiko, then do the crossing. After that, It is also good idea to have a cuppa at Starbucks in the upper floor, take a window seat for a short break and continue observing interesting collective human's behaviour!"

There are an amazing number of people and yet everything is executed with such ease. We looked from a vantage point and then crossed a few times ourselves just to experience it. The best time to see this is late evening. Plenty of fun bars etc close by so one can get a drink after."

All traffic stops and you will see huge crowd of people trying to cross in all directions. What a scene!

Sadly the professor died and didn't return home so Hachi returned to the station each day for I think 7 years to wait for him . A film starring Richard Gere has been made about the story ... A real tear jerker . The shops in Shibuya range from high end department stores to individual small shops selling a variety of different things .

Of note is that the green and red lights are very well respected and that you will almost never be hit by somebody else while crossing.

Maybe if you're from some small town (and I assume you've already got a headache just walking around Tokyo in general then), then it may be amazing. But! what really wowed me is how often the scamble happened and how that means so many people cross this single intersection in just one day, heck, one hour even! That was the marvelous thing.

If you want to see something akin to human fireworks and you're in the neighborhood for shopping or dining, exit through the Hachiko gate and you're right on top of something pretty wild. You may have seen it in movies, but here's your chance to experience it for yourself. It's simply the way you cross the street from the station into the Senta-gai shopping area, but that doesn't do the Shibuya Scramble justice. Very crowded as people mass on the sidewalks, the light changes, and then it's a human explosion that spreads across the street. Some other reviewers suggest trying the Starbucks where you can watch the action. That sounds like a good idea to me, although I've never done it. Otherwise, if you're going that way, there's hardly any avoiding it so just enjoy the humanity. Warning, though-- if you're at all crowd-adverse it's not for you."

Although it was raining but I'm very excited since everybody using umbrellas and it feels exactly like resident evil scene (luckily i'm not the one who stand in the scramble center and turn into zombie hahahhahaha) I found the best spot to see this scramble is from Starbucks on the 2nd fl (i tried to see it from Skywalk Malls but it's too far back to enjoy it and too many distraction). The window table is all occupied but the turnaround is pretty quick, plus the other visitors is willing to share their spots when their done taking pictures.

But it is not more crowded than many places in India, China, Korea or Japan.It is really much nicer to walk around, look at the tiny statue of Japan's most famous dog, Hachiko, or visit one of the many stores around the crossing, stand and gawk at the huge video screens showing advertisements, or listen to the buskers."

We asked a fellow traveller and recommended to us a visit to Shibuya. This is about an hour and a half train travel with just a single train transfer at Nappori. We decided to the the Keisei Skyliner train to Naporri and then buy another ticket for the Yamanote Line to Shibuya.When we got into our destination, we just walked into the exit, not knowing where to go, although we know that all we need to do is remember the area where we alighted. We remember landmarks so that we will not get lost since a lot of people in the area speak just a little English.As we walk, we came into the street where the cross walks are all all intersecting and what an experience!! The pedestrians are all so disciplined, once the traffic lights turns red, there they go..people criss-crossing and walking past each other. We just walk amongst the crowd and enjoyed the marvelous scene of people crossing.There are lots of ramen/noodle houses in the area as well. We enjoyed the short visit to the area and would definitely go back there again and maybe stay for a couple of days to explore the area even more."

I visited this intersection on a Saturday night in the rain and it was still busy, so be prepared to dodge through a ton of people with umbrellas. If you go to the Starbucks on the corner, you can get some great pictures. Be careful if you use the subway at the crossing on a busy night; I saw a lot of intoxicated young people trying to make their way done the stairs. Go to visitacity.com to help you plan your itinerary. Tip: have your video option on your phone ready for the memories."

In essence, each street gets the right of way via stop lights and then when they've all had a shot, traffic stops so all of the pedestrians get to cross whichever street they prefer in the intersection. Like most things we've found in Tokyo, there seems to be order amongst the hustle of the city. We were told to view the scramble from the second floor of the Starbucks, which was probably a good suggestion, but it is hardly a secret and space is limited."

It was warm and muggy, with light sprinkles, but that didn't deter us from making the best of the situation.

Honestly, I saw several busy crossings on my way from Harajuku to Shibuya, but you definitely know when you are here. My one recommendation, if you're walking towards Shibuya Station, crossing the street--wave. Someone in the crowd will take a picture of you doing it. If you are heading in the same direction towards Shibuya Station, Hachiko is south, maybe 30-feet, pass the groups of people gathered to photograph the crossing, and you'll find a small 'waiting' area with a line of visitors taking photos with the statue.Be mindful, there are several entrances to the station to different train lines, so choose wisely. A lot of people were getting lost and confused, and trying to get out, and the train gates will close--so you'll have to see an attendant to have your card cleared. You definitely don't want to get trapped here during a rush-hour. If it's this busy on a Sunday, I can't imagine how bad it would be during working hours.For me, alone, it was not overwhelming. Yet, the rush of the crowd and be stressful, especially if you get lost or lose a friend. So make sure you really need to, and really want to come here. It is a huge contrast to the slower pace you find in other places, especially the parks and shrines."

More than a few people \"crossing\" were tourists getting selfies. If you are in the area drop in and check the box but don't plan anything special to do this."

First is the pedestrian scramble, where seven pedestrian crossings interchange on one street. Imagine hundreds of people crossing the street from all directions at the same time - a very interesting sight to see. Second, is the hachiko monument. A statue dedicated to Hachiko, a loyal dog who waited for his Master because he did not know that his Master has already died. His Master worked at the train station and that is why his monument is just the opposite outside of the train station. He died a few years after while waiting for his Master to come home. He refused to serve anyone. This place now serves as a waiting area for friends who have set appointments or to meet.Third, is of course, a giant shopping arena where all the brands are located. You will never be bored at Shibuya."

It is a junction where many major roads meet at a traffic intersection that is surrounded by buildings with neon billboards and signs, just off Shibuya train station. This area is known for its shopping with many department stores and large well known clothing and electronic franchises. It is very popular with Japanese youth and a good place to people watch. Because of the young demographic it attracts, you will often see large trucks with bearing billboards for buy and girl bands with music blaring driving by. there are several ways and perspectives in which to experience the crossing. The first is to actually cross and experience what it is like being part of the throng of people trying to get from one side of the intersection to the other- and be astounded by just how orderly it is! Another way is to grab a coffee at Starbucks which overlooks the crossing and sit there and watch from above. A third way is to go to the above ground crossway that takes you from the main entrance of Shibuya station to the main department stores across the road and take pictures from above.When at the crossing, take the time to check out nearby Shibuya 109 fashion house for young women which showcases various Japanese fashion subcultures and can be quite an experience. It is also right next to the famous statue of Hachiko- the loyal dog who waited for his master each day at the station even after his Master's death."

Find a window-side seat at the very prominent Starbucks up on the 2nd level. While you sip your latte, you'll have a ringside seat overlooking all of the action.Every 4 mins, when the walk light turns green, READY, SET, GO, \u2026 up to ONE THOUSAND people simultaneously, smoothly, politely, effortlessly surge out onto 7 interlocking crosswalks, miraculously never coming close to running into anyone else (Tokyo-ites have built-in GPS + radar which keeps them from ever colliding with anyone else) \u2026 the human melange is a 1-minute intricate ballet of 1,000 dancers and POOF! \u2026 the crosswalks clear and the cars start streaking through the intersection of 5 different streets once again \u2026 4 mins later, hit the replay button and another 1,000 folks have materialized to re-enact the ballet once more.All of this is surrounded by a New York Times Square-esque galaxy of neon, the dozens of mega-jumbo-trons all talking to you in very polite but loud, insistent Japanese to BUY SOMETHING! A cityscape like \u201cBlade Runner\u201d, without the buzz-kill dystopian part. Please see my video clips at the very end of the photos section for this attraction. ENJOY!Absolute breeze to get to ... just pop out of the Hachiko exit at Shibuya Station on the JR Yamanote line. You'll get to \"scramble\" yourself as you cross diagonally away from the JR Station to get to the Starbucks ... just keep walking in a straight-line without making eye contact and you'll miraculously not run into anyone ;-)"

All of the stools surrounding the area is cramped and overfilled with tourists waiting their turn to get a photo......right beside a \"no photos allowed\" sign. Secondly, whilst a panoramic photo opportunity IS provided, I found the view to be of the boring side of the intersection that had very little to offer aesthetically as far as good photography goes. Take the opportunity to go at night time and cross the intersection several times yourself. If you do feel the need to stop in the middle of the intersection to get that perfect shot, be realistic and prepared to be shoved and pushed by locals trying to get where they are going.

I don't know why, maybe because it's a tourist staple and it's been in a lot of movies but it was exciting to come and see it in person.I did as many travellers have suggested and went up to the second floor of Starbucks. It was very busy and I had to stand around and wait for a window seat but eventually I snagged one. I didn't buy anything from the Starbucks by the way because it looked pretty unsanitary downstairs, just thought I'd throw that in there. Anyway it was a great spot to sit and view the scramble and also take pictures and videos. It was pretty humorous to see the signs up in the store saying don't take photos or videos when that was what everyone was there to do. After watching the scramble from above go down there and join it, it truly is an experience. I don't know how they all avoid each other but I couldn't manage it, I was constantly bumping into people. The surrounding area was also good for shopping so I can say I would put this on my 'must go' list."

But it's also just life in a densely populated city. If you want to see the real Tokyo - that is the gritty, fascinating shadow that falls when Tokyoites take their ties off and let their hair down - go here at 3 in the morning after a night partying at one of Shibuya's numerous bars, nightclubs or karaoke joints. Venture outside in the crisp night air, encountering many fellow revellers in your wake, and take a seat outside the station right beside the crossing. Not only will you make friends with chatty, inebriated Japanese revellers but you'll also bear witness to the piles of trash that accumulate during all that ridiculous people traffic. You also might encounter the various animals that call Shibuya crossing their night time home. It's an experience that rivals Shibuya crossing at it's busiest and, in my opinion, excels it."

It is a metaphor for Japan, chaos and craziness but all in an organised way.Trying to get to the crossing can be quite difficult as Shibuya Metro station is extremely large.There are a huge number of exits in the station and the maps aren't always straight forward to point out where the crossing is.The exit can you need to look for is the Hachiko exit (Hachi = eight) so exit eight which will bring you right to the crossing. This will also be shown by the famous bronze dog statue right outside the exit.One of the best times to head to the crossing would be around 5pm due to how busy it is and toward the evening the lights on and around the buildings start to come on.Its also best to try and find the suitable place higher up in a building to get a good shot of the crossing. I would recommend the Starbucks, get the Matcha green tea Frappuccino and sit on the second floor near the window.The surrounding area has your usual restaurants, cafes and normal fashion stores, so nothing too exciting but it is a great place to relax in for an hour or two. Also a little note, near the exit there is also a green bus sort of monument out there, where they sometimes have people performing, or when I went there were girls handing out free hugs ;)Always a bonus!A must visit when in Tokyo!!!"

Some are going to work, some are headed home, some are just going about their day, but everyone moves across in a sort of controlled chaos.

To get the best view, go to one of the coffee shops or restaurants that are on the second or third floor of the buildings on the corner (Starbucks is a good option) and watch the unchoreographed but graceful ballet taking place below; then go to one of the corners and make a crazy crossing of your own.

Exactly in correspondence with the Shibuya train station and the famous statue from the movie Hakiko, this special attraction I personally consider it among the top attractions of the city, this recall seeing it on TV and in various documentaries hundreds of times and the curiosity that prompted me to visit it was high. It was just like on TV !! Hundreds of people all still waiting for the signal from 4 opposite sides of the road, when the crossing signal is triggered you see literally a flood of people crossing the road and avoid themselves almost by a miracle, it was a weird experience the feeling to cross the road, again and again! I've done it many times and it was really fun. At night with all those lights ... This is one of the most iconic places in Tokyo and throughout Japan as well."

I had plans to meet with some friends and since I didn't know Tokyo well at all I had no idea where I was at that time. I walked through this intersection a few times before even realizing that it was the \"famous intersection in Japan\". I would recommend this area for anyone who really wants to do some shopping / clubbing / or go to expensive restaurants. But...frankly speaking I felt that I was in more awe and amazement of the intersection after seeing it in the movie \"Lost in Translation\"."

Well, after reviewing Asakusa, Shinjuku and Roppongi, here's the megalopolis's crossroads and where you feel the density of the capital. The amount of people in the streets (all organized, mind you) during rush hour, is an attraction in itself. It can me a a dazing experience to try walking on those sidewalks during any time of day (or night) but - a nice alternative - is to go to a second floor ice cream parlor and view the maze from above.I'm beginning to understand that Tokyo (unlike so many other cities) need lengthy reviews and of each individual quarter. Shibuya is one of the most fun.EnjoyLOVEGerald Thomas"

Iconic buildings and structures have always been a great attraction to travelers around the world due to their uniqueness and most often they are associated with extravagant cost to build. Some may involved untold sacrifices and miseries over a long period of time and even deatht. It is from this perspective that the Shibuya Pedestrian Scramble, in Tokyo Japan is unique and probably so in the world as this iconic attraction is built by just using a couple of liters of white paint and a few meters of tarmac. Yet it has attracted millions of visitors around the world to Shibuya to witness and at the same to experience and be part of Shibuya scramble history.This iconic venue was not built to attract tourists, neither was their intention, as it was the desire to provide a smooth sailing pedestrian walk from all points and directions. What makes it more interesting is that all the scramble zebra crossings traffic light will turn green all at the same time giving a remarkable impression of movements of human beings which is sheer amazing to look at, giving a circular movements of people in opposite and in all directions. It is a great feeling standing near the Hatchinko Monument [a well known story about a loyal dog and its master professor who died, turned into a Hollywood movie acted by Richard Gere] and just spending time looking at those people crossing.The best time to watch will be during the rush hour in the morning where people are scrambling to cross to go to work and vice-versa in the evening when they return home. At night, it is more stunning as it is illuminated by neon lights all round just like Piccadally Circus in London or the Time Square in New York. The irony is that you may be taking pictures of people crossing but at the same time you yourself may be in the picture taken by someone else. For bird's eye view get to overhead bridge connected to Tokyu departmental store which will give a vintage point to observe. The Shibuya Pedestrian Scramble is surrounded by shopping, restaurants, cafes and everything else you could think of and easily accessible by public transportation.If you are in Tokyo and you have not experience the Shibuya pedestrian scramble, then your visit to Japan is not considered complete. So why not try it out yourself when you are are in Tokyo the next time around - after all it is free and you can repeat the crossings as many time as you wish and be part of that scramble history.

A genuine focal point to every visit to Tokyo. The pulsing energy of this area feels like being at the epicentre of the world. From the multitude of crossings, the glare of the digital TV commercials played out day and night and provide the soundtrack to this magical part of the world. Sky high billboards and music, which add to the living movie set which has featured in too many films to mention. This coupled with the nearby tourist office, Hachiko statue, department and boutique stores and restaurants contribute to make this a wonderful eye show.Any visit to Tokyo is incomplete without swinging by the heart and soul of Shibuya."

The amount of people crossing when the light goes green is just amazing! This is definitely a must see!"

We had to see it, of course. It was amazing how orderly the Japanese were in the midst of the chaos. At the crossing, I really felt the pulse of Tokyo. I did not really enjoy the experience, I felt kind of stressed with all the people around me but hey, we were there for the experience! By the way, it was so crowded, we could not find a suitable dining place - in the end, we took a train to another vicinity for dinner, lol!"

The Shibuya pedestrian crossing, so famous, is really worth your time if you can spare some, but do not see it as a must to grab the taste of Tokyo and Japan. The crossing is chaotic, yes, but do not expect thousands of persons fighting to get across. It is crowded but not at all times. The most typical place to spend time looking at it is from the second floor of the Starbucks, though normally seating is not easily available there. There are other attractions in the surroundings, mainly restaurants and shops. My recommendation is to start walking from Harajuku down to Shibuya to enjoy all the area of these two well known modern neighbourhoods of Tokyo. And do not forget to pay your visit to the statue of the dog Hachiko close to the metro exits."

The evening rush-hour crowds are a little more thrilling to see, but the best, and most crowded, time to view Shibuya is Saturday evening, when not only is half the city is crossing the street, the other half is waiting at Shibuya station to meet people. It's fantastic. Also, a little-known viewing spot, other than the infamous second-storey Starbucks, is in the 2nd floor pedestrian hallway, crossing from Tokyu Plaza(behind Hachiko) towards Mark City. And you don't have to buy an over-priced latte to watch, either."

With the traffic flowing and the throng of people on the street it looks like any other busy Tokyo thoroughfare, but as the green man shows, so the magic begins. Up to 3000 people cross in multiple directions at any time, repeated every couple of minutes. And as is the Japanese way, it's so ordered. I'd recommend going just after sun set to catch the splendour of the neon jungle surrounding the crossing, the Starbucks coffee shop has a great view and is worth wandering through to experience, however, it is very busy and space is limited. I found a nice street level corner to deposit myself (out of the way of the locals and tourists) to sit and watch the ebb and flow of this tide of people."
