The surrounding of the park is full of cheap eats of chestnut sellers, corn on the cob and fresh bread with a small shop in the centre, small Mosque and WC facilities that do cost 1 lira. There is a Islamic Science and Technology Museum and Restaurant on the side opposite the Topkapi Palace and the tall trees, gardens, sculptures and many cats make this park the most calming place in Istanbul.I went there everyday to sit and relax, perfect to calm things down or reflect."

The park offers a wonderful respite from the tourist hordes at the major attractions. The tall deciduous (Poplar) trees provided much welcome shade from the heat. There is an abundant number of benches throughout; many seem to be taken up by young couples! Definitely a place for families, and also those seeking some \u2018solo\u2019 quiet time with a book. I consider this place better than Topkapi Palace."

The park is covered by very tall trees which provide a reprieve from the hot summer days and there is also a lovely playground for children.

I was last there in April 2014 and the park looked much more beautiful then as the famous tulip flower beds were resplendent. This time there were very few flowers in bloom and the park looked a little unkempt.

In other times of the year Gulhane park is full of flowers, perhaps not as attractive as Turkish tulips, but still this is nice place to walk.

There are lots of shady spots (though not enough benches to sit on) and simit and ice-cream sellers at the entrance. There are some notable relics to discover, but the best thing is you can cut through right to the Marmara seashore and its shoreline path. As a runner, I found it safe to be in the early morning and a great way to connect with the city."

My impression of Istanbul is that if something can be made more beautiful, they will do it. Every surface in the city is adorned in some way. A fantastic place to visit, I cannot wait to return and spend more time in the park."

There are no facilities to speak of in the park, but the street just outside has shops and restuarants. This would be more of a convenient place to sit and rest up than a \"must-see\" attraction."

Walking downhill towards Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, along the tramway, a large gate in a high wall, on the right, leads through to the Archaeological Museum and to G\u00fclhane Park, which was established in 1912. This was formerly the outer gardens of the palace, where several varieties of roses were grown. Rose oil and rose water were in great demand for use in the palace, the harem and the palace hospital, for its scent and disinfectant qualities. The Isparta Scented Rose Garden was opened in 2013. The generous donation of approximately 40,000 roses trees by the Isparta-G\u00fcneykent Municipality, were planted in a reconstruction of the historic G\u00fclhane Rose Garden, in its original location, within the park.Today it is a place in which to enjoy a gentle stroll and is very popular with the \u201c\u0130stanbullu\u2019s\u201d, particularly on Sundays and public holidays. The throngs of people stroll around nibbling on nuts and sun-flower seeds, the shells littering the paths. A subterranean cistern from the Roman era served as an aquarium and a rather tatty set of cages were passed off as a zoo, filled with some very pitiful animals and birds. In July 2009 renovations of the park were completed and the zoo closed. On one of my visits to the city, \u015eeker Bayramii was being celebrated in the park. There were numerous attractions such as \"Roll-a-Penny\", where a 50Kr coin is rolled down a chute with the object of placing the coin within a square. If the coin does not touch the sides of the square you win your stake. Hoopla, throw a ring over a wooden square, which also has the prize sitting on top of it, and its yours, and Pick a Duck, choose one of the plastic ducks, which are floating in a container full of water, and the number on the bottom denotes the prize, usually a penny whistle or a balloon. There was also Candy Floss, Toffee Apples and stalls selling Windmills and Balloons. It brought back so many memories of my childhood, when the fair came to the town every year.Simple pleasures, especially for those who do not have fat wallets. G\u00fclhane Parki open every day. Museum open every day except Monday, 09:00-17:00. "

This used to be the main courtyard of the Topkapi Palace, where the imperial edicts were read by the viziers. It also had formal rose gardens which were strictly for the use of the Sultan, his family and harem. It was made free for public in early 1900s. Various museums are located in this park. I found it a very restful place as the kids could run around freely while the adults relaxed. It is an ideal place to mingle with the locals."

In the mid-1980s, I couldn't get out of the place fast enough. I found its condition to be deplorable and the small zoo on the grounds to have severe maintenance issues. it was also the only zoo I've visited worldwide that included domestic cats in some of the cages. These were white cats with one amber and one blue eye. But on this visit, I wanted to linger in the park.The zoo is long gone, and the renovations undertaken in 2003 have made the 40-acre park into an urban oasis with much more open space. We strolled by myriad tall plane trees that looked elegant, even with leafless limbs. Fountains splashed in small ponds, crossed by footbridges, and flowerbeds brought color to the winter landscape. Stone Lions and statues added interesting details. A playground brought families with children into the area. Had it been a bit warmer, we could have easily sat for a spell on one of the numerous benches.This park nudges the western wall of Topkapi Palace and was once part of the palace's outer garden. It offers a lovely view of the Golden Horn from its Northeastern edge and the Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar Literature Museum Library on the Southern end.I think Gulhane Park would be an especially nice place for a picnic in milder weather and we look forward to returning in spring or summer."

Entry is priced at 0 lira as this park is free to enter. When I say free I don't actually mean free - because this park has cars racing up and down it like nobody's business which could cost you your life - isn't that a big price to pay. If you manage to dodge the cars then you can appreciate the views of the park which is well maintained with beautiful trees and ponds. I researched the park afterwards to establish why there were so many cars racing about and found out that Istanbul had lost the opportunity to host the F1 GP which of course explains it all."

It is very well kept like most of Istanbul and gives great views of the walls surrounding topkapi palace. I was alarmed by the figures of lions standing on balls, all but one were right footed. This discriminates against left footers, Lionel Messi, the greatest player ever, is a leftie for goodness sake. We need to encourage more kids to be left footed or we will end up with people like Phil Neville playing left back all around the world."

This is a lovely Plain tree-lined mature city park that makes for a nice recreational breather after all of the indoor museums. There are benches, low key community art sculptures, and when we were there, free flying parrots! The parrots make their homes in the trees and fly/squawk to one another. We probably spent 1/2-1 hour walking around, resting, and just enjoying the flora and fauna (plenty of Istanbulite cats as well)."

Suddenly you will need a break from it all, so go to the Gulhane park. Nestled on the eastern side of \"European\" Istanbul, this large park is a maze of pathways between beautiful beds of grass and flowers; there are also a couple of fountain too. No one will hustle you here, just sit and enjoy it or stroll about. Enjoy!"

This park is located right underneath the topkapi palace, which is probably the reason not many tourists go there. Too bad, since it is very, well, Turkish. There is a lovely, authentic tea garden (cai bahce) right at the edge, overlooking the Bosporus where you can have a glass of tea and a snack. Even though you are right near one of Turkey's most famous sights, you will not find many tourists here. Definitely off the beaten track.There are several things to take a look at. There are also good public restroom facilities (for a small amount)."

It is not a peaceful park as the rush of traffic can be constantly heard, or a large park as it is limited by the walls of the palace, but it is a great place to catch your breath in a busy city."

It's popular with locals and tourists alike and easily possible to while away a couple of hours just chilling out and taking a break from the madness of this amazing city, re-charging ready for another round of attractions."

It is nice year around, well maintained but of course in April during Tulip Festival it looks its best! This year they also had world biggest tulip carpet displayed close to the park. Tulips of all kinds and colors were all over the place, so pretty! Finally, I got to see so many tulips:) No need to bother getting Shengen visa and going to Holland, when you can just come to Istanbul! Emirgan park should be great too but having heard it is inconvenient to get there, we skipped it this time.Park has great views of Bosphosus, but unfortunately, all the places with such views are occupied with overpriced tea houses. To a have a nice view, you need to pay 15 lira per two person kettle of tea. Ours was leaking and water was not even filtered, as I made weaker tea, I could feel chlorine taste. In any grocery shop you can buy a kilo bag of great local tea for less money! Take it home, watch on internet how to brew it and enjoy for months. So better to enjoy the views while you are touring Top Kapi Palace, there is a great terrace and skip them in the park. On weekends it may get crowded and when they replace flower beds and use some noisy equipment it is also better to avoid. But in April it is a must see!"

It is not the largest park in the known universe but it is a great place for a wander and to give your brain a rest from all the history and architecture! It is also a riot of colour. Flowers, flowers and more flowers and the effect is quite pleasing.One of the great parts is the external view of Topkapi Palace as well as the views from the cafes that line the edge of it with wonderful vistas over the Bosphorus. In fact this chance to get off your feet and soak up the view as well as scoring some quick food is a great way of breaking up a day of sightseeing in the old part of the city.And when you are ready to start your sightseeing again you are right near the Museum of Science & Technology in Islam or you can just wander back up into the fray of the Hippodrome area."

We passed by again the next day much calmer and easier to see displays and take photos.If visiting at another time of year suspect would be bedding plants but some rose bushes in evidence too."

A short walking distance from G\u00fclhane & Sultanahmet Tram Station.Come out from the park and walk towards the Sultanahmet Tram Station there is a small little restaurant named 3B Kitchen which i find their food is very nice with reasonable price."

If you walk to the Bophorus end, take the time to get some tea in the outside caf\u00e9, where you have great view. Unfortunately it is crowded during high season, but if you are lucky you will get a table directly on edge. Tea is served in a teapot, so you can spend some time sitting there and enjoying the view. Since it is close to Sultanahmet/Hagia Sophia, Topkapi and various museums, it is perfect for taking a break in the middle of the day. Enjoy!"

Gulhane Park means \"Rosehouse Park\" in Turkish and it is just a step away from TopKapi.I had the chance and I visited the park both in November and July. Gulhane Park in autumn is amazing. Yes, you can feel the cold while wondering around but its scenery is ....breathless! It is less crowded, falling leaves are everywhere.... Don't forget to treat yourself warm chestnuts. Buy them from the main entrance (Sultanahment).Thus in July, the park is obviously more green, more people are going up and down, yet it keeps the same beauty! Don't forget to pay a visit to the coffee shop which is located towards the end of the park! Treat yourself a cup of tea and enjoy the view of Bosporus!It's a very good choice to \"fill up your batteries\" and carry on exploring the city!"

The roses, when in bloom, smell like magic. The park dogs are friendly and playful, unlike many of the half-comatose dogs in other parts of Istanbul. Take a snack and sit at the overlook... you won't be disappointed."

There are some beautiful fountains and this is just at the entrance. We didn't get round the whole park as it was nearly dusk but when I return to Istanbul I would love to take a picnic and spend the day watching the cats chase butterflies and just to relax and people watch.

We ambled through, when you looked to upper paths you could see the walls of Topkapi Palace, a bit further and there were some fountains to enjoy too. You could easily bring a picnic here to get some respite from the, sometimes overwhelming crowds and noise of Istanbul. Once through the old wall gates, trams pass by up and down the hill, then a ten minute stroll (uphill) brings you to the square with Hagia Sofia on one side and the Blue Mosque on the other, simply took my breath away.

We strolled in the park. The paths are wide and had flowers and fountains. It was not so crowded. Since we were short of time we did not go till the end. It was a nice short visit and a respite from the crowds."

I have been in Istanbul six times and this is the first time I have been to Gulhane Park. I came in the early AM to beat the heat and any tourists. It was a delight.There were some interesting art pieces in the park resembling large stylized caftans where one could stand behind and have one's photo taken. Very cute.I would not recommend going out of the way to get here, but if you in the neighborhood, a short spot of time here will be very nice."

The cafe at the end of the park offers awesome views of the Bosphorus but the tea is pricey as I suppose the tea includes the view.

Aside from the historical background, Gulhane Park, next to Top Kapi Palace, is he place you will enjoy most when tired of walking. To tell the truth, we have been coming to Istanbul since the early 1990s but never knew of Gulhane Park, only of Gulhane Tramway Stop. However, jut inquisitive of a door in the high wall, opposite the Tramway Stop, I found access to Beltur Gulhane Kandil Tesislari and through it, making to the outdoor seating and also the Gulhane Park. Wow, what a beautiful park with tall lush green trees, grounds covered with flower beds, and lots of attractions for children. Gardeners were rushing to finish new flower beds along the main road. It has Rose Grden too (Gulhane means Rose Gaden or House of Roses) We also discovered the Museum of History of Science and Technology in Islam, opened few years ago. More cultural institutions are expected to be opened in this Park in future. Besides Turkish families, we spotted lots of visitors from the Khaleej (UAE) with children enjoying as much as the locals. I strongly recommend to visitors to Istanbul to explore Gulhane Park, don't forget your camera."

When i went there the temperature would have been between 15 to 18 degrees celsius. there was a soft sun that was out in all its glory - not a cloud in the sky. i spent about an hour just sitting on a bench and soaking in the great weather and looking at people. there were quite a few locals (in fact more locals than tourists). i went on a saturday and maybe because of this the local crowd was more. on a weekday it may be a bit more desolate and private.the garden is well laid out. nice flowers blooming including tulips, the grass is green, some pergolas and shaded sitting areas are present and there are a lot of benches for you to sit on - nice and clean. there is a fountain at the entrance and a small stream that runs through the park. there are wild parrots and cranes (depending on the time of year i guess) and seagulls. The cacophony of their bird call can be a bit too much sometime especially the parrots. if you want to rest after a lot of walking around then this is a nice place. if you like green areas then this will be to your liking. ther is also an islamic science museum highlighting the scientific achievements of old islamic cultures. a couple of restaurants (at least one) is also present. the weather of course is most important like in any other park. not a place that you need to separately mark out in your itinerary but then if you have the time and the ooportunity then take a peek."

Adding the water features and fountains it was a lovely place to relax and spend time. I returned in July and was disappointed to find that there were few floral displays and the fountains were not switched on. It is still a quiet oasis within a bustling city but it is a pity that the feast of floral displays is not continued through the summer months."

While we were in Istanbul we were fortunate to stay near this park and never missed an opportunity to walk through it. Enchanting, and I think it should be a higher priority on visitors' \"must do\" lists while in Istanbul. The diversity is amazing -- locals and tourists, young and old, and some women covered from head to toe and others in miniskirts. We even saw a wedding couple getting their photos taken while we were there."

First, it's closer to the tourist sites in Sultanahmet. You can walk to Gulhane after lunch and a morning of sightseeing. It will provide you with a nice afternoon break before resuming the rest of your sightseeing for the day. Second, Gulhane is bigger and the paths are clear. We got lost a bit in Yeldiz, which wasn't fun because the park was hilly. We did notice, coincidentally, that there were more cuddly PDA-type couples in Yeldiz; so if that's your priority, then Yeldiz will appeal to you more. Yeldiz has more woody and shaded areas, but Gulhane has the flowers. We were there the first week of May. Most of the tulips were gone, but for some reason the yellow ones have survived till then. Lastly, Gulhane has more benches than Yeldiz. The few that were available in Yeldiz were already occupied when we were there. If you enjoy walks in parks, try to make it to Gulhane. I'm not sure if it's going to be worth it when the weather gets hot though. By then Yeldiz will be a cooler place to spend your time since it's more shaded than Gulhane."

It is easy to miss as not much is made of it in tourist literature and it is reached either by a lane (which has attractive wooden houses and the splendid Sarnic cistern restaurant) in between Hagia Sophia and the Topkapi Palace or at the north end of Alemdar Cad. There is also a 'Gulhane' tram stop a short way north of the entrance.This is a wonderful park: with views of the Golden Horn and Bosphorus on one side and the wall of the Topkapi Palace (interesting to view this sight from below) on the other. It is beautifully planted and very well provided with benches and various quirky and attractive features. Be warned, though, that the toilets cost a Lira and are of the dreaded 'Turkish' type. At the far end of the Park is a cafe Set Ustu Cay Brahces with superb views over the water. Unfortunately the range of drinks is very limited - I couldn't get an orange or a lemonade and certainly didn't want a Fanta, so we had a pot of tea for two at 14 Lira. But it's a great place to just sit and look out over the Bosphorus as a mid-point in a circuit of the park."

Relatively few of the flowers were trampled as everyone used the same short cuts. It was not only the children posing with the garden ornaments, adults were cheerfully posing with large fibre glass squirrels. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em - I shamelessly posed with a giant plastic squirrel.

I agree with most of the reviews i.e. to visit it after a tiring walk, after the Bazar or after a day of turist stay. But - and this is my suggestion - I prefer to visit it early in the morning (9 a.m or before) when I stay in Istanbul for my business and before meetings or other engagements.early in the morning in a sunny day, it's just like to cross a door out of the word and far from any fighting. The birds cancell any town noice (traffic, crowd, confusion... nothing will still exist inside). the colors and the flowers are beautiful. Very few people inside, some yung mother with her children, some studends crossing out of the traffic, some old people on the park benches, some dogs playing and following - happy - the people crossing the parkit sounds like a jump in another dimention, especially if compared with the usual and nice confusion of a town like Istanbul.I abitually stay there for a while (half an hour) before taking a taxi to my meetingsIf I have time enough, I stay for more and I have the opportunity to write many pages for my future books. If not, only five minutes are sufficient for a sort of \"oriental cleaning\" of my mind.Last time (5 days ago), I had the fantastic opportunity to see many cicognas (storks) with their babies in their nests up above the white trees. No words able to descive that!To visit it? Easy. From Santa Sofia, down in direction to the sea. 500 meters walking, you'll find three stone arches on the right. Crossing them you can see and enter the park. A long avenue with a duble line of white high plane trees. Green everywhere and flowers. Inside the only \"noise\" is the voice of many different birds. You can cross it and go out on the left, closed to the railway station in front of Bosphorus the only negative remark is due to the many public cars using this lane for crossing the area. take care... and enjoy this incredible corner of paradise"

In the height of summer this park, formerly part of the Topkapi Palace gardens, has lots of cool shade from the glorious collection of tall trees. So we strolled through, sat on one of the many new clean benches, avoided the odd car dashing too fast throlongtime park along its widest path and exited at the far gate at the tip of the peninsula. The walk back to the ferry area was less salubrious due to the heavy traffic along the dual carriageway alongside the railway cutting. But the park is pleasant and safe."

No signs or Ads to guide you that there is a park inside. We even had a doubt that this is just a park !!!"

It is a park that houses The Museum of Islamic Inventions and Technology,just a few steps on your left when you enter the park.It also leads the way to the famous Topkapi palace.And it the park walk finishes with a glorious view on the Marmara.That is not to mention the enchanting multi-colored rose shrubs all over the place,hence the name Gulhane (roses in Turkish).Tha park has many wooden seats if you ever feel tired of strolling around the place.There are also corn,chesnut and simit vendors outside the park is you are hungry.So basically you are covered for your needs!The park is amazing place to unwimd after a long tiring day of walking and site-seeing.It is also a bonus for you if you choose to stay in one of the hotels in the old city section,Sultanmehemet,which covers most of the touristic Turkish sites.Do yourself a favor,stop by and smell the roses,literally.Magical!"

I started my walk in Sirkeci and finished it at the cafe at the end, overlooking the Bosphorus. Try a tea (\u00e7ay) overthere, its expensive but you will discover you are getting a nice teapot, and the sight is beautiful. When i am there again end of this month i will certainly go again. At this moment there is the tulipfestival in Istanbul and i am sure there wil be many tulips in the Park."

A fish pond and fountain, statues and lots of green grass area and wooden benches for sitting.If you walk until the end of the park going to the seaside, you can turn right just before the exit and go up to a cluster of coffee/tea shops and enjoy a great view of the bosphorous while drinking a hot cup of tea from the the tea garden cafe.So if you're tired and want a piece of a little peace after several museum visits, come to the park, rest for awhile, sit at the grass, recharge."

The tree-lined walking paths are stately and wide, and the flower beds and blooming shrubbery are lovely. It's quite a long park, with walls running the length and large ancient gates on either end. You can also get into the park by a small road coming out by the Archeology Museum (which sits on the edge of the grounds of the Topkapi Palace). This park is perhaps Istanbul's answer to Manhattan's Central Park (although smaller, of course). There were few tourists there, mostly locals who were really enjoying the park with their families and friends. The trees provide gentle shade, and it is quite lovely for a stroll. There are a few food carts, but not many. There are public bathrooms, and a very lovely old fountain for hand-washing at one end. At the end of the park (furthest from Topkapi Palace) there are some cafes right on the hill overlooking the Bosphorus, and you can sit right at the edge and look down over an amazing view. In my opinion, this was the best view I saw on my Istanbul trip. I really recommend a stroll through Gulhane Park, perhaps before or after you see the Topkapi Palace or the Archeological Museum. There's a small park in the grounds of Topkapi Palace, but Gulhane is much nicer and much larger, so you can get quite a lovely stroll. And, on the plus side, there are not really large tour groups, so its much easier to stroll at your own pace in the lovely walkways, without the crazy crowds."
