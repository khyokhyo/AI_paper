Collectively, the sum is far, far greater than the mere addition of the parts, and I am describing an aesthetic not a religious experience."

Start at Piazza Farnese where you can have a coffee at the only bar on the Piazza, then follow the signs for Piazza Navona (just across the main street called Corso Vittorio Emanuele) but don't stop at any of the restaurants here as in my view they are not good value for money. Once you have admired the Bernini fountain follow the signs for the Pantheon which is a sight to behold. Again the bars/restaurants around here will charge higher prices because of the location, so I would not recommend them, but try the ice-cream place which is few yards away from the Pantheon and which boasts 150 ice-cream flavours, can't remember the name of the place or the address (sorry) but if you have the Pantheon on your right (passed the two bars facing it) take a left and walk around 100 yards and you'll find it."

Do your best to avoid the tourist trap pizzerias, restaurants, and cafes.

With so much to check out, just walking around makes it a great afternoon."

The World Heritage folks say that the area encompasses everything inside the (17th century) walls, as well as St. Paul's basilica (outside the walls). That's pretty much all of old Rome.The centro storico (historic center) must have:(1) monuments of antiquity (2) fortifications built over the centuries (3) Baroque and Renaissance urban developments (4) civil and religious buildingsThat's pretty much all of \"Rome\" (and it is all of Rome, in the eyes of the World Heritage Organization). Some Centro Storico highlights are:the Colosseum, the Pantheon the city walls and Castel Sant\u2019Angelothe Piazza Navona the Piazza del Popolothe Piazza di Spagna)the Spanish Stepsthe Capitoline Hill the ForumTrajan\u2019s Column the Column of Marcus AureliusThat's just a start; the basilicas and churches will fill pages. Rome oozes with \"Historic Character\" and the World Historic Organization has recognized that. After spending several days in Rome, I have come to the conclusion that a good, long week (or more) would really be needed to scratch the surface of the Centro Storico (Historic Center) which is actually all of \"Rome\"."

Maybe the Forum is the southern boundry, maybe not. What's important is that it includes so many amazing places to explore. If you have time, throw away your map and just wander.

I will concentrate the review on the pedestrian area starting from Piazza Venezia, looking at the Altare Della Patria and going all the way to the Colosseum, passing through the Trajan column and other Roman ruins. It's a delightful walk, especially if you add the multimedia presentation at Palazzo Valentino, where you will get and explanation of the meaning of the carvings on the Trajan column, and enjoy the view on top of the Altare della Patria. Budget 2 or 3 hours for this walk, more if you watch the multimedia presentation."

You can try one of the free walking tours which we have done in other countries. Then you can go back later when you have a little lay of the land and visit the ones you're most interested in. One other tip is to also see them at night. They look beautiful all lit up. Last tip is to make sure you stay in the city. All of the chain hotels are on the outskirts. Use Air BNB or VRBO and get a house or apartment. That way you can come and go as you please each day. Do not drive. I'm from Boston and I thought our drivers were crazy. They are insane.

Come to Rome to wonder at how much like us the 'ancient' Romans were, to discover the history of European art and architecture (both everyday and religious) and how to enjoy living in a very crowded city! You can still eat well reasonably, sightseeing doesn't have to cost a fortune and you can rest in the cool of largely empty churches when it just gets too much. I am not sure that the Centro Storico is the best place for young children but bright youngsters of 11+ who aren't only interested in technology and TV should enjoy themselves, especially if they have intelligent parents who recognise when a little leavening is needed!"

Maybe there wouldn't be a crisis if they weren't so busy. Never mind.Listen: it's a great city. Really. Seriously. Honest. You'll enjoy it. All of it. It's nothing like New York, and only a little bit like Paris. It's older than both of those combined. Overall, it's probably more beautiful than both of them combined, and, hey, I'm a New Yorker. If you really, really want to enjoy it, you've got to slow down. Stay as long as you possibly can. A week is nice, two weeks A LOT better, three weeks better still. I daresay the folks at home can manage without you in the interim. You may be important, but not THAT important. Kick back and relax. Have some chianti and some coffee, enjoy that pasta dish.

For those interested in art, don't miss the Galleria Borghese, the National Museum of Rome, the Vatican Museums and the Galleria Pamphilj. For those more inclined to view and admire Italian fashion, via del Corso and via del Babuino are important starting points. For Catholics and Christians in general, the Vatican has immense attraction.

Our trip could have been titled 'Lost in Rome' because each day their was a period during which we would become lost wandering through the narrow streets and stumbling upon little piazza's and hidden shops - but each time we somehow found a view of the fabulous white building which looked down over Rome and it became the landmark which guided us back to the center from which we could get our bearings and start our discoveries all over again or wearily make our way back to our hotel. We spent six days wandering round and found new things every day - I am sure this area has more than enough sites/shops/restaurants etc. to cater for tastes - I dare anyone to go to this area in Rome and not be impressed!"

When you're walking in the city centre is easy to get to all the places and see all the monuments, but also discover new places, streets, restaurants, shops. Trastevere and Monti are the best if you're looking for some alternative gift:) You can see where famous movies were shooted and you can talk with other tourists, you can stroll around without an aim, go to the museums or, in case, even take a train to visit some nice small cities that are pretty close, likeTivoli and Bracciano, even the sea at Santa Severa!"

There is so much to see and do in the Center of Rome that it would take a lifetime to fully discover. From historical landmarks to beautiful bars and restaurants, there is a pulse and energy to the city that simply can\u2019t be compared to anything else. Of course you\u2019ll have the negative aspect, which is the population of Rom Gypsies and other miscreants running amok selling whatever. However, the absolute beauty and heartbeat of this city can\u2019t be beat. One of my favorite things to do while in Rome, is sit right in the middle of the hustle and bustle at one of the bars in Piazza Venezia, in front of the Vittoriano, and simply people watch. Another one of my favorites is grabbing your ipad, a book, and go to a bar in Piazza della Rotonda, and again get a nice beverage and relax, watch the world go by and simply soak it in. Another spectacular part of being in Rome is the people. Absolutely fantastic. By and large Romans are willing to help you get where you need to go. Lucky for me I speak Italian and grew up on the outskirts of Rome. However, I own a niche travel agency and seldom hear complaints from clients I send to these locations. They truly enjoy all the beauty in the Eternal City. If you haven\u2019t been yet, you have to go and experience this unique, chaotic, and absolutely gorgeous city on the banks of the Tiber river."

Before walking, read up about the area and prepare yourself for one of the great pleasures to be found in Rome, and it is all free. There are some good restaurants and ice cream shops along the way, for both I recommend the small shops. Lunch time will find the better eateries full.

I've been a serious traveler my whole life and enjoyed close to forty countries --about a third many times and lengthily- including two thirds of both America and Canada. Insofar as walking cities are concerned, New York, Paris, London and Rome -in no particular order- are my favorite of the largest ones.With the cheap transportation cards good on trollies, buses and trains, and systems easy to follow, Rome drops you at a score of starting points for some of the richest freebie and cheap options in which to fill a day. If New York is the big Apple, then Rome is surely the Peeling Onion, as history unfurls layer by layer in a multitude of wildly varied contexts.For those without language ease, I've always felt Italians generally are most patient, proud of their surroundings and desirous to help. If the first or second request isn't generous (rarely happens), by the third you may wind up with a trip biographer.And ladies so far as I can tell, the annoying pinch is long a relic of bin history along with cigarette holders, thin mustaches and halo brimmed hats. It seems the major major mistakes one can make in Rome involve not being fiscally discreet or putting oneself a but too far to get ask early enough. Other than that, there are few wrong directions. one isa great city in which to get a little lost when fitting pieces excitingly is not a requirement. it's hard imagining more than a few who wouldn't elect at least one more day exclusively for leisure in any quadrant of Rome."

There are all categories that you need. the only thing I have to say in negaticvo is that the cost of what you buy to eat in the old town is really high. you can get to pay much even a bottle of water, which in my opinion is not very fair. Of course, there are places that, despite the price, are certainly worth the effort to be tested, to eat maybe a really Roman meal, once at least. but if I can give a sonsiglio, it is better to eat a slice of pizza, they do very good in many small pizza shops around the center, and go to dinner at the restaurant out from the center to go even a little off, in very large suburb that rome offers. even arrivandoo Appia, on tuscolana, or a consular aptre, always in the city but not in the center, there are many delicious places to try, many of which I reviewed myself."

Stroll where fancy dictates and you will come across Piazzas famous and hardly-known; churches - magnificent and humble and streets broad and narrow. Having done this for an hour or so, find a seat on the edge of a bar, grab a glass of Frascati, order a pizza and verdure griglia retrieve your map and guide to review what you have seen and what you still would like to catch.

Start at the Largo Argentina, a collection of four ruined ancient Roman temples along the main street (Corso) where buses run. Walk north toward the Pantheon. Stop at S. Maria sopra Minerva church to see Michelangelo's \"Risen Christ.\" Look at the wonderful sculpted elephant holding an obelisk, by Bernini. A few more steps bring you to the Pantheon, the greatest of Roman temples, the magnificent domed cylinder that represents the world of the gods of the Roman Empire. Slightly west is the university, the Sapienza, and if the church of St. Ivo is open, you will see a spectacular interior, by the great architect Borromini. Then northward to Piazza Navona, on the site of a Roman stadium (which can be visited, underground, entrance on a street to the north of the piazza). On this piazza is a splendid church of St. Agnes by Borromini and others, and three magnificent fountains, the central one (representing four rivers) being one of Bernini's great masterworks. Nearby are the churches of San Luigi dei Francesi with a spectacular chapel by Caravaggio and another beautiful one by Domenichino, and S. Maria della Pace with fine architecture by Pietro da Cortona and interior frescoes including beautiful sibyls by Raphael. The German national church of S. Maria dell'Anima, around the corner, has been beautifully restored recently. Then treat yourself to some gelato at Giolitti, a venerable and famous gelateria nearby."

All you need is a pair of great walking shoes and you can discover from sun-up to sundown. Feel free to wander into any obscure church on any alley - you may find a beautiful Carvaggio painting on the wall like we did. Do not waste your time with breakfast (grab a cappuccino), or lunch (just order a prosciutto on focaccia bread at any one of the little osterias on the way). For dinner, try to find a place away from one of the major areas (Pantheon, Piazza Navonna, etc.,), as you will usually pay for the views rather than the food. Once you find a nice place for dinner (look for somewhere with a line), be prepared to sit down for a couple hours. If you are looking for nightlife, I'd wander over to Campo di'Fiori or Trestevere across the river.Extra tip: they say Rome is best discovered slowly, so don't be afraid to just sit on one of the fountains and watch the day fade away. Also, wake up early and get outside because it's fun to watch the Centro Storico come alive with people."

It isn't top of all the tourist guide and certainly doesn't leap out as somewhere to visit so it's not massively over crowded.If you are visiting the colosseum this is a great place to go for a meal afterwards, loads of great little restaurants that feel like they are well established and traditional.

For those who think that it is the area around the Pantheon, Piazza Navona and the Campo d\u00e8 Fiori: yes, there are lots of historic buildings as well as old apartment houses which will attract and require your attention, but not really related to the origin of Rome. At the same time, during tourist season, this area is crammed with tourists (which does not mean that there are fewer people on the Roman sites) which does not make it real fun when you go there then and follow the main stream. But when you leave the main routes, you will be able to dive into the real capital with quiet streets, nice shops, beautiful osterias, and all of this normally priced. But there is a price you have to pay: you have to speak Italian. You will awarded by a great friendliness and helpfulness from the people living and working there."

Only have a day or two--take a hop on/hop off to get a quick overview of many of the best things. Venture into Trastevere for a less hectic, more homey experience--and find little neighborhood trattorias for the best dining experiences rather than the restaurants surrounding the most popular tourist sites.

Even relatively early on a Sunday morning I had to elbow through tour groups - I've come to loathe those bright umbrellas of guides forging ahead at all costs to get their groups the best of all possible views) at the Pantheon, which I consider the most beautiful building in all of Rome - and that's saying a lot for it, as Rome is overpacked with stunners.

It is a living, breathing and absolutely vital city. Wander its back streets and you will see all kinds of busy activities, cabinet makers at work, shopkeepers serving their local customers, chefs cooking away in restaurant kitchens, old ladies lowering baskets from upper stories for their groceries. Vecchia Roma (Old Rome) is a palimpsest. Civilisations have written and re-written over her for two and a half millenia. If you stand in Piazza Argentina, the excavated ground level of the ruins is 4-5 metres below you. What I love about Rome's historic centre is how little things change. The Roman way of life lives on. I love buying a slice of crisp breakfast pizza with a thin coating of tangy tomato in the Forno Farnese at the western end of Campo di Fiori, or \"un bel caffe\" in the Bar Farnese, or a luncheon slice of pizza from the Pizza by the Slice (pizza al taglio) in Piazza Pollarolla.

Bathrooms are hard to come by once you're on the path through the museum/Basilica so carefully think about your liquid/food consumption strategy. Plan to be here for an entire day. Take a cab back and forth - totally worth the crazy driving/price.If you are coming during hot weather - bring a hand fan, water, sunscreen. It was lovely in October but I can't imagine how hot this could be in mid summer. If you are doing the Vatican museum tour, book your tickets ahead of time online and try to get an early entrance time. I'm going to emphasize early over and over again because the number of people that come here every day is hard to imagine until you see it. It rivals Disney during spring break for a much smaller space. Get a map. There are two \"versions\" of the Vatican museum tour, long and short. We did the short version which gets you to the Sistine Chapel quick. We went back through and saw everything we missed on a second pass that skipped the Sistine chapel. There are a ton of tours moving through and it could be worth it to do one. We bought a book ahead of time and did our own research then just went and appreciated what we saw. And it's amazing. The Sistine chapel is hard to describe, it's different than expected, both bigger and smaller. Be prepared to be shushed over and over again. Also, no shorts or exposed shoulders. The only terrible part about the place is the cafeteria - do not get sucked into buying the lunch there, the food is terrible and the service is decidedly un-Christian. St. Peter's Basilica is free - the horrifying long line you see if for security, not tickets. It moves fast when the security officers feel like doing their job well. When they all go on a smoke break at the same time it stops. Teenagers try to cut the line - don't let them. Once you are through the line, you get as much time as you like in the space. Again, it's hard to describe, only it's much larger and grander than anything you could possibly imagine. It made me cry and I am not religious. You will be shushed a lot and still no shorts or bare shoulders. We didn't do a tour but you may enjoy one, it's an experience even without one. There is an additional museum inside you can pay for. Even if you have already seen a lot of churches in your travels, this one is the one you can't miss."

My visit to St Peter's Basilica and surrounds left me feeling real gratitude to be in such a beautiful place. Though the lines looked long, they moved quickly and entering St Peter's happened quite fast. There was much to see while waiting, every step, or turn worthy of a photo. The visitors came from everywhere and yes, lots of selfies were taken by people and groups in the square and the Basilica, but it did not matter. It's a huge space, there's room for all. I don't think you need a tour or guide, in fact they seem a distraction unless you want every fact. Experience the beauty, the art, the grandeur, the detail. Wander slowly. Highly recommend, don't be turned off by the queues, it's worth it."

If you can, try to plan your visit to Rome so that you stay in a hotel or lodging in the Centro Storico, so you can tumble out of your room in the morning and explore all day. If you\u2019re staying elsewhere, definitely spend some time here! Within easy walking distance, you\u2019ll find the Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, palazzos, fountains, piazzas, museums, churches, and monuments galore. Many of the smaller streets are pedestrianized, or almost pedestrianized (watch out for the occasional car or motorcycle!) while the major streets are likely to carry large amounts of traffic. The area is not well served by the Metro, but trams and bus routes provide access. The Largo Argentina is a hub for many bus routes. There are dozens of restaurants and gelato shops, and nothing is better than just enjoying the cafes and streets. Duck into a church during open hours and admire the mosaics and sculptures and paintings and marble floors. Cross the Tiber on one of the bridges and look back at the city domes and spires and rooftops. Walk through the Jewish Ghetto and find the ancient buildings adapted for more modern uses. You could spend an afternoon there or a week. But definitely go!"

The people and particularly the taxi drivers are very nice and friendly. Get a good map and don't waste time standing at bus stops. Most of the ancient sites are within a very walkable distance of one another. Taxis are suprisingly cheap here. I can't stress how much there is to do and see. Don't try to squeeze it all in. Pick your top ones, fit those in, and anything else will be a bonus."

If you don't want to wait in line or pay entry fees to the Colosseum and Roman Forum, get a good guidebook (Rick Steves and the Essential Insiders Guide are recommended), walk around the Colosseum, and around the Arc of Constantine, and then up the Capitoline Hill. Behind the Senate are excellent views of the Forum. Read the information about these places in your guidebooks. We found that we most enjoyed the places that aren't the top tourist spots - the Monti neighborhood south of the Terminal, the Jewish ghetto, and wandering anywhere away from the main conduits from the main sites."

Welcome to the Historic City of Rome, heart of the Old Roman Empire, home of the Catholic Church and the city where Caravaggio, Michelangelo and Bernini left their mark. This is one of those very special places where you find layer upon layer of history spanning the past two millennia. Rome is an amazing city to visit, sprawling with ancient ruins and structures, filled with decorative churches, littered with sumptuous fountains, elegant sculptures and worldly artworks. Rome has it all and lots of it - history, beauty, architecture, art, religion, gelato, pizza, espresso and much more.  Sadly, many arrive with only a few days to experience Rome. This translates into rather predictable and fixed itineraries focused on major attractions like the Vatican, Coliseum and Roman Forum with a handful of other places squeezed into whatever time is left before visitors leave Rome. Short stays mean sticking to the beaten path in Rome, which leaves a world of very good attractions unexplored. Visitors who are able to stay a week in Rome have it much better. Simply put, longer stays mean more time to see the major attractions as well as other interesting and important places in Rome that wouldn't be possible during short city-break trips to Rome.  So what to see in Rome? Rome has a daunting amount of possibilities when it comes to drafting an itinerary. I always recommend spending some time flipping through a good travel guide for Rome for starters. I like the DK Eyewitness book. I also suggest scrolling through online resources like these TripAdvisor Rome 'Things to Do' pages. This is a good way to come up with a list of places to visit that are meaningful to you personally.  Note: You might want to spend time researching on the TripAdvisor Rome forum where you can post your draft itinerary, allowing local experts and regular visitors to Rome to critique your itinerary and offer thoughts and suggestions that might help you plan an even better visit.  In the end, Rome is not for everyone and that is ok. However, for many, it is a remarkable destination, one that they will remember for many years after their visit. To these people, research as much as you can and enjoy as much time in Rome as your time and money will allow! Hopefully you will have opportunity for future visits as well."

However, there are cities more remarkable for me, such as Prague, Stockholm, Salzburg, Moscow, St. Petersburg or Budapest.The historic centre is an indispensable place for who goes to Rome. However, the queue to visit the St. Peter Cathedral is horrible, as well as the Sistine Chapel. You must wait in the line more than one hour under the sun to reach the control machines in order to verify your belongings. Furthermore, women cannot show their shoulders or wear shorts or short salts, barred their entry.The cathedral is very beautiful, but you need to wait about two hours outside in the queue for spend 15 minutes watching the inside of the cathedral. For me, I preferred the surroundig areas of the Colosseum, the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon and other churches, fine dispersed by all the streets in Rome. Please take into account that many monuments of Rome are under restoration so, there are some limitations to the tourists."

The best way to see this area is on foot but if you're visiting Rome in the summer then it's going to be hard as temperatures are very high and the heat stifling. We preferred this area in the evening as it wasn't as hot and the atmosphere was better. If you eat/drink here then be prepared to pay a lot more though. The area is full of narrow streets, churches, museums, statues and beautiful squares and you can easily spend hours in this area. The main sights here are the Pantheon and Piazza Navona."

I came to Rome to study Italian and am almost halfway there, and this is the right area to do it. The people are warm and friendly, the food and wine is delicious and the culture... is just beautiful. The biggest advice I can give to anyone is to just skip all the commercial places, like the restaurants where they stand outside to lure you in, and just ask one of the locals what is the best place to eat here. There are many small, hidden restaurants that offer authentic quality food at very cheap prices. And most of the important monuments are for free. You can walk around for hours here and keep discovering new things. Avoid the dark Pakistani men that try to sell you crappy stuff: for example the selfie-stick is made for only 2 euro's and they try to sell it for 20. Avoid commercial restaurants around important places where they try to lure you in, such as Piazza Navona and the Pantheon: prices are too high and the quality is very bad. The locals here are very warm and friendly and will help you out with anything. Don't hesitate to ask. Enjoy your stay in Rome."

This building holds the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier so no-one is allowed to sit on the monument. At the back of the building is a glass lift for which you pay to take you to the top for spectacular views over Rome. I suggest you do this closer to closing time when you can get views of the sun setting and the lights of Rome. Nearby is Palazzo Venezia where Mussolini had his official residence and made speeches from the balcony. Inside is housed an eclectic collection of paintings, jewellery, tapestries etc. Just north of the Piazza Venezia is Palazzo Doria Pamphilj housing the Galleria Doria Pamphilj. This is a very undervisited museum and it still belongs to the Pamphilj family today. It is a must see for this museum and you can take photos by paying an extra E5 camera fee which was worth paying."

The entire historic city recognizes the value of more than 25,000 points of interest Most of the top attractions in Rome, excluding those on the left side of the river (Vatican side).The real heart in my opinion are the narrow winding streets which abound and are so enjoyable to meander down, attractions speak for themselves and are reviewed separately.

Amazing to see the curia where the senate used to meet, (not where Caesar was killed though, it's another curia). An extra was the church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, with a glass west wall. As you look down from it, you're looking into a real Pagan Roman temple! Then up the hill to the Aracoeli church, so magnificent and strangely different from other Roman churches - then onto the terrace of the Altare della Patria where there's a lovely rooftop caf\u00e9 bistro.

I just wandered wherever the wind blew me. Only in Rome does this work, as there isn't a block you'll walk where SOMETHING doesn't catch your interest (even if it's not listed in your guidebook). Was I ever lost ?... Constantly/Never (as you're only lost if you care). Wherever I was, eventually I'd see an iconic sign that would give me my bearings. This isn't for everyone, but I will attest - It was a treat to meander the street without the frustration of constantly trying to find myself on a map. Now, about the bus system...."

            "review": "Is there a more beautiful and interesting city centre anywhere?. The historic centre of Rome is small, but unbelievably packed with beautiful, interesting and wonderful things to see.Stand at the Pantheon for example and within 2 kilometres in each direction are dozens of unique attractions like the Colosseum, the Galleria Borghese, the Vatican and many others, charming, narrow, twisting cobbled streets, great restaurants and coffee shops, beautiful squares and parks and lovely shops. Every spot seems to contain something of interest to see - a statue, a church, a museum, a fountain, a column or obelisk, an ancient ruin, the river Tiber, or an interesting shop or bar, or even just the passing crowds. The colours of the buildings in the historic centre are also wonderful, lots of faded reds, yellows and pinks. They are greatly uplifting on a sunny, blue-sky day as do the unusual Roman pine trees.The whole of the historic centre can reasily be reached on foot, by metro or by bus or taxi. If you can, by foot is the best way. The metro is very easy to use as it only has 2 lines which cross Rome in an X shape with the intersection at Termini main train station. One arm of the X runs from south-west Rome, up past the Colosseum and on towards north-east Rome. The other runs from the direction of the Vatican down towards south-east Rome.Do consider getting a Roma pass for 30 euro before you go to Rome as this gives you free entry to your first 2 attractions, half-price to many more, plus it allows you to skip the ticket line which can be a real boon. The Roma pass also gives you 3 days free transport on the metro and buses. The Roma pass is very easy to use on the metro - you just press you Roma card on the ticket barriers and they open for you.The buses is Rome are also surprisingly easy to use and cover more of the historic centre than the metro.Also, it is worth considering getting a rental flat if you plan on being in Rome for a week or so. You can get some very nice central Rome flats for much less than a hotel room and getting a bit of food in for breakfast is very easy.All in all, if you have any interest in art, shopping, good food and wine, history, architecture, sculpture, and more, then you should make visiting Rome a priority."

Rome has some of the most amazing collection of antiquities on the planet - buildings, sculpture, ruins, you name it, much of it open to the public free of charge (although yes, elsewhere charges and queues can also be exorbitant).I have given it 1* not because of the sites themselves, which are 5* amazing, but because of the slack attitude of the authorities in terms of how they treat and welcome tourists. From the moment you land in the (grotty and outdated) airport and are directed towards the under-resourced and under-friendly \"tourist\" information there, the city itself does little to welcome and give real structure to tourism - initiatives are mostly in the hands of a few hotels and tour guides.Bathroom facilities around the sites are dirty and inadequate (and sometimes ask you to pay for the privilege nonetheless!), and not enough has been done to promote accessibility for those with movement difficulties. That goes for the public transport and the narrow pavements too.The free maps are also pretty bad (ok so you can buy better ones, but I have also seen more effort made at producing decent maps and brochures in other cities).On the plus side, public transport is cheap (apart from taxis, which are ridiculous - we paid anything between Eur 12 and Eur 25 for the same distance), but the Metro is limited in scope.I laughed out loud when I heard Rome was thinking of bidding for the 2020 Olympics - thank goodness that has been shelved, the city's ageing infrastructure can barely cope with the tourists as is.In short, the sites of Rome are amazing, the city of Rome in terms of its infrastructure and attitude to tourism, is not."

I'd always had misgivings about spending time in Rome. Many reviews have made it sound like it's populated solely by annoying tourists and local pickpockets. We're not really interested in old works of art, especially of a religious nature. We rarely attend museums. I don't like to wait in lines and absolutely hate feeling like I'm spending money foolishly. But refusing to yield to my wife's wishes comes with a heavy penalty. So Roma it was.What a delightful surprise this City was. Granted, it's undoubtedly a different experience in January than July. But the people were friendly and polite. We never once felt threatened or at risk of being robbed. In fact, we can't recall anyone being even a bit rude to us in an entire month. This is a walker's paradise. We averaged at least 5 hours out on the sidewalks each day and never once had a boring stroll. When people say there are surprises around every corner they mean it literally. On both macro and micro levels the city is fascinating. Seeing remnants of 2000 year old buildings doesn't just happen at the sites you read about- any block may have its hidden treasures. There's always something interesting to see. And spending a lot of money while you're doing it isn't necessary. Public transportation is cheap and accessible. Good meals can be found everywhere at prices that are cheap compared to cities such as New York or London. The society is pretty relaxed. Drinking wine or beer while having a panino in a public piazza or park is commonplace. While we'd heard that there's been an upsurge in illicit drug use we only smelled marijuana twice in a month and were never approached by drug dealers.The food was memorable. Everyone finds their favorite pizzerias and neighborhood restaurants but the quality of the markets makes cooking at home a great option too. Eating well is just an integral part of life here. Italian is not an easy language to learn. Knowing a bit of French or Spanish may help a little but it also complicates things. Fortunately, a lot of people speak at least some English and the ones that don't generally seem pretty good-humored about communicating via gestures and a few mispronounced words from either language. Listening to natives speak Italian to each other is a different matter. It's such a pretty and expressive language to the ear- which may help to explain why people seem to be talking constantly. Watching the way hand gestures are incorporated into the message was fun too. Even when people were talking on cell phones the free hand had to be moving at all times. Face to face it was like a ballet for the hands.A person could easily stay in the outer areas of Rome, spend 35 euros for a month's transit pass, and just ride into the old part of town every day to see the sites. It's an attractive and potentially inexpensive option. But there really is something special about staying in the historic center of the City. As much as it hurts to say this, my wife was right about staying in Rome..."

I am very critical of things I visit. But there is nothing to be criticized about Rome. Oh yes. One thing though. And hopefully the Roman authorities will read this. Bottles of water in the tourist area are too expensive. 2-4 Euros for a bottle of 50CL is way to much. Just imagine you are a family of 5 and you stay the whole day outside and have to drink a minimum of 1,5L per person, it will cost you just in water for the whole day: 30 Euros - and when it is too hot like in the summer, you might have to double or triple that amount. Here the authorities should do something. Either build fountains, like in the USA, or democratize the price of the water. In the meantime, my advise is: take lots of water from the Supermarket with you. Just a bottle of 50cl can cost no more than 13 cents if you get it a the right place. That is, if you visit Rome during a very hot summer and you drink about 3l in a day for a family of 5, it will cost you only: 1,95 Euros."

One tip: don't overbook your time here. Leave time to stroll and get lost, to grab a coffee or a drink at some little place, and watch the world go by. Get off the beaten path and wander and discover something wonderful. For example, if you happen to walk along Via del Pie\u2019 di Marmo (marble foot street), you will find, sitting on a pedestal, a giant marble foot from an ancient Roman statue. That's the beauty of Rome, the Eternal City."

The Palatino \"Hill\" barely counts as a hill for most people but trainers are better than open toed sandals as it is dusty and stoney.

It is a maze of narrow streets where people live next to some amazing monuments like the Trevi Fountain, Hadrian Wall, the Pantheon and as far as Piazza Navona. There are charming caf\u00e9s and restaurants, small shops, wine bars and an array of interesting shop windows. One of them sells wooden toys among which the famed Pinocchio! This is a UNESCO site and it is really worth walking it through and through to discover more hidden treasures."

If you are going to Rome over the summer months I would advise visiitng the centro storico early in the morning to avoid the intense heat as there is no shade or cover to escape the sun. It's also amazing when lit up late at night and they've started to sell tickets for nightitme visits but you need to book these in advance.We bought a Roma Pass which gives you unlimited travel on the metro, buses and trams and free entry into yout first two museums or attractions, The coloseum and roman forum count as one entry.  The coloseum literally took my breath away with it's magnificence, it is just an amazing feat of architecture and amazing that the model is still used today when building modern stadia. The Roman forum is also a must see. Augustus's palace with its mosaics still intact, the curia where the senate sat to the various temples, vesta, saturn etc., will produce goose bumps. You can hire a hand held guide from the ticket booth but will have to leave your passports until you return them or canu se a good guide book.Allow a couple of hours at least to see both the colosseum and the forum."

We were in Rome this week and it was amazing- temerature was around 30 C, and last week of August, so this is the 'quiet season', but it was busy with tourist groups from all around the world. Centro Storico has so many monuments to see - but if you get confused, then take advantage of the many tourist information booths in the city. They have multilingual staff and will provde free maps which list all the key attractions. These maps were also available in our hotel and as you wander through the city you will see many tourists using the maps to guide them.When we went to the Colosseum the lines were of course long, so we walked the 10 minutes to the Palatine ticket booth, queued there for 20 minutes to buy our tickets - and when we went into the Colosseum we were glad we had bought the tickets as the lines to get in, are a long way into the building itself ! Note that for EU citizens under 18 entry is free - you may be asked for ID at the ticket booth so we took our passports long. For 18-24 the price for Colosseum was 7.5 Euros.We found that around 90 minutes was enough to see the Colosseum (we did not have a guide, used a guide book instead)"

This spectacular because these structures are thousands of years old and there are a bunch of them in one concentrated area. I would suggest purchasing water and other fluids before you get to this area because everything gets really expensive. If possible, freeze your water bottles and just keep refiling them at the fountains."

Off-the-beaten-path monuments include the Ara Pacis and the Crypta Balbi, both really interesting and pretty empty, which is an amazing thing in central Rome, believe me. You must have a map to find anything, or you'll probably end up going in the opposite direction you intended. Not that it matters in the end, because you'll find something interesting no matter where you end up, but if you need to be someplace in particular a map is a necessity."

            "review": "Do as the Romans did--Walk It!. It\u2019s very important to experience Rome by foot. I realize that the city can be exhausting with so many museums, churches & ruins to visit; however, you'll be missing the spirit of Rome if you don\u2019t walk the streets. Most major landmarks are connected by very simple & scenic streets that run parallel to the major, traffic-ridden streets. Don\u2019t be afraid to take these streets. They offer many surprises & treats.VIA ALESSANDRINA. If you are walking between the Coliseum/Forum & the Victor Emmanuel II Monument, please take the time to walk on Via Alessandrina, which runs parallel to the Via dei Fori Imperiali\u2014the main street leading to/from the Coliseum/Forum. Via Alessandrina begins by Trajan\u2019s Column and runs beside Trajan\u2019s Market before merging back into Via dei Fori Imperiali. You won\u2019t get lost by using Via Alessandrina since Via dei Fori Imperiali is visible from Alessandrina. Plus, Via Alessandrina is mostly a pedestrian street, so you\u2019ll have a little break from the crazy traffic. A stop at Trajan\u2019s Column is worth your time. The relief carvings on the column are the deepest, sharpest & most impressively designed in Rome. It\u2019s elaborate & beautiful\u2014not only a testament to Emperor Trajan\u2019s power but also to his craftsmen that designed & executed the column. At the base of Trajan\u2019s Column is an excavated area with column stumps & ruins, which you can\u2019t see from Via dei Fori Imperiali, so get up close to the column. Behind the column is the church Santa Marie di Loreto, which could provide a cool refuge in the summer heat. Its octagonal floor plan under a wide dome is calming & peaceful. Along Via Alessandrina, you\u2019ll see the Trajan Market, which is very impressive in height, scale & design. You can walk down into the ruins a little by the side of the street & see some nice tile work.VIA DEL TEATRO MARCELLO. If you are visiting the Capitoline Museum, start at the front of the Victor Emmanuel II Monument and walk Via del Teatro Marcello to the base of the Capitoline Hill. You will pass a neglected but strong Roman ruin, the Insula Romana Ara Coeli, which is an apartment building from 200 A.D. The ancient apartments are overshadowed by the side of the Victor Emmanuel II Monument and largely forgotten. It\u2019s just standing there, ignored. But it\u2019s a fascinating ruin, and as the building\u2019s ground floor is far below the current street level, one can imagine that the apartments must have been ancient Rome\u2019s proud skyscrapers at one point. If you look closely, you\u2019ll find an ancient fresco of Jesus\u2019 last supper (I think), by one of the building\u2019s windows. It\u2019s still amazingly well defined & fresh. It's too bad that many tourists don\u2019t walk this route. You shouldn\u2019t miss this! And when you pass the Romana Ara Coeli, you\u2019ll be at the base of Michelangelo\u2019s grand staircase entry into the Capitoline Hill. This is the intended entry to the hill & museum, and therefore the best route to take. VIA CORONARI. After visiting Piazza Navonna, if you're headed to the Ponte Sant\u2019Angelo to either access Castel Sant\u2019Angelo or the Vatican, then take Coronari Street. Between these megastar landmarks is this medieval lane. It\u2019s a beautiful experience. You can access Via Coronari directly at the end of Piazza Navonna, where four streets intersect at the Piazza Tor Sanguigna. One of the intersecting streets is the start of Coronari Street. Also at this intersection, there is a hole that exposes an entombed ancient level beneath the foundations of one building. If one leans into the hole, the remains materialize of Emperor Domitian\u2019s Stadium, constructed in 86 A.D. One of the stadium\u2019s terrace arches is viewable & astonishingly preserved. When you pass the stadium ruins, head onto the cobblestoned Coronari Street; it\u2019s the small street, the one that is no wider than the shoulders of five large men standing side to side. Coronari was part of Pope Sixtus IV\u2019s urban renewal project in the early 1400s, along with the Sistine Chapel. Its peak traffic was during the late Middle Ages, when pilgrims used the street to walk towards the Vatican. Knowing the pilgrims\u2019 path, merchants lined the route with rosaries for sale; so, the street became called Via dei Coronari since rosary beads were referred to as crowns of beads\u2014coronari. On the street, you\u2019ll find building shrines & many antique shops. Even if you don't care to shop, here you can absorb a classic Roman spirit. Coronari buildings exude Italian shabby-chic\u2014peeling plasters of earth-colors, predominately parched browns & bleached oranges. The doorways are tight, often lined with white marble. There are climbing plants on the walls & charming shuttered windows. This is the Rome that many of us imagine prior to visiting. Coronari will end on the street that becomes Ponte Sant\u2019Angelo, so you will not get lost on this street. VIA DEI PASTINI / VIA DELLE MURATTE. If you are traveling between the Pantheon & Trevi Fountain, take Via dei Pastini which is called Via delle Muratte once you pass the major street, Via del Corso. You\u2019ll pass a lot of buildings with corner shrines & also pass the side of the Italian Stock Exchange which incorporated the ancient and COLOSSAL columns from the Temple of Hadrian, which used to stand here. The temple columns are very impressive! Along this route you\u2019ll also find a mix of specialty arts & craft shops as well as tacky touristy souvenir shops. So if you\u2019re looking to buy souvenirs\u2014ranging from unique art to funny kitschy, this is the street. When the street becomes Via delle Muratte on the other side of Via del Corso, it becomes a pedestrian street--no cars. The shopping also becomes livelier & tackier. There are long rows of market stalls here with paper souvenirs\u2014postcards, posters, etc. Sometimes street performers provide entertainment on the Via delle Muratte part of the road, closer to the Trevi Fountain. At the end of Via delle Muratte, you\u2019ll be facing the Trevi Fountain. Very fun street!"

Oh the history!Fast forward a few thousand years and it's amazing how far we've come. This was the first time I navigated Rome with an Ipad and how helpful it was with Google Maps on the Ipad. Even with no data plan, we didn't have ANY problems at all always getting the map up on the Ipad. It's great going through all the ancient streets. In the back of the Colosseum there are some tiny streets and some have cafes and restaurants on them. It's fun to purposely get lost on some of these small streets.Although there are TONS of tourists during the summer, it's still fairly easy to navigate and there are many crosswalks and almost all have signals and those that don't the traffic is good about yielding to pedestrians which is nice.We had 2 strollers with our young kids and we easily made it around with crowds being good when they see you with kids."

All loved the colosseum but the children really didn't see the point of visiting the Palatine. It rather disappointed us too; it's not that the buildings are in such a poor ruined state (although they are!) but that there are very few explanations of what you are looking at and almost no pictures to help children visualise what was there. Even with the 'Rome Reconstructed' book in hand (very good) it was difficult to imagine the historical reality from the actual sights before us. The Forum was better for them so we would advise to do the Colosseum 1st, the Forum 2nd and the Palatine last (treating it mostly like a lovely walk so it can't disappoint.)It was difficult to know how to work out the benefits of the Roma Pass with the children because there does not seem to be sufficient information readily available online re discounts and travel costs etc. In the end we bought here in Rome 2 Roma Passes for us (now 30E) and have got the children in to all the 'antiquity' sites for free (EU passport holders only.) We found that the cost of transport is low generally so we have saved money by not buying the pass for them. The passes were great though because we were all able to bypass the very long Colosseum queue and go straight in. A real blessing at 27C!"

Having traveled the world over, Rome is easily a top five favorite place for us and for very good reason. The historical importance of Rome, a easy UNESCO World Heritage sight choice, and it's role in shaping the development of western society, religion and civilization are beyond need to explain. And there is so much to do, see, taste and experience here that is meaningful, magnificent and memorable in nature, that it can be difficult to explain. It is a place that iconic structures, buildings, squares, fountains and scenes known the world over. It is a place that almost everybody recognizes and few can forget. Visiting Rome, in our view, is like walking back into our world's history, allowing us to experience, appreciate and hopefully learn something about why our modern world is shaped the way it presently is, why it operates the way it does and why we live our lives the way we do. Much of these answers stem from Roman and (Holy See) history which have so greatly contributed to how we view and interact in the world around us today. Philosophically speaking, all roads still lead back to Rome. The opportunity to spend time in the city center in Rome is simply special, something everyone can hopefully try to experience at least once in their lifetime. The attractions that you can see and experience here seem endless, many that shouldn't be missed even during the shortest of visits to Rome. Here are a few that should be included in all visitors 'must see' list of things to do while visiting the city centre. 1.) Vatican Museum 2.) St. Peter's Basilica3.) Colosseum, Roman and Imperial Forum4.) Pantheon 5.) Piazza Navona and the Trevi FountainIf you only have one day in Rome, you make sure that you see the list of attractions above. If you have more time, you can consider other outstanding, wondrous attractions within the city. Some are included below. 6.) San Giovanni in Laterano and Santa Scala7.) Basilica di San Clemente8.) Santa Maria Maggiore9.) Santa Passade10.) Santa Maria della Vittorio11.) Galleria Borghese and Villa Borghese12.) Museo National Romano13.) Museo Capitolini 14.) Piazza di Spagna (Spanish Steps)15.) Piazza del PopoloAnd there are many more very good spots to consider when visiting the city, these are just some of the most important, special and memorable that we've been fortunate enough to have experienced during trips to Rome over the years. This is a city that we will probably always go back to. Its just that good!"

The area is compact, the major sites are close to each other. The area is safe (except for pickpockets) can be walked at any hour of the day or night and always seems to be alive.Turn any corner and be surprised, look in any window and see something new, or old. Avoid restaurants with menus that are posted on the street with hawkers trying to drag you in. But the folks that do the work of hawking, when acknowledged, are polite and friendly. Some sights never seem to quiet down, the Trevi Fountain being one of them. All sights that take reservations should be reserved in advance. Walk, walk, walk. Eat, drink, watch. There is no other place like Rome."

We stayed in via del Governo Vecchio, between Piazza Navona and the Ponte San Angelo for a month - eat your hearts out! ....In an apartment with bed, bath and kitchen, for Euros 1400 for 32 nights. Hunt for the good things at right price - away from top of season, before the Centro is invaded by the barbarians from the north!Walking out is a sheer joy. The eye adapts to natural pigment paint, with its faded and varied finish, and to the enormous diversity of architecture and life, from building to building, street to street. You may take an academic interest in this or that, you may just bathe with exuberance in the aesthetic experience.It is good to go to shop for food and to restaurants a little further away. A sound basic rule is 'not within one hundred metres of a tourist site' - which is of course hard anywhere in the 'Centro Storico'.Our device for getting through to the other end of the centro, when feet tired or time gone, was to find the 116 bus. It is one of several small electric buses specifically designed to run on narrow streets. Hopefully this link will give you the route map going from the Tiber end to the Villa Borghese:http://trovalinea.atac.roma.it/zoom_in.asp?VediSemafori=off&VediMeb=off&VediParcometri=off&VediFermate=off&VediLinee=off&VediRivendite=off&percorso=116R&idmtram=52173&xmax=2312274&ymax=4643811&xmin=2309287&ymin=4640755&tipologia=URB&linea=116&circo=NOand here is my handheld-behind-driver's-head movie of part of the trip."
