Hong Kong used to be British so the town-planning is similar - there must be a park within the central business district for people to breathe and this is it. The Hong Kong equivalent of the Hyde Park in London or the Central Park in Manhattan - it's just a lot smaller. It serves the same purpose though. When you are tired of all the paper work in the office, or of the shopping mall in Pacific Place nearby, come and breathe in the fresh air. Look at the flowers. Stare at the lake. This park keeps all of us sane."

HK park is right next door to many hotels, the superb Pacific Place shopping mall and bang in the middle of Centra's business district. I have walked through it many times and also eaten at the restaurant in the middle (great Thai green curry). Also have a lovely picture of my (then) 2 year old daughter walking through it that I cherish."

The fish pond and aviary are little gems in the middle of a very crowded city. It's location near the main streets and shopping was a plus and made it an easy get away. Our kids loved the turtles (Can't really explain why, but they did). A pleasant walk and activity for an hour."

Again a great use of space which is much needed in busy HK"

There were many things to see - the excellent aviary with a tree canopy walkway, the pond with turtles and fish, the informative Flagstaff house museum of tea and the conservatory which houses lovely orchids and other plants. We had a good lunch in a Thai/fusion restaurant inside the park itself. It was indeed a lovely day spent in a hidden oasis among the concrete jungle."

Of course, there are more interesting places, but I didn't visit them all.It is a nice place for a walk."

It is, by far, the prettiest of the many parks I have visited in the whole of China*, and also one of the very few that are free of charge. There are greenhouses, flower exhibistions, gorgeous little streams, waterfalls and ponds filled with fishes and turtles, all accompanied with the genlte buzzing of dragonflies. There are a few small museums with excellent English descriptions. The aviary holds beautiful birds, in what appears to be very good living conditions. All in all, this is a beautiful park that breaks the chaos of the crowded city. The contrast of verdant trees against the monolithic skyscrapers is especially stunning. *Hong Kong isn't actually a part of China, but well, you know what I mean."

There are plenty of places to bring food and water and there are seats to sit and take in the scenery. There are a number of hidden gems inside including the aviary which has a wonderful collection of birds which are easy to approach - great for kids or photographers. It is easy to access the park from a number of directions including escalators from Admiralty. The only small downside is that much of the park is on a hillside so there are some stairs and slopes if you want to walk all around."

Aviary has many varieties of birds to see, also a smaller caged bird section. A must see. Stroll through park has large pond with turtles, fish, and other water plants. There's a man-made waterfall that you can walk behind to the conservatory with different kinda of plants. Beautifully curated. A few other sites like a small art exhibit, tea house (has a restaurant inside).There's a playground area also, though more suitable for younger aged kids. To get there from the Admiralty MTR station, we asked the locals to direct us. Ended up going up a set of escalators which ran through a mall. "

Unfortunately, Hong Kong Park is not a \"park\" in the usual sense of a city centre park, but more a nature trail built into the side of the hill going up and down slopes and stairs.I was looking forward to the aviary, but it closes at 17:00 along with the conservation exhibit, so get there early if you want to experience those. The nature walk is rather nice, and the Tai Chi garden is peaceful. There's also an Olympic arena from last decade to explore, and a waterfall going down into an artificial lake beside the fountain plaza. I would not say that the park is an essential sight of Hong Kong, and it is not as peaceful as people seem to make it out to be. Nevertheless, it is nice for a small trip if you are in the area."

It's fairly hilly in parts so pace yourself and make sure you check out the opening times of the exhibits/aviary before heading over (I believe they close around 5). There is a fountain near the Pacific Place entrance which you can walk into - I often see people taking an I'm-dry-but-totally-just-walked-through-water-HOW?! photo here!

It is now the Museum of Tea Ware which showcases various tea wares from the Tang Dynasty until more modern teapots and times; promoting pottery and porcelain wares, part of the tradition of Chinese tea Culture. Teapots range from the exquisite to the amusing; traditional teapots through to quirky modern imaginative creations. Open 10:00 to 18:00 closed Tuesdays.Just inside the main Admiralty entrance is the Fountain Plaza which includes a large mushroom shaped water feature, on a hot day walk under the overhanging water feature, your feet may get a little damp though you remain dry under the umbrella shaped feature.From the large artificial lake walk over the arched bridge, and behind the waterfall to get to the Forsgate Conservatory. From this location photographers can get fabulous images of some of the gleaming high-rise buildings including IFC2 rising from behind the foreground of colourful shrubbery. The impressive Conservatory is the largest in S.E. Asia and features exotic flowers, trees, and plants in various climate controlled pavilions. Dozens of prickly Cacti from dry regions, and lush ferns and pathways cooled by a trickling stream.The 3,000 square metre walk-through Edward Youde Aviary is built over a natural valley on the N.E. slope of Victoria Peak. Named after a Governor of Hong Kong during British rule, the aviary comprises bird species indigenous of S.E. Asia, New Guinea, and Indonesia. The highest point of the aviary is 46.5 metres. Broad wooden elevated walkways wind under a canopy of natural vegetation. A small stream provides water and cooling to the site. The aviary is seldom crowded."

Waterfalls, a Thai Chi park and even a little wedding ministry can be found. You can stay 5 minutes or 2 hours. It is up to you! You feel relaxed and get to take deep breaths in the silence of this picturesque park. And when you look up, you are always remembered that you are in the heart of Hong Kong by seeing the big skyscrapers. Awww, I want to go back!"

Its also great for those of you who like taking photos.

As you climb further you reach the memorial to the medical workers killed by SARS within the Tai Chi garden (the tower of 105 steps does have great views) and finally you reach the lovely walk through aviary which is very worthwhile and the birds will come quite close.

There is also the Conservatory, an interesting and pleasant displays of dry and wet climate plants. A restaurant with outside terrace, L-16, also provides a variety of choices for food and drinks at reasonable price. (The Olympic Square theatre and the Tai Chi Garden section were of less obvious interest to me, except that the observation tower included in the Tai Chi section allows for great views over park and the city. The park has a handful of access points, but the two most convenient in my opinion are the escalator through Pacific Place mall (MTR Admiralty) and the bridge overpass to and from Citybank/ICBC Towers (MTR Central)."

There are walkways, fountains, an artificial lake, a superb aviary (see below), a couple of museums and a marriage centre. It is very hilly and you can spend a lot of energy hiking up and down. It is amazing that this park seems so hidden away, yet it is quite spacious.There is a huge aviary that is very well designed. We have been to aviaries around the world and this is our favourite so far. You enter at the top and proceed down a pleasant wide wooden walkway to the exit at the bottom. Many bird species are present, including some that you really have to work to see. Some are friendly and some hide away as much as possible.This is a great place for a budding bird photographer. There are endless opportunities for experimentation and practice because there are birds everywhere. There are stopping places at frequent intervals so you do not get in the way if you stop to look or take a picture.It is free."

It's set in the foothills so the paths are steep - parents with buggies and mobility challenged would have difficulty. The map of the park makes it look huge but in reality everything is quite closely packed which means you can move seamlessly from the rather too build up zen gardens to the walk through aviary. Be warned the cages large birds to the side of the aviary are a depressing sight but the walk through aviary is simply stunning. Beautiful big space for birds to swoop in. You walk along a raised path so the birds can be above or below you. Look out for camouflaged green birds hidden in the trees. The lake is pleasant with a lovely surprise of tonnes of turtles piling themselves into the rocks and swimming with the fish. The toilets at the entrance are surprisingly clean and well maintained with a choice of squat or European style. All in all a lovely wander"

A must visit"

As others have said, it is a lovely place of peace and calm after the bustle of Hong Kong. We were fortunate that the park was decorated for the Chinese New Year. There were many locals taking advantage of the displays to take their photos in front of them.There were several stands for purchasing craft goods and there was also a museum in the centre of the park about tea.

Tea Museum was closed on the day we visited so can't comment but did enjoy the wee restaurant inside the park.Handy to The Peak and easy to get to."

Once you enter it, it feels you are in a jungle. We encountered lots of birds, several of them perched on the banisters, just an arm's length away. Had fun taking lots of photos with the birds at such close quarters."

The place is free of admission and very near to the terminal for the Victoria peak tram. A quite garden with tall trees. HK park features a sizable Aviary, caged birds display, tai chi court, observatory tower, conservatory, a colosseum, artificial lakes, waterfall, river, wedding registry house, museum of teaware, a gallery, two fountains and a restaurant. Early in the morning, the Aviary has already been visited by bird watchers and bird photographers, the birds are not too plenty, probably 12 species, some can be sighted within 1-2 meters. The tai chi court displays a not so impressive Chinese architecture and garden, older people are doing tai chi there. Inside the tai chi court is a 105 steps observatory tower viewing 360 degree of the park, including view to the white-blue Saint John\u2019s cathedral and the iconic Bank of China office tower. The conservatory has two parts, dry plants and humid plants. Cacti displays with government warning not to touch the plant. The humid plant is more interesting with gushing water and humid air displaying ferns and green plants. The lakes has some waterfall and they have turtle on \u201cislands\u201d, with nice view to the skycrapers behind the trees. The wedding registry is a small building, conserved for its historical significance. The museum of teaware and KS Lo gallery is nearby. A museum of teawares inside HK park near the exit. An old architecture building, known as the Flagstaff House, some part undergone renovation and inaccessible. The display is disappointingly as some looks like replicas rather than the real ones. It highlights many design of teapots during many era of Chinese culture. But mostly are from more recent era, after 1800s. Two water fountains at the exit. HK park is much nicer than Kowloon park.The museum of teaware/ Flagstaff House is the oldest remaining western architecture in HK. The museum is sponsored by the founder of Vitasoy, a maker of popular soy drinks."

I love just walking around, seeing the trees, then looking up and seeing the buildings right behind looking down at you. As the buildings themselves are very nice it works well.There is a fountain here that a lot of people enjoy running into, just be careful on the steps into the fountain as they can get a bit slippery.There are ponds there with fish and turtles and I think one has frogs in it that I could hear but could never see, maybe you can find them?It costs nothing, you can walk in and enjoy the scenery. If you enjoy taking lots of photos when on holiday you will find lots of good photos to take here.There are toilets and food to buy too. Definitely worth a visit."

There are several entrances/exits, you may come from the entrance near Pacific Place from the east, or near Peak Tram Terminal from the west. This park is managed by the City Council/government, gardeners changed the pots of flowers and decorations according to seasons and festivals. Look forward to see the peach blossoms in Chinese New Year in early February this year."

So the advice is to go during the week. The highlight is the main bird aviary - a huge net covered expanse with not-so-timid birds of all varying shapes and sizes endemic to HK. The lowlight is that there are other birds that are not displayed in the main aviary and it was quite sad to see majestic hornbills displayed in individual cages with no room to fly."

Because the park is on a hill, the views of HK's most famous high-rises is spectacular. The Park houses the botanical gardens and the Flagstaff Tea Museum, where you can stop for some tea and snacks in a handsome restored mansion. On weekends, you can watch countless newly married couples pose for photographs in their wedding garb. The entrance to the park is on the downhill side, across the street from the Conrad Hotel. Don't try to get in from the uphill edge. Take the MTR to Admiralty Station and walk through the mall to the Park entrance."

Hence we may have set our expectations too high. It is a nice park for a morning stroll, but it just can't compare with other gardens we have visited, even back home in Singapore.The children's playground was disappointing. It was no different from what we can easily find in Singapore's housing estates. No special interesting features, hence my kids lost interest pretty quickly.The aviary was small, similar in size to the lory loft in Jurong Bird park. The birds were accustomed to being around humans, and weren't easily startled. Good photo opportunities there.The conservatory was located on top of a flight of steps. After seeing the lack-lustre aviary, we thought the conservatory may not be worth the effort and skipped it.The lake and the waterfall were just ok.By all means, take a stroll around if you happen to be in the vicinity. But I would not make a special effort to go."

There are ponds with huge fish and turtles, rivers, and fountains. The park is very peaceful despite it being well used and quite small for the attractions that it fits in.There is both an indoor and outdoor aviary, a hot house and a tea museum. There is a lovely garden area with a monument to victims of SARS ; in this garden there is a tower which you can climb. This has wonderful views of the city; it also has two sets of stairs, one for up and another for down. I must say that this was ignored by some visitors. If you just want somewhere to sit quietly and watch the world go by or visit low key bird or flower exhibits, you could do worse than visiting Hong Kong Park."

I don't think anyone will be interested to visit this place in the dark, unless you want to be alone with your partner and want a romantic spot. Because besides that, there is really nothing do as the aviaries will be closed. There is a restaurant still opened though. My friend and I walked from Central MTR, onto Battery Path, passing by the Cathedral and cheung Kong Park. Long route, but it was interesting to visit it at night. Foreigners selling handbags, shirts along the way. You can even see the skyscrapers. Shorter route would be from Admiralty MTR."

The Aviary has a raised walkway that allows visitors to walk through a tree canopy from where the many species of birds can be seen and photographed. The walkway through the aviary is also wheelchair/baby stroller accessible. The valley floor of the aviary has a stream bed full of trees and shrubs, adorned with shallow pools and waterfalls, providiing visitors with many opportunities to see the many species of birds. Display panels showing illustrations of the many bird species are provided along the length of the walkway to aid in identification of the bird species. The conservatory is a big enclosure with a number of display areas of many different species of plants. It is well laid out and also worth a visit.

It also has a conservatory with 3 different climatic conditions - Dry, Humid & the display plant house. Fantastic for kids to learn about various birds & plant life. It also has a reasonably sized play area for the kids. The entire park is stroller friendly, though I must warn that it is quite a bit of exercise for us parents to push them up & down the park. Bottom line: HK park is a mirage in the middle of the city, a miniature version of the Central Park, though built on a hill. A great place to spend half a day or so there."

To get to this park, the best way is through Admiralty's Pacific Place - take the escalators up on the second floor of the mall, cross the road and you'll find the park's entrance. To get to the hidden greenhouse, head uphill and follow the signs. You can actually reach the visual arts centre, a small gallery displaying local artists' work, by following a path (signs show route) and it could be a nice resting spot (there's air conditioning!). My favourite part of the park is being able to see all the tall buildings surrounding it, while being surrounded by green."

Walking further brought to another section of the lake were turtles and fishes co-exist. I believe I saw at least two species of turtles. Next stop was the Conservatory. A man-made waterfalls welcomed us as we climb our way to the entrance. The Conservatory has four sections: indoor plants, plants in dry environment, plants in humid environment, and one section that was closed I couldn't remember. The collection of flowering plants, ferns, trees, vines was just astonishing. It was sensory overload for me, I was nauseous from being exposed to such beauty. I'm not even exaggerating. I learned about plants that need a lot of water, plants that don't and they are not just from the cactus family, and found ferns and plants that I would like to be the soil cover for my garden back home, instead of the usual Bermuda or carabao grass. The park has two aviaries. The first one had birds in cages. The second one is a walk-through type were you can experience bring up close with the birds in their almost natural habitat. The aviary didn't contain birds of prey such as Eagles and falcons, not even owls but mostly it contained small to medium size birds that feed on insects and fruits. A well-equipped camera will be an advantage. It's a must see-must experience park."

No visit to Hong Kong should come to a close without a few strolls through the Hong Kong Park, which has its own aviary, a museum, wedding chapel, and several other attractions. Wedding watchers may enjoy seeing the luxury autos rolling up to disgorge brides, grooms, parents, and photographers. A work-mate of mine used to point out that on the west side of the park the \"wedding chapel\" sign is right next to the \"toilet\" sign, which didn't seem to put the prospect of getting married in a very good light. I frequently sit by the pond, check in on the turtles, and read a chapter or two from whatever tome I'm lugging around. It's a good locale to people watch. There is also a restaurant on the east side of the park which changes hands every couple of years. The last time some of us went there it was good. Just NE of the park is the Pacific Place mall, so you can duck into the park after a rough afternoon of shopping. Or you can hang out for 20 minutes while waiting for the movie to start. Hong Kong newlyweds (even if they haven't been married in the park) frequently come there to have photos taken, so there is quite a bit of local color about on the weekends. Graduates in their caps and gowns also come there for family photos. Always a fun and interesting locale. Enjoy."

It's a huge park in the middle of the city, surrounded by huge buildings. But once in this park, you'll forget about everything that's outside of it. There's lots to see and do. There's a garden, a swimmingpool, an aviary. And when you're ready, you can return back to the madness outside :)."

I took the kids (5yo and 2yo) to Hong Kong Park twice: once with my husband, and the other time by myself, with the kids in the pram.Here are my thoughts / advice based on those visits:* Do go! - it is a little slice of nature in the middle of the Hong Kong concrete jungle. It is such an amazing contrast to be sat inside the park, surrounded by skyscrapers. My kiddies loved the lake (especially the turtles and fishes) and the waterfall. I suspect that the Aviary would be more appreciated by children older than my own.* The park itself is on a significant slope, and there are lots of stairs (including between the different levels in the playground!) ... which made it interesting for me when I was by myself with the kids in the pram! I believe that you MAY be able navigate your way through the park without using the stairs at all (definitely not the case in the playground ... as you can only do it using the stairs), but you would need to take a photo of the map on the way in and keep referring back to it, as it is a little bit of a maze. On my two visits, I saw several people struggling up and down the stairs with their prams.* The playground is quite dated, and really only suitable for toddlers. My 5yo was bored within a few minutes, though my 2yo would have been happy to play for longer.* There are Park employees there to make sure that people are not sitting / walking where they shouldn't be ... so it isn't a park where you can be at ease and let the little ones let off lots of steam!* The toilets were incredibly clean!As the Park is incredibly close to the lower terminal of the Peak Tram, we visited after a trip up to The Peak, and it was a really comfortable day for the kiddies (i.e. not \"too much\" crammed into one day)."

I did see a few photographers with heavy professional gear for birds on my way as this is one of the 2 parks where the government organises bird viewing morning tours regualrly for free. Despte the disappointments for me, fairly speaking this park is conveniently located with enough eateries and washrooms. The ponds, trees, paths, flowers, fish, tortoises and greenhouse (which is very clean and comfortable) on the gentle slopes around make this clean park in the urban area a nice area for wedding and general family photography."

Access to the park: easiest way is to take the MTR to admiralty station, find the exit to Queensway (the Pacific Place exit is actually further away which you have to walk through the entire shopping mall). Once you are in Queensway, take the bridge to Pacific Place, go up the escalators and you will see sign pointing you to the HK Park. There will be many locals resting in the park during lunch on weekdays so if you want to have a more quiet time, you can go past 2pm on weekday or any time during weekends. Food - There is a Tea shop (which serves vegetarian dim sum) inside the Tea Museum, they are famous for their tea. It's not expensive, so it's a good spot for lunch or a quite bite. If you would like more substantial food, go to the other restaurant just across it's called L16, both outdoor and indoor seating. Enjoy yourself in the park, there are quite a lot to see and you will feel yourself surround by high rise buildings which you might not find anywhere else! Around the park - From there, you can take the bridge to Central and visit St John's Cathedral and have a drink in Lan Kwai Fong!"

We visited this park a few times during our 2 week stay in Hong Kong - great if you're travelling with toddlers (we had our twin 2.5 year olds with us). Great location (right off the MTR). Not very large park, but jammed with lots of things to do (as far as toddlers go). They have fountains that you can actually walk into; ponds full of turtles and Koi, waterfalls, Aviary, HUGE multi-layer playground, and what was most important for us: SHADE (we were travelling in the dead heat of HK Summer). Some days we made a special trip to the Park for the kids, other days, we strolled through it after visiting other closeby attractions. We liked it as it wasn't very packed or busy (of course that could be because we were the only ones crazy enough to be outside in the blistering heat!). The park was very clean, with many staff stationed at key points to help direct you to where you want to go. We were very grateful for this Park smack in the hustle and bustle of the City."

Make sure you visit the Aviary and climb the viewing tower. The tai chi gardens are peaceful and well landscaped if a bit dated. The ponds section is always busier. Good tea/bar options means its a good rest spot"

The day I went it was pretty crowded, and a little touristy too I guess, since it is located in the heart of HK. So if you are looking for complete peace or silence, this is not place, you should visit Chi Lin Nunnery. Otherwise HK park is a great place to catch a breather during a busy day. There are small shops / vendors selling interesting knick-knacks."

It was turned into a park when the British retreated before the hand-over in 1997. Quite a fair sum of money has been spent in converting the army barracks into a green park. Ponds and waterfalls are incorporated to add in more colour. But due to the topographic feature of the site, i.e. hilly and on a slope, the park lacks the space and environment of a lush green park that one would normally expect from a newly built one.The two key attractions of the park are 1) the Flagstaff House; amd 2) the aviary. The Flagstaff House was the residence of the Commander of HK British Armed Forces. It has now been turned into a museum of Chinese clay teapots. The collection, which is quite reputable, has been donated by the a wealthy local Chinese. Vast amount of time and money had been spent by him in gathering the collection over several decades. Go there if you want to know more about Chinese teas and teapots. There is also a teahouse right next to the museum when you can practice what you have learnt from the museum visit immediately.The aviary is biggest of its kind here in HK. It has more than a thousand brids and animals of different varieties which roam around freely inside. It is spacioulsy laid out, and the setting has been carefully designed and tuned to make it resembles to a stroll along the forest, rather than go pass a line of cages of birds as as in many zoos.You can think about spending about two hours at the HK Park if you are interested in Chinese tea or birds."

It's has a small lake with fish and turtles and fountains that are nicely laid out. The best part is the aviary where you can see beautiful birds flying around and snacking on fruits as well as some exotic birds in cages. The park is huge and can take a while to walk around. The top section of the park is right next to the Peak Tram station so you can visit the park on your way to Victoria's Peak."

Had never been to Hong Kong before so was glad to come but don't feel the need to return again. We stayed at a great hotel in Mongkok called the Langham place which was excellent.Hong Kong itself was pretty ordinary. Really just a big trip to a shopping mall. It had the same shops over and over and over again. If you are from Sydney then it's just like walking through chatswood chase over and over and over again.I'm not a shopper so found it entertaining but not something I'd come back for. In terms of a reputation as a great shopping place I'm really not sure where it comes from. Nothing was particularly cheap certainly nor worth travelling for. We were looking for some cameras and electronics and while pricing it we found we could buy them cheaper online in Australia so quite hilariously ordered her camera from an Australian web site. The only stuff that seemed cheap was small things and cheap trinkets which really I wouldn't bother with. Some brands of sneakers seemed a bit cheaper.Had some good food but nothing that blew my mind.The locals were lovely but the mainlanders new money rude and pushy.All in all a vibrant, busy city ok for a stop over but lacks the culture and sophistication of a Rome, Paris or London I might stay in the airport hotel over night to break a trip but wouldn't bother comming back again otherwise"

Features include Artificial Lake, Conservatory, Aviary, Fountain Plaza (in which you could \"enter\" the fountain and be surrounded by water) and Museum of Tea Ware which was the historical Flagstaff House. Inside the K.S. Lo Gallery there is a nice vegetarian tea house called Lock Cha Tea House. Atmosphere and food there are great. There is also a thai/western restaurant called L16 in the park.

Maybe because its difficult-to-reach location, albeit strategic, and maybe because people would opt for Victoria Peak-Madame Tussaud package than HK Park. You should enter this park via backdoor of a building opposite the street of exit A on Central MTR station (just ask the guards, they relatively have fair English). You may also access this park via other gate, from Admiralty MTR station.You would be surprised about how park is well-maintained; and how wonderful it could relax your mind. And you could enjoy this ambience free! You could also enjoy some parts of this park, like conservatory, aviary park, the lake, and many more... I like the aviary part, since they have very large collection of birds there (but I think, they have to pay attention to people who bring telescope into the aviary street, because they are sometimes annoying other visitors)."

Wedding photographers too seem to use the venue, which is not surprising given that there is a Marriage Registration Office in the park. The park is scenic with a number of facilities that are worth experiencing. My wife and I were traveling with a four year old, so we made a beeline for the children's playground, which was well designed, and comprehensive.

There are lakes, waterfalls, tearoom and lots of places to explore. If like me your not a fan of walking around busy cities with lots of people this park provides a sanctuary from the chaos. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Hong Kong, just picture the ideal city park then visit here and you won't be disappointed."

You can go for 30min or for hours, depending on how much time you have, if you have kids, etc. There is a tea room, nice place for lunch, an aviary + a caged bird area, conservatory, numerous waterfalls, turtles & fish in the pond and lots of places to sit, walk and people watch. While many people will rush around the city to see every sight, I urge you to take 1-2 hours in the morning or afternoon to enjoy this very special place."

My advice is start in the morning at the back of the Shangrila Hotel. You can take escalators up from Admiralty station. Then enjoy a long stroll through wonderful parks all heading West. Dont miss the Tea Museum in that first park. Now you task is to get over Cotton Tree drive to the Botanical and Zoological Gardens. The best way is to head up hill in HK Park and get to Kennedy Road. You will see a public walkway that crosses the busy road right at the end of Kennedy Road. Just keep heading West and you will even find the zoo which has some very interesting monkey breeds including some amusing Orangutans. By now you are right above Central so just stroll down and find Lan Kwai Fong for a bit of eating or drinking fun."

The wet/dry greenhouse is like nothing I've ever seen - desert and tropical environments in the same building! The grounds are beautiful and the waterfall is spectacular.

I found the wild bird population disappointing, only a handful of the more common species were present. However, if I had more time an early morning visit may prove to be more productive. For anyone interested in 'Bird Collections' there is a walk through avery. Not really my cup of tea, I don't like to see captive birds unless done for conservation purposes. A personal view. The park itself is well set out with stunning water features and plenty of shaded seating areas. It appeared very popular with officer workers during the lunch period. Very Good, certainly worth a visit but for the Bird Watcher - Kowloon Park is much better. Be warned anyone with mobility issues may find getting about difficult, lots of stairs. Even just getting into the park may be a challenge. We looked for but couldn't find a disabled persons access point. If it's there it's not obvious."

Hong Kong Park, one of the few easily accessible green spaces in highly urban Kong Kong, provides a welcome respite from the frenetic activity in the rest of the city. The grounds are clean and well maintained and there is lots to see. My favorite thing is the amazing walk-through aviary, featuring an impressive collection of exotic Asian birds, such as the Bali Mynah. And best of all, it's free -- and there's even free wi-fi!"

It's free although you have to climb a lot of stairs to get to the entrance. Lots of tropical birds although sometimes they're hard to spot. The women who take care of the place are very helpful in pointing them out, although their English is limited. Good brochure with photos of the birds. If you're into tea, there's a very good museum about it in the park."

Running over a variety of levels, it also houses the excellent Tea Room, a Tea Museum (ok substitute if you can't get a table in the former), a wonderful walk-through aviary and various ponds, playgrounds and the like. Get there in the morning to watch or join a Tai Chi group. Use it as a verdant relief when whizzing around the city to other places. Well worth an hour or two to wander with a camera."

And it's a gem.It's tucked up behind the Pacific Place complex - a few escalators up.There are waterfalls and lovely ponds full of fish and great little turtles - our kids loved them. The turtles bask on the rocks, usually on top of one another and then waddle back into the pond.It is a very pleasant place to have a stroll - plenty of people do - and it provides a good contrast to the hurly burly of Hong Kong streets.There were tearooms (fully booked!) that looked very inviting and the Teaware Museum which is worth a visit as it contains all sorts of variations on what a teapot can be!The thing we loved most about the park was the amazing location - you are surrounded by tall buildings but it still seems to be a relaxing place to be.Worth a visit."

Not to be confused with the tearoom museum which is a few hundred yards away. Ideally you need to book a tea table in advance (so popular) but we managed to wing it on the day as we didn't know. Soooo traditional - choice of several different Chinese teas (no milk), beautiful porcelain crockery, wonderful setting but the cherry on the cake is the vegetarian dim sum menu. Best I have had in HK! And the toilets are OK too! A very enjoyable Chinese experience right in the middle of HK Park. Take your mum and your friends - just do it!"

Plan to spend hours here because there's so much to see in Hong Kong Park. We toured the aviary first. I loved the elevated boardwalks in the jungle-like setting, with dozens of types of birds to enjoy. I appreciated that so many of the trees were identified with signs providing information about the species. You can actually register to get married in the park, which would make a beautiful setting for a wedding.Climb 105 steps to the top of the look-out tower for breathtaking views of the city. We dallied here almost half an hour and hated to go back down. The conservatory building is divided into two main sections - desert plants and tropical plants. Since I love to take pictures of unique plants and flowers, we spent more than half an hour here and would have been longer, but my companions kept moving me along.The artificial pond is gorgeous, lined with amazing flowers and filled with beautiful koi. An extended family of turtles frolicks in the water or suns on the rocks. There's a small museum on the property dedicated to the history of tea making. Because the park closes at 5:00, we ran out of time and didn't get to visit this exhibit.It's hard to fathon the zero admission fee to this park, or to any exhibit inside the park. It's impeccably maintained. I could have explored much longer, had we arrived earlier."

The Hong Kong Park is really an oasis in the concrete jungle.It used to be part of the British Hong Kong military establishment, and was reverted back to the Hong Kong / China government as part of the 1997 process. It went through the second world war under Japanese rule. A lot of horror stories, and yes, ghost stories still exist there. Other contributors have done a great job describing the place. What I will suggest is how best to use your time there. The Hong Kong Tourism Board offers through KS Lo Gallery free tea appreciation class that situated right in the park. Also the Flagstaff museum of tea ware and a small exhibition of stone stamps / seals carving are there too. If you take the elevator from the Pacific Place building to the Park, there is a great food hall at the lower level of the Pacific Place Building that will give you a good grocery pricing comparison of the higher class people that live in Hong Kong.So combine all these with the visit to the Hong Kong Park, that will best utilize your time. The tea appreciation class is from 4 to 6 and the museums are closed at 6, take the time to visit the park, the museums and the grocery place, that will take about 3 hours, before the tea appreciation class.KS Lo Gallery offers dim sum and tea for lunch, and there is an outdoor restaurant in the Park. You may want to enjoy your good eating there too."

Thankfully, once inside the Park, you feel like you are miles away from the city, its so peaceful, beautiful, green & serene.My favorite place in the park was the waterfalls. The sound & ambiance it creates, takes you to a \"faraway waterfalls in a forest\" kind environment. I did not visit the aviary since I am not a big fan of seeing animals/birds trapped within constricted spaces."

First \u2018attraction\u201d was the fountain where tourists went in under the falling water curtain. We looked at trees and birds donated but not indigenous to HK \u2013 some died, some barely survived (like the jujube tree) and some thrived \u2013 like the cockatoo. Our guide also talked about a croc that its owner had released into the pond, presumably because he had grown too big to be taken care of at home. There was the Olympic memorial built to commemorate HK\u2019s participation in the 2008 Beijing Olympics \u2013 but only for equestrian events. There was the Flagstaff House, the oldest existing Western building in HK built in 1846. It was the office-residence of the British Commander until 1978 then in 1984 converted into the TeaWare Museum. Also the pink Rawlinson House built for the Deputy British Commander now the Marriage Registry. All in all, a nice half hour."

They have various pools and oh!, the best part is they have massive and huge fishes and beautiful tiny turtles. These fountains and waterfalls make up a glamorous scenery or view that is to die for! And don't worry if you are tired there are benches and other facilities available. It is way better than the Victoria Peak and is free of charge. Not only that, but what makes the park better than the Victoria Peak is because of the view. I forgot to mention that they have conservatories, artificial pools and an Olympic stadium. If you do have some spare time then do visit the Hong Kong Park it is definitely worthwhile."

The neat thing is that you are surrounded by huge commercial high rises, namely the Cheung Kong Centre, the Bank of China, the Citi Bank...etc. it is quite different from being in the Central Park in NYC or the Hyde Park in LON. Better yet, you can visit the Aviary. The whole visit may take a good hour, plus transportation or getting to another destination on foot from here, assume 2 hours. i would reserve this visit as secondary, prioritize your visit and leave it till the last day when you know that you have a few hours to kill, and do not wish to rush to another major hot spot. It is a decent place to visit with very few tourists. We visited it in mid morning on our last day, then we just walked to the food court in these commercial buildings for lunch to kill the last morning in HKG in our july visit."

But now there are malls, big stores along the streets, overpass for people, coffee and tea stores, and lots and lots of people. The night market is now the ladies' strip, open even at day time.

This is a walk through aviary with shallow pools and waterfalls. It is not small comprising 3000 square metres and 30 metres high containing about 600 birds.

I spent some time there before taking a Tea Appreciation class at the Lock Cha Tea House located in the park. However, make sure you wear bug spray. I got bitten to death by some tiny flying bugs. I saw them landing on me and just brushed them away (I didn't realize I was getting bitten), but a day later my arms started getting itchy, sore bumps all over them. I had a really hard time trying to sooth the itching, and it took a couple of weeks for the bumps to disappear totally"

Bizzarely the entrance to the park is through a shopping centre (??) as is everything you visit in HK. It did rain hard whilst there but the gardens, waterfalls (or was it rain), lakes, statues, exotic (and named) trees, landscapped areas were beautiful and can imagine when the sun finally came out, it was a wonderful place to walk through. There is a large aviary but the birds were hiding from the rain too. The tall modern buildings that formed a backdrop to the lovely park made for some striking photos."

Located on the mountain-side above Admiralty MTR station and connected to Pacific Place shopping mall, Hong Kong Park is a great place to get away from the city temporarily in the cooler months. This is a good place to visit with kids/families. It's not built with strollers in mind, but stroller-accessible (may require some detours). As it is built on a steep hillside, expect some semi-strenuous walking or stair climbing.The park is decently-sized (although not to the same scale as New York Central Park) and contains a number of things to see: A walk-through aviary, Tea Museum, indoor conservatory and the Peak Tram. I suggest walking through east to west by starting from Admiralty MTR station, taking Exit C1, and crossing the pedestrian overpass to Pacific Place. From there take the escalators up, following the signs to Shangri-la/Hong Kong Park.You can stop by the Tea Museum quickly (there's not a whole lot to see), and stroll along the koi fish ponds while following the signs to the aviary, which I consider the feature of the park.Stop by the bird enclosures above the aviary and then head inside. The aviary lets you get up-close with the birds and you can see them swooping through the enclosure and munching on snacks placed by the caretakers (please don't feed the birds yourself!). It's a one-way trip, so take your time. Then you can either head back to Pacific Place, see the Conservatory (usually contains some cactus exhibits) or head to the Peak Tram"

This is just a wonderful place for people watching amongst very well maintained gardens with ponds, where if you are lucky you may even spot a kingfisher.Taking the path up the steep hill you will arrive at the huge walk-through aviary and admire the many birds free flying above and below you.There is also a restaurant at the lower entrance to the park for a good range of refreshments and you are within minutes of the escalator down to Pacific Place if you must have that Starbucks coffee!"

Make time to see the aviary - for photographers there are amazing opportunities for unique shots. The observatory tower has 105 steps up a circular staircase - 3 or 4 rapid ascents are a great conditioning set for the cross-fit aficionados. No so energetic, then sit by the lake to watch the people and enjoy the tranquility. The Tea Museum and the Conservatory offer more local colour. No charge for the experience, Hong Kong park offers balance to the pace of the city - cross Cotton tree Road and you are in the heart of the financial district. It is a 5 minute walk from the north end of the Zoological Garden. Enjoy."

There are water features which block out the sounds of traffic, etc. Lots of benches to sit on, paths to wander along. There is also a moving monument to the health care workers who died during the SARS epidemic. A foot massage walk (bring thin socks so you can really enjoy it). And a Museum of Tea. Next door to the Museum is a Gallery and Tea House. The Tea House was very peaceful. The menu for the tea was about 6 pages. I chose a tea I had learned about in the Tea Museum. A young woman came and prepared the tea at my table. Between the walk around the park and my time at the tea house, I left the park refreshed and ready to tackle the hordes again."

Nestled among high rise banks, hotels and shopping centers Hong Kong Park provides visitors with lush foliage, gorgeous flowers and bushes and beautifully designed water features and cascades even a large waterfall. Also included without any admission fees are a super conservatory and a very impressive and large aviary. Here serenity rules. A must visit.Bottom line: You can get there on Bus 103 from Kowloon Station or Bus 12 from the Central ferry dock. Also useful is Bus 15C from the Central ferry dock but it terminates at the Peak Tram stop after which you\u2019ll follow signs and walk a little. But the best way is to use the escalators in Pacific Place (Exit C at Admiralty) and follow signs all the way to the top. Riding all the way."

There is a great fountain that you can walk in and stand behind the water. There is also a man-made waterfall that you can walk up behind and get a great overview of the park. The ponds are wonderful--stocked with koi and the best turtles I've seen. I find the butterflies to be astounding. They are large, some as black as midnight, others as colorful as a rainbow, and they will sit and let you photograph them. The plants and trees are labeled for your edification.My favorite places in the park are the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware and the LockCha Tea House next door. If you love tea, the gift shop at the museum has wonderful teas as well as great tea ware. The LockCha Tea House is reminiscent of the tea houses of the early 1910's and 1920's. The waitress will come and make tea in the traditional way at your table. The restaurant is vegetarian and serves great dim sum. They also have tea tastings at the restaurant. The marriage bureau is also in the Park, and every time I've been there beautiful brides and their handsome husbands are with their bridal parties taking pictures amid the wonderful grounds. Definitely a place to bring your camera."

My five year old son loves it - and what a great way to spend a day with family!This is a much more compact Disney Land and understandably so. Even then we still did quite a bit of walking, so I actually quite like the fact that it's small. I've been to the Paris one before and remember only that we had to walk miles from one attraction to the other. There are certainly things you could do to cut short some quequing time. Buy the tickets online is one of them. Otherwise you have to waste some 30 minutes to get in the park, which is a long time for little kids. They also have \"fast pass\" that you should try to utlise. I suggest doing a bit of homework before you go - find out which rides you would like to do, and arrange your day around them. Fireworks at 9pm is apparently really great, but for the super jet lagged people like us it was a bit too late. Save something for next time I guess! Next time we will also consider getting a 2 day pass just to take things at a more relaxing pace.This is certainly a park that is more tailored around little kids (4-7). And of course the older ones will still have a great time - go on Space Mountain and you will understand!Overall a very worthwhile spot to visit, especially if you have kids! We will be back next time!"

Plenty of places to sit, the Aviary is definitely worth a visit, the waterfalls and sitting by the ponds watching the terrapins and fish etc. One thing they loved was a waterfall where you could sit inside - great way to cool down. Toilets were very clean and there were water fountains for fresh drinking water to replenish your bottles. A little oasis - we tied this is with the Peak in the morning and then spent about two hours wandering through the park, getting a drink, ice-cream - a really beautiful place. When you walk through you then hit on Pacific Place so you can merge it into a full days intinerary. Highly recommended not just from me (sentimental reasons) but by two teenagers aswell!"

When visiting Hong Kong, it doesn't take long for the overwhelming crowds, traffic, noise and heat to have one searching for some a patch of green space just to relax and get away form the chaos of the city. This is where the very good Hong Kong Park serves both visitors and locals so very well. Near The Peak Terminus, you can find Hong Kong Park, which has many small (free) attractions and is well worth spending an hour or two at some point during your visit to the city. In addition to typical city park fountains and artificial lakes w/ fish and turtles, there is a very good aviary with several hundred tropical region birds flying around freely, many will perch on the walking deck just in front of you. The deck itself is well above ground level, creating a very nice experience, whether you like birds or not. There is also a conservatory building dedicated to plants, with two particularly interesting rooms. First, a dry room with cactus plants and then a humid room, with tropical flora. There is a tai chi garden area, a few statue and monuments and a very nice Tea Ware museum, found within the historic Flagstaff House, which is the longest standing western building in Hong Kong, built in the 1840s. These attractions are quite close together, thus you can visit them all in just an hour or so. Or you might want to just grab a park bench by one of the small ponds and enjoy being away from the maddening crowds and traffic to be found in the nearby streets of HK Island. Overall, we are big fans of Hong Kong Park, considering it our favorite in all of Hong Kong and we recommend spending a bit of time here when visiting the city if you need to get away from the crowds. Also, consider visiting the nearby Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens, not far from Hong Kong Park, offering a more wooded area, instead of city park, along with some animals on display. Combined these two attractions are a good way to spend time if you are visiting as families with young ones."

There are turtles and fish in the ponds and a waterfall that you can walk behind, as well as an Olympic auditorium - worth a visit to relax and get away from the city. I exited via the nearby shopping mall that leads down to Admiralty MTR."

The walk through aviary, however, was huge and the birds had a lot of space to fly around. They had nearly extinct birds such as the Bali Myna, and they seemed to be in good condition. The tea place inside the park is really worth a visit, the staff were helpful and really knew their stuff. A great day out."

Now I'm working here and I think Hong Kong park is like a good escape from the tall buildings of Central Hong Kong.I went there when sun was about the set and we went up the vantage point and I think it was just astonishing. The combination of the city and the park was nice. I'm from another big city myself, and these kind of landscape scene is not quite familiar. There are also many other areas worth seeing within Hong Kong park. So I would like to recommend any visitors to at least have to troll through the park when you have a chance. Maybe after the trip or before the trip up the peak! :)But I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do."

What a difference in culture.I will only review Hong Kong and Lantau Island in this review. Hong Kong is a very clean unpolluted place. 99% of the vehicles run on LPG no petrol or diesel fumes. Considering how densley populated Hong Kong is it was very refreshing to breathe unpolluted air and walk down, frequently washed streets. Even the seawater in Hong Kong was a clear aquamarine with fish clearly seen.It is a wonderful place. Easy to navigate on foot, train or bus. If ever you are stuck, apart from English almost being a first language and all signs in English, at least 5 Hong Kong Chinese leapt to our help without being prompted or being invasive. We had such a laugh with them when we were going on the right bus but wrong direction.The Star Ferry going to Hong Kong Island was brilliant. About 15 to 20 minutes to get across the harbour. Go at night see the brilliantly lit skyline. I have never been to New York but I thought it could look like Hong Kong. Wonderful laser show every night at 9pm at the water's edge on the harbour.Food was Cantonese with many, many western restaurants thrown in. (KFC, McDonalds, Steak houses, Cordon Bleu) 5* restaurants ranging to the humble street Chinese noodle restaurant. All immaculately clean and the service first class in all cases. Entertainment in most of these restaurants down on the harbour front. Going back to the Chinese, Cantonese fare, it would what you get in the UK. All restaurants were reasonably priced according the standard of the restaurant.The shopping in the electrical shops were about the same as the UK so, I did not pick a cheap Ipad..........shame. Lots of Asprey and Garrard type jewellers in the main shopping area of Napier St (I hope I have got the right name).Free WiFi everywhere even on the buses! Could not get over that!We only touched on Hong Kong and could have seen so much more.Lantau Island is now where the airport is situated. No longer skimming the roof topson the mainland, so we missed that experience.We also visited the huge Bhudda on Lantau Island. We did not take the organised tour but made the journey ourselves by bus and train. Very easy to do and cost us about \u00a310 for two including getting a drink. The tour can cost up to \u00a345 each but you do get a meal. I would highly recommend a visit to anyone."

The gardens are beautiful and provide welcome tranquility in what can be a noisy city. The Museum of Tea Ware is a sterling institution that showcases tea culture, tea history and the best entries in the annual teapot-making competition held in Hong Kong. The aviary further up the hill is also a good zoological asset for Hong Kong worth a visit."

The conservatory on the ground floor was full of the perfume of spring flowers. Steps led up to a amazing cactus collection and then down to a tropical plant display. Out side the park was a delight of floral displays, ponds brimming with fish and turtles, as well as fountains and waterfalls. This park was once the site of a British Army Baracks and only a genius could have conceived this transformation. Do not miss!"

We had just returned from the Peak and were going to find a taxi to get us back to our Hotel - it had been a long day in very warm weather, but decided to walk some of the way. Let's face it no where is very far from somewhere else in Hong Kong. We were ambling along and came across the gates to the park, all looked at each other then said lets go in for a bit of a look (not realising exactly what this place was). We were all so pleased that we did it was the most beautiful place and to know that these gardens were in amongst so many massive buildings is unbelievable. There was a wedding party in their having photos taken and so many people sitting and taking in the serenity or just wandering around - but it was not crowded. Lots of lakes and little rivers - the chinese love water and fish as we all know. A beautiful waterfall where you could go in behind. Then the bird aviary which was just wonderful. We probably spent a couple of hours there and could have stayed longer except that it was getting late, we had been on the go all day (and just returned from the peak) and had a 14 month old toddler with us (luckily she slept in her rucksack when she got too tired). We were a little confused as to exactly where we were and left by one gate, which actually took us to the bottom of the road on which our hotel was situated but the opposite end. As it turned out had we gone out the gate just on the opposite side, but which was up the hill we would have left the park very near to our hotel. Never mind it was great just walking around and seeing things you wouldn't if you had taken a taxi or a bus.A visit to Hong Kong Park is a definate necessity should you visit this wonderful city."

Situated near Admiralty station, it's easy to get to and is a picturesque break from busy, urban HK life. There are some beautiful old colonial buildings and some great landscaped gardens and water features to see. If you explore the place fully there is a nice aviary and also a large viewing tower with awesome views of the park."

In the midst of the business towers and shops of busy Central District, the Hong Kong government has created a beautiful, modern and relaxing 8 hectares park, free for the use of its citizens.One way to access the park is through Pacific Place Mall. There is an escalator which takes you up. Once there, you can wander around and enjoy the facilities as well as the natural landscape, waterfalls and ponds.The park was built on the site of a former garrison, and some of the historic buildings, built between 1842 and 1910, have been preserved. Notably, the former residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces, known as Flagstaff House, is now the interesting Flagstaff House Museum of Teaware, and the Cassels Block is now the Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre. In the centre of the park is a waterfall and lake. There are also two very modern facilities, the Conservatory and the Aviary, built on the hillside near the Tai Chi Garden and the Vantage Point. Other facilities include the Sports Centre housing a variety of sports activities, the Squash Centre housing 12 air-conditioned courts with a restaurant, a large carpetted children's playground on many levels, a Central Garden surrounded by grand columns and a dancing fountain in the middle, the Olympic Square - a mini Greek theatre which hosts various entertainment events, the Vantage Point tower, which affords a panoramic view of the park and the surrounding scenery, the Tai Chi garden - a long collonade with gardens, courtyards and bonzai trees. There is a restaurant if you need refreshments or a meal.This beautiful park, with its many facilities, is worth a visit as a respite from the crowds of Central. You will enjoy its many restful corners among the fantastic skyscrapers surrounding the park, and the gracefully designed landscaping and facilities."

This is no Hyde Park or Central Park nor will you find anything of that nature in Hong Kong due to a lack of space. However, considering the constraints faced in this mega-city, Hong Kong Park along with the Zoological and Botanical Gardens nearby make up a perfect escape from the chaos and madness that is Hong Kong on most streets. Hong Kong park features a couple of small watersheds with fish and turtles as well as a large man made waterfall area, with benches and bridges. This, in effort to help you forget that you are just a few dozen meters from serious foot and road traffic, it effectively does the trick of pulling you into nature, in the middle of the city. The highlight of the Hong Kong Park is a very good outdoor Aviary, allowing visitors to walk a long platform that is 30 meters above the ground. Here you will see and get up and personal with exotic birds flying above, below and in front of you. Its a great place to practice your photography skills and just enjoy being in a natural environment, along with lovely birds. Hong Kong Park is accessible from Admiralty and Central MTR stations and are not far from the Peak Tram and attractions, just follow the little signs and you'll be there in no time. Ideally, this park is visited along with the Zoological and Botanical Garden nearby where many animal species are on display."

Most locals are even unaware that this place exists or haven't been there since they were children. Don't let their descriptions keep you from visiting this beautiful place! They have small gardens interspersed within a park. The zoo mostly consists of a large aviary section and a large primate section. They have small monkeys - smaller than your hand and monkeys like orangatangs, gibbons, and lemurs. It is difffently a beautiful stroll through the middle of the city. My friends and I enjoyed our day trip to see this park. If you do a search for Hong Kong zoo, you will find the offical site, complete with a list of animals at the zoo and pictures. Beautiful place!"

            "review": "Nice little green space in the city. Hong Kong park offers a nice escape from the bustling streets of Central/admiralty. The park includes well kept pathways, a small man-made pond and waterfall, and a bird aviary. It was relaxing to walk through the trees and hear so many bird calls that I had never heard before. Hong Kong Park is much smaller than Victoria Park to the east, but it is a very short walk from the waterfront area around Central."
