We stayed in Lane Cove & travelled on the train every day into Sydney sightseeing. We did the bridge climb on a previous visit & everything we learned about the bridge that day has kept us in awe of the grand vision as well as the architectural & construction excellence of a past era. It was an engineering feat way before its time. It sees us still having a strong, well constructed icon as valuable to Sydney today as it has been in years gone by."

There are many ways to experience it. For example, you can watch it from the distance, you can cruise below it, you can use it to cross the harbour with your car. But one of the most satisfying ways is just taking a stroll by foot using the pedestrian lane. It's rather long, and we started from the Rocks and did just a section of it."

There is security along the bridge for your safety. The bridge is free to cross. There is a tower you can climb to take photos and get a 360 view but there is a charge. We didn't bother as we could see all that we wanted to from the walking path itself.The walk over took us around 20-30 minutes but we stopped to admire the opera house views, watch ferries and take photos. Once over the bridge it's only a short walk to the opera house itself. A must if your in Sydney!"

Take a ferry from Circular Quay and you pass under or next to it. The bridge offers great views of the harbour and especially the Opera House. We have now had the unique experience of walking under and climbing on two bridges that the famous English Engineer Sir Ralph Freeman (responsible for the design of several of the world's most impressive bridges) was involved in designing. The Victoria Falls Railway Bridge, which he worked on as a young engineer and the Sydney Harbour Bridge which he designed."

            "review": "Walk, don't climb, for sterling views and an up-close encounter with one of Sydney's best pieces of engineering. It's hard to confess you love a piece of engineering without sounding like a giant nerd, but I genuinely love this bridge. When I moved to Sydney in my twenties I lived on the north side of it and worked on the south, and the delight of riding over the cycle path every day was a large part of falling in love with the city. In many ways it's an unassuming structure: steel, stone, concrete, tarmac \u2026 but its position over one of the world's genuinely great natural harbours and the poetic rhythms of the arched span elevate it to something more. Twice now I have been lucky enough to walk over it on days when it is closed to traffic, and the cathedral-like space under the central arches is as close to a church as I have ever felt on a piece of transport infrastructure.Sure, you can fork out a wad of cash to do the climb. But for exactly no cost, you are free to walk across it any time of day (or night). Make sure you take the east-side path as the west is a dedicated bike path and people will shout at you (rightly so, it's a narrow path and tends to be ridden at speed, so it's like wandering down a freeway). I recommend walking from the north to the south, partly because the views are better, but also because it means you finish your journey at the much better transport hub.Ideally, you should catch a train to Milsons Point Station (about $4) or a ferry to Milsons Point wharf (more expensive). There are any number of things you can do while there, from walk around the harbour edges to visit Luna Park or the peek at the PM's official Sydney abode in Kirribilli (though you get better views from the Manly ferry), but let's focus on the bridge walk. The staircases onto the bridge are well signposted. They mean that it is, alas, not suitable for the mobility impaired (though the train will give you a really good view, and both Wynyard and Milson's Point stations have wheelchair access), but neither is a difficult climb (I've done it when not-long out of plaster for a shattered foot). The stairs put you onto a pedestrian-only path that has a very gentle rise and fall across the bridge's span, before stairs again at the other end that will take you down near The Rocks and Circular Quay tourism areas.Fast walkers will reach the other side in about fifteen minutes, slow walkers may take closer to thirty. And if you stop for photos along the way, it can take longer again.Wire mesh has been erected across the walk to deter jumpers, which can get in the way of selfies, but there is a gap at chest level, so the dedicated can get shots of themselves with the Opera House in the background. Views include the harbour itself, with Fort Denison clearly visible and glimpses of Clark and Shark islands past the Garden Island dockyards, with the full stretch of Vaucluse's mega mansions in the distance. There is a good view of the Royal Botanic Gardens sweeping out to the east of the Opera House, and an excellent view of the Opera House itself, as well as the major part of the city. If you turn around, or walk from the south, the parklands and heritage housing of Kirribilli provide equally attractive views to the north.For people who want more of a tourist experience, the South Pylon contains a small museum and lookout, open during business hours, seven days. The $13 entry fee is vastly more affordable than BridgeClimb, and the displays are more focused on the bridge's role at the heart of Sydney than the flashier interpretations at BridgeClimb. At the time it was commissioned, during the Great Depression, the Sydney Habour Bridge was one of the major sources of employment in the city. A short film and a series of well-chosen and interpreted photos and artefacts -- including some of Harold Cazneaux's amazing photos, he shot most days while the Bridge was under construction, following its path from pylons through to the building and meeting of the arch, then the creation of the span beneath it -- give you a wonderful sense of how important it was in and of itself, not just as a way of joining the two parts of the city.The lookout is surprisingly impressive, with commanding views that make great souvenirs of the day for visitors to the city (I say, having had to pose in about 15 with friends and families who have flown over. But you do get a great shot of the Opera House and harbour from up there.)On a hot and windy day, it can be a very sweaty and oppressive walk, as the steel, concrete and tarmac all combine to increase the heat. But you can cool off at Milson's Point or Dawes Point, depending on where you end up, so this is not necessarily a deal-breaker. It is hard to stay dry on a wet and windy day, but you do have astonishing views of the boats battling their way across the choppy waters, and won't be bothered by large groups. In terms of free things to do in Sydney, this is one of the easiest and most enjoyable.Trivia to end. At the opening ceremony, the ribbon to declare the bridge open was prematurely cut by a right-wing nutter slashing a sabre from his horse. The photo of the incident that graced the pages of the Sydney Morning Herald the following day was taken by Harold Cazneaux's teenaged daughter Joan, who told me years later that she had been immediately pounced upon by the Herald's official photographer, demanding to know whether or not she had got the shot, and then shouting to let her father know that he was whisking her back to the Herald's dark rooms to develop it when she said she thought she had. She went on to become Joan Smith, Dick Smith's mum, and was one of the nicest and most interesting people I have met in my years in Sydney."

Many people were taking the time to walk the upper structure too. A great way to see the skylines of both shores and more of the inner and outer harbour areas."

We were a bit unsure how she would take to it but she loved it.The tour guide was brilliant with all the people in the group. There were 14 people from 9 years old up to 70 year old and the tour guide remembered everyone's name and the pace of the climb suited everyone.We did the climb at 10am and were finished in the gift shop by 1.30pm. We purchased 10 photos on a memory stick as well as getting our caps and a couple of gifts in the shop.Brilliant highlight of our holiday.One tip is it goes by height for children and not age so our 7 year old could have gone up."

            "review": "Brilliant Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb. On 24 September 2016 my husband and I took part in the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb. Our session started at 9:45am. As we didn\u2019t want to risk our walk by getting lost and arriving late we did call by the day before so we knew exactly where to go. The facilities at the start were very good. A coffee shop, a souvenir shop and toilets too which were clean and in good condition.On the morning I was quite nervous. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to go. I wasn\u2019t sure if I would be scared or if the walk might be a bit difficult for me \u2013 At 50 I\u2019m not the fittest person, not a lot of time for exercise in our busy lifestyle! There were 12 people in our group. First we were ushered into a preparation area. It was rather warm on the walk to the climb and my husband and I had already questioned our chosen clothing thinking we might be hot, but we worried about being cold on the bridge. But we were provided overalls and it was suggested we only wear underwear under the overalls and that was perfect for us throughout the walk. In the preparation area there were plenty of change rooms and we were provided with a locker to place our belongings and valuables. We carried the key to the locker around our necks clipped to our overalls. Except for glasses and any necessary medication we were not allowed to take anything else \u2013 no cameras, phones, video cameras etc. We were offered all sorts of items which could be clipped to our overalls. These included caps, neck holders for our glasses, handkerchiefs, jackets and raincoats. We were also offered sunscreen. We were not allowed to carry water bottles but there were three drink fountains along the bridge. Apparently special arrangements can be made for special occasions like engagement rings for potential proposals! After we were all prepared we moved to the practise area where we practised clipping ourselves to the ladders and moving up and down the ladders. There was plenty of time and we were not rushed at all. Once we were all comfortable we moved outside to the bridge.For me, the initial climb up the ladders was the hardest part and to be honest it was not that difficult at all. I think it was hard because I was scared. There were approx. three ladders but they were very sturdy, couldn't move and had good handrails and we were clipped onto the ladders. After these ladders we were at the beginning of the arch but on the inside of the bridge. It was a very easy climb from here on in. Up the arch to the highest part of the bridge, okay a few times my calves did feel a little tight (!), across the bridge and down the other side. There was absolutely no rush at all, we were given lots of opportunities to stop for about ten minutes at a time where we could look at the stunning view. We often needed to stop for the guide to take photos, or if we caught up with the previous group we would stop and wait for them to get ahead. Initially we walked on metal grill and you could see through that to whatever was underneath but that was only for the first part of the bridge. Then timber planks were inserted into the grill so you couldn\u2019t always see what was underneath.There was never a moment where I felt so scared I couldn\u2019t continue on. Initially I was a little uncomfortable but as soon as I could see the view I forgot any fear. Strangely I never felt like I was up high or that I might fall as I thought I might have done. We were never that close to the edge where you could look over. You could only look out to the stunning view.Altogether our climb took about three hours. The first hour though was spent in the preparation area.I would recommend the climb to everyone. It was not nearly as difficult as I had anticipated nor as scary. Give it a go! Don't put it off any longer. Even though you might initially be scared, you'll overcome your fears quickly and love the experience!Our guide Darren (Daz) was fantastic. Very patient and full of enthusiasm he made sure we were all comfortable with everything and took great care of us throughout the walk. Thanks Daz!"

            "review": "Sydney Harbour Bridge walk. On a good sunny day, it is very relaxing to walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, a unique Sydney icon. Construction of the bridge started on 28 Jul 1923 from both sides of the harbour. Alignment for joining in the middle were carried out by a numbers of cable. Marvellous works from the Australian engineers. It was open on 19 Mar 1932. Total length of 1,149M with width of 49M. It has 8 road lanes, 2 rails tracks, 1 cycleway and I pedestrian walkway. There are two entrance/exit to the bridge. From the Southern side, it is along Cumberland St in The Rocks. From the Northern side, it is along Broughton St. in Milsons Point. If come by train, get off at Milsons Point metro station. If come by car, best option is to come to Milsons Point and get the 2 hours free parking along Broughton St.While walking across the bridge, there is nice view of the Sydney Harbour.Day time & night time views of the Sydney Harbour are absolutely beautiful.Each year during Engineering Week in Aug run by Engineer Australia, there is a guided tour by volunteers. If you are interested in the history, construction and engineering aspect of the bridge, you may like to join this guided tour."

The views are spectacular and the commentary is really good, interesting history and facts and figures.

In our case we enjoyed both attractions equally, but the bridge allow you spectacular views of the harbour from a different perspective. You can walk it for free or, if you are seeking for some thrills, you can climb it. Don't miss this great and iconic attraction!"

Accessing the start of the bridge is a good workout with luggage in tow, however the views of the harbour are spectacular as one walks across. If you are staying in the City, it's easy to get a train ticket at Milsons Point station and return to the City by train...another fantastic experience for Sydney visitors, or walk back again."

It is safe, secure and scintillating; there was a wobbly moment or two for me, climbing the verticle stepladder to reach the bridge (more scary than the climb) and get down again and walking across a mesh walkway at the top of the bridge (I had a moment's flutter) but seriously folks - this is a must. When you are actually climbing the arc of the bridge nothing phases you....the views, the interesting chatter on the headphones, the stops for photographic opportunity (they take photos, you are only allowed your sunglasses and a hairband on the bridge - no phones or cameras) and the realisation, that this wonderful structure built in the Australian depression was constructed in desperate times by people with no safety harnesses, clothing or hats - is completely mind blowing. I will not dwell anymore on the history - your guide will tell all - it is fascinating. It was raining on the day we went, not too much and it did not spoil the experience in any way. At the top, you are given time to enjoy and breathe in the captivating sites; you can also ask questions and learn that there are many, many sharks in the bay beneath you !! Safety for each and every person on the bridge is paramount and I have never felt more looked after or so sure that nothing was going to happen to me this day. I would do it again in an instant - sunrise or sunset I imagine must be magnificent but it is the sort of adventure to have at any time and feel the same amount of excitement. Go on, push the boundaries - do this spectacular climb - it is Fair Dinkum"

They have security patrolling the bridge at night so you can feel safe and secure... apart from the movement of the bridge as the traffic makes its way across .. There are a few stairs to negotiate so you do require some degree of fitness lol.. I recommend walking to the middle, taking a few pics, then walking back.. if you want to go all the way across, I'd catch a ferry. or at the least one back."

Of that 3 hours, most of the time is spent in a \"training room\" learning how to hook and unhook carabiners and waiting around for the next stage. Compare that to spending AUD250 on an exhilarating sky diving trip, where much more logistics is involved in terms of per tandem instructor, helicopter rides, coach transfers and a personalized video ??? Just for comparison, a trip to the tallest tower in the WORLD, with tip top experiences thrown in, cost just USD130 per person for the peak hours. I have done all 3, hence I can compare the experiences and conclude that the harbor bridge climb is just too over rated."

If you have the opportunity to climb this bridge, do not pass it up."

This was brought about by spinal injuries and the inability to carry heavy photography gear. We recently changed our focus and started to embrace Sydney and its early years with Heritage locations in the Rocks. I always loved Circular Quay and the bridge was in the background, people crossed it, climbed it and went under it but it wasn't in my thoughts. We have been developing Sydney photography walking tours under Australian Photography Tours and the Gwondana banner. In doing so as I ventured through the back streets and alleys of Sydney I noticed that the bridge nearly always appeared at the end of a street. We walked round the pillars and included it in our general tours without really focusing on it. That all changed with one photograph. Now I travel to Kirribilli, along the north ans south harbour foreshores. We catch the little Sydney ferries and travel to different areas of the harbour. Everywhere we go there is something new. Ten days ago I was at Kirribilli having breakfast after photographing the bridge from a totally new angle. Now besides the Rocks and CBD we are in the process of creating photography tours on water using the bridge as the hub. As for refreshments, there are so many places to go, it's a smorgasbord. Experience a tour on the harbour as you check out our bridge. Call me anytime."

I live in NSW but would like to urge all travellers to Sydney to make the Bridge a part of their itinerary.Of course many visitors sign up for the bridge climb, and this is a great way to enjoy the Bridge, and the city and harbour views. TripAdvisor reviewers who have done the climb seem to give it a high approval rating.Another way to enjoy the Bridge is to walk across it to Kirribilli on the north side of the harbour. There are some nice restaurants over there. It is also possible to continue your walk to Anderson Park and Lavender Bay. Also on the north side of the harbour you will find the North Sydney Olympic Pool and Luna Park.Great views are available from the top of the south eastern pylon of the Bridge.If you can not manage these then it is possible to travel over the Bridge by train. Another option is to pass under it by taking a west bound ferry to Darling Harbour or Parramatta.However, it would be a shame to travel to Sydney and not get up close to this iconic and central structure."

We took the opportunity to climb the bridge on a very sunny and picturesque day and it was one of the best experiences of my life.

I don't like heights much but thought I should challenge myself and also thought so many people do this it can't be that bad! It is extremely efficient and well run .If you think you are going to smuggle anything up there think again! I was disappointed I had to take off my Nike fuel band, I wanted all those extra steps ! They essentially body search you after you take your clothes off and put on the jump suit with a metal detector. No go pros of cameras could be smuggled through. Glasses have to be secured with special straps that are attached to your outfit, you are given a special handkerchief that is secured to your wrist. Clearly they want nothing to fall onto an unsuspecting foot passenger or car below you. It is impressive you well thought out it all is. You are very safely clipped in the whole time.My issue is how very expensive the whole process is . They say it took almost 10 years to set up and get the approvals which I believe but they are making a lot of money now . It was a lit if fun, we had a gorgeous day for it too. I felt I really got to see Sydney as well, but at nearly $300 per person it was pricey! If you don't have an issue with spending that much go for it!We did the express climb which is quicker than the full climb but the same price . It did not feel too quick lots of time on the bridge and to be honest the pace was fairly slow. No one on our group ( of many ages and sizes) seemed to be struggling with anything .Our leader was calm, young and experienced , she was patient with the photographs she took and did a good job."

It's a really fun day out. The security instructions and outfit is top top. You get to do a little trial climb up and down a ladder before, you are breath tasted, everything is attached, caps, glasses, clothing and also you to the bridge by a wire. We were introduced to our group so everyone warmed up and we chatted all the way up and down. Our guide was outstanding with his knowledge and jokes ( even if he was from NZ!:). It's not a hard climb. If you can climb up and down a ladder ( as you have to to get up on the bridge to start with and at the end) and are not afraid of heights and can walk for 2 hours you can do it. We had a retired older couple in our group who were absolutely fine. Because you climb the bridge with your own legs it becomes a memory for life, a small achievement for a normal person and the view is just beautiful."

Did you know the four beautiful pylons, two on each end of the bridge, don't hold the bridge up - they in fact hold the bridge down, stopping the ends of the archway from lifting up. It's Ridiculously Expensive to do a bridge climb to get onto if the arches, if you do it though you won't be disappointed you did, though you'll be able to climb easier for all the money you just spent leaving your pocket and no longer weighing you down. Though sometimes they do some good prices on the redballoon Australia website. The bridge can be driven on, cycled on, walked on, train ride on. If you're going to drive across it, be careful it's five or six lanes in one direction with three or four in the opposite direction, the direction of the lanes changes with the led signage depending on peak demands and it's very confusing where to take your off ramp beyond the bridge as there's just cars everywhere. There is a vehicle toll fee to head into the city, prices of the toll change throughout the day depending on peak times. Tolls in Sydney are done through an electronic tagging system that is attached to the inside of your windscreen."

Only in Australia could you be allowed to climb onto bridges like this one! Really cool. Only downside is the cost. For our little group of three it became pretty pricey and when my teenage daughter said that she wasn't into the idea I somewhat gladly dropped the idea. You can find online what the cost is."

You're clipped in start to finish using rock climbing tools. I had the thought at one point that I could actually TRY to jump off the top and I'd be unsuccessful because I was so securely tethered. This is an iconic bridge and the climb is its signature event. Try it unless you're clinically agoraphobic. If nothing else, it's worth it for the picture you get of yourself with the Opera House in the background!"

From here the views down the harbour and over the Opera House are stunning and un-encumbered by the sound of trains which run the western side of the bridge. Other than the 20 or so steps either end, up from Milson's Point station and down into the Rocks, the walk is level and easy, taking just 15-20 minutes, depending on the number of stops you make to enjoy the amazing views. In taking the bridge pathway, joggers, couples and families with kids can enjoy some of Sydney's best views and experiences absolutely free. Highly recommended."

The Sydney Bridge Climb is very popular but also very expensive ($300/person) and also not necessarily appropriate for everyone, e.g. People scared of heights, the infirm, etc. A great alternative for a similar view at a much lower price ($13/person) is the viewing platform inside the south-east pylon of the bridge. This is the large stone tower, closest to the Sydney Harbour. Enter it by walking across the bridge on the side closest to the Opera House. The entrance is clearly marked, and the climb is pretty reasonable (200 stairs). En route to the to the top, there is great information on how the bridge was built. At the top, enjoy 360-degree views of the city!"

Much, much faster than the old coin method.And of course, by Train... Which can take to Kirribilli, North Sydney, Cremorne, and points north.OH, AND MOST EXCITING, THE SYDNEY BRIDGE CLIMB!

We were still jet lagged though and found Sydney tiring for that reason. Getting out of the city is s must but as everyone says about the bridge we felt we had to do it. Sadly though the Aussies didn't like the English. This ruined the trip but as I say the jet lag didn't help either. Seeing the bridge is probably enough unless you have an urge to walk it :-)"

Every climber receives full gear including headphones to hear the guide.

Before bridge walk they give you proper training & proper safe cloths too. The view of Sydney is really good from top. When you reach on top you really fill that you are in Australia & national flags of Australia help you to fill so. Bridge is more than 80 years old but still stand strong. One important thigh is that when you are on top someone will take your picture from near opera house with very good camera & good lance worth to buy it. There is also walk way on bridge via road. Its covered walk way for pedestrian safety & bridge history mention in every few distance. There are good & friendly security person standing in few distance. From there also you can have good view of circular quay & opera house. Should visit this bridge day & night time."

It is the world's largest (but not the longest) steel arch bridge with the top of the bridge standing 134 metres above the harbour.

Firstly you dont need to pay to go on the bridge, you can simply do the Cahill walk which runs parallel to the road on the eatern side of the bridge and will take you all the way to the other side. N.B The western side of the bridge is for bicycles. Access: If you're coming from the harbour, walk up Argyll street heading west, going through The Rocks. Head past Lowenbrau restaurant, and you should see a bridge/tunnel just ahead. Keep heading up the road, and just before you reach the bridge/tunnel, there will be a set of steps on the right which will take you up a level onto Cumberland street. Directly infront of you, you'll see the stairs which will take you up to Cahills walk - N.B the arrow is pointing the wrong way to Cahills walk, when you go up the stairs and see a path going along the bridge, take it. Dont go up another flight. The bridge walk is approximately 90m above the water, and the views from above are brilliant. You can see for miles, have a great view of the harbour, and the Sydney Opera house. This is a definite must when visiting the city."

If travelling by bike there is a dedicated path running across the bridge on the western side. If you are walking there is a dedicated path on the eastern side of bridge. start walking or bike riding and stop along the path to take in the views of harbour and bridge design. Imagine when this bridge was first open, how grand it must have been - massive pylons, a single span across the harbour, ships are able to pass directly underneath and the bridge is still impressive. For those who like to conquer things you can pay to climb the bridge but for my money I think you get a good expereince by walking or cycling. When you get to the other side which is Milsons Point you can grab a bite to eat and do the trip in reverse or catch the train beck to Circular Quay from Milsons Point station."

Best ever thing to do when you have a few hours to kill is to walk across the Sydney harbour Bridge and watch the sunrise.The early morning air & the beauty of the sunrise is truly worth it.Add to that the view of the harbour in general & you get some good exercise to boot.A great and inexpensive way to spend a few hours with friends and family - take your time and enjoy it. Check when the sun is due to rise the day before you go and plan to get to the middle of the bridge in plenty of time so you are relaxed and can enjoy the sights.Get the camera out and take some lovely pics.Enjoy"

I absolutely loved the bridge, some people have said to me \"but it's just a bridge\" since arriving back in the UK, but it's easy to see why so many people flock to see it. It's a fantastic feature of the city and can be seen from so many different places, giving great views from all around the city. It's also great as an experience (bridge climb) and a focal point when arranging to meet people.I watched the new years eve fireworks display from the east quay, and was blown away by the whole thing (pardon the pun). It was truly spectacular, and a great way to start a holiday. The only negative I found was that waiting for the display was a long long day. I got to the quay early to secure a decent spot, and in the sun, it was pretty brutal. It was well worth it, but you have to be willing to hold your ground towards fireworks time. We had so many people trying to push in when we had been waiting there all day. No way was I giving that spot up.... Well worth the battle :-).As mentioned above, it's also possible to climb to the top of the bridge and take in some of the scenery which is just incredible. My wife is terrified of heights but was honestly fine all the way up. You can't see through to the water or road underneath you and are pretty securely strapped onto the bridge. The safety is unreal too, everybody is breathalysed and you have to have a zero reading to be able to climb, so no chance of drunk people ruining the experience for you. Our guide was brilliant, very funny and helped to put nervous people at ease, we even still follow her exploits on Instagram which is pretty cool. You can definitely enjoy the bridge for free, but I would honestly recommend doing the bridge climb at least once. There were people of all ages, shapes and sizes climbing in our group, and none had any issues. Give it a go, you won't regret it. The one downside I would say is that they make you pay for all of your individual photos. You basically only get a group shot for free and lets be honest, nobody actually wants random strangers in their photo. This means you have to pay extra for the shot you actually want."

Admittedly there were sections that you go vertical up some ladders but the rest is a walk.

My previous visits to Sydney were short and I have never bothered to find out if people could walk on the Bridge although I have crossed over it many times by train, bus, or driving a car. On this visit learned it from Susan Hong (a friend of my sister) who was the one invited me to walk together. We met at Milsons Point station where we started our walk. Within few minutes we already reached the signs of Cahill Walk seeing flights of stairs going up. Susan has a bit OA and knee problem so our pace was slow. It took a little effort to take the stairs up but we managed onto the flat footpath of the Bridge. [Note: our direction was towards the city so the walkway for the pedestrians is on left side of the Bridge, right side for the bikes.]What an awesome view it was when we were on half way of the walkway and that moment I felt like shouting out to the whole world that I was standing on the world famous iconic landmark that is one of the most attractions to the tourists from different parts of the world. It is a breathtaking view for the city, the harbor, and the opera house. On the Bridge I did not have to be like in the ferry crowds trying so hard to find a place catching a good shot of the photo. There I could take my time and took nice pictures as many as I wanted. Just be careful with your smart phone or iPad while stretching your arms peering through the frame (the gap) of the metal fence, definitely not good for pro camera.

Mitch was a superb tour guide and can't thank him enough for making this such a great experience. My wife is not athletic and has battled chemo within the past few months, but was still able to make the walk with relative ease. There are a few sets of steps that are straight up and down, but most of the steps are much easier and on a long slow slant. The sights are amazing, the bridge history and climb history are very interesting and there are plenty of stops to relax, rest and view the area. This is not to be considered a thrill seekers option, but my daughter and I both enjoy more thrilling things, yet found this to be a fantastic must do while in Sydney!"

The Pylon Lookout is at the southern eastern end of the Bridge (the Rocks end) and visitors can go and see very informative exhibition about the Bridge and also see the spectacular 360 view from the top of the pylon. Amazing views of Sydney Harbour with Opera House, the Sydney Central Business District and bridge itself! We would recommend visiting the Pylon Lookout on the Sydney Harbour Bridge."

Before you consider in doing \u2018Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb\u2019 in Australia, you must read \u2018Things You Need to Know\u2019 and \u2018Health & Safety Essentials: Can You Climb?\u2019 on their website. There you will find the safety requirements you must meet before you purchase any tickets. What was not mentioned on their website is to wear comfortable clothes that is easy to take off because you will only be wearing your undergarments (underwear and bra) underneath the \u2018bridge suit\u2019 given to you to wear. Also, if you have long hair, to have it tied back. It it\u2019s loose, your \u2018Climb Leader\u2019 will provide elastic bands for you to tie it back anyway. Of course, commonsense tells you that it is a climb, so wear comfortable, enclosed shoes. And for safety reasons, you cannot carry anything with you on the Bridge. They will provide secure lockers for you to keep your personal items locked away safely. If you need to wear glasses, your Climb Leader will hand out straps that securely holds your glasses on to avoid any mishaps. Now comes the hardest part, which part of the day to climb that magnificent Bridge and the speed of walk?I highly recommend the \u2018Night Climb\u2019 because Sydney is at it\u2019s best at night glittering with lights. And what better way to view Sydney from a height of 134 metres above sea level \u2013 most memorable and enjoyable scenic view you could possibly experience! I have also chosen BridgeClimb not BridgeClimb Express\u2026 what\u2019s the hurry? I am so glad that we have chosen \u2018night\u2019. On our particular night climb, it was a fresh evening but while climbing, it sure heated us up in no time at all and the fresh breeze was rewarding yet comfortable. Each group is assigned to a \u2018Climb Leader\u2019 who will take great care of you. Your Climb Leader will give you a demonstration of how to climb up and down the ladder, like a mini virtual climb and then each person will take a turn \u2013 making sure you have understood the instructions before starting the \u2018real\u2019 climb. Not only will you be in awe while doing the climb but you also get a brief history of the bridge from the beginning of its construction till present. Our Climb Leader took photos of us during our climb \u2013 group photo, individuals or your own little group of friends / family. You can even say a message or sing a little jingle to send to your beloved ones or special friend, we weren\u2019t prepared for this, so hard to come up with something interesting to say on the spot, so we declined. So be prepared if you want to do something like this. At the end of the walk, each person received Group Photograph, Certificate of Achievement, a BridgeClimb Cap and free entry to the Pylon Lookout \u2013 all included in the price of your ticket. However, the individual photos of yourself or your own little group photos and video will cost extra. And yes, souvenirs are available to buy.Most importantly, remember to check in at the front desk with your Reservation ID 15 minutes prior to your departure time. We arrived a lot earlier, so we could view the exhibition and cinema to learn more about the history and celebration of the Sydney Harbour Bridge before our climb."

            "review": "Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb Was An Amazing Experience!. I did the Express Climb (about 2hrs all up) with work colleagues as a team reward. Our guide Max was fantastic, keeping us informed with factoids about the Bridge's construction and amused with jokes about New Zealand & our \"parachutes\" (actually fleecy jackets in a special pack attached to our suits). As a middle-aged woman with high blood pressure & questionable fitness, I managed the speed & few rest stops OK, although Max was kind enough to stop for me to catch my breath & cool down after a particularly steep & longer section of the climb!Larger people may find some of the tight spaces a challenge to manoevre through especially with the fleecy jacket pack strapped to your backside, and there are only water stops at the very beginning & end of the climb so try to be well hydrated before you start. There are also no toilet stops of course, so get that balance of enough fluid Vs need to pee right! Although the day was cool (apparently about 10.5c at the top) & breezy I did not feel cold at all, & in fact would probably have left off my lightweight long-sleeved top if I had known how warm I would get. The suit provided was lightweight & didn't provide much warmth but we were all supplied a polar fleece jacket in an attached pack (our \"parachutes\") if needed. I wore a t-shirt, cropped leggings & light long-sleeved top underneath the suit and we all received a souvenir cap to wear, but I needed to pull the suit pants up, roll up the sleeves & remove my cap to help the breeze cool me down.One of my work colleagues was afraid of heights so asked to be next to our guide, and she had no problems during the climb. You are nowhere near as exposed to the edge of the bridge as it looks from a distance & in photos, and are securely attached to a guide cable the entire time. The view at the top is just incredible, and later when you are down on the ground and watching other people walking along the top you get such a sense of achievement.Simply a MUST-DO ACTIVITY!"

The \"coathanger\" as it is affectionately known by the locals, is a symbol not only of Sydney itself, but also of Australia as a whole. It was a huge project that was conceived by some great minds and built during the Great Depression. It opened in March 1932. The bridge is all steel and requires constant painting. As soon as painting is finished on one end, it starts all over again at the other end. The total area of painting is equal to sixty sports fields! Apparently it contains at least six million rivets! As well as this its hinges are big enough to absorb the expansion caused by the extreme heat of Sydney summer. On either side of the Bridge there are two huge pylons; their presence is not really structural, they are there more for aesthetic reasons, and they make the Bridge unique. On the opening day, 19th March, 1932, the New South Wales Premier, Jack Lang was meant to cut the ceremonial ribbon, but was upstaged by a disgruntled army officer, Francis de Groot, a member of a right wing organisation, who cut the ribbon riding on his horse! The ribbon was quickly re arranged and the Premier did eventually do the honours. Horses with a rider paid much less to cross the bridge than cars, in the early days, but now a return trip costs over two dollars. The Sydney Harbour Bridge is the world's largest and has many imitators around the globe, but none like it. Millions of people use every year. On special occasions it may close to traffic, as it happened once, during the 50th anniversary in 1982. During that occasion pedestrians were allowed to walk on the bridge, which remained car-free for the occasion. The next time this will happen will be in 2032, so start planning."

We chose the express climb for time - it goes up the inner arch with views of the Opera House, stairs to top by the flags, then down the other inner arch. 2.5 hours. The full climb goes on the upper arches, but takes longer. The views were amazing. Our guide was great - several photo/rest stops and he gave us lots of information about the bridge construction & history as well as the city. They provide you with everything you need & the prep areas are so streamlined. Most of the climb is on shallow stairs, some ramps, a few of steeper stairs, some climbing over things & ducking so you don't hit your head - be prepared for an active couple of hours. You can see to the bridge/water the entire time. You cable on in the tower and aren't off the cable until you are back in the tower - I never felt unsafe or insecure. No cameras/phones allowed, so prepare to buy their photos. Worth the cost - checked one off bucket list! Try to avoid weather that is too hot, too windy, too cloudy! Includes a pass to the top of the tower at the end of the bridge."

This climb has been made famous by celebrities and has helped solidify the notoriety of the bridge itself.Before you commit to a climb, note that you can walk across the bridge for free. The path is wide and comfortable enough that even those with fear of heights should be fine. High fencing is on both sides of the path.The climb is a different issue. The bridge itself does not seem all that high, yet once you factor in the cost to climb, it seems a lot higher. They offer climbs in the day, at twilight, and at dark. Climbs (guide included) start around $250 per person and increase depending on when you climb. (The cost goes up for twilight and evening climbs.)

Good views of harbor & opera house from the bridge. 5 of us paid ($13 adults $6.50 kids AUD) to go into the pylon & climb up another (200 steps) to bridge museum & lookout from top of pylon. I'm into facts & history so I enjoyed the museum & the views were fantastic. Almost as good as on the bridge climb (which we had done on a previous trip, well worth the $) but unlike the bridge climb we could use our own cameras. Everyone in our group who did the pylon was glad they did it and the shots from the top were some of the highlights of our trip to Australia. If u visit Sydney, this is well worth the view."

The bridge was built in the same style as the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne (at the time the world's longest single span bridge) which was officially opened in 1928 by King George V. Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened three years later in 1932. Both bridges were built using steel from Dorman Long in Middlesbrough, England."

No doubt what with the harbour beneath , the Opera House and the botanical gardens the views must be pretty good but looking from the ground up it was just another bridge. And yeah, there's the history behind it and the work that went into the construction but there is a fair few number of bridges out there which deserve more praise. On the plus side the view of it at night all lit up was pretty good . But still...only three stars."

I highly recommend this activity splurge (the Bridge Climb website lists all current pricing and available bookings). The guides are very professional and safety oriented. You do go through a safety orientation as well as breathalyser test. Wear durable and comfortable shoes for this activity. They do provide secure lockers for your personal items as you cannot take them with you. Plan on 3-4 hours for the entire experience.

Our guide (Dave) looked after us really well, pointing out key features of the bridge, landmarks and keeping us entertained with vignettes from the bridge's construction and opening and wider Sydney. It was a great experience too be up so high and be buffeted by the wind; great exposure! I'm really pleased it was on my bucket list.My only criticism would be not including individual photos of climbers within the price of the climb. A$275 is a lot of money and given the captive audience can't take cameras on the climb, I think individual photos should be part of the package. You do however, receive a group photo together with a completion certificate and branded baseball cap."

Walks up the harbor bridge are arranged too. Lots of things to do around the area."

To bypass it is a few more kilometres but takes a lot more time. The tunnel is the same fare. A few times since I've lived here they have closed the bridge to traffic, once on its 50th anniversary in 1982 and again for \"Sorry Day\" in 2007. I walked the bridge both ways both times. There may have been other special occasions I don't know about.The bridge was designed with 6 lanes which in 1932 was unheard of. Afterward they added the \"Nippon clip-on\" which made it 8 lanes. Most people overseas see the bridge with the New Year's fireworks when it has special lighting but in fact even on an everyday crossing it seems pretty special to me as it reinforces the idea we are a city on the water and you can see the Opera House, the tall buildings in downtown Sydney plus all the boats in the harbour."

The only time I almost felt a little bit anxious was when you had to climb up the four flights of narrow ladder steps to get to the top. Those steps are very short and narrow and you have to pay attention or your foot will slip off on them. You're tethered to the bridge by a hook and cable so you don't have to worry about \"falling.\" You can even be in a group that walks it at night. I'm sure that's a wonderful view at night, but I know I couldn't do it in the dark! :-) Worth the experience, though!!"

It was a moment of serenity standing on top of the bridge, a memory I will never forget. Climbing it was a great way to learn about the history, as our guide was very well informed, and the immense structure of the bridge and the engineering feats of it are much better appreciated up close. This isn't for the faint hearted however, walking above the highway with cars zooming past does take a bit of getting used to, and whilst not looking down usually is a good idea, not looking down whilst standing on top of the bridge would be a mistake.I loved climbing it and I would do it again if I had to opportunity, whilst it is expensive, it is great with family or close friends to share to wonderful occasion with. It definitely should be on your bucket lists and crossed off them!!"

It is well worth crossing the bridge on foot from one side or the other, it only takes 30 mins at most, and you get fantastic views of the Harbour, the Opera House, and the feel of the steel bridge up close. You can also climb one of the towers to get the elevated view of the city and all the surrounds, for only about 10 dollars. Many do the Bridge climb, but in my opinion, it is too expensive and takes too long, also, you have to book and if the weather is not very good, you cannot change the booking, except in the case of electric storms, and you cannot take any photos for security reasons. I recommend the walk across."

Lovely walk and view just from the pedestrian walkway. I discovered the tower climb ( not to be confused with the much hyped bridge climb which I just wasn't drawn to, experience or price wise). I thought I'd get a great view from up there and I'm impartial to a bit of stair climbing. It was a fantastic view and well worth climbing the 202 steps. Just don't think it was worth $13 ( or just under 16c per step) to see a few models and information displays and a souvenir store. But a terrific view and from about the same height as the top of the arch via the bridge climb if you aren't a thrill seeker."

Spoiler alert: this review gives a lot of detail about the walk because I was looking for detail when I was trying to decide if my fear of heights was going to ruin this experience for me. So don't read if you don't want the blow by blow! :)I'm not terrified of heights but I have a healthy fear of falling to my death from some place very high and going splat. So I was apprehensive about paying hundreds of dollars to crap out of myself. But I am so glad I did because the views were AMAZING and I actually felt like I conquered my fear a bit. We chose the upper bridge walk (lower bridge walk is the other option but they told me it's much narrower). We suited up in the jumpsuits they provide (so your clothing won't catch on anything), did some practice ladder-climbing with the cable they hook onto your suit, and then were on our way. Turned out I was the only one in our group who was afraid of heights (really?? doesn't everyone else try to torture themselves to overcome fear??) so the guide had me go right behind him, at the front of the pack, which helped me feel more comfortable. You start by walking along the lower part of the bridge, and then climb a series of ladders to get to the upper deck. You then walk along the upper deck to the midway point, pose for a bunch of photos, check out the amazing views, and come back the way you came.The beginning of the walk was really unnerving because you walk along grates and can see through to the ground (very far) below. Keeping my focus straight ahead got me through, but I did not enjoy this part at all and was starting to wonder how the hell I was going to make it through the next 2 hours without having a meltdown. The ladders were a little hairy since they are narrow and you can only go one at a time (which had me questioning their structural integrity). But they didn't bother me as much as the first part since you can just focus on going one rung at a time till you reach the top. The upper deck- which I was the most worried about because I thought looking down at traffic and being on top of the bridge would make me freak out- was actually the easiest part. The walking path is pretty wide and is solid steel, so you can't see through to the traffic below as you're walking. Somewhere between taking in the amazing views and starting to believe that I wasn't going to tumble to my death, I started to really enjoy myself. I actually got so comfortable that I started looking down on purpose and liking it!! (Even walking over the grates on the way back didn't bother me.) All in all this was a great experience and I highly recommend it!"

The views are stunning and it is pretty amazing to be looking down on huge cruise ships. The ladder sections were the only challenging sections, as they are very steep and very narrow. The rest of the bridge climb is an elevated walk. :)"

The centre-piece is the spectacular harbour which is traversed by the iconic Sydney harbour Bridge. You can walk around or climb the pylons of the bridge and at either end you have glorious harbour view parklands. You can climb the bridge for a unique and unparalleled 360o view . You can walk, cruise or drive under the bridge. You can even wet a fishing line in the harbour beneath it. Our bridge provides the centerpiece for many events such as Vivid, Australia Day and of course New Years Eve. No matter which way you choose to see the bridge ...just do it!"

On the day of the walk, we asked a runner where the elusive bridge walk entrance was since we kept walking by what we thought was it. As it turned out, It was tricky, indeed, for lack of proper signage and we did walk by it several times! Once on our way, our frustrations quickly dissipated as we were treated to the view of the busy iconic Sydney Harbour along with the Sydney Opera House. Sharing our walk were runners, bicyclists, power walkers, tourists, and walking commuters (in their suit and briefcase) leaving Sydney\u2019s central business district to the North Shore! This is a must do while in Sydney."

There were a lot of runners on the bridge, and quite a few tourists as well.Be sure to stop and talk to the security guard about 1/2 way over the bridge.

You simply only need to walk across it to feel its strength. If you are not afraid of heights you can climb it, like hundreds do every day of the year. you can take a boat ride beneath it or even just walk under each end. It is a major point of Sydney's New Years Eve Fireworks. Some nights after work in summer, I walk home across it and I feel exhilarated from the height and the size of it. You can even view the harbour from a viewing platform on the south eastern pylon. A visit to Sydney is not complete until you have walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge."

It has a large gift shop which is good. First you check in and they tell you what time to meet upstairs. When it's time you sign your disclaimer and get breathalysed. We the all had to introduce ourselves and it turned out that it was mostly Scottish and Americans (plus us Welsh) in our group of 14. The we were given our suits to put on. The lady told us that because of the heat we may want to just wear our underwear underneath. I broke the ice by telling the group that I was not wearing any (it's always good to break the ice when so many of them looked so nervous!) Then we got kitted out with our safety harnesses, with radios, hankies, caps, glasses cords which all clipped on to it. They then get you to have a little practice on a specially made apparatus just to make sure you are okay with it. Then it's straight out onto the bridge. Our guide was called, \"BRANDO\" and he was awesome. Really knowledgeable and friendly and a great help to those in the group who were nervous. My wife was scared about doing it and had been worrying about it. Brando put her at ease and put her at the front of the group which really helped. The first part is a walk under the bridge which is raised but you are perfectly safe as you are in your harness and it is secured to the rail. You walk for about 50 metres and then go up about 5 flights of steps/ladders and then you are on the structure itself. There are some water fountains along the way and a water spray for your face in a couple of places. The views are spectacular and the stories from Brando were interesting and amusing. My favourite was the one about the guy who cut the ribbon before the official did it on the opening day. He was annoyed because the Royal Family had not been invited! At the end you can get photos on a USB and you get a certificate. Don't panic if you are scared of heights. Once you are on the actual span itself it is quite wide and you will feel safe. Your guide will help you and everybody will be patient. Do not miss out on this experience as it is well worth it."

The arch itself, spanning the Harbour, is over 1,600' in length, with its high point being 440' above the water. The Bridge carries cars, bicycles, and pedestrians from the Sydney Central Business District to the North Shore.There are two ways you can get above the main deck of the Bridge. The most famous one, is the Bridge Climb, where for somewhere between $200 - $300 U.S. you get a guided climb to the top of the arch. One thing to be aware of, is that you may not bring any photographic device (camera, smartphone, etc.) with you during the climb. This is for safety purposes to make sure you are concentrating on the climb, and not on taking pictures. The second way to get above the Bridge deck, is the lesser known observation deck at the top of the first pylon on the Bridge. It's a little difficult to find the path to the pylon, but well worth the effort. The observation deck is 285' above the water, and provides 360 views of Sydney. The cost is around $10 U.S. Definitely a great way to see the city and harbor."

Having said that, $300 per person (non-refundadable, be careful!) is an exorbitant amount of money to pay. For that kind of money, I would expect a nice tee shirt and a few pics to be able to throw on the mantle at home. Instead you will get a throw-away baseball hat and one pic filled with a bunch of strangers that you climbed the bridge with.

Better than any tour I have ever experienced. Set up in assembly line fashion, visitors are run through an in depth process that includes pre-tour briefings, medical paperwork review, breathalyzer for each participant and more. Uniforms are issued for each guest including hats and a fleece in case the weather gets too cold. These people are all about SAFETY, SAFETY and SAFETY. From the time you walk outside, you are connected to a ingeniously designed safety cable system. As you walk your safety harness flows with the safety cable. There is no way you can get hurt or fall off. Each guest dons some impressive safety gear and everyone walks through a simulator that includes the ladders and railings before departure. Everything is attached to your suit \u2013 they even give you safety straps for your glasses which are also attached to your suit. Everyone wears a headset to hear the tour guide throughout. Our guide Daniel was both a wonderful story teller and a calming voice, especially for a couple of people on the tour who weren't so sure about things as we started out. He smartly monitored folks along the way, especially in the beginning and made sure they were take care of. What was most surprising was how wide the pathway was for the climb. Railings are everywhere and you are constantly connected to the safety cable. You can't bring along a camera, GoPro, watch or anything that could potentially come loose \u2013 they even walk you through a metal detector just to make sure you don't have anything that might fall off onto the highway 300\u2019 below. They do take photos for you and the best deal is a USB stick of all your photos - $60 and well worth it. At the end of the tour they give you a custom printed bridge climb certificate along with a group photo. Bottom line is this: the Bridge Climb is a must do for any visit to Sydney. Next time I'm doing the night tour."

The walk one-way was about two miles from the access point to the exit. It was a little difficult finding the access point from the Sydney side and then you had to climb three flights of stairs. I only mention the stairs for those who have trouble with them. The exit also has stairs, but far fewer. The rest is fairly flat. The exit is at a train station which makes it convenient for those who only wish to walk one-way. If you look carefully, there are small wood benches built into the fencing every so often that allow one to rest if needed. That fencing makes it so children would not be able to run into traffic making this a good activity for families. The walkway is ample enough to easily walk 6 abreast so passing others or dealing with oncoming pedestrians is not an issue. If you can navigate the stairs at each end, baby strollers/prams are doable. Please note that there are no bathroom facilities at the Sydney-side entry point; the only one is in the train station on the other side.The fantastic part of the walk is what is in-between the entry and exit point. We had a spectacular view of the harbour, the Opera House, the ferries, the cruise ships and distant shores. Looking down we had a bird's eye view of all sorts of activities. We took our time and savored the view, the sunshine and the breezes. It was a highlight of our trip."

The harbour bridge can be viewed from many places and many angles. Among the best views would be from the Opera House and from the deck of a ferry cruising in the harbour. I've enjoyed viewing the bridge in the mornings, afternoons, evenings and at night. Personally, the sunset and night views of the bridge while cruising on a ferry are the best. This is a must visit landmark when in Sydney. A beautiful piece of architecture and a very recognizable landmark."

For me it was the most memorable thing we did in Oz. The travel agent we booked with failed to give us the time of our climb and when we arrived we had actually missed it, this was not a problem though as the staff were really helpful and promptly fit us in to a climb 45 mins later. Every member of the crew are amazing. The climb takes roughly 3 hours give or take. You fill in a quick form and get breathalysed and then it's off to suit up. As it was hot we were advised to put the jumpsuit on over underwear only. Everything you wear is attached to the jumpsuit you are wearing and you aren't allowed to take any photography equipment up with you, they take professional photos of you while you are up there anyway. You can wear your sunglasses however you must attach them to a lanyard around your neck. You get a pair of headphones so you can hear your group leader during the climb and get to practise climbing some ladders before you set off. The group leader was full of knowledge and gave us information about the history of the bridge and surrounding areas as we climbed. Although some parts are steep you stop regularly to catch your breath (if you are a bit unfit like me!) and admire the view. Reaching the summit was just breathtaking! I would strongly recommend the climb, it was just brilliant and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again."

So if you are at the back of the queue you will have a long wait! I guess there's some obscure reason why even two people can't be on the ladders but that's the way it is - enjoy!Great friendly guides, lots of water stops on the way up and even if you're not super fit, you will still manage it OK, up and back in about three hours!At the top?

We had to show up a bit early, around 3:30, the 3 plus hour experience. The location where you meet your guide has lockers for your gear (no watches, wallets, pants allowed). Yep, I said pants. You get a jumper that you'll wear while on the climb and the guides were very direct when they said no pants--just your undergarments and shirt are allowed under your jumper. So, be prepared-- LOLThe climb itself is aweome. Be prepared as the guide will ask for a volunteer to go first. I did and got more time with him than the others...I could ask questions when he wasn't talking to the group making for an enjoyable experience. Their are 3 areas where my fear of heights was tested. Initially, when you walk out you are on a very narrow walkway, with metal grate underneath your feet. You can look through it and see down 100 feet or so. Scary view. The same effect occurs when you've reached the peak of the bridge and cross over the road. You'll be 134 meters in the air, looking straight down at cars, and thinking about how thin the metal is under your feet. Final challenging part is ascending and descending the 4 ladders that are required to summit the bridge. They are straight up and down and really a bit awkward to climb as the rungs of the ladders are very close together. The view is worth everything you go through though! Twilight climbs are the best as you get to see the city, opera house, surroundings during the day as you climb. As the sun sets, you are at the peak and get to see the same sites all lit up. Breathtaking...this has to be the best time to climb!!I would do this again...it really is amazing and one for the bucket list"

Tourists from all over the world come to Sydney to view it from every angle. Tis probably, together with our Opera House, our most photographed icon, whether on it, under it or over it. Can say I have climbed it (Bridge Climb), have now also walked it from end to end as a senior. What a special time that was, enriched by the pylon experience of walking up inside to visit the harbour Bridge museum and archive. To learn that there were men who had died in the building of it, to read the statistics, history, gave me new respect for this marvellous human feat, still relevant, convenient, used to its utmost even today. Can recommend, encourage anyone, any age, any ability, disability, to walk across at least once. The views amazing."

The climb is very expensive and you need stamina to do it. We were observing the bridge from the opera house one day and it started raining and got very windy, and there was a tour of 10-12 people at the summit of the arch. I am sure it was not pleasant so if you do the climb make sure you are up for it and the weather is good. I believe the cost is about $160, and higher for longer and higher climbs. The better way, in my estimation, and free is to walk over the bridge. Although there are stairs to initially get on the bridge, it is a flat straight walk across. Since you must eventually get back I suggest you take the metro to Milsons Point stop, which is on the other side of the harbor, and walk the bridge back to The Rocks. The sights are spectacular. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did."

The climb itself is not as physically taxing as you would expect. There are some ladder sections which can be tricky (especially as the train line runs alongside you!) but the main part of the climb is a gradual incline, giving you plenty of opportunities to appreciate the view, and the climb you've completed. The view is spectacular. You can see over to Bondi and even the blue mountains on a clear day.We had a great guide who told us about the history of the bridge during the climb, and answered all the questions we had on the way.The price includes a group photo, but we paid in advance for a USB of pictures, this seemed to be the best value. Our guide made sure he took plenty of pictures of us during the climb so that we had plenty to choose from when we returned.Would definitely recommend this!!"

Don't worry if you're scared of heights as you don't really have that feeling of being so high up as you don't look over the edge. The only time is at the very peak when you cross from one side to the other and walk across the walkway above the traffic lanes on the Bridge and that can be a little scary but just look up if you're nervous!"

The walk provides a great view of the harbor, the Opera House the neighborhood on each side and he various ships and boats sailing through."

So figure four groups are on the bridge at a time with about 15 per group. You are not allowed your own cameras, so the tour guide must take each picture. So essentially the 3 1/2 hours is standing around while 360 individual and 24 group shots are taken. Repeat, there is only on view of the opera house. The guides are also well trained bridge climbers. They are not photographers. I would still do this event, but be ready for a grind. I think this compny lost their way.

If you don't mind walking, please go for it. You can spot very beautiful views of Sydney atop of the bridge (ahoy, photographers!). As it was raining, I didn't do the return trip by walking. Instead, I took the train from Milsons Point Station back to the other side. Do not worry if you're alone, I encountered 2 guards along the way and they were extremely helpful."

By the time we suited up and went through the safety checks it was starting to get dark. We watched the sunset at the very top of the bridge. As we descended the lights of Sydney became brighter and twinkled. It was dark as we climbed down the last set of stairs and we turned on our head lamps. The views are spectacular. This is a pricey activity but a must when you visit Sydney. It's a once in a lifetime experience....or maybe I'll do it again on my next visit to Sydney."

The stairs at either end can be steep if you aren't fit but well worth the climb. At the city end you can continue on to the Cahill Express Way which is another must do, and then continue to the Botanic Gardens. When walking the bridge stop at the pylon and climb to the top it's doesn't cost an arm and a leg but well worth the view.

While the Opera House is beautiful, wonderful inside and out and a 'must see' for any visitor to Sydney, the Bridge towers over everything and is visible almost wherever you are in the city.Unless you are completely unhappy with heights I recommend the Bridge Climb as an experience you will never forget. It is so well organised and everything you could possibly need is provided for you and securely connected to you.The climb is made in groups of up to sixteen with a guide leading who communicates to you via a headset, The guide passes on lots of interesting information and anecdotes about the bridge and its builders, and there are several pauses to take photos, one of which is given to you at the end of the day together with a certificate. The others you can buy if you wish. The climb starts with a full briefing and equipment fitting and a practice climb up a \"simulator\", as cimbing up and obviously down some ladders is required. My partner and I both managed this easily at the ages of 79 and 82 respectively, but a small amount of agility is necessary. After this the climb proper begins and for the entire time you are connected to a safety wire so no worries there.The view from the bridge is spectacular and unforgettable. I recommend taking the \"twilight climb\" as you climb up in daylight with the wonderful daylight views and when at the top the lights come on in the city with the beautiful panorama that that presents. The climb was the highlight of our visit to Sydney (no pun intended). If you can do it, do do it."

Once we got to the summit by the flags, I just wanted to yell ' yes, I've climbed the Sydney harbour bridge', to say I'm proud of myself is a real understatement, I must add that I did this with my 17 year old Grandaughter who took it in her stride!!

The guides enlighten you with history about Sydney and the bridge and provide a few good laughs to make your experience even more enjoyable. It is a costly experience but well worth it!

Before I went my question was would I be too nervous to enjoy the experience. The answer is: not in the least bit nervous.You could not get hurt on this climb if you tried. OK, maybe a twisted ankle. You are basically locked into a jump-suit. The jump-suit is clamped to a cable and not unclamped till the walk is finished (amazingly clever engineering). A guide walks you through the climb, stopping frequently to talk (and give you a chance to rest). We did the longer climb and I don't think anyone in our group of varying ages was ever out of breath, even us \"active adults\". Additional employees of the climb are posted anywhere where there was the least chance of any difficulty maneuvering around the cable, although they really were not needed.We went at a time that we would be up at sunset, great time to go.All in all a great experience, wouldn't have missed it.

It really is as good as you think it is going to be.The whole trip takes over three hours. The first hour is taken with being kitted up. You have to wear a special shell suit with no pockets - if you dropped something you could kill someone.Attention to detail by the organisers is of an exceptionally high order. You have a guide to take you up, point out the interesting features and answer questions. The guide also takes pictures.You are locked on to a guiderail and cannot fall off. In terms of scariness In terms of need for physical fitness I would rate it as 3/10. As long as you have a head for heights the scariness factor is 2/10.The 'wow' factor is 10/10. The climb is grossly overpriced and the photos even moreso. Nevertheless, it is a wonderful and unique experience which I would recommend wholeheartedly."

You can access the bridge from The Rocks area and walk across at your own pace, albeit without the dizzying heights of the summit of the bridge. You still get great views and it's good exercise. On the other side of the bridge you can visit Luna Park or just walk around enjoying the foreshore of the harbour and the beautiful bays. A must visit is Wendy Whiteley's secret garden at Lavender Bay, accessed by walking past Luna Park and continuing until you get to Lavender Bay. There is an underpass on your right hand side going under an old rail siding and some steps which lead you right up to the garden. This is a magical place where all the work has been done by Wendy and her faithful band of helpers. The garden is a credit to them. A ferry ride back to either Darling Harbour or Circular Quay will complete your journey."

The Sydney Harbour Bridge, also affectionately known as the 'Coathanger', was opened on March 19th, 1932 You can have a close hand look while you are in Sydney by visiting the South Eastern Pylon. It is a walking trip and recommended for the fit only. It is a longish walk to get to the base of the Pylon and then there are 200 steps to the top. There is a charge, it was $13 the last time I went. The views and photo opportunities are fantastic. (If you can make it, I've got to say it is tough). This bridge was the first thing displaced people after the end of WWII saw, so many people still think of this as their symbol of liberty.Great place for families, but make sure everyone is ready for a stiff hike."

A casual walk across takes approx. 20 minutes, presents great views of the iconic sights such as the Sydney Opera House, Luna Park and the harbour in general. I do the occasional lunchtime walk across and back in about 40 minutes leaving me some time to grab some lunch before heading back to work. If you're wanting to see more, you can go up the pylons or pay to do the bridge climb which I did some years ago.

The bridge is everything I expected and more. The south pylon climb was an inexpensive way to get up to the top of the tower for even more specatacular views - and had the added bonus of providing a great history into the bridges construction. I had no idea that they could build the bridge in two sections and then drop them against each other with a pin fitting into a slot on the other side to connect them. What a feat of engineering for it's time. Tip: the access to the south pylon tower climb is on the sidewalk on the bridge itself, and not from the bottom near the water."

We could see the people walking over the bridge which I'm sure is awesome but our adventure was equally as exciting and cost nothing. The bridge is also a busy working road and rail service and is frequented by runners and cyclists. But the fact remains it is a work of architectural brilliance and most Def one of the world's most famous landmarks."

We noticed security \"guards\" ever watchful if anyone had plans to leap and such, but there were not so many that this was not a problem for them or for us. It was reassuring however that there were people there who cared.

Pretty special really to be able to do it. It was on my friends bucket list, so she can tick that off now! Although, I think you can walk across the pathway on the side? I walked around and under it.

Sering toe harbour beneath you through the stairs is the hardest part, the wind can be a little daunting but the organisers will stop any climb if danger is imminent. So go ahead put it on your bucket list. You are strapped to steel all the way up, and back.Make sure you celebrate after descent. You can get photos if you are on your own so dont Despair photos are available.Who knows a preposal on the Sydney Harbour Bridge may be planned.

The briefing was very professional and the guide was very enthusiastic and informative. The view from the top is something I will always remember."

Walked from north side to south as suggested by tourist office. Took train from Harbor Side one stop. Walk down to the water and see bridge and opera house from a different perspective. Totally different view. Can't help to see if you fly in or take a cruise. Iconic Sydney."

There are very few global man made structure if any that match the beauty of the Harbour Bridge overlooking the Sydney harbour especially on a clear Sydney day. It is short than some of the other great bridges such as the Golden Gate and the Bay but just as amazing if not more. A walk across the bridge on a clear day (winter or summer) overlooking the Sydney opera house, some of the largest cruise ship in the world and a sea of small and meduim yahs and sail boats is a must for every Sydney visitor"

The 2 1/2 hour time frame was long enough. We waited for a sunny clear day so we could enjoy the views. The temp in March is great and our guide was super friendly and funny. Negative : The price.

Very organized and thorough when explaining the process, they even have you practice before going out on the bridge. You have a total of an hour prep so by the time you go you feel pretty confident. The climb itself is like nothing else I have ever done and it is made better by your tour guide who lets you take your time, talks you through the process and there are lots of stops along the way to enjoy the amazing views of the Harbour. This is a must do on your your trip and splurge for the pics you won't regret it."

Doing the bridge climb is an amazing, exhilerating experience but if you're just not quite ready for that, try walking across the pedestrian track instead (it's free). I do this walk regularly by myself or with several or all of my 6 daughters. The walk is a comfortable, level 20 minutes (approx), but there's no need to rush. The view is spectacular, day or night. The only hazard is ocassionally bumping into other walkers because you are too busy checking out said view. At either end of the walking track,interesting areas await you. Kirribilli (North end) is a lovely villagey place with heaps of great places to eat,grab a coffee or wander the local streets checking out heritage terrace houses, plus there's an easy stroll down to the harbour where you can look directly accross to Circular Quay and the Opera House. At the other end of the bridge you walk directly down into the historic Rocks district. There is also much to see and do in this fabulous area, but thats another review! I highly recommend this attraction for locals and tourists."

You can walk across it, drive across it, catch a train across it or ride a boat underneath... The most popular night for viewing the bridge is on New Years Eve when the city hosts a popular fireworks event across the Sydney Harbour. Many people stake their viewing spot 4 days in advance by camping in that spot! Popular viewing spots away from the Bridge are The Opera House, Millers Point, Blues Point Reserve, Lady Macquarie's Chair and Toronga Zoo. You can walk underneath the bridge when walking through the historic Rocks area which has many historic pubs to wet your whistle, and if you go at night you might consider booking to see the Sydney Observatory nearby and definitely pop into the MCA to see their latest art exhibits. You can walk underneath the Bridge at North Sydney near the historic Luna Park which also has a swimming pool next door that has amazing views of the bridge and you can take a really nice swim there, it's cool to swim and see the trains go across the Bridge. There are many enjoyable walks in all these areas with lots of photo opportunities. Of course if you love bridges then be sure to checkout Anzac Bridge nearby, if you want to se that check out Sydney Fish Markets and also Jubilee Park in Glebe has amazing views from across the Harbour. Another must-see bridge if you are that way inclined is the Sea Cliff Bridge along the Grand Pacific Drive, but that is 2 hours south of Sydney.Here is a rare tip you won't see many other places; In the east of Sydney is a park called Malabar Headland National Park, this has views of the Bridge that you don't see as often, far in the distance across the Harbour. If you use a telescopic lens as a portrait camera, you will definitely get a rarely seen perspective. The Park is also a fabulous place to visit to unwind, there is swimming and leisurely strolls with beautiful views."

Some of the best times to go are sunset and sunrise. The midday climbs are a bit too hot in the summer and probably best avoided but the choice is there. You'll get kitted up in a jumpsuit and harness and practice connecting and climbing in the climb centre before heading out under the bridge at first along suspension walkways then head up to the top. Up the east side, across the top and down the west. There's a pause for a photo at some point and you can collect the photo at the end."

There is no other way to see Sydney from so high up unless you are in a helicopter! And to make it even more fun is the actual climb itself. We were two adults and a 13-year old and the climb was easy.You get suited up with a special outfit coverall so nothing can fall off. After suiting up they hand out a waist harness and walkie talkies. The latter so you can hear instructions and guide information from your tour leader.Once your group is all set, it's off to climb the bridge.This is a very easy climb and only the ladder steps (I can't remember maybe 90 of them) are a straight up vertical climb. Then you suddenly appear above the roadway on the Eastern arch.Cars are whizzing by as you make the steep climb up.The tour stops now at the bottom of the main arch, so photo time.Another photo op half way up and then again at the very top.All the photos are well done and make great souvenirs.The tour guide talks continuously with useful tip bit and stories about how the bridge was built, how many people were killed building the bridge etc etc.They even take an 8-second video at the very top so rehearse your video ahead of time.After you cross over from the East side, you begin your decent down the West arch.Going down seems a bit of a let down but the tour guide makes it interesting by telling lots of extra facts about Sydney.Back at the base camp, you get the choice to purchase souvenirs. Don't forget to buy your photos. The prices are structured so that you should buy the complete package for about $50 (maybe a bit from memory). You can buy prints or get them on a CD. We did both.In conclusion, you have accomplished not only a feat of climbing one of Australia's most famous landmarks, but also taken in some of the most incredible views of Sydney available to tourists.We were blessed with warm, calm conditions with cloudless skies on December 30, 2015.Highly recommend this adventure!By the way, among our group of 12 people, 9 had received their tickets as gifts! So you can see Aussies like to treat their friends and family to this experience. We were from Los Angeles so bought our tickets."

This activity was better than I expected. The safety focus is immense, as it should be. The tour guide we had was among the best tour guide of any guided experience ever. He made sure our group felt happy, and told us some great history about the building & opening of the bridge - stories I hadn't heard before. We did the first climb of the morning on a gorgeous sunny February morning. This climb felt very moderate & the pace didn't feel too fast or slow. It is definitely suitable for all fitness levels. The most difficult part would be climbing ladders, but you do a ladder climbing drill indoors before you get on the bridge to help you feel comfortable (& I assume to assess any potential concerns). This is expensive, but well worth the experience. You get one free group photo from the top, then need to pay for any additional. Anyone who ever finds themselves in Sydney should try this activity!"

We had free time before joining our NG/.G adventure tour and climbing the bridge at sunset which is the most expensive time to do it seemed to me, like a good thing. Not to my friend who thought it was a waste of money.Our tour started at 6:25 PM on Jan, 18, 2016. We were instructed...we were given a breathalizer (do not drink before climbing) and we were given some kind of space ship suits. It was fun...we went through a metal detector, we left in the locker all our possessions and NO cameras were allowed and you can imagine why, right?You are tied with metal chains to the railing that will be other half from the time you ascend until you descent. Some ladders are completely vertical...others are just like climbing a mountain....the sun sets and you stop to contemplate the sun setting...you stop for pictures...you stop for more sunset pictures....you stop for more pictures...and slowly you reach the top...you see the opera house...and you begin your descend...When you reach your point from where you departed from...you remove your space suit...you have a survey to fill and by the time you are out on the street it is 9:30 and you have to find a place to eat. In Sydney restaurants close at 10 PM.Was it worth it? for me it was. Would I do it again, no. My main and only complaint is the amount of time wasted with the picture taking...if the group has 12 people you have to take pictures for 12 people from different locations. But here is where they make the money. I paid for my photo overlooking the opera house about US$19.00...a little diploma is given to you about the experience. The guy who came up with the idea to make this a climbing bridge is one hell of a businessman!! It is interesting to learn about the bridge...learn about the bridge before you go...Best,"

It is so well organized from safety to staff.When you first arrive at the bridge climb office, you check in and they usher you upstairs for your safety briefing. It's extensive. They breathalyze you and tell you all about what you're going to experience. After you get your gear on, you go through test equipment like up and down stairs and ladders to make sure you can move properly with everything on.Then on to the bridge. It's a guided tour and you have headphones in so the guide explains things like the history of the bridge and fun facts along the way.The view from the top is incredible but the wind chill in January had me freezing even with the jumpsuit on!Definitely a must do."

Constructed during the Great recession of the early 1930's , it was opened to the public on 1932.There are tours which one can take and climb to the top of the bridge but it is pretty costly. We enjoyed the majestic site both from the ferry and from land standing from the opera house.As it is designed in the form of an arch, it is also called as a \"coat hanger\" bridge.A wonderful piece of design and a must see."

Once you actually get out on the bride it is so exciting! The only part that might be a little scary is the four ladders, after that it is a fairly easy walk. Our guide was Bronte and she was excellent, so friendly and she told great stories. The twilight climb is like 3 climbs in one because you see the view in the daylight, the sunset, and then the view in the dark. I think that's why this time slot is so expensive but we thought it was well worth it. As we were descending, the harbor fireworks began and Bronte allowed us to watch them from the bridge! Not a perfect view but an incredibly unique one. Don't leave Sydney without climbing the bridge!"

No photos I'm afraid, except the company guide takes some shots along the way. You receive a group shot, which might I add is the crappiest one of all, and then you are offered to buy their copies at $25.00 a piece. A bit steep if you ask me especially when the climb was limited to the inner rafters and not the outer climb, and the cost is $230.00. We had fun but I think the premier climb wiuld be better. A lot more expensive though."

Yes, it is a bit expensive and probably a once-in-a-lifetime event for most. The climb does have a very good audio system which you are hooked into (my husband has hearing aids and he took them out and found he could hear everything our guide was saying) along with great safety equipment. We are close to 70 and did not have any problems with the climb but we are moderately fit for our age. All in all it was a terrific day, started out with a bit of rain but then it stopped (and they do have rain gear just in case)."

Having only seen images of Sydney Harbour Bridge from over 10,000 miles away in England, it was an absolute must to climb it when we planned our month long trip to Australia. My wife and I are spending four days in Sydney before hiring a car and exploring the east coast up to Cairns before flying home. Our bridge climb was booked for our final day so we have enviously watched groups work their way to the top, posing for photographs along the way. So today it was our turn and what a fabulous three and a half hours it was, we started the process by getting kitted out, and sorting essential health and safety issues. Our guide for the climb was Richard, what a guy ! He is the longest serving guide with over five thousand tours to his name and he brought the climb to life with a blend of anecdotes, stories and factual information. He had been told that if he added the length of all his tours together it would be the equivilant of walking across Australia and half way back again.The climb itself was totally safe with everyone using a slider to hook themselves onto a wire which ran the whole of the climb. Most of the climb was a steady incline with the most strenuous part being a short climb up near-vertical steps to get onto the the main walkway to the top.Obviously the views on the way up and from the top were spectacular and are well worth the effort and cost. It will live long in our memories."

It was our third visit, so we wanted to try something different, and had heard about the Bridge Climb. We made reservations online about 6 months in advance, so we had no trouble getting the specific date and time we wanted. Although sunset climbs were more expensive, the online agent checked the estimated sunset time for our intended month and recommended taking the one just before sunset. That way we got to start our climb in sunshine, and finish with a beautiful setting sun. The climb itself was not arduous or difficult, even for us in our 40s and 50s and the most challenging part (although not at all difficult) was navigating three ladder climbs in a row. Because the bridge steel arches are so wide, we rarely were right up against a sheer drop, so there was no fear of heights or vertigo. The views from the top of the arch of the city and harbor were fantastic, and we could see all the way to the ocean and the harbor heads. It was an exhilarating experience!!"

However for $13 and 1 hour you can climb up the 202 step pylon and get almost the same view. The climbing is indoors with an observation deck at the top. The views are magnificent and certainly worth the effort."

After a guided tour of the Opera house and a super lunch at Caf\u00e9 Sydney atop the old Customs building, what better than a surprise birthday Bridge Climb for my wife.  It had been a 30C day and was still very hot and humid when we turned up at the Bridge Climb Office for the 4:55 pm slot, pre booked by Internet.  The whole organisation is thoroughly professional from the suiting up and equipment briefings to the young guide accompanying us. Jackie, a 2nd year Uni student, was very experienced, socially skilled and as a blue eyed blonde, got my attention from the start, though there is nothing particularly attractive about our grey and blue polyester jump suits.  Everything was done with safety in mind, and at a pace to suit the slower members of our 12 strong group. We did the full Bridge Experience, which was not too strenuous, but lasted in all over 4 hours.  We were fortunate to have a lovely clear sunny day with winds of about 25 km/HR which was pleasantly cooling.  The views are spectacular, and the commentary on the construction and history and anecdotes were very interesting. We saw a lovely red sky as the sun began to set, and we're presented with certificates and a group photo at the top when we finished.  Though it may be considered expensive, it was a great experience which I am so glad to have completed."

Watching the sun set and the lights come on was beautiful. The whole package from check-in to leaving was around 3.5 hours.

We all wore head sets and Megan gave us lots of interesting info and facts along the way. Although not allowed to carry cameras etc for obvious reasons, photos are taken with the opera house and the city in the background. Everything was perfect until we went to pick up our photos when there was a little bit of confusion. We were the last party of the day and my friend and I were the last customers. The girl on the desk was impatient and clearly wanted to go home. It only slightly tarnished an otherwise awesome experience. One further disappointment is we haven't received the free video taken from the bridge despite entering our personal code and leaving my email address - that reminds me must contact them to see if it can be located.

At first we were hesitant because it is costly, but then we figured we'd make an online reservation and just do it since we don't go to Australia very often. We've got to try everything and we're so glad we did this! We decided to do the express climb which was a great decision for us. It's about 2 1/2 hours instead of the 4 hours it normally takes. There is less stopping and standing around and you still get to see everything everyone else sees. The views are awesome. The preparation is very thorough - paperwork, breathalyzer, headset, climbing suit, harness, clip on for the tether, etc. Everything is explained very well. You take nothing up there except for what they give you to take. This is all for safety reasons. They take pictures of you which you receive a free group shot and you have an option of buying other individual pictures. They are not pushy about buying the pictures at all. You don't need to be in great physical shape to do this climb - I'm not in super shape. But, if you are hesitant about going a little faster on the express climb due to not being able to keep up, you might want to choose the longer climbs where they stop more often. I would also recommend doing the climb during the early morning hours if you will be visiting during the warmer months."

The day was a bit overcast but that proved to be a bonus as it kept the climbing cooler. After we were kitted out in our very fashionable gear and given a short talk on what to expect, we were off. There were 13 of us and our guide Chris. He proved to be very knowledgable about the Bridge and kept up a running commentary while we negotiated walkways and ladders. Climbing proved to be very easy and there were water fountains along the way. We were soon way above the traffic looking out over the most beautiful harbour in the world. The views were just marvellous and Chris pointed out many of Sydney's landmarks including, of course, the magnificent Opera House. For safety reasons, nothing can be taken on the climb, including cameras and mobile phones. Chris had a camera and was more than happy to oblige with photo opportunities and when we returned, we could see all the shots he had taken and decide on which ones we wanted.I would suggest before the climb, go through the museum and see how the bridge was built. It is fascinating. And also note all the celebrities who have climbed before you, including a 100 year old lady! Definitely an attraction not to be missed when visiting Sydney."

It was the most amazing experience.The entire experience takes about three hours but you only spend about half of the actually climbing. The first half of the day is spent going through safety and getting kitted out in your jumpsuits and hats and radios.The climb itself isn't particularly strenuous, for the most part it's just like walking up and down stairs (Though my calf muscles were a bit tender for a few days afterwards!!) and you're clipped on the entire way up and down.The guides are very informative and entertaining with lots of stories about the bridge and when it was being built. The stop you in about 3 or 4 places to take photos. I don't think I can describe how beautiful the view is, it's just breath taking. There are points where you can see straight down into the water, but the higher up you get the less that happens. When you're climbing the arch itself you can't see through at all. I'm afraid of heights and I had no problems at all. Seriously, if you do anything in Sydney, let it be this!"

For a greater experience and to view the magic of the bridge itself along with the harbour it crosses there truly is not better experience than the BridgeClimb. As a Sydney Sider who has watched fireworks from the bridge for years, been on the water, walk, driven and caught a train across the bridge I wasn't so sure I would find the bridge climb even more captive but I was very very wrong. The bridge climb is just amazing. Try the last climb before sunset, it is a little cheaper and you can often get the sunset too. To see all aspects, to hear about the amazing engineering of the bridge, how it is so strong and walk its beauty is just magical. If you are worried about being afraid of heights... I can honestly say I was shaking prior to it and for no reason. The arch steps you walk are not steep and its a gradual climb, its not on the edge and you are harnessed in the whole time. The guides are great and allow you to take your own time and check in with you. There are two vertical ladder areas that are not wonderful for those of us scared of heights but if you listen to your guides advise to just pace yourself, and focus on each step, not looking down rather across , it truly makes all the difference."

The climb itself is very safe, climbers are harnessed to the bridge 100% of the climb as well as the climb being almost more of a walk then a climb. Short of a few sets of stairs that a bit steep, the \"climb\" is more of a low inclined walk, you don't have to be super fit to make it to the top.The top of the bridge offers an amazing view of the harbor, opera house, and the city that you can't get anywhere else. Unfortunately, climbers cannot bring cameras along (because of potentially dropping them onto an active road), but the guides stop a view times along the way to take pictures of the climbers. The guides also offer some history and information of the bridge and city during the tour which is interesting to hear.The tour takes a few hours between the preparation, ascent (which includes stops and pictures), and descent. In my opinion, the stops were a bit to frequent and long in duration but some people may enjoy those stops more. For others that may be looking for a bit quicker experience with less stops, there is an accelerated climb option available (which is cheaper and I wish I had given more thought beforehand). The accelerated climb apparently goes further along the underside of the bridge (instead of walking along the top arch) before ascending stairs to the stop of the bridge. I did not take the accelerated climb so I can not say exactly how the experience really compares, but I would consider it if you think ~3 hours may be too long for the climb."

The bridge may look huge, but surprisingly, it is a very gentle climb, with long and shallow steps up to the top of the arch. Before they let you out on the site you are walked through what to do and try out a trial set of steps. The approach to the pylon (the sandstone towers at each end of the Bridge) you actually walk underneath the roadway above and have a great view of the old fort archaeological site below. You are attached to a line securely for the entire time, wearing your very fetching grey onesy. It is not the cheapest attraction, but well worth it."

Bridge climb offers an expensive way to climb to the top with a 2-3 hour experience. East side pylons is open, 9-5pm to walk up with the history of the bridge and a good view ($13 adults/$6.50 kids) which is just as good as the climb in my books. A fun way is to walk one way and get the ferry back so you sail under it. Weekend markets at the Rocks is a great way to finish."

It isn't even too bad if you are slightly wary of heights as the walkway is so wide.That said, I can imagine a rainy day would be miserable and very cold at the top. My only slight gripe was that it took such a long time to do, you need to set aside a few hours and there is some waiting at the top so you can get cold."

The entire fantastic experience took a little over two hours but what an exhilarated two hours. Accompanying you and the whistle of the wind is a babel of tongues ... Mandarine... Korean, Japanese... Israeli and various versions of English. But how does karaoke come into it? Well, when you get to the top, flushed with the gigantic good-feel of your experience, what better way then to express your love than to sing or bellow your version of a song marking the success of your epic climb.

To get into the mix quickly my colleagues and I walked across the Harbour Bridge on a beautiful blue skies day. The walk loosened the muscles and the views kept us looking every step of the way. The iconic opera house, different community views and the bridge itself drew our minds into a place of creativity and teamwork. Many new ideas and recommendations were born crossing those blue waters. It's fantastic that the government keeps this walk open and available to all. Great for families, there is no risk of falling and there are foot police walking the bridge so it is safe. Afterwards make sure to walk down by the water on the opera house side to read the big plaque about the building of the bridge. Then walk up to the right and thru the park. You'll end up at the top of the area called the Rocks, a wonderful area of eclectic shopping and dining. The more adventuresome will want to walk up to the top of the bridge. Visit the storefront where the bookings begin at least and see the many celebrity pictures of them on top of the bridge. Enjoy refreshments at one of many pubs down under on the Rocks. (The pun was unavoidable.). Happy views. J"

The bridge climb is something everyone talks about and it is really a unique experience and view.It was not cheap, our trip was $200 US and it took about 2 1/2 to 3 hours but time flew by. I was a little concerned about the height before we went but never really noticed it once we were going.The crew was very friendly from the get go. From the check in desk to the prep people to the climb guides, they were all sincere in their efforts to make us comfortable and welcome. The prep stage includes signing papers, getting \"suited up\" and a practice climb. You wear a jump suit and everything is attached so nothing can fall off. Even your sunglasses are given clips so you don't loose them. They give you a breath test to be sure you are not impaired. It is really and air test- they have you count to 5 and check what you exhale. They offer a photo package for about $69 USD. While it sounds expensive (and it is) the photos were awesome and they included extra photos of the bridge from the day and night. I think the package was worth it. I love the photos. Everyone gets a group photo.While prepping, we were told due to heat, strip to underwear under jump suit so when you finish you have clean dry clothes to wear. So as a tip, you may want to bring a change of clothes. They give you secure lockers to store your belongings in. The guide told many stories and took the photos while climbing. He made it interesting and continually checked everyone asking if they were ok or had questions. As for the height, it wasn't something to worry about. First of all you are in a harness attached to the railing. The tether slides along as you walk hardly noticeable. The walkway or stairs are about 4 ft wide. The bridge is big enough you feel no fear or worry about being exposed. Prior to going on the bridge they had climb a small set big stairs up and down to be sure you were comfortable and able to do it. To me the climb was more a leisurely walk on some stairs, with numerous stops to take in view and rest. There were two or three water stops. There were ladder like areas in the climb going up to the bridge and quite a few of us banged our shins but nothing serious.I loved it, would do it again and recommend it!!Ps. They go in almost all kinds of weather. They showed up rain gear, headlamps, and fleeces for chilly nights or mornings."

Nicknamed Coathanger it was opened in 1932 by Premier Jack Lang and carries 8 road lanes, 2 rail tracks, 1 pedestrian way and 1 cycleway. It is the sixth longest spanning-arch bridge in the world (1.149 m) and the tallest steel arch bridge (134 m).It's equipped for tidal flow operation, to suit better to the direction of the traffic flow during the rush hour. 8 lanes: 1 and 2 always flow north, 6, 7 and 8 always flow south and the remaining 3, 4 and 5 are reversible. It's a toll bridge and the amount varies from $ 2.50 to $ 4.- depending on the time of the day.Many people want to climb on the top of the arch, something difficult and only for very fit persons. But you may take no photos, because you aren't allowed to carry anything with you. Since 2006 there is an alternative climbing to the upper arches of the bridge.For the pedestrians it's not so easy as it seems to be. From The Rocks area, it's a little bit complicated, because the signposts are not enough.You see the bridge from almost every point of The Rocks but you can't reach it.In short, you must be well prepared for a long walk uphill and another long walk on the bridge itself. The Pylon lookout has another 200 steps to climb but I think the view is almost the same from anywhere on the bridge.Good luck and be patient, the view is worth it!"

The few sets of step ladders were climbed with reasonable ease and once you start on the bridge properly it remains a gentle climb. You don't have to be particularly fit and energetic (though it helps) as you frequently stop and points on the way.I cannot speak more highly of this activity.

We had originally booked a twilight climb to see the bridge in both daylight and at night. It was pouring with rain, but we were provided with rain gear - all we had to do was to wait for the storm to pass as lightening makes it dangerous to climb. We were unlucky that evening and all the climbs were cancelled. We went back a couple of days later for one of the early morning climbs. Although rain was forecast, it stayed dry, cool and clear the entire time. The organisation is just great, our leader/guide was a lot of fun and everyone in our group was delighted with it. The only negative is the price of the bridge top pictures - they just don't need to be that expensive. All in all though, if you are going to Sydney - do this climb - you won't regret it."

The pictures are overpriced - they could be much more reasonable because of the base price of the climb itself. You do get an 8 second video to take with you.We had a great time doing the express climb, which takes from start to finish about 2 1/2 hours, including prep time and changing time (you wear their outfits).

You can pay to go up along the top. We didn't feel like the views would be that much better to pay for it though.At night, the bridge is all lit up and you can see the bats. Don't worry, they are really high up and won't both you. Seeing the bridge at night was awesome. It gives the city a totally different feel.There is security around the bridge 24/7. So we felt more than ok walking around at night. Enjoy!"

During the climb, our guide took 16 photos of us. We purchased the basic photo package (10 photos), plus extra $5 for an additional photo (the 11th photo). So totally we purchased 11 photos. The service girl saved these photos in an USB. As she was not friendly and looked absent-minded, when I returned to hotel room, I checked the USB and found ONLY 10 photos!!! So the next day, which was our last day in Sydney, we had to WASTE our time going to their office. The photo purchase service desk was another girl, who definitely ruined my whole experience. She first apologized and told me she couldn't give me any compensation but only giving me the missing photo. She wanted me to tell her the missing photo's ID number, so that she can save that photo into the USB. How do I know that number? It's like 10 digits! She was then stuck! So I had to figure out a solution. I asked her to give me pen & pencil, and let me know the ID numbers of the existing 10 photos in USB, then we know which photo is missing. For some reason she didn't respond to me even though I kept repeating. She insisted me telling her which photo was missing! I then told her, why not just give me all 16 photos, because after all, your company wasted my last day in Sydney! She refused and kept asking me the ID number of missing photo! Finally annoyed, I told her: if you were me, would you know a specific photo's ID number AT ALL!? Then she told me she couldn\u2019t read that USB on their computer! That was ridiculous! They sold me the USB and they couldn't read it!? And she didn't want to figure out how to solve the problem and keep passing the ball to me???!!! I was then all angry and started to talk loud, so other customers started to notice something was wrong at this service desk. She finally asked her colleague how to read USB but failed. As I started to get really angry, she finally just save all 16 photos in the USB and THREW THE USB TO ME. I was very angry, so I went directly to Customer Service Head. After listening to all what happened, this Customer Service Manager gave me the 2nd ridiculous compensation proposal: he can refund me the extra photo purchased! THAT'S AUS$5!!!!! I didn't want to accept that compensation at all. I told him this does not make me feel any better AT ALL. He gave me a \"there's nothing more I can do\" face. I can only say: terrible experience here!!!!!All in all, the Bridge Climb is a must-do in Sydney! But if you purchase any photos, MAKE SURE THEY GIVE YOU ALL THE PHOTOS IN THE USB, AT THE TIME YOU PURCHASE THE PHOTOS! Otherwise, be prepared to share my terrible experience!"

Thanks Alex for a great experience.I've given this a 5 rating for the climb, the views and Alex.I do understand that there is alot of OH&S associated with doing such a climb, but the other staff were rather unfriendly and abrupt - I think they need to smile a little more and remember that we are all paying big dollars to do it. Getting ready to proceed on the climb does take 45 minutes or so before you even start, and you feel like you're back in cadets given how obsessively regimented the process is, and how much like a drill sergeant the other staff are !Given that it is already expensive, this recent tendency with attractions to 'offer' people photos taken on the climb that staff take (given that you can take nothing on the climb of your own other than your underwear, socks and shoes unless it is tied down - you even have to pass through a metal detector) for an extra $68 is just another way of extorting money from you."

            "review": "A Bucket List Checkmark. This was my only must-do activity on my return to Sydney, a major bucket list item for what was likely my last visit to Sydney. It is indeed a climb of a lifetime, and the experience is totally worth it! I would recommend it to anyone who has good mobility and is not afraid of heights. Don't let age be a discouraging factor if you have good balance.The sights were incredible. The commentary and guidance by our leader, Alex, was second-to-none. I would not have missed this experience for the world. It takes a little nerve, but the pace is reasonable with many stops along the way. The hardest parts are the 4 long sets of open steel stairs to climb up and down, and the wide steps coming down that make it harder on the knees to stretch your gait because you can't really double-step them. Some places you have to bend down or step over to avoid girders. The stairs are not steep, but some steps are long. And.... what I was most concerned about, I didn't need to be... as the steps were not \"open\" to the bridge below. The path is well-planned and safely managed. It took 9 years to develop the Bridge Climb, just as long as it took to build the entire bridge!The safety of the climb is taken seriously, and that is well appreciated. We were asked three times if we had eaten breakfast, if we needed to bring medication with us, had to fill out a complete medical/liability form, and were given a sobriety breath test. You cannot take any cell phone or camera with you. In fact, you can take nothing, not even your clothes, as you have to strip down to your underwear to put on your one-piece zipped climb suit! Sunscreen was provided at the beginning of the climb. There were water faucets available before the actual climb. A safety line was tethered to you and the rail the entire length of the climb, both up and down, even along the stairs. As well, a headset with an FM system was provided so that you could easily hear all instruction and description along the way. There was a preliminary \"practice\" climb of stairs while still in the main building to understand how the safety line worked, and the angle of the stairways on the actual bridge. There was nothing missed in terms of preparedness for the climb, so safety should not be a concern.As part of the fee, you are given a free hat, a certificate for having completed the climb and a picture of the group. There were 14 climbers in our group, and that seemed to be the general number, based on the spaces to sit, etc. before the climb.So, why a 4-rating rather than a 5? Well, there are several reasons. First is the expense - nearly $300, more at specific times or on weekends. Second was the difficulty in understanding the first gal, Jen, who did some of the preliminary preparatory work with us; she spoke so quickly and I had difficulty with her accent. The time requirement, the three and a half hours as advertised, is very deceiving as a \"climb\" experience, as so much of that is spent in preparation. Everything is done in very slow sequence, every clip, hanky, belt, line, hat, form, test, etc. etc. is done one at a time by one group leader who must check every climber for every distributed item (and the reverse at the end). As suits are distributed, time to go to the change room, change, return, help zip... it just takes so much time. Then for the climb, rest spots are as much for individual commercial picture-taking as they are for actual rests. I had not intended to purchase the picture \"package\" at the end, and assumed we would be able to pick our group picture, as many were taken. However, the one we received was a \"be silly\" picture taken as the last one, when everyone had arms flailing or tongues out. It wouldn't have been my choice for this memorable climb.Don't let my negatives stop you, but you should be aware before you decide, especially if you have family members waiting for you. For sure, it is an experience you won't soon forget!"

The walk is not particularly challenging so those who think they can't do it, should give it a try. It is well worth it. Although it seem quite expensive, it is well worth the effort. Also it is worth booking for around midday if you are travelling from outside Sydney. It means an early start to make sure you get there on time, but if you can park at a river boat station (we chose Abbotsford) and take the river cruise, as the views of Sydney are breathtaking and sooooo worth the time taken. A return trip is around $16 so great value and a perfect way to avoid the hassle of driving to find somewhere to park."

You take things slowly which was really good as we were climbing with 2 kids aged 10 and 13. Prior to climbing the bridge, we thought it might be hard going for the kids but it was really easy. If your in Sydney and have the chance to climb the bridge, just do it. Once we were up, we could see as far as the blue mountains and past Bondi beach in the other direction. We were not rushed whatsoever, the guides are brilliant passing on a lot of information."

However, having talked through, with my son, the limiting impact fears can have on what we do and experience in life I decided to be super brave. Before we travelled to Australia I practised walking on openwork walkways to build my confidence and tolerance of such things - almost a desensitisation process. This helped however I was still very apprehensive. Before we started the climb the group were asked if anyone was apprehensive - I was the only one who admitted to this. Safety was very much high on the agenda of all the staff - we had to pass a breathalyser test and a climbing assessment. During the climbing assessment techniques for safe ascent and descent were taught.Sarahh, our leader was absolutely superb. She was so knowledgeable, fun and her enthusiasm was so infectious. She kept a discreet yet watchful eye on me which was very reassuring. Due to the care, support and encouragement of Sarah, my son and my husband - I did it, so enjoyed it and would have missed out on the most breathtakingly, beautiful experience.You are fixed to a rail at all times so oh so safe. The climb is made up if a few ladders but mainly a guarded walkway the incline of which is surprisingly gentle or so it seemed to me. Sarah was also very good at using viewing points as opportunities for us to have a breather. It was all so well managed.The views, oh my goodness, how do I describe them - spectacular, beautiful, breathtaking, just so good for the soul. We did the twilight climb which had the advantage of us being able to watch sunset over the harbour - another wow experience.The whole experience was so good in confidence building that I am going to try indoor climbing with that inspirational son of mine.A totally, amazing experience - not to be missed. Our other son has a walking disability and wasn't with us on this part of the trip. Having done the climb I am wholly confident he could do it so in 2017 we are back to Sydney for us all to do the climb together. Keep your fingers crossed for us that he will pass the climbing assessment.If you're apprehensive do grab your courage in both hands - it is so, so worth it!"

To appreciate this walk you need to research when the full moon rises early over Cremorne Ridge line of the Lower North Shore of Sydney. You want the moon at least above Cremorne Ridge line and commence the walk after sunset to see moonlight shimmering down the Harbour illuminating Fort Denison, Clark and Shark Island and the Sails of the Opera House. So the walk is best done well after twilight. This is not \"Bridge Climb\", merely walking as pedestrians at night across Sydney Harbour Bridge at street level toll free with a view of the main Eastern approaches of Port Jackson/Sydney Harbour. I suggest that you walk North about one hour after moonrise (once it is dark). Then you will have the moon shining towards you from the Harbour's entrance. Enter the Sydney Harbour Bridge Eastern (Ocean) side, as the Western side of the Bridge is a bicycle route (Olympians even training every night) at: (1) Circular Quay as the Eastern side provide lifts (near Wharf 2) up to Cahill Expressway and walk, enjoying the view looking down over Circular Quay. (2) Argyle Street, up the steep stone steps under Cumberland Street leading up to Cumberland Street and the steep stairway entrance up to the Sydney Harbour Bridge from Cumberland Street (do not be tempted until later the same night on your return by either or both pubs being the Australian Heritage Hotel or the Glenmore Hotel that are diagonally opposite the entrance); (3) if coming from CBD, the steps in Cumberland Street just north of the Shangri-La Hotel. One exits at the Northern end of the Bridge at Milsons Point/Kirribilli, just before one gets to the Milsons Point Railway Station. Walk is under 20 minutes each way. One can: . have dinner at Kirribilli, as their are lots of restaurants as you descend the steps at Milsons Point/Kirribilli; . consider the Sailing Club, Sydney Flying Squadron in McDougall Street; . take the train back to Wynyard Station (easy) or ferry back from Milsons Point wharf or Kirribilli wharf to Circular Quay (if you know its timetable, as many ferries are only hourly at night). I used to walk on my home from work in the CBD to our house in Neutral Bay. Plenty of fit young people are walking or jogging home, especially as working hours finish. Take your camera, wife and mistresses to see who enjoys the walk the most. This is a very cheap idea for anyone visiting Sydney who wants a magnificent evening out (moon permitting). The article probably needs technically improving by those who use it. Great training I suspect for the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco. Daily weather (including rain radar) and moon updates see can be found on the following web sites:\u2022 Bureau of Meteorolgy (BOM) with focus on Sydney weather and Sydney rain radar \u2013 but no moon information\u2022 Weatherzone \u2013 Sydney\u2022 Searching the words \u201cMoon Sydney\u201d."

It connects the city to the northern Sydney suburbs and is affectionately called the Coathanger. There are many ways to experience it: you can take a helicopter ride or do the BridgeClimb. They cost a lot and to visitors on a tight budget, every little bit counts. A BridgeClimb can set you back by about A$200. Fret not, dear visitors, you can get an equally exhilarating experience by just walking the bridge from one end to another. Just head to the historic CBD suburb, The Rocks, and make for Cumberland Street where Shangri-La Hotel is. Diagonally opposite the hotel are steps that take you up to the top where you can start your leisurely walk and take in the spectacular harbour views, the Opera House, and gawk at sunbathers by the pool of the A$1000-a-night Hyatt.The walk takes between 20 and 35 mins depending on your pace. It ends at a flight of steps and if you have time to spare, descend them and head towards the Kirribilli waterfront where more harbour vistas await. At Kirribilli, you can catch a ferry from one of its public wharves to Circular Quay and to Manly, Mosman or Taronga Zoo to see the bridge from the harbour."

There were grassy areas below the bridge for people to sit. Just make sure you enjoy Sydney Harbour at night...we found it mesmerizing.

Pre climb training gives you a small glimpse into how it will work....lockers provided for belongings but not suitable for very large rucksacks....

When wearing their jump suites, it was recommended to wear only under garments - I am glad I did, as can get quite warm .Fantastic views up there - 360 views of Sydney. Understandbly you cannot take anything up with you, no cameras, phones, jewellery etc, don't want anything falling on traffic below.We purchased the photo pack, it was worth it.

Coming to Sydney, people often look forward to see Opera House albeit I was more blown away by the iconic giant of the Harbour Bridge. You can have a nice 30 mins walk across the bridge that starts from The Rocks to the other side at Milsons Point. The walk is picturesque with the hustle of traffic and infamous Sydney Cityrail on the other side. The pedestrian area is cordoned off with railings on both sides and it is truly a magnificent structure. Preferable to go in Sunny weather to capture the true beauty of Sydney Harbour as seen from the Harbour bridge."

The walk from one side to the other is approx 1.5Km (3.0Km return). Views are simply amazing. Walkers are on the eastern side of the bridge and cyclists on the western footpath. If you are visiting Sydney don't miss the Pylon lookout - (Adults $13 Children 5-12 $6.50 4 & Under - Free) at the top of the South East Pylon - enter from the footpath as it crosses the Southern pylon. Walk up the stairs to an exhibition all about the bridge and up to the viewing deck which has 360 degree panoramic views of Sydney. Much cheaper than Bridge Climb! If you are particularly keen on the design of the Bridge go down to the waterfront and inspect the hinges on each side that essentially support the bridge. Amazing engineering from the 1930's. Options for those who want a shorter walk are walk across and catch either the train (Milsons Point Station) or ferry (Luna Park Wharf) back to the city. Longer walk options include continuing south at the southern exit by heading UP the stairs and walking along the footpath on the Cahill Expressway to Circular Quay for another view of the Quay from the undercover viewing platform. Great shots of the bridge from here too."

I think we paid around $933 AUD which I guess is around \u00a3150 each for the three of us, well worth it.

We booked on line, direct with 'Bridge Climb' before we left the UK. We wanted to make sure we got the day and most suitable time for us. We only had a short stay in the City before moving on. We arrived in Sydney on 1st December and had booked our trip for 3rd December at 11.05 a.m. We did the full climb. I'd recommend this to everyone. Please give it a go. Such an amazing thing to do! The day before our climb, we strolled from our hotel, The Tank Stream in Pitt Street, which was approx 10 mins from the Bridge Climb, which is 5 Cumberland Street, The Rocks. We wanted to ensure we arrived in plenty of time on the day, and also to get our bearings. So easy to find, not a problem. Before the climb, everything is explained, your group are all showed what to do, you're given all the equipment and you get to practice before, going up the ladders. using the safety harness. Our instructor was brilliant. He had a great sense of humour and was a great tour guide. You are required to take a breath test before doing the climb, to make sure you are fit to climb and not under the influence of drink. You have everything you need equipment wise, including headphones, to hear instructions and take in the commentary. Don't let age put you off, we are both senior citizens me 65 and my husband 71. We are fit and active but this is not strenuous. We had lady in our group who was celebrating her 80th Birthday, accompanied by her granddaughter. This is a very safety conscious environment, without spoiling the thrill of the climb. The ladders are a little bit daunting at first but then the steps on the bridge are easy to do. The views are mind blowing. You can't take a camera with you but you can have photographs taken and purchase as many as you like when you've completed the climb. You're given a photo and a certificate as part of the 'Climb Package'. We purchased the photo pack, which we had on a pen drive. Reasonably priced. We are so pleased we did it!!! The organisers of The Bridge Climb have every reason to be proud of this attraction. 10/10!"

You cannot miss seeing it when walking around the foreshore of Sydney and for its age it was built with a lot of foresight to carry the amount of traffic it carries. You can walk across it or even walk over it with the Bridge Climb which I highly recommend. You can also walk up the pylon closest to the city to look at some of the history of the building of the bridge. On New Years Eve it is also the highlight of the New Years fireworks."

Well, obviously the Harbour Bridge is the main icon in Sydney, and it's as impressive as the pictures suggest!I walk across it as well as over it whilst in Sydney and both were amazing experiences. On the way back from Luna Park, we opted to walk from the North side (where Luna is situated) back to the South (where the City is) The views are incredible and well worth doing! I also walked over it with a group of friends and was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life. The experience from start to finish is incredible. Our guide Callum was extremely personable and made each and every one of us comfortable with both the safety procedures and also the entire walk, and was extremely knowledgeable about the all aspects of the history of the bridge. If you have a fear of heights, this will conquer it! It's extremely safe, and if you can do this, you can do anything! It may seem pricey, but you do have to remember this is around a 3-4 hour incredible experience, so make sure you book in advance and do it!"

If I had limited time to visit Sydney the first thing I would do would be to walk across (and over if your budget allows!) the Sydney Harbour Bridge and feel the impressiveness of this iconic construction built long before the time when anyone could have imagined how much it would be used. Walking across is free. You can do it at any time of day and stop and soak up the views for as long as you want. Early morning sunrise would be spectacular. Walking over the curve of the bridge is a great experience offering arguably the best views of Sydney Harbour. It is not scary at all, unless perhaps if you suffer from vertigo. The tours are conducted safely and professionally. Having the permit and safety facilities to run such an operation must be expensive so do expect to pay for the privilege. It's not something you can do on every bridge around the world ... we thought it was worth it as a unique experience."

We went as a family of four and whilst the initial expense seemed off-putting (it was nearly AUD900) my wife who persisted in saying we should go, won out. I am so glad she did. Truly memorable, professionally put together and the guide was excellent. He was well informed, entertaining and certainly added to the overall experience.The whole trip took around 3 hours and at no point seemed stretched out. The pre-climb training session initially seemed unnecessary (how difficult can it be to go up and down a ladder?) was handled efficiently and the value of doing so became very apparent; as on the bridge, where it became very obvious, just how difficult it would be to teach someone on the bridge itself.We were in a party of 12 (ish) and this seemed very manageable. The climb itself is gradual but continuous. Members in our groups were afraid of heights and there are some moments that those with vertigo really might struggle. The guide was great at constantly being considerate of this. The kids took it in their stride and at no point did any of us feel unsafe or ill prepared.We had a blue sky day and amazing views. It was quite warm but a breeze took the edge off. I would be wary about doing the climb on a super hot day as there's little shelter from the elements and if it was raining or very windy it could ruin it for you too. It is very exposed!The walk included 'a' picture and this to me was the only downside. You can't take your own cameras. I would have loved to take photos and considering they allow you to clip other bits to your jumpsuit (sunglasses & hanky) this seemed particularly draconian. In the age of gopros and camera attachments it seemed a real shame they didn't have an option (even if it came with a cost) to shoot your own footage. The views are incredible, the ascent majestic and when the seaplane skimmed over us at the top of the bridge (so close we could see the passengers clearly) and waggled his wings at the waving kids, it was one photo opportunity after another!To be honest though we went for the memories, not the photos, and it will be one ingrained in my families travel log forever. It's certainly not the cheapest of tours but we all felt it was well worth every cent!"

They did the climb close to Sunset. So initially they saw the city and harbour in daylight then when the sun set they saw all the beautiful lights. Sydney is a fantastic city to visit.

Coming from Sydney originally, and recently back for a visit with family, I was amazed to realize when walking the bridge with my Mum, that neither of us had ever gone up a pylon. As we crossed we discussed whether you still could, and as we came upon the one closest to the city & Circular Quay, there was an open door with admission price sign, and a staircase beckoning. My 84 year old mother easily made it up all 200 or so stairs - which are shallow-rise and in sections, with things to look at on the way up. The top is the next best thing to doing the Bridge Climb if you can't afford that, because the views are amazing. Even just walking across this gargantuan bridge is an adventure and an easy and wonderful way to get high above the harbour, the city, the boat traffic, etc. Start at one end and catch the train back to the other, or a ferry or even a bus. It's so easy. Then of course there's the Bridge Climb - which is probably a separate review topic - but is the only way to go up to the very top of the bridge. I've done this twice in the past, and it's a little pricey, but an iconic activity, and very safe (in spite of what one might think).If you're not into heights, just walk down around the two bridge ends, from either The Rocks/Circular Quay on the city side, or from Milson's Point Station on the other end - or from the ferry at Luna Park and at Kirribilli (Jeffrey St Wharf). Stunning stunning stunning, any way you experience this iconic piece of engineering."

I decided to give it a miss as it was too expensive. My wife and friends with their 11 year old son then decided to walk across the bridge which is free of charge. It was a nice walk with cool wind blowing. We could see the view of the famed Opera House.

In those days' you travelled on shanks's pony - your feet. What an experience. A stop at the pylon to view the city from way up there was a treat and a half. The best thing about the pylon were the cats. They used to live up there (until some idiot thought it was a good idea to throw them off, albeit one by one over a great period of time). We heard about the demise of the cats over the radio. There were no television's in those days. Now I'm 72 and it's still a pleasure going over the Bridge. Of course the desired method of travel is by car. Maybe one day I might 'stroll' over the Bridge one last time."

He gave me a very funny and concerned look then told myself that he knew of no show tonight or any night other than New Year\u2019s! I then asked why he and the other officers were standing there as he then explained it was to keep tourists like \"myself\" OFF the road so that it was clear for emergency vehicles.

We quite enjoyed the many waterways and the Harbour - it reminded us of a larger, \"big city\" Venice experience.We discovered the BridgeClimb Sydney adventure as a different way to experience the Sydney Harbour Bridge. After a safety briefing and getting outfitted in safety gear our guide lead us to climb up into the iron work of the bridge until we were walking along the top of the arch. The views were absolutely incredible as we could view the entire expanse of the harbour. And it was a bit surreal to be nearly at eye level with a helicopter flying overhead at one point, as well as ascending the bridge directly next to the train tracks and motorway. Reminiscent of a cartoon character popping its head out of the manhole only to have cars whizzing by :)The guide was awesome, providing an informative talk track to our journey up and over the bridge, sharing the history of the bridge so we could appreciate the beauty of the bridge and the effort that went into its construction. Participants are not allowed to bring ANYTHING with them on the climb. They provided lockers where we stored our cameras, wallets, clothing, etc. It was disappointing not to be able to be able to photograph our experience; however, the guide does stop periodically to take photo ops and those pictures are available for purchase at a fairly reasonable cost. She also took a couple videos that they also copied onto our photo disk/flash drive for no extra cost.I would recommend allowing at least 3 hours for the experience, and would suggest reservations as a must to guarantee your participation at a time that is convenient to your plans. It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, a big hit during our family vacation!"

The staff welcome you with open arms and go through a series of essential safety messages to make sure your climb is faultless. The equipment you are given is comprehensive but definitely not for the fashion concious! Your guide, in our case a very charismatic guy called Romeo, will know you by name before you set out, amazing given the number of people he takes each day. The climb begins easily with a flat section followed by a narrow and quite steep climb up six ladders. Then the fun begins! The rest of the climb is moderately easy. As you go higher the views become more awesome. We did a twilight walk so started in daylight with it getting darker the higher we went. There are plenty of stops to enjoy the views and get your breath back. Although you are not allowed to take your own cameras there are good photos taken buy your guide which can be bought for about $20 each, well worth it and a great souvenir. You get a certificate, hat and group photo in the initial cost of the climb. Once at the top you feel as if you are on top of the world, physically and emotionally, WOW!! On the way down it was dark, seeing all the lights of the city was spectacular. This is something you have to do and is worth every dollar."

Even my missus has grown this habit and every now and then tells me to take her to our 'special date' and off we go with our camera, some comfy shoes and a coat (is always windy) just in case anybody gets cold. You could also just run to the other side and back (really fun) as there are literally thousands doing it every morning / afternoon as their preferred route.If you are a little bit sensitive with the noise of cars (like me), try to go after 8pm or really early in the morning when there is no traffic, otherwise get some ear pods to block some of the noise.Peckish after the walk? head to some of the restaurants next to the bridge (Kirribilli side) or get something to eat at the Rocks (or head to Pancakes on The Rocks, recovering all the kilojoules/calories you have burned multiplied by 3) finishing it with a relaxing time watching the boats go by in Circular Quay."

The strange bit was that the scariest part for me was not climbing the bridge itself, but rather the pylons and walkways which lead on to the Bridge. The steps on the Bridge itself are solid, but the ones leading up to it are iron lattice, so they're see through. Which is a bit daunting when you're 3 or 4 storeys up, and going up fairly quickly. In no time at all you're on the Bridge. The individual photos are a bit steep in price. There's a cafe and toilets, and a great souvenir shop."

Bridges are built to facilitate crossings, not to make them more arduous. However, our daughter who lives in Melbourne, joined us on this leg of our trip and definitely wanted to climb the \"coat hanger\", but not on her own. We lent each other moral support and signed on for a climb at 09h15 - a good time to go if in summer, before it becomes too warm. This attraction id definitely a \"fashion equalizer\" as all visitors have to leave all clothing (but the basics) and possessions that may be accidentally dropped and change into a standard \"onesie\". Added to this are a baseball type cap, safety belt and small radio receiver and headphones (to hear commentary and instructions from the guide). Each group is small (no more than 16 persons) and, whilst attached to a safety line for the duration of the climb, the group is not \"tied together\" so a moderate to slow progress is made. This overcame the greatest concern of all climbers who did not wish to be responsible for delaying the entire party for some reason (other than a major emergency). Safety is paramount but all concerns were swept aside by the fascinating history of the construction of the bridge and anecdotes related by our guide. I have now added the Bridge Climb to my bucket list (and ticked it off)."

We got into a top-gun type jumpsuit, put on a waist harness and strapped ourselves to the cabling that runs all the way up to the top of the bridge. About 1300 stairs - and according to fit-bit - about 6000 steps total -- some amazing views. I only wish we could have taken up our cameras - but nothing extra is allowed (no jewelry, cameras, bags, etc - since any of these can fall down onto the highway running through below). Definitely do this - you won't regret it. It's not nearly as taxing of a walk/climb as it looks."

The whole process ran really smoothly and is seamlessly organised and the catered to everyone in the group, including an older couple and someone scared of heights. It is expensive, but not for a single second did I regret spending the money, it's a must do if you're ever in Sydney!If you're contemplating it but are unsure about fitness, there's only one long part of stairs, and just as you begin the question how much longer you climb for, you're there. Incredibly doable for any fitness level. The stairs also directly follow the curvature of the arch and are not steep at all and hardly feel like stairs. If you're scared of heights and contemplating the climb, the scariest part is the beginning catwalk, in which you can see the ground below you. But it only gets less scary from there, and the higher you go, the less you can see beneath you and the more view you get of the opera house."

The whole experience took about four hours, with the first hour devoted to getting kitted up with clothing, a radio, headlamp etc and practicing how to climb up and down the ladders safely. The sound quality of the radio was crystal clear. As we came down the climb, it was getting dark, and the lights were coming on in the city, on the opera house and around the harbour - the view was stunning. This is a fantastic, fascinating and fun thing to do, and I would definitely recommend it, and would go again if I ever had the opportunity to do so."

We finally got around to the bridge on our last day in Sydney and, now that we've taken the walk, I realize we'd have really missed out on an amazing experience had we not done this. Wow, talk about stunning vistas of Sydney's harbor, the city, and the suburbs in every direction.We began our walk at the Circular Quay elevator, riding up to the highway level at the top floor. We were gawking in every direction during the walk. This is the most ideal location in the entire city for people watching and for taking pictures.We didn't know until we got on the bridge span that you can climb right up to the top inside one of the concrete pylons for an even higher vantage point, for a fee of $13. Seniors pay $8.50. There's an educational video to watch too. We didn't have time to stop, as we'd planned to meet friends on the north side of the bridge.People looking for an adrenaline rush can arrange to climb up to the flag on the very top of the bridge's steel arch, as part of a group adventure. The cost is about $150. Our entire walk was probably a mile from start to finish. You can walk back across, of course, or you can hop on a train at the north side of the bridge. Or if you head down to the north waterfront, you can catch a ferry back to Circular Quay."

We had originally planned to do a bridge climb, but due to a shortage of time on our first day, we decided to delay the climb to our final day, and just walk across the lower, traffic level. After doing so, we decided that the view offered of the harbor, opera house and city skyscrapers wax real all we would have expected of the climb, do we scratch the higher clim version, which jensen approximately $200 per person. Unless you really enjoy heights, and a fairly strenuous climb, or just want to be able to boast that you did the Sydney Bridge climb,mypu may wish to try just the free lower level crossing first. It sufficed for us, and was a worthwhile, much shorter activity."

One of the 5 most known icons for any visitor to Sydney along with the Sydney Opera House, Sydney Harbour, Bondi Beach and Manly Beach.You can drive over it, bus over it, train over it, cycle over it, walk over it and climb over but did you know that you can climb into it .... which is why I am writing this review!I am amazed by the number of visitors to Sydney that I meet who know about the (quite expensive) Harbour bridge climb but who know nothing about the MUCH cheaper (about $20) climb you can do up into the south-eastern pylon (the one nearest Circular Quay) which contains a small museum of the building of the bridge, including a 15 min audio visual movie, which is very interesting and takes you up to the observation level of the pylon giving you breathtaking 360 degree views over Sydney and the harbour, and at a height that is only a little less that what you get to, if you do the expensive bridge climb!I would say to anyone contemplating the bridge climb - do this first and then decide whether the approx $A300 for the climb is worth it (while you are on the observation deck you will see several groups in various stages of the climb). Adrenalin junkies will have to do the bridge climb but $A300 does buy you access to lots of other fun things to do in Sydney - it's worth thinking about that before you spend it on the climb.There is no lift that I know of, so wheel-chair access may not be possible - The Rocks Information Centre, which is only a few hundred metres away just off George street, on the corner of Argyle & Playfair Streets, can give you directions on how to get from them to the pylon (stairs are involved) and advise on wheel-chair access. I'd guess there are several hundred stairs in the pylon you must climb but they do have seats on the platforms at different levels so you can rest if needed.Welcome to my city, I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have."

We left in a group of 14 with a team leader who explained things as you do the walk. Photos were taken at various points as you are not allowed to carry anything with you. The views are fantastic and it was lovely seeing thee sunset on the way down. I would recommend it to anyone."

There are staff members stationed at strategic spots to assist anyone who can't complete the climb back to terra firma.

The bridge is architecturally magnificent and it'll help if you learn about the enormous efforts that were spent on constructing this icon. Even by initially looking at it at a distance from the Opera House, my eyes were caught. My wife and I did the hyped Bridge Walk but very much regretted wasting a good amount of dollars and valuable 3 hours - it was just boring and over touristy, especially after spending a good amount of time with the nature in Tasmania. We were exhausted after the walk, not physically but mentally by the noise of the contruction site under the bridge, passing trains and vehicles, boats, and everything else inevitably coming at you. But again, the bridge itself is well worth a visit."

Coming from the south west I caught a train over to milsons point and started my walk from there. The steps leading up to the cahill expressway were right there and weren't as many as I thought. There were many photo opportunities and security guards positioned along the way. It wasn't as easy to get back to circular quay though. There are steps down into argyle street but be on the lookout for a small entrance on the right hand side of the road only a few meters after the stairs. So if you want to head to the quay from the stairs, don't blink or you will miss the entry point."

The preparations is thorough and orderly with a guide who explains everything you need to know as well as interesting historical facts about the bridge & surrounding area. The total time is 3.5 hrs. so it is a leisurely pace. There is also a \"Sampler Bridge Climb\" the goes up the inner span of the bridge vs. the outer span for the regular climb. Nothing is allowed on the bridge incl. cameras, cells, etc. I paid $213 USD so I do not know if there is a better \"deal\" elsewhere but it was well worth it. There is also a small gift shop in the lobby of the bridge climb area. The view is fantastic and the guide takes photos of the climbers along the way. You get one group photo and one generic photo and individual packages if you wish to purchase. I did not as the line was way too long at the check-out."

Something that you really should do if you are in Sydney.As tehy prepare you for the walk / climb, you get a sense of anticipation. When the tour starts adn all teh formal \"training\" fopr safety has been compelted, you move out. The climb is not difficult and is really easy and paced to cater for all ages and fitmess types.Taks the time to do this and see the sites of Sydney and the Harbour, learn the history of the bridge and the effort to build her.Well worth the small amaount of time out of your life to experience something magical."

I had all kinds of fear about the climb but they were tossed to the wind the minute we set off a a group, led by Alastair, an excellent guide who provided very clear instructions and told us stories about the bridge along the way. Did you know that SIX million hand driven rivets and 53,000 tonnes of steel were used in its construction?!The weather was very kind on the day of our climb. Upon reaching the top of the bridge, I felt a sense of achievement. I am not the fittest of all, but still found the climb easy compared to the Yellow Mountain climb in China. All the safety measures were in place and everything was so professionally organized. Very impressive indeed!"

And they don't let you bring your phone or camera - you have to buy the pics they take of you on the bridge. Instead, walk across the bridge for FREE, to the Pylon Tower Building. Climb 200 steps. You will be starting out above the halfway point for those that are doing the big climb. It's about $15 per person. There's places to rest in the stairwell if you need. Get to the top and enjoy the panoramic views, and you will be higher than some of the people on the arch (not the tippy top, obviously). There's a little museum halfway up with the history. Oh, and bring your camera and phone and take as many pics as you like, at no extra charge."

The Harbour Bridge, like the Opera House, are immediately recognizable symbols of Sydney, as well as beautiful pieces of architecture and engineering. They are also both outstanding locations from which to soak in the beautiful city and harbor. Some favorite spots along the Harbour Bridge follow\u2026BRIDGE CLIMB This is a well-known and exhilarating tour that takes you to the top of Sydney Harbour Bridge, with spectacular panoramic views from the summit of Sydney Harbour, Opera House, city, etc. A must do on your visit to Sydney; you can also do sunset, evening climbs. On the tour, you will move as part of a group through tunnel that passes through the bridge foundation, and on to catwalks suspended under the bridge deck, up a set of ladders (as always attached by harness to a guidewire), through the bridge deck (where traffic passes), and then onto the wide, gently sloped stairs that you will climb (well more walk than climb) to the summit of the bridge. At the summit you'll enjoy the grand view from a height of 130m / 400f + of a large swath of beautiful Sydney Harbour, skylines along both north & south sides of the Harbour, the Opera House, Circular Quay, etc. You're given quite a while to soak in the view. On a sunny day, with bit of wind, it's an amazing place, view, experience. The guide will take another group photo, and then will call over each set of folks (couples, families, friends, individuals) for photos from summit. After that, the easy walk & climb down; or, basically the above in reverse ;) BRIDGE PYLON The Sydney Habour Bridge has four pylons \u2013 large cement towers atop the foundations for the four main bearings (two at each end) that anchor the bridge; and, one of these, the South East Pylon is accessible to the public and has a lookout atop it. This is a great companion activity, or alternative if time and budget demand, to the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb. The top of the pylon, at 87 meters (285 feet) above the harbor, offers great views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge (up close), the Opera House, the Circular Quay, and the Harbour itself. The entrance fee is modest at AU$13 for people over 13 years in age. It is open every day until 5p. There is a bit of a climb (200 stairs), but exhibits and stops break up the climb if needed. Since the Harbour Bridge Climb does not, for obvious reasons relating to falling objects, permit cameras atop the bridge \u2013 this, then, is the best alternative for taking photographs from a similar vantage point. The views are outstanding. BENEATH THE BRIDGEThere are parks beneath the south and north ends of the bridge, along the harbor shore. Dawes Point, at the south end, has Dawes Point Park. It is in close proximity to the sites of The Rocks area and the Circular Quay; and, has a grassy area for picnics. At the north end of, and below, the bridge, lies Bradfield Park, which is larger and offers great views of the Sydney skyline, Opera House, Bridge, etc."

Although famous for the bridge walk the SHB is an amazing structure to view from underneath. If you are staying on the city side take a walk across the pedestrian path (its free) to the other side. The views may not be as spectacular as from the top of the bridge however you will still get great views of the harbour and the Opera house. When you reach the other side head down the stairs and take a right hand turn back towards the water. Follow the path beside the bridge until you hit the grass area under the bridge. This is one of my favourite spots to hang out and read a book or listen to music. The views across the harbour and the steel construction under the bridge are amazing. When you are done head over to one of the cafes in Kirribilli for a coffee. My personal favourite is Bacino. Great coffee and gelato. Enjoy"

Strangely enough, you take a breathaliser test before being allowed to climb. I have Angina, which I take pills for and had no problems with the climb.The crew there are friendly and great and go through a lot of safety checks with you. Don't worry about falling off, because you are connected via a safety wire throughout the climb. Total time is about two and a half hours, but if you are only in Sydney once, do it. You will find, by looking at the many photos in the entrance, you will have taken part in an experience that many famous people have had.

However, the best photo of both the SYD Harbor Bridge & Opera House is from an area near Mrs. Macquaries Chair.Walking East from CQ boat docks/train station:It is an easy 5 minute walk from CQ boat docks/train station to The Opera House .A 15 minute walk from the Opera House to Mrs. Macquarie's chair in the Royal Botanic Gardens."

Was a little scared when I first set off as it looks a long way down but the higher I got the safer I felt. The hi light of the walk was getting to watch a perfect sun set as the sun disappeared behind the blue mountains. That alone was worth every penny. The photographs that were taken have turned out brilliant. There is some great history to be learnt too as you walk up and over"

No need to pay for a tour to see sights from the bridge--just walk it...There are tours that will guide you above the traffic level over the arch of the bridge, and we saw people on that tour when we crossed the bridge. But, you can easily walk the bridge without spending the $100+ and get some panoramic photos all on your own. We walked from Circular Quay, through the Rocks (Argyle Street to Cumberland), and across the Harbor Bridge toward Milson\u2019s Point Station on the northeast point of the bridge. Distance is approx 2.5 km (approx 1.5 miles); time, about 50 minutes one way (going 2.5 -3.0 km/hr). Access to the Bridge is a set of steps near The Rocks at Argyle and Cumberland. Except for the steps up to the bridge access, the walk is wide, paved, and mostly level with slight rise in elevation from each end to the midpoint. There is a fence separating you from traffic on the bridge. There are excellent photo opportunities to the east. Best photos after sunrise are in the afternoon with the sun at your back. (Photos toward the west are difficult since you would be photographing across traffic. Sunset photos are better quality on the paid tour where you are on the arch above the traffic.) We walked the bridge south to north, and back, on a windy afternoon in late October. It was invigorating but very do-able. Beautiful shots of the Opera House, downtown, and Harbor areas. Restrooms: none. Refreshment: none. Patrolled by security officers at intervals. Take water, wear a hat securely fastened and walking shoes, apply sunscreen, take your camera. Enjoy one of Sydney\u2019s icons up close and personal. Excellent photos of the bridge with Opera House are possible on ferry rides, day and night, from Darling Harbor to Circle Quay. My favorite photo of the bridge with opera house is from Macquarie Point (near Mrs. Macquarie\u2019s Chair)."

Check weekends operating .The southern side starts down near the historical area of the Rocks\" in the heart of the city. Have big markets here at weekend.

They do have ladders at the beginning, but there are only 4 sets of about 24 steps on each ladder. You are more enclosed (not tightly enclosed) when climbing the ladders. They make you go one person at a time on each ladder for safety. The stairs are wide and easy to walk on. We would absolutely do this again. We stayed in The Rocks area so this was about a 5 minute walk from our hotel - very convenient! The whole thing lasted about 3-3.5 hours, with about 45-60 minutes of that being the orientation/hooking up your harness/hats/sunglasses, etc."

Views of the city are brilliant too. Would recommend walking all the way across the bridge down the steps at the other side and you will find yourself in a beautiful little village called Kirribilli. Here you can wander round some lovely little shops. Have a bite to eat and if you turn left when you get to the bottom of the stairs walk straight ahead and you will find yourself at the waters edge from here you can take in the views of the Ooera House and Sydney itself. You can either walk back over the bridge to Sydney or wait for the ferry to take you back to a Circular Quay in Sydney. Would also recommend walking to the centre of the bridge at night the views of the Opera House and Sydney at night is truly breathtaking."

We had a great guide (Chris) who gave my wife the confidence to do the climb. It was raining when we started so they gave us waterproof jackets and trousers. You cannot take anything with you other than prescription glasses which is right when you consider the height and danger of dropping anything. Don't worry though as your guide will take plenty of photos (and a free video) which are not expensive to buy.Views were obviously amazing, a must if you are in Sydney."

They dress you in blue coveralls, buckle you into a safety harness attached to a cable and give a very informative safety lecture prior to embarking on a once in a lifetime opportunity!!!You are a little apprehensive at first but your guides have a very calming effect and before you know it you are moving up at a good pace. The views of the harbor, opera house, and city lights are incredible and once you reach the top, the photo ops spectacular. You hate to come back down but like any good thing this comes to an end---not true as you will recall this experience like it happened yesterday. Oh and it will bring a giant smile to your face!"

Well worth the effort to experience this wonderful icon of Australia, and get a great birds eye view of the traffic below you, the beautiful harbour and opera house, and all the attractions of Sydney as far as the eye can see!Pose for your photos & take them home as great souvenirs, and great memories ! A absolutely must-do experience if you only ever visit Sydney once or more often. Take a walk under the bridge to visit the cafes, restaurants and lovely shops there, and walk around to darling harbour only 15 mins away. Or jupmp on a train or ferry ride anywhere from nearby Circular quay. Walk through the historical Rocks areas, and maybe join a Ghost Tour around the area also. Some stories involve the Harbour Bridge!Don't forget there's a twilight bridge climb also, see the city light up as dusk falls, magical! Be a dare devil , do both climbs during your stay!!!! I absolutely love going to the harbour to see the bridge, from all different view points."

I thought I could get a close-enough view by walking the bridge. Ah, but the difference between walking the bridge (like a normal person) and doing the climb (like a crazy adventurous person) is like the difference between seeing a nice juicy orange from a distance and taking a big bite of the orange and letting the juice run down your face. It's expensive because the whole event is run very well. It is well organized, staffed generously, and provides you with good equipment and enough basic training to make you stay safe. My climbing guide, Chris, was excellent. He got to know everyone in his group, elicited conversation amongst the group members, and provided us with a lot of information on the history of the harbor and bridge. He was even funny, a bonus attribute of good guides everywhere. Worth it? Yes!!!"

It's really interesting to see the continuous flow of traffic and the ferries dashing about the harbour. Terrific views of the harbour, of course, as well as the Opera House. You can only see that side of the Harbour but it well worth the effort. There are a few steps to reach the walkway from the Rocks but easy enough. It can be quite hot if sunny so sunscreen, a hat and water are essential. We stopped and looked and took photos so it took us about an hour for the return trip. We were too early but the Pylon Lookout is recommended and opens at 10.00.We marvelled at the design and construction of the bridge, quite a feat all those years ago."

It was absolutely breathtaking and made me appreciate the bridge so much more! Romeo was an awesome leader with great knowledge and a good sense of humour! My only constructive criticism- Prior to our arrival there was a storm and we weren't 100% sure whether or not it would be called off. I called and was advised that it was up to me whether to risk doing it in the storm or they were happy to re-schedule. I explained we are only in Sydney for one more day and because it landed on a Saturday the lady advised me it would cost an extra $50 for us. I think that in those sort of circumstances they shouldn't bother asking for extra money. We decided to stick to our original booking! Luckily for us the weather turned for the better! Overall an awesome experience and highly recommended!"

If you are on a budget, the government-owned pylon lookout (only $13/adult) it the best way to get a similar experience to the commercially-owned bridge climb (from $158 to $353/adult) - The pylon lookout is between 1/10th and 1/20th of the price. The pylon lookout is not heavily advertised simply because it is not a big commercial money-spinner. It is almost as high as the bridge, so the views are great. You can take your own camera and linger as long as you want, which you cannot do on the bridge climb. Google 'website: Sydney Harbour Bridge pylon lookout' and it will give you all the details.I won't repeat what everybody else has said .... look through Tripadvisor section entitled: \"Pylon Lookout at Sydney Harbour Bridge\".

The hardest part for my wife was transitioning from the cat walk to the bridge. You have to climb a steep, somewhat confined ladder. She almost gave up but pushed through and was glad she did, the climb was awesome. The staff were very helpful and encouraging to help her overcome the fear. My fear was climbing up the bridge itself with openings beneath the steps. After starting the walk, it was clear my fear was for nothing. The area beneath the steps was solid and you could not see the ground/water below you. Our guide was great, taking lots of photos and answering our questions. We took several breaks along the way. They have a great operation and almost anyone can and should take this tour. I suggest the twilight tour as you get to see Sydney by day and then the lights of the city come on as you make the trip down. Beautiful!"

You can walk here, just get off at Wynyard station then walk in the direction of the Rocks, the bridge will be on left side of George Street behind the Glenmore Pub. As a local of Sydney, it took me 31 years to climb the bridge and witness the spectacular views of Sydney harbour for myself - I think you always tend to explore elsewhere before your own backyard. Although doing the bridge climb is VERY expensive compared with entry fees to ancient sights all across Europe, I still feel it's a must do as the panorama is unparalleled anywhere else in Sydney. The guide we had was a Sydney local and very knowledgeable for its history. Tip: Definitely stop at the Glenmore afterwards for a schooner!"

Our guide, Helen, was so entertaining that we forgot to be worried and just relaxed and had a great climb.The company that runs the tours could not be better about worrying about your safety and comfort, so no need for you to do so. They give you everything you need and actually give you some hands on training for climbing the short ladder portion of the climb so you know what to expect before you get there. Helen explained that the lower portion is a little scarier than the upper portion because you are looking down at that point and she was right. Once you get out on the arches you don't see straight down anymore.Helen took us up in short spurts and then you get quite a bit of time up on the very top of the bridge for pictures and looking around. You cross over the middle and go back down the other side. The gear they provide is all first rate and you are attached to the bridge through a safety line from the moment you step out on the bridge until you get back down, no exceptions.You cannot take anything with you that they don't supply so you don't accidentally drop something on someone down below, so expect to pay for some pictures. We took a few and did't mind paying a few dollars extra for them. This was a highlight of our trip and we would recommend you give it a go, you won't be sorry."

Construction commenced in 1924 and it was officially opened in 1932. The bridge now carries a huge amount of traffic (I think it has around 8 lanes of traffic and trains going across it daily). You can walk it for free (toll southwards for cars) or, since the late 1990s, you can climb it for a fee. There is a similar style bridge in Newcastle (England). The steel arch bridge in Newcastle England is a smaller version of this one, although that version doesn't have the stunning Sydney Harbour as its backdrop. This is one view of Sydney that I never get tired of. Most Australians know this, but an interesting fact is that Paul Hogan (Crocodile Dundee) once worked as a permanent bridge re-painter worker for the Sydney Harbour Bridge i.e. once the workers repainted the bridge, they turned around and started again on a permanent basis. (Not sure whether that happens anymore). File that one away for your trivia night knowledge."

There are several ways to \"take in the Bridge experience\": walk halfway across, walk all the way across, climb to to the top of one of the Bridge's pylons, or walk up to the top of the highest span. We did the first and was enjoyable to view the harbor from a different perspective--of course, we had great weather. Otherwise we would have chosen not to seek \"another view.\" Walking all the way across does not add anything except exercise. Going up the pylon was not worth the price; the price ($200/each) to be strapped into a harness, to hold for dear life in the prevailing winds and hike to the very top span was outrageous. If you have a free couple of hours, take in the view--from halfway across."

Start at Kirribilli with brekkie or lunch at one of the fab cafes/restaurants - I'll add reviews for some of these too - then climb the steps to access the most stunning views of the harbour and of course the Opera House. A fave time of year is, of course, the Vivid Festival, when the harbour, buildings and ferries are brightly lit in vibrant colours. A photographer's dream! You can also go up the elevator of the column but this costs $$s - I've never done. If you're a cyclist you can access the cycle path at the other side of the bridge (North Sydney side - turn right then left out of Milson's Point railway station). Of course there's the Bridge Climb too - they are at the city side of the bridge if you want to organise."

I have been on the bridge a few times, both the \"usual\" walk and the one on the middle levelThe conventional one is so informative and fun for all ages. I am not a big fan of heights but there are only a couple of places than can be scary. For these just dont look down. The climb is so safe and informative, the best way to see and find out about our city, for Sydney-siders and visitors alikeThe \"inner\" walk is different, and probably more architectural as you see all the cross supports as wellJust do it, you will have a ball"

In addition, it involved booking a certain time, donning gears etc. And you could only stop at a few occasions to take pics and enjoy the view for only a short while. Instead, we discovered that there is a sidewalk crossing the bridge only a few dozen yards below the expensive option. We took our time stopped as often as we wanted. Climbed up to one of the pillars that housed a museum about the history of construction of the bridge. We walked just before sunset and captured magnificent photos of the Opera House and the Circular Quay and the Sydney Harbour and the Skyline. Our return walk -again free- was after sunset and then we enjoyed the view of the lights and again the Opera House in a tottallty different setting and captured memorable pictures...What an experience! and saved over $500 too!"

Yes, you can pay a lot of money to climb it, and that's fun too, but there's something great about a nice long stroll across the harbour, particularly if you head out just as the sun is setting (or for the really keen, rising).Don't worry too much about trying to choose a time when there's less traffic.

Cross again on the normal bridge where you have photos, and then cross back again using a logged slim bridge with gaps in the double railings again utterly terrifying! The way back down is a delight but the way up I found a real challenge.I would recommend it to friends and family but would discourage anyone with any fear of heights as it is rather challenging!"

To be honest the Sydney Harbor Bridge Pylon Lookout offers nearly as good a view of the city as does the bridge climb and the cost is appreciably lower. But the bridge climb is a much different experience and I\u2019d recommend a properly timed dusk tour to get both the daylight and evening views of the lighted city. We were lucky enough to witness a warm sunset and a nearly simultaneous full moon rise. If you purchase a bridge climb it will include the Pylon Lookout pass but the pylon is only open from 10AM to 5PM. Go to the bridge climb office early to get this pass well before your scheduled climb. Within the pylon is a modest set of photos and discussion of the bridge and its construction which serves as good background before the climb.Now about that bridge climb: If you want a day and night view then check the web for the sunset of the day you hope to climb. Because it takes 50 minutes to prepare a group and because the climb takes some time you should then pick a tour with a starting time about 1.5 hours earlier. Really? Yes? That will put you well up onto the bridge at sunset. In order to insure the safety of the climbers and motorists below, you are very carefully coached and garbed. They did not just think this up and every detail is engineered. You will begin by removing all but your basic clothing and a back zipping jumpsuit is provided. Next comes a robust safety belt with an attached glide that will secure you to the bridge for the entire climb. It follows you along a permanent cable on the bridge and you cannot detach. Eyewear is secured with a strap and a coat, gloves, and hat are provided as needed\u2026all with lanyards to connect to the suit. There are literally no loose ends. Now fitted with a radio headset you will take a short trip over a demonstration set of ladders to give you a feel for the climb and the behavior off the glide restraint. The climbing guides work like a team to orchestrate and oversee your movement and safety. You will clip in as you step out of the preparation building and onto the bridge and you will unclip upon return. I won\u2019t provide any additional detail because it is to be an adventure.We are in our early sixties and it was not particularly taxing. Your tour will stop several times for group and individual photos so be sure that you are clipped in adjacent to your buddies. One group photo was provided at no cost along with a hat and completion certificate at the end of the climb and other photos can be purchased. I did not ask about electronic copies.So in summary the experience was unique and I\u2019d recommend it over the Sydney Tower Skywalk, particularly if you are on a budget. But then it is rather pricey and requires a three hour window. Be sure to eat and purge before you begin to avoid distractions."

It's $250 AUD to do the climb, or free to walk across. However, I do recommend if you choose to walk go up into the Pylon lookout. It does cost approximately $20 AUD to walk to the top and look out at great views of Sydney Harbor. But it is well worth it. I have nothing against the bridge climb other than I didn't believe the experience was worth the money they were asking."

This trip is my top Sydney trip as it only cost 12 dollars to enter rather than the 200 plus it cost for the bridge walk."

A nice option afterwards is to go to the pub and have an ale \u2013 my companions did that, while I persisted with my water.

You can walk across it though, and one of the best places to get a picture is on the North side of the bridge, heading down towards Luna Park, you can get a great picture of the Opera House under the bridge.Also an essential place to be if your lucky enough to be in Sydney for New Years Eve!!"

We were determined to fight jetlag by continuing to move about town and not settle into the room. This was just jaw droppingly awesome. The tour guides are really nice and knowledgable. The climb is not overly intimidating--they go out of their way to keep you safe...and to help you overcome anxiety--the climb is broken up into various starts and stops so you don't get too tired along the way. But lets be clear...it is not a constantly steep climb although there are some steep ladders, but it is a rather long climb---you won't work much harder in the actual climb than you do in the prep session---for those afraid of heights---trust the tripadvsior on this one...DON'T PASS ON THE BRIDGE CLIMB.

It also goes without saying that the $258 price-tag is outrageous. I must say that the company really has this operation down to a science. Every possible part of the climb is fine-tuned down to the smallest detail. From the pre-climb speech, to the donning of gear (suit, harness, hat, sunglass straps, towel, headset), to the practice climb, to the actual climb, to the photos on the bridge, to the removal of gear, to hand washing- they have everything perfected. This company is very safety conscious and I can assure you that you always feel safe. There is a harness on your belt that is always connected to a side rail on the bridge, so there is literally no way you can fall off. You are not allowed to bring anything with you on the bridge (other than sunglasses or meds), but they give you a locker to store things in. You wear a headset so you can hear the guide giving a talk on the history of the bridge while you climb. It is not strenuous at all. I was surprised to find that there were water fountains present on several parts of the bridge (~4). I can say that this climb may be difficult for tall people because several parts of the bridge that are not 'outside' (rather underneath the steel) are relatively short. I am 5'11 and I had to duck for several parts. Luckily the very short parts have styrofoam covering the steel such that even if you hit your head, it will not be so bad. They take 2 pics of you at the top with a point-and shoot camera that you can buy at the end. We bought 1 photo which cost 18.95. (needless to say you cannot bring your camera with you).While on the bridge I learned a very important fact-you can climb one of the bridge pylons (one of the two closer to 'The Rocks' neighborhood) and get a view that is about as high as the bridge for a mere 15 AUD. You heard right-you can enter the pylon on the street level, climb to the top (about 10min or less climb) and you ONLY HAVE TO PAY AUD 15. Of course they don't tell you this ahead of time. This cost is included in the bridge climb ticket if you elect to climb the bridge. We did climb the pylon the following day and found the views to be great and it was not very crowded. Thus, if you want comparable views to the harbor bridge, but don't want to spend 258 AUD, then just climb the pylon.Overall it was a cool experience, but the cost prevents me from giving it 5 stars."

The climb was not physically intensive and anyone that can walk a decent way can make the climb. The only reason that I gave it a three star and not a five star is the fact you can not take anything with you. They made me remove my fitbit and would not let me take my GoPro. It is a bit of a downer to know that they do it just so you have to buy photos at the end.

My main concerns were how strenuous would it be, would I be too warm or too cold and would I suddenly develop a fear of heights? I needn\u2019t have worried. The whole experience takes about three hours but the actual time on the bridge is much less and the actual time spent in \u201cclimbing\u201d is less again. There\u2019s lots of time to admire the views, listen to the informed commentary and to have the inevitable photos taken by your tour guide (personal cameras not allowed). The experience was exhilarating and a real sense of achievement. The day I climbed it, the sky was overcast and the temperature perfect i.e.not too hot but even it had been, there\u2019s water fountains at various intervals and a cooling mist spray at the top. I loved being at the top, feeling the wind in my face and looking over to the iconic Opera House. Only disappointment was the poor quality of the commemorative \u201cfree\u201d photograph. A few seconds of editing could have brightened this and provided a more memorable souvenir. But I do have the hat! Would definitely recommend it."

The tour and climb are timed to military precision and is extremely well organised. Our guide Peter was amazingly friendly, very informative, knowledgable, charming and amusing at times. The climb itself scared the life out of us to say the least and we were shaking a lot of the way through it! Our legs very often turned to jelly! But the thrill of completing the climb is very much worth the cost and the fear! The views of the summit are amazing! You are well looked after and supported the whole time. Great photo opportunities at several points. You are not allowed cameras up there but your guide will take some great photos of you and your friends and tour group to purchase after.It was the most scariest yet thrilling experience!

Firstly you are shown into a room where you remove extra clothing like jackets, bags etc, and lock them into lockers. You are given a cover-all jump suit to put on over your clothes. This makes sure that nothing flaps around up there if it is windy, and protects your clothing. Then you are given information about what the process will be, and taken into a training room, which simulates the climb, including practice climbing the ladders, steps and general information on how you are connected to the Bridge at all times by a very strong clip. Depending on the time of day (there are climbs all through the day and night) you may be given a headlamp too! Then, when everyone feels safe and ready to climb you are led out to begin. It is so exhilarating! You feel extremely safe at all times, but nonetheless, you are climbing an amazing iconic bridge and it is hard to keep the smile from your face. My husband and I were surprised at how easy this climb was. The walkway up to the top of the bridge does not seem steep at all, and is quite wide. You are secure at all times and always in the company of your guide. The guide will boggle your mind with information about what you are seeing, what you are doing, but one thing that stuck with both of us, was that we felt unhurried and as if we had a lot of time to spend up here on the top of the world. We were given plenty of time to soak up the view from the top, and then laughed and exclaimed our way back down to our lockers where we shed our outfits and prepared to go home. A very professional and worthwhile few hours."

Walking on the eastern side gives a fantastic view of the Harbour and Opera House. You can go up the pylon for $13 for a even better view. Catching the train always makes the journey better and crossing by car, when not stuck in traffic, is great too. However to complete your crossing you should take your bike on the western walkway. Great views of the western harbour and Luna Park. Yes I love the bridge.Wandering around the base of the bridge is easy if you pick your times and again has great views. I suggest going to Milson's point after 7PM as the area is quiet and usually easy to park at.If you have the cash then the Bridge Walk is fun, but expensive.Blackmores Running Festival and Spring Cycle are other ways to cross the bridge as well as Seven Bridges Walk."

Entry onto the platform on the Sydney side is via the steps to the east, near the Rocks, which is an easy walk from Circular Quay. On the northern side, the steps are near Milsons Point railway station. On that side, you can go under the bridge to Luna Park to the west and take a leisurely stroll along the harbour foreshore to Wendy's Garden, another close by landmark. There are many cafes and restaurants nearby on both sides.The walk across the bridge will give you many photo opportunities, particularly of the Opera House, Fort Dennison and the Quay with constant boat and ship activity."

There is a famous story about how a disgruntled army cavalier, De-Groot, high-jacked the opening ceremony by riding in and cutting the ribbon as a protest, before being carted off to a mental asylum.The Bridge is the worlds tallest single span steel bridge, and sixth longest, and connects Millers Point to the south and Milsons Point to the north. This bridge was inspired by New York's Hell's Gate Bridge.The Bridge has made its global fame by being the launching point of Sydney's famous New Year's Eve fireworks. You can walk over the bridge, and sometimes it is closed down on special occasions for people to walk on the roadways. A fun thing that people like to do is the climb to the top of the bridge. This is safe and well guided.A favourite vantage point for photographs is lady Macquarie's Chair near Sydney's Art Gallery. This vantage point lets the photographer include both the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge in the same shot."

She puts you at ease with her banter and informative chatting the whole time. I would recommend this to EVERYONE! We were even standing around chatting on the top of the Bridge and I didn't feel scared for an instant. The views are to die for.

We climbed to the top and it was amazing, the view of the harbour, the history of the Sydney bridge, everything was great!The company is very professional, they will educate and instruct every climber properly before the tour, you will need to change into the suit and put on the equipment, so I would suggest to go with shorts and casual outfit with a pair of comfortable walking shoes (no flip-flops or sandals) The whole tour is about 1.5 - 2 hours, including the preview and preparation. Your bags, accessories, everything will be stored in the lockers including cameras. They will take photos for you in 3 different spots on the bridge and you can purchase them after the tour. The tour is quite safe and fun, the climbing is not very tiring or difficult so I think as long as you can walk and is not afraid of height, every age group could go.I'm glad that I went and I enjoyed a lot!"

One of the world's most iconic structures, but imagine my British delight to discover it was designed by an English engineering company based in Middlesborough, as an expanded version of the bridge in Newcastle (UK). Like many I had hoped to take the escorted view across the bridge, but at almost AUS$200 each I thought that was a rip-off. Instead, for around AUS$10 we climbed up one of the towers and got an even more amazing view as it is much higher at its summit. There's also a small interesting exhibition illustrating the history of the bridge and its construction. Walking over the bridge as a normal pedestrian, we took in the delights of the 1950's style NY Coney Island funfair and awesome views across the bay, especially at night when all the skyscrapers are lit up."

The Sydney harbour bridge was built during the \"Great Depression\" and gave many Australian families sustenance during a period of worldwide deprivation. It was finished in 1932 and at that time (and possibly still may be) was the world's larges single span bridge. A very popular, though not cheap, tourist attraction is the \"Bridge Walk\" over the top of the bridge, affording, I imagine, spectacular views of the most beautiful harbour in the world. Advance bookings are required and some popular tour times are very difficult to arrange and poor weather can disrupt best laid plans. For those of us with limited financial resources there is an alternative and it's FREE. Albeit not as spectacular, but available, without pre-booking, 24/7. There is a delightful walkway on the east side of the bridge. Furthermore, unlike the \"Bridge climb\" which, due to safety requirements precludes using cameras, you can snap to your hearts content iconic harbour features such as, the Opera house, Fort Denison, The Rocks and Sydney Skyline. Add a telephoto lens and the entire harbour is there. You can walk either way, City to Milsons Point, or catch a train to Milsons Point and walk back to Sydney (or catch a ferry if you're fit and don't mind an uphill walk from the jetty to the bridge or do the less tiring reverse trip). I've enjoyed this walk many times and never fail to finish with a smile on my dial."

The trek started in one of the bridge tower and from there our guide would tell more than two hours of stories about the harbour bridge. Ive never seen a bridge with so many stories in its history.The trek was really wonderful and the views around was really fantastic. The walk was slow and safe (many safety features). The stories along the way made the climb even more interesting. Curiously, there were many drinking fountains along the catwalk. By the time you're halfway through, you'll definitely want to try to take a drink. I guess the most thrilling part is when you have to climb a series of stairs and ladders. Its really steep and sometimes a train would pass by and the noise would just rattle your brains out.When you reach the arch, everything starts to slow down. The view is spectacular and you would like to stay there for as long as you can. The experience at the top of the bridge is priceless. The views cannot be explained in writing. You'll want to have a cup of coffee or tea once you reach it. :)"

We timed our climb for 4.30 during the Vivid festival, and were entertained by Julia and Angus Stone playing in the Opera House Forecourt, a display of Chinese warriors and a rousing sing along at the pub on our way out, such great memories to share with my kids.

I did find that the price this time had gone up considerably compared to only two years ago. The price is starting to become a bit high for what you get.

Very pleasant walk with great view of the harbor and the Opera House, although the fully enclosed 'cage' (understandably for safety reason) makes taking picture a bit tricky. No matter, it is just as enjoyable. After crossing the bridge, we took the stairs and went down to the little park under the bridge. We saw two groups of 'bridge climbers' (looked like ants from the distance) on the bridge and took some good close-up pictures of them. A very relaxing afternoon strolling the shore and enjoy the magnificent view of the harbor, the bridge, the Opera House and downtown Sydney. And adding that, it is totally free. Don't miss it!"

Safety is paramount at all times, and everything you have to wear or carry is checked thoroughly. There is also a test ladder to have a quick practice on how to ascend and descend the steps. Our guide was great and was informative and funny, we had loads of photos taken to really which is a great way to look back on a spectacular event.

The walk is safe as there is a dedicated walkway for pedestrians. Take water, hat and sunscreen. You may find it windy as well. You can always buy the \"Bridge Climb\" packages which walk along the arch of the bridge.

The guide was informative and amusing the views were spectacular. You get a group photo, certificate and hat to keep. We pre booked the option of a couple of family photos which saved a bit. The ticket also includes entry to one of the pylons and is valid for a month.

If you are visiting Sydney, physically able, and without a fear of heights, climbing the Harbour Bridge should be at the top of your list! This was an absolutely wonderful experience affording you a view of the beautiful city and the Opera House unlike any other you can get. Our guide, Jessica, was kind and knowledgeable, and I know that with her guidance at least two on our tour (14 per group) were able to make the climb even with a fear. Safety was of the utmost concern and we all were breathalyzed before and tethered to safety cables via our provided suits. All gear is available to give you the best experience; a strong gust of wind and a brief shower happened during our tour but the fleece and the rain gear - all attached to the belt - made it tolerable if a little more thrilling than anticipated. You have to be able to follow instructions, to be able to properly climb the ladders and stairs, and you have to be prepared to wait a number of times. And for safety reasons you can't bring your own camera, cell phone, or GoPro. The only criticism I had is that at times we had to wait for other tours. This was also fortunate as it gave us a chance to rest a bit! Even though I am in great shape I could feel the next day that my calves were challenged. This is a 'you only live once' bucket list item. I'm glad I checked it off while in Sydney!"

A nice walk and great views of the Harbour."

Real commuters wont appreciate tourists stopping and blocking the way to take photos, but if you keep to the very edge so people can zoom past they will forgive you. The walking path is on the East side which is also delightful this is where you can get some semi birds-eye views of the opera house and circular quay. I've never done the bridge climb, which i'm sure is great, but this is the quick and cheap alternative."

This bridge can be walked, cycled, cross by a train or a car. You can even climb, if you wish. Surely, there is no singe piece of infrastructure that has better served Sydney that this bridge.

There is some times when you have to climb fairly vertical stairways and climb/walk on surfaces where you can see through and that can give you a strange feeling. Getting past all that, it is a great sight when you get to the top and you feel really great that you have done it. It can get breezy up there but you are supplied with jackets so its not a problem.

The experience is fun as you get kitted out and set off in anticipation of an adventure. A lot of the time is spent concentrating on the climbing of stairs and gangways, safety line constantly attached. But when you get to look around the views are awesome - best of all from the very top. The city and harbour are laid out before you - simply unforgettable. I went on the Night Climb which in March starts around dusk and I thought the views at night were probably tops. One of the best things I have done to date! Unmissable (though quite pricey)."

Easy cheap way to start your walk so you walk looking at the Harbour...and likely heading back toward The Rocks, the Circular Quay, the Opera House or your hotel. Fascinating to look at bridge structure. Plenty of security screening if worried about safety, And a fabulous view of the harbor. Highly recommended."

Its size is truely immense as it spans the north and south side of Sydney. You can walk across it, the entrance is just up from the Rocks area, you can climb over it, you can drive across it, travel across on a train, and even sail underneath it. Its a fantastic backdrop to an amazing skyline."

The experience was awesome, the staff were just so supportive and helpful. Carol is afraid of heights, but with the support of the staff and the reassuring safety measures we managed the climb easily. The views are incredible and cannot be matched from anywhere else in Sydney. Whilst it took us about 3 or 4 hours it wasn't too strenuous, more a stiff walk than a climb really. Would recommend it to anyone fit enough to walk round a shopping precinct. If your in Sydney it is a must do..."

We didn't try the pylon or try going up the walkway - it certainly is not for the faint hearted.But the views of the bridge are unbeatable - its like watching a cinemascope supersized beyond IMAX.

You can also add in a trip up the pylon (a charge applies) hosting the story of the bridge and a viewing gallery at the top (approx. half the height from the bridge deck of the overall bridge height).

I had on gym pants and a singlet as it wasn't cold, so with the suit over the top I was a good temperature. Then we had to climb some stairs and do some safety training. Which is good, because that bridge is pretty high.Harnessed, suited and terrified we began. The guide was fantastic - educated, humourous and put me at ease really quickly. There was one scary part - the beginning. Once you get used to the noise of the traffic you get lost in the view.

For $13 AUD, you get to go up the Pylon and get a great view of the bridge, the Sydney Opera House, and the high rises of Sydney."

We took the free bus (555) to the harbour and walked around to view the bridge and Opera house as well as the botanical gardens. Worth a look and a photo opportunity but most things related to the bridge are expensive (ie climbing it) so recommend just taking out half a day and walking around the different vantage points for photo opportunities.

I prebooked this bridge climb just a few days before after I had checked the weather forecast, you don't want to be doing this in the rain. The bridge itself is impressive and the bridge walk is not for those with a fear of heights. There are open catwalks to negotiate before actually starting on the arch climbing bit which has a solid floor. (Except for a couple of cross members you have to go over) The views are stunning and it's well worth the trip. The staff are friendly and helpful and you are looked after very well in terms of your safety and the kit you are given to use. The only downside to this trip is that I feel it is very very expensive at about $850 for three adults and a picture package !!! Yikes. But if you are only every going to do this once, then I guess you just have to do it. There is only one company offering this trip so you can't shop around for prices."

Then we walked back across when it was dark. We were there during Vivid so the lights were amazing. But the views are great anyways. I'm not sure why people pay to go up in the tower. We did not and I see no reason to go higher. And I can't for the life of me figure out why people pay $250+ to climb to the top of the bridge and cameras aren't allowed for that tour. We didn't think there was any reason to go higher than the street level and along the walking path and we are very happy with our decision.

We did the 3pm one so when we were coming back down the sun was starting to set which was nice. It takes about 3 hours in total and at least 2 hours of that was spent on the bridge. You get plenty of time to enjoy the experience and take in the views which was great. The views were fantastic! It's not a difficult walk, I thought it would be but it's all gradual steps so it's fine. It's not scary either unless you have a serious fear of heights you're fine. Our group only had 6 people which was brilliant but the guide said there are usually about 16. Our guide was brilliant, really informative, interesting, good fun and easy to listen to. You get a cap to keep afterwards, a group photo and a ticket for the pylon lookout which also gives great views. I really enjoyed the bridge climb, it was even better than I expected. What I loved most was the amount of time given on the bridge to just look around and enjoy it without being pushed on or hurried."

It links the north with the south, spanning one of the most beautiful harbours in the world. But not just something to look at, it can be walked, climbed, driven over, sailed under, at it's base in the Rocks you can eat within its shadow.

Before the climb we got to practice doing everything in a big room with practice stairs for climbing up and down, practice bars to attach the buckle on and headphones so that you can hear the instructor. We went on the climb at sunset and other than the fact i should have worn more clothes (it was really cold) it was the most beautiful view i've every seen!! totally recommend it foe everyone who likes long walks above a bridge!"

The guides are friendly, enthusiastic and full of knowledge about the bridge. It was fun to learn all about the bridge, it's history, it's stats, all while taking in the unique views of Sydney Harbour. The weather in Sydney was not good while we were there.

It's a fair bit of walking to get through the rocks and onto the bridge but it's well worth it. Every time I go to Sydney heading to the bridge is on my list. Fun fact - you can climb the pylon and get a great 360 degree view of the entire harbor (as well as learn a little about the bridge construction). It's good to do because it costs $13 AUS and most tourists don't want to pay to climb up there so there aren't really crowds trying to get their photo of the opera house from the bridge's walkway. Lots of steps but well worth it for the views ( without paying a few hundred $ to do the bridge climb)."

They of course will take your picture with the Opera House and Circular Quay in the background to sell you when you get back down but 14 years later these pics still occupy a prominent place at my desk! If you are healthy and adventurous this is a must see and do!"

Our family of four (two teenagers) arrived at 9:50 to meet up with others to form a group of about 12 people with one guide for the Bridge Climb. It took nearly an hour to go through safety briefings and get suited up, with all gear securely attached so that nothing could fall from the bridge. Everyone is clipped in to a safety cable that runs the full trip to the top and back. The trip is not strenuous (my fitbit said an elevation gain of 80 flights of stairs over maybe 1.5 miles? ... I can't quite remember) and the climb was slow with lots of narration by the FABULOUS guide who described the history of the bridge as we walked. The climb was not at all scary -- the most difficult parts being coming down two ladder climbs of about 100 steps each with lots of handrails and landings. The rest of the climb was very mellow, with great views of the city. It was also fun to see the underside of the bridge. We bought the photo package and are glad we did, but I really wish I could have brought my camera and spent some time taking photos of the underside of the bridge itself."

It allows access to all three forms of Public Transportation, Bus, Ferry and Trains. You tap on and off and the fare is deducted from the preloaded card, the maximum cost per day is $15, on Sunday $2.50, it's the best bargain in the City with a fantastic public transportation system. If you use a taxi, be sure and ask the driver for a fare estimate to your destination. From the Circular Quay to our B&B, we paid anywhere from $6.20 to $17.40. The meters run constantly, so rush hour can make a difference, but some drivers like to take the long way about, so be sure to get an estimate before you ride."

However when we arrived and tried to book it we found that it was going to cost $516!!! You can't take anything with you either. Not having your own camera defeats the purpose. They just want to sell you their pictures. VERY disappointing!"

When you get to the Pylon climb the stairs and view the history of the bridge, then come out on top and marvel at the view."

We chose a hot and sunny day in January and opted for the express version. This involved climbing below the upper span which we both felt offered a greater feeling of scale as, apart from the final few minutes we were enveloped in the structure. The guide was informative and ensured we had a potted history of the construction, statistics and history. It is not particularly strenuous and fine for any relatively active person. The only downside is the cost and which we did not feel represented value for the money. The express option lasted about three hours and would be our recommendation as even this is anything but 'express'."

Although it is expensive, it is worth the experience! The group is limited to about 15, and there are numerous photo stops as you climb. The climb is more like walking along a path, except for a few ladders at the very beginning and at the end of the descent.I only wish that I could have taken my own camera up, but that is not allowed. You can't even wear a wristwatch! Our guide was great, and we had a fun time as we climbed, enjoying the view. I did buy a couple of extra photos, because, after all, I wanted the proof that I was at the top!"

Yes it could be viewed as expensive but it is a 3hr tour.Dan our guide was enthusiastic and easy to chat to very knowledgeable.We arrived 15mins before our walk time of 11am. I was nervous....not because of heights but going 3hrs without a loo break!I had limited liquids prior to the walk so all ok.We filled in a health questionnaire and then were presented with the standard blue/grey boiler suit to change into. The staff member was excellent and instinctively knew peoples sizes....he didnt get anybody in our group wrong....brilliant for those who may be self conscious.This is the last opportunity for toilet stop....i took advantage!We were then briefed on how we were attached to bridge and practised with the slider device and kitted out with radios to hear our guide, fleeces in case it was cold and an equipment belt to hold all the gear.We then practised climbing a demo ladder set up to check our comfort levels and ensure health & safety was observed at all times.Prior to climb we had a breath test...similar to police test.Then we were off. It took some getting used to traffic flow underneath us and the occasional train. Weather was perfect no wind! Climbing the ladders was scary but there is another guide their to assist...slow and steady the best method.Dan paced the walk well and took photos of the group and individually along the way as you cant take anything on the climb. No bracelets or watches either....small earrings ladies.The time went so quickly and then we were on our way back down. Dan got the group to sing happy birthday right at the top of the bridge to my daughter, she was embarrassed but I thought it was a nice touch.Would highly recommend. Picture souvenir at the end great reminder of a fantastic day plus a certificate to prove we did it! Loved it"

You'll see a lot of runners/joggers and people going to and from work. I did see that you can go up the pylon for $13. I didn't do it because it wasn't open when I was there but wished I could have. I guess you could spend a lot more to climb the top of the bridge, but if you want to save some money, just use the free pedestrian walk."

On my last visit, January '15, I did the next best thing and walked the road bridge \"there and back\". To get to the walk way involves a series of steps which I accessed from (Cumberland St.?) area near the Glenmore and Australia Hotels (another story). Once up the walk was level and spacious with a few fellow walkers, some joggers and a few Securiy/Safety officials. These officials were also very helpful with general information. There was a nice breeze, on an otherwise sweltering day, and the views were great. You can see all the main structures and destinations all the way out to the Heads (?). You get a great idea of what a busy waterway the harbour is. On that day there was constant waterborne activity. Ferries (many), water taxis, ditto, a massive Cruise Ship, War Ships (2), dozens of assorted Yachts with multicoloured sails, assorted Motor Cruisers and barely visible, some Kayaks. I am not qualified to describe the Bridge other than to say it is massive and multifunctional. Having got to ground level on the far side I had lunch in a small cafe and returned. On other days I was on the harbour in various craft which gave another aspect of this amazing structure."

            "review": "Excellent exercise plus excellent views with many 'side' options. The Sydney Harbour Bridge was the iconic symbol of Sydney even before its official opening on March 19, 1932. For its time its scale was massive and, even today, carrying eight lanes of road traffic plus two parallel railway tracks it provides a vital link between the City and the North Shore.The pedestrian walkway is on the Eastern side of the Bridge with a dedicated cycleway on the opposite side so that cyclists and pedestrians don't mix. The walkway is wide enough for four people to walk abreast and the railings have gaps suitable for positioning the largest camera lens for spectacular shots of the Sydney Opera House and the City skyline as well as the apartments that come right to the edge of the northern shoreline.The Pylon Lookout is a must visit for first timers (there is an admission charge) with lots of information about the building of the Bridge as well as a an elevated vantage point for a more panoramic view of the surroundings. Bridgeclimb is also a separate attraction that is very popular, but this review is just for the totally free of charge and recopmmended walk across the bridge to enjoy the view. On a windy day it can be quite cold so take that into account in your planning.From the steps at the southern end to the steps at the northern end took us a very leisurely 40 minutes but it can be done in half that time if you just want a brisk walk. I recommend you take the extra time to enjoy the views and don't forget to admire the engineering above you and roadside too - most people are so busy looking outward they miss much of the impressive elements of this structure, which has been awarded heritage status by the International Society of Engineers."

We were not disappointed.The bridge is organized very well. Cars and trains in the middle, cyclists on the Western side, and pedestrians on the Eastern side. So you can walk the bridge at your own pace. It's almost impossible to do the walk quickly because we were frequently distracted by the incredible views of CBD. A must do!"

Unfortunately a storm popped up when we reached the external part of the climb and had to take cover underneath the bridge. Due to timing of our flight we had to ask for a refund. This process was handled very poorly. Since we were unable to make the full climb we asked for the one picture we got on the outside of the bridge and they told us it was their policy that they wouldnt provide it even though they brought the camera down with us. Finally we convinced them to let us buy the picture. They didnt want to provide us a refund of the climb either. We had to convince them that coming from the states, we wouldn't likely be back to complete the climb and they eventually provided a refund."

I travelled on my own but a few others on the clim were on their own too. I arranged to do a morning climb but it was full so they offered the \"Dusk to Dark climb\". I didn't think I liked the sound of that option, but when they explained it to me, it made sense. You start the climb when its still light, the sun is shining and the view as you are walking up is amazing and clear. You can see for miles and the view is simply breathtaking. By the time you reach the top, the sun is just setting and a few lights are starting to twinkle and everything feels calm and peaceful. By the time you start your desent back down the bridge, its dark and the light show around Sydney is just brilliant. The photographer took everyones pictures while it was still light, then at dusk then when it was dark. So you get 3 fantastic pictures with the 3 settings. On the other time climbs, you just get one backdrop. Day, or Dusk Or Dark! I got all three. The training/health & safety talk beforehand may seem boring to some, but its necessary. The staff were brilliant. They were fun but serious when needed. I felt completely safe with them, and they do a bit of a history lesson about the bridge too. The safety harness system in place helps you feel totally secure. It didn't matter that I was on my own. Everyone was so friendly and chatty. Everyone was happy to share their moment. A young couple from Brisbane got engaged when they reached the top. He arranged it beforehand so that the guide could take the ring for him (as you can't take anything with you) - which added to the lovely atmosphere at the top of the bridge. I was originally going to book a helicopter tour around the harbour, but they wanted to charge me double because I was on my own? But I am glad I did the bridge climb instead. It has to be one of the most amazing things I have ever done and I was on a high for days afterwards. You stand under the bridge the next day and its hard to imagine you were stood on the top!!If you go to Sydney, you MUST do this. You would be mad to miss it."

We had Bronte as our guide and a very small group of 4 (something about the 12.30 climb). Learnt so many interesting facts about the bridge and Sydney itself and the views and indescribable! I was very nervous and not sure if Id actually do it. The beginning is the hardest. You start by walking a 'catwalk' which is kind of walking on a metal mesh that you look at the ground below you, and then you climb the 4 ladders. This is the hardest part (which really isn't hard at all, and not scary). After that the arch is so easy and you forget how high you are and what your doing because its just so amazing. Its surprisingly very peaceful up there after spending the morning in the busy city!A must do! This was my 2nd trip to Sydney, I was so disappointed I didn't do it last time! And now if/when I go back I will do a night time climb!"

It is well worth the effort to find it. The Climb is an adventure you won't soon forget. There are many variations to choose from: shortened climbs, longer climbs on the upper arch, sunrise climbs, sunset climbs, etc. It is easy to buy your tickets on-line, and that way you can get the start time you prefer. You certainly can walk up and buy a ticket, but you might have to wait for a while when it is busy.There is nothing to fear!!!!! The climb itself is not too difficult, and your small group moves at a slow pace. There are a couple of tricky spots where you have to duck, step over a beam, or climb a vertical ladder, but generally you are just walking up a gradual, continuous, well-spaced stairway. This is the most organized, well-run, safety-aware organization you'll encounter. Much of the time at the base is spent on equipment procedures and safety rules. You are given a jumpsuit to wear over your clothes, so dress lightly. There will be a locker for you to store personal items. Depending on the weather you will be offered a fleece, gloves, rain poncho, baseball cap or warmer beanie, and even a cloth handkerchief. All if these items get tethered to your jumpsuit or safety belt. The belt is tethered to the continuous wire which runs the length of your bridge climb, keeping you safe as you climb.Once you get through the paperwork, orientation and suiting-up, your leader will take you out to the bridge. The climb does not take that long, but when you add in all the preparation and time for returning all of the gear, it is about three hours. No cameras are allowed, however, the group leader will shoot video of you and your party, as well as take photos at numerous stops along the way. Fear not, because you exit through the photo sales area, where you have plenty of time to order prints, CDs, and other items. You will get one photo included in your climb price, and there is no pressure to buy additional items.The climb is not inexpensive, and the tickets are not refundable. Once you buy your ticket you must be prepared to climb no matter the weather, but hopefully you will have a glorious day and an unforgettable experience."

My 1st climb was in 1999 and I have seen the prices climb too!! But I still think it is worth it. This time I paid AUD268 each for a daytime climb for 2 of us. And a further AUD50 for the photos and a video on a souvenir USB drive.I say it is worth it because of all the safety measures in place and there is training provided. Except for a short 3 or 4 vertical \"ladder\" type ascent/descent, the remainder of the climb is very gradual. You get great views of Circular Quay/ Opera House, North Shore/ Taronga Zoo, Darling Harbour, the various Bays (to the east) up to the last (Watsons Bay) and views of the west too. And you get trains passing by (above and below you, depending on the timing).Of course, you get better views from the twice as high Sydney Tower, but this is the Coat Hanger (local name for the Sydney Harbour Bridge)."

The climb was easy, not hard at all. There are lots of stops along the way waiting for others, listening to commentary, taking in the views, so didn't feel rushed at all.

I had visited Sydney on business years ago and didn't have time for the bridge climb so I was thrilled to have the opportunity.The bridge itself is an architectural one built it is amazing that it's held up as wonderful as it has. The bridge climb company make sure that safety is of most importance and consequently give an hours worth of briefing as well as making sure that your equipment that they give you is in tiptop shape. We were given jumpsuits, hats, handkerchiefs, radios, raincoats and a practice climb before embarking. The safety briefing was extensive.We were connected to a very thick cable for the duration of the climb up and down the bridge and there is a feeling of total safety as a result. The guide that we had was very thorough and knowledgeable about the history of the bridge I gave lots of interesting color commentary about what is happened and where we were what we were doing. Initially we going to a cat walk that leads to a very large concrete pylons where there were they were letters that went to the top deck of the bridge I imagine those letters total of six stories high going up and going down. The client to the top was really a gradual slope and it was made all the more exciting on our particular trip as a storm and thunder started as we reach the very very top of the bridge. Once we reach the top we traversed about 75 meters across the highway below as well as the train tracks. Upon reaching the other side we started the trip down.All told, the entire adventure took 31/2 hours and was quite memorable.All told the entire adventure was about 3 1/2 hours"

Firstly, you are fitted with suits and then all sorts of attachments to make sure you are totally safe and comfortable. You obviously cannot take anything with you on the climb, like camera or phones etc but you are given a locker to put everything in. The only thing you can take are sunglasses and they are fitted with a strap that is then clipped onto your suit. You are then fitted with headphones and radio so you can here your guide speaking rather than having to pass on what was said to the person at the end of the line. When everything has been checked you then go through a tunnel and your safely line is slid onto a metal railing which you are attached to for the whole climb. If you don't really like heights but determined to do it as I was, the advice I will give you is grin and bear it until you get to the start of the bridge and then you will be fine. The views are fantastic and Richard's stories and facts were brilliant. Richard took lots of photos on the way around. I was worried as I thought you may need to be really fit to do the climb and I was worried I would hold everyone up. But Richard took lots of stops to talk and take photos so it wasn't a problem. It was a fantastic experience and I would totally recommend it."

From the Rocks you can climb up to the pedestrian walkway which runs along harbour side (opposite side is for cycles). From the middle of the bridge there are some wonderful photo opportunities of the Opera House.2. Again, from the Rocks, you can walk under the bridge and find some photo opportunities of the bridge from a very different angle to the 'standard' view from the Opera House. When we visited, this was also a popular spot for photos of newly weds.However you look at it, he bridge is an impressive achievement one of the true iconic structures in the world."

An interesting way is to take the train across the bridge from Wynyard and get off at Milson's Point station, then walk under the bridge and up the steps to get onto the bridge. The walk then finishes in the Rocks area and it's an easy walk down to Circular Quay and around to the Opera House."

I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was, you can pretty much go at your own pace. The guide that we had was awesome really interesting and made the climb even better with all the stories and history about the bridge. The view was amazing especially from the highest point it really is breathtaking! So glad I did it!"

Great city views at a fraction of the price of the Bridge Climb ($13 for adults @ May2015) and you can stay as long as you like - no walking in a queue roped to a guideline. Open 10am to 5pm every day except Christmas day. Downside - 200 or so steps up and no lift. Don't forget to walk over the bridge to North Sydney and pick up a coffee at Milson's Point"

I took the Express Bridge Climb package - a 2 1/2 hour climb, instead of the normal 3 1/2.Was a bit nervous initially, but once I was strapped in, I felt safe and sturdy. The pace for the express climb was just perfect for me, left me just slightly out of breath, which I like.And the view!I took the 3pm tour, and was lucky enough to catch sunset! For free (the usual sunset climb is about AUD100 more expensive)!! GORGEOUS!I would definitely recommend the 3pm Express Bridge Climb tour. And cheers to the ever friendly and informative guide(s)"

I actually did go to the top of one of the pylons, with a free voucher from friends who did the climb, good view there, too, but I am not sure it's worth the $13 or so fee when the deck is so good already. Museum under bridge where you buy tickets is free, too. Explains how, to Austrailia, it's not just a bridge. It was the first man-made object in Australia that was the biggest in the world. Before the bridge, the great engineering works were all elsewhere (UK, France, US, etc.)."

You need to get the base of one of the bridge supports (area know as the Rocks) to have the quest access to either the street walk or girder walk across the bridge From there it was up a LOT of steps to the pedestrian walking path on the bridge across the river. There was an Holland America tour available to walk the bridge structure girders high above the bridge, but that was a little too pricey for us at around ($400 PP) plus (most disappointing) they will not allow you to take a camera on the walk (not even our body attached GO PRO camera) as they say they do not want you to drop anything. Suspect this is just another way of getting a buck out of you for one of the pictures they sell of you on the bridge!Walk the free pedestrian walkway over the bridge for some great pictures of the harbor and opera houseBack off the bridge we wondered around the Rocks area where there was a wonderful, upscale arts and crafts show. This is a more permanent set up than the Queen Victoria Marketplace in Sydney, and a completely different venue of shops."

This allows you to climb up during the sunset and see the city lights as you descend. The climb itself is very easy with a lot of stops for stories and pictures. The most difficult part of the climb is the beginning and the end as you have to navigate 5 sets of metal ladders. Everyone takes their time and it is very safe. You need to pray that your guide is not only a great guide and storyteller, but a good photographer as well. Our guy was great, but new, and a horrible photographer. Hopefully he will get better because those photos are not inexpensive and it's even worse when they are not flattering because the photog doesn't know how to photograph people in a way that flatters them. Having said that, it was still one of my highlights. Do it!!"

You have two options on the Sydney Harbor Bridge: (a) the Sydney Harbor Bridge Climb AUD $200 - $300 (b) walk across the bridge FREE.Take a train from Central, Town Hall or Wynyard stations or a ferry from Circular Quay to Milsons Point. This is the station on the north side of the harbor.You have two options for walking across the bridge (a) West Side - lots of cyclists, skate boarders and you don't get the views of the Opera House (b) my recommendation is to take the East Side path.The walk takes about 20 mins and is very easy, apart from the steps up to the bridge. There a lots of vantage points as you walk across the bridge, to take photos of the beautiful Sydney Harbor, Opera House, The Rocks, Circular Quay.An additional benefit is you can pay AUD $13.00 to climb up the Southern Pylon (the large pillar you see on the south end of the bridge arch). This has a small museum inside but there are 200 steps from the bridge path to the very top BUT IT IS WORTH IT! You get some spectacular views of the birdge, harbor, opera house, and the west side of Sydney Harbor. You can walk right around the pylon so take advantage of the views."

If you are visiting Sydney with tight schedule but want to catch the OPera House and The Bridge you acn do this by catching a train from Airport or any Sydney regional station to the Circular Quay Station which is located halfway between these two attractions with about 15 minute walk to either.The Circular Quay is also a major Ferry Terminal for the Sydney Harbour and you can buy a Day Ticket from automatic machines at train station for around $20 that gives you unlimited travel on Sydney trains, ferries and busses for one day. If you have limited time, catch the train to Circular Quay and as soon as you exit on the Norther side you will see the Bridge on your left and the Opera House on your right.It is an easy walk to the Opera House from where you have a spectacular view of the Bridge and Sydney Harbour. If you have more time you may consider walking over the bridge but this is much more physical and will take at least an hour, but it is reasonably easy walk to go under the bridge just following the water edge from the Opera House.Also consider catching a Ferry to Manly and back (about 2 hour return trip) for a great view of Opera house as you sail past it. A ferry to Luna Park will take you under the Harbour Bridge and and is only about 30 min return trip.If you have a tight time or money budget, these option will get you spectacular scenery in small timeframe for arounf $20."

It's 990 steps and you have to leave your FitBit behind. :( It's very safe and you feel very safe. The pathways are very nice. You first put on the suit, then the belt which has a hook that goes on a cable attached to the bridge. Once it goes on the cable there is no taking it off so you are attached good. They do a breathalyzer test to make sure you are sober also and fill out paperwork. You then get the belt/harness, a kleenex on a wrist band for water eyes?, the hat that is attached to the back of the jumpsuit and also eye glass ties to prevent youfrom loosing them. Now you are ready. Nothing more can go. You do not climb an incline but steps but we did take little breaks when we felt tired. It was a little tough for us old people but we made it and are so proud of it! The photo is just as good as the one at the top. A MUST do if you are in Sydney. Don't miss it!! Also don't miss the photo op at night out on a ferry. It''s simply breath taking!! The view has made me rate this city the #1 city of lights even over Las Vegas."

The grand presence of the bridge in the quay area is amazing. It's seriously a magnificent creation. While having a good walk around the area, if you have a camera handy, you wouldn't stop taking breathtaking beautiful clicks. The view is extra spectacular in the evening when the taller buildings in the periphery, opera house, big boats and the bridge itself shine so beautifully. Come around the New Years evening and you would be able to experience one of the best fire cracker shows in the world. Besides this place being beautiful, it has a lot more to offer. The area has a great vibe, full of world class restaurants serving scrumptious cuisines, pubs & clubs get crowded even on the mid days of the week and weekends are specially maddening with enthusiastic lots, or you would see people generally having a happy stroll around. In short, the place is not to miss if you wanna see one of the best sights of sydney plus top of the range nightlife."

You can walk from the City to Milsons Point and if you are staying in the City you can catch a train back to Wynyard if you don't want to walk all the way back.Climbing the bridge has become very fashionable, but you don't have to. Walking across the bridge is just as good and you can save yourself a couple of hundred dollars.So put your walking shoes on and take a bottle of water and enjoy the walk. It will take about a good 30-40 minutes to walk one way.Enjoy !"

The bridge walk is expensive (approx 110pds) and is not for the faint hearted or those with mobility problems. The view from the top is fantastic. Just imagine how the built the bridge !

However it's not a great walk and most of the time it is difficult to see out through the fencing designed, presumably, to stop you jumping off. There are couple of viewpoints for some good photos.It isn't a very long bridge to walk across and, combined with a ferry one way, it makes an interesting stroll. Note that only the East side path is open to pedestrians, with cyclists confined to the West side. The East side looks towards the Opera House and the sea."

We did the longer tour and found the climb was not difficult - the hardest section was 4 sets of ladders, one after the other. However there are strict rules re; having only one person at a time on a ladder and therefore there is ample time to rest between ladders. In fact you're given many rest and photo opportunities during the gradual move up the bridge, all while being told through audio the interesting history and anecdotes of the bridge. My husband and I are 59 years old, and I have a painful knee and do not like heights - I had no problem at all with the climb and the view was spectacular.

We did one and watched the sunrise from the top of it and it is up there with one of the best things I have ever done. Even just looking at the bridge across the harbour from where the Opera House is, is amazing. It is so expansive and dominating. I would very much recommend doing this if you are ever in Sydney."

Working in Newcastle upon Tyne, I know that the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Tyne Bridge are exact replicas of each other, but the Sydney bridge is about four times as large. It is incredibly impressive viewed from the harbour or on a ferry, but climbing the thing is just awesome! The organisation of the climb is excellent, and every safety measure has been thought of and implemented. All accessories and jewellery have to be taken off and left behind before the climb, and everyone wears a body suit which is tethered to railings. This is not to say that the climb is easy, or that there are not difficult moments for those afraid of heights. The start and the end of the climb involves negotiating vertical stairs and walking along narrow pathways, and I found both challenges. However, most of the climb is more straight forward, with wide walkways and space to move. The views are so spectacular, and our guide was both helpful and informative. The views do not need any further comment, as they are so well known, but I was very interested to hear about the conditions of the men building the bridge, and to see the massive nuts and bolts they used to secure the parts together; literally millions of them, and in the most hazardous conditions. And yet so few accidents and fatalities in the 9 years in took to build the bridge from 1923 to 1932. Astonishing. When you come to Sydney, you don\u2019t have to climb the Bridge to appreciate it. However, in my view, it is worthwhile to pay the money for this trip (and at \u00a3399.78 for three people it isn\u2019t cheap), steeling the nerves if like me you need to, and to climb the Bridge and buy the photos taken by the guide at the end, which I am sure will be treasured mementoes of a fabulous, and unique Sydney experience."

Takes half day and you are exposed to the elements, so plan accordingly. The trip was well paced so 1400 steps were no problem, though we felt them in our calf muscles the next day. They took care of everything, however personal cameras are not allowed as they could be dropped on the people and cars below. Not recommended for those with problems with heights but you don't really feel on the edge at any time."

For the price, we thought these should be included. Our guide was very informative and it is undoubtedly a great experience. However, it started to rain when we were at the top and it got quite cold. As we'd already been up there for a while by that point, we would have liked to descend quicker but the guide kept us up there for a while longer, which we didn't feel was necessary.

There is about and hours prep time before the walk and this is to suit you up and prepare you for the walk. The views are magnificent from the top and your guide will give you a history of the bridge and show you things in the distance such as the Queens Residence and Kirrabilly House for example, he will also take pictures and videos if you want them. The whole experience was great from start to finish and I would recommend this walk to anyone who is keen to experience this walk."

From start to finish the whole experience was expertly run. The climb leader was very reassuring, talking us though the whole thing, reassuring us of the safety and what to expect. The hardest part was the initial climb up the ladders to the main bridge walk but there was lots of reassurance. Once on the main bridge the walk was fairly easy with great views of the harbour and Sydney. Photographs are taken by the climb leader and available to purchase at the end. All in all a fabulous way to see Sydney,"

My suggestion here would be to catch a train from Wynyard to Milsons Point. You can catch unlimited train trips from one side of the Bridge to the other doing this, and they depart fairly frequently."

No, not the infamous \"bridge climb\"; too scary and too expensive. There is a footpath on the opera house side of the bridge that any one can walk across. This appears to be a little-known fact. We caught a ferry to Luna Park and then walked up the hill to find the entry point to the bridge stairs. After climbing these stairs, we found ourselves on the footpath of the bridge, we headed back to Circular Quay by foot! As you look out to your left, there is a beautiful view of the harbour and the opera house. My partner is scared of heights so he made sure to look out at eye level, not down! It's a pleasant walk, not particularly long, certainly not difficult and it's free! We felt a sense of achievement after we finished! There are stairs down to the Rocks on our descending side of the bridge. We wandered through this area which is really lovely, especially if it's your first visit."

For some reason, security guards are stationed at various points along the path.

Then given a harness and radio (to hear the leader as we climb), and shoes (if you were not wearing ones that were acceptable. Rainsuits can be provided if needed. You can keep your sun glasses, but they provide a harness for them that clips to your suit, so you can't drop them.You are not allowed to carry anything else, including cameras, watches, jewelery (other than some rings and stud earrings). They provide lockers for safe storage of these items, and you keep the key while you are there.The climb starts with you connecting the harness to a steel safety line that runs the whole length of the walk. The connection is via a cable from the harness to a slider that slips along the line. Once attached, you then walk an a catwalk directly under the bridge out past the stone pylons. Then a climb up 4 flights of ladders from below the roadway deck to the beginning of the upper arch span. This was the difficult part, as the stairs were quite steep. Once pas this, it was easy. The walk was a simple stroll up a series of low (vertical distance from one step to the next) wide metal steps, slowly moving up the arch to the top. It was not difficult or even tiring.I really do not like heights as a rule, but this did not get to me. In addition to being connected to a safety harness the whole time, the bridge felt very solid, secure and safe. So don't be worried about that.The guide pauses several times along the way for us to enjoy the views, while providing interesting information about the bridge, the tours, and the various things you can see.We reached the top of the arch, and the views were spectacular! We were there during a cool, sunny day. So everything was bright and clear. We looked down at the Opera house, up the channel to the harbors, and waived to all on the various tour boats below.The guide answered all questions we had about what we were seeing, and it was a great time. He also took pictures of us there with various things in the background. (One print is included with the price of the tour, and the others are available for an additional fee if you want them).We then crossed over to the other side, and took in the views there. (more pictures).We then walked down on the other arch, and then back down the ladders, and back over the catwalk.The whole tour took about 2.5 hours, and was well worth the time and cost. It really was not strenuous, and if you are in moderately good health, you should have no problems.  If you do make it to Sydney, don't miss this tour."

If you have a head for heights and want exhilaration, fantastic views and a true sense of achievement; then climb the Sydney Harbour Bridge, it's brilliant!I was in a party of 6 which was great and after 45 minutes preparation including breath test, health form check, kitting out and practice climb we were ready to walk ... We were 2 hours on the Bridge and I found the first 200m horizontal walk and vertical ladder climbing to the arch the worst as I became sccustomed to walking on a narrow walkway about 20m above the road and then having cars passing about 60cm away from me! But once once out on the arch it is wider and the gradual climb to the apex, 520 steps until 134m above the water, is fine with frequent stops to be told the landmarks by the guide and have drinking stops. You are tethered all the way and can take no personal possessions or cameras. The guide takes photos at various locations.It's brilliant and I did it on a sunny day and the views around and the activity below were amazing! Thoroughly recommend it ....."

It says you must be reasonably fit to make the climb, but there were 3 old people (and I mean old) doing the climb in our group, and they had no trouble. I wish it was more of a climb. It mostly is just a nice leisurely stroll. The only good thing is that I can say I climbed it. Other than that...meh. Rather boring and too many stops along the way. I guess they stop so people can catch their breath, but there is no need. If you have doubts about the climb (nervous), don't be nervous - it's not scary at all. It's just as if you're walking across the bridge. You're not close to the edge or have any treacherous paths."

We did the 3 hr Bridge Climb & agree with the comments already made on here.You are standing around a lot as there are many groups going up with only 5-10 mins or so between them so it does get hectic before you climb.We thought it best to advise people on what goes on before the climb as we wishes we had known about things beforehand to be better prepared.We were booked in & taken through to a room to get our jumpsuits, then through another door to the lockers & changing rooms. Everything has to go in the locker, you are not allowed to take anything up with you, not even a small bottle of water. It is best to go with a minimum of clothing as it gets very hot & being humid we did sweat buckets!We had to then go through a scanner to ensure we hadn't kept any items with us. This includes jewellery, watches, belts etc. We were then introduced to our guide, Maria, who was great, very helpful & friendly.She took us through to the harness & radio area where she took us through how to put on our harnesses. Some of us had difficulty sorting them out, but this was not a problem, she helped as much as she possibly could.Once we had our harness on we went through to be fitted with a radio which Maria tested to ensure all of us could hear her at all times. One Japanese lady couldn't hear her at all so it took a bit longer than normal to sort this out.The next stage is practising climbing up & down 2 ladders so we could find out how the harness & rope would work.We were then ready to go! We thought there should have been more water in the room before the bridge climb, as there was only one small fountain. With the heat we quickly got dehydrated. The climb was easy but I am not afraid of heights. My husband struggled with the ladders which you have to do before climbing the bridge & at the end. There were a few fountains on the climb but they are warm so not particularly nice to drink but of course we had no choice as that was all there was available. There were 2 water sprays on the journey which did freshen our faces up.The views were absolutely amazing so well worth doing the climb. It is expensive but we thought, well worth it."

I did the twilight bridge climb which started during the day and ended at night and the view from the top was breathtaking. The harbour and the opera house were at their fullest glory. Again, a must do for everyone visiting Sydney.One caveat. When booking the climb there were two options: The regular one which took about 3.5 hours and the express one which took about 2.5 hours. The only difference mentioned between the two was \"if you are fit, you can do the express\". So I thought the only difference would be we would climb faster.However, the real experience turned out to be much different. The express climb took us under the bridge and thru the steep staircases and narrow passes and it was not the experience I had expected at all. The description for the express did not mention anything about different routes. The full experience would have been much better, and definitely worth the extra one hour. It would have taken you above the bridge and thru a more scenic route. Would highly recommend the full tour and experience. Worth the money."

Booking the experience online was so easy and so we signed up for the sampler climb! We were given voucher to visit the Pylon Look Out on that day before doing the sampler climb. The climb was well organised, professionally conducted with all the safety issues are dealt with so you will feel safe doing the climb. Our climb leader Mr Rhys was jovial and friendly guy who made the climb interesting and less tiring!To do this you need a moderate level of fitness \u2013 it was just like climbing series of few short ladders and the stairs is around 45degress incline. What you get at the end of the climb?? A fantastic experience, awesome view and a storey to tell each time I see the Sydney Bridge - hey I climbed that bridge before!!!"

You can walk across for nothing, and visit the Pylon Museum (HIGHLY Recommended) for a minimal fee. If you have the time, you can get some nice shots by walking directly underneath the bridge. Luna Park makes for a great photo vantage point."

Climb the Southern Pilon located at the Rocks as Option B for this attraction. Entrance fee is much cheaper, A$24 per person. One is allowed to use his/her camera to take pictures, there are less steps to climb and the views you see are the same.4. See the Bridge either at the areas in front of the Opera House, at the Rocks, or at the Royal Botanic Garden (walk from the Garden to the Opera House). There are numerous places at these attractions to take beautiful pictures with the Sydney Harbour Bridge as your background.Now, make your choice and enjoy!"

Yes we heard some great reports from Harbour bridge climbers, and was going to do it one day, but after climbing up to Southern Pilon, we were more than happy. Up on the top, there is a all around Sidney breathtaking view, inside is a museum and some interesting statistics on Harbour Bridge, lovely souveneer shop with great books and souveneers, as well a big movie screen, for forther information. As it is so affordable, but so beautiful, it is a must visit spot, providing you can walk up the steps .Down the track, we will re visit, and will be taking our visitors there from interstate and overseas. There is no food purchase but snacks and drinks , yes. While in the area, please explore the Rocks area,. Best to be seen by foot !!"

When will have have another chance to do this?\" So I signed up to to the bridge walk.The staff are great at preparing you for your walk. You walk with a group and at least one (sometimes two or more guides). The staff get you suited up with your jumpsuit and put on your harness for you. The harness ensures you couldn't fall off the bridge if you tried. If the weather is bad, you'll get a jacket and hat- also secured to your jumpsuit, so nothing falls off *you*. I was initially apprehensive as we approached the catwalk, but found I was soon distracted by the sights I saw and the insights provided by our guide, Matt. Yes, there were a few moments when my palms started to sweat, but they were fleeting.After the catwalk where you're beneath the bridge deck, you climb a ladder that leads to the foot of the steel arch. You're still secured by your harness to a guideway that runs from the start of your walk, all the way to the very end. Again, you're always supremely safe. Once you've climbed the ladder your guide takes a few photos of you and there's a bubbler/water fountain, in case your mouth is dry. :) Then you start the real walk up the arch. The arch is wide, and the climb is very gradual. Our group included some people in their 70s who managed it without any difficulty. The wideness of the steel arch is reassuring, and it's completely steady. Even though you're walking up the bridge, even scaredy-cats will feel at ease here.The views are breath-taking in only the best way. Your guide will take additional photos of you and your friends, so there's no need (or ability) to bring your own camera or phone.After crossing over the top of the arch, you'll walk over to the east side where you'll walk down, down a ladder, cross a catwalk once again and into the visitors center.I'm very glad I did this, and you will be, too!"

            "review": "Stunning views of the city and the harbor. I would really recommend the bridge climb to anyone visiting Sydney who can afford the time and money.If you are older or afraid of heights, don't get discouraged. There is a photo of a 100-year-old lady who's done it, so it's really not that physically demanding and it's a great opportunity to face your fear under very safe circumstances. It's not so much a climb, as it is a walk. Most of the time you walk on steps (with the exception of a few ladders that they prepare you for), there is a railing on both sides and you are attached to a rope the whole time. So, really, no worries :). Now, I might have made some people think that it's boring, but it's really not. It's quite fun (especially if you get a silly tour guide) and the view is absolutely worth it. We scheduled for early twilight and our program (the actual climb is preceded with a well organized preparation) started around 6pm in March, which was great as we ascended during daylight, watched the sunset at the top and descended at night. It was perfect.Unfortunately, you don't get to take your camera with you, but your guide will take photos of you on several occasions and afterwards you can choose which ones you like and purchase them (about $20 each, I think).Additional tips: No alcohol beforehand, they test everyone. Eat something, so that you have energy, you're about to climb a bridge and the whole thing takes about 3 hours. Obviously don't overeat either, you're about to climb a bridge!If you are skinny as I am, I recommend to wear a warm shirt. They do give you a fleece jacket, but still, I was happy that I was also wearing a hoodie underneath the suit. It's windy up there and even at a hot day it can get quite chilly, especially as the sun is setting and it might not be as enjoyable if you are shaking cold as some girls in my group were.I hope this helps. Enjoy your climb! :)"

Crossing such an iconic landmark while having a great view of another felt really special. Although minute in comparison to the number of Padlocks you\u2019ll find on some landmarks, I loved reading the padlocks attached to the bridge. The wind also offers a change from hot old sydney! You can walk on the east side or cycle on the west side of the bridge. If neither of those views take your fancy you can walk across the top of the bridge with Bridge Climb but that will set you back a cool $250!"

This was trul an amazing experience, totally exhilarating and totally safe--it's 1,390 steps on your journey and the bridge climb gives some of the very best views of Sydney Harbour anywhere.When one is on the top looking down 440 feet to the water or looking for miles in any direction at Sydney and the environs, it's a fantastic feeling. The preparation and safety briefing are very thorough including a rehearsal of the proper way to climb the six stories or so of ladders (always 3 points of contact), the use of the safety cables--seems impossible to fall very far. They equip you with an over suit that has a large safety belt and everything is tied to you be it your hat (a souvenir), all your equipment-safety line, radio, rain coat and even handkerchiefs that are attached to your outfit. One goes through a metal detector to make sure you are carrying nothing that could become a missile to the cars and trains below if they drop and you are off with an obviously experienced guide.The guide narrates all the way up and down the journey giving interesting historical facts and anecdotes about the bridge. The climb is surprisingly not arduous, although if one has a fear of heights, this is not for you. You walk along a narrow catwalk to the decorative pylons which mask the ladders that bring you to the top portion of the bridge. Once you finish the ladder climb, one gently climbs up on the top arch of the bridge to the summit where there are flags flying. We were sort of lucky that a major wind and rain storm greeted us at the very top-yet no one felt unsafe. Once the storm subsided, we walked across another catwalk for 75 meters to the other side and then traversed downward. Everyone of our group of 7 were thrilled with it.They provide you witha picture and certificate of accomplishment.Big score for my bucket list!!!!"

As someone who is not at all keen on heights I was quite apprehensive about the prospect. I needn't have been. I frankly admitted that I was a liittle nervous about the prospect and was reassured that they are well used to this situation. Our Guide, Darren was an excellent guy who put me at ease from the outset. It was a breezy morning and before long I was fairly relaxed and enjoying the experience. We had a guy in his 70's in our party who was completing his 47th climb of the bridge. He hopes to do 50 climbs. The experience on reaching the peak of the bridge beside the Australian flags was very exhilarating and the views of the harbour and the Opera House were unforgettable. When we started our descent the wind speed increased to around 40-45kph. I was glad they were no stronger. Apparently the day before the weather had turned quite nasty at one point and some climbs were cancelled for safety reasons, so we were lucky. I should add that safety is the No.1 priority, and at no time did I feel unsafe as you are securely attached to a steel cable which runs adjacent to the handrails along the full course of the climb.This was an experience we will never forget. I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone who is reasonably fit and to those who, like myself, are nervous of heights I would simply say \"Pluck up the courage and do it. You will never regret it\". Again a very big thank you to Darren who was an excellent Guide."

Our guide for the day was Nick and within minutes he knew all our names and was always quick with a joke or advice.Although it was wet and blustery on the day we did the climb, it did nothing to diminish the sheer exhilaration that we all felt as we made our way to the top of the bridge, The views were amazing and Nick came up with a running commentary about what to look out for and how the bridge was constructed. I can honestly say that although I had done the climb before the adrenaline rush was just as good as the first time and I would certainly have a third go at it should the opportunity arise. Age is no barrier if you are reasonably fit, so I would definitely recommend having a go. It's not cheap but it's a memory that will stay with you for ever."

We opted for the full bridge climb to start around 16:00. This is slightly cheaper than the twilight climbs but because of the time of year we still experienced a change in light and the start of the sun going down on our way back to base.We were given a warm welcome from the team at the front desk and it was suggested we get a bite to eat at the onsite cafe if we hadn't already eaten- it's a long climb after all! We didn't make any purchases at the cafe as we'd already indulged!We did, however, buy some souvenirs in the shop where the usual magnets, t-shirts and cuddly toys are available.At our bridge climb time we were greeted by another member of staff who introduced us to the rest of our tour group and helped us get kitted out. The staff were incredibly knowledgeable and able to hand us all a bodysuit to wear just by looking at us- no embarrassing announcements of 'LARGE!' here! :DWe were then passed over to our tour guide who walked us over a 'test' bridge to see how we felt about being that bit higher up. Graham then helped us with our harnesses, health and safety info, radios and walked us through a practise structure so that we could all have a go at using the safety clips before being up on the bridge itself. There was plenty of opportunity to ask questions, get used to small increments of height and get comfortable in our group.Graham was so friendly, knowledgable and full of quirky stories about both the bridge and Sydney & surrounding areas.The bridge itself?

Tourists and locals can walk across, drive across, take a bus or even a train to the other side. For the more adventuresome they can walk up the span of the Bridge."

You will need to allow at least three hours as some time is spent getting fitted out with safety gear etc. The guides are very informative and the pace of climb is easy. There are a few ladders to climb at the start and end which are vertical but apart from those the climb is fairly easy. We did the climb early as it was summer and can be very hot in Sydney so consider that when booking. Yes it is expensive but we felt worth every cent. Be sure to have something to eat before you climb as the guide did ask if we had eaten, breakfast in our case."

Doing the bridge climb was not something I thought I had any real desire to do but we were in Sydney for probably the only time in our lives so my husband was keen to do it. Obviously this is not cheap at $148 but it is a huge thing to have done. We were asked to complete a health form and then had to be breathalysed. Then it was into our sexy suits and all the various paraphernalia to keep us hooked up and in communication with our guide. I did admit to feeling a tad nervous so our guide, Maria, put me at the front of the group with her. My nerves were nothing to do with height or anything but simply about the physical effort required as I am 62 and in good health but do suffer from fibromyalgia and back problems. The climb has 2 distinct stages - initially you have to climb up steep ladders - 4 sets of these - and then the rest of the climb is up gradual wide spaced steps which just seem to go on forever. Maria was an amazing guide and was talking to us through our headphones constantly giving lots of interesting facts about the bridge and pointing out the interesting sights below us. She also kept stopping to do this which gives you a chance to catch your breath and have a good look around. She also took pictures of us at various points ( you cannot take anything with you on the climb so cannot take your own pics). At the summit she took a picture of our whole group and this one is given to you together with your certificate in with the price of the climb. Going back down was actually harder for me especially down the ladders as you are looking down on a 6 lane road with railway lines on both sides and when trains went rattling by on both sides I did cling on to those ladders! Eventually after 3 hours or so we were back on terra firma and I was just so proud of my achievement and so glad I had done it. We were shown the photos Maria had taken on screen and could have printed copies for $18 or have a flash drive containing all 7 photos plus the 10 second video we had also recorded at the summit for $59 which is what we did. Having done the climb we were given free tickets to go up the viewing pylon at the side of the bridge which we did a couple of days later and I actually found climbing those 200 steps harder than all the bridge climb but the views were great and we had the opportunity to take our own photos up there. We were lucky to have perfect weather for our climb and all in all it is definitely one of the greatest things I have ever done."

I both walked across (and back) and climbed the Sydney Harbor Bridge.The walk across is free, and there are 4 or 5 security guards along the way. The walkway is on the Opera House side of the bridge, which is good for pictures. Get directions as to how to get onto the bridge.The bridge climb is very expensive, but is a once in a lifetime event. I did the twilight climb. I was scheduled for the 6:30 climb, but since I had arrived early, they offered me a chance to go with the 5:45 group, which I did. That may have been a mistake in late January, as the sun was only setting as we were already going down, so not many lights had come on. The plus side was that we were climbing the bridge as a criuse ship was departing, so the pictures taken by our group leader had the cruise ship in it.When you climb the bridge, you have to be sober (they give you a breath-analyser test), you should have had something to eat in the last 3 or 4 hours, and you have to take off anything that could possibly fall off. You wear a jump suit, with nothing but your undies on under it (in summer), and everything they give you to take along is strapped onto the jumpsuit - earphones/radio; hat; handkerchief; headlight; and belt to hook onto the safety cable. They give you practice on the proper way to climb a ladder (encountered at the beginning and end of your climb), along with other safety instructions. They tell you about the last chance bathrooms several times before you start.When you climb the bridge, you start on the Opera House side of the bridge. At the top (where the flags are), you cross over to the inner harbor side, and go back down to where you started.At the end, you get to keep the hat, but pictures (that they took) and a T-shirt that says you climbed the bridge have to be bought."

I wasn't sure if I really wanted to do the bridge climb, it is quite expensive and takes longer than it seems like it should. But having gone recently on a twilight climb, I'd say it was well worth it. What an amazing view, and to see the city go from day-light, to sunset, and into evening. While I really loved it and would recommend it, I would also say it's not something you MUST do, especially if funds are tight. Maybe just walk across the bride, or take a taxi/bus/train across. There's actually some great little neighborhoods on the other side worth checking out for dinner/drinks or just a stroll.It definitely takes longer than I it should; there's a lot of waiting while groups ahead of you are getting through their climb and the guides taking photos of all the climbers. I felt completely safe the entire time, they've definitely taken precautions throughout. It's a bit frustrating/annoying that you can't take your own camera, but considering the time and safety implications, it's understandable. To purchase the photos is ridiculously expensive in my opinion, but was hard to turn down after spending so much to do that amazing climb. Having done the climb with a friend of mine, we split the cost ($60 total) of purchasing a flash drive with 10 photos of our choice, plus the group and sunset shots our guide took. Our guide was really knowledgeable and friendly, as I'm sure all of them are. He was giving fun facts and telling stories throughout, but definitely wasn't following a script, which was nice. He also allowed questions, and he always seemed to have the answers. I definitely learned things I didn't know beforehand.Things to know... - I'd really recommend wearing sneakers/runners; for both comfort and safety. I wouldn't worry so much about clothing. - They give you a jumpsuit to wear, and you take off all other clothing except underwear...at least that's how it was on my climb in early March. - It really does take about 3 - 3.5 hours from start to finish.- Do NOT drink before your climb. Common sense says it just isn't safe, AND they breathalyzer you before you do anything."

We got to see the sunset and came down the bridge in the evening to see the city lights. It was a good choice of times on March 16. So make sure you think this through even you want both day and night views. The groups after us did not get both experiences. The trip takes about 3 hours. 1 hour is prep, 30 minutes to select and pay for pictures, and 2 hours on the bridge. I felt very prepared as they give you everything you need: jump suit, hat, headlight, headset to hear the leader, belt with cable to attach you to the line that you are attached to, hanky and there is probably more. This was really well thought out. They give you a group shot, video of you say a few words about the climb and a certificate at the end. It was a great experience and I liked seeing everything in the day and night. Our guide took some pictures which were available for purchase at the end. The cost of a package that includes 10 pictures on a USB was $59. There were only a few more shots that our guide took. I think they should have put all the shots on the drive for the money paid. Then there would be less of a line at the end. Also it would have been a better value. I loved the experience. Our guide was excellent. The place is a bit hard to find, so plan accordingly!"

The groups are a little big and even though the tour took 3.75 hours, only 1.75 hours of that time were on the actual bridge. If groups were a little smaller, the set up, safety briefing, etc. would not have to be as long. However, we still had a great time and our guide was really energetic and fun. The best part was being able to sit on top of the bridge and just look out over the water. Very relaxing even that high up!! It was a great one-time event."

Personally, I think $100 knocked off the price tag would be much fairer. In Sydney the two things you want to look at are the Bridge and the Opera House, and if you're on top of one of those, the view is beautiful but you're not really seeing anything new. The best thing about the experience was the guide pointing out Fort Dennison where I went for lunch the next day and would absolutely recommend with every ounce of my being."

I recently re-visited, what we Australians affectionately call the 'Coathanger', the Sydney Harbour Bridge which was opened on Saturday March 19th 1932 by the then Premier Jack Lang, after some six years of construction. With a height of 141m (or 134 m depending on where the measurement is taken) it is I believe still the world's largest (but not longest) steel arch bridge.Designed by Dr Bradfield of the NSW Department of Public Works he was the Chief Engineer of Sydney Harbour Bridge and Metropolitan Railway Construction. The main roadway across the bridge is known as the Bradfield Highway and is about 2.4 km long, making it one of the shortest highways in Australia. When it opened, it cost a car six pence (5 cents) to cross and a horse and rider was 3 pence (about 2 cents).OK forget the history and take stroll along the bridge with your camera in hand to view Sydney\u2019s highlights such as the Circular Quay, the Rocks, Sydney\u2019s central business district (CBD),the Harbour with its majestic sailing boats and of course the iconic Sydney Opera House. At night, the views are breath-taking and memorable.Take the kids, grandma, or your friends visiting Sydney. Easy to access and with parking in around the area it is a must visit for 2015."

It is iconic - a masterpiece of engineering, standing proud and tall - spanning arguably the most beautiful harbour in the world. Volumes have been written about it. Millions of photos have captured it. Every visitor to Sydney wants to see it.There are many ways to view the bridge - from land sea or air.Or from the bridge itself!Organised Bridge Climbs are very popular - but are pricey and require a great deal of physical exertion.A less strenuous way to enjoy the bridge - from the bridge - is to walk to one of the two massive pylons supporting the structure.Begin your walk from \"The Rocks\" area near Circular Quay. A short walk from the Quay will take you to Cumberland Street, and from here intrepid travellers can access the substantial flight of steps that take one up onto the pedestrian walkway across the bridge. Heading north, as if to cross the bridge, a delightful walk of some 400 metres will bring one to the southeastern pylon. Follow the signs and enter the pylon where a succession of steepish steps will lead to a level where one may pay a small fee to continue to the top for spectacular views of the city, harbour and bridge structure itself. The views really are breathtaking, and provide something a little different and very special to capture as a reminder of your trip to Sydney - and Sydney's iconic Harbourt Bridge."

I initially grumbled to myself that there lots of other groups ahead of us that we had to wait for, but it actually works like a well oiled machine and a rest after the first big climb was needed! It goes without saying that the views are stunning. The guide takes multiple photos along the way and they're not too expensive to buy - $55 for all photos on a cd; and you're also given a free group photo and climb certificate. An amazing experience that isn't the cheapest thing to do, but well worth it, as I'm not sure where else you can do something like this."

My initial reaction when I first saw the bridge was \"What a grubby bridge, what is all the fuss about?\" This was due to the mass of metal imposing on a very picturesque harbour. In fact it does have a sort of beauty, but of course, it is nice to see such an iconic landmark. Not far from the opera house either. You can take a hike over the arched metalwork spanning over the bridge. It does cost $280 AUD for a 3.5 hour hike. I didn't bother. I later discovered that you can go up in the supporting towers for nothing. Too late though. The old street on the Sydney side heading back into the city, is worth seeing. The juxtaposition of old with the backdrop of new city. It also has the oldest pub in Sydney. Something Australia does have a few of, is proper British type pubs, rather than continental type watering holes (though they have them as well)."

Everything was extremely well organised and the group leader made sure those who feared heights were made comfortable. The walk itself was not as difficult as I thought it would be and the views at the top are absolutely amazing. You are given adequate time to take in the views and the group leader takes a number of photos around the bridge. You are attached to a radio the whole time and your group leader explains a lot about the history of the bridge and its design and building which is all very interesting. A must do attraction in Sydney! Definitely worth the money (and as a backpacker, money is scarce!)"

The Twilight climb leaves in the late afternoon and allows you to see the City in both daytime and nighttime conditions. It really is the best of both worlds. In addition, it is generally cooler once the sun goes down. Our guide (Tom) was great - funny and entertaining. One couple in our group (of 14) got engaged at the top of the bridge. It was incredibly sweet (and she said yes). I have mild fear of heights, but being tethered to the bridge helped a lot. Climbing up the bridge was actually the least scary part for me - walking on the catwalks to get to the arch was actually the most challenging. It was something I've always wanted to do - and I'm so glad we did."

One side of the bridge is for cyclists the other walkers, which is very strictly monitored by bridge wardens, 20 min walk from one side to the other with plenty of stopping points. You can pay to go up to higher observation point. Sadly some impatient joggers made me and others feel very unwelcome, I thought maybe I was in the wrong 'lane' but the wardens assured me not.

The tether line is very secure and the instructions were very specific.Once we completed the instruction portion of the trip, we got to walk out and on the actual bridge. The walk is peppered with stops for hydration as well as education. The groups are small so you quickly make friends with your climbing mates. There are also many spots where the staff take your photo. Note no personal cameras or iPhones allowed, that was part of the security briefing. When you are on the bridge you will quickly understand why that makes sense.We had spectacular views of the harbor, Opera House, Circular Quay and the surrounding suburbs. Thrilling, exciting and beautiful. If you have time in Sydney add this to your Must do list"

The walk across the bridge - either from the south to north or vice versa is a fantastic way of seeing Sydney and its Harbour from a brilliant vantage point. You can walk across the bridge at any time - there are some great photo opportunities of the city and the Opera House. To get the best view of them all you have to try the Bridge Walk - which takes you on a guided tour to the top of the bridge. You can book this through many tourist operations in Sydney or simply book it on line. Its very popular - so you have to plan in advance to secure a spot."

You can drive across it in a car or on a train. You can walk across it. If you go to the end of The Rocks you can look up underneath it, which certainly gives you a different perspective of its size and scope.Of you can catch a ferry from Circular Quay to Parramatta which will sail you underneath it.But the most exciting and adventurous for those not frightened of heights is to climb over the bridge. But it is not cheap - starting at $248, depending on whether you chose a Day, Twilight, Night or Dawn climb."

So I would recommend the harbour bridge climb for anyone who loves to take a million photos of the same thing and loves waiting around in queues\u2026 ok that was a bit mean\u2026 Overall this was a great experience and something to tick off a \u2018must do list\u2019. But would I ever do it again? Probably not. I think they may have an express climb (I think) I would recommend this for anyone who wants to do the climb in an hour or 2 (instead of 5) and not stand around for hours. The guide was great, he was loads of fun, he was more interesting to chat to individually rather then listen to his standard commentary, which I think he may have been bored after repeating a 100 times that day.I did the twilight climb, and we didn\u2019t see any sunset but the city still looked stunning at dusk / night. The view was amazing, because there was lightening in the distance it was really beautiful to see over the harbour. Generally it was a fun experience, but the only thing that brought it down for me was all the waiting around! It was unbelievably boring. I\u2019m talking about getting there on time and then waiting 2 hours to actually start the climb. And they take photos at about 4 different points on the bridge, and it seems like they spend 5min on every person - try waiting for everyone in the group (about 15 ppl).Maybe I just have a short attention span? But I did the climb with my sister and she felt the same way. A lot of my friends have done the climb, and they all agree the only negative is the amount of wasted time, and it can bring down the whole experience; because you start getting frustrated, fidgety, bored and annoyed. And the group photo is annoying \u2013 does anyone actually spend the $40 for the random group photo?!? I think Kids would love it, families would love it, maybe new couples would as well because there is so much opportunity for hand holding and taking in the view\u2026 and then a romantic dinner in the harbour afterwards would really make it a perfect date!"

If you choose to climb the Bridge with Bridge Climb then the lower arch route is my choice and will take you to the summit as you climb through the Bridge rather than on top of it. After experiencing the Bridge, celebrate in the Australian way by having a beer in a Pub in The Rocks or Kirribilli."

The two big rock pylons at either end do not hold up the structure but these ginormous hinges. The pylon at the Rocks/ City end is open to the public. It is reasonably priced and the view from the top is great as well. The Harbour bridge, like the Opera House is something you can lookat and say \"well there it is I have seen it\" or take the time to really look at it and be amazed at how clever man is at building things."

While the Bridge Climb is a good experience, if you don't fancy the price or have a problem with heights a better bet would be the walk over the bridge ... costs you nothing ..... though you might want to spend a few dollars at a cafe (either end). The pylon lookout has a small charge but is very good value, has heaps of interesting information and fantastic views. The other good thing about the walk .... YOU get to pick the time you do it, and how fast or slow you want to go. You can pick your spot to stop and wonder, and admire the view. You won't be hurried along by other groups coming behind you. Just watch out for people running though, and try not to get in their way."

It is pricey, but when you are made aware of the safety measures and preparation that is involved, you understand why it costs what it does. The staff are all very well trained and friendly. The climb itself is only a little taxing, but good mobility in the legs is essential. The views are excellent, you can certainly see a long way. I'd like to go again, but I would prefer to do a dawn walk. Watching the sunrise from on top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge would be amazing."

This was the second time I have climbed Sydney Harbour Bridge, the first was with my brother, who was visiting from the UK and my two older sons. This time I went with my youngest son who was now old enough to make the climb and we chose a night time climb to see the lights. We arrived in plenty of time after walking from Darling Harbour. I recommend that you eat and drink before going on any climb as the food and drink options on site are limited to snack foods only and the climb takes about 3 hours in total. We were kitted out quickly with all the gear and did the practice climb on equipment inside the building and then started the walk.I think that anyone with a normal level of fitness can do the climb but there is a steep ascent and decent at the start and end of the walk. Once past these the rest of the walk is relatively easy with lots of stops for photos and views of the city. Hint - buy the photo package as part of the tour it is worth it as you cannot take your own cameras with you.Off the two walks (day or night) I think the night tour is much more impressive. Seeing the city and harbour lit up is amazing and we had the added pleasure of seeing fireworks from the Sydney cricket ground, a great bonus. Wear loose and comfortable clothes as you have to don a jumpsuit to carry all of the safety gear and it could get hot if you are wearing heavy or thick clothes under it.I highly recommend this tour for anyone visiting Sydney its a great way to see harbour and sites like the Opera House, Circular Quay and the city in general"

The bridge itself is awesome - great to take pcitures of and walk across. I did the Bridge Climb as well, and I had mixed feelings. It was a fun experience, and the view is incredible. but they have turned it into big business by taking your picture. You're not allowed to bring ANYTHING on the climb with you - you actually strip totally naked and put on a special suit. not even bobby pins, so definitely no cameras. Then you go to climb the bridge which is easy and fun, and the tour guide had a lot of good stories. But most of the time you spend waiting around while the people in front of you get their picture taken, and then you take their spot and get your picture taken. The pictures were good, but they charge quite a bit for them, I think it was around 65 AUD for 4 digital copies. And after you spend an hour or so waiting around to have them taken, you want them! So.. good time, great view, but not so great of a value I thought."

After all it is a once in a lifetime opportunity as not everyday you get given this chance. My husband has been in the past a little afraid of heights - although he is getting much better now. He will say that this experience looks far worse then it actually is and once you are up there you are thinking of nothing else but what amazing views you can see. We decided to spend a little extra on the tickets and book a climb for sunset time. We though this would be a lovely time to go seeing sunset and the city by day and then by night on the way down. The day that we had booked our climb ended up being a little bit cloudy so we didn't get to experience the best sunset imaginable but we did still get to see pretty colors in the sky and the city coming alive at night. Within our group was a very elderly lady who the bridge climb team were worried and conscious about her making it up to the top. She did seem to have a few walking difficulties but after the team asked her various health and safety checks allowed her to go up the bridge with her two grandchildren. I cannot fault in the slightest the bridge climb team. They were very professional and conscious of her throughout the whole experience. They were radioing each other every step of the way to make sure she was all ok. They worked together to make sure she could reach the top without difficulties. I am so glad she managed to experience this climb and see the views at the top. I would recommend anyone to do this, even if you are not 100% with heights, do it to concur your fears. It looks much worse then it is and you will be concentrating to much taking each step then you would be realizing how high you up. With each step our guide gave us very informative information with regards to the surrounds, the bridge, the history and was able to answer any question we through at him. All in all a fab experience which I will remember for a very long time :-)"

To get hold of a good shot of the bridge, head towards Jeffrey Street Wharf (Kirribilli area). You could also fit the harbour and the Opera House, both in one frame!"

The views from the top of Sydney Harbour Bridge are fantastic, but don't be fooled into thinking that the summit is what it is all about because the actual climb from 'clipping on' at the bottom until you stand at the summit, is an unbelievable experience in itself. Try to do the 'climb' either at dawn or sunset to make your experience even more memorable, but just to climb anytime is a must. If it isn't in the top 3 on your bucket, then there is something seriously wrong. I can give it my personal recommendation and on a scale of 1 to 10 ...... I give it 11.

Once at the top the views are incredible and even a short shower of rain could not dampen our sense of achievement.

The entire journey was a well tuned, highly thought out, professional and informative experience. From the moment you step through the doors, to the fitting of the required \"bridge climb suit\" to the safety harness, the practice steps, the safety talk, fitting of headphones and the alcohol breath test (even on my 13 year old). No stone unturned in this entire experience. The staff were amazing (especially Alessandro) I would reccomend this experience to anyone."

Easier to start from north side, footpath starts next to Milsons Point train station. Stunning views, good exercise. Take precautions to avoid sunburn as it's not sheltered. The vibrations from trains can be unnerving but prove how sturdy this remarkable structure is. A small museum (with entry fee) is on top of the southern pylon. Check out the plaques at the southern end of footpath (top of stairs next to roadway) from opening day in 1932. The footpath is 70metres above the water and from up there you can appreciate how the bridge was Sydney's tallest structure for many years. The bridge feels alive with activity, the bridge keeps Sydney moving, the bridge IS Sydney. It's brilliant at night also."

Climbing the bridge, particularly at Sunset, is the my second most favorite experience in Australia (the first is scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef\"). You've got to admire the carefulness with which you are \"trained\" to make the climb and put you at ease before venturing out. It is completely safe, each climber is tethered to a bar with redundant other safety measures. But that's the mechanics. The climb itself is phenomenal and not at all hard unless you have a phobia for heights. We did it with the sun perfectly positioned and birds eye view of the harbor, the city, the Opera House, Botanical Gardens. Coming down we saw the lights from the traffic below and cityscape. If you miss this one, it's your loss...well worth the time and effort."

The only reason I can't enthusiastically give it 5/5 is the cost, but if there is an attraction worth $250 pp then I suppose this would be included.The first hour or so is all about familiarization with the safety equipment and a practice run on some ladders. Once the bridge climb starts, you head out as a group with your leader and are tied off with a belt at all times. The climb leaders did a great job talking to everyone over headsets and keeping any people with fear of heights motivated to keep going. We did the standard experience, and we took lots of breaks which kept everyone from over exerting themselves and allowed time to soak it all in. Periodically through the climb, the leader takes photos and these are available for purchase afterwards, whether you pre bought the photo package or not. We don't typically get photo packages, but these views and the experience were worth it for sure.Climbing the bridge you end up with amazing harbour views as well as Sydney skyline including the Opera House. It was a great day, and a super experience, and I'm very glad we did it.One thing to note is you will have to wear one of their bridge climb overalls, and its best to dress very light underneath or it can get hot. They give lockers, but you wont be allowed to bring ANY personal items or things in your pockets due to risked of dropped objects so plan accordingly."

The Bridgeclimb company is Extremely efficient and organized. They are all about safety - yours and the users of the bridge. You will be issued a jumpsuit. You'll have tethers for eyeglasses, sunglasses and hats. If your shoes are not up to par you'll be loaned a pair of socks and runners. Everything is spotless - they have an impressive in house laundry. They also have rain suits and fleece for poor weather. You will have a belt with a tether cable and a wireless radio/headset. Once all kitted up you will be comfortable and secure - nothing to drop or come loose in the wind. At times the walk is noisy - under the roadway and the railway, and it was breezy up top. We never felt dangerously exposed - there are hand rails and solid walkways at all times. Certainly there are long drops over the edges but it never felt precarious. We put ourselves at the end of our group, which meant we never felt pressured by anyone behind. Our guide kept close tabs on everyone, making sure the pace was good. The ladders (more like steep stairs than actual ladders) were fine - the only iffy part was transferring from a ladder to platforms between then - take your time and it's all good. We had a breezy, overcast not too hot morning and it was very comfortable. It could be a challenge on a very hot day and not so fun in rain or cold. The views are fantastic and it was a really fun thing to do. Worth the cost!"

First go to their web site: www.bridgeclimb.com and you will find everything you need to know about all the possible climbs (more than one). I did everything from my hotel room the night before I wanted to climb. I have been hearing about this climb for 10 years when my husband went to Sydney on business. He won't climb it but that didn't stop me!  Since I am over 60 I wanted to just try it and when I saw the Bridge Climb Sampler described I decided that was the perfect climb for me. It is 1 1/2 hours and $148 for an adult. This is a very organized and safe climb. (as I'm assuming they all are). Never, ever did I doubt Brad's ability, skills, or enthusiasm for what he was doing. Nor was I ever fearful for my safety. Our group was only 5 plus the guide so we did not have headsets. We just stopped when needed and Brad told us what we were doing next.It is thrilling and fun with spectacular views. Since you cannot carry cameras or phones or anything with you you will just have to remember how wonderful the views are. While I climbed my husband walked the bridge which we both did together on another day. You get the wonderful views from a walk (which is free) if that is your desire. If you climb you get a coupon for 2 to go up in the Pylon - 200 steps but another way to get fantastic pictures. You can also pay to do this. We gave our coupon to a couple walking the bridge since we did not have time to use it. They were from the Netherlands, limited English, but were thrilled to get this coupon. They kept asking how much we wanted for it! After much explanation and charades they understood and we were happy to give it.If you have any inkling at all to do this you must. Don't leave Sydney wishing you did.I'm looking at the questions below and want to add that there are bathroom facilities in the building you are in before and after the climb but of course not during the climb."

Our guide, a gentlemen originally form the States who had been living in Australia for around 14 years, was excellent. He had brilliant knowledge of the bridge (Obviously part of his job) and was very accomodating to our questions also with a good, humourous personality. I'm not usually scared of heights, however, when you first step out on the beams its a little nervy however I adapted straight away as you are 99% safe. It also makes you think how on earth they made this spectalular bridge in the 1920's (You'll find an in-depth analysis of the history of the bridge which is facinating).I would do this again if a friend wanted company but it is great value for money and is a sort of once in a lifetime thing."

The training is great and gives you an idea of what its going to be like - not as easy as you think.You are harnessed up and hooked onto a wire so your perfectly safe, then comes the hardest bit of the whole walk - you walk across this mesh platform and your like 12m up and you can see straight down - a few deep breaths and we made it across. you then climb and walk and weave your way around to the top of the arch and you have the most breath taking view of sydney - you can see for miles.Once over the mesh bit its not scary at all, its quite an easy climb, i had a little trouble cause of my short legs - that was about it. The guides are amazing and know the answer to any questions about the bridge you could think of . . and if they don't they will have the answer for you before you reach the bottom.Make sure you do the full climb not the express one - its so worth it!!!"

Unfortunately for us it did rain for pretty much the whole climb, but we were well equipped with our wet weather gear so it didn't hinder us too much. I was a little apprehensive before I started but soon felt safe and happy to just get on with it and enjoy it. We had a nice group of people, and were witness to a marriage proposal at the summit, so that was an added bonus. Grahams cheerfulness, banter and awful jokes made the whole experience even more enjoyable. If you go to Sydney the bridge climb is a must. Fabulous experience and would happily do it all over again!

As the time ticked away to our climb time I was extremely nervous, but excited too. There was nothing to be worried about at all, what a muppet! The organisation on this was without doubt faultless. The safety element was second to none. Our afternoon was brilliant, the day was fine so of course that added to it. I knew I could do it but never thought in a million years it's something would do. So very glad I did. Jacinta our guide was wonderful. Having climbed to the top and looking across Sydney harbour/city it didn't even seem an effort and I'm not fitness fanatic either!

I highly recommend the Pylon for great views of the city and way less hassle than the bridge walk. Maybe if you have a few days in Sydney, do the bridge walk, but that in itself will take 1/2 day. You'll want to spend some time seeing the art downtown, the opera house, and the botanic garden. All hard to do if you are coming off your $200 bridge tour. Pylon was great. It is important to note how to get there. You need to go to the East Side of the bridge as the West Side is for bikers only. You get on from a bridge access area. Take Cumberland Street toward the harbour. There will be stairs leading up to the bridge platform. It isn't the highest point on the stairs--if you get to the top and see a fence in front of you, walk down to the next platform and walk toward the harbor. You'll see the bridge clearly in about 5 minutes from that point. You can walk to the end of the street and see the underside of the bridge as well. There was a lot of construction when I was there, so not too exciting. As you are walking toward the center of the bridge, you'll come to the pylon. Take the stairs up to pay for your $13 ticket and see Sydney from a great vantage point. Overall, a great day with some great pictures to show for it."

As it can cost a lot of money we booked months in advance (especially as we climbed on the 29th Dec, so spaces were limited).The view was fantastic. But what really made it a worth while experience (and getting value for money) was that we had well over an hour on the bridge, when actually the climb could have been done in less than 20 mins. The experience, form start to finish, took 3.5 hours. This included safety briefings, getting kitted up, a simulator, the climb, then returning kit.We went on an exceptionally hot day, but thankfully the kit we were given, including a hat, was suitable to carry on regardless. The highlight was a water fan to spray our faces before we climbed down!This is for all abilities. There are four vertical ladders (if I remember correctly), each being no higher than domestic ladder. Once you have climbed these, the curve of the bridge is all steps, so is not strenuous at all. You are always attached to a cable on the bridge with a harness - no risk you are going anywhere even if you tried.It was our tour guide, however, that made it the most fun. It was the combination of a free comedy show and a history lesson. We all felt comfortable and had a great laugh (in a group of approx 10). I recommend everyone should do it at some point."

            "review": "Great icon and enjoyable walk. The Sydney Harbour Bridge (affectionately \"The Coathanger\") is a great Sydney icon, rivalling the Opera House in its fame. There are so many different activities involving the bridge.1. TAKE A GREAT PHOTO OF THE BRIDGE from the walkway between Circular Quay and the Opera House. It is beautiful in the morning light and when lit up at night. You can get an alternative view from the wharf outside Luna Park, or even an underneath view nearby or from Hickson Road on the southern end of the Quay. Get to Luna Park via the ferry to Milson's Point from the Quay, or take the train from Wynyard station to Milson's Point. This will take you over the bridge itself.2. WALK OVER THE BRIDGE. To do this there are many access points:a. at the eastern end of Circular Quay, take the lift to the Cahill Expressway, and walk towards the bridge. Descend a few stair cases and then stroll over the bridge. It's not too strenuous a walk, but there are stairs at both ends to negotiate. At the other end, you can either walk back, catch the ferry from Milson's Point to the Quay, or catch the train or bus at Milson's Point back to the city.b. walk west from the Quay across the little park near the northern end of Pitt Street. Look for The Nurses Steps and then follow the signs to the staircase to the bridge.c. At Milson's Point, go to the station entrance near Broughton St, turn right, and walk up the staircase to the bridge.The views from the bridge are great. See the harbour, the Opera House, the Quay, any cruise liners that are in, Fort Denison etc etc. You can also go into the small museum and lookout at the southern pylon, although the views are no better from the higher vantage point. Note: pedestrians can only walk across the eastern side of the bridge. Bike riders can use the western side of the bridge.3. DO THE BRIDGE CLIMBBridgeClimb offers safe climbing opportunities, both during the day and at night. See their website for details.4. CATCH THE TRAINCatch the train from the city to Milson's Point over the bridge and back.Whichever way you do it, you will love The Coathanger.PROS- walking across is FREE- there are many access points- there are great photo opportunities both OF the bridge and FROM the bridge- there are many activities involving the bridge- Security guards patrol the bridge- it is not a strenuous walkCONS- no wheelchair access to the bridge walkway at either end- it can get a little windy"

It is an iconic structure which carries cars, trains and pedestrians (and even climbers). It is a photographer's highlight of Sydney, along with its near neighbour, the Sydney Opera House. They complement each other, especially on New Year's Eve with the celebratory fireworks, giving a beautiful night vista to thousands of people occupying various vantage points around the harbour. The bridge is also a magnificent sight coming into Sydney Harbour from a cruise ship perspective."

I thought $308 was expensive for the bridge climb, but after doing it, I can see where the money goes. This highly organised company knows its stuff and right from the staff on reception on arrival to the people who do the induction and suit you up to the person who accompanied us on the walk, they were the most professional bunch of people I've come across in a long time. Everything has been thought of in regards to the equipment and no expense was spared in ensuring our safety and well-being. Set aside 3 hours for the walk as you'll need every minute of it. I did the twilight walk, which I believe is a bit more expensive than doing it in daytime, but the views were worth every extra cent. I shouldn't have been worried about not being fit enough as you go so slowly with very frequent stops, you don't get the chance to get tired. The only thing that will take your breath away is the view!! This is suitable for children right up to oldies, so long as you can walk and climb stairs, you'll have no problem. Highly recommended."

The first hour or so was spent on the safety aspects, and when I saw the harnesses and experienced how they worked, I was relieved that there would be no problem with the safety. Then it was out to the bridge. At first we had to navigate a couple of small openings and some ladders, but after that it was a pleasant and comfortable hike to the top. Lots of stops while our guide pointed out all the sights and let everyone catch up. No problems with exertion at all. The safety harnesses all have wires that slide up channels going all the way up and down the bridge, so there's no way one could fall off. Plus, the steps are very wide with comfortable railings. A highlight of this trip was the pictures that are taken at the top with the Opera House in the background that you can then purchase at the conclusion of the trip. We used ours for our annual Christmas card this year with lots of compliments. People asked if it was as fun as it looked, to which we replied \"more than that\"!."

I know many people are scared of the heights and safety factors, however, there is nothing to be worried about. You are constantly attached to the bridge and they have about an hour safety briefing/training with you before you go out. It is a once in a lifetime experience and I would recommend this for ANYONE.

            "review": "Best thing in Sydney. I'll split this review into 3 sections: looking at the bridge, walking across the bridge and doing the BridgeClimb.Firstly, there's no excuse why anybody visiting Sydney shouldn't get close enough to look at the bridge. Standing at the harbour you can see clearly both the bridge and the opera house, the iconic Sydney images. So yeah, I don't think I need to say much about that, at least go and look at it!If you want to walk across the bridge then you can. There is a pedestrian path which has been blocked off from the traffic and trains so there is no chance you being run over. Equally, there is no chance of you falling off and the walls on the path are high! It doesn't take too long to walk over and you get wonderful views of the Opera house as you go. If you have the time then take a stroll over and back for the views.Now, the best experience of all is doing the bridgeclimb. Okay, so on paper it looks pretty expensive. I'm a backpacker, on somewhat of a budget, but I thought I should give it a try. After doing this I can say that it's not something you should do, but something that you have to do. The whole experience takes around 3.5 hours , from going in, getting set up etc to coming down, getting photos and walking out the door. You could walk to the top and back quite quickly but the wonderful thing is that you are given plenty of time to enjoy the experience! It's not one of these tourist attractions that rushes you to the top, tells you to get your photo then get out. Oh no! You have an excellent amount of time here to relax, enjoy the views and just be happy that you decided to come. The climb itself isn't steep. There's one small section where you have to go up vertical ladders (you are not exposed, you will not fall off the bridge!)but for the most part the stairs are gradual and you take so many breaks anyway that it is not tiring. You also have a safety line attached to you, so there is nothing to worry about. There are no big gaps under your feet or any other terrifying features, it's all perfectly safe and secure.You can't take anything up with you in case you drop it, including cameras. You can buy photos that your guides takes of you along the way. Special shout out to my guide Tom who was an absolute legend! Within minutes he knew everybody's names, calling us in throughout the tour!! He was genuine and I really couldn't have asked for a better guide. I had pre-booked a 10 photograph package so he took plenty for me! Again, it wasn't like, okay it's a photo stop, I take one photo then move on, no! If you wanted to do lots of poses, that was fine! He also took some landscape ones without me in them as I really like those, what a guy!I got 10 photos for I think $55/60. You either get these printed, on a CD or for $5 I got them on a USB stick. You can also buy individual ones, I think these cost $15 so it works out well to get 10. There were 4 photo stops so you get the opera house in the background, the city, the harbour etc. You can also take a 10 second video at the top of the bridge (no additional cost). Everyone gets a group photo to takeaway included in the cost. There are 4 times of day you can book this for: dawn, day, twilight and night. I booked night but as it's the summer I got a bit of twilight into night. All I can say it wow, night is amazing! The city sparkles, the opera house is lit up! You also don't have the sun blaring down at you, making you hot and uncomfortable. I picked night as it was the cheapest option but honestly I think it must give the best views.All I can say is it was honestly the best thing I did in Sydney. If I ever come back one day with friends who wanted to do it, I would be happy to spend the money and do it again, it's just that good!To the BridgeClimb team, guys keep doing what you're doing! The experience is amazing and I honestly cannot think of any way for you to improve it."

The cheapest option to get an impression of the scale is to simply walk across, and possibly continue down below the northern end for some impressive city views from the water's edge with the bridge dominating overhead. For views from high up, consider the Pylon Lookout rather than the Bridge Climb. You get 90% of the views for less than 10% of the price! The lookout is located in the south-easternmost of the 4 support pylons, i.e. the one closest to the City (duh).Been there several times over the years.Enjoy."

Yes I sat in the office with fear taking over - I'm not good with heights at all. Went along with the briefing and getting all the safety wear on - even did the trial part where you climb a set of steps in the climb office to familiarise yourself with how to manage the safety rope. Before I knew it I was out there and fastened on. I would like to say from there it was plain sailing but no! The first part walking along a narrow platform with cars below was plain scary. Then it was onto the steps, very steep steps. I was ok on them concentration took over then we were on the bridge climb proper. All I can say is this part is a doddle even if you are scared of heights. The walkway is quite wide and solid metal and you walk up the central portion so no fearsome drops to look directly down on. Yes you are high but the views are amazing. Don't think it is strenuous it is fine. I was still frightened on the walkway back but hey I had done it. Please even if you are scared do it- the guides are amazing and talk to you through the headsets giving information on the bridge and construction. I wore my complementary cap with pride all night - Amazing experience!,"

Their website is very clear, contains all the relevant information, and works well - it's a good indication of the whole experience.

Luckily, one can see such views without spending unnecessarily, just by avoiding the tourist traps: namely the Bridge Climb and going up the Pylon Tower. When I was in Sydney last year, I walked from Circular Quay through The Rocks area. On the weekend, this area has a lovely market where you can buy all sorts of things. Walking slightly uphill from this area you can get onto the Harbour Bridge pedestrian walkway, which overlooks Circular Quay, the greater harbour area and of course the Opera House. You can even walk all the way to the other side of the bridge.A perfect example of the phrase \"the best things in life are free\"!"

After that short detour we went up the stairs and walked across the bridge for more spectacular view of the Opera House. Sadly, the Pylon Lookout was closed (we did the walk during Christmas day) so we weren't able to go inside..there is a fee of AUD$13 which I am thinking would be worth it.

If you do the climb you can't take your camera with you, but the guide takes photos of everyone at different stages of the climb.You receive free entry to the Pylon Lookout where you can take your own photos.

The staff undertaking the pre-climb training and guiding the climb were professional, safety conscious, knowledgeable and informative. The climb took about 3 hours and was suitable for people of a reasonable fitness level. We commenced our climb at 7pm (December) during daylight as we commenced the climb and progressing to dusk and then darkness as we reached the climb summit. this provided us with fantastic photographs in particular the photograph at the climb summit with Sydney City lights and the Sydney opera house lit in the background. We would certainly recommend this experience to anyone who is visiting Sydney. What a buzz....."

            "review": "Harbour Bridge Climb. Climbing the Harbour Bridge probably isn't top of the 'To Do' list for people who avoid heights, but to my surprise, I didn't really feel nervous during the climb. I did spend time looking at the web site and familiarising myself with what to expect and reading lots of reviews, especially ones from people in my (pushing 70) age group. Other people have written everything that can be said about how good the climb, the guides and the view are, so I will just add a couple of minor points. If the day is warm, do leave your top as well as your shorts/slacks in your locker. If you have prescription glasses and sunglasses, it's probably easiest to only take one pair because you have a few things attached to your suit and they can get into a bit of a tangle - your glasses, cap, ear phones and headband style torch if you are going to be on the bridge after sunset. I didn't find the climb difficult and would describe myself as moderately fit -mostly you climb at a moderate pace with frequent stops. There are some drinking fountains along the climb. Also, to be very basic, you away from the toilet for at least 3 hours, so some might find it best not to drink too much before starting out! It is a really enjoyable experience, so just relax and enjoy it!"

Simply walking across the bridge and taking in the site along the way. The other option is to actually pay a bit and you get to climb over the bridge. This is for those adrenaline junkies who would love a bit of sweating and physical activity as part of their sightseeing regime. Not for both these options there is a third one which involves a ferry ride and travelling underneath the bridge."

Planned to be in Sydney on New Year's eve to watch the 'oh so famous fireworks'. So disappointing. I never could. Reached early in the day around 1 pm n the place was quite crowded already. We tried to find a place for about 4 hours but the security staff(all middle eastern, paki or indian) would move us from wherever we sat. Racism was rampant in the staff. Nothing was being said to the ppl who had taken up lots of space. In such an event where ppl turn up from all over the world to watch such a hyped(yes, just a hype) event, paying large sums of money, the security shouldn't harass anyone. But it seems that these ppl wanted to please their white bosses that they are good workers by being violent and hostile to Asians. We are very well travelled ppl and very cooperative(more than required). Still, this treatment has put us off and we never ever plan to come back to Australia. I am so disappointed that being here in this city at this time(11:40pm) I am writing this review sitting in my room. I feel for those who still undergoing the ordeal there at the Harbour. This is also due to mismanagement as their was no clear marking for sitting areas, evacuation areas or passageways and the security staff was doing what they pleased. In this situation, visitors often come back before the fireworks as I saw many of them doing. And security seems to be pleased as against trying to make them comfortable and enjoy their city's celebrations. I hope they stop venting their frustrations on poor tourists and treat everyone equally. Racist ppl!! Just ruined my holiday and Anniversary as well."

But the best way to enjoy it, is to get to a place near it on the other side, all i can tell is i was close to Jeffery street. A locality with beautiful old houses, prime location according to those that live in the city. You could walk under it, where the stone pillars support it, see and hear the commuting trains go by. Watch the locals playing pingpong, relax on garden chairs and watch the passenger ships going past the bay, all in very uncrowded very relaxed surroundings. Caution to all those new , make sure you wear clothes that protect you from strong winds. It really gets nippy. I always like to follow the local culture and see what the locals do, and this is one of it, rather than being like a tourist and walk on the bridge between a bustling expressway, a shuddering rattling commuting train and no time to just draw the entire beauty of it all in. What can i say, to each its own way, but I'm the kind of person who like to take time, and enjoy everything and from a different perspective than the usual tourist. And i did.so for those who would like to, please do enjoy this monumental feat by going where i did."

Once you're up there it's really like climbing the broadest, shallowest set of stairs you can imagine. It is true there are some steep ladders to traverse and some issues with limited access. However the staff and the organisers have done absolutely everything possible including attaching you to a harness and give your foul weather gear to make sure that you enjoy your experience.The interest isn't just limited to the walk, the visitors centre boasted an impressive mini-museum dedicated to the bridges construction and it's impact on Sydney and the country. the staff were friendly and helpful, their processes making sure you are 100% prepared for the climb and safe to do so.This is all about standing atop a world icon and saying \"I've done that.\" You get to do that with places like this, the Eiffel tower and the Empire State building (2/3 achieved), and the experience fulfilled my desire completely.On a more practical note. Everyone is breathalysed before being allowed to climb the bridge. I made the mistake of taking a drink earlier and wasn't admitted. The staff were very helpful and we re-scheduled for the following night. Obviously I knew I couldn't climb paraletic, but I'd only had the one beer and the margins for climbing are obviously extremely narrow. Have that celebratory drink on the way down."

Excellent,a bit unsure whether I could manage the walk and the height,so glad I did,one of the best experiences of my life.Climbing up through the structure was'nt too bad,a bit tight height wise in places for me but Rob the leader of the group ensured I was ok every 2 minutes until we got out onto the main bridge structure,from there to the top was a relatively easy walk on quite a broad girder,you could not see through the metal work into the harbour but the views out over the harbour area were spectacular.Suiting up and the safety talk takes 40 minutes and about 30 on your return,so you spend approx 2-2.30 hours actually on the bridge or the ladders,at the top group photo taken followed by individual or couples have their photo taken.Wonderful experience,bought the t shirt as well so I can dine out on this for years to come!"

One can also get up on to the end towers for free. But to get on top of the bridge the price is hefty."

Walk down the street at Milsons Point to Luna Park, and take a ferry back to Circular Quay. A great addition to your Sydney stay!

Would I get nervous and chicken out? Would the height and standing over the harbor from such a dizzying height cause me to fall off the bridge? All these things and more kept going through my mind ... but I still wanted to try. ...and I am so glad I did! They take care of everything as soon as you get there, are very careful to test you out and get you familiar with what you must prepare for. They have made every effort to make it as safe as getting out of bed. So if you are having doubts, let them go. Just go ahead and climb that old bridge and have the time of your life! The views, the experience, and the satisfaction of knowing you have done it are worth every second you have spent worrying about doing it. ...and for most of us, it will be a once in a lifetime experience, so just go do it!"

When you fly into Sydney, you can see it from the sky and it gives you that warm fuzzy feeling of a place that you belong. It distinguishes your place - North Shore vs. Eastern Suberbs vs. West vs. Where-ever else. For me, this sight is so much more than a bridge. So much more than the history that defines the city. So much more than the sad story of lives lost while building was completed. It's the road to the city and the structure the brings us 'North Shore' types into the hyper-activity of the city offerings. It's the ride home after an intense meeting, day in the office or a booze fueled all-nighter. It's the source of fireworks that light the sky for various occasions. It's a place for city workers to take a lunch-time run and loose themselves. It's the pathway for tourists to stop, take photos and see the highlights of this place that I now call 'home'."

Being an aussie who lived overseas for so many years, these iconic landmarks(Opear house, Uluru etc.) hold a special place in my heart. They are symbols of home.I did the bridge climb on a beautiful sunny day, and the view atop the bridge is breathtaking. Apart from the stunning view, which some claims the same as what you get at the rooftop bar somewhere, the most impressive feature of the bridge climb is the detailed explanation of the history and engineering of the bridge. The guide we had was very professional and passionate about his job but not over the top. Other staff we had contact with were all very helpful and friendly. The safety procedures and the use of equipment were explained so you feel safe. The climb itself was not difficult, except that some people might feel uneasy at the steep ladder section with narrow steps.Overall a very enjoyable experience. Now, the tourist trap! You are not allowed to take camera or mobile phone onto the bridge so we stopped at 3 different spots for everyone to have their photo taken individually plus a group photo. At the end of the tour you have to walk through the counter selling photos of you with the one and only world-famous Opear House in the background. And who could resisit it when seeing a very happy self so close and personal to the riveting steel structure of Harbour Bridge? Or was the photo atop the bridge 134-metre above the sea level more representative of your bridge clime experience? What about the nice people you share the day with whom you would never see again? Well, you only need ONE \"$15\" photo to commemorate and to prove your bridge climb experience so don't buy more. Seriously, the best souvenir is the momory of the day.Tip, check weather forecast. They are quite flexible with your appointment as tours are quite frequent."

You can walk across the pedestrian / street level and get just as good of view and take pictures with your camera...so, there's your amazing views on camera.

If you go for the night climb be prepared for finishing VERY late! I did the Twilight climb and I only left the bridge after 10pm and since I was alone I did not feel great walking out alone to catch the train at that time.The photographs are also so expensive so I really think they could put more effort into creating value for the customers.The views from the top of the bridge are beautiful but it sucks that you cannot take pics and the pics they take are so expensive! The climb is really easy but for elders the steps might be a bit stressful. If you're an adrenaline junkie then this will not scratch your itch so your money will be better spent elsewhere."

We have lived in Sydney for 4 years and never got round to doing the bridge climb until family came over from the UK and suggested we did it.I wasn't nervous about the climb and i'm not particularly scared of heights but as we set off the butterflies kicked in and once we were walking over the road before we started to climb I did get a bit panicky..... I think because the pathway was narrow and you could see below my mind took over and I did question myself if I needed to go back!! after expressing my thoughts with my mother we decided to not look down and press on. We then came to the stairs which we climbed one at a time and waited in turn, I did question the girl a staff member who assisted with groups going up if it gets any easier as I was struggling with the height and the vertical view directly below, she assured me the worst was done and the next level was 3 times as wide and not see through below. I am glad I persisted as all my nerves disappeared and the experience then became an enjoyable one and I was able to relax and get stuck in to the experience. The walkway up was wide and I felt totally confident.Our guide was very good and provided confidence throughout, he was very knowledgable and fun.We originally wanted a day trip but due to other commitments we did the night climb and I believe for us it was better and far more impressive.If you don't fancy the climb I would highly recommend a trip up the Pylon which also has amazing views. If you have family or friends doing the climb they will also get free tickets to go up the Pylon which is great for taking pictures if you time it right with the climbers."

Pace is leisurely (takes about 3 hours in all) so plenty of time for a rest in between. Not difficult, I feel most people could manage it. I was lucky in that the weather was ideal, not too hot and sunny, not windy or raining. If weather not 100% suitable a climb of the lower part of the bridge is done, though the higher climb, which I did, is the best. Also included is a visit to the pylons, the structures either end of the bridge, which also gives a great view of the harbour. If the whole thing gets too much there is the option to leave on the way up about half way - there are staff there to guide you down. Though no-one on my tour took this option."

It is a 3.5 hour tour, but at least an hour of that time was safety instruction (which was boring but necessary). You are put in a group of 10 people with groups leaving about every 20 minutes so there is always a group in front of you and behind you, which made the climb slower then I would have liked (you have to wait for the group a head of you to take pictures and move before you can proceed, so there was a lot of standing around time). You each have a headset so you have no problem hearing the group leader and the only time I was scared was having to climb down ladders to get back to the starting point. Otherwise, the view was incredible and we loved the experience.Only downside is that you cannot take a camera, so we ended up buying the pictures they take and sell to you at the end of the climb (it was a once in a lifetime experience for us so we splurged on a complete packet of photos). I had also gone by the day before to make sure the shoes I had were OK to climb in - I was told yes and of course the day of the climb I was told no - but they did provide me with a comfy pair of shoes to borrow."

It has an internal staircase which provides access to a secure viewing platform neat the top, and also houses a fascinating museum of how the bridge was built - for those who are so inclined.It is very inexpensive and provides stunning views.

The whole experience was very professional, from the initial induction and history of the bridge, to the climb completion. The climb itself was not too taxing (I am in my 60's) and the views were spectacular with a 360 degree view of Sydney and its' harbour and of the bridge itself. The view of the sunset in the west and later the city at night was well worth the climb on their own, we even saw a shooting star whilst at the bridge top! The safety harnesses and couplings were not really a hinderance either. A great experience, not to be missed by Sydney siders as well as visitors to Sydney."

The guide gives a very good briefing and you have a test ladder just before the actual climb. They go fairly slowly with stops for views and stories of the bridge and Sydney. You take nothing except your shoes ..they even give you their handkerchief and cap tied on!A draw back is no cameras, but the guide takes pictures and a video of you individually, so allow an extra $50 to buy them afterwards!! And then allow time (an hour) to afterwards climb the Bridge Pylon (included in the price) and get your panoramic photos of Sydney Harbour. Make sure you toilet stop before trip! 3 hours with no opportunities!!"

Sydney s oldest buildings in the Rocks area are right below you and you can watch the aircraft coming and going to the airport only a few kilometres away.Theres nothing better than a boozy lunch in one of the great Puba around the Harbour.

Took some splendid photos, you can go up one of the towers a fee applies about $aus 13, with reset it had just closed .It is quite a climb up from the main city neR to the rocks district ,but well worth it.

But I can recommend other, cheaper experiences that give you a sense of the scale and place of the Bridge. You can walk across the Bridge on a pedestrian lane; and you can ride across on a train or bus or hire car. Ferries headed west will take you under the Bridge. From Luna Park (fun fair) at Milsons Point you can look up and see lots of the Harbour Bridge, just as you can from many other waterside venues and grassed reserves. If you are exploring The Rocks and west side of Circular Quay you can get close to a massive pylon. And if you go to the Art Gallery of NSW you can find artworks from the early 1930s showing the construction of the Bridge. There are also plenty of publications containing photos (old and recent) and facts."

Recommendation: if you like to exercise, take an afternoon and go for a long run that takes you across the Harbour Bridge. The pedestrian entrance is a bit hard to find--its in the Rocks neighborhood--basically just follow the signs for the Bridge Walk, and you'll get there. One side is reserved for bikes and the other for pedestrians. The sidewalk is wider than I expected and easily accommodated walkers, runners, and sightseers. When you reach the other side (i.e., the non-CBD side), make sure you take time to explore the riverside park--it offers great views of the CBD, Harbour Bridge, and Opera House. One of those landmarks that defines Sydney!"

If you visit Sydney you must try the bridge climb experience, and of the options we went for the twilight climb, so we see Sydney Harbour in all its glory both during the daylight going up, and the evening coming down.The climb itself is not strenuous so is suitable for all of the able bodied, and the guides take you through the history of the bridge, as well as some very entertaining stories relating to the heroic builders and the two openings (one unofficial) of the bridge. You'll get the chance to perchase plenty of photos of your walk as you cant cary any objects on the bridge climb itself."

Walk up Argyle st and look for stairs and the large Pylon supporting the road leading to the actual bridge itself.It is a long walk but well worthwhile, safe and good views with photo taking made fairly easy. Security guards patrol the bridge, so very safe. You get good photos of the City, Circular Quay and the Opera House, that you can't get as good from the ground. One bridge Pylon has a climb facility to get higher up for a moderate cost. Then of course there is the more expensive bridge climb but that is not for me as I don't like heights that much. It is safe but that does not help me LOL :-) Allow 2 hours to do this ."

We thoroughly enjoyed driving over it and admiring it's beauty from Circular Quay and the Opera House.We were so disappointed though when our family made our way on foot to the bridge with the intention of walking across it and after getting up two flights of steps, carrying the pram up security turned us away and told us that we weren't allowed to walk across it as it was 'too dangerous' with a pram. We got told the ramps that were next to the stairs were so people could ride their bike across the bridge. The Bridge itself is wonderful, however it's so disappointing that we were discriminated against because we had a pram, especially if it's ok for bikes to go across it. People in wheelchairs would be treated the same way and for an icon which has been around for so long, it's disappointing that they're so behind with the times.The Bridge needs to be more family friendly."

From the moment you enter the climb building the staff are friendly and you know you are going to be in for a great experience. You don't feel rushed and part of a cattle market that so often tourist attractions feel like, the whole experience takes about 3 hours and you spend a good 2 hours on the bridge. Our guide was brilliant - funny and knowledgeable without being over bearing, you learn lots about the history of the bridge and the city and of course get some incredible views. Treat yourself to this experience in Sydney (the twilight climb is great as the city is light when you walk up but lit up by the time you come back down and the pictures look great)"

This Bridge Climb crews are outstanding and the preparation that they go through for your safety is better than I have ever seen. I think they could do this anywhere in the world including the US without any issues.Secondly, once you are at the top, well it has been said thousands of times, there are none better in all of Sydney because you worked a little to get it and not everyone who goes to Sydney will ever have that same experience. Simply amazing.Pros: Safe, great training process and equipment, fantastic guides and several of them, absolutely beautiful views of city and harbor, amazing experience.Cons; Only one, but like much of Sydney it is pretty expensive. Not really a con, but you don't really cross the bridge, you go to the top, cross at midpoint and come back on the other side of the same span (the distance is the same as crossing the bridge)Would I do it again, without a doubt, the bridge climb is a must to experience Sydney."

It had been a hot day so we thought that would be better as it would be cooler and we could see the night lights. Plus it was the least expensive time to go. We were thrilled with the experience. All the staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and most helpful. We were disappointed to learn it took 3 and a half hours and couldn't imagine why. We didn't realize first hour is preparation and that we would make a lot of stops along the way. This worked beautifully (pun intended) as it gave us plenty of time to enjoy the beauty and kept us from being fatigued at all. It was a very safe experience and our guide did a great job of telling us the history of the bridge. While it seems like it would be a significant physical challenge, it was not. If you have only modest conditioning, you will be fine. If this is not on your bucket list, add it NOW! Two things I wish were different: really would like to bring my own camera and I wish it was not as expensive."

Designed by Bradfield, not only is it a magnificent structure but it is the perfect viewing platform for one of the prettiest harbours in the world. Walking across the bridge is said to add a year to the length of your life. From the walkway you can see Sydney's other icon, the Opera House. You can safely cross from South to North or vice versa either on foot or via bicycle. The bicycle track begins near the Sydney Observatory at the Rocks (home of Sydney's oldest English settlement) and ends at Milson's Point. The walking track ends in Kirribilli (a 10 minute wander to see the sometime home of the Australian Prime Minister.) The view from the bridge is spectacular and unencumbered. Well worth it.My daughter and I once took a train to Milson's Point, walked .across the bridge, went to the Markets at the Rocks, ate at Pancakes on the Rocks, went to Manly via the ferry at Circular Quay. We swam then ate dinner at one of the many restaurants at Manly. Then took the ferry back to the Quay. What a lovely day."

Since I have traveled a lot of India and Europe, and I was visiting this third continent - Australia for the first time, I did have a basic expectation of finding something worthwhile, especially because even the hemisphere was different. But to be very frank, Sydney was a big disappointment for me, as without any culture of their own, and overly planned city, it looked and felt too bland. And harbor bridge and Opera house were another reason for my disappointment. My experience with Eiffel Tower in the day light was a similar one, but at night the sight totally changed and was extremely attractive. But i did not feel the same for the harbor bridge and the opera house area. it is hopelessly crowded and in the normal days, even the lights are not that attractive. So much so for one of the most livable city in the world!!! Trust me if ppl can, but India and Europe are far more beautiful and \"living\"."

It's gorgeous!!We did not do the Climb, but we did walk across (for free) and were able to take lots of photos of the Opera House from the Bridge, it's the best spot for a photo op for sure!! I definitely recommend walking across the bridge, you might regret it if you don't!"

Plenty of people do the bridge walk, which I believe is expensive & does look amazing, but that was not for me, too high! However pay $13 & you can go up one of the viewing towers which gives spectacular views. I would recommend doing this, as the walk along the bridge is good but views are obviously obstructed with all the railings."

I was unsure about the feelings of being so high and the steepness of the climb but, felt safe at all times completely surrounded and firm under foot with a harness too (There is NO chance you could fall or slip). The steepness was not an issue either as, it is a slow climb with plenty of stops to rest and take in the view. The worst part is the rather prolonged saftey talk before climbing, but made worthwhile with the fantastic view when you get to the top. Photo's are a bit cheesy but fun and proof you did it."

What else can I say except that it was AWESOME!!The whole experience was amazing. The instructors go through every aspect of the climb, and talk you through the whole thing. Once we were all geared up the nerves started kicking in. Probably the scariest part was walking out to the bridge along the mesh walkway. After that, everything else was a breeze.We walked up and through one of the pylons (which is an awesome experience in itself) it was like stepping back into the 1930's. Once we got to the underside of the bridge, we walked up through the street level and up onto one of the arches. This may take a little effort, like walking up a ladder. Then once we were on top of the arch, it was a simple, uphill stroll, up and over the arch. Just a note here, the arch is very, very wide. Standing on the arch, you cannot see straight down. I would say the arch is about 2.5 to 3.0 meters wide. So if you have a fear of heights like I do then don't worry, it is wide enough to think you are on the ground. There are plenty of great photo opportunities for photos to be taken by the guide, which you can buy for a fee. (sorry, no cameras) Having said that, when we got to the top, the walkway between the arches is a bit thinner, but by this time we were all used to being up there. A bit scary for some. Then we descended on the other arch and went back the way we came.All in all, an awesome experience and one that everyone should do at least once in their lifetime. That goes for us Sydney-siders as well. A must do experience for everyone, highly recommended."

While it's perfectly functional as a bridge, it excels at combining the thrills of a mid city climb with the spectacular views of a harbour city in all it's glory. Prepare yourself, the Harbour Bridge Climb is neither cheap nor for the faint hearted. But if you can rally your pennies and your courage, you will have the experience of a life time. The whole experience lasts about 3 hours ( they dress and prep you before the climb) and is completely safe. You are tethered at all times and apart the walk underneath the deck (that you can see the traffic move beneath) it's more awe inspiring that scary. Actually ... i'm lying. If you're scared of heights ... you're going to love this. If, however, the height is too much ... then try walking across. Start at North Sydney and walk back to the city. The walk is pleasant and the view is lovely. You will end up in the rocks .. .and there you will find pubs. Lots of them. And lets face it ... you deserve a drink. Especially if you've done the climb first !!!"

Based on a suggestion from friends who live there, we took the train in from the suburb where we stayed and got off on the north side of the Bridge. This allowed us to walk across it and \"get up close and personal' (about a 20-30 minute walk). We were able to take some wonderful pictures of the Opera House and Circular Quay area. Our time was somewhat limited so we decided to forego the climb (takes 3-4 hours) and instead go up the Pylon Lookout. It's a couple hundred steps to the top or almost 300 feet. This allows for great pictures of several kilometres of surrounding Sydney (you can't take pictures while doing the Bridge Climb!). There are several stops going up the Pylon that provides a fascinating story of how it was constructed. Whatever you decide to do in the Bridge area, you won't regret it!"

Pity as we have many reviews from our time there. Anyway, I thought we would write this one as it was very special. First of all, the walk itself is over 3 hours long as you walk up one side, then cross over at the top and walk down the other side. The walk starts with a briefing and questionnaire, followed by a breathalyzer test to make sure you are not worse for wear. A very good idea indeed. Then you get undressed and dressed in their boiler suits and all the accoutrements that go with your walk. Even having attachments for your glasses and peak caps so as not to fall off. After this it is into the practice arena for practicing attaching to each other and the safety hand rails. All of this is completed under the watchful eyes of the professional guides who answer all your questions with pride. Once all this is done, then the walk starts along gantries and ladders for quite a time until you reach the base of the bridge. Half way up and at the top, the guide takes photos of you all (approx10 persons are allowed in each party at any one time). All the time the guide is giving you running commentary on the various view points and history that goes with it through the headsets that you all have attached. As I said, this all takes over 3hours but it is so worth it and never forgotten even if one of the best things was that my husband is terrified of heights but still managed to accomplish this epic task. One other thing, and that is that the New Year fireworks are fantastic but everywhere in Sydney goes up in price and to get near the bridge is very very difficult as most of the streets etc are blocked off. Another option and one that we did was to go there for Australia Day 26 January and the Chinese New Year when there are many more firework displays to watch (especially the one in Darling Harbour). There are also many more street parties and parades and it is also a great deal cheaper. Lastly, although the bridge walk is expensive, a lot of this was due to the exchange rate at the time which has actually increased to date but the experience is well worth the trouble."

Then they eventually after going round in circles agreed a refund, but couldn't because there card machine didn't work! Then maybe you could email us and well arrange a refund!!Eventually we had a cash refund! Our last evening in Sydney ruined spending nearly 2 hours achieving this!!"

Saying that if you fear heights you can do this. It's not scary at all and the safety employed by the bridge operation is amazing. Tour guides are really great and friendly. My sister has a fear of heights and she was fine. The view spectacular. If you can stomach the price DO IT. Failing that it's free to walk across the bridge and back. That takes about 30mins. Fairly easy walk. There is some stairs to get to walk way that the elderly May find challenging. But it is doable. And you can take some good shots. For a smaller fee you can climb the pillions. You actually get a free pass when you do the bridge climb. Pillion climb is challenging."

It takes at least three hours of your time, but you will appreciate the preparation (emphasis on safety) that they put you through - everything is oriented toward making the entire event memorable and you are not rushed through like a Disney ride. Both my wife and I are over 65 years old and we had no trouble on the climb - so do it!"

Scariest part (for me) were the ladders from the lower deck to the span (both up and down). But crossing the span is a no-brainer! This one is FOR the feint of heart! Spectacular views of the Opera House, harbor, etc. And it's a very close walk to Lord Nelson's Pub afterwards for a first class beer! The tour is a bit pricy even for Aussie dollars but it is VERY safe and the guides are wonderful. Mitch was fantastic and funtastic!"

Sydney Harbour Bridge is iconic and what a better way to see Sydney than perched high above the traffic of the bridge looking down over the majestic harbour and its foreshore. The climb takes about 2 hours or alternatively you can walk across the bridge from City (east) to North Sydney (North) 30mins. Both will be exhilarating, one more expensive than the other and most notably the climb more memorable than the walk. I highly recommend booking well in advance for Bridge Climb and be sure to choose a day session rather than night as more can be seen from afar."

Our hotel the four seasons an excellent hotel by the way overlooked the bridge and we thought about our booked clime every time we looked at the bridge. On the day of our climb we arrived and got prepared, the staff are very professional and dedicated to your safety, the briefing and getting kitted up take just over an hour, they are very safety conscious with the gear you put on and even do a trial ladder climb to ensure you are comfortable. You are secured to a safety line before you leave the centre and this continues until your back at this point on your return. Once you are out from under the bridge structure and clime the near vertical ladders through the bridge deck up onto the main span, this in my view is the most difficult part it is easy the rest of the way to the top of the bridge. You stop a couple of times for photos and admire the many views of the harbour and city then in no time you are at the top. When you cross over at the top to descend down the other side it can be a bit unnerving looking down to the traffic below. Overall it's a very well organised tour and worth doing if you have travelled a long way to Sydney and a once in a life time trip."

We had a guide who has worked there since the beginning (Guy) and he was fantastic and full of so much information. The guides take photos of each group within their group at several points on the bridge, plus you receive one of the entire group that is included in the cost of the climb. You are able to purchase a USB stick with 10 photos of yourselves on it, plus 4 generic photos thrown in, which were a pleasant surprise. I really cannot recommend it highly enough.

There are two option the regular and the express. If you want or need a slow pace the regular is your best choice. It takes three plus hours and the pace is easy. We are avid hikers and for us it was not enough exercise. On the other hand if this is your first climb I would recommend this option because the commentary the guide provided was interesting and informative and he was also quite funny. I imagine the express climb is for second timers or those who do want the exercise.Just a few more thoughts. I don't like heights but I never felt uncomfortable in the slightest way. The operators take a lot of care to insure your safety. The gear is top rate and clean. You actually have to change out of your clothes and into a bridge jump suit. You are very close to the oldest part of Sydney, take the time after the climb for lunch at the Hero of Waterloo (cool pub)."

Ride the City Rail to Milson's Point in time for the sunset. It was around 5p.m when we visited early July as it was winter there. It is a good time to experience the sunset and changing colors over the Sydney Opera House as well as Sydney Harbour. Great views from there of the left side of the Opera Theatre wing and right side of the Concert Hall. Allow about 1/2 hour to walk across as taking photos make occupy some additional time. It is free admission and you make walk at your own pace with the company of many others as well as bicyclists. If you start from Milson's Point, you will end up in the Rocks area of Sydney. A great walk to enjoy the skyline of Sydney as well. Must do."

Photographers - a shot taken from the park on the North Western side will give you an excellent shot of the bridge itself AND the opera house and harbour beyond. Don't ignore the underside of the bridge also as the steel work etc is quite spectacular. The best general view though is standing in front of the opera house looking west. Do the bridge climb if you can, you won't regret it I promise you or you can't climb to the top of the south east pylon which is almost as good (and free!!). Finally check out the view of the bridge and the north side of the harbour from the rotunda on Observatory Hill."

You tour with groups of 12 with people from all over the world -- you actually become a little team. The views are spectacular. I don't think I would recommend this tour with those who fear heights --- but you certainly do feel secure and safe on this tour. Loved every minute and well worth the $228 USD fee per person.

We saved this until last and were so glad we did.The experience lasts a good three and half hours. Forty five minutes of that is orientation and preparation before hooking on and beginning the climb.Our tour guide (Scott) was extremely knowledgeable, enthusiastic and helpful. From the ground the climb looks quite steep. However it is a very easy climb even for those of us that are out if shape. There are plenty of stops and water breaks so no need to worry.We opted for the ten photo package. You also get a free group shot and eight second video clip in with the climb.Do this if you're in Sydney, you won't regret it."

I lived for ten years looking across the water from the Harbour Bridge but, after many years back in the UK, started to visit Sydney again. A lot of things have changed .. not all for the better ... but the Harbour Bridge is everything you want in a bridge and walking across the top of it is the icing on the cake. It's jaw droppingly expensive but a once in a lifetime experience. I'm not brilliant at heights but there is nothing to fear - safety is very well catered for. Most disappointing aspect is that cameras are forbidden and the official photos are pretty hopeless .. so photographic memories are in short supply."

Undoubtedly there would not be a single tourist that has visited Sydney who has not taken a photo of the world reknown, Harbour Bridge. This being the case, as a tourist in Sydney I thought I would take my share. The bridge dominates the Sydney landscape to such an extent that it is almost impossible to ignore it. From the moment we approached Sydney from the air, the bridge appeared as a striking feature. From ground/water level, it's dimensions are awesome. Walking under it and driving over it, you can't help but be impressed with the engineering that went into the construction. From the vantage point of the rooftop terrace of the Rocks YHA, we were able to observe numerous groups make the intrepid journey up the main span of the bridge, to stand below the massive flags that flutter from the highest mid-point of the bridge. On this visit, watching was the bravest we got, but a 'walk' is on the bucket list for the future."

We finally get to see if we are afraid of heights.Many months ago, while we where still at the planning stage, I put today's activity at the top of my list. It's finally here.Today, we climb the bridge. Believe it or not, we set out nice and early for a change and arrived at the location in time for the 9.00am climb. We were given a breathalyser test and asked to complete health and safety forms. Once these had been completed we were given our jumpsuits (not a good choice of words considering the heights we would be scaling today) and hats.We were then given utility belts that housed our harnesses and radios. When we were done, we looked like members of a comedy swat team. We had a practice climb on a set of steps and ladders and then we were off.All around us were photos of the numerous celebrities that had made the climb before us.Robert De Niro, Matt Damon, Will Smith, Will Ferrell and even Harry Potter who apparently chose to climb and pay the \u00a3120, even though he could have flown up on his Nimbus 3000.The climb took us through narrow timber walkways with cars passing us over head.Below us the water glimmered in the early morning sun and a train road to our right as it shook the bridge. The ascent took approximately 2 hours and the views from the top were well worth the effort. The massive natural harbour stretched out in every direction. We arrived at the top just in time to observe a minutes silence directly beneath the half mast flags at the summit of the bridge. We had climbed the bridge and reached it's pinnacle at 11 minutes past 11 on the 11th of the 11th. It was an eerie moment as we stood in silence at what felt like the top of the world.We posed for some photographs (such a shame that you couldn't take up your own camera), before finally setting off back down. The trip down is a little trickier as you are walking above the cars and trains and can be a little unsettling. Annette did prefer the trip up to the one back down and her legs began to shake.She was informed that it was due to a build up of lactic acid at the back of her legs and the only known cure was to have two ice cold beers (one for each leg) on her arrival back down. At least we know we are not scared of heights."

The company that developed the climb has installed a very sophisticated system of harnesses and cables all along the route that takes you up to the highest point which in itself is pretty amazing. Apart from this you are just walking along the top of the bridge which isn't as difficult as it is made out to be. The views from the top are spectacular though and worth the effort.

She took great photos of the group and individual photos looking over the Opera House and the summit of the bridge.Just to make people aware it is loud underneath the bridge due to road traffic and trains. If you get a chance when in Sydney definitely do the bridgeclimb"

The preparation takes quite some time, they give you a breathalyzer before you begin the setup, so watch the beers before you go...or you wont be going. They give you head lamps & jumpsuits for warmth. But to be up there & see the views from the Opera House to Darling Harbor at night is just amazing.

The pylons stand sentinel on both sides of the harbour and viewing it from underneath on a ferry is something special.

My wife & I have scaled the bridge twice & on the first climb she got 'stuck' (she had, until this excursion, been afraid of heights). Within seconds a member of staff appeared from nowhere & skillfully encouraged her to continue. When we arrived back at ground level our 'team' gave her a big round of applause.

My husband got to go on his \"climb\" over the Sydney Harbour Bridge while I took an exciting speed boat adventure under the bridge and around Sydney Harbour. We both came back with much to share. 1. My husband was hesitant to go alone and came back so happy with his experience! The climbers were given jumpsuits to wear so that nothing could fall from that height. He was then attached to the bridge so he too was safe :-). The walk/climb over the bridge took about 2 1/2 hours and the pictures from the top vantage point is outrageously fun with all the climbers smiling and waving enthusiastically, as the helicopter flies over and takes their picture. One does not have to be \"in good shape\" to do this climb/walk....just willing to take the time, being able to go up stairs and to be patient as you wait for all the \"walkers\" in your group of 10-12 people. There is much structure to hold on to so no insecurity about one's safety.2. My speed boat trip around the Syndney Harbour was with a group of 10-12 and was exciting with a speed boat that could stop on a dime and turn on that same dime. I was able to stay reasonably dry but was wearing an outfit and shoes that were fit for this occasion on the water. The tour of the Harbour was fantastic and fun on the water was had by all. If you are someone who gets car sick, this is not the experience for you. It is fast moving....a bit on the wild side but I was up for something fun. The weather and water were perfect while the pilot knew his history and historical sites. I wish I could give you the name of this adventure but you can catch this boat trip on the Harbour boat dock, the day you want to go. Go early to be the first in line and sit on one side of these large speed boats or on the other side. The view and experience is more fun with none on both sides of you."

The operation is slick and professional and by the time you start the climb you know you are in safe hands. We had high wind, a burst of heavy rain and sun, but never felt at risk despite the height. They equip you out perfectly. My wife is unhappy at heights but managed it, and the climb is taken at a pace that most can manage. My 65 year old unfit mother-in-law had done it 10 years previously so we were confident we could do it. The views and the experience are unforgettable and we are so pleased we did it. One free photo and a cap comes in the top line price, as well as a 10 second video to post on social media. Extra pictures are about Aus$15. You cannot take anything like your own camera in case it drops! It is a Sydney must do."

We booked a month in advance and whilst we had been recommended to do the sunrise/sunset, this was quite a bit more expensive we opted just to do the standard day tour. The tour lasts for a couple of hours as on arrival, you have a safety talk, need to get suited and booted and toy run through a practice climb of the ladders. With one of our group being nervous of heights, our wonderful climb leader, Albert put us at the front of the group. This meant he was able to check on us and be quite reassuring. You head out onto some very narrow paths which give you the first feel of the climb, before making your way up to some paths where you can see below the 'mesh-like' floor. This is probably the scariest part of the climb as you could see the drop. Four steep ladders later and you were on the main frame of the bridge. With this being solid, it was a bit more relaxed. You take a slow walk up to the top where you are given some wonderful stories by your leader through a radio and headphones. They also take photos of you and your group as you head up. Reaching the top, you have some wonderful views of the harbour and surrounding areas before heading back down the other side of the bridge. It was an amazing experience and we are glad we bought the 10 photo package as it meant we didn't have to be too selective with our choices. I would highly recommend!"

Whether you do a day time tour or my favourite the sunset evening tour it gives you a very special view of the Bridge and Sydney because of it towering heights over Sydney.I have been very lucky to work for the company over many years and had the opportunity to walk across the bridge for free and experienced its glory many times but I never underestimated the beauty and sights I experienced.On our last anniversary and later on our granddaughter\u2019s birthday after I retired I arranged two night tours. Both tours were spectacular and we experienced some of the most incredible sights across Sydney Harbour has to offer. The day time tours are also great, you just don\u2019t get to experience the lights of the ferries, the Opera House and all off those beautiful lights across the city.It is an expensive tour costing about $240 USD but worth every cent and every step that you climb or decline, you experience the bridge and the surrounding city that you would never capture with a camera. You can\u2019t take cameras onto the climb, but included in the price is a tour of the Southern Pylon.The pylon rises about 2/3 of the height of the bridge, gives you incredible views of the city and the harbour bridge and you can take you camera and take as many photos as you wish.The Southern Pylon is accessible from Circular Quay by a ten minute walk through the original and historic Sydney town to the platform of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The price is about $10 USD to walk the 300 steps to the top of the Pylon. The views across Sydney are incredible. You can photograph the Opera House, the Harbour, the Bridge and on a clear all the way out to sea. The Southern Pylon is the cheapest way to view Sydney and also get some great pictures.If you are reading this review, want to visit my city, include the Harbour Bridge Tour as one of your special memories."

The bridge has a separate side for cyclists and so walkers do not need to worry about being run down when stopping to admire the view. If you are not much of a walker and would like to do a one-way walk only, it's best to catch the train from the city to Milsons Point and walk back to the city."

He was very reassuring and his commentary (everyone wears headsets as it's so windy at the top) was great, enough information with being boring and some laughs too! Before you climb you have to change into an all in one 'climbers' suit, and are supplied with a cap and gloves. Before going onto the actual bridge you get to practice inside which is fun and allows you to get used to being attached to a rope. I'd advise to book ahead as it gets very busy, and can be cancelled in bad weather. A must do in Sydney!!"

I did an express climb which meant some great views around the outside of the bridge and an amazing feeling of reaching the top. Albert, the guide was knowledgeable and was great if you were a little afraid of heights. The group I climbed with were lovely and although it was a wet and windy day, it was totally worth it. They kit you out with a climb suit, fleece, beanie, waterproof pants and a raincoat. I was pretty dry and warm! Well worth it!"

At the top of the tower you are about half way up the span of the bridge , you can watch the people doing the climb!!After we walked across the span of the bridge to the other side of the bridge. Then walked through a little place called Kiribilli down to the underside of the bridge. Amazing views.

For $13 you can visit one of the support towers and climb up higher, and for even more you can strap on a harness and climb with other intrepid adventurers up the framework. I was happy to just stay at the lower level and take it all in from there. We did walk towards the end of the day and while there were security guards on the bridge decided we would not be so keen to walk the bridge after dark.

I am biased,as this is my home town.However, I am very well-travelled and often enjoy also being a tourist in my own city, something we all should do, from time to time :)There are many beautiful places in the world to visit...but truly, Sydney is up the top, amongst the most beautiful harbours! Clean, expansive and a vision to sail into! (See for yourself you will likely agree!)Sydney Harbour Bridge is wonderful!I regularly walk across it; enjoy a coffee and walk back home to my suburb of Kirribilli ( also the home of our Prime Minister, when in Sydney...and also our Governor General).There is no fee to walk across the walkway/road on the bridge. (Many city workers walk across it, to their places of employment: some in gym gear, carrying suit-packs etc!)( Do not confuse with walking across the \"span\" of the bridge. This is called the \" BRIDGE CLIMB.\" This is an privately-operated excursion for which there is a cost. )You can walk from either, north side to south side ( Milsons Point to Circular Quay)... or vice versa, in about 15 minutes at a steady walking pace. Do it slowly and it should take no longer than about 30 minutes, even allowing time for photographs, along the way.As you are at a very high elevation, above the harbour, the breeze can be very strong, so a jacket is recommended at all times of the year...though of course, you may need to shed it, mid-walk, in summer. The entrance to the bridge walk ( on the north side) is at Milsons Point (about 100 metres south of the train station entrance) via a steep set of about 50 stairs ( the most difficult part of the walk!) The bridge road walk, itself is quite easy...and oh so enjoyable, apart from traffic whizzing by, though you quickly become oblivious to this as your attention shifts to the magnificent harbour sights...and maybe, the ocean liner, that may be in port.The exit on the south side, is at the back of the historic \" Rocks\" area, ( more stairs) which is adjacent to Circular Quay, a gorgeous and bustling area, which leads along to the \"Sydney Opera House.\" ( There are several quaint and very enjoyable \"pubs\" here as you arrive, should you feel like a beer or so.)Circular Quay, is the busy hub for \"Sydney Harbour Ferries\" which operate the charming cream and green boats that efficiently connect so many beautiful waterfront areas of Sydney, including Manly, Taronga Park Zoo, Parramatta...and further afar. Visitors can easily spend a half day or more enjoying all that Circular Quay area offers: museums, theatres, galleries, street performers, aboriginal musicians and dancers, cafes, restaurants, pubs, bars, souvenir shops etc.Please note: Alcohol is strictly banned on the bridge walkway and foolhardy/risky/dangerous behaviour is also not tolerated. Security staff are stationed along the walkway. Enjoy your walk! Great excursion for all the family!"

Tours book in advance so plan ahead. The walk itself comes after getting into one of the jumpsuits they provide. If it is in the summer, its best to strip down to your underwear before getting into the suit as it can get very warm. There are obviously changing rooms. The walk is not for anyone with a disability or trouble climbing and descending vertical steps (yes straight up) for around 100 steps and several other sections with less steps, but none the less physical requirement. You are wired to a cable, but will be exposed to ledges that give you views straight down several hundred feet, so keep that in mind if you are afraid of heights this will not be for you. If you are of wide girth there are also some tight spots to get through and step over. From the attached picture your climb begins to the far left and you proceed up to the top of the bridge structure, and climb that structure up to the midpoint of the bridge, then cross to the opposite side of the bridge and return down to your point of origin. No cameras are allowed, and only eye/sun glasses are permitted with a provided lanyard. Each group is broken down into about 12 people with a guide in front and back. They do take a personal and group picture for you at the top with the Sydney Opera House in the background. This is an amazing tour, one of the highlights of our trip. It was much more rigorous than we expected, but if you are accustomed to walking and can climb a ladder this will be a highlight of your trip as well. The guides were amazing and very well informed. Don't know how well the picture will show, but if you look closely you can see tour groups at the top of the bridge."

You need to get yourself onto the footpath that crosses the bridge from south going north, and walk about ten minutes until you reach the first pylon ( this is the pylon that is clossest to the Opera house) and from about 10 am to 5 pm you can climb up through the inside of the pylon and come out on the top. The views are still amazing and it won't brake the bank."

They fit you with special jumpsuits, radios and headphones so you can hear your guide. You can't have any cameras or loose objects. They give you lockers to put your things in. You are in a group of about 12-14 people and all of you have individual safety lines hooked to the railing. The guide will take pictures for you and you can purchase them later, You need to be able to climb ladders straight up and climb stairs. They give you a test run in the prep room where you climb a sample ladder and stairs. As the guide narrates, you climb and stop at certain points to enjoy the view. When you reach the top, the guide takes another picture of the group and any individual pictures. Then you cross to the other side and go back down from where you came. The views are awesome!! You can see the cars going by below and the occasional train that run along tracks next to the bridge. It takes about 3 hours total. It is worth every cent! If you want a real adrenaline rush then go for it!!"

We had our trip booked a while and there was a cyclone about so it was a very wet climb, but we just laughed the whole time. WE were given wet gear so we didn't get too wet. The hardest part of the climb was at the beginning to get up to the height, but it was only just that the steps were a little steep but once you started crossing the bridge it was very easy. I thought we were climbing from one side to another, but we only climbed to the centre and then turned back and came back the other side of the bridge. However our guide was great and gave us lots of information and one of the couples got engaged on the very top of the bridge, which was great fun. It was much easier than I expected and we got some great photos taken by the guide. It was a great day out but I thought it was a bit overpriced."

That said, I didn't think it was necessarily that incredible or unique compared to other bridges I've seen. It does offer some nice views of the harbour though. We didn't do the bridge climb, which is time consuming and expensive - but did look cool."

There's a pedestrian walkway on the Opera House side, noting the other (Southern) side is reserved for bicycles, which provides a great view over Circular Quay, the Opera House and the wider harbour. Tip - Should you just want to walk in the one direction, I'd recommend a short ferry ride from Circular across to Jeffereys Street Wharf, then it's just a short walk up through Bradfield Park onto the bridge - noting the view is more impressive on the walk into the city."

Firstly the tour guide takes you all through (group of 12 I think) to get kitted up and do a mock test on ladders inside before heading out onto the bridge. (You can not take any of your belongings with you except any medicine which the guide will keep on them)The bridge climb really is amazing and throughout the tour you all have a RF headset with the tour guide telling you the history of the bridge and it's surroundings. The hardest physical bit of the climb is at the start. Where you are basically climbing a ladder. Throughout the whole climb you are hooked up to a secure steel wire that you cannot detach for safety. There is also always a railing to hold onto.A couple of interesting facts about the bridge based on the tour guides knowledge:\u2022 No safety equipment was used during the erection. You can experience what this felt like by stepping in between the steps near the top onto the rivets of the bridge (this is all they had for grip), really scary to think of being up there without the ladders and no harness!!\u2022 After the workers going on strike for danger money and being refused, the union requested the mayor to climb the bridge to experience what they are up against, he got to the top, looked over the side and basically said \"give them what ever they want!\" They got a 25% rise from that day on. \u2022 16 people died during the erection of the bridge\u2022 Longest single span bridge in the world\u2022 The two towers at the bridge are not there for support - but for cosmetic.The bridge climb also comes with free entry to the look out towers, which if you have time is a nice place to take in the view and take pictures with your own camera. To finalise, the bridge climb is something worth experiencing and I would highly recommend it to anyone capable of doing it."

When you get to the other side, the train station is just off to the right and you can take the train (or catch a bus) back if you've had enough walking."

The population of Sydney, in 1930, was about 1.2 million people. It was a monumental achievement. The bridge connects Milsons Point (a small village with some good eateries) to The Rocks (great pubs and some great restaurants nearby - Circular Quay etc).I have climbed the bridge (Bridge Climb) and was impressed. I climbed the inside arch and got up to the top. The 360 degree perspective of Sydney is awesome. However, if you don't want to splash out on BridgeClimb, then do not worry. You can climb up one of the pylon's. It costs $13.00.It is the distinguishable point of the city. NYE wouldn't be complete without it. Sydney is less of a place without it."

Why anyone would bother with the ridiculously priced Bridgeclimb is beyond me, you can walk the length of the Harbour Bridge anytime you want for free. Granted you are not up as high and the view is somewhat obstructed because of the mesh security wire, but you can still see the whole harbour area and it is so lovely, especially at night. Be warned that the bridge is of course used by buses, trains and cars so it can be somewhat noisy. I like to get the train to Milsons Point and then walk across back to the Circular Quay end, I then walk through the Rocks area and get a coffee. I highly recommend this experience to anyone visiting Sydney."

You take a lift from Circular Quay (on your right when you face the water) and you start walking along Cahill Expressway for quite a long distance before you get on the bridge itself. Along the way there are ample prime spots for taking photos of both the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. The bridge is a long way across (don't underestimate the distance!) and you will be braving strong winds, traffic fumes (plus vertigo for me). However, you will be able to take excellent, unobstructed photos of the Sydney Opera House from the front. Once you reach the other end, you can take the stairs down, cross under the bridge, and make your way to Luna Park where you can take further (still stunning) photos of the two Sydney icons. To finish, you can take the ferry from Milson Point (right next to Luna Park) back to Circular Quay."

We then walked across the bridge and admired the breathtaking views, sharing the deck with both cars and trains. Others would possibly climbed the cables, but that was not for us. We left there and walked along the elevated walkway, over the ferry jetties to get some striking shots of the bridge.

We were given the bridge climb vouchers as birthday presents before we left for Sydney, otherwise I'm not sure I would have booked to do it. I am very unfit and have a dodgy knee so was rather concerned about whether I would make it to the top, and the instructions you get before you set off are so thorough they didn't do much to calm my nerves. But it really isn't too hard at all as you go at such a slow pace with the fantastic guides giving you information all the way. The only part that was quite strenuous was climbing the ladders but there is no rush and it wasn't a problem. Once you get out on to the top of the bridge it is incredible. The views are breathtaking and I could have stayed up there all day just watching everything that was going on below - the traffic whizzing past, the ferries constantly nipping in and out of the harbour, the people including a bride and groom having their wedding pictures taken, the opera house, etc, etc.We had two guides during the trip and they were very informative and really fun. They got the group talking and enhanced the whole experience. There were several stops for photographs, the group one is included in the cost of the climb. Luckily we had some credit from the vouchers we were given and instead of just having to forfeit the difference,we could use it to purchase additional photos, so we have some excellent shots of the three of us. They are almost too good as it looks as though we have been superimposed on a shot of the opera house.Throughout the trip we felt very safe and secure. You are connected at all times by way of a strap, and the outfits and caps (which you get to keep), and all the accessories are well designed. There are a couple of water fountains on the walk if you get thirsty.Altogether an excellent experience."

This way the whole vista of the city opens up in front of you.

The whole experience was very well organized, from filling out the paperwork and doing a breathalizer test, to the issuing of their equipment and clothing, down to the preliminary obstacle course (which simulates all the different types of obstacles you'll encounter on the bridge). This part takes about an hour but if you don't feel comfortable or change your mind during this time, you can. I think that's why it's so organized and can be lengthy. During the climb, the guide/photographer snapped photos my group individually and with us as a group. When we went to select our photos after the climb, because we had all paid up front for the picture package, they gave us all our individual photos along with any of the ones we took in a group. Way more than the 12 promised! It was such a great experience, that I told everyone about. My parents ended up visiting Sydney and I was telling them they HAD to do the climb. They flat out said no, they're too old (They're both in their early 60's but both pretty active) but I guess they ended up doing it and loved it! Said they were both so glad that I talked them into doing it! Fun for people of all ages!"

If you have a fear of heights it isn't that big of deal, my wife was really worried about it. But the cat walk are plenty wide, and hand rails and tethers help with the sense of security. It also is not that physically demanding. The hardest part is 4 sets of steep steps. It was really worth every dime we spent."

If you're worry about safety, you'll be well-briefed on the equipment and procedures. You have a \"slider\" that's attached from your waist to a metal thingy (gosh, I can't think of the correct word right now) of the bridge structure. that's means, you won't fall or anything. Some questionnaire to fill up and a breath analyses test done. If you're clear, then you're good to go! They provide a cap if you're climbing in the day. I went at night (it's winter) and I was provided with a fleece sweater too (which comes in a small bag that's attached to the waist band). Anyway, go for the climb! You won't regret it! The team will take care of you."

I do believe I read on one that it is 'ugly' and they comment that it should have been torn down decades ago! And others saying its boring because when you do the climb you have to go through all the 'safety crap', dunno about them but i'd rather spend and hour on safety then fall 40 stories aha. I know the amount of terrible/poor reviews are minuscule next to the 1000+ excellent ones but seriously...Now to my actual review... yes! I did the climb! And it was glorious. It was no where near as exhausting as I thought it would be, the thousands of stairs are nothing, its just like walking up a slight hill. We did the night tour, my partner had done it before and said it was better than the day one, just the way the city is lit up! Plus the photos all came out amazing. At the top the bridge it was the best feeling of accomplishment. Our climb leader, Bernie, was funny, very Aussie and had a good crack at the Americans (being the only Aussies on our climb it was amusing to watch their reactions) The full beard and thick accent noticeable to even us made him seem very outback bushrangerish. For an american would have been quite the experience in itself. Overall I think it was worth the money, don't do the express one because its the cheaper alternative, for the best experience we reckon go for the night one."

As ridiculously expensive the bridge walk was, my 10 year old daughter and I just had to do it on a perfect day. The walk was super easy, very slow paced as the guides where informing you on every possible nook and cranny of the bridge. I recommend doing this in the later afternoon as the sun shines from the west brilliantly lighting on the Opera House and the downtown buildings. As much money you spend for the walk, and cameras are not aloud you have to splurge for the photos at the end of your excursion, because it's the only proof you have of your climb. By the way, don't drink to much before you climb and use the restroom before you enter as you will have no opportunity for almost three hours to use any facilities. Bottom line, expensive but worth it!"

They do have alternative routes for those afraid of heights, but are not very sympathetic with the phobia. You are clipped in throughout your time, so completely safe. The organisation of the climb is second to none and you can tell safety is their main concern. You even practice going up and down stairs wearing your 'climbing clobber'. Every eventuality is catered for as you are given a fleece and rain jacket to carry with you on the climb. Photos and videos are taken by the guide and purchased for $30. At the end you get a group photo and certificate (which is all in with the price of the climb). Although it was more expensive than I was expecting, it is an absolute must do in Sydney and certainly one of the bucket list!"

I would expect the view from the very top would be great but with traffic roaring past on one side and mesh on the other, the views of the harbour were fairly limited. I wouldn't bother again."

We Sydney Siders affectionatly call her \"the coat hanger\" (please see images as this will explain the name :-)Plans were made in 1815 to have a bridge that crossed Sydney Harbour. It wasnt until 1923 that the winning submission was accepted and the go ahead was given. the bridge was opened in 1932 and has been in constant use ever since. The bridge has only been closed once for road re surfacing in 2013, and the original surface from 1932 was still almost perfect, great 1930's workmanship.From any angle from any vantage point around Sydney harbour, even from almost anywhere in The Rocks, and the North Shore. This magnificent single span arch bridge dominates the surrounding areas and is truely beautiful.Of course if you are energetic book yourself a \"Bridge Climbe Experiance\" This will take you through the history of the Sydney Harbour and it's first bridge crossing. Then you will be suited up, all things droppable are removed from your person, and people who wear glasses with have then thethered to your head.Even handkerchief's are tied to your person.You are then secured by a cable tether to the actual bridge its self. Once you are on your way be prepared for some slightly tough climbs and lots of walking. Once on your way the scenery and views are nothing short of stunning!Unfortunately you cant tak a camera with you, however all photographs are taken by your tour guide once on top of the bridge. Really worth the effort for the amazing views. A twighlight bridge climb is great as you get to see the stunning city & harbour views by day, then get to witness the city lights on your way back down. The bridge climb offices are located in Cumberland Street The Rocks, just up the hill from the Harbour View Hotel (pub)"

Bridge climb gives you a unique experience but really pricey, or some kibd of rip off, especially when you think that you are not allowed to take your own camera or phone. A cheaper alternative is the Pylon lookout, which will give you a great look out. Or the cheapest one (free) is the bridge walk. Take the train, go to Milsons Point station and walk back to Circular Quay station over bridge. You get the view, fresh air and you van take pictures for free!! The walk takes about 15-20 minutes."

You can't come to Sydney without visiting the Harbour Bridge.If, like me, you don't like heights, you don't need to do the Bridge Climb to get great views of the Harbour.You can walk across the bridge from one side to the other in less than 30 minutes and still have great views of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour. Or you could walk halfway to the middle o f the bridge and walk back.Note : There's quite a few stairs to get to the Harbour Bridge walkway so it's not suitable for strollers or wheelchairs."

Have you ever met anyone who wanted to go to Sydney who DIDN'T want to do the bridge climb? This is a one-of-a-kind experience that, as far as I know, isn't duplicated anywhere else in the world. And it's a surprisingly easy climb, despite the pictures and descriptions you may have seen. A tip -- take the twilight tour, it's two experiences in one; a daylight climb to the top, and a sunset/nighttime climb back down. Totally unforgettable!"

You can't take cameras, handbags or anything that could go over the edge - dangerous for you and whoever or whatever could be down below.The climb is fantastic, we had a perfect sunny morning and the view just has to be seen to be believed, one of the best experiences I have ever had and as tourist attractions go is right up there with the best of them.You are kept very safe and hooked on the whole trip moving in groups of 6 at a time and are given plenty of time to take in the view and points of interest and history to sydney.So if you are not keen on heights, take it from one who isn't and don't let that get in your way of a magical few hours.Professional photographs are available for purchase at the end of the climb."

There were only 10 of us in our group, our very senior guide was brought in on that particular Sunday morning to replace someone who\u2019d been out too late the night before ! He was brilliant ! It was a beautiful still morning with excellent visibility. Our guide reckoned \u201cThat\u2019s the clearest I\u2019ve seen the Blue Mountains for a long while\u201d. We got up on to the top for a photo shoot just the same as if we\u2019d done the Bridge Climb up the top arch. I was intrigued by the mechanism of the safety line and the connection system. You travel at your own pace, not lashed together as someone told us we would be.

The climb itself wasn't scary, a few steep steps up and down but most of it is a gradual incline/decline. We had plenty of stops to just enjoy the views. You can purchase your photos of the climb - you can get a CD of 10 photos for $49.95 so if you go in a group get this once and share electronically - well worth the memento."

Circular Quay is a reasonably easily accessible starting point and getting there is cheap and efficient with Sydney's excellent public transport network. At the quay is a tourist information booth which will provide you with ample guidance. There are multiple refreshment venues to meet all budgets and while there it might be a good opportunity to make use of the well maintained bathrooms. From there the walk through the rocks to the bridge is pleasant with views across the harbour to the opera house. The entrance to the bridge is small but easily found and there are landings where you can catch your breath. The pylon museum has a small fee and gives a good account of the history of the bridge, from the top of the pylon the views are spectacular and pretty much the same as what you would see from the more expensive and more challenging bridge climb. I was surprised at the small number of people at the pylon lookout even though it was a warm sunny Saturday afternoon in the middle of the populous 'Vivid' festival which I would have thought to be an ultra busy peak time! There were many more actually on the bridge doing the challenging climb while I comfortably observed from the tower. After the tower climb I walked across the bridge (that's free) but getting to the other side was tired so not fancying a walk back got the train across the bridge back which, using my economical multi transport ticket and the assistance of strategically placed railway transport assistance staff I was able to link up with connecting services direct to my hotel."

After many years of visiting Australia and seeing THE BRIDGE, either cruising beneath when sailing into the Harbour, riding over or the many views from various tours, at last I managed to experience THE CLIMB. What a fascinating and enjoyable experience!The scenic gallery of photographs in the shop certainly whet the appetite! Then, after booking the tour, the pre-climb routine is extremely well organized. The formalities include signing an indemnity which confirms you are aware of the risks and void any direct responsibility for any accidents.Then what is VERY REASSURING is the very thorough PRE-CLIMB TRAINING to ensure that you are completely aware of what is involved, and again confirm you are comfortable to continue. We then discarded our outer clothing and dressed in a boiler suit and fitted with our safety harness. Then you are required, after a demonstration, to complete a mini SAMPLE OF THE CLIMBING THAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE. Again, you have ther opportunity to cancel if you are not satisfied that you feel comfortable to continue. You are equipped with your safety harness, Gloves, warm and rain proof jacket, beanie ( in case it is cold). By this time you really know that you are in good hands with your guide. The climb and the views are FANTASTIC. Particularly, as I experienced the twilight tour and the decent in the dark. The lights of Sydney and vies of the Opera House etc, are truly Magical. At various stages our guide pointed out the many highlights and took photographs of the group of climbers. One feature was the Hotel that was a focal point for the many who were involved in the actual building of the Bridge. A fabulous place to visit after the climb. After changing back into your own clothing, you the can select and purchase copies of the photographs taken on the climb. A truly memorable experience NOT TO BE MISSED."

Start at Luna Park and then follow the footpath round Lavender Bay. When you come to the end go up the steps and walk back down Lavender Bay Road - great views all round.

As I was born in England near Newcastle- on- Tyne I was only to keen to tell anyone who asked that it was a large copy of the prototype ( Newcastle bridge) I didn't have a complaint about the day, the traffic was noisy, but then it always is, I would have liked to get closer to the edge but safety demands come first."

It's an easy walk, & just a gentle incline until you reach half way, walking towards the city. It is a very popular thing to do for joggers, parents with prams, older couples, in fact anyone. There is a bike path on the other side, & that seems very popular. Access the bridge from Milsons point rail station. The great thing is that it doesn't cost anything. It is possible to leave the Bridge at steps leading down into the Rocks area, where there are numerous places to eat. It is also possible to continue around to the Circular Quay exit, & of course the views are fantastic."

It is the world's largest (but not the longest) steel arch bridge.It is fondly known by the locals as the 'Coathanger 'because of its arch-based design.We took train to Milson Point and walked on the bridge to Circular Quay. It has most breathtaking views along the way.The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel through arch bridge across Sydney Harbour that carries rail, vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic between the Sydney central business district (CBD) and the North Shore. The dramatic view of the bridge, the harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is an iconic image of Sydney, and Australia."

There are 200 stairs to the Pylon Lookout which takes you 87 metres above sea level. There are 3 levels of exhibits on this climb where you can see information on the history and construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, you can also buy souvenirs of your visit. From the Pylon Lookout you can walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The walk to the North side of Sydney will take approximately 15-20 minutes. The climb is open 7 days a week from 10.00 am to 5.00 pm and cost $13.00 per adult, don\u2019t forget to show your Bridge Climb ticket as it gets you into this climb for free. At the top you have great views of Sydney and the harbour. While in Sydney this is worth taking time to do. Note: I could not find a way onto the bridge for wheelchair users. After warming up on this climb you can then tackle the Sydney Harbour Bridge. They say to allow 3 \u00bd hours to do the climb but a bit of this time is taken up on the safety talk before you climb. There are 1,332 steps. No I didn\u2019t count them on my way up. Take your time and allow for your own fitness, don\u2019t worry if you slow the group down a bit. Try not to climb during the hotter parts of the day, as it gets very warm. Try early morning or late afternoon. If you want the best experience book in for the sunset climb. The standard price of the climb ranges from $198 to $348 depending on the time of day you book. This will increase for peak periods. When on top you will get a chance to pose for your souvenir photo. A hint it is hard to look your best while dressed in their jump suits."

The bridge climb is expensive, over $250, different prices for different times of the day, but it is really fun. You have about 10 people in your group from memory and a headphone to listen to the guide. You have to be an adult but it is manageable by young and old alike. You have to prove you can go up ladders and steps wearing a special flight suit and you are totally safe with a safety clip attaching you to a safety wire. The views are amazing. You can't take your camera or phone or anything that might be dropped as that could cause a hazard, so be prepared to buy the photos. We went up late in the afternoon so we could see the sun go down, the lights start to twinkle on and it was wonderful. The staff are fantastically helpful. A cruise boat went under the bridge as we got to the top and they were waving at us and we were waving back at them. It really was fun. If you are scared of heights it would probably not be for you as you can see straight down in most parts, and it really is quite high. I was looking for something that my husband might like to do on our wedding anniversary and this was a real winner."

We purchased our tickets from bridgeclimb.com, quick and easy.For those that are deathly afraid of heights (like my wife), this is a piece of cake. My wife was strongly against the climb until our granddaughter (after having done it) shamed her into doing it. My friend is also afraid of heights. After the climb my wife and my friend were both extremely thankful that they had been talked into it. Your are tethered the entire way and, for the most part, the path is as wide as a sidewalk.

Groups of 14 people go up to the top and then come back down the way you came (not down the other side of the bridge). They give you a jumpsuit to wear and there are unisex changing rooms. You put everything in a provided locker, as you are not allowed to take ANYTHING up with you (unless it's medically necessary). So no cameras, no phones, no nothing! Then they get you outfitted with radios, rain jackets, safety ropes and they put you through training and a mock climb. It's very well run, so there are no surprises when you get out there. Although the ladders can be steep, there aren't that many of them; the steps are pretty gradual (not steep) and there are metal railings on both sides of you at all times. FYI, there are a few small spaces you have to climb over/through where you have to watch your head.PROS: Amazing views, good guides giving you interesting facts, very safety concious. I have a slight fear of heights, but I never had any fear up there, as you are constantly locked in. The Pylon Access is good for two months, so if you encounter rain like we did, you could go back and get photos on a good weather day. The people at the photo desk were helpful in getting all of my groups' pictures together on one disc and even suggested a very good restaurant.CONS: Even though we made reservations for the same time (11am), our family was separated into two groups of climbers (the 11:05 climb and the 11:35 climb). The person at the desk was kind of rude and unhelpful regarding the situation. It was raining on and off when we were on our climb, and unless it's a lightning storm, it's a rain or shine climb. So the rain jackets they gave us were definitely put to use, our pictures were sadly overcast/dark and the metal ladders were steep and slippery. The climb itself doesn't take that long, but there's a lot of stopping and standing around to look at the view while they go through the group to take individual pictures. The whole thing is expensive: $248 AUD for one off peak adult (includes certificate of achievement, one group photo of the 14, free entry to the Pylon lookout) , $89 for all the photos taken up there (which you're kind of stuck buying since you will want to get photos of you and your family/friends without the strangers and you are not allowed to bring your own camera). The merchandise in the gift shop is also expensive. T-shirts start at $30 AUD. Even if you purchase the big image package as I did, it will come on a CD. They charge an extra $10 AUD for a flash drive.It's a once in a lifetime experience, so I would recommend it, but make sure to double check your group's reservation times and bring lots of $$."

The Opera House is the Icon of Sydney, and I wish to take nothing away from it, but for me my heart belongs to the Harbour Bridge. It\u2019s not as festive, but is it far more dominant \u2013 you can seemingly see it from every corner of the city. From a distance it has a kind of gallant restraint, majestic but not assertive, but up close it is all might. It soars above you, so high that you can pass a the ten-story building beneath it, and looks like the heaviest thing on earth. You'll see it in more paintings in the Sydney museums than anything else. Everything that is in it \u2013 the stone blocks in its four towers, the latticework of girders, the metal plates, the 6 million rivets \u2013 is the biggest of its type you have ever seen. This is a bridge built by people who have had an Industrial Revolution, during the early 1900's making the scale that much more monsterous The arch alone weighs thirty thousand tons. This is a great bridge."

It takes a good 45mins to 1 hour just to get all the gear on but that's part of the experience. It's expensive but worth it. The only thing I would change is that they give you a free pointless picture of your whole tour group that no one wants ie. a bunch of strangers and then make you pay for photos of your own party. It would be better if they gave you a free photo of your party, it wouldn't cost them anything extra to do. Otherwise a good experience."

            "review": "Don't Waste Money on the Bridge Climb - Walk Across For Free. The Sydney Harbour Bridge is spectacular and can be thoroughly enjoyed for FREE thanks to the protected walking path that goes from one shore to the other. For about $15 you can pay to climb the tower on The Rocks side where you'll get a great view of the Opera House and the harbour for picture taking, plus you can take in the history of the bridge in their mini-museum (the Bridge Climb office in The Rocks has a more comprehensive museum which is free to explore).The Bridge Climb costs about $350 which is about 3 times as expensive as it's worth. It's not that I didn't find it cool, but for $350 we should have been rappelling down the center or something much more adventurous. It's a very tame experience - hardly more exciting than walking across the path on your own, and the worst part is they don't allow you to take your own camera or pictures. In hindsight I completely understand why handheld objects that could fall on the highway are prohibited, but the whole reason we did the climb was so we could take spectacular pictures, so at the very least the company needs to clarify before collecting your money that cameras aren't allowed. The guide will take pictures for you and of you, but each print is $25 (who wants physical prints anymore?). They should have an electronic-only option that you can post to Facebook for $5-$10 (free marketing for them too).If you're from Australia where everything is more expensive than most cities in the US, the $350 fee may feel reasonable (it's all relative). We embarked on several extreme adventures in New Zealand that were less expensive / more exciting / and included a meal, so to us it felt overpriced. That said, if you're determined to do it, know that it can be uncomfortable for anyone with vertigo, even a tiny fear of heights, or even a tiny bit of claustrophobia (the ladder cages you'll climb are very tall and narrow)."

First off, as a bridge to walk across (the standard walk along the road), it is actually quite boring, apart from the spectacular views down below of course. However, as a bridge to look at, as part of the famous Sydney Harbour, it could be the most famous bridge in the world, it really is amazing to photograph, and perhaps enjoy a pint in its shadow (or go to Luna Park underneath).You could of course also do the amazing Sydney Harbour Bridge Walk, which costs around $200 for the cheapest option in the daytime, and conquer your fear of heights! However, as the price is quite expensive, not everybody will be doing this. Rather, they will probably just walk across alongside the road, which as I said is rather boring.The get your fix of the Bridge, sail underneath it on a ferry on your way to Darling Harbour, or take some photos of it from Circular Quay."

The climb on top of the bridge itself is not very steep, and is done at a slow speed with lots of stops for pictures. The path to the top is quite wide so one does not feel like you are close to an edge. Each climber has a safety line on that can only be disconnected at the end of the climb.

You cannot bring your own camera or phone but they take your pics and they are a must for keep sake. For $90.00 you can get a disc with all pics taken. The walk is pricy but worth every penny. You won't regret it. I will do it again one day."

What a thrill and beautiful sites atop the Sydney Harbour Bridge.Is it Hard to do??? NO - I'm 55 and not in the best of shape and I was never struggling or out of breath. The Climb take about 3.5 hours from check in to suiting up to training, to the climb with stops for stories about the bridge and a few photo along the way. The steps are built into the curve of the bridge and are nice and low so it is less work than walking up stadium steps. These are the same steps the maintenance crews use to work on the bridge.Is it Scary? NO - you are 100% safe. You ware a harness that is attached to a cable the whole time during the climb. The cable/harness system is setup so you can NOT unhook even if you wanted to do so. Also the route is enclosed with hand rails on both sides of you and each side has a lower, middle and top rail so there is no way to even slip out of the path.We did the evening climb in the Dark and Rain and it still was safe and fun and what a view from the top of the bridge. You can't bring a camera so you'll have to rely on the photos the staff take and buy them at the end of the tour.My wife and I rated it 2nd only to Scuba Diving the Great Barrier Reef (which we love to dive)"

Kitting up and briefing by staff fine, first part of climb - thought to myself, can't do this too frightening even with safety harness and line on but as there were women in front of me, some over 70 years old and not showing signs of bother i thought, I had better do this. After the initial shock and worry the horizontal walks and the vertical climbs between the road way AND the railway were a bit frightening but once you get on the main spans it's fantastic. The views arephenomenal and the stress of the climb almost disappears for me it did anyway. To anybody in or going to Australia and in particular Sydney, do it, climb the bridge. It's scary if you don't like heights like me but perfectly safe and one of those things you have got to do before you die.Brilliant."

Yes you can walk across the bridge at street level and have great views of the harbor but they are not as great as the view you have at the height of the arch. There are two route to climb. The outer (the highest arch) and the inner. I climbed the outer and believe it has to be the best. The views are great but you are unable to take a camera on your climb. Understandable as any thing that falls to street level could be detrimental to those below. There are at least 5 photo spots on the bridge were your tour guide will take pictures of you or the entire group. One picture is included in your climb then the first purchased picture is $25 Australian dollars. The remainder are less. The climb was enjoyable because of the information imparted by the tour guide about the building of the bridge. Do not expect a quick climb. It takes about 45-60 for safety and outfitting and then another 2-2.5 hours to climb. You start with a questionnaire then a test for alcohol. You are given a climbing suit and fitted with a climbing beat, fleece, head set, etc. You then have to practice on a simulated bridge climb. This is all before you climb the true bridge. There are groups going on the climb every 10-15 mins. This in itself prevents you from having a fast climb. My climb took over 3 hours total (safety included). There was a delay because the cast from Modern Family took pictures on the bridge ahead of us and then the group climbing in front of us had a proposal at the top of the bridge. Be prepared for a delay. It is not a difficult climb. It has great views. It is pricey. You also get free entrance to the tower at the end of the Bridge. You will have good views with the ability to take pictures."

There are a few ladders to climb first which is not hard but the climb itself is easy. The staff were wonderful, funny and had loads of interesting info to tell you. The views over Sydney Harbour are just breathtaking! I don't think there is a harbour in the world as beautiful as ours! Well worth the $309 I would definitely do it again!"

We were glad we listened to that. The bridge was just a bridge - there is nothing grand about it once you are walking across it. It did allow for some nice photos of the opera house and harbor from some different angles, but if you are short on time and have to choose whether to walk across the bridge or do something different - I would chose the \"something different.\" It was quite windy when we were there and I was told that is common so keep that in mind if you do decide to cross.

The whole process from getting ready to doing the walk is finely tuned and you feel safe and reassured from the start of the walk. You get to know the other participants on the walk who were all friendly. The views are outstanding, at the top you get the chance to shout as loud as you can, take in the fresh air, contemplate the walk up and the beautiful views ..... a very reflective time at the top. Oh yes, the asthma? The walk guide carried my ventolin inhaler for me in his pouch, but the stops along the walk meant I could catch my breath normally as the pace was good ... so no ventolin required!! Bonus! ;o)"

We started at Circular Quay and took the elevator up to the 3rd floor above the train track. Once there, you walk toward the bridge until you hit the bridge path. Keep walking, and it will take you across the bridge. We passed another entrance at The Rocks. The pedestrian path is only on one side (Opera House side), so you can't see off the other side. But that is ok because the views are stunning, and you can spend as much time as you like looking at all of the scenery and activity in the harbor.We went all the way across and then walked back. You can get off the bridge and take one of the ferries back to Circular Quay if you like. The Hop-On Hop-Off stopped as we got there, and some people took it. We wanted to just enjoy the experience of walking it again.The walk costs nothing and takes only time. Reminded me of walking across the Golden Gate Bridge but was warmer. Would do it again in a heartbeat."

Although the view from top of the bridge is nothing more than spectacular, forget about taking your camera, phone or any other thing with you, not even a goPro attached to your helmet or chest is allowed as they are taken from you as you enter and saved in a locker, so your memories will have an \"additional charge\", I understand the safety requirements but I believe that are better solutions rather than restraining you to use your own photographic equipment.At the end of the day was a nice experience but a taste of disappointment is still present."

After getting suited up and removing all items on your wrist and in your pockets (lockers provided) you are instructed in the skills of climbing up and down what are essentially a series of ladders used to get to the actual arch of the bridge. Once there, it's a relatively easy walking climb to the top stopping as many times along the way as you'd like to take in the spectacular view. We did this climb in the late afternoon so that we could be at the top to watch the lights come on in Sydney. I'd highly recommend this time as it was truly beautiful to watch evening fall from atop the world. Your guide takes lots of photos so although cameras aren't allowed on the climb, you will have a record of doing this. Don't miss this!!!"

We had already been up the Sydney Tower Eye during the day. The night climb was perfect for my sister - who was a little hesitant at times with the ladders. The guides were very supportive and encouraging of everyone on the climb and there is no race to finish first/pressure to hurry along. The night climb works out to be a little cheaper too - coming in at $198AUDpp. We also pre-booked a 2 pack of photos for $30 (they also provide a link for you to upload these directly to Facebook!). You get given a souvenir hat, 30-second video (that you can upload to social media), a group photo and certificate. Remember to wear fully enclosed footwear. My sister had on Sketchers, which covered her toes and heel, yet because they only had a Velcro strap across the top of the foot, she was given Volleys to switch into. They provide beanies, cloths (for sweat/tears etc.) and straps if you have glasses to secure them. You cannot take cameras and/or any loose items. You wear a headset to listen to commentary provided by the guide. This was perhaps our only negative. Our guide was very difficult to hear in the training and with headsets on. Nonetheless, she was lovely. Oh and when they ask you to strip down to your jocks/knickers - they are serious! (Don't worry this happens in a change room) The overalls are thick and they also provide wet weather trousers - so I'd imagine you'd certainly overheat. I thought the joke was on me!It was a wonderful night on the bridge that ended with a great sense of achievement."

We could have walked a bit further across and found our way to ground level and taken a ferry back to Circular Quay, but in the time frame that we had, we turned around at the furthest tower and walked back across. From the bridge I finally got to see the Opera House from the angle which I have most often see in movies - when you're standing beside (or near) the Opera House it is difficult to put all the pieces into the proper place to make sense of it all.

Sydney Harbor Bridge is as iconic for this city as its famous Opera House, and we had made up our minds before we arrived to swallow the outrageous $200 pp cost and climb its arch to the peak. Well, the Bridge Climb is not what we expected, and we are glad that we decided NOT to do it.First, it took us quite a while even to find the place where you pay your money and join a group -- we had to ask directions from a police officer we happened to see in the restaurant where we stopped for breakfast.Second, we learned that we were required to stay with a group and we were NOT permitted to bring our camera with us! While we can understand why this regulation exists, we were not about to spend that kind of money and be denied the opportunity to take any photos. That rule was a deal-breaker for us.However, we learned that we could climb one of the south pylons for only $16 per person, and while doing so we could stay up on the observation deck as long as we wanted, AND -- most important -- we could take all the photos we pleased! This opportunity struck us as a genuine bargain, and we jumped at it. This is not a long, dull climb, either. After every few courses of stairs, there was a landing with exhibits, a souvenir shop and friendly people willing to answer questions. And the last thing you see when leaving the pylon is a short film about how the bridge was built. This was a fun and interesting thing to do, and we recommend it!We took dozens of photos (the viewing platform offers a 360-degree walk-around, with views in every direction) and enjoyed the experience. This is a far more reasonable way to enjoy the SHB and the fine views it affords."

Of course, there is the opera building and all the boats and ships to watch. Right now Sydney is beginning to lose it's place as the number one port in Australia to Melbourne. Both cities are about 4.5 million people.Anyway, if you like bungee jumping this is the bridge for it. The activity that I have never seen until the Sydney Harbour Bridge is a group of people trekking on top of the bridge. Not on the roadway or the walkway at that level but up above -- part of the structure that keep the bridge from falling -- on the curved part. There are people who do this very thing. The cost is over AU$250 to go with a group of people who are suitably linked together across the top of the bridge. It's windy. The high cost for a walk is the cost of insurance. This walk is for the strong of heart. It was the most amazing use of a bridge that I have yet to see. At the very top of the bridge the view is breathtaking. (So I was told since I do not have a passion for walks that are on architecture that is very high and windy.)"

Once we got there, I enjoyed looking at the bridge and learning about its history, but walking across the bridge was good enough for me.Actually we were one of the few people who were walking across the bridge. Sounds like a lot of hype and marketing to me. Walking across the bridge was free and you could take all the photos that you wanted. We had great views of the city and the Opera House. The last I checked it cost over $200 to climb the bridge and it monopolizes half of your day."

While its technical functioning, with 6 lanes of traffic, two pedestrian walkways, and a rail line, has doubtless been critical to the city's economy, the sight itself is jarring, the polar opposite of the opera house. Its oppressive mass was perfect, no doubt, for futurism and art-deco, with their deification of the industrial age, but that time is gone. Bridges now seek to appear light and elegant. I hope this great city will find the means and will to do something about this (as they have in another part of the city, one, unfortunately, much less visible)."

My one criticism is that, whereas spectacles are secured to your person, this option for cameras is not available and you are limited to (a) the photos taken by the climb leader and (b) expensive photos then 'having' to be purchased. They could have made some money by hiring the cameras securing gadgets and allowing photos to be taken by individuals.

Off I went to make my payment...until the full cost was revealed (close to$200-depending on what time of day you select). My budget couldn't stretch that far, so I opted to walk the bridge and visit the museum located in one of the stone pillars.

We all walked the bridge, got great views of the city and the Opera House, plus got to see a ton of people. We took the stairs up to a little museum inside one of the stone blocks. It was well worth the few bucks. The Bridge is a must do while in Sydney."

Coolest attraction in Sydney - you get a climbing suite and learn and practice climbing in the safety of the attraction facility.Unfortunately you can't take your camera with you, so your guider will take your photos - you can get it on a CD or a printed copy at the time of payment when you climb your way down tierd and happy!The experience is expensive, so pay attention to the price, because it changes according to the time of day."

To save some dollars, we chose the day climb slot just before the twilight session, thus saving AUD50-60 per person. You get to see the sunset on the way down just as the twilight session comes up. In fact, we were just across the bridge from the early twilight session group and shared the same amazing sunset view from the top of the bridge.The entire climb is very safe, with good safety briefing and equipment. The grey overalls are not the most fashionable but it absolutely makes sense to blend in with the bridge, even if it doesn't photograph nicely."

Like most, I'd seen photos of friend's on the bridge with the wide stairway behind them... It wasn't until actually doing the climb that I realized there are some tighter, less open spaces en route (may be a bit nerve-wracking for the claustrophobic but simple enough, just duck here and angle here...). The whole experience is a lot of fun. You arrive (probably with some down time to explore the gift shop), get decked out in a jumpsuit and go over safety procedures, then as you climb the guide shares anecdotes and historical facts via the provided headphones. You can feel the powerful gusts of wind as you climb higher and higher (don't worry, you have a harness so you're very secure) all the while enjoying the most amazing views of the glittering harbour and bustling city below. I strongly recommend you pay the extra for the souvenir photo (you can't take your own camera - or anything else - as there's a risk of dropping items on the traffic below). I feel so happy each time I look back at the images as it is such a wonderful memory. It may be a bit pricey but it's well worth it for the experience. The staff are very professional yet fun and they use quality equipment so you feel safe every step of the way. DO IT!!! You won't be disappointed."

The bridge spans the 1600 feet gap from the north to the south shore, which was previously only accessible by ferry, and accommodates pedestrian walkways, two railway lines and an eight-lane road. Visitors can experience the bridge in an adventurous way by climbing to the top as part of organized group for breathtaking views. I did not try climbing. For the less daring 200 steps lead to Pylon Lookout for equally fantastic views at 285 feet above the water, with three levels of exhibits on the way up depicting the history and construction of the bridge.Sydney Harbour Bridge is a feat of engineering genius. It took 1400 workers (16 of whom died in the process) eight year to complete. Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Opera House, The Rocks, Circular Quay ---are all in same place. These are can be enjoyed in a full day."

Can't praise the staff enough but cost was a little expensive and whilst they don't allow you to take cameras up, the guides will take pictures of you (for which they do charge a small fortune).Although 140metres above the harbour, not at all scary - in fact the only unsettling part was up and down the two series of vertical ladders.Despite the above, a must-do experience which we all thoroughly enjoyed."

U are always attached to the railings. The guides are doing great job, you hear stories not only about the bridge but Sydney history and major highlights as well.I must admit I expected that the climb will be even more strenuous, however it is done at moderate pace, giving commentaries on the way, making you take a breath, while they are taking photos of you as well.

The views from the top of the bridge are breathtaking and even though this is a very expensive experience, when will you be in Sydney again???Btw, we are both in our 60s and easily made this climb.Lastly, special thanks to our guide, Em!

We booked for this time as people had recommended it so that you get to see the sunset and it was certainly worth it! It takes about 1,5hours in all to actually climb the bridge and the rest is for preparing, safety talks etc. I'm not a lover of heights but this was truely awesome. You are nowhere the edges and the leaders are really great giving you information about the different things you can see from the bridge as well as its construction. I'd definitely recommend! I'm glad we did the twilight as we got to see Sydney in the daylight (also while it wasnt really hot) and then also at sunset/night."

A wonderful guide talked us through safety issues, the do's and dont's etc. then got us suited and geared up for the walk. At first I was very apprehensive, but as we ascended higher up the walkway, I gain confidence and never looked back. Well, I did look back, and down and up and across. The view was magnificent.....the Opera House, the city surrounds, the twilight that grew into darkness, the fireworks on the harbour and in various spots in and around Sydney.

You get to see the shockingly beautiful view of the Sydney Skyline, framed by Azure blue skies above and Aquamarine Waters of the Bay. From this bridge, travelers can get one of the best photos of the Sydney Opera House as well provided you can get the lens to get through the lattice fence. Tip: Take the train on the NORTHSHORE line to Milson Point Station. That station is directly on the North end of the bridge allowing you to climb up stairs and out onto the bridge itself to walk along the pedestrian side back towards the city centre.If you can afford it, by all means take the Bridge Climb. But during Summer, it costs a stratospheric AUD $300 per person. Off-Peak season and it is still around AUD $200 per person. Not sure what tradition is it, but there are padlocks of different shapes, colours and sizes on the lattice fence, each with its own \"XX Loves XX\" message. Maybe it is a symbol of enduring love as enduring as the bridge itself? The walk along the entire length of the bridge from Milson's Point Station to the City centre does not take long at all, roughly 15 minutes at a slow leisurely walk. There is a lookout tower on top of one of the bridge towards the city centre but you do have to pay admission to get up there. However there are exhibits (upon payment of admission) that shows the history of the bridge and how the bridge is built. (A little history trivia: Melbourne, the rival city has always resented the Bridge because a significant portion of the financing of the Bridge came from Melbourne's city coffers during the gold rush that made Melbourne a prosperous and wealthy city. The Bridge was delayed and over budget during its construction. Sound familiar doesn't it?)Go during special days and events and the Bridge lights up with fireworks and amazing light shows."

I have travelled both north and south over it and appears to be well made and solid built of some sort of metal or possibly wood. I would highly reccomend using this to cross the water. One negative I have found is that I often see people climbing to the top which I assume is people trying to commit suicide, so if crossing i would suggest bringing an umbrealla."

We were on a 'once in a lifetime' trip to Australia so this seemed like something we ought to do. I'm glad we did, it is so iconic and the views over Sydney are lovely. That said, it is very expensive for what you get - it's basically a one hour climb made into a three hour experience somehow. We were also particularly cross about the photos. You can't take your own camera - for safety reasons but I'm sure they're happy about that situation and the fact you have to buy their pictures. Never mind we thought - there's a picture included in the price. What was annoying is that the one picture is not one of your choice, i.e. you and your nearest and dearest. It's a group one of you and the other 15 strangers on the climb with you. Not something you are likely to ever display in your house and meaning you have to fork out an additional $25 for a picture you do want. Felt this was a bit of a racket given the price of the ticket. That said, it remains one of those 'must do' experiences if you are visiting Sydney, you will enjoy it."

An eight hour flight from Malaysia to Sydney passing nothing much on the way, perhaps some kangaroos hopping below. We stay at a hotel at the east side of the town, walking towards the harbour front, we passed by a navy docking and then through the Botanic garden. The view on the way already mesmerised us, such beautiful park in the city, perhaps that should be how all cities look like, garden as your neighbourhood. Navigating out of the garden we come to back of the Opera house (or should it be the side) keep walking along the edge of the water, you come to see the Circular quay and the harbour bridge at close up. To get on the Harbour Bridge walk way you first come to the Rocks, from here is a bit tricky, you will walk up the street called Argyle street beside the Museum of Contemporary Art about 50m or so, on your right you see the Argyle Stair, go up the stair walk across the road then you can find the stair way to the Harbour bridge. Don't walk towards where you think you can get up to the bridge, there were no access. A walk across the Harbour Bridge on a winter day is most rewarding, the afternoon sun cast shades of shadow on all buildings, the Harbour Front and its water was glistening in the golden sun. We walked the entire length of the bridge, got off at the end went below the bridge until we came to a ferry terminal where we took a ferry back to the Circular quay, we even took pictures of the underside of the bridge as the ferry went underneath it, it was really an experience which we will never forget."

A lot of it I thought was unnecessary, particularly the handkerchief around our wrists etc. Once we were finally on the bridge it was great, I went on a clear day and the views were amazing. The guide told us lots of interesting facts and kept us entertained. You aren't allowed to take anything up with you, including cameras, so you have to pay for any photos that are taken of you. I didn't really appreciate this given how much we already had to spend just to get on the climb, and the photos were about \u00a325 each!

I was worried having recently had a back operation but all the staff made me feel reassured and offered a pair of braces to take the weight of the safety belt. In fact this attention to detail is essential from a safety viewpoint but the climb is no more than a leisurely walk. You have to remove all loose items such as hair grips, watches and bracelets. Of course you are not allowed to take any cameras or phones so they can get you in the photo booth afterwards at $25 for your first photo and $10 for each one after that. Who is not going to buy?It's not cheap but really worth it. Tick it off the bucket list and spend 3 hours on the must do experience in Sydney Do it!"

The Bridge is a must and you have 2 choices to cross it, you can pay a small fortune and climb to the top and on a bad day see nothing or there is a walkway across that the locals use to cross from North to South and the views are great and it is free and of course no time restraint so plenty of time for pictures.The walk takes around half an hour and nice eateries and bars at either end and choice of walking back or taking a train."

I have never seen a freworks show like this. What an awesome show. It took my breath away. My friend and I camped out like the Australians to get a good view of the firework show. Here are some tips for people who are not from Sydney.1. Get there early. We claimed our spot at 10 am.2. Pack sunscreen, lots of beverages, food. If you have a cooler fill with ice because it got very hot. Make sure you have blankets are something to sit on. ( Australians had small tents)3. Pack an small umbrella. It started raining shortly.4. Arrange for transportation for after the show is over. All the ferries and taxis were not operating and we had to walk back to our hotel. I had a bad knee and that was a bummer.5. Make sure you have a jacket because it got cool by the time the show began.6. Use the bathroom because the queue for the toilet was 2 hours long. 7, The show lasted only 11 minutes but it was worth my trip to Sydney... Have fun and Happy New Year"

The path runs on top of the Circular Quay rail line so it provides excellent and changing views of the whole downtown waterfront area including the Quay, Opera House, Harbour Bridge and the Rocks before joining with the Harbour Bridge footpath on the eastern side of the bridgeThe path extends from lower Macquarie Street on the city side to Broughton Street in Kirribilli on the other side of the bridge. Kirribilli has lots of cafes if you need a refreshment, and if you don't fancy the walk back, just walk through the underpass to the Milsons Point station and catch the train back.Access on the city side is via the path on the or up the steps on the left immediately downhill from the motorway underpass (look for the sign saying Cahill's Walk) on Macquarie Street. Alternatively you can take the loop path across the road or the glass elevator on the eastern side of Circular Quay. There are a couple of flights of steps above the Rocks area, but otherwise the gradient is easy.Highly Recommended"

The first thing you see flying into Sydney, Where Sydney siders expect New Years Eve fireworks to be coming out of every span and arch. From here the rest of the world gets the first showing on TV of the New Year being brought in. The spot where Paul Hogan worked painting the bridge, Where history saw Colonel Francis Edward De Groot cut the ribbon with his sword, on horseback, on 19th March 1932, before the State Premier could get to the ribbon with his scissors. The place where one can see all, from the Harbour Headlands in the East to Parramatta in the West. (the Parramatta bit is an exageration). These days one can even walk over the arch, something I would never do being terrified of heights, but thousands do. Go for it, walk over the arch, have a Crocodile,Kangaroo and Emu pizza with a beer afterwards at one of the pubs underneath and have a ball."

Walk across the Bridge to Milsons Point where the Luna Park is. Yes, you can walk across the Bridge, not over the bridge. It is a nice walk if the weather is fine. You can have a good view of the harbour up there. Then you can come down from Milsons Point and walk to the Luna Park. You are right under the Bridge and you can have a good view of the bridge from there. Also Luna Park is an iconic park in Sydney. Just take a photo of the entrance of the Park will already make you feel the festive atmosphere. Hope you enjoy the walk as much as I do."

Just spending some time strolling around the building is a strange joy in itself. Then make your way to a nearby park and take in the sight of the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge.Around noon, book yourself into one of the several Darling Harbour boat cruise. The boat makes a leisurely circuit of the harbour while you have your lunch and takes in the sight.There is a bridge tour too, but IMHO its way too expensive.  And of course, checking the weather report for the day is always a wise thing to do."

Returning to Sydney for the first time 30 years after leaving for the US, my breath was taken away when I first caught a partial glimpse of the Sydney Harbour Bridge from Circular Quay Station during the train ride from the airport to our hotel. The Opera House gets all the hype, but the sight of the Australian flags flying high on the bridge viewed from the foreshore on a sunny day is just as iconically Sydney!"

Opened in 1932,the bridge spans the harbour joining the north and south shores.It has 2 railtracks and 8 road lanes and carries thousands of vehicles each way each day.It is easily accessable and you can walk over it and enjoy exalted views of Sydney and the harbour.A camera is a \"must\".Walking access is free but if you have vertigo,be prepared,its a long way \"up\".Theres is also a commercial bridge climb for those who want to go right up and over the span.BUT ITS EXPENSIVE costing from $200 to $300 a trip per time of day and you have to enjoy walking/climbing to do it..On the northern side [milsons point] there are little cafes to recover at and look around an old part of Sydney. There are walkways on each side of the bridge,so go north on one side and then go south on the other side and get to enjoy the prettiest harbour in the world.{Im biased}."

It doesn't matter where you see it from- the Opera House, the Royal Botanic Gardens- or how many times you see it. It will always stun you into silence. I could not do the bridge climb (severe shortage of time plus a fear of heights) but when I left Sydney I was determined to come back and do it. That's just how magnificent it is! Make sure you walk the length of the harbour bridge. The Pylon Lookout (entry fee required for this), located midway, is a must-visit point. A climb up 200 odd stairs later you end up with a spectacular view of the harbour and the many ferries and boats and yachts and what-not's gliding serenely in the waters while the Opera house benignly looks on. After the climb up and down the stairs, there is a small area inside where they play a video featuring a photo montage of the history of the bridge. That is why the entire experience is so humbling- to learn about the men who put their all into making this bridge what it is today. Not to be missed when you are in Sydney!"

There are a number of options as regards how best to 'tackle' the bridge and you should not necessarily confine yourself to one of them. Obvisouly you can cross it (either on foot, by car, by train and so on), go underneath it (by boat), climb up it (to the top of the arch) or walk up to the top of the pylon where there is a good lookout point. I did not do the bridge climb (i.e. across the arch) but did do everything else and would thoroughly recommend it. The climb to the top of the pylon is particularly worth doing (a) because there is a good vantage point to take some excellent photographs (which I believe is prohibited if you do the 'bridge climb') and (b) there is an informative little museum on your way up."

What can you say about the Sydney Harbour Bridge? there are superlatives like, awesome, amazing, great, fantastic...all true...but the interesting thing is the harbour bridge has many moods, which makes this icon of Sydney something special. From every new years eve fireworks display, to groups and usually not just one but several walking groups climbing the bridge at any one time, wherever you are around Circular Quay and the harbour, the views are truly memorable, and the mood changes at night with sparkling lights, with the water craft continually cruising the waterways of the harbour, this is a spectacular must see of Australia.Took a walk from Circular Quay around past the Park Hyatt Hotel, taking in the sights of the harbour and ending up right under the bridge, that seems to be a popular fishing spot curiously!! To stand underneath with a view of the Opera House, you get to understand the strong magnificent effort put in to building this icon over ten years.The bridge links Sydney metropolitan area to the North Shore, home of some famous Aussies, and Luna Park and the Prime Ministers residence.The bridge climb is a must do, and depending on weather conditions on my next trip to Sydney, hopefully, can actually take part in a bridge climb for even more superlatives!!"

It was a great experience that I have relished and described many times since. The climb is intimidating prior, but the logistics and staff are outstanding and very reassuring, making it easy for a non-risk taker but eager traveller. Expensive, but very glad I did it. This year, in 2013, my wife and I stayed near the bridge and got equivalent or better views from our hotel, then walked across the bridge at evening rush hour/sunset. Walking kept us in the city, rather than elevating us above it. The views still great but now we were able to absorb a greater sense of how the bridge fits in the life of the city. Wide walks on the eastern side accommodate thousands of walkers - commuters, exercisers, tourists and locals - very bustling alongside busy traffic and double decker trains. I think I enjoyed this even more than the climb. One is experiencing Sydney and the other is a minor feat. Walk takes an hour and is free, climb takes several hours - essentially a half day. One or the other should be a must if you're a first time traveller to Sydney."

SYDNEY HARBOUR BRIDGESydney Harbour Bridge commonly known as the \u201cCoat Hanger\u201d serves as a crossing from the North Shore to the Central Business District which takes about 10 minutes when the traffic is flowing. However, during peak hours in the morning and evening, expect traffic jams with bumper to bumper car traffic and it takes at least an hour to cross the bridge, so factor in this time when planning to cross the bridge for appointments, meetings or dinners. There is a toll charge both ways for motorists and motor cyclists and free for pedestrians and cyclists on special lanes designated for them to the right and left hand side of the bridge. A railway line runs along the bridge from the North Shore stations into the city stations. As one crosses the bridge, the tops of the sail roofs of the Sydney Opera House can be seen. Sydney Harbour Bridge, a very well known landmark is the largest in the world standing at 134 metres above the harbour. It was reported that in 1942 American and Dutch pilots flew their airplanes under the bridge and in 1943, RAAF pilots flew under the bridge when one pilot changed course at the last minute to fly the plane over the top of the bridge, clearing it in the nick of time. This is not allowed today though flights coming in to land at Sydney Airport fly above the bridge so passengers can catch a glimpse of the majestic Sydney Harbour Bridge. There are scenic helicopter flights over Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House with Sydney Harbour Heli \u2013 Flight, check out their website at www.sydneyhelitours.com.au or fly in seaplanes with Sydney Seaplanes at website: www.seaplanes.com.au Sydney Harbour Bridge throbs with much activity on the bridge with about 160,000 vehicles crossing daily; on top of the bridge where bridge climbs are conducted and under the bridge where one can get a side view and of the under carriage of the bridge by taking one of the boat cruises or sailing under the bridge. Sometimes during a boat cruise, dolphins swim alongside the boat, so wonderful to see. On several occasions, the bridge has been closed for charity walks and charity runs. The highlight for any adventurous visitor to Sydney is to do the Bridge Climb. Catering for people of all ages and abilities, check out their website at www.bridgeclimb.com/FAQs/Gift-Certificate-FAQs/ to get answers to FAQs. Once a year on New Year\u2019s Eve, Sydney Harbour Bridge is transformed into one of the most magical places in the world with the fireworks display. For over the past ten years the fireworks display has been designed by pyrotechician Fireworks Director Fortunato Foti. Over 1.6 million people from all over the world gather around the Sydney Harbour foreshore to watch this sensational show which is telecast to the whole world. The spectacular fireworks light up and sparkle in a multitude of glorious colours with beautiful designs that fill the night sky that one has to see to believe. With simulcasting of the sound tracks the fireworks dance in rhythm to the bursts of fireworks. The theme for the fireworks display changes every year. Revellers gather to enjoy and party the night away with lots of joy and laughter to bring in the New Year. To watch this extravaganza live from the Sydney Harbour Bridge, come join us on New Year\u2019s Eve for at least once in a lifetime experience."

The husband of the couple is a structural engineer and on about 5 of the days they holidayed with us in Sydney, he went and looked at and analysed the bridge from an engineering aspect for an hour or so before they continued on their sightseeing trips for each day!

You can drive on it, walk across it, catch a train across it and even climb the bridge! If you want to see all of Sydney in a day with ultimate 360 views, I advise taking the bridge climb. the view from the top is amazing and you can even see as far out as the blue mountains. Take some warm clothes too because it is really windy. if you are uncomfortable taking the bridge climb, walk across the bridge. Many of our staff members at Tile Factory Outlet have done the walk and advise taking a good pair of walking shoes and a bottle of water. Once you cross the bridge to the north side, there are a few good little boutique eateries and cafe's at Milsons Point. If you have the kids with you, take them to Sydney's amusement park, Luna Park. Guranteed fun day out. If this was helpful to you please leave a helpful vote."

You can easily walk from the City to North Sydney and back whilst enjoying some of the most spectacular views of the Harbour, the Opera House and Fort Denison.If you cross from the City side to North Sydney you will actually exit at Milson's Point where there are numerous coffee shops and restaurants. For those who want an easy ride back, catch the train from Milson's Point station back to Wynyard or Town Hall and you are back in the heart of the City."

Not many people know about this spectacular Sydney Harbour lookout.Find the stairs that lead up to the bridge on Cumberland Street (see right). You can take the walk from Circular Quay up Argyle Street through \u201cThe Rocks\u201c. If you are feeling thirsty stop at the L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u Keller for a litre of European beer. Go up Argyle Street then turn right up \u201cArgyle Stairs\u201d. You will come out next to the Glenmore Hotel.If you are still thirsty, hungry or require Australian beer go up the stairs inside the Glenmore to the rooftop bar that has great views of Circular Quay & the Opera House. The food here is usually good. Another pub very close by is the Australian Hotel with some beers brewed onsite.Take the \u201cBridge Stairs\u201d almost opposite the Glenmore Hotel up to Sydney Harbour Bridge pedestrian crossing. Walk about five minutes North along the bridge walkway until you reach the pylon. There is a signposted access entry.There are around 200 stairs up to the lookout with three main levels. The first level is where you pay the ($11 Adults, $6.50 Concession, $4 Children 5-12 years) entry fee with movie theatre room & information displays on the construction of the bridge. It is surprisingly big on the inside of the pylon.Level two has a balcony on both sides, only the Western side is accessible. Also toilets & a gift shop.On the way up to the top a couple of mannequins depicting workers are suspended from the roof top & a replica copy of the golden scissors used for the official (ribbon cutting) opening of the bridge.Inside the lookout level has further information panels & early images of the completed project. Outside the room on the lookout balcony can be be very windy.The balcony provides excellent views of Sydney Harbour, Opera House, Harbour Bridge & Circular Quay. The lookout is not quiet as high as the bridge climb peak, but here you can take & use your own camera.http://things-todoinsydney.com.au/sydney-harbour-bridge-pylon-lookout/"

Of course you can do the Bridge Climb at great expense if you wish but if you don't have the budget, and you want to go up, you can visit the South Pylon lookout which certainly gives you great views. Or you can walk across the bridge for free at any time. You can bicycle across or just sit in the top carriage of a train or bus and enjoy the views. Ferries run on Sydney Harbour from Circular Quay which is almost at the base of the bridge so its wonderful to get on the harbour and just sit back and relax as you admire this famous Coathanger. Its also a great sight to visit whether you are single, a family, a couple, kids, business, friends or whatever, enjoy!"

Not easy for a tourist as you need to find out how to access the footpath but once on the bridge you appreciate its size. The footpath is on the Eastern side of the bridge so you get a good view of the harbour and opera house. Next you can catch a train across the bridge. The railway is on the Western side of the bridge so you get views of the Blue Mountains in the distance (on a clear day). Cost of the train will depend whether you buy a single journey ticket or a combined ticket for train, bus and ferry. Finally you can climb the bridge. You need to be OK with heights and be able to climb a short but vertical ladder. as usual with outdoor experiences, the weather can play its part but the view is awesome whether sunny, windy, wet, hot or cold. If the bridge is an icon then the Bridgeclimb is something you have to put on your bucket list! Forget all those big Ferris wheels in London and Singapore, this is in another league."

Doing a bridge climb is an amazing experience and not nearly as scary or strenuous as some people may think so if visiting Sydney it is well worth considering. But a climb can be a bit expensive for a family and there is also age restrictions. A cheaper option and one our family has done a few times is to catch the train to Milsons Point and walk back across the bridge to the city. There is a bench seat at the half way mark to take in the view and then you can visit the South Pylon Lookout. Climb the stairs up to a small museum and lookout. There is a fee but it is no where near the price of the climb and it's a good view. Then head on down to The Rocks or Circular Quay for a nice meal."

The bridge offers such a great look back into Sydney and other parts of the harbor. The water taxi's and ferries are constantly going in and out. The is so much to take in. Walking across the bridge is not the same as climbing the bridge. Walking is free, climbing is expensive. As your walking across you will come to the Pylon lookout. For 11AUD you get to walk up 200 steps up into the stone structure. There is a museum and outside lookout that is outstanding. This little find is pure gold. Easy to over look so don't miss it. It wasn't crowded either. Make this a part of your travels as you visit Sydney, Australia."

I have been living in Sydney for more than a year now and I have seen this bridge hundreds of times but it's beauty still amazes me each time I visit. I have traveled under the bridge by ferry, on the bridge by walk, bus and train and even I flew over the bridge by helicopter and each view of the bridge is just amazing. The bridge effect during the New year's eve midnight fireworks will last forever in your memories. I know it is a mere steel and concrete structure and is not one of the tallest or longest bridges in the world but still it is one of the most beautiful bridges in the world. I strongly recommend a visit to this bridge if you get a chance."

It's possible to go higher in a helicopter, but in my opinion the climb up Sydney Harbour Bridge is not all about the view, its about the walk and being on THE bridge. We did the Express Climb, which takes you through the bridge's structure rather than just over the top, so to mind, more interesting. We were told that to do the Express Climb you needed to have a good level of fitness but we found it quite easy even though we wouldn't consider ourselves fit as fiddles. Our guide was very experienced, patient and friendly. She certainly helped make the trip as enjoyable as it was.You really do need to pinch yourself on this activity, that you are actually on Sydney Harbour Bridge! I don't think the experience could have been made any better by any other means; the activity is a very well oiled machine! The photos taken are very well done and pretty good value. It helped that we went on a blue sky day.Totally recommend this trip."

A short walk around the Boardwalk from the Park Hyatt (where I recommend you stay) yields sweeping views of the bridge. :) You can take tours that will walk you over the bridges trusses...or you can walk along the pedestrian walkways for nice views as well...either way, you won't regret the time it may take you to incorporate this into your itinerary. :)"

Sometimes I just sat and looked at it. This bridge is so iconic and, coupled with the Opera House, sums up Sydney."

The bridge carries pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, bus and train commuters and is an important lifeline to the posh northern suburbs. The photo opportunity both of the bridge and from the bridge of the Sydney harbor and the Opera House is fantastic. The general design was prepared by Dr J.J.C Bradfield and officers of the NSW Department of Public Works, while the detailed design and crucial erection process were undertaken by the contractors consulting engineer Mr (later Sir) Ralph Freeman of Sir Douglas Fox and Partners and his associate Mr. G.C Imbault. All this history and a lot more can be found out while visiting South Eastern Pylon for the bridge climbing.

If you're seeing it for the first time then I would get the train to Milsons Point and walk across so you get to see the views from the bridge of the opera house. Then you can view the bridge when you get round to the Circular Quay area. Or, if you take a ferry to Manly, you get really good views of the whole lot. Do it on a sunny day and you'll get some good pictures. Oh yeah...and if you're lucky enough to be there on NYE then you get to see one of the best firework displays on the planet.

This would have merited 5 stars from me without doubt, were it not for the extortionate cost of doing any of the actual climbs. You can see the pricing on their website. It is a beautiful construction (made in Middlesbrough, England and shipped over) and you can view it from numerous places especially the Opera House and some of the ferries. Day or night it is an awesome sight. What you can and indeed should do for free, is to walk across it. Allow reasonable time as you'll want plenty of photo stops. There is a dedicated footpath which shares the bridge with about 8 lanes of traffic, railway tracks, and a cycle path. You'll get fine views of the harbour including the Opera House, Circular Quay etc. Interestingly considering how exposed it is you still get a heady intake of exhaust fumes, but don't be put off by this. I was amused by the numerous security guards on duty, presumably to stop jumpers. I'd observe that you'd have to be pretty determined as the entire walkway is fringed with an arch of fencing that has a barbed wire dressing on top. Despite these last two points, I'd still award 5 stars were it not for the charges. Along with the Opera House this is a Sydney must-do."

Having lived in Sydney 10 years ago for 4 years the bridge is not a new sight for me but I'd never walked it. I chose this option after seeing the extraordinary cost of the official climbs though if I had an overflow of disposable $ or was a foreign tourist looking for an adventure I would probably splurge for a climb up high. Given the walk is free, not crowded, offers amazing views of Opera House, a docked cruise boat, the harbour, government house & Kirribilli you really must consider this activity as part of your trip or a fun & family friendly activity. Looks like some people have tried to start up the trend of placing locks on the safety wire installed, like the famous Parisian bridge but its not taken off and the random locks look a bit silly. The safety wire is also at an awkward eye sight height but you can peek through with effort for a clear view.I would top it off with an upmarket pub meal at the Glemore pub on the other side & a stroll around the Rocks & Circular Quay."

We got an early start, parking in The Rocks area, which is also beautiful and we walked up to the bridge entrance and embarked on a tour of the bridge itself. For the adventurous, check out the Bridge Climb outfit, that gives you full mountain climbing gear and walkie-talkies and allows you to literally climb onto the bridge structure (takes like 3 hours). We stuck to the pedestrian walkway. The views are just stunning! Looking back at Sydney Harbor and all of the other landmarks such as the Opera House is great. Wonderful photo opportunities abound. The bridge is just a few years older than the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge, and the walk is lovely but I was missing the unimpeded views from San Francisco, since the GG Bridge does not have a \"cage\" surrounding the walkway. And yes, more people jump for that reason. At Sydney, the walkway is almost surrounded by fencing, but they do at least leave a little space open to look and take pictures. Since the bridge is beautiful it is a must-do activity to walk it when in Sydney. We were a bit too early to enter the pylon to go to the top of the support for even better views. But note that, like most things in Sydney, this is a for-fee part of the bridge - costing $11/adult. It opens at 10am."

Certainly, there are great views but you will be constantly reminded of the nearby traffic. The more interesting walks are on either side of the bridge. There is a bridge climb that we did not do (it is quite expensive). We also did not do the tower near the middle of the bridge that also charges a fee."

At first we were lost in how to get to the level to walk across it. But after several minutes we found our way and off we went. The walk across the bridge is amazing. The view of each side of the harbor is beautiful. If I wasn't tired due to lack of any sleep the night before, I would have asked my partner that we explore the other side of harbor. We considered doing the Bridge Climb, but I am glad we walked across instead. Being tired, I would not have lasted the bridge climb. But this was a better choice. Beautiful views and it's free."

A local told us about this after I was afraid to do the bridge climb. They were right on the money. The Pylon Tower has all of the history of the making of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. From how much money was spent, to how long it took and crazy photos of the brave men who risked their life everyday just going to work on the bridge.

Make sure you pick a clear, sunny day because the views of the city, Circular Quay, the Opera House etc are stunning. Certainly the best place to take pictures of the Opera House. We were not keen to do the climb, neither of us were brave enough, but we did climb the Observation Pylon. Well worth the $11 each with fantastic views of the whole harbour, as well as a bit of history on how and why the bridge was built."

We started at Milson's Point - a short walk or train ride from North Sydney - up 60 steps to bridge's well enclosed walking path. On a nice afternoon the path is packed with tourists, walking commuters, and people of all ages out for stroll. On the Milson's Point side, the walk first overlooks parks and trees, and then, of course, the Harbor. The view is spectacular... the Opera House, of course, ferries, and we went, a huge ocean liner pulling into Circular Quay. The walk over the bridge is not long at all - maybe 20 minutes. On the other side, you land at The Rocks - the drop off point of the original convict settlers. It is an easy walk to the many Rocks dining spots, down to Circular Quay for Ice Cream, trains, ferries, or buses to continue your Sydney exploration."

Then a series of ladders, suspended in the void, with the water below and the sky above. You reach the arch, and you start walking up. The ascent is not so difficult, easy most of the time, now you are far from the streets, people are just small indistinguishable faces, the cars below are small too, nothing above you anymore and around you can see the entire harbor. The opera house, circular Quay, Taoranga, the sail boats, the ferry moving around. It's just fantastic. We were lucky, the day was glorious, the sun perfect and the breeze refreshing.

While on the bridge you get an excellent view of the entire harbour, and if walking from south to north, looking back, you get an outstanding view of the Opera House and the Sydney skyline in the background. The first several hundred metres of the bridge has small steel beams that may get in the way of the perfect picture, but mid-way it opens up much more. On the either side of the bridge you can climb up to the top of one of the pylons (about 200 stairs) and it gives you a great vantage point of the harbour. If you're feeling up to it, you can do the bridge climb for around $200 Aus dollars. Overall a great walk with some spectacular views!"

It's that good.I usually start in The Rocks. This time, I started at Circular Quay, took the elevator up to the street level overhead, and walked straightaway to the bridge from there. It was actually easier that way than finding the entry from The Rocks. The bridge itself is a bit of an architectural masterpiece - the longest steel arch in the world, or something like that. There is a tour you can take inside one of the bridge supports that describes the construction. I didn't do that tour this time, but have in the past, and it's worth doing.The real treat is walking in the open air with the Opera House and Sydney Harbour stretched out in front of you. The walk along the top structure and arch (you know, the one Oprah did) is by reservation and costs $200+ and requires a sobriety test, but the walk across the pedestrian part of the bridge is free."

Plenty to do in Sydney from visiting the famous Bondi Beach to the sights of Kings Cross. So many lovely bars and restaurants, the Opera house and Chinatown were all on our agenda.Stayed at the Bayview Boulevard hotel which is in walking distance to the train station at Kings Cross and we walked pretty much everywhere we needed to go, except Bondi but the train and bus systems were excellent. I would definitely go back and stay at this hotel, very comfortable and friendly staff too. Loved Sydney, my first time there but wont be my last!"

When you have taken your harbor cruise, shopped for opals and had \"pancakes on the rocks\", a walk along the iconic Harbour Bridge is a must. It doesn't cost anything unless you pay for a tour (which I wouldn't recommend unless you are up for a physically demanding and pricey \"Climb the Bridge\" adventure), and it will help you work off some of the pancakes. The view is lovely, and if you pay around $10 US you can climb to the top of one of the bridge pylons. I chose not to pay the fee, as the view from the bridge is still very good for photography. There are small restaurants and pubs on the other side of the bridge, but no real attractions unless you are going to the Luna Park amusement park (about which I know very little other than parts of it were transported from Melbourne in the 1930s)MOBILITY: If you are in a wheelchair or have reduced mobility, getting on to the bridge can be a difficult and time-consuming effort which I probably wouldn't recommend.

It is however, a long bridge...and it's still in use. So while walking on the bridge is a good experience with a nice scenic view of the harbour and the Opera house--the novelty soon dies off, and what you're left with is a long walk on a bridge with traffic and dust and exhaust fumes.So while I recommend it (you really can't go to Sydney without going to the Bridge), don't have too high hopes on it."

Follow the signs or ask someone in the Rocks area to find where the stairs are to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and then take a twenty minute stroll one way and enjoy the best view (and its free) of the Harbour and Circular Quay and the Opera House. On the other side have a coffee by the water and if your tired take the ferry back to Circular Quay or walk back the same route. The Rocks area has great little eateries and a wonderful button shop on Nurses Walk. The area first settled by convicts is home to the Rocks Markets on the weekend where you can see craftspeople sell their creations. If you havetime take the ferry to Manly where you enjoy the quiet beach of the Harbour or the ocean beach on the other side. A great day by foot and if you dont want to spend any money then you can enjoy yourself as much as if you did."

Many views can be had from a distance but size best appreciated by walking around the base of the pylons on either side and walking (east side) or riding a bicycle (west side). I think the best way is to start from the city side and after you get to the northern side, you can either take a train back into the city (Milsons Point station on the northern bridge approach) or a ferry (from near Luna Park). Then there's the bridge climb where you walk across the top of the arch from the south side to the centre and back - you're attached to the bridgework by a harness that makes it completely safe. The complete walk (including 'safety instruction' takes about 90 minutes or so - a bit pricey - very popular and you may need to book ahead - walks may be suspended in high winds and bad weather."

The other time to see it in all it's glory is when it is all lit up at night. You can view it, climb it, drive or easily walk across it! Great vantage points are from The Sydney Opera House or from one of the many ferries that take you across the harbour to places like Manly or Taronga Park Zoo. There is no need to pay for an expensive Harbour Cruise as you get the same view when you take the Public Transport Ferries. From the city you can catch a train over the bridge to Milson's Point Station and walk back over the bridge to Circular Quay. I think this is the best direction to walk over the bridge as when you walk you can take in the sights of the Sydney skyline and the magnificent opera house."

The Pylon Lookout is located at the southeast pylon. To get to the lookout, you pass through a museum dedicated to the history of the Harbour Bridge. To get to the top where the lookout is, you will have climbed about 200 stairs - but you take your time and look at the exhibits along the way. Well worth it! The walk across the bridge is also an enjoyable outing."

The pylon climb costs $12 and you can take some great photos of Sydney Harbor with 360 degree views. The bridgeclimb experience costs about $200 and they dress you in an overall suit and take away every single piece of personal property from you so nothing can fall from the bridge.

She tried to explain there were stories and history to share. But I kept reasoning...The hike isn't that far. Less than an hour into the hike, I discovered why. The first morning hike (unless you do sunrise) for that day was at 9:00. We were in the second group at 9:35am. Before we were ever fully geared up, we were on the heels of the first group. That continued the entire time. The guide made us stop to look at rivets, and boats, and whatever else the guide could come up with because of the group in front of us. This continued until we reached the top--where the people doing the higher beam hike cross paths with the people doing the express hike--pretty soon we're surrounded with four groups of 14 people each. And we have to all keep stopping to have our picture taken so they can make additional money off the add-on photos. So combine too many people, with annoying pictures, and suddenly this magical hike feels more like a cattle migration--slow, crowded, and unpleasant. The views are great (but you can find similar views elsewhere). But if you're going to book this: ONLY BE IN THE FIRST GROUP OF THE DAY. IF YOU CAN'T BE IN THAT GROUP--DON'T DO IT. IT'S NOT WORTH THE $200-PLUS A PERSON. The owners are trying to maximize profits and with revenue exceeding $40 million a year--they're doing it--by packing people into a slow, delayed, annoying experience.Be first, or skip it."

I had heard from various people that the bridge climb was a waste of money but after looking on trip advisor and seeing all the rave reviews I decided to do it! I was very disappointed. It's very professionally run and the guide was enthusiastic and told us about the bridge which is really interesting as is being able to see the engineering of the bridge up close. However, you go through about 45 minutes worth of introductions, safety briefing and getting changed and then do the climb/walk which is not remotely scary as you're nowhere near the edge and have high railings either side of you. I would describe it as \"just a walk up a few hundred flights of stairs and a nice view\" - definitely not worth $218!!! The views from the bridge were great but I felt like I'd gotten a much better appreciation of the harbour and views of it all by going on a cycle tour of the city and seeing the harbour and indeed the bridge from loads of different angles!! Much better!!!! You can't take cameras up the bridge. You are given a free group photo at the end but the photos they take of you individually or as a group are very expensive to buy.

The views are amazing without the big $200 or more price tag attached. Just don't do what some people have been doing of late - attaching a padlock to the mesh. Such behaviour is not only destroying the enjoyment of the bridge for others, this is not China or Rome. It is Sydney. If you walk from the South to the North, you will be rewarded by the best views of Sydney (from under the bridge on the North side) and if you do it at night, Sydney glistens. You can also walk around Luna Park, catch a ferry back to Circular Quay or get the train back into the city or walk back into the rocks. Put on some sensible walking shoes and be open to experience views of Sydney city and across the harbour the postcards boast about."

Before climbing the bridge we checked the sunset time and timed the climb so as to be at the top as the sun set.The initial briefing took about an hour from arrival. It entailed chanding into special climbing gear and being briefed. The gear supplied included a special clip that attached to a stainless steel cable that wasnt able to be removed from start to finish. Detail to safety was first class. The main walkway on the bridge is quite wide and even though I dont like heights, I wasnt the least concerned.We climbed from the city side in beautiful blue skies and had fabulous views of the Opera House and up and down the Harbour. As we reached the top the sun set and the city lights came on for our climb down. FANTASTIC!We were fortunate that our day was sunny and an ideal temperature. For this type of weather it is best to pick April or September. Although in these months it can still be quite wet. Unfortunately the tours operate in all weather conditions.Overall (as we live quite close to Sydney and visit regularly) this has been the best tourist experience we have done in Sydney. However, it is quite expensive! I believe the operators now run dusk tours and charge more for them.If you find this is too expensive- you can always walk or bike across the bridge for no fee. There are still lovely views of the Opera House and Harbour."

I did the Harbour Bridge Climb with the wife and friends, none of us are young uns and one has a fear of heights, gets wobbly standing on a chair, but had no issues doing the climb, you just feel so safe. From the amazing guides who put you at ease and have a wealth of knowledge, the professional preparation area, the bridge experience itself and the final wrap up it was well worth the money.If you can, book a tour that finishes during twilight so you see the lights in the city and the sun go down as you come down from the top of the Bridge.I want to go back next year and do it at night as it would be spectacular."

We started the climb during daylight & got a view of Sydney harbor, the Opera house & the city in daylight. The sun set during our climb so we also got to view all the same things at night as well. The climb was easy & not scary. The guide was excellent. This was our favorite thing in Sydney!"

They try to break it up with photos and history talk but there is only so much they can do. All in all with the safety talks/getting dressed in the gear they provide/practice/the extended start and stop walk + buying pics at the end the whole experience lasted 4 hours. To get to top of bridge and back could be done in half an hour so felt like a wasted day but the bridge and it's views are breathtaking. Glad to say i've done it but they need to speed things up."

This review is specifically about crossing the Sydney Harbour Bridge (free) - this does not review the climbing tour experience ($$$!).I have crossed the Sydney Harbour Bridge several times as part of various running paths around Sydney. Accessing the pedestrian bridge is a bit tricky from the Rocks area - one can follow the bike path uphill to find the covered stairs. Once taking the stairs, note that the entrance is not at the top of the stairs, it is one level before the top.The walk is easy and does provide a fantastic photo opportunity of an \"aerial\" view of Sydney Harbour and the Opera House. Note, one would have to take shots between the protective fence links. There is a pylon about halfway across the bridge which one can climb to obtain additional views. The path is safe and there is always a guard at the pylon view.Because the bridge also provides access to cars, I do not enjoy the experience as much because of the fumes/exhaust. This is worth one visit for the photo opportunity, but there are several other Sydney sites to visit that are more enjoyable."

I have lived in Sydney for over 10 years now and I am still blown away by the Harbour Bridge - I love seeing it from different angles and it is still thrilling for me when I catch a glimpse of it through the highrises in the city or when driving towards it from the North Shore. There are so many ways to experience the Bridge - a walk across it on a sunny Sydney morning is glorious and offers fantastic views of the Harbour and the Opera House; for the more adventurous, the Bridge Climb is a must, giving interesting information on the history of the Bridge and its construction as well as some even more impressive views over the Harbour, city skyline and Opera House; walks near Mrs Macquarie's Chair and also the Observatory Hill provide fabulous views of the Bridge itself.I've just read some other reviews and have realised that I've been waxing eloquent about the Bridge itself, when I am supposed to be reviewing the Bridge Climb... so here is a bit more about the climb itself which I did a couple of years ago. While a bit pricey, it is definitely worth doing - both by people who are on their one and only visit to Sydney and by residents of the city. What's great about it is that the Bridge Climb operates in all kinds of weather except during electrical storms. So whatever the weather, you will be guaranteed a unique perspective of the city. The guides are very knowledgable, confident and able to answer all sorts of questions about the Bridge. You are not allowed to carry your own cameras, but the guides take some cheesy shots of each climber/couple/group so you will still have a memento of your climb."

I was initially somewhat anxious about the height but I felt very reassured by the professionalism of the pre-climb orientation and our guide so the height wasn't a problem at all. Did a 1pm climb and blessed with the perfect weather, middle of winter but almost no wind and sunny, awesome views. It was so good I'm planning to do it again at twilight.I was very impressed with the professionalism and attention to safety and detail - I felt safe at all times. A complete orientation beforehand prepares you for the climb. You will be breathalyzed and must have a 0.00 BAC.Took approx 3 hours in total & it just flew. There are a couple of ladders and lots of stairs but very gently sloping so it's a fairly easy climb. One of our party was nearly 70 and had no trouble.Wear comfortable shoes, runners or sturdy walkers. You will be provided with a suit and all weather jacket. See the website it gives comprehensive details.A bucket list must do - awesome experience - worth every cent."

Great views towards the east (Opera House, Circular Quay, Fort Denison, Mrs Macquarie's Chair and the Heads) from the Bridges' eastern walkway (bicycles are only allowed on the western part of the Bridge). The walk from one end of the bridge to the other takes 30-45 minutes depending on how many stops you make to take photographs. One of the best views of Sydney Harbour and Sydney city is from the Harbour Bridge. Keen photographers should consider a walk across the Bridge but do so in the late afternoon as the westerly sun is behind you. The sun is directly in your face in the mornings so photography is not the best at that time. There are cafes, restaurants, shops and hotels (public bars) on both sides of the Bridge so hunger and thirst can be quickly quenched after the walk. May to July is probably not the best time to visit as it may get windy and cold. The tourist cruise ships visit in the summer months and many dock at the Overseas Passenger Terminal at Circular Quay. A great view of the cruise ships can be obtained from the Harbour Bridge walk."

They offer a host of climbs depending on your time and interest. We took \"The Bridge Climb\" which takes a little over 3 hours (1 hour of preparation and a little over 2 hours on the bridge). They also have an \"Express Climb that takes about 2 hours and is a bit more strenuous. We had a really great time. Our guide Kate was fun and really informative. She really enjoyed her job and made our climb a great experience. The climb in not hard at all as we had a number of seniors with us and they had no problem with the level of exertion. You don't have to worry about the height as the bridge is so massive you don't really feel like you are that high (you are also tethered in). The views are fantastic and the information about the bridge was very interesting. If you have the time while in Sydney it is a great family outing."

It will take at least an hour and you will be tired from doing the trip, but if you have the time and the health you really should take a stroll across the Bridge.Three options are recommended:1) Take a Ferry from Circular Quay to Luna Park and then walk up to the Milsons Point train station. Get on the Bridge there and walk across towards Circular Quay. You will come out on The Rocks area.2) Take a train over to Milsons Point station. Get on the Bridge there and walk across towards Circular Quay. You will come out on The Rocks area.3) The opposite way to 1 and 2 above, which is to start at The Rocks and walk over to Milsons Point.The view is spectacular all the way across, but be sure to have some warm clothing if you are doing this in the evening/night in winter. It can get very cold. This walk will probably give you the best photos of the Sydney Opera House you can get. You can even climb up the Lookout Point half-way through. But be warned, it is 200 steps to the top! So you need either a healthy constitution or a lot of patience and determination."

Bradfield in the 1920's to 30's with engineering ability to consruct something like the Sydney Harbour Bridge....in era a of a few cars the Bridge was built to cater for cars,trams and trains is still coping with Sydney traffic with help from the Harbour tunnel.....Do the \"Bridge Climb\" if you can....or else just walk over or around and appreciate the marvel that we have here in Sydney...No current politician would even dare to approve a project on this scale and expense-but it has served us well for 80 years..."

We walked over it for free and enjoyed great views of the Sydney Opera House, the Harbour and the bridge itself.We debated whether or not to do the bridge climb, but the fact that you can't bring your own camera (and honestly, I think their reasons are bogus; cameras can be clipped to you so they don't fall!) stopped us from spending the $200 each to do it. We have no regrets because the views we got just from walking over the bridge were fantastic. Definitely take the time to do this!"

It's totally free. $11 ($6.50 concession & $ children) if you want to climb up the pylon on the southern side for a birds' eye view.Walk on the eastern side and if you are only going to do the walk one way, walk from Milsons' Point to the city, so the Opera House & cityscape are in front. The northern entry is via steps just south of the Milsons Point railway station, on the eastern side. Don't walk on the western side - that's for cyclists only. Really. They fly along the narrow pathway and it's dangerous for them and any unwary (or stupid) pedestrians who venture onto it.The elevated view gives a new perspective to the buzzing harbour, with ferries, sailing and motor boats of all sizes passing the Opera House and under the Bridge. The sails of the Opera House glisten in the sunshine and the much maligned \"Toaster\" melts into insignificance when you can see the Botanic Gardens from this height.The exit on the southern (city) side is via steps onto Cumberland street and it's only a few minutes' walk to the Rocks Market.With lots of stops for photos and \"WOW\" moments, it took me 20 minutes."

The tour was well run and our group size of 9 was good. It's a must do whilst in Sydney, although it is quite pricey, but hey it's a one off."

I definitely recommend doing the bridge climb.You get properly harnessed up and then do a practise small assault course, to make sure you know how to move your harness around efficiently.You are connected by your harness at all times.... so don't be worried about falling because it's impossible to do that! The views form the top are just amazing!! and don't worry if you don't feel your physically ready for it. anyone can take part and I've seen many elderly people going up there so if they can do it you can! There are steps quite a lot of the way up but I didn't even feel like they were an effort, I was too busy looking at the views around me. It is quite expensive but I think it's definitely worth it.... once in a lifetime experience and all that!hope this helps :)"

Safety is is taken very seriously. We were provided with headphones so it was easy to listen to our guide.Do take time either before or after the climb to visit the theatre and exhibits where you check in. Ticket also includes free admission to the tower where you can learn more about the bridge, get a great view, take photos and say hi to the climbers as they go by.Their photos are expensive to buy but you cannot take your own camera with you on the climb.I would certainly do this climb again when next in Sydney.Andrew"

It was built during the depths of the 1920s recession and kept many people in gainful empolyment during those difficult times. There is a really interesting museum on the Sydney side tower that is well worth a visit. Not too expensive and it has great historical records, photographs and artefacts. The view from the top of the tower is wonderful - you can shout across to the people on the bridge climb as they begin the ascent to the top.Love the fact that the towers at either end were built for show - they do not perform any structural purpose.Second only to the Forth Bridge in Scotland as one of the bridging wonders of the engineering world."

The pylon normally costs $10AU but because my son and husband climbed the bridge, we got 3 passes to do the pylon for free (not sure why I got the pass when I didn't climb, but I'm grateful). I then walked the bridge from one side to the other and back, snapping photos along the way. You can have a nice cuppa coffee in Kiribilli (which my local friends say is native language for \"really expensive real estate\") or stop in at a cute restaurant for lunch. The walk is a nice walk, and definitely worth it. If you climb the bridge, you cannot take any pictures, so you'd need to do the pylon anyway if taking photos is your intent."

Also, as you walk up the stairs, the history of the bridge and and its construction are displayed for those who are interested. Definitely worth it for 11$ if you want to see the view but not climb the actual arch. Great view of the Opera house from up top. Once you're back down, you can also just walk across the bridge itself to the other side; there is a pedestrian walkway. Watch for the runners that also use the path for their jog. Note: children will be able to climb the stairs but once at the top, the railings are high so depending on their height, they might not see anything unless in someone's arms."

But as a world traveller, it's even easier to understand the magnetic draw of this iconic structure that links Sydney's North and south. As a local, it's actually a pain to cross every day but as a visitor you will enjoy the crossing no matter what mode of transport you use. I recommend walking across from the Rocks to Milsons Point for a bite to eat, and then catching the ferry back into the city. It's not what most guide books would suggest but I think it's the best way to appreciate the harbour bridge from both the harbour itself and on foot. Another great trip is to take the ferry over to Balmain, walk up to the East Village pub for a tasty local meal and then ferry back. You get longer on the boat and see one of Sydney's premier suburbs that most visitors won't bother to visit."

There is a lot to see and do here in Sydney, and if this is the only pricy thing you do, fine, do it. But you can walk over it for free, take a ferry under it for a couple of bucks and even climb up the inside of one of the pylons (Sydney east side) for only $11.

You are called thru and told the procedures , then kitted out,including your cap and hankie .Off to the the practice climb,then thru the wall and then clipped onto the safety wire. The walk is easier than you think and very safe. the view is amazing ,to see the Opera House from the Bridge is very different. You walk halfway then crossover and comeback down the walk takes about two hours the whole visit three hours.If you are in Sydney you will go to see the bridge make the effort to walk it . Excellient value for a once in a lifetime experience."

Good reason for this! It is in the heart of everything and it is a good looking bridge. Moreovr, the bridge affords a world class view of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour. We decided to walk over the bridge to take in the views.It took us about 30 minutes which allowed us to stop frequently to appreciate the vistas. Coming back we walked about 5 minutes and caught the train coming back to the Circular Quay.There is an attraction where some folks even climb to the top of the bridge. We did not but it appears very safe from all reports we had. The best view of the bridge (as opposed to from the bridge) in our opinion was from the Royal Botanic Garden harbour walk.You can frame the bridge over the Opera House if you want a very memorable picture,"

Any vist to Sydney cannot exclude the harbour bridge, and the added luxury of walking across it, seeing the spectacular structure grow upon your eyes as you walk it's length, and note that it 80 years old, and is a riveted steel structure (no bolts!) adds to its beauty.Add the amazing height of the bridge, the spread of the view you'll have of the harbour and city, especially on Australia Day, seeing the activity of a busy harbour, ferries rushing across commuting people and the occasional freighter or passenger liner berthing at Circular Quay, or a naval ship coming into Garden Island, the harbour from the bridge is always amazing."

Not much up there, but terrific views and some salient facts about the bridge. I also watched a movie, which was interesting. You can see the \"Bridge Climbers\" from the Pylon (that's where the museum is). No, I did not climb the bridge! Anyway, it was raining, and I'm sure some of those climbers had booked online in hopes of a lovely day, but they were then committed, financially, and had to follow through or lose their \"investment.\" My husband dislikes heights, so he stayed down on the bridge and spent the hour speaking with one of the guards (they were friendly guards--probably work for the Chamber of Commerce!)."

The walk is a moderately based activity if you intend to walk the entire length of the bridge.The bridge is only walkable from (from the city) on the right hand side as the other side is a bike path. The walk can take 40 minutes or longer to the other side and return depending on how many pictures you take. The only steps necessary are the 3 flights up at the beginning of the trek and remaining portion is a gradual slope. The tower on the far side of the bridge is free and climbable. The view is similar to the top of the bridge for the paid climb. And additional 30 minutes for the tower is necessary.The free walk will give you great views and pictures of the harbor, Opera House and city. There is a climb which gives you an explanation of the bridge and Sydney. At 200$ this was not a value since the free climb of the tower was available. This is a great walk to plan before or after a lunch in the Rocks section of Sydney."

It wasnt a good day, drizzling with rain (and no coat) only a well worn umbrella we at the last minute decided to walk the bridge, it was spectacular even though misty, due to the weather we were not allowed to go over the top which I didint mind, there are 2 walks one along the side of the rail tracks and the big one over the top . One costs nothing the other does!which ever one you do you wont be sorry these views are spectacular and the size of the harbour is mammoth. Not suitable for small children walking or in prams too many steps.This is a must while in Sydney what a great place."

Driving (or taking the train, or walking, or cycling) across it is spectacular enough and rewards you with great view of the Harbour itself (although there will always be a safety fence between you and the view), but there are also two ways to see the bridge from a different angle. The first is to climb one of the bridge pylons on the south side of the bridge. Entry is cheap, and it gives you a great view of the city and the bridge itself. The other is climbing the bridge. Yes, climbing it! You will have to book in advance, and it costs several hundred dollars per person (more expensive around sunset time), but I found it very worth it - definitely an adventure to remember, and totally safe."

It is such a recognizable landmark whenever you see pictures of Sydney Harbor and you can think...\"I was standing on top of that!' I will caution that the climb can be strenuous. There were some in our group that were self-admittedly out of shape, but our guide took us up slowly, stopping to be sure everyone had enough time to rest before continuing. It should not be difficult for people of reasonable fitness level and ability. Very fun!"

The only negative are the wire protections which mar the photographs. You can get your camera through the gap, but it was impossible to get a shot of us and the Opera House or city skyline. Security guards were present 1/3 of the way across. There is always something different to see because of all the harbor activity. Sydney takes this bridge to heart. I overheard a local saying, \"I hate the cruise ships that come in because they make our bridge look small\" The bridge is not small.

So whilst it was pretty chilly up there, we were snug and able to enjoy the climb, and the view.

Well, what do you know; you walk up one side and down one side \u2013 not across. Apparently there are regulations on the side that limit the access.None the less the total experience was pretty interesting, albeit that I am sure it could be done in 2 hours and not 3 and half. We waited around quite a lot whilst on the bridge \u2013 for those groups in front.You can\u2019t take anything with you when you walk \u2013 nothing/nada. I even had to remove my Livestrong wristband?!We took the suggestion and only wore underclothes under the \u201cclimb suit\u201d we were given to wear.The planning and organization is something special and I have to admit, for me, that was the highlight. They have everything so well organized from the 1st minute you start \u2013 right to end and I commend the management on the strict adherence to the program.The walk is simple and the guide entertaining. On our day the weather was over cast and we had a little drizzle on top. It was no problem \u2013 still a great experience.Just allow enough time and afterwards, you can go to one of the towers and take your own camera to take great pictures of the Opera House \u2013 from up high."

While many will tell you about how good the Bridge Climb is, there is a far cheaper option. One of the pylons is open to the public for a small fee. Going to the top takes you back in history, with some historical displays, some original signage, and the lookout on top virtually as it was almost since the bridge first opened, giving you spectacular views of the main part of the bridge and Sydney. You can also walk right across the bridge at road level for no cost, which is fantastic to do. If you want to save yourself a couple of hundred dollars, this is a great alternative to the touristy Bridge Climb, and what's more you can take as many photos as you want on your own camera without having to pay a cent for the privilege."

You won't be disappointed. There are numerous places around the Sydney harbour foreshore where you can take a picnic and join the crowds to experience this wonderful firework spectacular. I suggest you get there around lunchtime and the fun you will have meeting the people around you, eating and drinking until the first firework display at 9pm. These are the smaller of the two shows but still the display is amazing. Fireworks are coming from several buildings in the city, different locations around the harbour and then at midnight the main fireworks start and again come from all directions around Sydney CBD and of course the bridge is the main focal point of interest. This year they were truly amazing. We also had an aerobatic flying display over the harbour just before the 9pm fireworks. The sight of all the boats moored in the harbour, the fireworks and the well controlled and happy crowd make it a must see."

There is a stairway to the walkway from there. The walk across the bridge takes about 30 minutes with lots of stops to admire the view.A trip by ferry under the bridge is also a must.

Before starting out on the climb, people are given special suits to wear and an intensive training for an hour or so on how to negotiate all the steps and ladders on the way up. No cameras or anything that can be dropped are allowed to be taken, and even we were shackled to a safety line that ran the whole way of the Bridge. The climb truly is exhilarating, and photos are professionally taken right at the very top, both as a group, and individually with the amazing backdrops of the city and Opera House. Do try this and make sure it's on your bucket list!!"

This truly is a unique view, as you can't go to the pylon lookout at night. Yes, it costs more, but you get to see the city in the daylight on the way up, then watch the sun set, see lights coming on, and then you have a night view. We were lucky enough to have a full moon that night, too! The Bridge Climb staff were great. We felt very prepared and safe. And we had fun! We did buy 2 of the pictures at the end because they turned out really nice. One was taken in daylight and the other was after the sun set. If you don't do the Bridge Climb, at least go to the pylon lookout. There are exhibits, too, so you learn a lot about the bridge and its history. I know the Bridge Climb guide gave us facts about the bridge, but I remember more from the pylon visit."

There are plenty of ways to see one of the world's most famous bridges, built in the 1920/30's, it is still considered as one of Australia's most significiant engineering feats.Take a ferry, boat, etc. under it, do a bridge climb over its arched top, but the cheapest way to do it (i.e. free) is walk across it's pedestrian walkway, next to the traffic lanes. You can access the walkway from the western end of Circular Quay by walking along George Street then up Argyle Street until you come across stone stairs that lead up to Cumberland Street. There is a signposted 'Bridge Stairs' entrance to a stairwell in a stone pylon that goes up to the walkway itself.Take time to soak in the views & if you want, the south pylon (the tall stone structure) has a lookout & exhibition open to visitors (entry fee payable). Keep on going across to the other end & down to Milson's Point, where you can reward your efforts with a short walk to Luna Park. There is a ferry terminal there too if you don't want to walk back!Interesting fact: looks can be deceiving, there is not one curved steel beam in the entire bridge."

If you walk from the Rocks side (South) go down to Milsons point and have a lunch or coffee. If you walk from the Milsons point side (North side) go down through Circular Quay and onto the rocks. Great views and there is always something happening on the harbour. If you have the time go up the Pylon on the South East corner of the bridge...the views are even better. It does cost a few dollars but is well worth the view. If you want to lash out do the Bridge Climb...well run and just the best way to see the harbour."

The 'pylon' contains a small but very interesting museum which gives you a good idea of what an engineering feat and feat of work the bridge itself is.

I wanted to do the bridge climb, but our budget for the trip didn't allow it, and my wife wanted nothing to do with that, so we decided to just walk across the bridge. We started in the CBD and walked to the other side and back. It's not a very long walk, it looks bigger than it actually is. It was sort of difficult to find the sidewalk that went up this way, but once you're on it you can't get lost. You are well separated from traffic while on the bridge, and there are no shortage of great views. Security guards are regularly patrolling the bridge and there are surveillance cameras everywhere. Combined with large fences and razor wire you have no ability to climb up on any part of the bridge. Once on the other side, there is a nice park to walk through that will take you under the pillars, so you can see the structure of the bridge quite well. it's also less than a 5 min walk from this point over to Luna Park. We sort of walked slowly and explored a bit, and the whole thing only took 2 hours or so. The nice thing is if you want to get a head start on your day, you can do this before anything else opens in Sydney. I would say this is a must-do."

My best friend and I travelled from the gold coast to do this. It was a friday night. During the day we were revving ourselves up as we were very nervous. Towards the afternoon it started to become very overcast and windy which didnt settle our nerves. Once we arrived at the bridge climb, the staff were extrememly nice and the lady in the shop was telling us about all of her trips up the bridge (9 times!). Anyway it came to about 4pm when we were taking into a room to fil out a pre-screen health thing and then we were suited up. This takes about 30 mins. We were introduced to our guide. (I wish I knew his name but he was very friendly). We headed out with about 8 people to start the climb. My friend and I were nearly sick with nerves now so we went up the front with the guide. As we headed out onto the bottom frame it was very cold and there was a horrible wind but we pushed past it. Let me tell you, the worst part of the climb was going up these horrible ladders. My mouth was dry, I felt sick and I was shaking something cronic. We waited about 20 mins fo everyone to come up. The next part is the easiest and trust me when I say this..the best! Your now on the outside of the frame. After the guide takes some pictures at different vantage ponints you pretty much walk in 3 parts up the bridge. You walk 1/3 and then wait for the rest of the group to have pictures and you continue up. I didnt like the part where you wait on your own and the guide is behind you but there are headets which you can talk through. I was still pretty nevous at this point but adrenelin had kicked in as well. We were holdng on extrememly tight to the railings as it was soo windy! the guide said it was about 70km/h and the ususally wont climb it after 80km/h. The top of the bridge is amazing. We got to catch the sunset and then we saw the beutifully lit city at night. Its beyond gorgeous. The decent is quite fast but the guide got us down quickly as the wind had picked up alot and we were all feeling very uneasy. We all had windburn and a bit of chill once we got back inside but its all good for the adventure you go on.Overall, it is a great experince. If you can do it, you have to. I will be returning to do it again. If your nervous, trust me they go away once you start admiring the scene around you."

It took 6 years to build, started on in 1926 and finished in 1931. They waited a year to open it. The total length of it is 1149 metre's. In 1976, the one-billionth vehicle crossed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The first 500 million crossings took over 33 years while the second 500 million took less than 11 years.You have to see and climb the Harbour Bridge.

To get to this lookout you first must use the Harbour Bridge pedestrian walkway - accessible either from the stairway just above Argyle Street at The Rocks, or you can follow the walkway all the way around from Cahill Walk (above Circular Quay). You enter through a door at the southern pylon tower. Entry is $11 for adults, cheaper for kids and concessions. Be aware there's lots of stairs! There's some historical tid-bits about the bridge, a short movie to watch on the way out, and a souvenir shop about half way up. Views from the top are wonderful - take your camera."

No visit to Sydney is compete without seeing the bridge--it's such an icon--but it is surprising how unfriendly and unpleasant that it feels to walk over the bridge. Unlike my 'home bridge' (the Golden Gate, another icon), the pedestrian pathway all along the water's edge isn't just a railing--it's a 10 foot (3 meter) high fence topped with barbed wire. This is in addition to police officers stationed all along it about every few hundred yards. It felt like a prison. You could only take pictures through a little 8 inch high gap in the railing and fencing. One can pay $$$ to climb the bridge, but this is not an option for families with younger children, and walking to the top of the pylon--apparently hundreds of steps and also $$--is also not really a reasonable option with younger kids. The bridge should be able to be enjoyed by all, not just enjoyed as money-making venture."

The Sydney Harbour Bridge itself is impossible not to see whilst travelling around in Sydeny, but to get the best of it, do the 'Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb'. Book online prior to travelling to avoid dissapointment as it gets quite busy. You arrive to an efficient and friendly welcome at the HQ underneath the bridge in The Rocks. You are then issued your climbing gear, treated to sfaety briefs and a short lesson on how to use the kit. The instructors are very friendly and professional and this short process only took around a half hour. You are then led out onto the bridge and commence your climb! We were in a goup or six + the instructor so the staff to visitor ratio was very good. The instructor tells you all about the bridge on the climb and has numerous annecdotes to keep you occupied. The climb itself is not really a climb - the girders themsleves are abour 5m wide and there are steps all the way with hand rails. Although exhilarating, its physically only mildly arduous - just prepare for a lot of steps! when you reach the top, the view is increadible and well worth the effort. To watch the traffic beneath you is also cool. There are a few climbs you can do. We did the express (2 hrs ish) and we found that to be plenty! Its not cheap (about $180 each) but the expense reflects the professionalism of the crew and I guess the high costs that they incur from insurance. A must do if your in Sydney."

We went up the pylon (if we\u2019d done this after the climb we\u2019d have had a free voucher but never mind) and I saw that the steps along the arch were solid steel and you couldn\u2019t see through them. As my vertigo kicks in when I can see through what I\u2019m stood on I started to think that maybe I could handle this after all. We went to the office to enquire about availability and to be honest, I thought I\u2019d get out of it as we were leaving Sydney the next day but no, they had plenty of availability so in a snap decision we signed up. I fretted for the whole night but I needn\u2019t have been so worried.As many people have noted this is not the cheapest activity in Sydney but you do get quite a lot for that. All in all it takes around three hours. You start by getting breathalysed then don the fetching gray jump suit with all accessories (gloves, hat, sunglasses etc) securely attached. Then there is training of how the bridge climb works and how you move around the various parts. Then it was time to go. As others have said, the hardest bit is the first part when you are under the bridge as it\u2019s a narrow cat walk though there are bars on either side. From there you climb up some ladders, through the road and emerge at the foot of the arch. I remember singing Patsy Cline\u2019s \u2018Crazy\u2019 to myself as I climbed up; there was no better song to fit the situation! Time for picture one. It got a lot easier once on the arch. It\u2019s so solid and safe. It\u2019s also shallow so I didn\u2019t find it an effort to climb. A second photo was taken half way up and then another two from the top. You can\u2019t take your camera with you and I found these pictures to be very expensive seeing as you are already paying a lot for the climb. The whole experience is narrated by your guide who you are attached to (as you are the rest of your group). Ours was brilliant and really brought the history of the bridge to life. Despite my trepidation I am so pleased that we did this. I have to disagree with another reviewer who think that you can get the same views from the path below. The Harbour Bridge is enclosed by wire fencing and the views aren\u2019t as good; there are also several lanes of traffic and trains so it\u2019s pretty noisy. From the top of the bridge you can see all over Sydney and to the ocean. It\u2019s the sort of activity that you do once but probably wouldn\u2019t do again on a repeat visit due to the cost and time involved but the photo from the top that is now on my fridge never fails to make me smile."

We then had lunch in Kirabilli and explored Luna Park and the surrounds before catching a ferry back a cross. It gave us a whole other view of the bridge - from underneath it!

There is something special about the way the curved interlaced girders look as you pass through and under them. The view if you walk isn't bad but not as spectacular as you would expect. For me the Brooklyn Bridge is the best viewing platform whereas the Sydney Harbour Bridge is the best for looking at.It is also good for looking at from under its North Pylon in particular and the foreshore parkland is a joy in its self. Whilst you can climb the arch for a fee, few are ecstatic about that afterwards. There is also a pylon with a museum, the SOuth East one but having been once I feel no need to repeat it, I am happy to wonder drive or ride across! Bicycles are permitted on the western side pedestrians on the Eastern!Takes about 20 minutes but allow more time as you have to get to starting and finishing points, say 40 mins all up."

For about $9- you climb 200 steps with stops along the way to learn how this beautiful structure came to be (and use the bathroom if needed). We were so surprised by what we didn't know about Sydney's famous bridge. At the top the 360 degree views are stunning with many photo opportunities. You can see almost as much from inside the room at the top without going out on the external viewing balcony. That is very good for people who are not sure if they can handle the height. I am a bit wobbly with heights and had to sit down a few times and retreat into the inside room until I felt like I could face the outside again. As someone who doesn't cope fantastically with heights I am so glad that I went up for the view. Make sure you stop and read the information boards and look at the models on the way up, they are very interesting and add to the whole experience. On the way down you go a different way and there is a short 8min? video of historical photos and events about the building of, and opening of the bridge.The next day we caught a ferry to Luna Park then walked back to The Rocks along the bridge. A large freighter ship passed under us along with many smaller vessels. I was quite excited by this (I know...small things....). Again the view was great. But also checking out the traffic lanes and passing traffic and saying hello to the ever present friendly security guards was all part of a lovely stroll across the harbour."

This attraction is not advertised as widely as one would expect, and it is not signposed that well.

We decided to do the lookout rather than the bridge climb since many reviewers on TripAdvisor said the views are very similar. I would tend to agree. We walked up the few flights of stairs to get to the end of the Harbour Bridge (it's not entirely easy to find the proper bridge approach - I recommend stopping at the Visitor Information Desk in The Rocks for specific directions) and then walked along the bridge walkway. Be careful that you don't go up one extra flight of stairs onto the highway portion of the bridge itself - that is not for pedestrians. From this end of the bridge, the lookout Pylon (and only the Pylon on the South Sydney side has a visitor lookout) is about a 15-minute walk. You enter and go up a few flights of stairs, pay your fee ($9.50 or $6.50 depending on whether or not you're a senior) and then climb 10 more flights of stairs (each flight 13 steps). There's a gift shop after 6 flights to stop at and rest benches at nearly every flight. At the very top, you walk out onto an enclosed balcony that affords beautiful views of the Harbour, Opera House, and City. You can see the people doing the Bridge Walk from here, which also looks fun, but is only about 50 meters higher than the Pylon lookout. After we took photo's and descended, we decided to walk across the rest of the bridge and have lunch on the North Sydney side of the bridge. Excellent choice -- the food is just as good and HALF the price as in the touristy side of Sydney!"

Can be accessed from Cumberland Street, The Rocks on the city side.The Pylon Lookout is open 10-5 everyday if you have a spare 30mins where you can ascend stairs to a lookout for b/w $4-$9.50 depending on age. Has a great pictorial history of the bridge & her special place in Sydney."

We also were disappointed that we couldn't take a camera on the bridge climb too. The view was great and it was cheap to get into. It was hard to find though...... From the Rocks, go along Cumberland street past the bridge climb place, and go up the stairs sign posted for Botanic Gardens. Along the side of the road and you will come to the pylon. You can also walk across the bridge and get the 'sydeny explorer' at the other side."

We did it on a Sunday, when traffic was less, and moving quickly. It actually might be better when traffic is congested - a bit quieter. Nonetheless, this free experience provides terrific vistas of the harbor and the Opera House, as well as the bridge itself, an impressive feat of engineering and design. While we enjoyed the walk across and back, we noticed those on The Bridge Climb. None of them was smiling, chained to their safety wires in their suits, looking a bit miserable and sweaty. While their wallets were much lighter, creating our own free experience lightened our hearts and spirit."

I am very surprised that TA has bunched up the 2 attractions together... each one offers a totally different experience.The Lookout is fabulous, inexpensive, and the views are great. The climb itself is not too tiring, there is a gift shop & rest area roughly half-way up. We enjoyed the Pylon's short video presentation about the history of the bridge, why the pylons were added though not needed during the construction.I would recommend this during a nice clear morning, the views are wonderful - sites are marked on the glass..."

For those wanting the cheap thrill, walk across the bridge, it is free with a great view. Tip: go in the morning and you will be the only one on the bridge. If you want to learn about the bridge without breaking your wallet then go up the Sydney Harbour Bridge Pylon Lookout. It is well worth the price and you get a great high up view of the city and the opera house. We did not do the Bridge Climb because it cost too much and took too much time."

            "review": "it grew on me..... At first I thought the Bridge a bit of a disappointment, looked old, like GW Bridge n NYC, not immediately impressive like Golden Gate or Verrazanno Narrows. But it grows on you and you get used to it being there as a background to most photos. One morning we started to walk across it (bottom road level walkway, not the climb across the top), great views although I could only do the first turret because of a foot problem. I would advise going a bit later in the morning to avoid the getting into the morning rush of walkers across the Bridge and to see the Museum. The Museum was not yet open when we were there. . A great view of the Bridge is from the streets behind the Holiday Inn outside the Info Center, from the park in front of the Hyatt (especially at night) , from Mrs. McQ's Seat at the Botanical Center and from the Darling Harbor Ferry as it passes under it. Lots of brave souls climbed across it on the high route, I would imagine the view to be spectacular."

            "review": "It is worth a walk across this bridge!. Two weeks ago, my 8 year old daughter and I walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. We were staying with friends on the North Shore so took a train to Milson's Point and walked up the stairs to the bridge. The walk is easy and flat and from end to end takes approximately 20 minutes. It is very popular with joggers. On this side of the bridge, no bikes, skateboards and the like are allowed. They must travel on the western side of the bridge, so you can walk the bridge without the fear of being runover! It is security patrolled and they have security cameras along the walkway. Makes you feel secure even to walk it at nighttime.My daughter and I also decided to do the Pylon Lookout, cost was $9.50 for me and $4 for her. We spent about 30 minutes inside, learning about the bridge (I've done the bridgeclimb in the past and alot of the info the guide tells you is in the Pylon Lookout) and going to the top. The views are spectacular.So, if money is an issue and you are undecided about doing the bridgeclimb, then don't miss the Pylon Lookout. You still get the fantastic views from the top, and it only costs a fraction of the price of the climb.At the end of our day in Sydney, my daughter and I walked back across the bridge to the Milson's Point train station. So we walked it twice. I thought it was well worth doing again and to see the sights at night from the bridge.If I can give one piece of advise, it would be to walk across this bridge and stop and take photos of the Opera House etc. I wonder why I hadn't made an effort to walk this bridge on my many other trips to the city. I'll definetely do it again, next time bringing my Aussie husband, who has never walked it before either."

            "review": "A must-see landmark with lots of different options. The Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of the two main things people know about Sydney if they have never been there, the other being the Opera House. It is an amazing structure which you need to take some time to enjoy. If you don't feel up to doing the bridge climb, which can be quite expensive, then there are several ways you can enjoy the bridge.1) BridgeClimb - Thought I'd mention this way anyway. This is by far the best way to experience the bridge. You spend about 2 hours on the bridge itself, plus another hour or so in preparation / leaving the base. You are shown something you can only experience in the climb. You see, and are told, all about the bridge and its construction as well as the surrounding area. It also provides the best views of the Harbour. Cameras aren't allowed but the climb leader has a camera with him with photos available after your climb. I highly recommend this option if you can.2) Pylon lookout - This is a much cheaper option if you're on a budget, or really don't like heights. It's in one of the 4 pillars (pylons) that border the bridge. There is a museum which tells you all about the bridge and some really good views from the top too. You have a good view of people doing the Bridge Climb too so if you're not doing the climb but know somebody that is then this is a good place to take a photo. The views from here are great - just not as good as BridgeClimb. BridgeClimb climbers get a free ticket for the Pylon lookout so you can do both and compare them.3) Harbour Cruise - You get some really great views of the harbour bridge from any boat on the harbour really. You can do morning coffee cruises, dinner cruises or one I found really good - a hop on hop off pass for several locations around the harbour.4) Circular Quay - If you're on a VERY strict budget and want to see the bridge for free then walk from the Opera House around to the other side of the quay and towards the bridge - youll get some great views. Probably the best view is from the elevated highway that goes along the bottom of the quay. There is a glass elevator that takes you up there - it's a popular walking route and provides some really good views of the quay and bridge.5) Cross the bridge - This can take some time as the walk up to the bridge itself is quite long but you get some good views of the bridge and harbour.6) Explorer buses - the red explorer bus crosses the bridge but its really too quick to see much of it or to enjoy the view. I would recommend it though as it's a city tour,7) Mrs MacQuaries Chair - The peninsula that contains Mrs Macquaries chair can be reached by a 20 minute walk along the bay from the Opera House or by using the explorer tourist buses. It provides some really great views of the Harbour, Bridge and Opera House and is a tourist attraction in itself.Whichever option (or options) you decide on make sure you spend some time to just enjoy the view or you'll be missing out on something special."

The pylon lookout is only $9, so cheap to get views as fanstastic as the bridge climb itself (I'd imagine it's just not as exciting). The bridge is amazing and can give some brilliant sights of Sydney. We also walked over the bridge and the area the otherside of Syndey City was lovely and quiet. We then took the ferry across to Darling Harbour. Well worth having a wander across."

            "review": "Pylon Lookout - cheaper than Bridge Climb with beautiful views!!!. We decided to go to the Pylon Lookout rather than doing the Sydney Bridge Climb. It was only $9.50, as opposed to $179 and up for an adult ticket on the Sydney Bridge Climb. This allowed us to take as many pictures as we wanted with our own camera (cameras are not allowed on the Bridge Climb) and the views were fabulous! I have not done the Bridge Climb so I can't comment on it, but from pictures that I have seen, I think the views from the Pylon Lookout are very comparable (I've attached some of mine), so if you don't want to spend a lot of money, it might be a better option for you, as it was for us!"

We went up at dusk (5 PM as it was winter) and it closed at 6 PM. Great views. Admission includes a short movie and stop at small museum. There is even a gift shop up there. The climb was not bad at all and there is a drinking fountain half way up. Walking out there was half the fun. Check it out."
