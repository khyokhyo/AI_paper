We visited about a dozen churches and cathedrals while in Paris and Notre Dame wins in the size category and her Gothic splendors are there for all to see, but she is not my favourite. We were lucky enough to see a procession of priests. TIP: Be quiet & respectful. People are worshiping. Easy to forget."

There are only about seats for 800 people and you can truly enjoy the space even though you can't walk close to the naves on either side.We heard a very beautiful concert of 14 pieces with three young singers from the choir school at the Cathedral accompanied with some numbers with an organist.The music was great and the cathedral was even better."

The lead light windows are incredible and so are the art works inside. Light a candle for a loved one. Tarnished only by the gift store inside which I thought was a bit tacky. There are heaps of great gift stores nearby and food aplenty. The line to climb to the top was around the block so we gave it a miss but spent some time walking around the outside of the cathedral and enjoyed the music of some local buskers.We caught one of the boats from the Eiffel Tower which was nice. Make sure your boat has an open top so you can get good pictures while you are travelling down the siene."

You cant buy advance tickets and the museum pass wont allow you to skip the line. They allow 20-25 people up every 30 minutes. I wanted in line for about 2-2.5 hours. This was the only attraction I had to wait in line for in Paris and it was worth it. The view from the top is beautiful and I was so happy to see the gargoyles up close. You can also see the large church bells."

Just skip this and spend time marvelling at other beauties this cathedral is offering, quite free of charge."

But honestly, it was much too crowded, people didn't respect the signs to be quiet out of respect, and there was an ungodly number of East Asian tour groups whacking people with those stupid selfie sticks. I don't really understand why people go to these places just to take a few photos without really looking or really seeing anything, just to say they were there but have no true experience. I found much better luck at the less famous cathedrals... On the way home one night I wandered into St. Germain l'Auxerrois and it was a beautiful experience. Maybe 10 people in the whole place, gorgeous old art, not a selfie stick in sight. I would have liked to see more of Notre Dame, but it was just too busy and frankly, too many people only there so say they had been and look cool on social media. Not worth the annoyance."

The exhibit and write-up about the construction of the place was interesting. I had not appreciated how much money and how long it took to build this place. The view of the building from the nearby bridge and the quarters is nice."

It is very long with some very nice side chapels with lovely stain glass windows, but it seems cold and foreboding inside with not much down the long middle aisle. After Labor Day, the line to get in was about 15 minutes and it did seem crowded inside. A walk around the entire building is a must, to see it from all angles as well as from the other side of the Seine where the vendors are. Do not miss the statue of Charles I outside and to the right(when facing the church. Be aware of the ladies with the clipboards asking for a donation. they are pickpockets. Do not give anything as they are looking to see where you keep your money."

Notre Dame cathedral is an architectural master-piece, is simply stunning and is a 'must see' if visiting Paris for the first time. You must plan to spend some time looking through the panels, ceiling and other unique works of art inside the cathedral; also, plan to spend time outside and in front of the cathedral entrance enjoying the views; lastly, if you are taking the Seine River Cruise, please do not forget to capture the view of Notre Dame Cathedral from the cruise - you will see a completely different perspective!Now a few tips on planning the visit: Since visiting the cathedral is free of charge, the line tends to be long (though it seems to move pretty quickly) especially as the day progresses by. I suggest visiting the cathedral after breakfast - the church itself is very accessible - it is located in the middle of the city, between two bridges over the river Seine; the cathedral is also surrounded by many cafes, restaurants - it will be easy to grab a bite after spending an hour to two hours in the cathedral."

Don't forget to walk behind the cathedral, where there's a small park with benches where you can enjoy a lunch and rest your feet.

I am sorry for the delay in writing this review as I was there in August 2015 but wanted to do so anyway...I had the pleasure of staying in an Air BNB ten blocks from the Cathedral so we were able to walk to Notre Dame each morning as we began our adventures. I had wanted to climb the towers but in the summer, the line was so extensive, that alas, I was unable to commit the hours it would have taken to do so. The line was literally a full city block long. I was able to enter the cathedral for an early morning visit and was able to show my children the rose window that is world famous. One cannot visit Paris without a visit to the Cathedral. It looks marvelous as its been cleaned...this is not new but when I was last in Paris in 1986, it looked nothing like it looks now. Seeing the cathedral from a Seine river cruise is also a MUST do! Stunning and a work of art not to be missed!"

It is free of charge and the line is always on the move, one waits about 15-20 minutes to gt in. To climb to the towers you have to pay, but i don't advice you to go unless you have strong legs because it is a steep ascend. Don't forget to photograph the gargoyles."

The gardens in the back are lovely as well. Visiting was, unfortunately, one of the most touristy things we did in Paris. The queue outside to enter the cathedral was long, but moved fairly quickly. There are merchants and beggars that harass the line, so watch your belongings. There was no entrance fee into the main area. I was excited to visit the top lookout of the cathedral, because it is covered by the Paris Museum Pass. Unfortunately, the Museum Pass allows payers to jump queues at each attraction EXCEPT the Notre Dame Tower. We didn't build in the 2+ hour wait that the line would have taken and had to skip it. The interior of the church was beautiful, but looked very similar to many other impressive church interiors I've seen. Every few minutes a loud reminder comes over a loud speaker reminding everyone to be quiet and plays a lot \"Shhhh!!!!\" noise. It was obnoxious, though it would temporarily quiet the loud tourists. There must be a better way to handle that though. The outside is a must see. The interior is a must see once."

The pictures, the sculptures the glass-paintings etc. are impressive. And the stories about and in this place are grandiose. The view on top of the bell tower over Paris is amazing. It's a great symbol of Christianity especially when all the bells are ringing.

However they were competing with the church wardens who were aggressively (and ironically) shouting at everyone to shush! The two seemed to be deliberately competing with each other which was just plain awkward.I was surprised to read other reviews that it was free entry \u2013 everyone was being ushered to the tills on my visit, and everyone was being charged. The audio guides were extra cost and easily the worst I\u2019ve used in years, being incredibly dull. Though the tour itself was pure disappointment with so many roped-off areas, bad lighting, and it being non-stop pushing and shoving all the way around.Considering that at times the tour was verging on preaching, it seemed a contradiction that there were so many places selling candles and tourist gimmicks.I\u2019ve enjoyed several cathedrals but sadly cannot recommend this one. If you're planning a trip to Paris, give this a miss."

The dramatic architecture is the wonderful buttressed walls and the spires. The outside of Notre dame is a view I haven't tired of while being in Paris.There is an excellent view of the church as you come from Ile St Louis and cross through the back garden."

The climb up the spiral stairs (all 388 of them) to the very top was a bit of a struggle, but the sensational views of Paris made it worthwhile. The photo opportunities are endless with so many angles to be captured in all directions. The inside of the cathedral is as fascinating, as you absorb the amazing architecture and significance of the building in relation to the city's history. As you'd expect Notre Dame draws large visitor numbers so a fair bit of patience and tolerance is required, with many tourists interested only in themselves and totally ignoring the directions to remain quiet, remove hats and refrain from flash photography. I am not a religious person, but I did respect people's right to pray in a particular area of the church. Unfortunately far too many tourists just ignored that and barged on through to take photos regardless. You would be missing out if you didn't include a visit to Notre Dame when you are in Paris."

I walked around the entire building and got nice photos, but nothing as full-on revealing of the buttresses as I managed to get from being on the river. My only complaint with this site, as with other churches in Paris was why they don't dust the statues. There was literally six inches of dust on some of the most amazing status in this building, which seems like the Swiffer marketing team needs to step in. The stained glass in this building is something I always wanted to see in person and it did not disappoint. It's a must-see and don't miss the Quasi Modo caf\u00e9 down the street, where the staff is young, friendly, and fun and the crepes are budget-friendly and delicious."

There's no express entry with the museum pass here so you want to make sure you get on the line right away. I'd recommend waiting on line before viewing the inside of the cathedral. (If you don't have the museum pass I believe it's about 12\u20ac to go up). You'll wait on line outside the fence, then inside the fence, then go up some of the stairs where you show your pass or buy a ticket, and can browse some souvenirs. They'll then let you up. They let up groups of 20 people every 10 minutes so this whole process takes about 40 minutes. Once you're up there the views are amazing. You will also see the famous gargoyles! There are two portions of the tower (you can go up even higher once you're up). Definitely worth the wait."

The inside is very nice, although the stained glass is not as impressive as many of cathedrals I've been in, and contributes to a rather dark atmosphere.

And bring a camera."

It is a beautiful cathedral with an amazing history. There was a security check, of course, but no fee to go inside. Mass was in progress so that was special. You can sit and participate if you'd like. The line to enter the cathedral was very long but moved very quickly so don't be discouraged. Restrooms are outside to the right facing the entry (downstairs) and cost .80\u20ac. "

The tour groups dominate these major places starting between 10-11am so get out of bed and hit a big place right off the bat then fill in the rest of the day with the still amazing but lesser known sites. Then do the same thing the next day. Notre Dame was incredible, but also dark. If you have been in many big Buddhist temples, this is what that felt like only European. The architecture and art is incredible. I would say the best part was climbing the towers and seeing the upper parts of outside of the building up closer. Also it gives stunning views of Paris much like the Eiffel Tower or the Arc de Triumph."

We visited during Sunday morning mass that begins at 11:00 every Sunday so we had to walk around the pews and altar in near silence because there are workers that will tell people to keep their voices down if they are talking too loudly. This place is enormous and it took about half an hour to walk all the way around the building. We did stop at the candles because Faridas' sister is a practicing Catholic so she wanted to light a candle. We also stopped in one of the enclaves to the right of the hall corridor where everybody is passing because we saw a little boy kneeling in prayer. This enclave had a very beautiful depiction of crucified Jesus looking down on the pews and kneeling platforms. The ceiling does not have elaborate murals painted on them as can be seen in very many churches and cathedrals throughout Latin America but we would not be able to see them very well anyway because The ceilings of Notre Dame are real, soaring structures; really high. To see everything,one really does have to drop out of the line of visitors and sit in various places. We sat in two places and spent about five minutes at the candle station so we were able to take in quite a lot. This place is a must see in Paris and it is free to enter. It does cost money to take the stairwell to the higher levels where the gargoyles are and we did not go up there because the line was very long and we had taken so many steps up Arc de Triumph, throughout the Paris metro, and to reach the Basilica Sant Coere."

They only let up about 20 people at a time and the line gets very long after opening. But the experience if worth the wait."

The near silence was ruined a little by a very loud PA system reminding everyone to be silent!The large airy building is very impressive and an audio guide is available for \u20ac5 each, which is worthwhile. It is a pen, which you place on the number on a printed plan of the church and starts the guide. The security situation at the moment means bags are checked on the way in, which slows entry a little.

The rose windows are especially impressive.But my personal favorite is still Reim\u2019s Cathedral \u2013 Comparatively, Notre-dame Paris is much smaller and its exterior less elaborately embellished. It\u2019s also more commercial \u2013 It charges you for a leaflet, an audio tour or for seeing its treasures. There\u2019re also visible reminders to encourage donations at multiple places.This said, if you only have time for Paris, Notre Dame is still where you should go. Some tips for your visit:\u2022 There\u2019re 2 queues. You go into the cathedral via the front entrance. It\u2019s free. The queue is due to the bottleneck of security check and it moves fairly quickly. The queue on the other side (facing a caf\u00e9) is for going up the tower. It costs 10 Euro and they allow only a small group to enter at a time. I waited for ~45 min for my turn. And, be prepared to climb \u2013 have to go up about 5 floors just to reach the ticketing office. Then, it\u2019s about another 5 floors up to see the towers. All the staircases are narrow spirals, which allow only one person to go in one direction at a time. So do wear comfortable shoes.\u2022 Also plan some time to stroll around the cathedral from the outside. There\u2019s a small garden at the back and part of the promenade is along the river bank. You can walk to the quay to get a closer look at the Seine. Along the way, there're some good angles to take picture of the exterior of the church.\u2022 There\u2019s a paid toilet at the garden. Or, if you get to the Palais de Justice (~5 min\u2019s walk), you can use the toilets there for free. I quite enjoyed seeing the important-looking lawyers all dressed up and walking up & down the place. So, a nice stop-by"

Another must-see in Paris, but be sure to go early in the day as there is always a long line that develops. Beautiful gardens on the east side. Although not the highest point in the city, there is also ability to go to the upper part of the church for a nice view."

It's a beautiful building, with so many intricate details that can take hours and hours to truly appreciate the labor and workmanship that went into building this magnificent cathedral.The only thing that I wished it didn't have was the endless ways the church is asking visitors to contribute financially either through donation or purchasing products or tour guides. It kind of diminishes the spirituality of the cathedral and commercializes its purpose."

My favourite place in Paris...This building has everything...the history, the stunning architecture and designs of the statues, the towers, doors and the inside is beautiful too...Very popular area with tourists Also rife with beggars/pickpockets so be careful with your things as we had quite a few beggars come up to look for money and also children looking for signatures (distractions whilst they pickpocket...)Apart from that it was a lovely place to be day and nightOur last day, I took my nephew in with me to view the inside. We had to queue outside and wait approx 5 mins (it's a very popular attraction so if you want to go in...get there early when it's quieter)Went through security who checked handbags etc and went in to look around...if you wish to go in and pray you can do so but 99% of people going in are there to look around...You can go upstairs to the top but I'm not a fan of heights so passed on that...instead had a look aroundIt is a beautiful building inside and outHighly recommend visiting the Notre Dame - it's free (which is compared to some other places around Paris and donations are welcome) 5 stars (only downside as before is the long queues and the beggars/pickpockets hanging around)Metro stations nearby, boat stops nearby, bus tour stops nearby (hop on hop off buses) so is easy to get there and around Paris if need be..."

The hordes of tourists rather detract from the atmosphere especially when none of them seem to have actually seen anything of the building except through their phone screens. There are signs everywhere asking for silence and to be fair people were generally being quiet. The cathedral is free to get into but there are little extras you can pay for - an audio guide is probably worth while but you have to leave your ID and I didn't have my passport with me. However for 2 euro you can buy a little booklet (nine languages available). I would recommend some sort of guide as it makes more sense that way. The treasury is another 5 euro which I didn't really think was worth it. The soaring magnificence of the nave is typical of Gothic cathedrals and the rose windows are really worth paying attention to - probably the most magnificent I've seen anywhere. There is a sizeable display going through the history and stages of building which sets the cathedral in context. I would have liked to go up the towers but didn't join the lengthy queue - they take 25 people every 10 minutes. Bear that in mind as a guide."

Once you come out of the Latin Quarter and look over the river you can't miss it.You can go inside the building, it has a huge impressive ceiling and you can walk around and admire the architecture. Be quiet in there though as there are people in there who are praying or just enjoy the peace and quiet.The outside of the building is a hub of activity, with thousands of people coming and going all the time, lots of picture opportunities, lots of birds to feed, and people performing all sorts of shows like dancing with fire and what not.This building is ultimately impressive at night, so make sure you see it when the sun goes down, even thought to midnight there are still people everywhere just hanging out.You can get tickets to go up to the first level (just where the bottom of the towers are) and tickets to get right to the top. Be aware though, there is very little room up there and there are a lot of people there, so if you hate crowds you shouldn't go up. if you do go up and want to come back down just walk straight past the queue at the exit, because the queue is for people wanting to go to the very top, not for people waiting to leave, since the doorway to both is the same it's hard to tell who is doing what, and I stood in the queue for 20 minutes before realising what was going on.You should also walk around the side of the building and view it from the back, very impressive."

See it lit up at night. Walk along the Seine towards it. Walk around it and see how it is constructed with long construction arches reaching up in the rear. Read French literature.Most towns are marketed by a few monuments and places; in Paris it is the Eiffel Tower (a relatively modern construction) and the rather boring, though probably once impressive \"main street\" les Champs Elys\u00e9es. Skip them both. See the glorious Notre Dame."

They have adopted some new age style of audio guide which may seem more clever at first, but is really counter productive.With most audio guides, you select a number, press play and listen. Very simple. With the Notre Dame audio guides, you must carry around a map with you and point the audio guide at a number on the paper before it will work. Technology should make things easier, not make things more complex and give you more items to carry around. The Notre Dame is an impressive structure and it was interesting to see an exhibit of its evolution over time, however it does not stand up to other cathedrals in my opinion, no where near as impressive as St Peters or Westminster"

Thankfully nothing happened and my wife and I were not caught in a firestorm of chaos. Personally I am of the train of thought that bad things can happen anywhere so I won't let that deter me from my review of the cathedral - although I will say there is a lot of parking space around the outside of the Cathedral which does not seem \"safe\" given the circumstances. Nonetheless, my wife and I visited on an overcast / rainy day and the pictures of the outside of the cathedral were ideal. The weather really played into the gothic motif of the building. Gargoyles look a lot more fierce with a little dreariness. I have been inside the cathedral during past visits and certainly recommend doing the climb to the top of the cathedral to ring the bell. Unfortunately, after traveling Europe in the past, I tend to be somewhat underwhelmed by churches - they get a little exhaustive after awhile. Once it was pagan, then protestant, now gothic......and on and on. Anyway, if churches are your thing, this is a must see! But I don't recommend standing way out by the vehicles to take pictures - probably safer closer to the building."

Although in French, I am a Catholic and could follow along easily and took communion, which was special to me.

Not crowded at all and a little more up close and personal.

We arrived early on a Sunday morning before it became crowded and were able to get beautiful photographs! We also attended the Sunday morning service. The mass was all in French and was a very spiritual, memorable experience. The only distraction was that other tourists were touring the cathedral and were talking and snapping pictures during the mass! The inside of Notre Dame is very ornate, with interesting artwork and other valuables. The side alters resembled exhibits. The stained glass windows are very lovely. We enjoyed our time at Notre Dame Cathedral and would highly recommend it to others."

From the intricate sculptures and ornate carvings to the spooky gargoyles, Notre Dame has it all.My biggest recommendation is to arrive for when it opens otherwise the queues to get in will stretch the whole length of the courtyard (I'll refer to it as a courtyard but it's much grander than this word indicates) and you will wait for ages to go in. I can confirm though that if you have no other opportunity to visit Notre Dame (and queuing is your only option) it is worth it to see inside. Briefly returning to the courtyard itself, just as you enter it there's a small staircase leading down to a crypt, there is a charge to go in (unfortunately I can't remember how much as we didn't go this time but I think its \u20ac5-\u20ac6). From what I remember it was quite good and worth doing but at the time we felt that we'd done it once and wouldn't need to again. As previously mentioned we didn't go to the crypt this time instead, we headed straight to the Tower. Again, I cannot recommend highly enough that you arrive as soon as it opens. We got there 30 minutes beforehand and we were already 20th in the queue but it did still enable us to be the first group up. It was about \u20ac12 for the ticket which you buy just as you get to the top of the first staircase. There's also a small gift shop at this level (as well as there being another one in Notre Dame Cathedral itself). I will warn you now, there's 422 steps the majority of which is via steep spiral staircases and once you've committed yourself to the climb there's no turning back as it's a dedicated staircase for people going up only! That being said, the views you get from the small windows during your ascent give you a 'teaser' of what is yet to come and once you do make it to the first viewing platform, you instantly realise it was so worthwhile!The views across Paris are breath-taking and being able to see the sculpted gargoyles close up is a real treat as their expressions and mannerisms are fantastic and can only really be appreciated from this angle.Once you've had the opportunity to fully take in the scenery and also see the famous bells of Notre Dame (and take as many photos as possible) you then ascend again but this time to the very top.From here you can get a fantastic panoramic view but you have a time limit of 5 minutes and there is a guard there to monitor this. It's good that they do this though as it enables everyone to get a great view and besides there is only one short staircase so the one you go up is the same one you come down so they have to stagger the visitors reaching the top so as to avoid chaos! Once you have done this though it's then straight down and its a dedicated staircase for people going down only.It's free to go into Notre Dame Cathedral itself and the beauty and splendour inside is staggering, after doing the Tower we decided that as the queue wasn\u2019t too bad we would go in. The statues, d\u00e9cor and outstanding stained glass windows are breath-taking and if you are lucky enough to arrive when there's a service going on and the choir is singing (or even if they are rehearsing) the acoustics are unbelievable. Upon entering there is a vending machine that dispenses fantastic miniature guide books for \u20ac2, I highly recommend getting one as it's a great souvenir as well as being very useful!I cannot recommend Notre Dame highly enough. It holds so much of a presence and it's architecture and history are known and appreciated by people of all ages."

It's easy and convenient to use, you need to leave some form of ID or card with them to collect back later keep in mind. The problem with the audio guide is, if you no nothing about Christianity or churches, you won't understand much. There is a paid section inside to see the treasury of the church, 5-6\u20ac but I skipped it. Instead head outside and get in the line for the two towers. On average the wait would be some 30-45 minutes as they can only let in a few people at a time. But it's well worth it. The entry is 10\u20ac and there are some 380 steps to climb. One can go up a flight further to see the huge bell towers. It would be around 2 hours to cover the church and the tower."

The cathedral took several hundred years to build and located on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 in the fourth arrondissement of Paris, France. The cathedral is very much considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture, and is among the largest and most well-known church buildings in the world. Entering the cathedral one sees the statues of the apostles and Christ and the feeling is amazing. The structure is fully built of free standing stone with flying buttresses to hold the walls up and displace the heavy weight of the roof. For water drainage, there are various gargoyles that spew rainwater from their mouths during a rainstorm, which would create a magnificent effect.The wait line to get into the cathedral (if you have advance tickets) is not too lengthy, but beware of the pickpockets! We were warned of teams of 3-4 teenage girls what would approach tourists asking if we spoke English, where one of them would hold a clipboard with a questionaire whilst an accomplice would pick your pocket. We saw a team of them but they never approached us, thanks to our tour guide and her warnings. Inside the building is an active cathedral, with all of the gothic features found in medieval churches, only on a much grander scale. Many burial crypts and honoraria to past saints adorn the periphery, and the sanctuary, organ and layout are nothing short of magnificent. The craftsmanship and artistry that adorn this cathedral that took so long to construct are amazing. There is also an area inside that details the history of the building of the cathedral, and a gift shop (?interesting?). A must see when visiting Paris!"

It was so interesting to learn about the building and how it changed over time. I believe it is free to get in.. was had the Paris museum pass so I can't remember the places that charged. The archeological crypt is nearby and you should definitely visit. The tour to go to the top of the cathedral is on the left side when you are facing the front. This was the only thing we had to wait for and the museum pass does not get you priority entrance. We waited about an hour. It was worth it. It was nice to get to go to the top and get close to the gargoyles and the 2 bells. Definitely walk around the right side and the back of the cathedral as you get a really good look at the building architecture and there is a nice garden area. If you have kids there is a playground area in the back and on the side."

On the plus side the architecture is superb, a work in progress for almost 900 years. A small display catalogs progress over the centuries. Side tours of the tower and the treasury are worth the cost; the line to climb the tower looks really long. The rose windows are about the best we've seen in the world and the architectural details, inside and out, have to number in the thousands. We were not able to hear the organ or a choir, but they would have to be magnificent in this setting. On the down side are the incredibly long lines and hundreds, no maybe a couple of thousand tourists present inside and out. We went on a Friday afternoon and it was packed including a full cadre of Roma types, military guards, and beggars. However, this is part of the overall charm and experience one has in Paris. Others have said, go early in the morning and minimize the crowds. I can believe it. Along with the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower and several museums, this is a must see. Cheers!"

Once the Cathedral opened, the queue moved quite quickly as they let people in in large groups.With my passport i was able to show that i'm an EU member between 18-25, and go up free of charge.It was quite a climb to the top, thankfully they keep a one way system, so you don't collide with other tourists coming back down.Although it was quite crowded and the top, the views were spectacular.

Even if one is not keen on Gothic Catholic churches, the history and significance of this cathedral makes it well worth the visit. The beautifully decorated portals outside, the stained glass and organ inside, the sheer number of chapels with paintings and statues... If only seen as a work of art, the Notre Dame is an important landmark for every tourist in Paris."

However, at the famous Notre Dame Cathedral, be prepared for the heaviest security we experienced on our trip. The island in the Seine on which Notre Dame stands is a very busy place. And the crowds that come to see the cathedral are large. When we were there the cathedral was holding a special Vespers service for the Virgin Mary - a French Holiday. We were allowed into the side areas of the cathedral and were able to see and hear the service in progress. This means we heard the cantors, the congregation singing, the massive organ, and the professional choir. What a treat to both see the beauty and massive magnificence of this building and hear the sounds of music. Both inside and out the cathedral is the most impressive gothic structure you will ever see. You wonder why the island didn't sink into the river when it was built. This is why this is one of the two top attractions tourists visit when in Paris. Just be prepared for crowds and multiple levels of security before you are allowed to enter."

The darkness the the candle lights forms a wonderful atmosphere together with the paintings and the monuments. When you are Notre Dame you do feel all the emotions accumulated there through the history. There is a line at the entrance because of the security check but it moves fast. One hour is enough to see the inside roughly. You can spend all day if you want to the emotional state to continue ans drive you.On the outside garden is great and easing."

My favorite for beauty inside is St Paul in London, and for overall appeal is St Michael in the Wild, also in London.Notre Dam is worth a look see however if only for its history and the flying buttresses."

It is FREE. And everyone has to wait in line for the security check and to get in. There is a line (and a ticket) to climb to the top. I didn't do that so I can't comment. My recollection is that it wasn't very expensive.Second, don't pay for a guided tour. Everyone has to be very quiet and this puts a damper on your ability to listen to a guide let alone ask follow up questions. At regular intervals, they blare: \"SILENCE!\" in about a dozen different languages as a reminder that people are there to worship. Upload an audioguide on your phone and walk around on your own.For these reasons,"

But the seated people were eventually asked to stand up to form the line toward the relique. Everyone on the line kissed the holy ring. So did I. The relique prayer card was sold for 2\u20ac for these lined up people. What I liked most was these people had no discrimination from their ethnicity. Just the French ability would be a matter but that was all. The prayer cards had several language choices such as French, Spanish, English, and so on. If you are a Catholic and speak French, these big French cathedrals are worth a visit during the big mass and cerebration time. The nearest metro station is Cita and not far from it.

There are various side chapels around the side of the cathedral, several enormous stained glass windows and of course the bells. There is a separate tour of the crypt I didn't take but would be of interest to history buffs. There are queues but they move very fast. Worth a visit just for the carved montages of the life of Christ around the outside of the main altar."

Should be a welcome spiritual experience but not when the crowds of tourists ignore the requests to stay out of the areas intended for prayer, worship, and praise, and forever take flash photos of things they have no intention of understanding. Is it a place of worship, or a tourist attraction? The tourist visit code / etiquette undermines the principle purpose of the building, is far from respectful of the faith it represents, and loses the opportunity to present an awe inspiring, or even meaningful understanding of a formative basis of Western society. Perhaps it does represent our evolving society, selfie obsessed, loud, brash. \"Help me to feed my children\" the beggars plead to the queues outside who have neither eyes, nor ears to help. \"For the blind shall not see, and the deaf shall not hear\", but they can queue up to take photos to share on social media telling their friends \"I'm having more fun than you are!\".Free to go in but expect to queue for the security checks. Just imagine for a moment the guards represent St Peter, at the pearly gates of heaven, and they are asking to peer into your hearts rather than your bags..... what might they find?"

The view is outstanding, and you can see two of the 4 bells in one of the 2 towers since they always close one off to use for ringing the bells and the other for tourists to take photos. The architecture is magnificent and inside on the main floor is HUGE! The stained glass is something to view in awe. A must see! It is free to go inside the Cathedral, and a nominal fee to go up to the top. That is why I checked off \"not sure\" below for \"Is it free?\""

The stained glass windows are mesmerising and the gothic architecture is suitably awe inspiring.

We went early in the morning on a Tuesday and waited less than 1 min for security though when we left the line was all the way across the plaza. It's free to enter, most of the painting descriptions are in French though there is a detailed history of how the cathedral was built in English. My only complaint is they ask that you don't talk and the other people there couldn't respect that. They have active mass going on and they are kind enough to let tourist see the beauty so I would hope more people could show them that respect. But a must see."

Taking photos with gargoyles was fun, looking at the bell was fun also. Everything was fun! Worth the money and exercise. Note: go early, enter the cathedral (opens at 8.30am), then line up for the tower at 9am+ (opens by 10am). If you come at 10am, the line will be long and it moves pretty slowly, going up by batches.My sis and I came late the first day, we gave up and left, and came back another day early to beat the crowd. It's a rather affordable way to see Paris!"

Enormous naves with lots of marvelous sculptures and paintings, and of course the very famous stained glasse \"roses\" makes this Cathedral one of the most visited and recognized churches of the world. The outside is also a very particular one, with the innovative flying buttresses, the very well known gargoyles and chimeras the beautiful relaxing garden at the back and the tower which you can climb up (almost 400 steep stairs) to get fantastic views of Paris.

There are sections around the outer circle of the cathedral, each dedicated to a different saint, person or monastic order etc. It makes for a very interesting visit and you get to 'choose your saint' if you wish to light a candle for someone you would like to remember while there.....suggested donation of 2 Euro's per candle. You can also take a while to pray or take in the stunning surroundings in the middle of the cathedral if you also want to. The building only takes you 30-45 minutes to walk round, but there's just enough time to make sure you to rub St Peter's foot and guarantee your entrance through the pearly gates also!!"

The architecture was detailed and inside, the church was dark and atmospheric. The church was in service and so our experience was backed with hymns resonating between lofty columns. Candles were lit and the sunlight framed the stained glass windows. As it were late evening, we were not able to stay long and were ushered out after only about 15 minutes. As we were not on a guided tour, we did not get to go up into the tower, which was the only disappointment to the day. They also want visitors to remain silent as there are always church services, which I respected but I had been looking forward to singing a few songs from The Hunchback of Notre Dame! OUT THERE! I highly recommend a visit to Notre Dame. Book a guided tour of the towers and get there early to avoid any disappointment."

It was a lovely day and we enjoyed the sights!"

A bit of peace in the hullabaloo of the City.) However, I digress, Notre Dame was a first sight overpowering both for the magnificence of both it's position and of course it's place in French and European history. Plus , that fact it was free to go in!! One for you Frenchies !! The line waiting to go in was long ,but courteous , something not often experienced on the continent, however the line made up of all sorts, not only christians, but just about every other religion judging by the garbs being worn. The line moved fairly quickly and after entering free movement was allowed, apart from sections engaged in prays. I even found myself lighting candles (much to my wife's amusement ) and swimming in a sea of history. Take your time, absorb as much as you can, then go looking for a nice estaminie for lunch and a few reflective\" ver du vins\". If in Paris do NOT miss visiting!!"

If you want to go up to the tower(s) there is a separate entrance on the left side of the cathedral where you have to queue. Times will vary but it took us 45 minutes to gain entry in late August at 11am so that should give you an idea. Entry is free for under 18s and adults are 10 euros, so very well priced. Please note that there are over 300 steps inside and the stairwells narrow as you get higher, so not one for people with mobility problems and/or claustrophobia!

Both are an amazing place to visit for a number of reasons. Primarily is the incredibly beautiful cathedral, to be admired by everyone, it is also free to access the cathedral. However if you are wanting to ascend to a higher level, then you exit the cathedral and head to the side entrance, this does cost you but the panoramic views of Paris are only topped by the eiffel tower in my opinion.Once again getting tickets online are beneficial but the wait is about 40 minutes depending on the time of day etc. Now they warn you as you pay but this has over 400 stairs to the top, so be warned as they have no elevators. You do this in sections at different times but it is a bit of climb. Access to the viewing balconies are limited which is both good and bad as you have a good amount of space to take photos but it also stalls the experience as you cannot go to the next area until the other group clears out. When you make it the very top the views are absolutely stunning and offer a full 360 degrees. If you are an avid photographer then plan your visits around the positioning of the sun so to avoid dissapointment. After an amazing view from the top you have the stairs to tackle back on your way down."

You can donate to the church once inside or pay to take the stairs up to the top of the church for a view of the city. But if you are travelling on a budget, this is one of the sights that should be on your list to go to. You can donate a few coins, light a candle and be be prayed for, you can go to confession or even just sit reflectively in the pews of this sacred church.I absolutely loved that they allowed photography (without flash) inside as well.

Bishop of Paris, decided to build a new cathedral for the expanding population. Although construction started in 1163, it was not completed until roughly 180 years later in about 1345. Built in an age of illiteracy, the cathedral retells the stories of the Bible in its portals, paintings, and stained glass.It was also here that Napol\u00e9on, wishing to emphasize the primacy of the state over the church, crowned himself emperor."

For those who go for a purely religious experience they also do Church services on a regular basis. The church is free but to go the top there is fee and a separate cue.

This architectural beauty cannot be described in words and is more grand than you can imagine. The day we went, the line to enter was so long it was reached the other side of the courtyard however it moved VERY quickly, so please don't let the long line deter you from entering. We went on the tour to the top and DEFINITELY recommend it. The view from the top is so beautiful and allows you to appreciate the sculptures on the exterior of the building as well. My only warning: if you have any problems whatsoever with stairs, this tour is NOT for you. The number of stairs that you need to climb to get to the top is shocking and there is no elevator (that I'm aware of). But the climb is worth it!"

Soaring Gothic ceilings, massive carvings, gorgeous windows, amazing external buttresses and gargoyles. Each alcove is set up as a different place to meditate or worship. If you are not so inclined, just admire the art and statuary. The admission is free and the line moves quickly to get in. Be ready to have any bags inspected. The guards take a quick look inside. You can rent audio equipment, I believe and there is a souvenir shop on the way out. Do yourself a favor and study up before you go so you can appreciate the marvels of building such a grand place so very long ago.To help out the cathedral, you can drop in a few euros and light a candle for a loved one."

We didn't book many tours on our visit to Paris as we wanted to explore freely on our own, but this was one we booked because we didn't want to miss it. I recommend an after hours tour to climb the bell tower (we booked with Viator). I was a bit nervous after reading reviews, because I can get claustrophobic, but I was glad I overcame my fear and did this. The fact that we went on a cool evening so it wasn't stuffy, and there are small openings frequently all the way up the tower helped to ease the climb. It's 422 stairs through a spiral staircase that gets even more narrow near the top. Bring water because it's dusty, and going after hours (6:30) helped because it wasn't as crowded. This climb was so worth it to hang out with the gargoyles and chimera and to see the bells close up. The views of the city from up there are wonderful! The tour was informative as well as getting us the access after hours. Be sure to arrive early to visit the inside of the gorgeous cathedral before closing."

Be aware that the cafes surrounding the cathedral will price gauge you for everything fromCoffee to toilets. It's best to step outside the perimeter to have a coffee or lunch.

Also, it's not really a tour; you can go up, ask questions and go down, but it's not guided per se. Also, the wait gets long quickly; it starts at 10 am, we arrived at 10:15, but didn't get in until close to 11:30. You can show up at 9 to make sure you're first in line, but then you still wait an hour to get in. Either way, it was worth the wait and cost of admission!"

But if you're put off by the steps, start practicing before you go and know that this slightly overweight 52-year-old made it. And if you have any hesitation about the cost of going after hours, all I can say is there are no lines, no rush, and you and 20 or so other people and a guide get the place to yourself. It was worth every single penny! Oh those views! Of all the amazing things we did in Paris, I'd put that hour and a half at the very top of the list. Just don't forget your camera!"

Note the tri-lingual display panels that show the successive stages of building over many years, and ponder the history it represents. Be sure to walk around the outside to fully appreciate the cathedral's delicate beauty, and the exquisitely buttressed east end. And spend some time in the plaza out front, too: one can encounter people from all over the world, not to mention the pigeon man (or pigeon lady, depending on the time of day...)."

The plaza in front is great for taking photographs, and tour buses and especially, the tour boat, drops you off right in front of the cathedral. When you step inside, you are filled with the history of the place, the people who have walked the same steps as you and worshipped in the cathedral. It is a must see stop in Paris, and it is free. Try to come back for a worship service. There was a service with song that I wanted to experience, but it didn't work out with our schedule."

I had booked a hotel close by, as I knew I would want to go look at it many times in many lights. If you have a choice, try to choose a sunny day when you go inside. Even though there are many windows, it can be dark on a cloudy day. Note that there is almost always a line to get in, but it\u2019s a security line only and moves pretty fast. Due to the line I went inside only twice. The last evening being the highlight, as we found that there was a special mass being held, with 2 bishops and representatives of other religions, to pray for peace and an end to violence after the attacks in Rouen that occurred a few days before I was there. To attend mass at Notre Dame is an experience I will always remember. Make sure you go around the back. The view from the small park there is even more interesting than the fa\u00e7ade. You get the best view of the flying buttresses. The back is also less restored than the facade: you see more weathering on the carving. Tip: there is a small public toilet facility back there."

It wasnt until when i have walked out of the church down the street to realize i have lost my newly acquired sunglasses which cost a small fortune. I went into full on panic mode and didn't know what to do. I closed my eyes and my inner voice told me to go back to the church. I went back to the spot where i was taking photos but the sunnies werent there. Disappointed as i was. I decided to leave from the other entrance. As i approached the front chairs close to the alter i saw something silverish glittering in the dark. I turned around and my sunnies were folded and sitting on a chair in the middle of the row.

Imagine starting work on a cathedral in the 1100s, knowing that your great (or great-great) grandchildren would be the first generation to worship within it. Such faith. Personally, I think the exterior with the gothic flying buttresses is the most interesting part, but it is well worth stepping inside to see the interior as well.My one regret from our trip to Paris was that we did not climb the tower to see the gargoyles up close. By the time we arrived (when it opened, around 10am) the line to climb the tower was already down the entire length of the church and did not appear to move for the hour or so that we were in the area."

Another morning we walked around the river side of the cathedral--before most people were even awake. Love those flying buttresses! The tower had an admission charge, and lines were hours long every time we were near, so we missed that. But don't miss the beauty and peace of a quick stop at least in the cathedral.

We stopped here and at first were a little worried that the line was so long it would take a while to get in when actually the line moves really really quickly. The line is long just for security reasons. The building is immaculate. Amazingly intricate architecture and design. You have to be quiet inside - so if you have young kids that tend to speak loudly or a screaming baby, try not to go inside. They have displays about the history of the cathedral and the different phases of construction. There's a very impressive scale model of the place too. It is a very dark and gothic feel cathedral - quite different from a lot of other places you will see in Paris. It's definitely worth the visit. It's located on the original island where the city of Paris started! Might have been better to do an audio tour or guided tour to know more of the history, but even as mere \"lay people\", I was really impressed and enjoyed the visit."

And you probably want to climb the towers as well (a separate entrance to the side of the church). There is a long line to enter the church (free) but it moves relatively fast. It is very common to have services inside. It is really great to be in such an iconic place but I should say that the interior and exterior is like just any other gothic church. Still, you can say this is the original. A must for first time visitors."

The chandeliers give off the romantic feel. What ruins the experience for me are the tourists (mainly my peeps from the mainland) who leave their flash on when taking pics. There is an announcement to be quiet in many languages yet tourists talk way too loud in church. Or when you have a sign that says no taking pictures in a certain section because people are praying and you have tourists who don't bother to look at the sign. The gothic gargoyles really make me think of the hutch back of notre dame."

Every surface seems enhanced with amazing sculptures and gargoyles, and we were mesmerized just taking in the details of the exterior artworks. Inside is breathtaking... the sweeping arch of the vaulted ceiling, the many side chapels each with their own statues and themes, the elaborate and huge stained glass windows. Well worth the wait, and steps away from several sidewalk cafes and other attractions, all in the most historic section of Paris. Don't miss it!"

We were admitted through a side gate and got to go through the bowels of the Cathedral where the Choir could prepare for their performance. Even that was amazing, with all the beauty that comes with a Cathedral and it's history.You walk in an anti clockwise direction around the Cathedral and if you'd like to get some good photos - go early. By lunchtime there is a long, long queue to get in, although it does move quickly. There are some excellent interpretation boards in a number of languages to help guide you on what you are seeing.Notre Dame is central to many places in Paris and is well worth a visit if you like Gothic architecture.Note: admission is free. If you want to climb the bell towers expect to pay a fee. Expect a security bag check. When we were there, lots of Malitia and Police due to recent attacks in France. Be careful.

That suggests it is better to go earlier in the morning.But because of the queues, we decided to not go in, nor go up the tower. Note that there is an entry fee.We were very content to explore the outside. The classic frontage is every bit impressive as you would expect, but with the added advantage of being able to spend time looking at the detail. The side view just adds to appreciating the size of the building. A work of art.The setting on the Isle, surrounded by the Seine is special, more so on the sunny day we visited. The large plaza at the front throngs with so many people and nationalities.The Big Bus stops at the Cathedral, and there is an underground station for the Isle, not far away. Neither is it far from both the Louvre or the Musee D'Orsay. The walk along the river bank is beautiful."

It's built in gothic style and has many gargoyles to help drain the water. Apparently only the gargoyles that have an opening in their mouth are truly gargoyles because gargoyle, the name, come from a French word that pretty much means to gargle, representing the sound the rain makes pouring out. The stained glass decorating the cathedral looks black from the outside but is a beautiful rainbow when you look at it from inside the building. There is a large window made of smaller windows out of stained glass which tell a story of a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity and when he was told to start believing in Roman gods and he refused he was lifted safely into heaven with his whole family. This is a story that has since been removed from the church history because of how ridiculous it is but this cathedral still tells it. In front of the church there is a gold metal circle on the floor and it marks the middle of Paris; apparently every city in France has that circle marking the middle of the city. The wait to get into the cathedral is not bad; 10 to 15 minutes and it's worth it. Make sure to check out the back of the cathedral."

Chatelet and Pont Neuf are both on the other side of the River Seine, but you can easily walk across - or Cite which is on the Ile and if choosing that maybe take a look at Sainte Chapelle on the way.But Notre Dame is an imposing sight as you approach it. You can see it's traditional view or walk to the right and view through the trees. Once you'be been inside, go left of main entrance and along the street to a small garden area with fountain for a quiet reflection at the southerly entrance.After getting there it is free to go inside this historic cathedral - but take care as the lines/queues can be long. But there is so much to see - you can pick up a multi-lingual audio guide (for a cost) inside or just wander around self guiding.It is as you would expect, very impressive inside.

There's no easy way to get in there's no Paris pass there's no fast pass There's No Reservations there's just waiting in line. So because of that try to get there as early as you possibly can in the morning. But it is without question worth it. It is one of the quintessential examples of High Gothic architecture that one can see. Make sure not to look at just the front of the church but walk around it and see the entirety of the outside of the church. If you can bear the line weight and climb to the top of the tower and see the gargoylz. Whatever you do go inside and see the astoundingly beautiful stained-glass windows and the rose window. If you're lucky or if you can plan it try to be there at some point during which they're having services so that you can hear the Magnificent organ. if you like churches it is one of the most magnificent ones that you can find in Europe."

Be sure to be there at least 15 minutes ahead of time, as there is a queue for the security check. Once inside, there were plenty of seats. It was very distracting at first that quite a lot of visitors thought nothing of talking away loudly, taking photographs etc. while there was clearly a religious service taking place, but (sad to say?) you get used to it and can tune it out. Some visitors even joined the queue for Communion just to get a good position for a photograph. There was no need for such disrespect, as once Mass was over, there was no difficulty in moving around the Cathedral and seeing it all. There was a little shop selling quite nice religious mementos inside too, the queue was long but not overly so. Outside the Cathedral, around the back, there is a lovely little public park. We enjoyed a lovely picnic here (bought sandwiches at Subway across the river) and listened to a band play while we ate. There are little playground areas in this park too, for younger children."

To visit the towers you do need to pay and queue and while the view is good and the architectural detailing close up is interesting, it is not an absolute must. It is certainly an important building which has a key role in the entire history and identify of Paris as a city. Like all Gothic cathedrals, it is architecturally impressive both internally and externally.

Situated on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, you may run across it on a stroll along the Seine or on your way to/from the Latin Quarter or Le Marais. Living in Paris, I often attend Mass here, which is a beautiful experience in itself, but even for those that just want to gawk at the gothic structure and take in some rich history, it is worth a stop. Expect crowds, but it moves quickly. I have never taken a tour around the top, but have never felt compelled to do so, as there is much to experience from the free entry portion of the church. Around the church are (also free) gardens that are seemingly underrated. Quiet, serene, massive, and contemplative. It is my number one suggestion for people who visit Paris, not just for the stunning design, but also because it's an excellent starting point to explore the remainder of the city.Metro Stops: -St-Michel Notre Dame \u2013 RER B Train Line (blue)-St-Michel Notre Dame \u2013 RER C Train Line (yellow)-Cit\u00e9 \u2013 Line 4 (fuschia) (BUT) if I were you, take the simpler/quicker (brown) line 11 to H\u00f4tel de Ville.

It is easy to see why this is one of the most famous church buildings in the world. The stained glass alone is worth seeing, as well as the pipe organ. Even amidst the numbers of tourists milling about, being inside the Notre Dame gives one a special feeling of admiration for such a brilliant piece of architecture."

Best time to go is not during mass because they close off certain areas during mass. It is worth standing in line to see this majestic church and it's beautiful stained glass windows. The outside is just as amazing as the inside and the back of the church outside gives the best view of the flying buttresses. Read up on the history and the various statues and parts of the church so you will know what to look for when you go. Just an amazing venue you can't miss while in Paris."

My teenage daughters and I booked a tour with Fat Tires (see my review of Fat Tires under Tours) called 'Skip the line Notre Dame Towers and Sainte Chapelle Tours', so glad we did. For Notre Dame there is no ticket required for entry into the chapel as it is an active church, so you don't have to pay but you do have to queue to get in. The line was long but moved quickly so I guess it took us about 15 minutes. During this time our guide Lavanya was able to give us lots of interesting information through our ear-pieces. Once inside we learnt more whilst we explored this beautiful church. We then walked around the church to the back which is equally as beautiful. The entrance to the Towers is lined with people queuing to get in. We completely skipped this line which saved heaps of time. There are about 400 stairs to the top and it is definitely worth it for the view and the experience. Definitely recommend taking a tour and climbing the towers."

We arrived at 9.00am before the mobs were out of bed and virtually had the place to ourselves. To say it is a magnificent place is to under rate it. You can experience the past power of the Church in this magnificient creation and feel a presence within its walls. A half day could easily be spent in this wonderful structure, learning so much from the architecture to the stain glass scenes. Did you know that the reason there are stain glass scenes is because most of the population could not read or write, so by looking at the windows they could learn of the stories of the Bible from the interior of the cathedral as they gazed heavenward to the light. Use your imagination when you go to this site and see what it was like hundreds of years ago and how revered the clergy were and how they dominated the masses of illiterate."

If you understand the language challenge them or call security; they will quickly disappear.

Be sure to take photos of the gargoyles on the way up when you come out onto the first gallery as there aren't any statues on the top of the tower.

The lines in the summer get extremely long especially if you want to see the bell tower. My husband and I lined up at 9:15 and waited over an hour to get in. I'm not sure we would have wanted to wait any longer than that in the sun. However, if you do get into the bell tower, they really allow you to take ample time for photos. Just be sure you're not wearing bulky backpacks. Parts of it are extremely narrow and you'll end up hitting people left and right. Like I said, go early (right before they open) and take in the church before the crazy crowds get there. It's beautiful, quiet, and you can really get a deep appreciation for it without folks getting in the way. Also, right after you see the church, get in line as soon as humanely possible for the bell tower!"

The queue to enter was long but moved very quickly - free of charge- though you can easily make a voluntary \u20ac2 contribution and light a tealight candle as you enter. A must-do if visiting Paris even if you're not religious. The history of the church including information about the building of the various stages is worth the visit alone. You can also pay to climb the front towers - the quere was huge and the pace slow - we opted against it and instead wandered to the back of the building and sat on another beautiful garden and observed the people and the church on a perfect Sunday morning."

It's very different from the other cathedrals, such as Westminster Abbey or even Sacre-Coeur. Each has their own unique character and personality, and Notre Dame is no different with a dark and 'gothic' feel to it. They even hold masses in there, and we managed to go when one was in progression. I really enjoyed sitting there and soaking in the whole experience.

Central nave area is still a place of quiet worship and contemplation (NO cameras) but all other areas are open to photography without flash. Beautiful side galleries of sculpture, colored walls, frescos-freizes of saints and apostles and Christ, a huge modern cross at the back of the altar soars over a classical statue. The displays and explanations were well-done and easy to follow. We didn't climb to the top, but if I were younger & more able-I certainly would do it."

Warning: the 400 stairs to the top is a pretty strenuous hike and you have to keep up with the group. They only let about 15 people go in at a time. Once at the top, you have a limited amount of time to look out over the city, check out the gargoyles, etc. It's one of those things you should do as a younger person.

If you stand in line to climb the tower however.. you'll be there for a good 2 hours in summertime. We thought we'd queue at 10 AM when it opens.. so did a lot of other people. But since we were there anyway, we decided to queue. The reason why it takes so long is because they can only allow 20 ppl at a time. You get in, go up a couple of stairs to enter an area where you buy your ticket and wait till a group leaves. The stairs are narrow and get even narrower the higher you get.. that's why it's a group at a time per level. After the ticket area you climb up some stairs and get to a lookout where you can see the gargoyles and where the big bell is.. that thing rings for quite some time. While you're at that level you have to wait for the group that's on top to come down before you can go up to the highest point. Once you've climbed those final stairs you get to see all of Paris for 5-10 mins. It's worth it though, especially when yoi have the weather in your favor."

It took us almost two hours to get in, they only let like 20 - 30 people at a time every 10 minutes. That said once in and to the top it was amazing. I think it was the best views of Paris we had, mainly due to the gargoyles. You would get this fantastic shot of a gargoyle with Paris spread out behind and below it. We didn't have to wait to climb the towers of any other gothic cathedral in Europe, but this one had the best views, gargoyles, and was worth the wait."

Our guide gave us valuable insight into the famous landmarks of Paris. The view from the bell towers is stunning. Yes it is quite a walk up & the steps are steep but it's not impossible! You get a close look at the famous gargoyles & there are some funny stories for several that were pointed out to us. We got to see what they claim is the \"home\" of Quassimoto - the famous hunchback of Notre Dame where two of the oldest bells still remain (though they are no longer in use). Fascinating explanations as to the intricate carvings at the front of the cathedral. Many biblical scenes & statues of famous biblical Kings. We returned the following day to see the inside of the church. The stain glass rose Windows see every bit as beautiful as you can imagine, as is the gothic architecture. The choir was singing and it felt like just a serene & holy place. Lots of information on the 200 years it took to complete the castle & you can etho the statue of Joan of Arc & the Pieta at the top of the alter. Don't miss this amazing landmark! Well worth waiting in line for!"

The structure was first started in 1163 and completed in 1345.I sincerely appreciate the greatness of the architecture and the historical role this Cathedral played in the heart of the city of Paris, it's true religious value. The facade tells a pictorial story as well. Be sure to visit a gift shop Inside. I purchased medals and small candles with photographs of the Cathedral on the side which I brought back to my elderly relatives. Mass was in French, but they hand out prayer books in 4 languages.

I am not religious in any way but I do admire the dedication and conviction of the craftsmen who build these churches, and 800 yrs ago with crude tools and a horse and cart. Now we today reap the rewards of seeing the spectacular results of superb architecture. Must do visit."

Visiting Paris on our honeymoon we tried to see as many of the famous sights in the city as possible, so of course Notre Dame was on our list.Getting there was a little tricky as there are no Metro stops on the island itself, but it did give us the opportunity to have a nice walk along the Seine.Arriving at the cathedral itself I must admit we were slightly underwhelmed by both its size, the queue to get in and the amount of tat touters in the vicinity.Inside the cathedral itself it was again a decidedly average experience- it was fairly dark so it was fairly hard to see anything, and what was there was rather less impressive than less hyped cathedrals we have visited elsewhere in Europe. It does have some lovely stained glass rose windows which are worth seeing though. One thing that really amused us was the incredibly loud announcement telling people to be quiet in around 8 different languages - it really did sound like the voice of God was angry with the visitors!Overall it is still a must see sight in Paris but not one that we will be hurrying back to any time soon."

Such a sense of community; even though we're all from \"somewhere\" else; it gives one hope!"

Its construction and innovation of medieval architecture is taught in American public schools. On my first trip to Paris we arrived too late and the church was closed, so it was a 2 year wait before getting to see the inside last August!The square out front is a wonderful gathering place, and its location on Ile de la Cite offers gorgeous views of the Seine. Take a walk around the complex to see the grounds and lush gardens behind the building.Inside the church lies the typical beauty and show of wealth from the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages. There are many seats available for quiet reflection and prayer in the sanctuary and the altar is very beautiful. Several small chapels can be found along the sides of the church. On the left side visitors can find a big expose detailing how the cathedral was built and revamped over the centuries along with a small scale replica of the actual cathedral. Lovers of architecture will especially be pleased touring the site."

I'm overcome with those stained glass windows, the architecture, and all of those intricate and ornate details that make up this cathedral in its entirety. Our rented apartment was only about a 7 minute walk from the Notre Dame...we could actually see the towers from the kitchen window. We made two lengthy visits to the cathedral (lengthy meaning 1-2 hours both times). The first time we walked around the inside several times just taking in structure itself, stopping to light candles in memory of those we've lost, listening to one of the masses taking place, etc. The second time we wandered around back inside and then climbed to the bell tower to take in the views. Again, time well spent if you're able....Note there is not elevator to the bell towers. After our visit to the bell tower, we spent time walking around the outside admiring all the features this part of the cathedral offers. Just a few points....Entrance to the cathedral if free however there is a charge to climb to the bell tower....There is also quite a line that forms for the bell tower so I'd advise arriving to do this first thing in the morning. The line for general entrance moves relatively quickly including a security screening at the door. Once inside, you there is a desk you can purchase audios for a self guides tour. There are also a variety of different sized candles to purchase and light in memory of others. This cathedral speaks for itself!"

But when you first see it's famous arches, it such an imposing building, and makes a lasting impression on you. The closer you get, the more impressive the building becomes, and the massive doors lead you inside, where frequent tours are conducted. I like how it is still a functioning church, so that everyone must be quiet and respectful of their surroundings. Additionally, you see such fantastic sights like the stained glass windows and the organs. Light a candle for a loved one, and take in the sombre surroundings. Also - visit the cathedral at night when it is closed, it makes for fantastic photographs, and it is not as busy (it's closed) so you can go right up and appreciate the architecture. There's also a lovely parl behind it, which is nice for relaxing and getting a good view of the back of Notre Dame. The next time I'm in Paris, I will come here again, and anyone else who is in Paris sould do the same!"

Luckily, entry through the other side didn't take us much time in spite of the queue. I took an audio guide once inside for 5 Euros and it was completely worth the money spent. The cathedral has some beautiful stained glass windows in the pattern of a rose. The hall and the nave are a little different from other cathedral as they are supported with flying buttresses. There is a shallow vessel in the hall near the exit with water filled in it. I saw people touch the water to their forehead. This is the first time I have observed such a vessel inside a cathedral and I would love to know more about its significance."

We were unable to view the Rose window and the high altar because of a movie screen blocking the same. The stained glass windows were underwhelming. And, there was no sense of reverence. In the other churches, there was a clear sense of divine presence. ND was simply a museum."

We took the metro to the Notre Dame station and came up the steps to see this high, lofty cathedral and were just spellbounded to see this huge masterpiece. We read about it in Rick Steve's guide and would you also be awed if you came to know that this building was started in the 1100's by the townpeople, many of whom did free labor to help construct creating the true hunchbacks of Notre Dame. Those people knew they would never in their lifetime be able to pray in the church but knew that one day their descendants will come here.The stained glass windows, the statues, arches, are worth a long see. We stood in the line outside to enter the church after a security check and the line moves pretty quickly. If you would like to climb the tower, then the line is atleast 1 1/2 hour long, I know because I asked this nice lady who was waiting in line and she was still about 50 people or so behind and was already waiting for an hour."

Once inside you get to see the immense scale of the building, you can take photographs, but please remember this is a place of worship, unfortunately whilst we were there people seemed to be forgetting this and going into the centre to take pictures of the centre aisle and alter where people were praying, they cold have done this from behind the barrier area and still got the same picture. You can hire a audio guide, but I just used my guide book as it was quite informative. You can also see how the cathedral as been extended over the years at a display towards to back of the building."

The cathedral is incredible from a historical sense - around 700 years old. It's such a time consuming effort of craftsmanship and skill, and we were blessed to have a visiting choir performing during our visit. The acoustics were wonderful. The flying buttresses are visible from the sides and rear of the cathedral. A good highlight in our day!"

At Notre Dame we were told every little known tidbit, pieces of history and the back stories. He was great!!! We've used City Wonders for many of our European tours on this and prior vacations. We look at City Wonders' tours 1st because of the wonderful people they have leading these groups and the interesting tours they put together."

The flying buttresses and gargoyles are a sight to see on the outside, and the stained glass (particularly the Rose Windows) are stunning inside. Bags are checked here (and elsewhere these days) but admission remains free. Silence is required because this is a house of prayer -- and people really do respect that. For a few euros you may light a candle in several areas inside -- a wonderfully spiritual thing to do for those of us who believe. Admire the art -- and to the left of the altar be sure to look at the timeline of the great cathedral's construction. It's amazing.Masses are still conducted here and my son, who was in Paris November 13, told us that a special remembrance mass was held immediately after that tragedy which was very special indeed.There are some 432 steps to the top of the tower, which allows for a scenic view of Paris. Not for those who have trouble with steps but for those who don't might be a must do.The Little Sisters of the Poor were at the exit accepting donations. One shouldn't just walk by -- my two cents -- these lovely ladies serve the poor and especially the elderly poor. They do not allow anyone to pass from this life alone -- those without means and family are never left alone (I have volunteered in the past with these sisters in our community) -- their quiet request for funds in the church of our lady is especially poignant to me. Notre Dame should be on everyone's bucket list for Paris."

This is a truly beautiful church and it was a very pleasant visit. Entry was free but we left the recommended donations to light two candles. We wanted to go up to the top but the July queue was enormous so we didn't bother."

On a practical note, entrance is free. And be sure to visit the gardens in the back. Also, there are very clean toilets in the gardens. The view from the towers is worth the entrance fee to go up to the towers. And of course, you can imagine Quasimoto from the Hunchback of Notre Dame ringing the bells from right up on top."

So go around 8 am or in the afternoon unless you love huge crowds and lines. Second, if going up in the belfry is on your list of things to do well do so. You are going to stand in line a bit and pay for the privilege but be my guest. Be warned - those bells there are not for decoration, About every 15 minutes they ring for a set duration which depends on the time of day and time of the hour. THEY ARE LOUD. It will not be pleasant.Walk around to the back of the church on the outside and enjoy the view on the Seine as well as of the architecture on the church.When you are done go to Ste Chapelle and La Conciergerie.

I reckon we took about 10 minutes to get in. We were very lucky to have a superb guided tour in English with a volunteer guide. For free! Our guide was an American lady living in Paris, and she was excellent. Her name is Michela, if I remember correctly. The participants were called to meet under the organ balcony at 14:30. The tour was open to anyone. The visit was a highlight of my trip to Paris with my wife and young daughter."

The cathedral architecture and it's decorative windows are beautiful. Also, if you'd like to see the Treasury inside, the pass doesn't cover that and you've to buy separate ticket."

Its not just the Cathedral but the surrounding area that always has something going on.In the front you have street performers ranging from buskers to fire eaters its also a place people just like to come to hang around.It is on an island in the river Seine and there's always people sitting on the banks in little groups just chatting away.From the front of the Cathedral you can walk down the left side to the rear and get some good photos.Also you will come to a bridge (blocked to cars) which cross's over to another island.You will find groups of people sitting on the bridge listening to what ever musicians are playing (this was in the summer) .There are several outdoor cafe's in the area.We tend to end our day in this area because there's always something going on."

The interior is magnificent, as in most cathedrals, and interestingly enough, the people walking around are not annoying. I do not believe in taking photos in places of worship, though the exterior is really quite interesting and deserves good photographs! There are usually crowds both in and out the cathedral, unless it's a rainy day. I was off-season so it wasn't too bad, especially inside. All in all, I recommend visiting it!

Outside it is architecturally stunning, but inside it is unbelievable, it actually takes you by surprise how impressive it is inside, you sort of know it's going to be good, but not this good. The stained windows and the way the light enters the Cathedral give it an almost mystical feel, as if something is about to happen. It is huge inside, there is also an impressive exhibition as you walk around on how the Cathedral has been developed over the centuries and added too on numerous occasions. It is free to get in, but you do have an option to throw a couple of Euros into a couple of collecting points along the way. So glad we decided to go and have a look. Definitely worth a visit, with plenty if tourist gift shops and cafes and bars close by."

But...the line moves fast. If you want to climb the bell tower....that's a different story. They let in very very few at a time and the line is a killer. So...if you have to do the bell tower then go as soon as it opens and be the first one up the tower then leisurely go to the church. And...by the way...the crypt is a must see which is right infant of the church on the same grounds. And....one more thing, definitely walk the gardens in the back. So pretty!"

The size and scope of it, along with the history, is breathtaking. Of course, everyone else visiting Paris is there also. So it is very crowded.

You get gorgeous views of the city, the gargoyles and the bells. I recommend you line up before it opens, which is at 10am. The line is on the left side of the church if you're facing the front. This was the longest line we waited in while in Paris (about an hour and a half), but well worth it. You can't make reservations, so get there early. They only let about 20 people in every 15 minutes, so you may wait a while even though the line may not seem long. Once you get up there, you'll appreciate the small groups that are let in. You can easily move around and take beautiful pictures without worrying about bumping into someone because it's so packed (like the Eiffel Tower). My boys are 6 and 9 and loved being up there. It's very safe, but there are a lot of stairs, so make sure everyone in your party can navigate spiral stairs easily."

New to me on this visit was a model of the church and displays that show how it was built over the ages that are very well designed and interpreted in English. I also paid the 5 euros to see the Treasures of Notre Dame, a small exhibition of religious robes and objects created for Papal visits, as well as other beautiful items made in honor of various saints. The same evening we went back to see and hear the Danish Royal Choir perform a concert there. It was a cash-only event and well-attended. The acoustics were amazing. There's much more to Notre Dame than this, but dark Gothic cathedrals really aren't my thing. I much prefer the Basilica of Sacre-Coeur, especially at Vespers, but unfortunately I didn't get to visit there during this trip."

There was no English here or there as promised by the website. As a Protestant just wanting to attend a service in this amazing church, however, it was still a great. Beautiful singing and organ filling the air. Of all the cathedrals I have visited in Europe, this one seemed the most alive as there were so many worshiping.

One of the details I learned when touring the Notre Dame Cathedral is the length of time that it's construction was on-going [from 1163 thru 1272, and then completed in approx. 1345]. Of course, since then there have been modifications, and restorations. At this point, I can assure you that you would be hard pressed to find any Cathedral that would be even close to the same level of detailed architectural designed, constructed and maintained at such a high level. This is an absolutely beautiful Cathedral, and I would consider it a 'must see' when in Paris, France."

Surprisingly, the line moved very quickly, as it was a security checkpoint and the staff were very efficient. It's mesmerizing inside. The colors and sheer size of this monument are amazing. You make your way around the interior in an orderly, flowing stream and can stop at the little side chapels to pray or take photographs. We were very impressed with this cathedral and were going to attempt to do the roof tour, but that line was huge and again, there was no PMP shortcut. We very much enjoyed this church and would love to visit again - it probably takes 10 times to be able to take in all of the architecture, stained glass, etc."

As you enter the church notice the saints carved on the door way and mostly covering the front of the building. A good travel guide book with enable you to name these saints and know the history of their sacrifices. Speaking of guides, there are free English language tours during the summer, and, you will need to wear your comfortable shoes for the wait in line, but it is really worth the wait. The stained glass tells a marvelous story of faith, as does the magnificent, soaring vaulted ceiling. Don't miss this marvel and make sure you have a knowledgeable guide or you will miss out on the amazing details of this Cathedral. Oh, at the very end of this island there is a Holocast Memorial that is very moving as well. Have a great trip."

It\u2019s quite gloomy and looks simple and lacking ornamentation. Moreover, Notre Dame is overwhelmingly crowded, which takes away from the charm that such a religious building should project. The line ups at the front are annoying, and the waiting line to visit the Tower of the Cathedral is huge. If you really want to marvel the most beautiful cathedrals of France, you should consider visiting the Amiens Cathedral, Bourges Cathedral and Chartres Cathedral, just to name a few, which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites by themselves.

If you time it right, you can complete the inside visit and get outside to queue up for the tower tour before it opens also.2) Get there early! This is CRITICAL for the tower tour. The line gets crazy long really quickly. It is worth getting there and lining up 15-30 minutes before they open to get in among the first group(s). Don't skip this! The tower tour was a fantastic addition to the visit."

Many paris' top attractions are not worth a trip flying from other parts of the world. Unfortunately, they are the things most tourists do in Paris. The city is undeniablly beautiful. However, it doesn't have the historical feeling of Roma and London nor the diversity and bustling of New York. Even its much prouded food is a bit disappointing: besides French food, the offer is limited. paris is the place for long stay. Its romantic and artistic atmospheres are magically hovering over every street, park, square, market, cafe and every corner of the city.

We've really enjoyed visits to St. Patrick's in New York City, St. Paul's in London, St. Peter's, etc. but this was very crowded and not as beautiful. Entrance is free but they charge 5 euros from the reliquary which I thought was a bit of a rip off as it was very small with few items. The lineup started over to the left of the Cathedral (if looking at it from the front) and went in a big loop out front to the door on the right. It didn't take long to get in despite the length of the lineup, perhaps 20 minutes. It is rather confusing looking because there is also a large crowd out front and people were butting in line at random. The entrance to the stairs to climb to the top are along the left side of the Cathedral. There is a charge for this and the line was long each and every time we were there. There is not a separate line for tickets; you buy your ticket and then go up. Although it was confusing and unclear to us if there was a separate entrance for folks with the Paris Museum Pass but there was none. I'd suggest staying outside and taking some great outdoor shots of this historic Cathedral."

You also can attend mass.I took a tour of the cathedral, got there right before it opened and there was no line, only a handful of people.It's just breathtaking, I really don't have words to describe the feelings you feel, well I guess I do, you can tell this was a church built for God; this is a place he has placed his hand on. You feel it when you enter.So very happy I took the time to tour the cathedral, and just a little advice, even if Catholicism isn't not what you practice, be respectful of the ones who do ,who are attending mass, saying prayers try not to push through them to get your picture, your time will come, have patience."

First the bad: If you would like to tour the inside, the bell-tower and the crypt at ND you have to do them all separately. I was unable to find a tour that covered all 3 and it appears that each of them are managed by a different group. I would recommend booking the bell-tower or the crypt in advance online. I did not do this and was sad to discover a huge line for the bell-tower and that the crypt was closed on the day of our visit. Now the good: The main attraction, inside ND, is easy to see. There was a line but I found that it moved quickly. Also, it's free to get in! I recommend paying the 5 euro for the audio-tour, it has an abundance of info, more than I cared to listen to actually. Also, the audio fee includes the Treasury (otherwise 3 euro) which should not be missed because you get to see the most beautiful treasures up close. I found the gift shop to be expensive but I had collected the tokens from the machines (I think 1 euro each) placed around the outer edge of the cathedral and I sprinkled them with holy water from the large fount. These made nice gifts that traveled home easily. Overall it was a great experience, I found my visit to be truly divine. Helpful hint: they hold a picture ID for the audio guide unit, I was glad I had my driver lisc on me rather than hand over my passport. However, it didn't seem to be an issue for anyone that I could tell."

I couldn't find it.-- Hire a guide. We didn't and regretted it.-- There is a park behind the church next to the river. It has a playground for kids, free wifi and plenty of park benches. Grab sandwiches and hang out in the park -- esp if you have little kids. Nice to eat and look up and this great building that most people just pass through."

But, read up on its history before you go - it'll make the visit much more interesting. The queues tend to be long during peak hours, so try to visit it in the morning, when the crowds are smaller.My recommendation is not to take the tower climb; the waiting times are long, and except for a nice view of Paris from a height, there is not much to see. If you want to see Paris from \"above\" go either to Montmartre or take the escalators up to the top of the Centre Pompidou (both are free)."

We had a window view of the line, used their bathroom, and when we saw a few people start the line, we joined them. Glad we did. The line went around the block. About 20 mins or so before they open, about 3 or 4 people come to set up. They take this job seriously. One guy, really I think he was a sweetie at heart, liked to bark orders to the line to 'go back' and this is difficult because the half mile of line behind you isn't sure why everyone is coming their way. But this MUST be done, before anything else is done. They take about 20 people at a time into the tower. We were in the first group. They take you up circular stairs (which you will soon learn to hate) into a gift shop and ticket processing area. Don't make the mistake that I did...I thought the tour would come back through the gift shop and it would save me carrying things. The tour DOES NOT go back through the gift shop, you exit from out of the tower on the other side of the building. When the guide is ready, they take you up more circular stairs, it is not very wide, and just barely will let another person go past you, if you are a bit out of breath - read not in shape.) You go to the first outside level, which is where the famous sad or bored, depending on your interpretation, gargoyle is located. Hint - each level has fencing (I suppose for jumpers or people throwing things) and you have to plan your photos carefully. I found that putting my lens right up to the fencing and centering it over a hole turned out the best. It all depends on your camera and how picky you are in taking pictures. This is a good place to rest up a bit, because, yes, you guessed it, there are more stairs. You go up to another level. Note - it is pretty windy up there. This level is more or less single file, around the loop and then you head back down when the guide tells you. So how it works is when you are on the first level, they bring in another 20 people, so if you are at the end of the long line outside, you have a long wait. Get there early and I am not taking 15 mins. We went at least an hour and 20 mins early to eat and be ready for 'the line'."

The set up is clearly \"so you can say you've been there\". Would not return other than in a skip the lines private tour. Otherwise spend a few minutes on the plaza outside and move on."

You can also pay a small fee to climb the tower and view the gargoyles up close. Our friend elected to go up - expect a long line and a difficult climb.

Queue can be up to four hours for the towers so would advise people to book a skip the queue tour.Queue into Notre Dame itself took us around 10minutes at 11am but was much longer when we were leaving at 13.00. This queue is for a security check so unavoidable. I wouldn't bother with a tour if not going to the towers. Some lovely stained glass windows and interesting architecture. Neither of us are religious, but obviously remained respectful of rules such as no flash photography, noise, etc. Quite a lot of people had come to pray. It's a 15minute walk to The Louvre so would be a good idea to plan these tours for the same day."

The statues and stunning stained glass had me in awe, and the grandeur of the gothic architecture took my breath away. It was, in a way, a spiritual experience for this nonspiritual person. I recommend getting there at 7:30 am (they open at 7:45) and waiting to get in. The queue wasn't long at this time, but words can not express the experience of the first hour, of being in this amazing building with only about 10 or 20 other people, walking the vast halls and viewing each chapel in relative privacy, before the crowds get there at 9. Also, on the Monday I visited, there was a service that began at 8 and hearing it as you stroll through the cathedral just seemed to add something to it. A highly recommended experience when you visit Paris."

The best part about Notre Dame was the climb up the towers and onto the roof space. Seeing the huge bells, fantastic gargoyles, appreciating the history (having seen the charts of its 900 year development inside the cathedral and recognising some of the original roof shapes) and seeing the amazing view (even in the gloom of a rainy day). If you had asked me in the queue (there are no advance tickets with \"skip the line\"), I would have said it can't be worth this huge, crawling wait on a wet and dreary day! We nearly gave up. There didn't seem to be many people (? About 50) but it took around an hour as they only let a small group through at a time.

To think that these shockingly high ceilings of super-heavy solid stone were constructed with just scaffolding, starting back in the 1200's to 1300's AD... and with no modern cranes to lift and position such heavy objects to such lofty heights... is unimaginable. Another great thing about the Notre Dame Cathedral is that admission is free, and you are welcome to take photos (with or without flash) inside. In contrast, the greatest cathedral of England... Westminster Abbey... charges a whopping $30 per person just to walk inside, and after paying that high fee... any photos are absolutely forbidden. Knowing that makes you appreciate the policy of free admission and photos being welcome at the Notre Dame Cathedral."

The detail and colours and the stained glass just had be in awe. Will definitely be returning one day to get a second glance at this amazing historical church and the history of it."

I definitely recommend you arrive early, as the lines start early and in the afternoon it becomes too crowded. I arrived at 9AM. When you arrive, the first thing I recommend is that you get in line for the \"Tower Climb\". The line for that is on the side of the cathedral (the side facing the street). You should be physically able to climb 300 steps, but it is well worth it, you'll get great views of Paris and the bells. If you bought the \"Museum Pass\", the tower climb is included. After that, you need to get in line again for general admission to view the nave. After you complete your visit, you may also visit the nearby \"Deportation Memorial\" which is just a short walk away. There is also a nice park behind the cathedral if you would like to sit outside for a bit and if you're lucky, someone will be singing or playing music in the park."

The Metro stop drops you right near the cathedral. A suggestion that I would make is that if you are going to take the 387 stairs to the top, is that head off to the left and do that first. The line to get into the church itself moves quickly all the time. The line to go up the stairs to the top of the church is much slower and limited to about 35 at a time from the best we could tell.An observation we made was that lots of folks had the Paris Pass and showed it to the person that allowed people in and he always directed them to the end of the line. The Paris Pass does not allow you to skip the line at Notre Dame. You get to wait along with everyone else. There is a wall that you can sit on while waiting so it is not too bad. The view from the top is great.Gargoyles and the old bells make for a fun adventure. When you finally get to the top level you are limited to 30 minutes because up and down use the same stairway to get to the top. So you may find yourself waiting a bit to get up top.The church itself is wonderful. We were lucky to have a young peoples choir singing inside the Cathedral. It made the visit even more special.Highly recommended!"

Unfortunately, everyone else thinks that too, so when you go, bring your patience.The building is an incredible feat of engineering and it really is easy to place yourself as a parishioner of 200, 500, or 1000 years ago. The church holds mass at noon, and it is nice to sit down and observe (I am not Catholic, but still enjoy seeing something different, which is what a European adventure is all about!). Remember, in addition to your patience for the crowds, bring your respect too, as it is still an active church (remove your hat, speak softly, and wear appropriate attire). I would recommend taking the Metro station to Pont Marie and then walking towards Notre Dame from the south to really appreciate this amazing structure- it is also less crowded on this route."

The only thing I regret is not being able to do the audio guide tour as that opens at 9 or 9.30am (I cannot remember the specific time). But, just taking in the detail, design and beauty of the place was something to remember. And the fact that there was almost no one inside was a plus. All other attractions that we went to had lots of school trips and guided tours where people just did not respect the need for silence in places of worship. So, even though I would have wanted to do the audio guide tour, it was also not a bad thing that we went that early.Another advantage of going that early? Getting an almost perfect picture of the cathedral from the outside without crowds milling about the square in front of it. :)"

But the climb to the Gargoyles Gallery is steep, 400 narrow and claustrophobic steps. Avoidable for kids and senior citizens. Now the gallery is fenced off with a wire mesh. Photos do come out ok but not like you will see posted on web. If you are not too interested in the Gargoyles, avoid, the view from the Tour Montparnasse is much better!"

But it is a Catholic Church first so for practicing Catholics, it can be a much more meaningful experience by attending mass while there! Plan ahead to get a seat if you can. However if the pews are full, go to the far left side up front where you can still participate (though not kneel) and take communion. At the end of the mass, the organist played dramatic and beautiful music. Take note that tourists are still wandering about around the church during mass. You can also partake of holy water and sit quietly at one of many chapels around the outside. Once emptied of mass-goers, the place can hold so many people that there is not a line or if there is, it goes quickly. No charge to enter."

We sat through mass to say we \"did it\". Afterwards, we walked around and say the history of the building being built over centuries. Wonderful!"

For anyone that has read \"Pillars of the Earth' this is the image for Ken Follet words. Cue and pay to do the climb. Even though it was grey and miserable when I went so worth it. Just remember to time correctly ... noon means lots of bell ringing as I found out, but all part of the fab memory."

Its a big climb but worth it and its split into stages as you visit the bell tower and then the top of the roof and then the top of the tower. The view was amazing again, its a lovely way of seeing Paris. Inside is impressive! definitely worth taking the time to go inside."

After seeing the inside of the cathedral, we decided to stay in line to go up to the top of it. The line was not very long but the wait was long. It was kind of chilly staying outside for so long. Many times I want to give up and many people did. I am glad I did not leave. It is breath taking of the view on top. There is different perspective of different angles viewing of Paris when one is on top. We went inside to check out the giant bell. It was amazing. Just to remind visitor that it is free to visit the cathedral but it costs ten euro to go up to the top and long wait (over 2.5 hours for us.)"

This time, while inside, all of a sudden, a choir dressed in their red robes entered and proceeded to sing the most beautiful songs. Truly inspiring!!! Be sure to go to the back side of the cathedral for the view."
