            "review": "Definitely worth it! . This is my second time in Paris. The first time we skipped it because of the queue but this time we went and it was amazing. I would recommend going in the afternoon, around 4 p.m. Because we were there around 11, and by 11:30 the line was huge. We waited an hour, but the people a while behind us maybe double that. Once you get in, you can see why the wait is so long. There are about 400 stairs, and in some places are very narrow, which means it's one way traffic only (hence the very long queue). I would definitely recommend this. Like many things in France, it's free for EU citizens. I think it's around 10 euro for others. If you're mobility challenged, very unfit or claustrophobic, this might be a very difficult activity as there are no breaks for the 400 stairs, you just need to keep going up and often it's too narrow for others to overtake you. Amazing veiws from the top."

Firstly, be advised that the website states that part of the readings are in English---what this really means is the readings are available in written form in English, which is okay. This particular mass (when we were there) was packed with tourists, like ourselves, attending the mass while others were walking around looking at the cathedral. The priest used a GREAT DEAL of incense---so, if incense bothers you, don't go. We were sitting in the back and the incense still bothered my husband. Due to the number of people during mass, the church was warm, which made it uncomfortable. I would go to mass at Notre a Dame again---my husband would not. I took the tour of the Cathedral and enjoyed it very much. It is a beautiful structure and the side and rear alters are just magnificent. It is an amazing place."

Wanted to climb the 300+ steps to the towers, but line was too long.. Girls in the park next to the river wanted signatures and money for some scam. Wave them away and enjoy a quick break from the crowds in front of the cathedral.. Captured a great view of the building from the back side via river boat tour. Cross the bridge for souvenir shops and food."

This attraction opens at 10am, but you will need to get in line no later than 9am to avoid a huge line. Line forms on the north side of the cathedral. Enjoy a coffee and some conversation with fellow tourists while you wait, you will be glad you got there early as you look behind you and see the line! Access to this feature is 10 euros.This is a fairly strenuous climb. Only attempt if you can climb about 15 flights of stairs continuously. It is a winding and narrow staircase. First climb takes you to a balcony of sorts between the towers. At this point, you have the option of continuing to climb to the top of the south tower for the ultimate views. Catch your breath here, marvel at the architecture, and then continue to the top. It's worth it."

I think this is the most visited and famous church in the world not only because of its wonderful architecture but also for the fame that Victor Hugo gave to this church. Esmeralda and CasimodoI should add one important thing : There are two queues for the church : one for climbing to the top of the church with the narrow staircase ( approximately 385 steps) by which you can watch Paris under your foot . The entrance fee is about 10 Euros but it is worth trying it.2) Another line/queue to the main entrance ( inside the church ) is free but long. You can see the Gothic architecture with the statues of the bishops and ....Also, you can find a beautiful scene covered with many pigeons around you in front of the big statue of Charlemagne . Your little children would enjoy feeding the pigeons.Do not hesitate about my advice and come to visit this beautiful church and Seine River beside it."

Grab a crepe from the stand across from the queue and wait your turn to climb the towers. I would suggest going to see the cathedral (free) and get in line to see the towers ~ 40 minutes before the towers open (not free, but it is part of the museum pass). I was able to be in the first group this way. They only let a certain amount of people (~20 ish) up at a time, so if you're not part of the first couple of groups, it may take a while. I loved seeing the gargoyles and the views are great. There's a resting point in the giftshop - buy whatever you want at this point because you don't come down the same way. If you have concerns about being slow up the stairs, just make sure you're at the end of the group after the giftshop stop...there's less pressure to move quickly up the stairs this way."

We stood in line and got in quickly- as the line moved fast- this is a free admission- the church is very old and there is a display showing how the church was built and changed over the years. Mass was going on , and people were still allowed in the church and you need to be quiet . There is a lot of thick dust on some of the statues -the Rose windows are amazingly beautiful! Such history and beauty"

We had tickets to climb to the top which was an amazing view all over Paris. The guide took us up to the first level and we could make the choice to continue or not. Some went back down with the guide, I was tempted to go back down but decided to continue and so happy I did the view is specular and you can take your time getting up but it wasn't to bad after all.

You may not understand the affect to this day of enormity and profound inspiration, unless you stood before something even bigger. I've been to some natural wonders that would dwarf this place, but the beauty and splendor of nature has its own quality. The Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris is shere perspective that penetrates into the mind, even unto the soul and spirit. This is a carry-over from the enlightenment that I hope will continue to provide this experience. If you don't believe me, stand before the altar in the center of the cathedral and look up. Take in visually what you see above you and get a feeling for the shere scale and inspiration of yourself and the entire building. Astounding. I hope you can see it too!"

The towers are climbing a bunch of stairs in a spiral staircase with 20ish people at a time all in a line up to the very top of Notre Dame. It's very beautiful but very grueling as you feel like you must keep up with the group and there isn't much space for people to pass. The line was very long, we went around 10am and had to wait about an hour. You first walk up a bunch of stairs where you can than purchase your ticket, than you walk up more stairs and are on the flat part in the middle. It has great views of the Eiffel Tower and that view of Paris. You can also see gargoyles up close which is really cool. You can also go up in a bell tower and see one of the bells and take your picture with it. Than you move up to the very top of the towers where you get a 360 degree view of the city. Please note, you're doing all this as a group, you can't wander on your own very much and it's limited time. Very cool and I loved it I would suggest you see it. The tower line is on the left of the cathedral if you're looking at the front."

Once you have paid we found that we were not given any instructions on where to go next and found that we were waiting in the shop area for a good 10mins before we found out where we had to go next. Recommended for the view and the experience of being on the Notre Dame but be warned that if you have issues with lungs/heart etc that this is not recommended."

Since this attraction is entitled the \"Tours\" of Notre Dame, I'm assuming it's supposed to cover the Tower climb activity, which is seperate from the entry to the cathedral itself (and the tower climb is not free, though it is covered by the Paris Museum Pass).Queue up for the tower at the northwest corner -- or rather, at the line that starts at that point. The queue usually seemed to stretch for much of the length of the cathedral itself along its north side. But no problem: it tended to move quickly, as visitors were admitted periodically in groups of 25.The tower climb is in three stages along spiral staircases: first to a giftshop, then after a short wait, up to the gallery at the level of the bells. The bell room can be accessed via very small entryways from the gallery; note there the huge, ancient wooden beams.It's here on the gallery where one gets the closest look at the iconic Notre Dame gargoyles. it's a bit of trick trying to shoot through the fine netting that's been erected -- I wonder if it was added because folks had been losing their phones while holding them out over the edge while taking photos...?In places, the gallery is a bit of a tight squeeze, but in every direction it provides wonderful views over the city: from the front (toward the west) is the best. There one can see the Eiffel Tower and to the right of it, the L'Defense complex, and below, the long line of folks waiting to enter the cathedral proper.Then it's up another tighter staircase to the very top of the south tower. Here I found the best view of Mont Martre, which lies to the north by west.In summary, the tour climb might not be for the weak or those with no head for heights, but for anyone else, with much exertion comes much reward."

The towers are open late on Fridays and Saturdays.The climb can be difficult but it is worth it! You are up close and personal with gargoyles and the incredible exterior of the church. The bells are impressive in size and structure. And the top tower is worth the extra climb. We went at dusk and saw the city lit up!

From my understanding there were two lines, one for those who had booked tours, that wrapped around the building and were at least 150 people deep, and then there was a second line to purchase tickets, that went out into the square, and wrapped around itself a few times, making it impossible to count how many people were in line. So instead we settled for walking around the Cathedral, and just standing in awe of the amazing architecture. I regret not deciding to do a tour of the Notre Dame Cathedral and booking in advance, but at the very least it is a very worthwhile walk to and around."

When we entered, it was not too crowded, but very crowded as the morning progressed.There was a mass going on, but tourists were allowed in the area surrounding the main sanctuary (church). The mass was beautiful as was th music, but not for anyone easily distracted by crowds. There was security outside the church grounds given the new heightened awareness in Paris. The beauty of the church is breathtaking and the windows live up to expectation. Outside, the view with the towers is very impressive. There is a new shrine outside to Pope John Paul II on the grounds. If one just wants to observe the architecture, the large plaza (shown in this picture) makes that possible. There are tourist shops about 200 feet to the left of this plaza so you can plan to buy reasonably priced souvenirs during the trip. I believe that there is a small shop inside the church as well for religious articles."

Get there at least a half hour before they open up the steps (which is later than when the church interior opens. This is the only line we spent a good deal of time in - an hour. Here is my advice. Buy the museum pass! Go early and enjoy the interior of Notre Dame before they open the climb. Download Rick Steves app and walking tour (you can listen to it through earbuds offline.) If you are not traveling alone, go immediately to the line to make the climb and then you can take turns taking a bathroom break (look behind the sculpture of Charlemagne - it will cost 80 cents.)"

Climbing to the top of the towers of Notre Dame is a great way to see the city and to experience the cathedral. There are lots of steps - all part of the spiral staircases that lead up to the top. Claustrophics, beware. But the climb and the price of admission are rewarded with up-close views of the many different gargoyles who guard the towers at their base, and then again at the very top. Just know that you're going to wait a while in the summer - get in line at least 45 minutes before the tower climb opens up - the line forms alongside the cathedral on the left. You'll have the best pictures of your whole trip!"

Of course this place has long lines and that's understandable because it Paris, but what I didn't appreciate at the time was that there are Two lines, one to go inside the cathedral part and one to climb up to the top. By the time we realized this, the line was down the block and around the corner. Therefore, I can only comment on the cathedral. The audio guide is extra, so we didn't get it. It probably made it hard to appreciate what was inside but we followed a tour outlined in a book we had. It was interesting and beautiful, but I bet the upstairs would have been more interesting."

After everyone has purchased tickets you will be allowed up the stairs. Once there you can wind around the pathway and into the bell tower.

We were second in line, by 9:20 you couldn't see the end of the line behind us. After you climb about 20 steps, you enter a gift shop where you purchase your admission ticket. At this point, it is HIGHLY recommended that you purchase a Paris museum pass. It will cover not only your admission to the tower climb, but most all of the other museums you will want to see in Paris. Second, you must be in fairly good physical condition to do this climb without undue effort. There are 423 (or so) steps to the top of the tower. You climb about 3/4 of the way up then stop at a walkway between the two towers. At this point, you can either continue on up to the top of one tower or go back down. The climb from there on up is steep and windy, a person of size would have a fair amount of difficulty making this climb comfortably. Also, once you start up, you must continue on to the point of the walkway between the towers. Now, once you are up, the views are magnificent! It is definitely worth the effort. Once you come down, you can go inside and see the beautiful cathedral itself."

From the organ to the stained-glass windows and various sanctums within the cathedral, it acts as a magnet to the faithful, those who appreciate architecture, history and the magnitude of her place - both in Paris and the world.Naturally, the cathedral is a magnet for tourist and is best seen in the early morning before the throngs of tourists descend upon it. The best time of year is also when it's low tourist-season."

If you're looking for a good view of Paris, nothing beats the Arc de Triomphe. The gargoyles were cool and that was pretty much it.Tip #1- Carry a water bottle when climbing the steps.Tip #2- Skip the bell towers all together and see the inside of the Notre Dame Cathedral (free of charge).

Museum pass DOES NOT allow you to skip the line. Lots of stairs, so wear walking shoes. Best to do this on a clear day, as the views of the Paris skyline are a big part of the experience, in my opinion. You see some neat areas, including close-ups of statues and the famous gargoyles, plus you can get right under the tower bells, which is pretty neat too. Think about how this cathedral was constructed without modern tools while you walk around - quite a feat!"

The Crown of Thorns are in the Cathedral and most people pass them by. We wouldn't have seen them except for our guide pointing them out.

You enter at the side, not the main entrance. You do not pay for entry to Notre Dame but you pay for entry to the towers. There are a lot and lots of steps. There is a rest point on the 1st floor at the gift shop but the steps to this point aren't too bad. The next set of steps are a little steeper with one doorway about half way up that 1 or 2 people could stop to rest in if required. Your next stop leads to the bell towers and has some beautiful views. There is an area with two bells, which have an open wooden staircase but it is only a short distance. All other stairs are stone and enclosed. Once viewing the bells, which is optional, you then have the choice to exit or go to the top. You have to queue as numbers are restricted at any one time on the top level. The staff control this. If you want to exit go up to the rope and let the staff know, so you aren't stuck in the queue. The stairs to the top floor are very winding and steep with no rest point. I wouldn't be very fit and I managed it, my legs did feel like jelly for around an hour after. I wouldn't recommend for anyone with fear of heights or mobility issues. You are surrounded by safety fences. Some of the turns around the corners are quite tight but perfectly safe. Don't forget, once you get to the top, you then have to go all the way back down."

They let in about 20 people every 15 mins... so do the maths of how long you might wait.... long !- For people who are scared of heights, this one is suitable as there is a high rampart and fence all along the outside areas... and the snail staircase has a middle-filled post.- You might have an unpleasant surprise close to the opening though. as the access to the bell tower and roof are weather-permitting. If it's too windy (not street-level wind conditions), these areas are closed. The issue is that, contrary to the church itself, personnel of the towers don't install fences nor boards with daily info until about 9:50... so you might have waited for a while and still not have access to it all. This is really something they should improve on.- There are NO options to buy tickets ahead of time"

Only attempt the steps if you are reasonably fit as they are steep and there are over 400 up and 400 down. I definitely felt my legs shaking the rest of the day after doing it! But the views from up there make it totally worth it. The gargoyles have to be seen. Pictures don't do them justice. Do the skip the line tour of Notre Dame including the Bell Tower for the best value. You will have a short walk from the Cite Metro line over the bridge and to the cathedral. The guide will tell you wonderful stories about the history of the area and the towers."

You also have access to the inside of the bell tower - very cool. Then turn around and take in the panoramic views of historic Paris. Great perspective of the area and the city. The steps are actually divided into three stages so it is less taxing than the number of stairs might suggest. The tourist areas are securely protected and felt safe. This helped reduce my fear of heights.Even with wobbly knees this was a great memory of Paris. Well worth the wait. Access is not at through the main doors, but is on the north side of the building (so the left side if you are looking at the front doors)."

It is my all time favorite view of Paris because you can see all of the monuments, including the Eiffel Tower, and the gargoyles are very cool. I would definitely recommend going earlier or later when the line is not as long because it ends up taking up a lot of your day if you are waiting in line for hours. Once you get in, there is a ticket booth to buy tickets to go to the top, we got in free as students with a visa from Italy. It is not actually that bad of a climb and the view is worth the money and time (maybe not 2 and a half hours, but definitely an hour or less)."

Plenty of opportunities to take pictures/selfies/etc. They have fence like barriers so no one can fall off, but there are parts cut out for a good photo.Here is the strange part, if you want souvenirs, buy them when getting the tickets.

I can recommend the skip the line options offered by a number of companies as this probably saved us several hours of time. It might cost a bit more but a competent tour guide speaking your own language makes the experience so much better. If you are physically able to climb tight circular stairs then adding this option into your tour will is a great bonus. I think it's 420 up and the same down. I loved getting up close to the gargoyles and the views over the city were really good.While we were enjoying the view the bells rang out really loudly, what an experience! They only let limited numbers climb at a time so its not too crowded. There are limited catch your breath spots during the climb but we did find a couple of chairs outside the bells.The morning we visited 5 May 2016 they had a full mass so there was a lot of atmosphere inside the church as well.Recommend this as a must do attraction."

Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris (\u5df4\u9ece\u8056\u6bcd\u9662, \"Our Lady of Paris\u201d) is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the eastern part of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 (\u897f\u5824\u5cf6) in the fourth arrondissement of Paris, France. The Notre-Dame Cathedral celebrated its 850th anniversary of laying the first building block for the cathedral on December 12, 2012. The North Tower on top of Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame was completed in 1240 and the South Tower in 1250.  We tried to visit the towers after we visited the Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris. We arrived around 5 pm, but it was too late although the official time of the visit is 10 am to 6:30 pm in April. We tried again next morning before 10 am, but there already had 20 people in the line. After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were able to start our journey to the top of Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame. It was a narrow 387-step (69 m / 226 ft) climb up the spiral staircase. The first stop was the upper room of the North Tower where the ticket counter and souvenir shop were located. We also noticed an elegant small spiral staircase inside the upper room. We continued the climb to the Chimera gallery after a short rest. You can see not only the magnificent views over Paris, but also lots of strange beasts known in French as \u2018Les Chim\u00e8res\u2018 that are located here. Those Chimera creatures looked like birds or monsters were looking down to the city, observing all the people in Paris for several hundred years. We could even see the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur from a distance. This was not the end of the tour -- we continued our climb to the top of South Tower. There were many gargoyles on top of the North and South Towers. These decorated waterspouts were designed to deliver water from the roof and keep the water away from the cathedral. On the top of cathedral, we saw all the famous landmarks and enjoyed a 360 degree view of Paris. Don\u2019t miss the opportunity to go inside the small wooden door. Behind the door is the famous, oldest and largest 13,271 kg (29,258 lb) Emmanuel bell, which has been a part of the building since 1681.  One thing I could not believe was there were so many smokers in Paris. They smoke even when they are walking. When we queued up at the entrance of the Tower Tour, they smoke regardless non-smokers and children. The French advocate freedom, but they should also respect others. The entrance for the visit of the tower is located outside of the cathedral on the left-hand side of the fa\u00e7ade, on Rue du Clo\u00eetre Notre-Dame. It costs \u20ac8.5 for an adult."

The height of this building shocked me somewhat as i expected it to be smaller ( viewing the top from the other side of the Seine ) The doorway is covered in sculptures too many to list.

The stairs were broken down in two level, after climbing a few steps, you will enter ticket office/book store then climb a few more stair ( a lot) you get to the level where you see the gargoyles up close. You can see the two bells. Then you climb more steps to the top.The views were breathtaking. I liked it better than the view from Arc de Triomphe.If you need to buy souvenirs, buy it when you get to the bookstore, because you won't be able to go back there on the way out. When we climb down, the door to the bookstore was closed. Lucklily, we already bought some souvenirs on the way.Try arrive 45 minutes before it opens. We arrived 10 minutes before and waited an hour and half. What made it hard was lots of people smoke, so we were inhaling second hand smoke for one and half hours."

Walking inside the cathedral takes you back in time. The long history of the church is outlined in intricate marble sculptures that force you to think, how did they do that? The grandiose stain glass windows illuminate the church spectacularly. That being said, the real treat is going up into the cathedral bell towers. Although the nearly 250 steps is going to be a bit much for some, the payoff is well worth it if you can do it. Personally, I don't think you can claim you where in Paris unless you do this. We loved going to the top of the Eiffel but it didn't compare to the cathedral towers IMHO. It's at the top that you get to witness Paris through the eyes of the gargoyles. It's a spectacular view. Tip: get there early and if you can swing it, pay for one of the \"skip the line\" tours available as the lines are long. If you can't, I would strongly encourage you to wait in line(separate from the line to get inside the church itself). The towers compare closely with walking up in to the dome at St Peters Basilica in Rome. It too is a tremendous and exhausting hike up many many stairs but one of the things we've done that we still talk about many years later. We will be discussing our morning at the Cathedral Towers for many years to come too."

When you enter, you are aware of how grandiose this space is, but it is quite dark. It's a little difficult to see some of the great aspects of this cathedral. I would also recommend going up the towers if you're up for climbing many stairs. Seeing those famous gargoyles up close is a fun experience. So, go see Notre Dame. see it from all the sides, hang out in the park behind it (there's free wifi too!), just be aware that you will be in that line for ages and that you mostly just make a loop around the inside and then leave."

They take people up in groups of 20 to buy tickets at the gift shop, then after all 20 buy their tickets, then they let you proceed up the steps to the next part, the Gallery of the Chimeras. Just a note, the workers come to work at 1000 and then set up the stanchions to control the line, so we actually got let in to go up the stairs to buy tickets at 1035 (viva la France)"

An amazing place that fills your heart as you walk around in awe and definitely on your bucket list when visiting Paris. The day I was there it began to snow outside, something that will never leave my mind. I visited the Cathedral via the Batobus, which is a service that is run on the Seine but being winter it runs every 40 mins so I wasn't able to visit all 8 points of interest. At a cost of about 16 Euro it is certainly worth it and a great way of seeing Paris. This can be caught across the road from the Eiffel Tower."

I have tried to visit the Towers of Notre Dame many times and have always been put off by the long wait, this time I decided to wait and finally see the famous bell, 'Emmanuel'.The queue was long and boring, thank goodness for the little stores that line the road that you are queuing on - it took us 2 1/2 hours to finally get in! Make sure you are aware of this and wear comfortable shoes, and maybe bring a book.Once past the queue you must pass through a security check, you need to open your bag to allow the guard to check inside.You then begin to climb the stairs..... this is not for the faint heart and there is no other option but the stairs. You have been warned.Taken to a shop and ticket office, if you want anything, buy now as you won't get the chance to go back. Take this opportunity to get ready for more and more stairs.Once at the top you can see stunning views of Paris and the details of the sculptures on the walls and roof. Despite the wait and the stairs, this was worth it and I am so so pleased that I took my time and really enjoyed everything I was able to see."

Unfortunately nearly all of the descriptions were in French only so some Google translation was required.The queue was relatively small when we arrived in the morning, although it had increased quite a lot by 12:30 pm.

Across from The Louvre,up the street from Musee d'Orsay and a gorgeous summer stroll with the breeze in my hair and face,to The Eiffel Tower. What almost reduced me to tears was the sight of the Towers of Notre Dame Cathedral! I have read The Hunchback Of Notre Dame so many times that I could NOT believe I was standing in front of the very place that inspired this historic book. I'm a proud man but crying here is a must. This place defines Paris for me. It always will. Going back in July when I plan to spend a whole day inside and out so if you see a grown man crying that is me!"

If there is one sight in paree that isn't likely to leave you indifferent, it's this one... dramatically towering alongside the banks of the Seine. To call it breathtaking is simplistic... it's overwhelming when you consider it took labourers over a hundred years to complete. Who doesn't remember the haunting image of Quasimodo, Hugo's anti-hero swingin'dem bells from its famous bell tower or the scary gargoyles that literally make you stop in your tracks... grotesque, yet captivatingly beautiful.. Inside, the stunning rose window has been courting and seducing millions of travellers and is without a doubt one of Paris's wonders.But many come here for the spiritual comfort or creepy interest to gawk at the archeological crypt. Over all, for sheer aesthetic grandeur it takes a lot to beat, being the apex in the Gothic pantheon with a harmony that focuses all your senses, especially its facade which is recognisable all over the world. One has to stand still at the end of its plaza and allow the grand vista to sweep over you. I love its portals and the series of 28 statues representing the Kings of Israel. Not even its Grand Gallery can avert your eyes from its imposing ornate towers which, when you have climbed the requiem of stairs, offer a view from its eerie that looks down a plunge of 68 mt over the IIe de la Cite, the Seine and the whole city.... just a few steps to climb... all 400 of them, shuffling behind the constant flow of minions or devotees training for marathons. I love the rear facade... its perspective is as beautiful as its front with those stunning Gothic spires. You would find it hard to find in Paris better example of Medieval history, and Paris certainly abounds with enough treasures, yet nowhere is it as hauntingly gorgeous as this grand dame's long halls, vaulted ceilings with soft light filtering through the intricate stained glass that elevates medieval history regarding divinity and humanity. Just like royalty, a queen to be specific, the cathedral welcomes the visitor to its grandeur... but wait till you see her twin sister, just north of the city in St-Denis, whose basilica and royal necropolis will knock your socks off."

We visited on a Saturday and it was busy but still possible to get a good photo as long as you get the right position. We also visited them at night to get the illuminated shot which was spectacular. Wrap up if going at night as the square gets breezy.We stopped by a little bakery nearby and got a walnut brownie to eat at the site and sat for around 10-15 minutes just taking in the view.Be cautious however as there are street sellers hanging around as the area is typically quite touristy.Do remember to take a camera however as you won't want to miss the opportunity!"

Great views as well - better than the Eiffel Tower, in my opinion - so well worth climbing the steps for. As there is restricted space in the towers, they only allow a certain number of people in at a time though so be prepared to wait a bit to get in, but it's a must do if it's your first trip to Paris."

I can understand why there are long queues as there is only room for a single file and the guards need to wait for a number of people to leave the tower roof before they can allow more people up. If the first group is spell bound by the view and are taking a long time to take photos or just take in the view it would add to the waiting time of those below."

So the lines start packing up quite early in the day, so you'll want to get there at around 8am if you want to get up there early. The climb itself is predictably pretty harsh and strenuous, so it's not advisable to any little children or elderly people. However for everyone else it's definitely well worth the walk up to the top. The officials usually send 20 people up at a time and wait for the groups of people to go down before sending more up.The views are well worth the price to go up. Because of the location and the lower height, the views even shame the Eiffel Tower. The front facing view is the main feature, but the left and even back facing views are almost as good. If you are bringing large photographic equipment though do be warned that it is very narrow up the top, so no large bags or tripods."

Notre Dame is worth a quick visit to see what the fuss is about, but there's nothing spectacular to warrant going out of your way, especially if you've seen other cathedrals across Europe. However, it's located on the island in the middle of the city, so you'll undoubtedly have to walk pass it at some point. To get here, the nearest metro station is Cite on Line 4. If you plan on using the metro frequently--which isn't a necessity because Paris is a fairly walkable town--buy a carnet of 10 metro tickets for 14.10 euros, rather than paying 1.80 euros for each ticket individually. The 1-Day Mobilis tickets (for unlimited 24-hr use of public transit) are only economical if you plan on using public transportation more than 4 trips per day since it costs 7 euros."

I truly believe this is a little bit of a somewhat hidden gem of Paris (in comparison to other highlights)When facing the front of Notre-Dame if you go down the left side of the building. There you will find a line. This is a line to go up into the towers.The towers are in the Paris Museum Pass which I highly recommend for anyone going to 2 or more of any of the museums, attractions and city highlights.I would suggest going on a clear day as when you get up there the beautiful view of Paris is even better without the smog/haze. Also go in the early morning or late afternoon when there is not to much sun on the line area. As you may sit there for at least an hour +. Go with a friend if possible and take turns in the line. As with all major Paris attractions there are plenty of places to get food, drinks and souvenirs. Also with all popular Paris attractions watch out for the pick pockets and con artists. If you can hold out on eating high priced fast snack food in the area i would suggest strolling across Pont de l'Archev\u00each\u00e9 bridge and sitting in one of the lovely bistros along the river.This is not an attraction for people with disabilities, heart conditions or who have very poor health. There are allot of stairs and the passage is very very narrow in some places. So if you are claustrophobic or very afraid of heights skip this.It can take at least 15min to climb to the top and that is at a good pace. They give you a time limit when at the top to see the view and take pictures. The catwalk up there is very narrow and very high. But if you can get over all that the view is so worth it."

Residents of France come here to worship (although I really don't see how with all the tourists).

If you cluster-phobic , then going up to the top is not for you. The architecture is rather fascinating with the narrow pathways around the top and odd sculptures on the corners. The stained glass works are also impressive.Just a tip when visiting the souvenir shops across the street... If you have the time, Just browse through them all first( there are 4/5 ) , found that certain items were much cheaper (up to 50%) when compared.And, i am serious about their being 300 odd, closer to 400 narrow windy stairs!!

I would definitely not recommend this for anyone not prepared to climb the steps. They only allow a certain number of people up to the different stages (for obvious, safety reasons). This is what caused the long wait.

This was my second time up the towers, and it was the thing I wanted to do most in Paris because I had fond memories from my time up in 2006. The view from atop the cathedral is beautiful and the gargoyles are incredible. You can also visit two bells, which is always a nice treat. The architecture of the cathedral is impressive and my memory really didn't let me down: beautiful gargoyles, statues, clocks... everywhere!Even so, I've decided to only give this attraction three stars, and that's because of the overall experience. The towers open at 10 am. We went there at 9.30 and the line was already about as long at the cathedral itself. They only let people in in groups of about 20 because the top is very small.Ten o'clock went by and the line didn't move at all. I left my husband in the line and went to the front to check out what was happening. Some workers went in, gave some surly looks, didn't say anything. Finally, at around 10.30, a worker came out of the towers and hung up a piece of paper saying they were on strike. So we wasted time waiting in line for nothing--and I don't even want to imagine how long the poor people at the very front of the line had been waiting!The strikes alternated: work one day, strike one day. I tried to find a reason for the strikes, but the only news I could find online was from almost a year prior, where it mentioned that the workers had gone on strike to protest against pickpocketers. So that's clever, isn't it? Protest against pickpocketers by leaving the tourists outside like easy prey waiting in line for an attraction that won't open, but tourists don't know it won't open because workers don't declare they're on strike until half an hour after opening time? Fabulous...Despite that, I still really wanted to visit the towers because I knew my husband would love seeing the gargoyles up close. I calculated which day the workers wouldn't be on strike and it was our very last day in Paris. We got in line at 10 am and had to wait for almost two hours. All in all, it was a long wait but I think it could have been worse. The wait is outside and there's absolutely nothing to cover you, so pray for mild weather.Pickpockets thrive around Notre Dame, so beware! The very first thing we saw the day we arrived in Paris was a group of police officers searching a group of girls who clearly looked like professional pickpocketers.While waiting in line for the towers, we were approached the same group of girls we'd seen on our first day. They use the age-old technique of distracting you with a fake petition while they surround you and take everything they can. My husband gave them a rotund \"Leave!\" when they approached, so they gathered around another tourist a little bit ahead. My blood was boiling because the tourist was so concentrated trying to read the petition--the trick was working--and he was already surrounded. I went over there and shouted out \"Ignore them! They want to steal from you!\" several times and the girls stuck their tongues out at me and vanished. We didn't see them bothering anyone else in the line that morning.The fee to go up the towers is 8,5\u20ac. The moment you finally get into the tower, you have to climb several flights of stairs until you reach a tiny gift shop where you buy your tickets. Then, it's back to the stairs until you reach the first viewpoint where all the gargoyles are. It's beautiful to just stand there and look at all the details, but it can be tricky to take good photos because, apart from the wire fixture encasing the entire gallery, now they've also added a thick black net. It's practically impossible to take a picture of a person and a gargoyle or the views at the same time because the big black net obstructs the views and the statues.After another flight of stairs, you can visit the very top of the tower and there's protective glass. There's a worker up there with you hurrying you along. It turns out there's a sign that says you can only stay up there for maximum five minutes. Once the five minutes are up, the worker starts calling everyone to go back down and leave.The exit leaves you right by entrance of the cathedral, on the other side of the building. It's a real shame that the visit to the towers doesn't connect with the inside of the cathedral. Right at the exit door, there should be access to the cathedral because, after waiting in the cold for two hours, who wants to wait another extra hour to go inside? Plus, entrance to the cathedral is free, so if you've already paid to go into the towers, it would be fabulous if after your visit you could directly access the interior.But that's asking too much, I'm afraid."

By 10am you were unable to see the end of the line. I definetly recommend getting there early as they only allow groups of 20 access into the tower every ten minutes. Keeping the numbers small at the top of the tower led to a more enjoyable experience as you were able to move around without fighting your way through the crowds. There are alot of stairs and small spaces to fit through so you need to be reasonably fit and not at all claustrophobic to visit the tower. Make sure you buy anything you want from the gift shop before you visit the tower as you can't get back to it."

You will be out of breath & there are no bathroom in. The way up is difficult, but the way down is much easier.Disappointment: thought the rang bell was the historic one, no it's not.One small gift shop is there.

It's not a terribly taxing climb and the views of the Cathedral and of Paris are incredible. Being able to see the chimera/gargoyles up close is remarkable. Just the sheer size and detail involved in the exterior of Notre Dame is hard to take in without being up in the towers and able to see it more closely. There are some small annoyances like tight spaces and people jumping in front of you to get their selfies in. Also, there are a few times where you are sort of stuck between sections while they wait for people to finish. This is a great crowd control measure, but it feels a bit mysterious since they don't tell you why you can't keep going (or at least I wasn't around when we were told). I thought it was very well-organized, safe, and must-do part of any trip to Paris."

The top three or four items in Paris are Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower, and then l'Arc de Triomphe, along with a walk down at least part of the Champs-Elysees. If you go to Paris and don't see these three sites, you are missing out. There are a million other things to do and places to eat, too, so plan on staying for two weeks or two months or two years!The bell tower is accessible by foot. It is important to review the tour guide for hours and arrive at least 1/2 hour to 1 hour earlier than when the line opens. The line moves very slowly. If you arrive during the day, you will wait 3-4 hours. If you get there early in the morning you'll be in the first group.If the weather is nice, take your breakfast at one of the cafes across the street and watch the line form and then get in line before there more than 10 or 20 people. The walking to the top is about 400 steps (I think?). The staircase is fairly narrow and is not suitable to persons who are not healthy."

Since I was with my elementary school aged nephews, we decided to give it a shot. Not only was it really cool for them to see the gargoyles up close, but it offered a spectacular, 360 degree view of the city including the Seine, the Eiffel Tower and Montmarte. The pictures of the gargoyles in the foreground with those landmarks in the background came out beautifully. I highly recommend it."

The climb is steep and the spiral staircase is dimly lit. Those with vertigo may be challenged by this climb.

The view of Paris is spectacular; and we love the crazy gargoyles; but it is a poor experience compared to 20 years ago; before the netting was so insanely tight that you can hardly take photos of anything without pulling at it; and it is even hard to maneuver around the corners. As well, the staff now hustle you along, even if it is not particularly crowded. They want an entire group out before the next one is allowed in. No loitering! It makes for a less enjoyable visit, but I guess the numbers now just demand this level of control. I expect that soon, getting in here will be a whole different matter, with heightened security. Avoid the corner restaurant across the street, which looks nice, and charges a fortune for coffee and even has paid toilets!"

We were fortunate to arrive in time to hear the bells of the church while outside, and the music during mass on the inside. You are not required to sit for the service, but may silently stroll along the edges of the church, soaking in history and possibly lighting a candle in prayer.

The line for the narrow staircase up to the Notre Dame towers start around an hour before it is officially open at 10a.m.- by 9:15a.m., there were about 20 people already in line and they only allow around 20 people up every 15 min. or so. It is well worth the efforts to climb up the 387 or so odd stairs up to the Tower. Before arriving to the West Tower, you will stop by a gift shop and this is where the admission fee of 8.50 euros is collected. You continue on the staircase until arriving at the top where the famous gargoyles and chimeras are found along with the wonderful views of the Paris skyline with the River Seine below. Views of St Chapelle and Montmartre are unbelievable from this point. It is quite narrow up here and you are encouraged to keep moving along to keep the flow of traffic going. There are no bathroom facilities until you go back down to ground level.Walking across from the North to South tower, look at both directions of the detailed architecture and for the famous Styrga -chimera-- a horn and wing beast with a human body holding his head in his hands and sticking his tongue out at Paris- used to scared off bad spirits. There are many different types of gargoyles as you look up from here also- they are used as rain gutters as the rain water drains out from their mouths.Make sure you walk in to see the famous 13 ton Emmanuel bell as well- made popular by Quasimodo in \"Hunchback of Notre Dame.\" Continue across to the South Tower on your left and up another set of narrow steps to the \"Sommet\"-- the summit-- you are only allowed a 5 minute visit here as it is very narrow. The views of the River Seine are totally incredible from here is you see how Notre Dame Cathedrale is located right smack in the middle of Ile de la Cite island. Great photo vantage points through the barbed wire.From here you begin your descent down which should not take that much time ~ 15-20 min. at the most. If you need to look for restrooms, they are located in the back of Notre Dame- where the flying buttresses are located- next to the park.Anyone can make it for this climb as my 81 year old mom was able to make it without any problems! She states that she is glad she made this climb for the superb views!"

All in all, if there is no line I would say this is a great attraction, just not worth the wait."

            "review": "Only if you don't mind waiting in many line ups. Note that visiting the Towers of Notre Dame is different than visiting inside the cathedral itself. Access to the tower is from the side of the cathedral and a fee is charged or you can get in with the Paris Museum Pass. There is NO priority line for those with a Museum Pass. We visited at the end of October and arrived at about 9:45 am - the tower opens at 10 am and there was a relatively large line up. As the access and exit points for the tower are limited, they allow in a bunch of people, and then there is a wait (10 minutes or so?) till the next group is let in. We made it in at around 10:30 am. You walk up a short flight of stairs to a small room where they sell the tickets. Everyone in the group has to wait here again till all have arrived. Then we climbed to the first level, which is cool as it gives a good view of the gargoyles and access to the belfry. The view over the city is also nice, but the mesh netting they've hung means that you won't be able to get good pictures if you have a DSLR. The small lenses on smartphones work fine. (Note - the netting obstructs the city view, not the gargoyle view.)The area here on this level is quite small so we made our way around it and ended up in line again. It turned out that we had to wait for the previous group to exit the top level before we could go up. The wait ended up being so long that we didn't even bother going up to the top level, and decided we'd rather just head straight back down rather than get caught in another line up somewhere along the way. We finally exited the tower at 11:30 - nearly two hours after getting in the original line up, and that was without going to the top deck. In our opinion, simply not worth it for the 10-15 minutes of total viewing time. There are lots of other places in the city that offer great views (Arc de Triomphe and Sacre Couer were two that we did) without the frustrating line ups."

We didn't make it in the first group but got in around 10 mins later and it was worth the hour wait.You walk in and first go up a steep winding staircase. This is relatively easy if you are fit but if not may be challenging. Some sections are also very narrow and may be claustrophobic to some people. When you reach the top the views are amazing and you can see the famous gargoyles.You can also enter the bell tower and see the two largest bells (and the place where Quasimodo lived in 'the hunchback of Notre Dame')After this you can go to the very top level and the views from there are even more spectacularDefinitely recommend this - worth the wait"

No it is not a complete new experience but it is a different experience nevertheless as for May years it front section or tower were covered to accommodate repair work over the years. Like most venerable sites it needs to be rejuvenated and maintained from time to time. I enjoyed my last visit almost as much as my first more than 30 years ago. This time we witnessed 7 ordinations, a first for me in Paris. Go on a day when there is a religious service to have a good feel for this place of worship.The quality of the repair work over the years are ensuring that many more generations will enjoy and appreciate one of the most important and visited historical site in the world.

When we visited, the towers opened at 10am and we arrived at 10:30am, by which time there was a fairly large queue, so perhaps get there earlier if you want to be ahead in the queue! We were fairly far back but we were in within an hour, which wasn't too bad. Once you are admitted in, be prepared to get those legs working because there are a LOT of stairs. But it is absolutely 100% worth it! The view is incredible up there, it's pretty magical. We took our time walking around and even went up the second set of stairs taking you to the very top, which was amazing.

The entrance is on the left outside of the church. The like was a littly long but went really fast. Seeing the inside of the old churh really gives you a great perspective and the views of the city are great. My daughter is tired of me dragging her through churched but really loved Notre Dame because of the tower."

The exterior of the church is an architecture beauty and the inside is just stunning with stained glass windows and grand altars."

It had been at least 6 years since I had been up the towers, and although I've been doing it since 1984, my continuing pleasure comes from accompanying students who have never been. This time we got in line by 8:30, which meant that once they opened at 10, we only had a short wait to get in. In the high tourist season, if you wait until10 to get in line, you'll be waiting for hours in the heat. So get there early.The climb is challenging - about 400 steps, I think. You'll be stopping regularly in order to wait for the groups in front of you to advance, because it's a one-way passage. So relax and enjoy the view. Do check out the belfry with the old bells from days past, and do go all the way around to the back so you can see the main steeple. The whole passage will take you 45 minutes or an hour, and there's also a nice garden area when you exit, so stop and take a rest there. Don't buy the overpriced food in the sandwich places across from where you stand in line. have someone hold your place and go a block or two further north where food is more reasonable. And then do lunch in the Quartier Latin."

It is stunning, beautiful, moving and absolutely massive. You MUST go see it. Notre Dame is free to enter and if there is a line to get in, it moves quickly. However, Notre Dame towers are a different story. There is a charge (I believe it's 8.5 Euro) to climb to the top. I've done this twice in my life and it's one of the most stunning views of Paris. You can see Sacre Coeur, Eiffel Tower and so much more. It's totally worth the climb (do suggest you're in good shape though- and that you're not claustrophobic). But this time, when we reached the top there was a bottleneck. At first we were able to move about, take great photos, enjoy the view, bond with the gargoyles...but then towards the opposite end of the towers, we got stuck and didn't move for about an hour. It seems that what happened was that they allow people up to the south tower, but because there's only one way up & down, they let people up, wait, and then let people down. In theory this may work, but on days with big crowds, it simply caused a huge bottleneck effect, confusion, and a group of annoyed tourists stuck on top of a tall building. It was incredibly frustrating and I felt like I wasted unecessary time. We had already waited over an hour to go up, and then to wait another 45 minutes to go down- it just didn't make sense. Poolry organized and not managed well to handle the crowds. It's a shame, because it's an amazing attraction."

Go early and avoid the crowds because it will surely be crowed during the middle of the day.

The kids loved finding all the similarities between what they saw in the movie and what they saw in person. This kept them really engaged and excited about our trip to Notre Dame and the bell towers. The stairs up the bell towers are plenty but we made a game out of it by calling my youngest \"the stair master\". She was so proud to be the stair master that she took on the lead role up and down the stairs and never complained once! We praised her for how strong her legs were and she just beamed with pride. My kids loved the gargoyles and took a ton of pictures of them. It was a fantastic day!"

One of the most spectacular structures in a city filled with spectacular, but long lines and a long wait for the towers makes it not as accessible as others. I would strongly recommend visiting the small Holocaust Memorial at the back of the structure, it is something you will not forget.Upside: Beautiful beyond measure, this is also a \"working church\", so there are usually services happening, which is lovely in itself. In a hurry? You can enter and take a 15 minute tour walking around the periphery. Have more time? There are endless nooks and crannies filled with art and religious statuary.Downside: (At least when we went and I have heard this is not uncommon) Tons of rude tourists, with their phones and cameras taking pictures with their flashes on, while the church attendants and priests attempt to stop them. It's dim and. . .cloistered. . .in the church, but many people apparently are not fans of available light photography. If you want to ascend to the tower, it can take an hour or more of waiting - try to find the best posssible time to go, which may be during the morning on a weekday. In the Fall or Spring (Paris in the Spring!). In the Summer, getting in to the Cathedral itself and, worse, the towers, can take quite a long time."

You are initially taken to a gift shop and are forced to wait there for five to ten minutes no doubt to splurge your tourist money on the thingamajigs they're hocking but once you finally get up to the Cathedral top its very lovely and although there aren't as many bells as there should be, they're still there, and the gargoyles also are quite lovely. Since the flow of people is controlled, it doesn't get overcrowded and you can find your own space to appreciate the place and take it all in. You are then taken to a higher roof top where the final treat is a spectacular view of Paris. It was jaw dropping gorgeous.highly recommended."

Expect a queue since a group is only allowed in about once every fifteen minutes. We were in line for an hour (it appears that about 25 people or so enter for each group). Once inside you climb a long spiral staircase typical of medieval towers, in this case with relatively few step outs for catching your breath. You first reach the belfry in what I think is the South tower, then you climb to the top of the opposite tower via another spiral staircase (shorter than the initial climb). You have about 5 minutes to circle around on the cat walk, with many, many nice views of Paris below, gefore descending a long spiral staircase that is the twin of the one you ascended initially. I'm a veteran tower climber (Bath, Yorkshire, Edinburgh, Cologne, etc) and this easily compares with those, but with better gargoyles :-)."

This is the one European attraction we saw that does NOT allow you to buy tickets to beat the line! We arrived around 10:20 and were beside the bells by 11:50am. I am a senior in good health & I was able to make this climb relatively easily although I did need rest breaks to catch my breath! We lucked out because just when we reached the bells they started ringing for over 10 minutes. It was incredibly moving. Then we climbed to the very top of the tower and the view of Paris was spectacular.... a highlight of our trip to Paris. I have heard it is a superior view than the Eiffel Tower. After we climbed down from the tower, we wandered through the Cathedral. There was no line-up & you could take as much time as you wanted."

It cost 8-10 Euro to enter the tower, which has its own separate line and entry point (if you stand in front of the cathedral, the tower line runs along the left side of the building). This was easily the highlight of our family trip to France. Climbing the tower stairs was a little like completing a long hike: tiring, but so worth it once you reach the top! Be warned, these stairs are very narrow, and there is no place to stop and take a breather. With people climbing single file both ahead and behind you, it's definitely a test of physical fitness! The views from the top are extraordinary. Looking for that perfect postcard shot to wow your friends? This. Is. It. The climb is broken up into three levels: an entry gift shop, a mid-level with awesome views (and an opportunity to see the famous bells of Notre Dame!), and finally, a climb to the very top of the tower, which made me almost giddy. Though the bell observation area was closed when we visited, hearing them ring while we stood high up on Notre Dame gave me chills. I cannot emphasize this enough: do not be afraid of that climb. It is so worth it.Read more: https://adventuringthegreatwidesomewhere.wordpress.com/2015/05/06/48-hours-in-paris-part-ii/"

The first 200 steps being you to the gift shop where you wait for the first tour group to depart the towers, then you are allowed to navigate the next 100+ steps to the first ledge to view a spectacular view of Paris. The group must wait here before climbing further up to the bell tower (or if one chooses - to exit, walk down). I did not see notices but please note - you must be in good shape and not afraid of heights to do this. Several people had to stop the catch their breath and there is little room to step aside and rest. The stairwell is spiral and contained. This is an excellent way to work off the delicious French pastries!"

After visiting the cathedral itself got myself into another long line not really knowing what i was getung myself into ... 387 narrow steps that i had to climb and not having the choice to go back down cause of all the people behind . So be careful once u pay and start going up there is no return ...lol but honestly once u make it to the top it's worth it and the view is splendid"

A visit to the TOWER'S OF NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL is a must if your visiting Paris.The cathedral itself look's magnificent viewed from street level but inside ,the cathedral will take your breath away.I know at \u20ac8.50c entrance fee,( reduced with Paris card) seem's a little expensive but the price pale's into insignificance with the beauty of the cathedral and the breathtaking view's of Paris from the tower's.Be aware ,there are nearly 400 step's up to it's highest point but the treck and effort are well worth it.The bell room is just superb,you can feel the history in here,the view's of the river are unsurpassed and if your a keen photogragher do not forget your camera,you will take some unbelievably good shot's.Up close the gargoyles look superb .This is a major tourist attraction so expect to queue and be prepared to wait ,the crowd's for this famous monument are huge.Very easy to locate ,just jump the metro to stop CIT\u00c9,you cannot miss the tower's.After our visit we normally go for a meal & drink in the lively Latin Quarter,another great area of Paris.The tower's are open ;Monday to Saturday,7.45am till 6.45pm.Sunday,7.45am till 7.30pm.A must go destination in Paris."

We had the opportunity this time in the evening when they are open until 11 pm (only certain nights). Although the line was long, it went faster than expected. The climb is long but there is a place to rest after the first 159 steps or so. When we got to the first lookout, at gargoyle level, I was dumbstruck by the sheer beauty and magnificence of the cathedral and the view. Seeing the structure and being able to touch history was inspiring. The Eiffel Tower was lit up in the distance, and you could see Sacre Coeur to the right. The city, in all of it's shimmering glory, spread out before us. It was truly awesome. The next climb takes you to the very top of the towers, where the view is equally wonderful. You see the cathedral from a vantage point that is not possible from the ground. I didn't want to come down, but as it was closing we had to.If you get the chance to climb the towers, don't pass it up. If you can do it at night, with the moonlight behind you, a warm breeze in your face, and the lights of Paris spread out before you, all the better. It's an experience that will live in your heart forever."

A member of the staff pulled us out of line and sent us to the front because we had a small child in a stroller. The gesture was welcome after subjecting our little one to the 3 hour queue at Versailles. Anyway, the hike up the stairs is long and steep but totally worth it if you are physically able. The views from the top were incredible. Seeing the interior of the bell tower was impressive. The top of the bell tower had some very tight squeezes. I'm not large but I commented to my husband that at 7 months pregnant, I would not have been able to squeeze through. So please be aware that the hike up is physically demanding and there are tight spots at the top."

This place is worth the queue, the money and the workout to get up there! I would not recommend it to people who can't climb up 3 stories of stairs, it is narrow and tough even for the fit!"

And it was very cool for the kids to see the gargoyles up close and personal. We also went into the small bell area. In the interest of keeping the lines moving, they do only allow you a few minutes up top but it was definitely enough to take in all the views and to get some wonderful pictures. We purchased skip the line tickets which paid off as we were able to get right up. So glad we did this as the lines were long, probably at least a 1 hour wait but we didn't have to wait at all."

Easy to find on the Ile De La Cite, it was about a 15 minute walk from our hotel near the Luxembourg gardens (you can also catch the metro to Cite or st michel-notre dame).Doesn't take a long time to visit if you've got a little time to fill, plus its free to enter the main areas (For a price you can also climb the towers). Be aware though that even though its free, its still controlled entry, so you have to line up. At 10am in early May we were fine, but at peak times the line can get a bit long. As one of the big landmarks of Paris, theres really no reason not to visit!"

Although it doesn't give you priority access or a separate queue, we still feel it is definitely worth a visit. This is our third Paris visit and we had not climbed the towers before. So glad we did now! We stopped by earlier on a Friday and the queue was very long so we decided to come back at a later time. On Fridays and Saturdays, they close at 11pm. We came back at 9pm on Friday and had a \"short\" 20 minute queue. Yes, we had to climb tons of stairs and I would question myself why was I doing this. However, once we reached the chimera level (with all the gargoyles), I was so glad to be here. What an awesome view of Paris! I have no words to describe it! We also climbed the tower to see the southern bells and then climbed up the southern tower all the way to the top. Amazing views of the entire city! Please be aware you need to climb hundreds of steps in a spiral, narrow staircase. We are so glad we were able to do this!"

But it was worth the hour wait! The view you get to see once you climb the stairs (there are no elevators, and the stairwell is very skinny so if you are claustrophobic, just be aware!) I have been wanting to climb towers but either time nor the company I went with during previous visits didn't allow the opportunity.) We had only one day to spend in Paris before we flew out and that was my ultimate goal. We loved it! It costs us 14 euros/person. My suggestion is get there before the doors open for the towers so you do not have to wait so long in line. We happened to be in Paris during one of the hotter days. Thank goodness there were vendors right across the street while we waited in line so we can get bottle waters while waiting ;) Another tip: as you exit, instead of going down to exit, go up the stairs to the very top tower.Definitely worth-while to do!!!"

We paid for a \"skip the line\" tour which provides you with a guide; a tour of Ile de la Cite; Notre Dame Cathedral and quick access to the Towers. It's worth the $$ in terms of not wasting time standing in line and the added information from the guide about Paris, Notre Dame and the towers. There are a lot of stone steps to climb in a narrow stairway; but everyone moves pretty slowly. However small children and people with mobility or breathing problems might want to skip it (there's no elevator). At the first level there is a gift shop (which you will not see on the way back down from the towers via a different staircase). Next level up has wonderful views of Paris; you can walk around the narrow parapets at your own pace and get close up views and pictures of the many Gargoyles and Chimera. I think this level has the most interesting panoramic views of the city and the widest assortment of stone creatures. Don't rush to get to the next (highest) level. That next level also has some very good,high 360 views of the city and some gargoyles. Then you descend, without stopping down a different staircase from the very top to the ground. There is also a stop partway up where you can visit the bell tower and see the large bells from close-up."

Note that many Trip Advisor contributors think they are reviewing the Cathedral, which is free to enter. The towers are a separate entrance. We were there the last week of June. The doors open at 10 AM. We watched the lines over several days and they always seemed too long. On our last morning in Paris (a Wednesday) we went at 10 AM, the line was already 200 yards/meters down the block. We waited 75 min to pay and enter. The access is very tightly controlled; once inside there is more waiting to be allowed to the first stage, which is where the gargoyles are seen up close, and nice views of the Seine, Eiffel Tower, Sacre Coeur. Then more waiting to be allowed to the top. We ran out of time and actually descended without getting to the top.My guess is that you should budget 2.5 hours to get in and get to the top in high season. Of course the view is utterly unique and that is why it's worth waiting, but the wait was terrible and so 4 stars, not 5."

You get up close and personal with gargoyles. You talk about The Hunchback of Notre Dame, (our 12 year old daughter knew all about Quasimodo from the Disney movie!, but Victor Hugo's original work is a wonderful read). And the views are just spectacular. But do be aware that there are 422 steps and going up is strenuous. You can pause along the way, and if you need to, do not let those behind you intimidate you. There are a few narrow landings where you can step aside and catch your breath. This is covered with your Museum Pass (you can buy online before you even leave on your vacation. The Pass is great for adults and not needed for children), but there is no quicker entry to the Tower. You wait in line with everyone else."

We've done this twice now and I think the view from Notre Dame is the best in Paris - better than the Eiffel tower or the Monteparnesse tower (but they are both great too). I like this view as it is right in town and not as high so what you can see is the beautiful city of Paris quite close to you. There are quite a few steps up and it is narrow in places so don't bother if you can't do stairs or walk well."

What can we say...the inside, you just need to budget at least an hour to go through it and read all the fascinating stuff.The outside, just take the tour and gaze in awe at the architecture. Get disgusted as the graffiti at the top. And wonder how the whole place stays up after all these years.Enjoy. Definitely a \"must do\" when in Paris.PS.

It is free unless you want to go up in the bell tower and I think it costs like 8 Euros/pp. The church is literally right outside a metro station (Sant Michel). There will be a line, but it moves really quickly. We were admitted in about 10 minutes. There is an audio guide which I thought was really helpful and allowed free access to some of the church's relics. For example, they say they have fibers from the cross Christ bore and also a nail. They also say they have the crown of thorns. There is a cool statue of Joan of Arc on the right and an interesting statue of a Saint holding Denis holding his severed head. If you want to go up to the bell tower, the line is around the corner on the left side of the church outside. They only let so many in so the wait time is longer. We waited about an hour, but there were little cafes and tourist shops across the street to pass the time. It was neat to see the bells. It is A LOT of walking up a narrow winding staircases, so if you are claustaphobic, this may not be for you. Overall, the church is a must do. I felt pretty safe though I am always aware of my belongings. It is also a stone's throw away from the Bridge of Locks (Pont des Arts). You can buy a lock (I am sure the vendor is making a killing!) or bring your own. Neat to see how many."

On the way up, we stopped fairly regularly at balconies or bell towers which either showed us gorgeous views of Paris or were steeped in history. The walking back down, however, was non-stop. Thankfully we're young so we could handle it, but we stayed at the back as there was an elderly lady who was struggling. They waited for us on the balcony bits, but I feel that perhaps the tour guide could've come back and checked on us as she was really shattered and could have probably used a sit or six on the way up."

Great views of gargoyles and chimaeras, which I absolutely adored. Be careful at one point.

Also the two aren't mutually exclusive and given most tourists will visit both monuments, just climb both! Queues are lengthy as there is a strict limit on the number of visitors walking the tower at any given time. Try and arrive at 9:30 at least to be out by 11. The climb is steep but hardly difficult (people of many ages and physical abilities visited with me). Entry at \u20ac8.5 is easily justified. One not to be missed."

The way I would describe this place is that for anyone who has doubts about God, this is a place that somehow is able to take away all doubts... during my visit there was a priest who stood in a ray of light shining down on him, I really felt like God was there with us and I felt an overwhelming rush of emotions that moved me to tears. What is really interesting was also the tour of the treasures, I felt a mix of emotions during that little tour. I was amazed by the beautiful works done by people in the past, but at the same time I also saw how much potential all the valuable had on changing real lives of our time.

Use the Cit\u00e9 Metro stop or Saint-Michel/ND RER C \"Yellow\" stop for shortest walk (less than 5 min). The line starts on the north side of the cathedral and is usually really long.For the bell tower, spend a little extra and do a group tour in order to skip the line. The entry line was over 2 hours; with our group we walked right to the entrance and went up. There are 387 tight, one-way, spiral steps to the top of the bell tower, no elevator. You don't have to go all the way up though. At around 300 steps, you come out at the top of the cathedral facade and can go back down different stairs, OR continue up to the bell tower top. We got great photos from the cathedral top and didn't go all the way up.I did see a few people crying & sitting down while being calmed; upset from either heights or claustrophobia. So if you are easily affected by either, don't go up."

I dis that first in 2001 and have come again another 4 times since. Be wary of the crowd as there are many pickpockets within this touristic place.

Visit to the tower is free with the Paris Museum Pass however no priority, i.e. have to wait in the queue just like all others without ticket.The queue is long because they only allow a group of \"xx\" number of people up to the towers at any one time; this is due to the tight access, limited walk space at the tower top. And they work on a \"one-way\" system going up and down of the tower.Patience is key but it's worth the wait because the view from the tower is amazing and get to go into the bell tower to see the bells.Honestly, prefer this elevated view (compared to Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe), personal preference.Going up the tower - 3 \"stops\", first \"stop\" is the ticket counter and souvenir shop. At this level, we waited for a few minutes before being allowed to climb to the next \"stop\" as a group. Next \"stop\" gets us to the elevated view - nice view and nice close-up with the gargoyles. 3rd and last \"stop\" after more flights of stair took us to one of the bell towers - still get some really good elevated view, and get to some glimpse of the bells.The tower is accessible by steps/staircase only.

It seems like a mad house when you go there because there are so many tourists that include massive tour groups. This can seem daunting because the lines are long and I have been here a couple times now, and it's not as bad as it appears. This is a church so there is no entrance fee or tickets to purchase. That means the line will move pretty quickly. Just strike up a conversation with others in line and hear about some other people's adventures. Great way to pass the time and you learn great things from other travelers. Be friendly and bold and you will be rewarded."

But to go there in person gives an impression far different than what you might expect. The church's exterior is really its highlight. The wonderful architecture and the marvelous statues that grace the walls are impressive. Inside, however, the church is massive and has many nice components, especially the stained glass wondows. But much of the church is badly showing both its age and its neglect. The climb to the top of the towers gives a nice view of Paris, but is hardly worth it, is very crowded, takes a long time, and does not provide an experience that justifies the effort."

While there make sure you don't miss climbing the few extra wooden steps to see the great bell (and imagine Quasimodo swinging around on it). Absolutely awesome experience - I just loved the opportunity to get up close and personal with the gargoyles. I would totally recommend the towers - provided you're fit enough to climb over 400 steps, not afraid of narrow spiral staircases and fairly slim as you need to fit through very narrow spaces on the top corners of the towers."

Seeing the Gargoyles up close and the various other features around the roof is amazing. The bells did chime while we were in the tower which is startlingly funny at first. I'm claustrophobic and had no issues in the narrow, tall, stone, spiral stairs because there are windows that let fresh air and light in as you ascend/descend. I would not advise climbing if you are pressed for time because the cathedral has staff on 2 of the upper levels and they control the volume. Plus, after that climb you want to take your time up there to drink it all in!"

There are A LOT of winding steps up, which gets more narrow the higher up you go. I'm talking over 400! It is well worth the climb up though, just take your time. Thankfully they limit the numbers of people up at a time, which explains the slow moving line. It costs 8,50 euro and is covered by the museum pass. You even get to go into one of the bell towers to see the bells! This to me was worth the climb! Make the climb, take a selfie with the most photographed gargoyle (who looks painfully bored with getting his picture taken), and then enjoy a cold beer across the street afterwards while you wait for your legs to stop shaking!!!"

After each level there is an option not to go up to the next level though so if you're finding it tough you're not stuck going up and up! I think its on the second or third level (not the very top) you see the Belfy which is really fun! Again, tiny narrow door, not disabled friendly or anything like that!!

It's really something when you walk through such a historic space and feel like the walls (and windows) are speaking! After a beautiful walkthrough of the cathedral, and actually observing a ceremony (in French)...it really was impressive. My two teens were in awe of it, and couldn't snap enough pictures of the glass and the entire space. You have to see this if you're in Paris, for the first time!"

During the day the line only gets longer as visits are tightly choreographed for reasons which will become obvious once you enter the very narrow and winding staircase. The stairs lead up to the north tower. Then there is a passageway to the belfry where Quasimodo worked. After that, there is a passage over to the south tower, which has another stairway up to the top. After a trip around the top of the south tower, there is a long winding stairway to the bottom. All along there are magnificient views across the city as well as overviews of the architecture and up-close experiences with the timbers holding the bells in place. In my opinion, the views are the best in Paris because one is literally in the center of the city where a stone in the cathedral's parvis or courtyard marks the point from which all distances in France were measured. The views are also great because they combine overviews of distant and nearby buildings and neighborhoods with up close looks at the distinctive gothic architecture and its gargoyle embellishments."

That figure normally wouldn't be an issue but because they let you in in groups of about 15 and it is a one in one out policy you can imagine how long you could be waiting. We got in about about 10.30am so not to bad. Once in you start the climb, which is broken up about half way through at the shop/ticket office. You stay here for a minute of two to get your tickets (if you've not be booked) then you carry up the tower. At the first observation level you can see for miles across Paris towards the Eiffel Tower and you can also see the Gargoyles and Chimera up close and personal. Further along is the Bell Tower, where you can see the bells, obviously. Then the last part is to the top of the tower for a 360 degree view of Paris. Time is limited to 5 minutes per group up here but that is ample to get your photos done. From here it is all downhill, a long way downhill though. All in all we were in and out within 40 minutes and probably would of been quicker had there not been a large school group in front of us. The building is just amazing and the views just as impressive. From my point of view i would much rather climb Notre-Dame than go to the top of the Eiffel Tower. If you do go here then you won't be disappointed."

You've been warned so don't complain if you go to the most visited city in the world in high season and have to wait to see everything lol!). It was the first Sunday of the month, and therefore it was free to go to the very top. It's always free to go into the church, but there is a fee to walk up. There was a long wait, of course since it was free, but we got some hot tea and coffee to keep us warm as we waited. Notre-Dame was the thing I wanted to see most in Paris and so we waited.It was of course worth the wait to save a bit of money and go all the way up. You get to stop at 2 different levels and you can stay as long as you want. It wasn't crowded (off season benefit) so we were able to take all of the pictures we wanted without other people getting in the way. At the top level you get to see Paris from 360 degrees and these will be your best pictures of Paris from above. You will have to climb all the way up (around 400 steps I think) so be prepared and also mindful of who might be in front of you if it's taking a while. There was one thing I did not enjoy about Notre-Dame and that was going inside to the actual Cathedral. They (not sure who exactly) put a souvenir shop right inside the church which bothered me a since I found they were taking away some of the importance and significance of the church. Sad to see that they were trying to make money off of a wonderful historical church. I'm sure tourists would buy souvenirs if they put it outside as well, but that's just their poor choice. It was of course beautiful inside and there was a lot to look at.Other than that, it was wonderful. There was a huge Christmas tree right in front of the cathedral since it was December, which really added a nice touch outside."

The point of a review is to read about the experience. The views are amazing, it's cool to see the church up close, all that. In my opinion, if you have to choose the Arc de Triomphe or Notre Dame, choose Notre Dame.Now, the actual experience - not the best. First off, the line can take kind of a while even if it's not very long because they limit how many people can go in at once, so it's best to get in line 15-30 mins before it opens in the morning. It seems like you're waiting in line to buy a ticket, but really you're waiting to have some guy do just about the most cursory and aloof check of your bag humanly possible. After that, you walk up a flight of stairs to what appears to be a gift shop...which it is, but it's also where you buy your tickets. No signs or anything telling you to do this. Once everyone in the group has bought tickets, you then can climb the tower. You get to stop at the first viewing platform, which seems like the end, but it's not. Again, zero signs or info. This is a one-way situation, where you then have to wait behind a Tensabarrier until you're allowed to climb all the way up. It's very unclear where the entrance on this platform is, but just keep walking until you can't anymore. From there, you climb to the top and you're only allowed 5 minutes - the snooty/kinda lazy employees will tell you this, but as I said, they're kinda lazy, so they don't really chase you down.So, climbing Notre Dame is a must-do experience in Paris, but you'll have to deal with a bit of rudeness. I guess they just get sick of dealing with tourists? But I dont' have much sympathy, since millions of people visit every year and they must be rolling in money. Honestly, most people we encountered in Paris were very nice and helpful, so these guys were not the norm. And not all of them were rude, but the ones who were soured our experience.*if you like my review, I hope you'll click the 'helpful' button; those of us who write reviews love to get them and it motivates us to do more :) *"

Also, it is better to go early in the morning!! During the day the queue is really long, and a lot of time is wasted....something you wouldn't like to do if you are only a couple of days in Paris. Make an effort, go early, and you will take a better advantage of the day!In the upper tower, there is a small balcony to appreciate the view. Up there it also gets a little bit crowded, specially because everybody tries to take panoramic pictures (which is totally understandable), and you get only 5 minutes in the upper external area (so everybody has the possibility of visiting). So...get early, be patient and enjoy the view.P.S. Go to the Square next to the Cathedral! It's super nice!"

We decided to hang back and observe, so as not to disturb those who had arrived on time. I am not Catholic, but even I was moved by the experience. On a more practical note: there was plenty of available seating if one wishes to attend Mass and it is worth a pilgrimage. As a point of interest we glimpsed artifacts from the past and viewed the archeological excavations in the lower part of the church.The cathedral is steeped in history, mystery, and glory.

They did not let people in until around 10 am, and by then the line was around the block. There is no elevator, so be prepared to climb a LOT of stairs. However, paying an admission fee, waiting in line, and climbing all the stairs the reward is definitely worth the trouble. The views of Paris are amazing from the top, and you also get to see the decorations on the cathedral up close. Gargoyles are very cool to see from the ground, but even better from the top of the tower! Also be prepared for lots of starts and stops on your climb and descent given the diverse ages of your fellow tourist, but be patient and enjoy the experience!"

The line was incredibly long for a very chilly damp day (it started sleet/snow by the end of the viist). But worth the wait. You will get a perspective on Paris like no other. You must be prepared for two things:1) The stairs are VERY steep, tight and winding on your way up. It was tough for some people.2) You are VERY high up when you step out on the first tower, and it was very windy when we visited. My occasional freak out on heights kicked in big time. I was happy and content to keep my back to the tower and take in the sights but I could not walk around much less make the traverse across to the other tower over open space (!) or climb up higher on the other tower. My family did and LOVED both the unique adventure and views.Another lady and I broke the rules and went down the \"up\" stairs even though it says not to. Sorry, but it was the only way. IF you have to do this, watch for when a next group comes up (they time them in small clusters which is why the line is so long) and then you will have a mostly clear stairway down (see my point #1 on why this is important)You can then meet your party outside of the other tower - exit is clearly marked."

If you are not into climbing numerous steps in only one direction, that being windy and up then this is definitely not something you should do. We braved it and pushed through and made it to the top. I am soo happy that we did this because the view was absolutely amazing. You could see the entire city and you can walk the whole way around the tower to see the city from every angle.

My third trip up these towers and while it was misty and we could see many of the Parisian landmarks it's always awesome to see the gargoyles so close up. The steps are challenging but just take your time they are not unmanageable and come in sections so time to rest in between. One thing I was shocked about was the lack of control of people going up and down the steps on the top and final tower. Usually they have staff to allow people up and down in turns to avoid two people meeting in the stairs which are very narrow and almost impossible to pass on. We were coming down when people were coming up and it was really dangerous as we had to pass on the inside (on the narrowest part of the staircase) meaning the steps were impossibly small and with wet and slippery marble also very dangerous. One slip would've meant a fall collecting all the people on the way down. Really poorly managed today - it was like a staff member had just disappeared off their duty??? Also the French security services have obviously increased security at the religious sites in Paris and there were heavily armed soldiers around the cathedral that I have not seen on previous (and recent) visits. This was also keeping the amount of beggars and annoyances down which was excellent. We saw none of the people asking for signatures on petitions that others were complaining about but if you do see them obviously walk on and don't engage at all - they are set ups for pick pockets and petty thefts."

After having seen it in person, I wanted to watch the whole movie again and compare the stained glass windows and the gargoyles perched on top of the towers from the actual. There was a long queue and I disliked the fact that you have to pay in order to go up the tower in order to see the breath-taking views of central Paris and the River Seine. We remained outside and watched as the huge Christmas tree was being set-up in front of the Cathedral in time for Christmas. So if you are keen to jump the line and fit enough to climb the steps (over 300 each) of the 2 towers, I suggest you join a tour. Notre-Dame is not just about the towers but also the stained glass windows, 10 ringing bells and the 13th century organ."

Instead, you should listen to my advice, get out of line, and go do something much more enjoyable with your time in Paris. You can always buy postcards with terrific pictures of those gargoyles and the view. This is one Paris experience that is not all it's cracked up to be, unless you are in very good shape and possibly related to Quasimodo...Several times a week, I walk by the line of people waiting to ascend the narrow, winding medieval stone staircase. Many of them have no idea what waits ahead - parents with very small children that will have to be carried up those 387 steps, people who have mobility issues, people with other health issues - and all of these patient people will have a great deal of difficulty managing the climb. Some people - the young, the mountain-climbers, the fortunate few - will be fine, though I never see many of them in line. They're probably off in the Himalayas, or someplace...The line is very long, and so is the wait - because only a certain number of people are allowed inside at any given time. Many stay a long time - taking selfies with the gargoyles and each other, some people need a lot of time to catch their breath, some actually enjoy the view - but all of them must descend before anyone waiting in line can go up. Some people even climb up into the bell tower - not advisable unless you really relish the idea of walking across a thin plank with only piles of pigeon guano to cushion a possible fall. Anyway, you have to wait till all these people decide to come down to Earth, too.What goes up must come down, and a similar set of 387 winding, medieval stone steps is waiting for you on the other side. It's not any easier, going down - especially if you have joint problems which have been aggravated on the upward climb, or have to carry a child who has simply had too much fun for one day...or not.I first climbed the Towers of Notre Dame when I was 40 years old and there was nobody in line. Even though I'm in much better shape, some 20-odd years later, and went up with a friend in September this year, I wouldn't attempt it again. Life is too short, Paris has much more to offer, and all of that can best be experienced without gasping for breath and limping for a week, afterwards.As I mentioned, you can buy photos, postcards, placemats, even statues of the gargoyles - all of which will look better than the photos most people take. There is a display of 3 beautiful bells in the rear garden, so you don't have to risk your life playing Quasimodo. Save your money, save a whole lot of time - go wandering the medieval streets around Notre Dame, instead of going horizontal. You'll have more fun, and when you're lots older, your knees will thank you."

While I recommend this to everyone, those that are claustrophobic might feel a bit uneasy as the stairs and some walkways are pretty tight (and everyone walks up single-file, so there isn't really room to \"pullover\" if you need a rest). Tips: arrive early because the queues are HUGE! If you need to use the restroom, those located outside ND (down the stairs) are free. There are con artists that will tell you that you need to pay (and they even have a crummy handwritten sign they use to block the turnstile) ~ just walk past and go in. The turnstiles have no coin slots and there is clearly marked signage that these WC's are free."

However - it was worth the wait! The views across Paris were breathtaking. And the gargoyles - wow! There are time restrictions that are loosely in place - you will be moved on from various areas mainly because the next group have been let in and will be climbing the steps of the Towers. However, we seemed to stay for longer than most and no-one bothered us. We are keen photographers, so the gargoyles coupled with the views meant we took our time.Thoroughly enjoyable. Not an experience to miss. We climbed the Eiffel Tower steps the day before\u2026but would still recommend the Notre Dame Towers in addition to this - if you love views, photography, art and Paris\u2026.do both! (Note - Queue for the Towers of Notre-Dame are around the side, opposite the cafe, not the main queue in the square. Old, uneven spiral steps to climb. Not difficult, but good to be aware of this if you have mobility difficulties. Also - your first stop is the ticket desk and shop area - if you want to purchase something, do it straight away as you don't return to the shop area before you leave.)"

The stone outsides and the beautiful stained glass inside. It is a sacred place. Go outside and wait in the line to climb the towers. We waited about an hour, and got to the line about 1 1/2 hours after it opened up. The climb is not difficult, but it is a lot of small, narrow stairs. You go up one set, and down another set, so thankfully there aren't people trying to go both ways on the same staircase. Once you get to the top, the view is beautiful! We had a very clear day, and the view was amazing. And the gargoyles! To be eye-to-eye with the gargoyles is an experience I will never forget. The bells started to ring for Mass while we were up there....it is very jarring! Very noisy, and if you hold onto the stone, you actually feel the vibration. The bells are on the same level as you are, so be prepared! There is a walkway all around the front of Notre Dame. At the bridge between the two towers you can turn around and see the back of the cathedral, equally impressive, and a view of statues, etc, that can't be seen from down on the ground. There is no timing, other than waiting on the line. Once you're up top, you can stay as long as you'd like, but it does get crowded up there. That is why the line is so long a wait; they only let 20 people up at one time, so the line lurches. But it was worth it~!"

You've seen the pictures before: a stone gargoyle sitting with his hands under his chin, pensively looking out over the city of Paris. If you take the Tower tour, you can enjoy his view and that of his numerous stone brethren who adorn and guard the two bell towers of Notre Dame Cathedral.The line will be long at this popular attraction, so I recommend going first thing in the morning on one of your sightseeing days (though I hear the evening sunset is particularly stunning from this vantage if you can work out the timing just right). Check the website for hours as they differ on some days. Despite the seemingly interminable line, my husband and I counted this attraction as one of our favorites in Paris. There are no elevators (of course), so be prepared to climb up (and eventually down) steep, winding stone stairs. Once at the top, you and the rest of the tourists who are let up in groups of a certain number will be free to walk and take pictures of the gargoyles and views. It is crowded up there, but people seem to behave congenially and take pictures for one another. You don't feel too rushed, but the ushers will keep you moving along at a steady pace, so that other visitors can take your place once you leave. There is no audio guide, you just relish in the grotesque beauty of the whimsical stone chimeras and the gorgeous view of Paris spreading out beneath you as you walk along the top of the Cathedral and around the towers. A must do in Paris!"

Firstly you should get to the tower before 10am to get in the lineup early.....because the way the climb works the line can be a slow process....what they do is let in approx. twenty people who climb the stairs part way to the souvenir shop/ticket booth room....after purchasing a ticket or showing your Paris Museum Pass you then go back out the door you used to enter this room and climb many more stairs to the top.....the climb is fairly tough but it is not what I would say to be aware of.....when our turn came in line to enter the Tower and we climbed the stairs to this souvenir/ticket room, we had a PMP in hand and directed to stand off to the side from the ticket booth where it would appear we would then continue to go through to climb further.... but after sometime of being jammed into this room a person in the ticket booth yelled at us in french asking us what we were doing.....all of us looked at him with uncertainty as the sign said this is where we were to be....he berated us and told us we should now be going back out the way we came and to continue our climb....no one in the group felt good of his attitude....now the fun part is that when you are corralled in this ticket room...the exit door is closed so that the group of 20 that was ahead of you and at the top of the Tower can now come down the stairs so that you then can go up the same stairs they came down and have your five minutes at the top.....the view and the awesomeness of the experience is worth the wait but it sure would help knowing their climbing system before hand and to train staff to realize that we don't know their shuffle climbing system before hand"

There are always queues at Notre Dame but don't be put off by the queue to climb the towers, it does take a while to go down as only so many people can be allowed up at once. The queue for the towers is down the side of the cathedral not at the front. There are almost 400 steps up a spiral staircase so you need to be reasonably fit but once at the top the panoramic views are excellent and well worth the climb. There are metal fences at the top which effectively cage you in so it gives an added feeling of security for anyone who is slightly worried about heights."

Even though a lot of brochure said that the Tower of Notre Dame closes at 6:00pm, on the day I visited the tower, they decided to close it earlier at 5:00pm and stopped letting tourists to get into the tower at 3:30pm. Because we couldn't understand a lot of the signs which were in French only, we lined up for the wrong queue and went into the cathedral accidentally. By the time we made it to the tower, it was 3:40pm and yes, the attendant kept yelling at me for getting frustrated of their last minute hour changes. As tourists, we only had limited time in Paris, I think the attendant needed to be more sympathetic to our frustrations. Other than that, we actually asked for help from another attendant earlier when we were looking for the entrance to the tower in the cathedral. We appreciate her help in helping us locate the entrance of the tower but I wish that she could have told me about the last minute change of hours. Then, we would have started lining up at the tower.Overall, I found the attendants at Notre-Dame very insensitive of the need of the tourists."

Instead, they showed a video (I suspect something that is available on You Tube) in which a group of French organists talk about the Notre Dame organ - in French. The video was displayed on some monitors scattered around the church and was also projected on a very inefficient screen across the nave.

We visited Notre Dame Cathedral in September and weren't exactly expecting the long queue we encountered when we got there before 10 am, in order to get to the tower. We ended up waiting for close to 90 minutes, which at first seemed like a waste of our precious time. It wasn't!The view that presented itself to us from the top was nothing short of spectacular!We then also realised that the system of letting only a limited number of people up at any one time, in effect leading to the long queue, has a good reason: It eliminates crowds at the top of the tower and allows visitors to have an unobstructed view over the whole of Paris, and without being jostled all the time.Anyone wanting to see the whole of Paris from above and from the very centre of the city, I can only recommend getting in the queue and climbing up the stairs. It is so worth it!"

There were already 30 some odd people present, but it was nice because the streets were not too busy, and you get a few minutes to enjoy the atmosphere. Be prepared to walk up tiny steps in a narrow and spiral staircase. Bring some good walking shoes and pants/shorts for the ladies if possible (seeing as you can be pretty tight with other visitors in the narrow/steep spiral case) The steps up to the top of the towers are a pretty good workout, but you are provided two short interim stops between. After the first flight of stairs is the organ room, where you get to rest a few minutes and they check your tickets and there is a few souvenirs that can be purchased. Next you continue the stair climb up, and get to the middle deck where you are next to the gargoyles and statues with a wonderful view of the city and the middle spiral tower with the green apostles - you can see the Eiffel tower in the distance, and also the Sacre-Coeur in the horizon. Great for photos. You next head up another rigorous flight of stairs to the top of the Notre-Dame tower, (the steps get more narrow at this point) and get a wonderful view of the city skyline. However, I much preferred the middle level view as you are next to the wonderful gargoyles which gives a wonderful perspective and reminds you of exactly where you are at while looking at the amazing city. When going into the cathedral, we were lucky that service was just starting. Therefore, we were able to see the progression of the priest to the alter and join in to the mass that was taking place. We stayed outside of the main pews (there is seating outside the mass area) so that we could leave shortly after without disturbing those attending the service. The rose windows are amazing - do make sure to also see saint-chapelle (close by) as well as those windows are also wonderful and different in their own right. Wonderfully clean outside as well, it was cleaned up recent years, so you can really appreciate the architecture. Must see and place to go on a trip to Paris. If you have a few minutes to spare, head over to next island to get some ice-cream (the chocolate is absolutely divine!) in the Rue Saint Louis en I'lle, there's a line up leading to a shop on this street."

Inside of course is wonderful too but you will have to queue. TIP: There are two queues - one for the main internal building and one to the left for the spire. If you can it is best to either do each area on separate days or have a break at one of the many cafe's around the area. We came back very early the next day to do the spire before it was too hot and the queues were too long. The views are spectacular. If you can only do one area i suggest the Spires. There are often concerts in the church - but friends have and say they are fantastic!"

So you may stand in line a long time not moving, then all of a sudden move up. Even once you get to one part of the towers, because the space is so small they do it in small groups. So you may wait and wait to get up, you'll get your fill of the views, and then have to wait some more to go all the way to the top. Still, totally worth it - great views of the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, even all the way to La Defense on a clear day, and get up close and personal with the gargoyles."

Whilst in Paris, my husband and I and our two children (age 9 and 7) did some serious workouts and visited and climbed the stairs of the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe and also the towers of Notre-Dame. The views from the Arc de Triomphe are amazing and much better than the Eiffel Tower - and the views from the Towers of Notre-Dame are even MORE breathtaking!!!!. I am so glad we climbed so many stairs of all 3 tourist attractions as each gave a great different perspective on the beautiful views of Paris! The only downside to this attraction is that we queued 1 hour 15 minutes to pay to go up the towers (there was a separate queue to enter the notre Dame itself - this was free) and all you did was go up the towers - you then had to re queue to enter the cathederal. Unfortunately we did not do this as it had had been a long day for the children. I really believe this is something that the staff at Notre-Dame should maybe look into. If you have paid to enter the attraction and already queued once, the could surely look at possibly giving you fast track enterance to view inside the Notre Dame ???"

Be warned, if you do not like tight spaces (or being stuck in them with a wall of people in front of you and behind you), just stick to the Cathedral and skip the tower."

We had dinner at a diner that literally had only about six places to sit. They served sandwiches and spirits. Was very nice although I could stand in the middle and touch both walls at the same time. In the front of that same restaurant was a place that sells crepes with nutella and other delectable toppings. There is also the warm wine served on the street. It is literally the best darned thing I ever had. I don't drink, but the boiled wine was not like drinking alcohol.Walk in the other direction and cross the Siene, there are hundreds of shops, restaurants, and bars. Be careful, they have employees in front of some of the restaurants trying to coax you inside. Its ok to politely say no thanks. They have just about any type of food you can think of from Kabobs to Pizza to Chinese food. You could spend an entire night down there. Its amazing, about an hour after dusk it gets quiet for about an hour (still crowds), but then the nightlife wave emerges. Amazing time."

Wear comfortable shoes as I found this to be a harder climb than the Eiffel Tower, When finished tour the church and be in awe looking at architecture that took 200 years to build.Don't forget to look for \"Point Zero\" while outside the entrance to the church and if you have a chance take a tour of the roman city below Notre Dame from the same court yard."

My daughter left to get us a chicken sandwich and a fresh chocolate crepe right across the street and we enjoyed our lunch while we waited in line. That helped pass the time. You do need to be in fairly good physical condition to make the climb because you move pretty quickly up the staircase. Once up top, the view is incredible! The gargoyles are fantastic! I never knew that they were all different (an eagle, elephant, penguin, lion, etc., as well as the ones that are typically pictured). You are so close you can touch some of them which is really cool! There's a pretty large section fenced off for visitors to walk around and take in the view. It can be a \"tight squeeze\" at some of the corners and the line stops at times, so depending on where you are, it may get uncomfortable for a few minutes. My favorite pictures of my trip to Paris are from the towers and this was my favorite activity of my trip there."

I must say it is so less up tight than the USA--when we were staying at her grandfather and mothers place in Angers - there was not even a frown that myself and girlfriend were sharing the same bed.

Unfortunately, they were doing repairs so we had to leave and come back. We had the museum pass, but there are no cuts for the museum pass. You can try like we saw many people do, but they'll send you to the end of the line. It only gets access to the top for free.The next day we stopped by around 2p and the line was twice as long as it was the morning before at 9:30.The next day it was raining and 4P. I took a chance that people would be discouraged because of the rain and time. The line was about the same as it was at 9:30 the morning before. I wanted to go up, so we waited 45 minutes. By far, this was the longest we waited for anything in Paris during our trip.I'm not sure there is any way of getting out of a 45+ minute wait. I think it would have to be a minimum based upon our experience and during the summer. Even if you get there at 9:15, the line is shorter, but you are still waiting the 45 minutes.It's a slow moving line because there is only one stair case (as far as I could tell). So they let about 40 people up, they look around and then the people at the top come down. Then the next 40 people go up. Once you get in the church you climb some stairs and get to a gift shop. Make sure you buy what you need (although there wasn't much time) because you don't come back through there.Then you start climbing the 387 steps. I had climbed the Eiffel Tower that morning (669 steps), Sacre Couer that afternoon (lots of steps) and then climbed these 387 steps. My legs were a little tired, but it wasn't a big deal. You can stop to rest if you want, but there isn't a lot of room and people are moving behind you. I don't have a problem with tight spaces, but I noticed it. It made me a little dizzy actually with all the steps in a spiral. You get to the top, but there isn't a lot of room. You basically walk along a pathway among the gargoyles. There isn't some big area to spread out like Arc de Triumph or Eiffel. You walk half the way, then you have to wait for the people who are already up there to go down the steps. Then you walk to the other side of the Cathedral, where you can see people to waiting to go into the cathedral. My husband who is scared of heights, was pretty terrified (more so than on Eiffel or Triumph). I was surprised, I wasn't that scared. Then you wait for your turn to go down. You are up top for about 20 minutes and then you have to come down.Seeing the Gargoyles and architecture up close was really worth it. Very Paris thing to see."

The line moved along slowly and we realized later that people had to go in groups and be synched, time wise, so everyone had the same amout of time at the various levels. We bought our Museum Pass on the first level which consisted of a little gift shop and a seating area. Once the stairwell was cleared we were allowed to go up to the next level. Here we saw the gargoyles and a great view of Paris. We had to wait for the stairwell to be cleared of the group coming down from above until it was our turn to go up. At the top, and you truly were at the top of the tower, you were protected by a cage and allowed to walk around. It was a tight squeeze up there with another group coming up behind us. Going down was pretty seamless. If you might be afraid of walking up 800 year old small steps or might be claustraphobic, this might not be for you. Great view of Paris."

By the time it opened the line went all the way down to the end of the cathedral. We were in the first group that went up that morning. We had the Paris Pass, but there is no line jumping privileges for this. You climb a bit, then you are in the gift shop/ticket office. I wish I would have known that you walk down a separate tower & the only chance you have to purchase anything is before you climb. It was a pretty good shop. We have climbed lots of lighthouses and I would say it is a tougher climb than those. Not many places to pull over and stop. I believe it was 400 steps. Since we were there early it wasn't hot inside the towers. Might be different later in the day. Once at the top you are well rewarded with an amazing view and close ups with the gargoyles. We were up top for about an hour and we got to hear the bells play. You can also climb up to a second higher level on one of the bell towers. They don't do a good job of letting people know to go up to the top of the one bell tower. We were headed down & would have missed it if it wasn't for a couple of teenagers yelling to their parents that they were going up. Well worth the wait. Probably one of my favorite things we did in Paris."

Worth the wait though. You climb up within one of the towers and end up on a walkway face to face with the amazing gargoyles. The view is amazing. Another climb takes you to the top of the south tower. If you have problems climbing stairs this tour is not for you"

I asked someone part way back in the line what time she had gotten there, and she said 9am, but there was no one in line, so they went to get an espresso. When they got back at 9:20, the line had a bunch of people in it :) Oops!I went back a few days later at 9:00am and was second in line, just holding a place for my adult kids (arriving at 9:45). I declined to go up since I had just climbed the stairs at the Arc de Triomphe the day before and my knee was rebelling a bit. Instead I went to a cafe directly across the street and had a Cafe Creme and a croissant while watching the tourist traffic headed to the Cathedral. (By the way, that little cafe was my only experience with a snobby French waiter, even though I used all the French niceties. I guess dealing with tourists all day every day was just too much for him LOL!)My kids loved the view and seeing the gargoyles. Be sure you get in the line on the side of the Cathedral, not the line in front that's for entrance to the Cathedral proper. Also, there's a sign that says that exact change is required, but my guess is that if you only have a 10 euro bill, they'll make change."

In fact, they have installed an ugly bleacher area in front of the Cathedral. There is usually a big long line on the north side entrance to get up to the top, but you can go in through the front doors to see the gorgeous stained glass windows. The entrance fee to the towers is 8.50 euro. The climb to the top isn't too hard (I think 387 steps up to each tower) and you can see the Emmanuel Bell which weighs 13 tons!

We waited for about half an hour without making much progress, and when it started to rain we left. We returned the following morning 20 minutes before opening and still, the line was down the block. It wasn't quite as long this time, but we did have to wait for nearly half an hour to get in.Once you're in, there's more waiting. We had to buy tickets and then start another line for our group to be admitted to the towers. The first level was amazing, with gargoyles in the foreground and an incredible view of the city in the background. We snapped pictures for about 15 minutes, and then there was more waiting until our group was admitted to the top tower. We were on the first level for 45 minutes and I actually started to get a little claustrophobic because we were stuck in a big crowd and couldn't leave.The time limit on the top level is 5 minutes, but by the time we finally got up there we were ready to leave anyway, so we snapped a few more pictures and then left.As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a ton of stairs, and they're all in small winding staircases. Coming down from the top tower all the way to bottom left us a little dizzy.Total time, from initially getting in line until we left, was about 2 hours. Tickets cost 8.50 euro, and we were able to pay with credit card. Entry time when we went was 10 am."

When we arrived, we made directly for the tower line, which is to the left side when you are facing the cathedral. There were maybe 50 people in front of us, and we had about 30 minutes until the 10:00 a.m. opening. They limit the number of visitors to around 10(?), and it seems takes forever to move forward. This is also because there is no real queue along the side of the cathedral, so many people were line-jumping ahead of us. (Beware bus-tour groups, because they have a habit of cutting in line, even if the location does not give them priority. It's just something they are able to do because of the sheer size of the groups. If you are an independent tourist, you will begin to loudly curse tour buses every time you see one approaching in Paris. They can completely ruin your visit and very often do.) Once you finally make it into the 10 or so people allowed inside, you then climb to the first level in a gift shop to buy your tickets, and then you wait again. Unfortunately, when you finally start up, the first person in line on the stairs will stop to take photos on every other step, and it will take you another 15 minutes or so to get to the top. Then, you will be behind the previous 50 or so people who went ahead of you who want to get the perfect photo of a gargoyle. You will have no choice but to wait until they are finished. The views, however, really are splendid. PLEASE NOTE: if you visit the cathedral towers in the morning, the sun will be from behind, throwing all of the gargoyles into deep shadow. So if you are one of the 2.5 billion people who must have the perfect Notre-Dame gargoyle photo, visit in the afternoon or evening. The light will be directly on them."

There is so much detail in everything and is a beautiful church on the inside. The crypt on the outside costs to go underground and see and in my opinion it was a waste of money so do not bother going in. Also, there are girls walking around asking you to sign a sheet of paper and donate to their cause for blind and deaf people. I gave a little change to one girl and the other who was asking my husband to sign acted very ride towards him when he told her he didn't have any money and that I had already given some to the other woman. All in all, it is more than likely that a first timer will always visit the church so go and enjoy it but watch out for the women asking you to sign something... Pretty sure it is a scam"

Many visitors may not realize it, but there are at least 3 lines on any given day to Notre Dame: 1.) a relatively short line to access the interior of the cathedral (free; from the West side of the church);2.) a much longer line (on the North side of the church) to access the towers (tickets purchased at end of line); 3.) an intermediate line to access the towers but for GROUPS ONLY - do not get in this line! As is always the case in Paris, it helps to confirm that you are in the right line (and that you are at the end of it, so you don't start a riot by trying to cut as happened to a German family who refused to budge until the booing grew loud enough - they left to widespread applause). Also: always make sure you carry something for the children to read or play during those long waits to maintain family sanity. The wait is worth it, and in many ways, the wait-to-view ratio is probably more favorable (and less expensive) than the Eiffel Tower. Be prepared to walk, climbing over 400 steps, but there are two levels, so you get to rest a bit, enjoying the first view, then climb all the way to the top to see the climax. The gargoyles are wild and great entertainment for kids tired of waiting. Some of the passageways are quite narrow, so heavier American visitors used to lots of space might feel both claustrophobic and acrophobic at the same time, but it's great exercise! The Paris Pass does not allow you to cut the line, unfortunately."

I'm reasonably fit and had spent four weeks prior climbing various towers through Europe; I found this a hard climb. Perhaps due to the number of people climbing behind, so the pressure to move fast, and there aren't places to rest on the way up. The view was beautiful and good to see Paris from that height, different from seeing it from all the way up the Eiffel Tower for instance. Loved seeing the gargoyles up close. Included on the Paris Museum Pass, but unlike other attractions you don't get in any faster with the pass."

Once you start, there is no way but up. If you have a Paris Museum Pass, it will cover the cost but it will not let you skip the very long line that builds up early. Only about 20 people are let in at any one time and you have to wait until the previous group is headed out the other side just to get in. The same line is where you wait to buy tickets which are bought at the first stop on the climb. We arrived shortly after it opened and waited about an hour and a half. All that being said, the views from the top are amazing. You can see in all directions and see every major landmark in Paris. You have ample time at the top to take lots of pictures and enjoy the phenomenal views. At the top, the area where you stand is narrow and it will be crowded with just your group. Some of the passageways get very narrow. You end at the very top of the right tower, far above the city. If you are up to it, I would not miss this opportunity. I felt it was more impressive and enjoyable than the Eiffel tower or the Arc de Triomphe but the other two have an elevator."

Be patient though, the view is spectacular and it's a great experience to see the gargoyles up close with the Paris skyline in the background.There are two levels you climb up to and if they decide it's particularly windy they'll close the top level so check before you get in line that both levels are open. Unfortunately it's the same cost and same wait in line even if the top is closed. Once they make the decision to close the top we noticed the decision often remained for the rest of the day even if the wind died down."

Fortunately we arrived early so the queue was only about 100m long, but it started to rain and wasn't a lot of fun. The view from the top was not exceptional compared with that from the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe. Our grandson enjoyed it but his knees are younger than ours, although he was disappointed that the bell couldn't be viewed as it was being renovated. Inside the cathedral was much better, and that was free!"

This time though, I decided to give in and waited in line. Entrance to the towers is on the left side of the cathedral (not to be mistaken with the entrance to the church itself, which is in front). As the sign states, about 20-25 people are admitted every 10 minutes. This is a pretty accurate description. I waited about 1 hour to be admitted.Once you are permitted inside the church, you must climb a flight of stairs to the kiosk where you pay. There is a small gift shop here as well. Once everyone in your \"group has paid\", you can climb the remaining stairs to the top.The spiral staircases are quite narrow and there are many stairs, so be prepared to walk!You have access to the landing between the two towers AND on the very top of the two towers.Views are great. Eiffel Tower and Sacre Coeur in view."

A great place for a picture PLUS it kind of takes you by surprise. Never expected extensive wood construction. The out on a walkway along the roof and...THE VIEWS! Gargoyles with the Eiffel Tower in the distance. The Seine River. Every tall cathedral in Paris. Yeah. If you go to Notre Dame and don't do the climb you are making a mistake.

The cathedral itself has individual nooks off to the side of the walking path where you can sit, pray, or light a candle. There was many displays inside explaining the past of this building and it is just one of those things you look in amazement once you realize people volunteered their lives to build this entire building. On faith and devout to their religion they built these beautiful architecturally designed buildings from ground up without compensation in most cases. It was just truly worth seeing."

            "review": "Cathedral quirkiness: notes and tips on visiting the Towers.. Anyone visiting the cathedral of Notre-Dame will want to carve out a trip to the towers in their itinerary. The entrance is located next to the north tower on the Rue du Cloitre-Notre-Dame; just look for the line of people and get behind the last one. Groups are led in about twenty at a time, and you are ushered up about a hundred stairs to an impressive but enclosed rib-vaulted room. As opposed to the fee-free cathedral, a visit to the towers will cost 8.50 Euro at the time of this writing and is paid at this point. After being allowed to browse the shop for a few minutes the group finally ascends to the lower ledge of the north tower.The Chimera gallery greets you at the top of the stairs and it\u2019s here where the fun begins. A 19th Century creation by Viollet-le-Duc, the group of mythical hybrid beasts, birds, and monsters are just plain cool to look at. There are some nice views to the west of the city as well. After appreciating the stone animals for a few minutes everyone is led to the south tower belfry to the cathedral\u2019s largest bell, then it\u2019s up another flight of stairs to the top of the south tower for panoramic views of the city. After about ten minutes up here it\u2019s about a 400-step descent to the ground and the completion of the visit.In summary, a visit here is worth the time and effort spent. From joining the waiting line to departure at the end was a little over an hour, although certainly longer in the peak season. The uniqueness of the carvings balances out the imposing \u201cGothic-ness\u201d of the cathedral itself and the views of the surroundings are on par with the Eiffel tower. I visited the towers for the first time in 2008 and it was a bit of a mess: a three hour wait, people crashing into each other on the top, a direct ascent with no break, etc. Whoever runs the show here really seems to have smoothed out the process and made it very tourist-friendly. This is all the more impressive when you realize this was done on what has to be one of the world\u2019s most visited attractions. Recommended highly and without reservation.Tips:*As this is a paid attraction with limited visitors attached to one of the world's most visited structures, timing your visit either during the day (get in line early) or seasonally (visit off-peak or shoulder) is key.*If you are visiting in the winter months be sure and dress for warmth. This was by far the coldest I felt in Paris during my four days.*There is a free green pamphlet at the entrance that functions as an excellent tour guide for the visit. This is highly recommended as there is no audio guide available and the attendants along the way function more as sentries and not docents."

Pity that queue problem can't be addressed I guess it's due to limited numbers. Plenty caf\u00e9s on street to visit whilst waiting in the queue for snacks etc."

Personally, I thought it was very cool and for me it was worth it, after seeing Notre Dame from the ground many times. You get to see the gargoyles up close; and you get to climb up to pretty much the very top of the cathedral! However, at certain times of year, the line for this tower tour may be very long; be sure you have a good estimate of how long the wait will be, before you start. If you get to ND early in the morning and the line is short: highly recommended."

The be able to get up close to the gargoyles and get some unbelievable photographs makes the climb up the tiny winding stairs worth the trip. So if you are of faint heart because of heights or in bad physical shape this might not be the site for you. However, if you can keep on climbing the stairs and have no worries about people complaining if you take awhile go on go it is worth the stops to catch your breath and let people pass you.

You get to wait on line for hours (unless you get there at 9am like we did), and then climb 400 steps in a very narrow medieval spiral staircase. My girlfriend was very tolerant! When you get to the top, you get (1).A fabulous view of Paris, and (2) a chance to study the wonderful gargoyles at very close range. In fact, the first one you see is the most famous, the Stryge (Vampire). These gargoyles are trememdously interesting. They were created by the restorer, architect Violet le Duc, from about 1840-1860. They were inspired by the impact of Hugo's Hunchback of Notre Dame (1831) -- except that in 1831, they were no gargoyles. They had all fallen off or been taken off to prevent them from falling. There is an absolutely fascinating book by Michael Camille called The Gargoyles of Notre Dame: The Monsters of Modernity. I realize not everyone has the time to read a book about just one sight in Paris. But if you did read the book,you would never regret it. And you would appreciate visiting the towers been more. An absolutely wonderful experience. We'll worth the wait and the climb. And there is a good patisserie right across from the line, so you won't suffer from malnutrition."

It is a historic Catholic cathedral on the eastern half of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 in the 4th arrondissement of Paris. Construction of cathedral began in the 12th century. It\u2019s one of the largest and most well-known church buildings in the world; one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. It\u2019s a designated world heritage site by UNESCO.Lines to Notre Dame are huge, but they also move pretty quickly. Entrance to the Cathedral itself is free. We paid 3 or 3.50 Euro each to see the Treasury of Notre Dame, which is inside of the Cathedral.Cathedral is beautiful inside and out. I prefer view of the cathedral from the banks of river Seine, not the Tower view that usually put on post cards. Beautiful gardens surround the cathedral. Don\u2019t miss climb to the Towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral. If you are facing cathedral with Towers in front of you, the line to the Towers will be to your left. This line is huge and much slower moving. They allow only 20 people to enter every 10 minutes. There is entrance fee: 8.50 Euro. It took us about 1.5 hours to get to ticket office (2nd floor). Stairs to the top are very narrow, 350 steps, spiral staircase (no lift), but view is definitely worth it. At first you will go to the outer gallery between Towers. Gargoyles and chimeras will surround you. Take another spiral staircase to the upper gallery. The gallery will provide magnificent views of Paris, the Seine, the bridges across the river, Eiffel Tower, etc. Beautiful! Highly recommend."

The first level was far more impressive than the very top we felt, but if you're going to do it you have to go all the way to the top.The stairs close at 5pm, so you cannot see the view of the night. So we found it best to get there at 10am when it was opening and beat the crowd, and get to listen to the bells being played whilst up there."

You have to stand in line at the north side of the building, where you buy your ticket (or show your museum pass), then are admitted to walk up a LOT of steps, only to find you have simply reached the gift shop. You are held at that level until the group ahead of you has cleared the top of the tower, then allowed to proceed up the stairs with your own group (about 25 people at a time). Once again, LOTS of stairs so not for the (literally) faint of heart. You can pause, but since there are not really any designated places for stopping, you are holding up the people behind you when you stop, so you can't linger too long. Then, just when you think your heart will explode from the strain, you emerge from the stairwell onto the gargoyle level, which is really neat. You get to stay there a while, then they herd you toward another stairway where you either descend, or proceed further up to the very top of the tower. But seeing the famed gargoyles up close and personal, combined with the magnificent view of all of Paris, makes it worth it (as well as just being able to say you did it!)."

Despite not being a morning person I loved being up early and seeing the city before all the tourists are around. On this day we arrived at the Towers at 9am and there was no line yet so we wandered right around Notre Dame taking gorgeous photos with no other people in them ( a rarity!). It was just lovely, quite a different atmosphere to the cathedral at that time. By the time we had strolled right around and taken lots of photos and gone to the toilet, there was a short line. We waited for about 30min and were in the 2nd group to go up (would have been in the first but they let a school group go in the first group).First you go up to a ticketing area which also has a gift shop. You dont get to revisit on the way down so if you want a quasimodo doll then buy it before they let you go up. The spiral staircase is tight and steep but not as bad as I was anticipating. The views are amazing. Right across Paris - it was fun to pick out landmarks and thanks to construction cranes at Les Halles we could pinpoint where we were staying as well. Gargoyles up close , touching the 850 year old stonework - this was definitely a highlight of our trip. Unfortunately the bellfry was closed so no seeing the bell but there is plenty else to look at - in every nook and cranny on the rooftops there is a gargoyle or a statue or a clock or a piece of scrollwork. It was amazing to see the Paris from above but there was also so much beauty on the towers themselves. Husband didn't enjoy the heights and he went down but I continued up to the next part where there is a time limit of 5 min and it is in a 'cage' - you can see a bit further and walk around to see out the other side but it's not got quite the same feeling as the lower down level. This was an absolute highlight of our trip - just amazing. Totally recommend. When we got to go up the line had stretched right down the street so when they say go early, they mean it. By the time we got back down to the bottom the area out the front of the cathedral was full of tourists and there was a queue to get into the cathedral, so again, if there is one thing you get up early for in Paris I would say it is this one."

Note Dame is different - very different.It is built on an island in the center of the Seine which was once the entire city of Paris, thus the name Ile de Cite. The cathedral itself rises grandly to huge heights fronted by two enormous towers. Less than dependable building techniques of the 13th century necessitated the famous \"flying buttresses\" along the side walls to support the massive structure. They worked - it's still here. Inside the massive cathedral there are all the trappings of an ancient and orderly progression of religious ritual which is still carried on today. A visit here is a \"don't miss\". The people handling has improved so the lines tend to be shorter and move faster than in previous years. Admission remains free but most people leave a small donation."

This is because only about 25 people are allowed into the steps of the towers at a time, and groups are given generous amounts of time up top for photo taking. So the line moves at snail's pace. We arrived at 9:15 AM for the 10 AM opening and were within the first 10 admitted on opening. That was great, significantly limiting our wait. I've heard that going near the end of the towers' opening period works well, too, but I am a bit skeptical re that claim. I recommend going before opening as we did. The climb itself isn't bad, as you can take your time and let others pass as necessary. And the payoff at two levels on the top, including the very top is huge, a vast vista over the western part of Paris. Well worth the time and effort!"

They cut off the line 30 minutes before closing.It is a climb up spiraling stairs, and many had to pull aside to catch their breath. The climb down, again spiraling stairs, also don't agree with some people. An intermediate level puts you on the level of the gargoyles, which were great to see close up. I took some pictures of the I will always treasure. Also some great views of Paris. If you are out of shape, this will be difficult for you. I think this would also be better later in the trip.

I didn't realize that September was still tourist season in Paris so the line to get to the top and even to get into the Cathedral is huge. I would suggest timing your visit to walk through the Cathedral about an hour before the towers open and then standing in line about a half hour before the gates open. The Cathedral opens its doors at 8 am and the towers open at 10. If you think you'll need more time inside the Cathedral obviously plan accordingly but I would highly recommend being one of the first groups in line for climbing to the tower. They only allow about 20 people in at a time to climb to the top and there are two platforms. If you are claustrophobic, or have health issues that would cause you to be easily winded or pass out, you may have a hard time with the stairs. They are tight and they are circular. The Bell tower section of the Cathedral is closed for the next year or so due to repairs.  The views from the top are some of the best in the city with the Eiffel Tower, Sacre Coure, the Seine, the louvre, and all of the left bank houses visible. When you stand back and look at the construction of this building it is awe inspiring and magnificent!"

Don't worry people are kind and tell each other how many steps are left. However, there are tiny \"corners\" where you can rest and catch your breath . I didn't feel any claustrophobic or anxiaty while I was climbing. There are windows that light the way up. Once you finish the first tower you arrive to the first viewpoint, where are several gargolyles. you can stay there some time, then you go to the next tower, and finish your way up.

When you consider the tremendous work and labor not to mention the ingenuity to create something like the bell-tower centuries ago, it truly enriches the experience. Especially since this view would be restricted to so few until recent history. We got in line early before it opened and waited...sadly the Paris Pass didn't let us skip the line, but at least the attraction was already paid for. Once the tower opened the line moved quickly so waiting for it to open was the right move - because it was REALLY long when we finished. The views of the Seine and the older parts of Paris are unparalleled. Also it rained the day we planned to go to the Eiffel Tower, so the climb to the top of the bell tower more than made up for not going to the top of the Eiffel."

The landings are enclosed in a wire cage (probably to prevent people and things from falling) and so photos have to be taken next to the wires. You are limited to 5 minutes on the upper landing, before following everyone down a second staircase. Not good for rainy days, no room for an umbrella to open, and would most likely be closed due risk of slipping on wet marble stairs. Best views of the city on sunny days!"

The entrance is located off the cathedral square, on 'Avenue du cloitre'. There are no elevators, and people with mobility, cardiac or breathing problems should reconsider. There are over 400 steps to the very top, all of them in a narrow, stone, corkscrew staircase. The staircase is so narrow in places, that one can't overtake the person in front, or that guards have to coordinate the crowds, so that a bunch climb up, while those at the top wait for the 'clear' signal to climb down. There is a break half-way, in a gallery where visitors can view Paris and see the gargoyles and chimeras. This to me, is the best part, the view is impressive (***) and will remind you of Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". Go, if only for this, and if you find yourself too winded, you can climb back down from there. If you want to climb fearlessly on, to the very top of the South Tower, there is an even narrower corkscrew staircase up, with the remaining 200 or so steps. The top affords an amazing view (***) of Paris, rivaled perhaps only by the Eiffel Tower. It consists of a gallery about 4 feet or a little over 1 meter wide that goes around the entire circumference of the bell tower. At the end, you line up, and wait for the guard's signal to go down. You eventually take a different staircase down the south Cathedral and exit at the south west corner. I have been there twice, and both times, I've profited from my jet-lag to get there early. The gates to the Towers open at 9 AM, and people were lining up along Avenue du Cloitre as early as 8:15. I can imagine the crush and confusion when hordes of tourists arrive and jostle with each other. I strongly recommend an early visit, which will allow you to relax and gaze on the city below, just like the gargoyles..."

First the gargoyles - actually more properly called chimeras and grotesques - the tower tour gets you up close to them for those classic photos. They are really nicely detailed and with paris at their (and your) feet, you won't find a better or more unusual view of Paris. There are no guides, but really it's all abut the view. The bad - the queue - but then it's worth the wait, and if you find an overcast day the queues won't be too bad. Indeed an overcast day is probably best for photos as you won't get overly bright highlights - although perhaps sunset photos might give a nicer light. And then there's the view - the second stage of the climb takes you to the top of the towers and you get wonderful views of Paris laid out before you. It's worth taking a long lens as well as a standard 24-70mm so you can pick out highlights. If there is a downside it is the cage-work - presumably to prevent suicides or vandalism - necessitating some reaching out with the camera for some shots. But with Paris staying largely clear of high-rise buildings, Notre Dame towers gets you a birds eye view."

The church is one of the few things in Paris open before 9 - we arrived at 8am, and walked right on in, no waiting (didn't realize until later in the day that there would be a cue at all!) We exited just before 9, and there were only a few people waiting in the line to climb the towers, so we thought we would go for walk while waiting. When we came back at 9:45, the line was down to the end of the street and around the block, so we decided to return a couple days later. This time we arrived at 9:15 and waited the 45 minutes until it opened. We were still almost 40 people down in the line. However, we got in really quickly. The first set of steps take you up to the gift shop. Then every 10 minutes they let a group from the gift shop start the climb to the first level. The climb was easier than expected. The view on the main level was extraordinary. I'd say the best in Paris. My husband did the second set of stairs to the very top. This set of stairs is the only to the top, so it alternates between people going up and people going down, so time is limited. You can view the bells from the main level most of the time, though they were being repaired during our visit. This is also the best place to check out the gargoyles, who are each very unique upon inspection. This is a MUST SEE for any trip to Paris."

We had tried a couple other times and found the lines too long. This time we got lucky and arrived after a sudden downpour which may have scattered the crowds. The lines are slow for a good reason - they limit the number of people in the tower at one time which means that you have more space to move around when you are on the tower, and it is possible to get some great photographs. They also stay open later on some summer nights which is great."

They can only take so many people up to the top at a time. It can be very cramped, so if you like personal space I don't recommend. I loved this, though, because I have always wanted my own pictures of gargoyles staring whimsically onto the Paris city sights, and now I have them. If you are a larger person, there are some tight spaces. My husband is 6' 2\" and fit, but he had to squeeze through a few tight quarters! You have to option to go to the first level or to the very top - since you're already up there, take the few extra stairs to see the very top. It will be a slow shuffle of a lot of bodies, but so worth it for the views!"

My husband and I had Paris Museum passes but we had to get our two boys tickets at that shop before entering the stairs to the next level of the towers.

There's no better reward for climbing an extremely narrow and uneven spiraling staircase than the amazing views of Paris from the top of the Notre Dame. The lines tend to get long around tourist season, but be patient - they allow groups to go up at a time and so once a group leaves the line moves pretty quickly. Keep in mind though that the staircase is extremely narrow and long so it does take a little bit of endurance to make it all the way up there.

We were about tenth in line and once the stairs opened, we still had to wait about 20 more minutes to enter because other school/tour groups were let in first. Once we were let in, we started the great climb! The stairs were wide at first, but then got a bit more narrow; I would not recommend this if you are particularly claustrophobic. About halfway up, you reached a small gift shop were you purchased your ticket (included in the Paris Museum Pass, free for those under 17 with ID, and 10 euros otherwise) and waited about five more minutes to continue to the top. By the end of the climb, I was a little tired but quickly recovered.The views were spectacular!!! When I went, it was a bit overcast but it was still magnificent! I really enjoyed that you were not only given an excellent view of the city, but also of the top parts of the Cathedral itself. There was plenty of time to take photos and enjoy the view before being given the option to continue to climb a little bit higher or go back down. The further climb was very easy and the views were excellent as well.When going down the spiral staircase, it was very hard not to get dizzy!

Only downside was that the bell tower was closed when we went and we missed mass (in English) by about 15 minutes. :(There was aline to get in but it moved quickly. The architecture was incredible. I was simply amazed at the size of the church itself. The detail outside was limitless. Inside the stain glass and the organ pipes were beautiful. i cannot even find the words to describe how incredibly wonderful this place was. I was simply in awe at the size and detail in everything that was here. I could of stayed here for the entire day. I think we were there for about 2 hours and we saw all that we could but you must simply just take in the beauty of it all to truly enjoy this magnificent building. By far the best church I have ever seen. "

I have made the climb many times in my 14 visits and one stint living in Paris, and I can't manage it any longer due to my claustrophobia. It gets VERY tight at the top of the many spiral stairs, and all I can think the whole time I'm up there is that I'll have to do it again to get down! But I am glad I saw those iconic statues and climbed all the way to the top of the towers for an incredible view of Paris, and I encourage all my students to go each time I bring a group.

The top of the Montparnasse Tower and the Eiffel Towers are great for counting square miles, but too high to see what's going on. The Arc de Triomphe has a great view of the Champs-'Elysees, but the ND Tower view is the best because it's high enough to see the city but low enough to see the people. AND it has those awesome gargoyles to frame your views or see up close. On June 5th (Wednesday) I got to the entrance 10 minutes before opening (10 daily) and waited 30 minutes. Later is worse until 430 or so. The early light is better for viewing & photos, so go before 10 AM. Next: If you don't want to take the final south tower climb, which does not add a whole lot, especially if you've looked down from Eifell or Montparnasse, there is NO WAIT to decend from the main viewpoint between the towers. Nobody seems to know this, but the waiting line is for the south tower only, and the guy holding the rope over the exit will let you by if you just point down."

PS: you only can see the bell after august."

This was my first visit to Paris and it was on my list of course!Upon arriving there were so many people but the line up went quickly to go inside this Cathedral.I took my pictures and before you know it I was outside again. To visit this you must and I do say Must go up to the towers to see the views. A bit of a wait but you know if this might be your only time then I suggest please wait. The line up is on the left hand side when you face Notre-Dame. I waiting at least 1 hour and again once inside after you pay you wait again in room. I think its because there are only a certain amount of people at a time going up the stairs to the outside views. Of course they are winding and you might get a bit dizzy so take your time.I was so excited to see the huge gargoyles and the views of couse . Don't miss the opportunity of a lifetime."

The Cathedral is really quite awesome and the details of the carvings and metal works on the cathedral are really quite out of the world. I joined a local walking tour while in Notre-Dame and the guide, a local Parisian, talked us through the little stories and myths of the Cathedral and even brought us through some of the alleys beside the Cathedral. The visit was both inspiring and humbling. Just beside Notre-Dame, the is a street with quite a number of shops selling souvenirs like scarfs, t-shirts, key chains etc. so you can squeeze in some shopping if necessary. There are also some little cafes that sells hot wine and crepes (with Nutella) out of the windows, interesting option for a quick lunch!"

            "review": "Not a cathedral person, but wow, what a view!. I am of the philosophy that if you have seen one gothic cathedral, you have seen them all. Even though Gothic architecture is to allow more light, I find them dark. But that is just me. It is beautiful and amazing the blood, sweat, tears and years that went into their construction given the time period. I do appreciate that. The angles, gargoyles and plays of light make for wonderful photo opportunities. I don't know if it was temporary or permanent, but there was a structure by the crypt entrance, a walkway and steps/seats in front of the cathedral that took away from the beauty of the outside of the cathedral. What makes this cathedral stand out for me though is the hike up 402 steps to the top of the bell tower. The entrance to the tower is on the left side of the cathedral. The line is long and it will take you an hour or so of standing. They take you up in groups. Get there early, they close at 4pm and close the line sometimes as early as 2:30 depending on how many people are waiting. You hike partially up (I did not count the steps) to an area when you buy your pass to the top. If you have the paris museum pass, you don't have to stop, however, this is a good opportunity to take a little breather before you head up higher. I had the museum pass, but I will admit I stood in line, pretending I needed to buy a ticket just to catch my breath. There are little landing area's every now and then as you hike up. I did take another couple minute breather at one of the landings, but it was not that bad. I imagine though if you have any problems walking up steps or do not do any aerobic exercise ever, this could be very difficult. Once you get to the top it opens up to a beautiful view of the city, all the way around. It can get crowded, but there will be plenty of time and opportunities for pictures, so just take your time and enjoy the view and take as many picutures as you can. It is amazing. There was a group of school children up there when we got there so it was a little more crowded for us, I think. Once we made our way around, there was a staff member that held us up before we could go down the steps, or so I thought. It was a little frustrating there as once you get to that point, you can't move and people were getting a bit too close for comfort and irrational thoughts start running through my mind. This thing has stood the test of time for over 700 years, been through multiple wars, but now I am thinking the weight of the 30 or so people standing there is going to bring it toppling down and we will all crash to our untimely deaths. Here I am safe and sound typing up my review so... no worries. The staff member opened the door for us to go down, or so I thought....nope, more steps up!! We were only on the bottom of the bell tower, you actually climb more steps and walk around the top of the right bell tower. Now I though the view was beautiful before... that was nothing compared to now. You actually are looking down on all the buildings. Simply amazing. It was a very nice sunny day and about 50 degrees. I imagine it can get cold, but it was nice when we were up there. You can see everything. It was a better view than the Eiffel tower, in my opinion. You can even see the locks sparkle on the Pont des Arts bridge, it looks like gold. I would highly recommend the hike to the top for those that can do it. It makes just another gothic cathedral a spectacular memory."

The line does move very slowly, but those with a Museum Pass can bypass the lines.Once you start the climb of 487 steps, the pace was slow and steady. You go up about 100 steps to the gift shop, where you buy your tickets if you don't already have them. Then you start your climb in earnest. It's not too bad, though. You stop at the first balcony and can walk most of the way around the church to enjoy views from all angles (until August, 2013, one side is closed for maintenance :( - too bad!) and take your pictures of the gargoyles up close and personal! There is an opportunity at this point to climb an additional staircase to the very top of the cathedral to catch some breathtaking views!."

The listed closing time is 5:30 I believe, but they started turning people away around 4 PM. They must have turned away 60+ people who wanted to climb the tower but were too late, so make sure this does not happen to you because you will be missing out on an incredible experience.Step 1. The Line. The line is long and no you cannot skip it, but it's worth it! Plus you can go pick up some food from the nearby vendors to make the wait go by quickly!Step 2. The Climb. Long and dizzying, perhaps skip this attraction if you tend to suffer from vertigo because it's a long and winding climb. Still, it's all part of the experience and I actually found the climb to be kind of fun and entertaining.Step 3. Showtime. You wait in line, you climb the stairs, and all the while you are hoping that it'll be worth it. Well, rest assured, it is worth it! To see the gargoyles up close, to see different angles of Notre Dame, and to see Paris sprawled out before you... it's just beautiful! The towers and gargoyles are obviously famous thanks to Victor Hugo (or Disney) and are worth the climb to see up close as it is, but when you add in an unparalleled view of Paris, climbing the Towers of Notre Dame becomes an absolute must! Being atop the towers, taking in the views with my fianc\u00e9e was one of my favorite moments in Paris. It was very, very special and I encourage everyone to climb the towers and take in Paris from this magnificent vantage point!"

So was kind of in a shock when I realised the circular stairway looks like its endless. There are 387 steps. No elevator whether you going up or coming down - so make sure you are fit. We queued for about an hour before we get in. Once you reach the top, the view is amazing. A little squeezy though as there were many people during out visit."

Notre Dame lives up to its legendary, iconic stature\u2014and there\u2019s no better way to feel like you are actually a part of the cathedral\u2019s legend than by taking the climb up its famous towers. Here, at the top of the cathedral towers, with Paris spread around the island in all directions, you can almost feel the pulse of the cathedral\u2019s heart and soul beneath your feet. It\u2019s easy to imagine the centuries of populations, architecture and history growing out from the very spot where you stand. The sense of history and spirit on top of the towers vastly surpasses the climb up any other Parisian monument (excluding the Eiffel Tower, of course). Not only will you have a stunning view of the city, but also access to the church\u2019s bells (think Quasimodo from HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME) and you will be able to pet the gargoyles that line the cathedral. The climb is not easy (402 steps), but if you do take the challenge, halfway up there is a convenient giftshop where you can catch your breath and buy a souvenir. The climb down has no such rest-stop. Just take your time and be careful on the stairs. TIP: The line to climb the Notre Dame Towers can get long during any and all seasons. Start lining up perhaps 10 minutes before the towers open, which will give you sufficient time to take pictures of the cathedral while in line and beat the crowds. Besides, the morning view from the towers is likely the best! Also, beware of gypsies since many aim to scam the line-up of tourists here."

After two days of stunning Autumn weather, the day had dawned with a thick fog shrouding the city. I had intended joining/starting the queue at 9am to get up there early but decided to wait to see if the fog lifted. I queued for around 45 minutes (while people kept pushing in to the queue...that is very annoying and something that happens everywhere!) I followed the instructions to have the correct change 8 E 50 (although when you finally get in there, you can get change from the cashier or even use a credit card!) The whole church is amazing, but taking the time to climb the towers is a must. The first flight of stairs is interesting, and then you pop out in to the foyer which is a stunning room with a soaring Gothic ceiling and huge paintings on the walls. This is where you buy your tickets and contains the gift shop. Buy something now if you want it, because you don't come back to this room. Then you are herded up the stairs. They get tighter and narrower as you near the top, but the walk and the claustrophobia is worth it for the VIEW! (having said that, it would not be good for someone who is large in size, very narrow passages. There is NO access for prams, buggy's or wheelchairs of any description). Paris is such a low-rise city and this view gives you a brilliant overview of the city. It is all one-way, and sadly I missed the east view. Be sure to turn left before heading west (towards the Eiffel Tower). I could have stayed here all day, but they do keep you moving and only allow each group 5 minutes at the summit. Definately a must-see, even for someone who has visited Paris many times. This was my 5th visit and the only time I have ever done this so I was very glad I finally did! If you only have 1 day in Paris, do this!"

The Towers of the Notre Dame Cathedral are a must see attraction when visiting Paris as the views of the city and the view of the Cathedrals \u201cbackside\u201d are spectacular. The line to climb the 400 plus step to the top are on the left side of the Cathedral if you are standing in front looking at the main entrance. We (my wife and another couple) got in line at about 9:30 AM, 30 minutes before it opened, and only had to wait a few minutes once the doors opened up. Our Paris Museum Pass allowed us to get in for free (but it does not allow you to skip the line).The walk up the small spiral staircase is a big workout but the awesome views make it worthwhile. It\u2019s a tough workout as there are not many places you can stop and rest and the folks behind you are right on your heels motivating you to keep going. My 74 year old in-laws decided to stay behind while we \u201cyoungsters\u201d made the climb. This was a good choice as they would have struggled. Since the stairway is a tight spiral you get a little dizzy climbing up and then back down.After climbing the stairs you are rewarded with a fantastic 360 degree view of Paris. In addition you get a close up view of the Cathedral\u2019s flying buttresses, cool Gargoyles, and the spires and roof. Each Gargoyle looked unique and I am not sure if any two are the same. Once on top you can enter a small door and see the giant bourdon bell (named Emmanuel). This bell is very interesting as it is massive. I was hoping someone would ring it while we were up there but that did not happen (don\u2019t miss seeing the bell). Once you get to the top you are led to an outdoor walking area where you can walk all around and see most of Paris. I felt perfectly safe on top as there is a railing and a high protective wire fence to keep you from falling off. The outdoor walking area is very narrow around some of the corners so if you are big boned you will have trouble getting through.The Towers are awesome and I highly recommend that you climb to the top if you are visiting Paris (but get in line before it opens or you will have to wait a long time)."

The spectacular views from the towers of Notre-Dame makes the hour's queue and hundreds of steps up the spiral staircases well worthwhile. While there make sure you don't miss climbing the few extra wooden steps to see the great bell (and imagine Quasimodo swinging around on it). Absolutely awesome experience - I just loved the opportunity to get up close and personal with the gargoyles. I would totally recommend the towers - provided you're fit enough to climb over 400 steps, not afraid of narrow spiral staircases and fairly slim as you need to fit through very narrow spaces on the top corners of the towers."

My boyfriend and i stood in the queue to climb the towers for over an hour, however, there was restaurants who sold take-away pasta dishes, so i ate that as we waited, which was delicious. As we were waiting there was a street performer who had a mask on that followed passers by, either scaring them or making them laugh. This was very enjoyable as it took your mind off the long wait, especially without a seat. As my boyfriend and i were under 25 at the time we got in with a discount which was fantastic. Only small groups can be taken at a time, for safety measures i would believe. At first you are taken to the gift shop, which you would think normally would be at the end. After a 5 minute wait you then head upstairs. The stairs are very small, narrow and can be a little uneasy as you are going round and around which can make you feel a little dizzy. As you get to the main middle part of the Notre Dame, it is an absolutely breath-taking view of Paris. To your right you can see the Sacre Couer, it was all very exciting. I did feel quite frightened though as you are so high up and there is so little space to move. If you are a large person you will NOT fit through the space you are supposed to walk to get to the other side. I was so surpirsed at how tiny it was and close to the edge. I was really happy standing in the middle as i got to stick my headphones in and listen to 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' soundtrack song, 'Out There' which made the trip up there worthwhile. You also get to see Belfry the bell and then you head up to the smaller towers. As i got to the top i felt it was too much, it was too small and high up that i couldn't go round it and stand, however the brief look of the views were fantastic. The trip down seemed quicker than going up, but again, continuously going down those stairs can make you dizzy so be careful.I would strongly recommend people who are afraid of heights, have vertigo and people who are on the larger side, DO NOT VISIT, otherwise, it is definitely something spectacular that you should visit in your lifetime."

If you can manage it, you will see quite a few gargoyles and can get some great shots of them and nearby architecture.

The line took considerably linger than it takes to watch the movie, but, admittedly, it was very cool. The gargoyles up close are really quite gruesome and suggest a lot about the beliefs in the middle ages. And I kept thinking about how we were standing atop what is a tall building today and must have been an enormous building -- indeed probably the tallest building in the world-- a thousand years ago. My son didn't see Quasimodo (he was apparently on holidays in Ibiza) but we had a great time anyway. Just try and figure out how to avoid that line.

From the platform between the two towers, you are extremely close to the gargoyles adorning the building which provides for fantastic photo opportunities. Back to the 387 steps... There are no lifts up or down so you have to be reasonably fit. Once you start, you can't really stop of turn back because it's mostly single file so others are probably following you. There were plenty of moans and groans from our group this morning. The majority of the climb is enclosed inside the tower with minimal windows, so you can feel a little closed in before you reach the top. This experience isn't for everyone, however if you choose to do it, you're rewarded with magical views. Tip: Pre-purchase your ticket so you don't have to line up. The queue for tickets this morning was 20 mins and it wasn't really that busy."

Once you get in, you can see why the wait is so long. There are about 400 stairs, and in some places are very narrow, which means it's one way traffic only (hence the very long queue). I would definitely recommend this. Like many things in France, it's free for EU citizens. I think it's around 10 euro for others. If you're mobility challenged, very unfit or claustrophobic, this might be a very difficult activity as there are no breaks for the 400 stairs, you just need to keep going up and often it's too narrow for others to overtake you. Amazing veiws from the top."

This particular mass (when we were there) was packed with tourists, like ourselves, attending the mass while others were walking around looking at the cathedral. The priest used a GREAT DEAL of incense---so, if incense bothers you, don't go. We were sitting in the back and the incense still bothered my husband. Due to the number of people during mass, the church was warm, which made it uncomfortable. I would go to mass at Notre a Dame again---my husband would not.

I would recommend since using the audio guide at other locations revealed some fun and interesting facts. Architecture and history of the building are really something to behold. Wanted to climb the 300+ steps to the towers, but line was too long.. Girls in the park next to the river wanted signatures and money for some scam. Wave them away and enjoy a quick break from the crowds in front of the cathedral.. Captured a great view of the building from the back side via river boat tour. Cross the bridge for souvenir shops and food."

This attraction opens at 10am, but you will need to get in line no later than 9am to avoid a huge line. Line forms on the north side of the cathedral. Enjoy a coffee and some conversation with fellow tourists while you wait, you will be glad you got there early as you look behind you and see the line! Access to this feature is 10 euros.This is a fairly strenuous climb. Only attempt if you can climb about 15 flights of stairs continuously. It is a winding and narrow staircase. First climb takes you to a balcony of sorts between the towers. At this point, you have the option of continuing to climb to the top of the south tower for the ultimate views. Catch your breath here, marvel at the architecture, and then continue to the top. It's worth it."

I think this is the most visited and famous church in the world not only because of its wonderful architecture but also for the fame that Victor Hugo gave to this church. Esmeralda and CasimodoI should add one important thing : There are two queues for the church : one for climbing to the top of the church with the narrow staircase ( approximately 385 steps) by which you can watch Paris under your foot . The entrance fee is about 10 Euros but it is worth trying it.2) Another line/queue to the main entrance ( inside the church ) is free but long. You can see the Gothic architecture with the statues of the bishops and ....Also, you can find a beautiful scene covered with many pigeons around you in front of the big statue of Charlemagne . Your little children would enjoy feeding the pigeons.Do not hesitate about my advice and come to visit this beautiful church and Seine River beside it."

I was able to be in the first group this way. They only let a certain amount of people (~20 ish) up at a time, so if you're not part of the first couple of groups, it may take a while. I loved seeing the gargoyles and the views are great. There's a resting point in the giftshop - buy whatever you want at this point because you don't come down the same way. If you have concerns about being slow up the stairs, just make sure you're at the end of the group after the giftshop stop...there's less pressure to move quickly up the stairs this way."

It's very beautiful but very grueling as you feel like you must keep up with the group and there isn't much space for people to pass. The line was very long, we went around 10am and had to wait about an hour. You first walk up a bunch of stairs where you can than purchase your ticket, than you walk up more stairs and are on the flat part in the middle. It has great views of the Eiffel Tower and that view of Paris. You can also see gargoyles up close which is really cool. You can also go up in a bell tower and see one of the bells and take your picture with it. Than you move up to the very top of the towers where you get a 360 degree view of the city. Please note, you're doing all this as a group, you can't wander on your own very much and it's limited time. Very cool and I loved it I would suggest you see it. The tower line is on the left of the cathedral if you're looking at the front."

The key things with this are: they only let 20 people in at a time at about 15min intervals. The initial climb is hard work and this is to the ticket office. Once you have paid we found that we were not given any instructions on where to go next and found that we were waiting in the shop area for a good 10mins before we found out where we had to go next. Recommended for the view and the experience of being on the Notre Dame but be warned that if you have issues with lungs/heart etc that this is not recommended."

Since this attraction is entitled the \"Tours\" of Notre Dame, I'm assuming it's supposed to cover the Tower climb activity, which is seperate from the entry to the cathedral itself (and the tower climb is not free, though it is covered by the Paris Museum Pass).Queue up for the tower at the northwest corner -- or rather, at the line that starts at that point. The queue usually seemed to stretch for much of the length of the cathedral itself along its north side. But no problem: it tended to move quickly, as visitors were admitted periodically in groups of 25.The tower climb is in three stages along spiral staircases: first to a giftshop, then after a short wait, up to the gallery at the level of the bells. The bell room can be accessed via very small entryways from the gallery; note there the huge, ancient wooden beams.It's here on the gallery where one gets the closest look at the iconic Notre Dame gargoyles. it's a bit of trick trying to shoot through the fine netting that's been erected -- I wonder if it was added because folks had been losing their phones while holding them out over the edge while taking photos...?In places, the gallery is a bit of a tight squeeze, but in every direction it provides wonderful views over the city: from the front (toward the west) is the best. There one can see the Eiffel Tower and to the right of it, the L'Defense complex, and below, the long line of folks waiting to enter the cathedral proper.Then it's up another tighter staircase to the very top of the south tower. Here I found the best view of Mont Martre, which lies to the north by west.In summary, the tour climb might not be for the weak or those with no head for heights, but for anyone else, with much exertion comes much reward."

From my understanding there were two lines, one for those who had booked tours, that wrapped around the building and were at least 150 people deep, and then there was a second line to purchase tickets, that went out into the square, and wrapped around itself a few times, making it impossible to count how many people were in line. So instead we settled for walking around the Cathedral, and just standing in awe of the amazing architecture. I regret not deciding to do a tour of the Notre Dame Cathedral and booking in advance, but at the very least it is a very worthwhile walk to and around."

When we entered, it was not too crowded, but very crowded as the morning progressed.There was a mass going on, but tourists were allowed in the area surrounding the main sanctuary (church). The mass was beautiful as was th music, but not for anyone easily distracted by crowds. There was security outside the church grounds given the new heightened awareness in Paris. The beauty of the church is breathtaking and the windows live up to expectation. Outside, the view with the towers is very impressive. There is a new shrine outside to Pope John Paul II on the grounds. If one just wants to observe the architecture, the large plaza (shown in this picture) makes that possible. There are tourist shops about 200 feet to the left of this plaza so you can plan to buy reasonably priced souvenirs during the trip. I believe that there is a small shop inside the church as well for religious articles."

Get there at least a half hour before they open up the steps (which is later than when the church interior opens. This is the only line we spent a good deal of time in - an hour. Here is my advice. Buy the museum pass! Go early and enjoy the interior of Notre Dame before they open the climb. Download Rick Steves app and walking tour (you can listen to it through earbuds offline.) If you are not traveling alone, go immediately to the line to make the climb and then you can take turns taking a bathroom break (look behind the sculpture of Charlemagne - it will cost 80 cents.)"

The entrance gate is the security gate they only allow about 20 people in at a time. They opened at 10:00 am and we entered at about 10:45. We got into line at about 9:30. There are cafes right across the street so you can get a cup of coffee and croissant while you wait. Once in you enter a gift shop where you buy your entry ticket. After everyone has purchased tickets you will be allowed up the stairs. Once there you can wind around the pathway and into the bell tower. Then as you wind around to exit (prepare to wait) the line queues up to enter an upper tower. Once you go to the upper tower you then proceed down the stairs to street level. While at the top we heard the bells chime which was quite extraordinary."

We were second in line, by 9:20 you couldn't see the end of the line behind us. After you climb about 20 steps, you enter a gift shop where you purchase your admission ticket. At this point, it is HIGHLY recommended that you purchase a Paris museum pass. It will cover not only your admission to the tower climb, but most all of the other museums you will want to see in Paris. Second, you must be in fairly good physical condition to do this climb without undue effort. There are 423 (or so) steps to the top of the tower. You climb about 3/4 of the way up then stop at a walkway between the two towers. At this point, you can either continue on up to the top of one tower or go back down. The climb from there on up is steep and windy, a person of size would have a fair amount of difficulty making this climb comfortably. Also, once you start up, you must continue on to the point of the walkway between the towers. Now, once you are up, the views are magnificent! It is definitely worth the effort. Once you come down, you can go inside and see the beautiful cathedral itself."

At night, it is even more stunning. If you did plan to visit inside and climb the stairs, go around the time of sunset because the skies are fabulous.

The climb up is through a narrow circular staircase (approx. 8 stories high) and can be quite taxing if you're not physically fit. Once you're at the top, the space is very narrow, but the view of Paris is quite amazing. I imagine it could get uncomfortable at the top if there is a crowd."

There are approximately 387 narrow steps to get to the top. When you get to the top, the space is very narrow and its extremely crowded. There is a net all around for safety. If you're looking for a good view of Paris, nothing beats the Arc de Triomphe. The gargoyles were cool and that was pretty much it.Tip #1- Carry a water bottle when climbing the steps.Tip #2- Skip the bell towers all together and see the inside of the Notre Dame Cathedral (free of charge).

Recommend getting in line at least 1/2 hour before opening to minimize the wait (you can grab food/water right across the street), or book a skip-the-line tour. Museum pass DOES NOT allow you to skip the line. Lots of stairs, so wear walking shoes. Best to do this on a clear day, as the views of the Paris skyline are a big part of the experience, in my opinion. You see some neat areas, including close-ups of statues and the famous gargoyles, plus you can get right under the tower bells, which is pretty neat too. Think about how this cathedral was constructed without modern tools while you walk around - quite a feat!"

The history that he tells you is amazing and certainly makes your visit special. You watch other people just wandering thru and think they really are missing out. The Crown of Thorns are in the Cathedral and most people pass them by. We wouldn't have seen them except for our guide pointing them out. You really need the skip the line tower ticket or you could be waiting hours. The guide takes you up into the shop and then you are free to continue up all the stairs to the top. There is no lift. Nearly 400 stairs up and then back down. But it's worth it. The view is spectacular. This tour is a MUST DO."

The queues for visiting the towers tend to be long as are the waiting times. I finally gave in and decided to see what it's all about. In my opinion, it's not worth the wait. Not much to see except a relatively decent view of central Paris from above. But, you will get a better view if you go either to Montmartre or take the escalators up to the top of the Centre Pompidou (both of these are free)."

By then, the line was really long, and the very top of the towers allows only a very few people at a time, so it goes slowly. The climb is arduous, so be ready for it. But once at the first level, the views are spectacular! Gargoyles and other creatures are your companions while viewing the sights of Paris from above.The bell tower evokes images of Quasimodo. The view from the very top provides even more vistas."

Also taking pictures from the other side of the Seine River makes for a great photo too.We did a quick tour of the inside which we were very impressed by. We did not go up the tower, because by that time there was a long line. We visited on a Saturday morning and there was a wonderful, massive tent sent up in the front of the cathedral that was selling fresh baked pastries. The smell was fantastic and you couldn't help but go in a buy a croissant or baguette, then sit on a bench eating the fresh baked goods and admire the cathedral. Great experience."

You enter at the side, not the main entrance. You do not pay for entry to Notre Dame but you pay for entry to the towers. There are a lot and lots of steps. There is a rest point on the 1st floor at the gift shop but the steps to this point aren't too bad. The next set of steps are a little steeper with one doorway about half way up that 1 or 2 people could stop to rest in if required. Your next stop leads to the bell towers and has some beautiful views. There is an area with two bells, which have an open wooden staircase but it is only a short distance. All other stairs are stone and enclosed. Once viewing the bells, which is optional, you then have the choice to exit or go to the top. You have to queue as numbers are restricted at any one time on the top level. The staff control this. If you want to exit go up to the rope and let the staff know, so you aren't stuck in the queue. The stairs to the top floor are very winding and steep with no rest point. I wouldn't be very fit and I managed it, my legs did feel like jelly for around an hour after. I wouldn't recommend for anyone with fear of heights or mobility issues. You are surrounded by safety fences. Some of the turns around the corners are quite tight but perfectly safe. Don't forget, once you get to the top, you then have to go all the way back down."

They let in about 20 people every 15 mins... so do the maths of how long you might wait.... long !- For people who are scared of heights, this one is suitable as there is a high rampart and fence all along the outside areas... and the snail staircase has a middle-filled post.- You might have an unpleasant surprise close to the opening though. as the access to the bell tower and roof are weather-permitting. If it's too windy (not street-level wind conditions), these areas are closed. The issue is that, contrary to the church itself, personnel of the towers don't install fences nor boards with daily info until about 9:50... so you might have waited for a while and still not have access to it all. This is really something they should improve on.- There are NO options to buy tickets ahead of time"

The first time, we went a lot earlier in the day and only waited for about 40 minutes. The second time, we went around the middle of the day and waited for about 2 and half hours. It is my all time favorite view of Paris because you can see all of the monuments, including the Eiffel Tower, and the gargoyles are very cool. I would definitely recommend going earlier or later when the line is not as long because it ends up taking up a lot of your day if you are waiting in line for hours. Once you get in, there is a ticket booth to buy tickets to go to the top, we got in free as students with a visa from Italy. It is not actually that bad of a climb and the view is worth the money and time (maybe not 2 and a half hours, but definitely an hour or less)."

The views are absolutely astounding. Look at the bell tower and up the south tower,just be prepared to wait to make the descent from the south tower....there is only one narrow stairwell that serves going up and down.

It is a climb and if you have health issues climbing stairs then this is not for you. Once you reach the top, the view and architecture is stunning! Plenty of opportunities to take pictures/selfies/etc. They have fence like barriers so no one can fall off, but there are parts cut out for a good photo.Here is the strange part, if you want souvenirs, buy them when getting the tickets.

I can recommend the skip the line options offered by a number of companies as this probably saved us several hours of time. It might cost a bit more but a competent tour guide speaking your own language makes the experience so much better. If you are physically able to climb tight circular stairs then adding this option into your tour will is a great bonus. I think it's 420 up and the same down. I loved getting up close to the gargoyles and the views over the city were really good.While we were enjoying the view the bells rang out really loudly, what an experience! They only let limited numbers climb at a time so its not too crowded. There are limited catch your breath spots during the climb but we did find a couple of chairs outside the bells.The morning we visited 5 May 2016 they had a full mass so there was a lot of atmosphere inside the church as well.Recommend this as a must do attraction."

Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris (\u5df4\u9ece\u8056\u6bcd\u9662, \"Our Lady of Paris\u201d) is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the eastern part of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 (\u897f\u5824\u5cf6) in the fourth arrondissement of Paris, France. The Notre-Dame Cathedral celebrated its 850th anniversary of laying the first building block for the cathedral on December 12, 2012. The North Tower on top of Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame was completed in 1240 and the South Tower in 1250.  We tried to visit the towers after we visited the Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris. We arrived around 5 pm, but it was too late although the official time of the visit is 10 am to 6:30 pm in April. We tried again next morning before 10 am, but there already had 20 people in the line. After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were able to start our journey to the top of Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame. It was a narrow 387-step (69 m / 226 ft) climb up the spiral staircase. The first stop was the upper room of the North Tower where the ticket counter and souvenir shop were located. We also noticed an elegant small spiral staircase inside the upper room. We continued the climb to the Chimera gallery after a short rest. You can see not only the magnificent views over Paris, but also lots of strange beasts known in French as \u2018Les Chim\u00e8res\u2018 that are located here. Those Chimera creatures looked like birds or monsters were looking down to the city, observing all the people in Paris for several hundred years. We could even see the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur from a distance. This was not the end of the tour -- we continued our climb to the top of South Tower. There were many gargoyles on top of the North and South Towers. These decorated waterspouts were designed to deliver water from the roof and keep the water away from the cathedral. On the top of cathedral, we saw all the famous landmarks and enjoyed a 360 degree view of Paris. Don\u2019t miss the opportunity to go inside the small wooden door. Behind the door is the famous, oldest and largest 13,271 kg (29,258 lb) Emmanuel bell, which has been a part of the building since 1681.  One thing I could not believe was there were so many smokers in Paris. They smoke even when they are walking. When we queued up at the entrance of the Tower Tour, they smoke regardless non-smokers and children. The French advocate freedom, but they should also respect others. The entrance for the visit of the tower is located outside of the cathedral on the left-hand side of the fa\u00e7ade, on Rue du Clo\u00eetre Notre-Dame. It costs \u20ac8.5 for an adult."

As you enter there is a feeling of historic presence of being. The architects again have kept this style of Gothic artistry ( which I do love ). The height of this building shocked me somewhat as i expected it to be smaller ( viewing the top from the other side of the Seine ) The doorway is covered in sculptures too many to list. Inside is what you would expect in d\u00e9cor of such a truly magnificent piece of art. Another very moving visit for me emotionally. We came here for our honeymoon a few years ago and wasn't disappointed."

Walking inside the cathedral takes you back in time. The long history of the church is outlined in intricate marble sculptures that force you to think, how did they do that? The grandiose stain glass windows illuminate the church spectacularly. That being said, the real treat is going up into the cathedral bell towers. Although the nearly 250 steps is going to be a bit much for some, the payoff is well worth it if you can do it. Personally, I don't think you can claim you where in Paris unless you do this. We loved going to the top of the Eiffel but it didn't compare to the cathedral towers IMHO. It's at the top that you get to witness Paris through the eyes of the gargoyles. It's a spectacular view. Tip: get there early and if you can swing it, pay for one of the \"skip the line\" tours available as the lines are long. If you can't, I would strongly encourage you to wait in line(separate from the line to get inside the church itself). The towers compare closely with walking up in to the dome at St Peters Basilica in Rome. It too is a tremendous and exhausting hike up many many stairs but one of the things we've done that we still talk about many years later. We will be discussing our morning at the Cathedral Towers for many years to come too."

When you enter, you are aware of how grandiose this space is, but it is quite dark. It's a little difficult to see some of the great aspects of this cathedral. I would also recommend going up the towers if you're up for climbing many stairs. Seeing those famous gargoyles up close is a fun experience. So, go see Notre Dame. see it from all the sides, hang out in the park behind it (there's free wifi too!), just be aware that you will be in that line for ages and that you mostly just make a loop around the inside and then leave."

Make sure you are aware of this and wear comfortable shoes, and maybe bring a book.Once past the queue you must pass through a security check, you need to open your bag to allow the guard to check inside.You then begin to climb the stairs..... this is not for the faint heart and there is no other option but the stairs. You have been warned.Taken to a shop and ticket office, if you want anything, buy now as you won't get the chance to go back. Take this opportunity to get ready for more and more stairs.Once at the top you can see stunning views of Paris and the details of the sculptures on the walls and roof.

When facing the church, the line forms to the left side of the building. They let groups of folks up at a time, and since there is only 1 staircase (and a narrow one at that), you have to wait for visitors to exit before more people are admitted. If the line is long, there is a bistro directly across the street from the line, which I took advantage of since it was raining, I was cold, and hubby let me run over there for a coffee. The view of Paris from the towers is lovely. Being so close to the famous gargoyles is a giggle! Lots of great photo opportunities, this was a nice stop on our itinerary."

(By the way, if you see something you like on the way up, get it. You won't see it again on the way down.) The second is the rampart over the entrance about half-way up. Then you either do or don't take the last 100+ steps to the top of the bell tower.There are other places in Paris with better views--the large brownish iron tower by the river comes to mind, but the fun of climbing the stairs at Notre Dame lies in knowing that people--including hunchbacks--have been doing it for five hundred years."

We were in the last group that went up for the day. It was worth the 35 minutes we had to stand in the freezing cold!! There are multiple viewing stops at the top. You can see everywhere over the city. Better views than the Eiffel Tower or Arc de Triomphe. You are eye level with the gargoyles, and even go into the bell tower.

If there is one sight in paree that isn't likely to leave you indifferent, it's this one... dramatically towering alongside the banks of the Seine. To call it breathtaking is simplistic... it's overwhelming when you consider it took labourers over a hundred years to complete. Who doesn't remember the haunting image of Quasimodo, Hugo's anti-hero swingin'dem bells from its famous bell tower or the scary gargoyles that literally make you stop in your tracks... grotesque, yet captivatingly beautiful.. Inside, the stunning rose window has been courting and seducing millions of travellers and is without a doubt one of Paris's wonders.But many come here for the spiritual comfort or creepy interest to gawk at the archeological crypt. Over all, for sheer aesthetic grandeur it takes a lot to beat, being the apex in the Gothic pantheon with a harmony that focuses all your senses, especially its facade which is recognisable all over the world. One has to stand still at the end of its plaza and allow the grand vista to sweep over you. I love its portals and the series of 28 statues representing the Kings of Israel. Not even its Grand Gallery can avert your eyes from its imposing ornate towers which, when you have climbed the requiem of stairs, offer a view from its eerie that looks down a plunge of 68 mt over the IIe de la Cite, the Seine and the whole city.... just a few steps to climb... all 400 of them, shuffling behind the constant flow of minions or devotees training for marathons. I love the rear facade... its perspective is as beautiful as its front with those stunning Gothic spires. You would find it hard to find in Paris better example of Medieval history, and Paris certainly abounds with enough treasures, yet nowhere is it as hauntingly gorgeous as this grand dame's long halls, vaulted ceilings with soft light filtering through the intricate stained glass that elevates medieval history regarding divinity and humanity. Just like royalty, a queen to be specific, the cathedral welcomes the visitor to its grandeur... but wait till you see her twin sister, just north of the city in St-Denis, whose basilica and royal necropolis will knock your socks off."

If the first group is spell bound by the view and are taking a long time to take photos or just take in the view it would add to the waiting time of those below."

So the lines start packing up quite early in the day, so you'll want to get there at around 8am if you want to get up there early. The climb itself is predictably pretty harsh and strenuous, so it's not advisable to any little children or elderly people. However for everyone else it's definitely well worth the walk up to the top. The officials usually send 20 people up at a time and wait for the groups of people to go down before sending more up.The views are well worth the price to go up. Because of the location and the lower height, the views even shame the Eiffel Tower. The front facing view is the main feature, but the left and even back facing views are almost as good. If you are bringing large photographic equipment though do be warned that it is very narrow up the top, so no large bags or tripods."

Notre Dame is worth a quick visit to see what the fuss is about, but there's nothing spectacular to warrant going out of your way, especially if you've seen other cathedrals across Europe. However, it's located on the island in the middle of the city, so you'll undoubtedly have to walk pass it at some point. To get here, the nearest metro station is Cite on Line 4. If you plan on using the metro frequently--which isn't a necessity because Paris is a fairly walkable town--buy a carnet of 10 metro tickets for 14.10 euros, rather than paying 1.80 euros for each ticket individually. The 1-Day Mobilis tickets (for unlimited 24-hr use of public transit) are only economical if you plan on using public transportation more than 4 trips per day since it costs 7 euros."

I truly believe this is a little bit of a somewhat hidden gem of Paris (in comparison to other highlights)When facing the front of Notre-Dame if you go down the left side of the building. There you will find a line. This is a line to go up into the towers.The towers are in the Paris Museum Pass which I highly recommend for anyone going to 2 or more of any of the museums, attractions and city highlights.I would suggest going on a clear day as when you get up there the beautiful view of Paris is even better without the smog/haze. Also go in the early morning or late afternoon when there is not to much sun on the line area. As you may sit there for at least an hour +. Go with a friend if possible and take turns in the line. As with all major Paris attractions there are plenty of places to get food, drinks and souvenirs. Also with all popular Paris attractions watch out for the pick pockets and con artists. If you can hold out on eating high priced fast snack food in the area i would suggest strolling across Pont de l'Archev\u00each\u00e9 bridge and sitting in one of the lovely bistros along the river.This is not an attraction for people with disabilities, heart conditions or who have very poor health. There are allot of stairs and the passage is very very narrow in some places. So if you are claustrophobic or very afraid of heights skip this.It can take at least 15min to climb to the top and that is at a good pace. They give you a time limit when at the top to see the view and take pictures. The catwalk up there is very narrow and very high. But if you can get over all that the view is so worth it."

Residents of France come here to worship (although I really don't see how with all the tourists). I am so grateful that they allow people like me in to see this place of beauty and experience it firsthand. So remember although it is beautiful and you want to talk about it with your friends - be QUIET and respect what this place is meant to be.

If you have the time, Just browse through them all first( there are 4/5 ) , found that certain items were much cheaper (up to 50%) when compared.And, i am serious about their being 300 odd, closer to 400 narrow windy stairs!! There is almost nowhere to rest so be prepared if you plan on going to the top."

I would definitely not recommend this for anyone not prepared to climb the steps. They only allow a certain number of people up to the different stages (for obvious, safety reasons). This is what caused the long wait. However you climb up to the very top eventually, get a panoramic view of Paris, and are able to see the gargoyles and other unique facets of the structure up close."

            "review": "I would have liked to give this more. This was my second time up the towers, and it was the thing I wanted to do most in Paris because I had fond memories from my time up in 2006. The view from atop the cathedral is beautiful and the gargoyles are incredible. You can also visit two bells, which is always a nice treat. The architecture of the cathedral is impressive and my memory really didn't let me down: beautiful gargoyles, statues, clocks... everywhere!Even so, I've decided to only give this attraction three stars, and that's because of the overall experience. The towers open at 10 am. We went there at 9.30 and the line was already about as long at the cathedral itself. They only let people in in groups of about 20 because the top is very small.Ten o'clock went by and the line didn't move at all. I left my husband in the line and went to the front to check out what was happening. Some workers went in, gave some surly looks, didn't say anything. Finally, at around 10.30, a worker came out of the towers and hung up a piece of paper saying they were on strike. So we wasted time waiting in line for nothing--and I don't even want to imagine how long the poor people at the very front of the line had been waiting!The strikes alternated: work one day, strike one day. I tried to find a reason for the strikes, but the only news I could find online was from almost a year prior, where it mentioned that the workers had gone on strike to protest against pickpocketers. So that's clever, isn't it? Protest against pickpocketers by leaving the tourists outside like easy prey waiting in line for an attraction that won't open, but tourists don't know it won't open because workers don't declare they're on strike until half an hour after opening time? Fabulous...Despite that, I still really wanted to visit the towers because I knew my husband would love seeing the gargoyles up close. I calculated which day the workers wouldn't be on strike and it was our very last day in Paris. We got in line at 10 am and had to wait for almost two hours. All in all, it was a long wait but I think it could have been worse. The wait is outside and there's absolutely nothing to cover you, so pray for mild weather.Pickpockets thrive around Notre Dame, so beware! The very first thing we saw the day we arrived in Paris was a group of police officers searching a group of girls who clearly looked like professional pickpocketers.While waiting in line for the towers, we were approached the same group of girls we'd seen on our first day. They use the age-old technique of distracting you with a fake petition while they surround you and take everything they can. My husband gave them a rotund \"Leave!\" when they approached, so they gathered around another tourist a little bit ahead. My blood was boiling because the tourist was so concentrated trying to read the petition--the trick was working--and he was already surrounded. I went over there and shouted out \"Ignore them! They want to steal from you!\" several times and the girls stuck their tongues out at me and vanished. We didn't see them bothering anyone else in the line that morning.The fee to go up the towers is 8,5\u20ac. The moment you finally get into the tower, you have to climb several flights of stairs until you reach a tiny gift shop where you buy your tickets. Then, it's back to the stairs until you reach the first viewpoint where all the gargoyles are. It's beautiful to just stand there and look at all the details, but it can be tricky to take good photos because, apart from the wire fixture encasing the entire gallery, now they've also added a thick black net. It's practically impossible to take a picture of a person and a gargoyle or the views at the same time because the big black net obstructs the views and the statues.After another flight of stairs, you can visit the very top of the tower and there's protective glass. There's a worker up there with you hurrying you along. It turns out there's a sign that says you can only stay up there for maximum five minutes. Once the five minutes are up, the worker starts calling everyone to go back down and leave.The exit leaves you right by entrance of the cathedral, on the other side of the building. It's a real shame that the visit to the towers doesn't connect with the inside of the cathedral. Right at the exit door, there should be access to the cathedral because, after waiting in the cold for two hours, who wants to wait another extra hour to go inside? Plus, entrance to the cathedral is free, so if you've already paid to go into the towers, it would be fabulous if after your visit you could directly access the interior.But that's asking too much, I'm afraid."

We arrived at 9 to queue to go up Notre Dame Tower even though it opens at 10am. We were not the first people there but luckily we were in the first group of 20 to enter the tower. By 10am you were unable to see the end of the line. I definetly recommend getting there early as they only allow groups of 20 access into the tower every ten minutes. Keeping the numbers small at the top of the tower led to a more enjoyable experience as you were able to move around without fighting your way through the crowds. There are alot of stairs and small spaces to fit through so you need to be reasonably fit and not at all claustrophobic to visit the tower. Make sure you buy anything you want from the gift shop before you visit the tower as you can't get back to it."

The line is slow and gets long if you wait till later in the day. Plus early sun is better for pictures. -at time of visit admission was \u20ac8. -"

It's not a terribly taxing climb and the views of the Cathedral and of Paris are incredible. Being able to see the chimera/gargoyles up close is remarkable. Just the sheer size and detail involved in the exterior of Notre Dame is hard to take in without being up in the towers and able to see it more closely. There are some small annoyances like tight spaces and people jumping in front of you to get their selfies in. Also, there are a few times where you are sort of stuck between sections while they wait for people to finish. This is a great crowd control measure, but it feels a bit mysterious since they don't tell you why you can't keep going (or at least I wasn't around when we were told). I thought it was very well-organized, safe, and must-do part of any trip to Paris."

It contained beautiful jewels on crowns and statues. they also have a small gift shop the we bought a few things from for our children.

If you arrive during the day, you will wait 3-4 hours.

I wasn't sure if it was worth it but had heard that kids like the close up view of all the gargoyles carved around the rooftop. Since I was with my elementary school aged nephews, we decided to give it a shot. Not only was it really cool for them to see the gargoyles up close, but it offered a spectacular, 360 degree view of the city including the Seine, the Eiffel Tower and Montmarte. The pictures of the gargoyles in the foreground with those landmarks in the background came out beautifully. I highly recommend it."

The climb is steep and the spiral staircase is dimly lit. Those with vertigo may be challenged by this climb.

The view of Paris is spectacular; and we love the crazy gargoyles; but it is a poor experience compared to 20 years ago; before the netting was so insanely tight that you can hardly take photos of anything without pulling at it; and it is even hard to maneuver around the corners. As well, the staff now hustle you along, even if it is not particularly crowded. They want an entire group out before the next one is allowed in. No loitering! It makes for a less enjoyable visit, but I guess the numbers now just demand this level of control. I expect that soon, getting in here will be a whole different matter, with heightened security. Avoid the corner restaurant across the street, which looks nice, and charges a fortune for coffee and even has paid toilets!"

Climbing the towers is no easy task, so if you are not used to stairs, don't even enter the line: you will be climbing a lot of them. The line is super long, so be prepared to wait two hours more or less to enter the towers, especially under the sun. The good thing is that you will be close to a fence most of the time so you will have plases to rest, unlike the Louvre line.If you are under 26 entrance is free, but you will need to pay otherwise. As always, go for the museum pass to go on all majors attractions of Paris with the same ticket."

You are not required to sit for the service, but may silently stroll along the edges of the church, soaking in history and possibly lighting a candle in prayer.

The line for the narrow staircase up to the Notre Dame towers start around an hour before it is officially open at 10a.m.- by 9:15a.m., there were about 20 people already in line and they only allow around 20 people up every 15 min. or so. It is well worth the efforts to climb up the 387 or so odd stairs up to the Tower. Before arriving to the West Tower, you will stop by a gift shop and this is where the admission fee of 8.50 euros is collected. You continue on the staircase until arriving at the top where the famous gargoyles and chimeras are found along with the wonderful views of the Paris skyline with the River Seine below. Views of St Chapelle and Montmartre are unbelievable from this point. It is quite narrow up here and you are encouraged to keep moving along to keep the flow of traffic going. There are no bathroom facilities until you go back down to ground level.Walking across from the North to South tower, look at both directions of the detailed architecture and for the famous Styrga -chimera-- a horn and wing beast with a human body holding his head in his hands and sticking his tongue out at Paris- used to scared off bad spirits. There are many different types of gargoyles as you look up from here also- they are used as rain gutters as the rain water drains out from their mouths.Make sure you walk in to see the famous 13 ton Emmanuel bell as well- made popular by Quasimodo in \"Hunchback of Notre Dame.\" Continue across to the South Tower on your left and up another set of narrow steps to the \"Sommet\"-- the summit-- you are only allowed a 5 minute visit here as it is very narrow. The views of the River Seine are totally incredible from here is you see how Notre Dame Cathedrale is located right smack in the middle of Ile de la Cite island. Great photo vantage points through the barbed wire.From here you begin your descent down which should not take that much time ~ 15-20 min. at the most. If you need to look for restrooms, they are located in the back of Notre Dame- where the flying buttresses are located- next to the park.Anyone can make it for this climb as my 81 year old mom was able to make it without any problems! She states that she is glad she made this climb for the superb views!"

Access to the tower is from the side of the cathedral and a fee is charged or you can get in with the Paris Museum Pass. There is NO priority line for those with a Museum Pass. We visited at the end of October and arrived at about 9:45 am - the tower opens at 10 am and there was a relatively large line up. As the access and exit points for the tower are limited, they allow in a bunch of people, and then there is a wait (10 minutes or so?) till the next group is let in. We made it in at around 10:30 am. You walk up a short flight of stairs to a small room where they sell the tickets. Everyone in the group has to wait here again till all have arrived. Then we climbed to the first level, which is cool as it gives a good view of the gargoyles and access to the belfry. The view over the city is also nice, but the mesh netting they've hung means that you won't be able to get good pictures if you have a DSLR. The small lenses on smartphones work fine. (Note - the netting obstructs the city view, not the gargoyle view.)The area here on this level is quite small so we made our way around it and ended up in line again. It turned out that we had to wait for the previous group to exit the top level before we could go up. The wait ended up being so long that we didn't even bother going up to the top level, and decided we'd rather just head straight back down rather than get caught in another line up somewhere along the way. We finally exited the tower at 11:30 - nearly two hours after getting in the original line up, and that was without going to the top deck. In our opinion, simply not worth it for the 10-15 minutes of total viewing time. There are lots of other places in the city that offer great views (Arc de Triomphe and Sacre Couer were two that we did) without the frustrating line ups."

On the day we bought museum pass we went to towers however they closed it at 16:45 even on the pass it says 17:30 for closure. The guard was super rude, waved his hand at us and said come tomorrow!! The next day we went there at 16:25 and again they closed it!!!!!! There were many people like us which is not nice at all. When i tried to talk to the guard he didn t communicate at all!!!! When i said what they do is not compliant with the information all he said was \"that s your problem\" unbelievable and such rude people."

We had already purchased the Paris Museum Pass to enter the towers which made it a little easier once we were up there, however this doesn't give you priority in terms of queuing. When we visited, the towers opened at 10am and we arrived at 10:30am, by which time there was a fairly large queue, so perhaps get there earlier if you want to be ahead in the queue! We were fairly far back but we were in within an hour, which wasn't too bad. Once you are admitted in, be prepared to get those legs working because there are a LOT of stairs. But it is absolutely 100% worth it! The view is incredible up there, it's pretty magical. We took our time walking around and even went up the second set of stairs taking you to the very top, which was amazing. Definitely visit, the view is amazing and seeing the gargoyles and the bells right up close is fantastic."

The naturalism of its sculptures and stained glass are in contrast with earlier Romanesque architecture.The cathedral has 10 bells. The largest, Emmanuel, original to 1681, is located in the south tower and weighs just over 13 tons and is tolled to mark the hours of the day and for various occasions and services. This bell is always rung first, at least 5 seconds before the rest."

Eventually the small space made me a little claustrophobic (which does happen on occasion). Up top it has some nice views but is mainly covered in wires so pretty hard to get very good photos. Gargoyles up close were cool. My disappointment was when you exit the towers you have to go wait in another line to go inside the cathedral.

In the high tourist season, if you wait until10 to get in line, you'll be waiting for hours in the heat. So get there early.The climb is challenging - about 400 steps, I think. You'll be stopping regularly in order to wait for the groups in front of you to advance, because it's a one-way passage. So relax and enjoy the view. Do check out the belfry with the old bells from days past, and do go all the way around to the back so you can see the main steeple. The whole passage will take you 45 minutes or an hour, and there's also a nice garden area when you exit, so stop and take a rest there. Don't buy the overpriced food in the sandwich places across from where you stand in line. have someone hold your place and go a block or two further north where food is more reasonable. And then do lunch in the Quartier Latin."

It is stunning, beautiful, moving and absolutely massive. You MUST go see it. Notre Dame is free to enter and if there is a line to get in, it moves quickly. However, Notre Dame towers are a different story. There is a charge (I believe it's 8.5 Euro) to climb to the top. I've done this twice in my life and it's one of the most stunning views of Paris. You can see Sacre Coeur, Eiffel Tower and so much more. It's totally worth the climb (do suggest you're in good shape though- and that you're not claustrophobic). But this time, when we reached the top there was a bottleneck. At first we were able to move about, take great photos, enjoy the view, bond with the gargoyles...but then towards the opposite end of the towers, we got stuck and didn't move for about an hour. It seems that what happened was that they allow people up to the south tower, but because there's only one way up & down, they let people up, wait, and then let people down. In theory this may work, but on days with big crowds, it simply caused a huge bottleneck effect, confusion, and a group of annoyed tourists stuck on top of a tall building. It was incredibly frustrating and I felt like I wasted unecessary time. We had already waited over an hour to go up, and then to wait another 45 minutes to go down- it just didn't make sense. Poolry organized and not managed well to handle the crowds. It's a shame, because it's an amazing attraction."

Climbing the spiral stairs to the top of the Towers of Notre Dame was very strenuous but worth it for the fantastic views at the top. I liked the views from atop the Arc de Triomphe but I liked the views from the Towers even more. One of the things I liked most about the Towers was the gargoyles. I don't know how many different ones are up there, but each one is intriguing. My favorite photo from my trip to Paris is the one with a gargoyle in the foreground with the Eiffel Tower in the distance. Be sure to go up the Towers when you visit Notre Dame Cathedral."

You get up close and personal with the Gargoyles and there is a fantastic view over the city. You can see lots of the main attractions like the Louvre, Eiffel Tower and Arc De Triomphe.Once we entered the towers the visit lasted for around an hour.

In a hurry? You can enter and take a 15 minute tour walking around the periphery. Have more time? There are endless nooks and crannies filled with art and religious statuary.Downside: (At least when we went and I have heard this is not uncommon) Tons of rude tourists, with their phones and cameras taking pictures with their flashes on, while the church attendants and priests attempt to stop them. It's dim and. . .cloistered. . .in the church, but many people apparently are not fans of available light photography.

The views are spectacular - not only of the square in front and the city but also of the church spires, and all the amazing and weird statues. A view appreciated by many for many centuries til today. It's like going back in time!"

It was a long climb up, with spiral stair cases that seemed to go on forever. You are initially taken to a gift shop and are forced to wait there for five to ten minutes no doubt to splurge your tourist money on the thingamajigs they're hocking but once you finally get up to the Cathedral top its very lovely and although there aren't as many bells as there should be, they're still there, and the gargoyles also are quite lovely. Since the flow of people is controlled, it doesn't get overcrowded and you can find your own space to appreciate the place and take it all in. You are then taken to a higher roof top where the final treat is a spectacular view of Paris. It was jaw dropping gorgeous.highly recommended."

Once inside you climb a long spiral staircase typical of medieval towers, in this case with relatively few step outs for catching your breath. You first reach the belfry in what I think is the South tower, then you climb to the top of the opposite tower via another spiral staircase (shorter than the initial climb). You have about 5 minutes to circle around on the cat walk, with many, many nice views of Paris below, gefore descending a long spiral staircase that is the twin of the one you ascended initially. I'm a veteran tower climber (Bath, Yorkshire, Edinburgh, Cologne, etc) and this easily compares with those, but with better gargoyles :-)."

It cost 8-10 Euro to enter the tower, which has its own separate line and entry point (if you stand in front of the cathedral, the tower line runs along the left side of the building). This was easily the highlight of our family trip to France. Climbing the tower stairs was a little like completing a long hike: tiring, but so worth it once you reach the top! Be warned, these stairs are very narrow, and there is no place to stop and take a breather. With people climbing single file both ahead and behind you, it's definitely a test of physical fitness! The views from the top are extraordinary. Looking for that perfect postcard shot to wow your friends? This. Is. It. The climb is broken up into three levels: an entry gift shop, a mid-level with awesome views (and an opportunity to see the famous bells of Notre Dame!), and finally, a climb to the very top of the tower, which made me almost giddy. Though the bell observation area was closed when we visited, hearing them ring while we stood high up on Notre Dame gave me chills. I cannot emphasize this enough: do not be afraid of that climb. It is so worth it.Read more: https://adventuringthegreatwidesomewhere.wordpress.com/2015/05/06/48-hours-in-paris-part-ii/"

The group must wait here before climbing further up to the bell tower (or if one chooses - to exit, walk down). I did not see notices but please note - you must be in good shape and not afraid of heights to do this. Several people had to stop the catch their breath and there is little room to step aside and rest. The stairwell is spiral and contained. This is an excellent way to work off the delicious French pastries!"

Maybe the only one starring in a novel. We arrived in the early morning, walked right in, took our time, and saw everything. Later in the day the line was at least an hour long. If you do your research, and read the right guide books, you can see almost all of Paris without waiting in line. While viewing Notre Dame don't miss the archeological dig on the property. Very nicely done. The cathedral needs to be seen at least twice -- once in the day when the light will be streaming through the stained glass windows, and once in the evening when the City of Lights illuminates the church in a breathtaking manor."

We had the opportunity this time in the evening when they are open until 11 pm (only certain nights). Although the line was long, it went faster than expected. The climb is long but there is a place to rest after the first 159 steps or so. When we got to the first lookout, at gargoyle level, I was dumbstruck by the sheer beauty and magnificence of the cathedral and the view. Seeing the structure and being able to touch history was inspiring. The Eiffel Tower was lit up in the distance, and you could see Sacre Coeur to the right. The city, in all of it's shimmering glory, spread out before us. It was truly awesome. The next climb takes you to the very top of the towers, where the view is equally wonderful. You see the cathedral from a vantage point that is not possible from the ground. I didn't want to come down, but as it was closing we had to.If you get the chance to climb the towers, don't pass it up. If you can do it at night, with the moonlight behind you, a warm breeze in your face, and the lights of Paris spread out before you, all the better. It's an experience that will live in your heart forever."

A member of the staff pulled us out of line and sent us to the front because we had a small child in a stroller. The gesture was welcome after subjecting our little one to the 3 hour queue at Versailles. Anyway, the hike up the stairs is long and steep but totally worth it if you are physically able. The views from the top were incredible. Seeing the interior of the bell tower was impressive. The top of the bell tower had some very tight squeezes. I'm not large but I commented to my husband that at 7 months pregnant, I would not have been able to squeeze through. So please be aware that the hike up is physically demanding and there are tight spots at the top."

I guess pretty much everyone would agree Paris is amazing from any perspective, yet there is something awesome in seeing it from above. Whether it's from the Sacre-Coeur, the Eiffel Tour, the Arab Institute or the Arc de Triomphe, the view on the city of love, light and what-nots will amaze. However, the towers of Notre Dame is much more than just a good view.There is something magnificent in being so close to the stones of that masterpiece, being able to take photos of the gargoyles from up close and to have the winds on the top mess up your hair. This place is worth the queue, the money and the workout to get up there! I would not recommend it to people who can't climb up 3 stories of stairs, it is narrow and tough even for the fit!"

The stairs going up are steep and very narrow. And lots of them! In the heat of the day, be sure to bring water with you. But once you make it up, the views are incredible. And it was very cool for the kids to see the gargoyles up close and personal. We also went into the small bell area. In the interest of keeping the lines moving, they do only allow you a few minutes up top but it was definitely enough to take in all the views and to get some wonderful pictures. We purchased skip the line tickets which paid off as we were able to get right up. So glad we did this as the lines were long, probably at least a 1 hour wait but we didn't have to wait at all."

I highly recommend a Sandemans walking tour of Paris as they tell you loads of history and quirky facts about the main attractions as well as some other random not so well known facts and best of all its FREE!! The only thing is that they don't allow time for you to go inside so try and make time to come back and see the magic inside!"

The views were spectacular and as we didn't get to go up the Eiffel Tower, this was the next best thing. Just be prepared to climb lots of stairs on a narrow spiral case and to squish around corners once on the balcony are up top.. Lovely seeing the gargoyles up close to. My son went into the bell tower and said it was quite a small doorway he had to crouch in. The descent wasn't too bad though almost made you feel dizzy :D"

But it was worth the hour wait! The view you get to see once you climb the stairs (there are no elevators, and the stairwell is very skinny so if you are claustrophobic, just be aware!) I have been wanting to climb towers but either time nor the company I went with during previous visits didn't allow the opportunity.) We had only one day to spend in Paris before we flew out and that was my ultimate goal. We loved it! It costs us 14 euros/person. My suggestion is get there before the doors open for the towers so you do not have to wait so long in line. We happened to be in Paris during one of the hotter days. Thank goodness there were vendors right across the street while we waited in line so we can get bottle waters while waiting ;) Another tip: as you exit, instead of going down to exit, go up the stairs to the very top tower.Definitely worth-while to do!!!"

We paid for a \"skip the line\" tour which provides you with a guide; a tour of Ile de la Cite; Notre Dame Cathedral and quick access to the Towers. It's worth the $$ in terms of not wasting time standing in line and the added information from the guide about Paris, Notre Dame and the towers. There are a lot of stone steps to climb in a narrow stairway; but everyone moves pretty slowly. However small children and people with mobility or breathing problems might want to skip it (there's no elevator). At the first level there is a gift shop (which you will not see on the way back down from the towers via a different staircase). Next level up has wonderful views of Paris; you can walk around the narrow parapets at your own pace and get close up views and pictures of the many Gargoyles and Chimera. I think this level has the most interesting panoramic views of the city and the widest assortment of stone creatures. Don't rush to get to the next (highest) level. That next level also has some very good,high 360 views of the city and some gargoyles. Then you descend, without stopping down a different staircase from the very top to the ground. There is also a stop partway up where you can visit the bell tower and see the large bells from close-up."

The lines get long fast and by the time we left, the lines were ridiculously long (both to enter the cathedral and to the tower climb). But, it is so worth it. The views from the towers are amazing and the gargoyles are also really cool! The bells are amazing too! Beyond describable - but highly recommended.There are stairs, narrow walkways and it is windy in certain places. If you are able and healthy - do it - you won't regret it!! It only takes about an hour (not counting the hour in line), but it is so neat!! A little tip: If you are in the line early, there is a little cafe across the street that sells coffee (latte & espresso) and baked goods, there are a couple other walk-up counters that open about 30 mins before the line door opens too."

You climb several steps then go into the gift shop where you can buy tickets to get to the top.The climb is an adventure... around 325 steps gets you to the main level. Close up views of the gargoils and great views of the crowd below. The best views are from the very top, another 125 or so steps higher. The views from the top are only bested by the Eiffel Tower itself.Don't plan on climbing the steps if you have any mobility issues. They are tightly wound, spiraling marble steps.

The doors open at 10 AM. We watched the lines over several days and they always seemed too long. On our last morning in Paris (a Wednesday) we went at 10 AM, the line was already 200 yards/meters down the block. We waited 75 min to pay and enter. The access is very tightly controlled; once inside there is more waiting to be allowed to the first stage, which is where the gargoyles are seen up close, and nice views of the Seine, Eiffel Tower, Sacre Coeur. Then more waiting to be allowed to the top. We ran out of time and actually descended without getting to the top.My guess is that you should budget 2.5 hours to get in and get to the top in high season. Of course the view is utterly unique and that is why it's worth waiting, but the wait was terrible and so 4 stars, not 5."

You get up close and personal with gargoyles. You talk about The Hunchback of Notre Dame, (our 12 year old daughter knew all about Quasimodo from the Disney movie!, but Victor Hugo's original work is a wonderful read). And the views are just spectacular. But do be aware that there are 422 steps and going up is strenuous. You can pause along the way, and if you need to, do not let those behind you intimidate you. There are a few narrow landings where you can step aside and catch your breath. This is covered with your Museum Pass (you can buy online before you even leave on your vacation. The Pass is great for adults and not needed for children), but there is no quicker entry to the Tower. You wait in line with everyone else."

It is one of the first \"sights\" I go back to as soon as we arrive annually in Paris. This time, in the early evening on the longer days of the year, the sun was shinning under clouds and had illuminated the towers as if they were a movie set ablaze in spot lights. Breath taking. Pay close attention to what the changing texture of the light does to this among the grandest buildings in the world."

It's mind-boggling.If you don't like history or architecture (or lines!) then pass on this one. If you love history and/or architecture, then (regardless of the lines) make sure to go. What can we say...the inside, you just need to budget at least an hour to go through it and read all the fascinating stuff.The outside, just take the tour and gaze in awe at the architecture. Get disgusted as the graffiti at the top. And wonder how the whole place stays up after all these years.Enjoy. Definitely a \"must do\" when in Paris.PS. The tower trip is not for the faint of heart (or stamina). Lots of steps. Make sure you are in shape."

It is free unless you want to go up in the bell tower and I think it costs like 8 Euros/pp. The church is literally right outside a metro station (Sant Michel). There will be a line, but it moves really quickly. We were admitted in about 10 minutes. There is an audio guide which I thought was really helpful and allowed free access to some of the church's relics. For example, they say they have fibers from the cross Christ bore and also a nail. They also say they have the crown of thorns. There is a cool statue of Joan of Arc on the right and an interesting statue of a Saint holding Denis holding his severed head. If you want to go up to the bell tower, the line is around the corner on the left side of the church outside. They only let so many in so the wait time is longer. We waited about an hour, but there were little cafes and tourist shops across the street to pass the time. It was neat to see the bells. It is A LOT of walking up a narrow winding staircases, so if you are claustaphobic, this may not be for you. Overall, the church is a must do. I felt pretty safe though I am always aware of my belongings. It is also a stone's throw away from the Bridge of Locks (Pont des Arts). You can buy a lock (I am sure the vendor is making a killing!) or bring your own. Neat to see how many."

Maybe because of its situation, with the river seine on both sides.As you walk across the bridge from the west side, you immediately face the 2 towers and an open square, then as you continue to walk down the south passage by the river, you come across some open gardens and peace. The cathedral inside is pretty impressive too, however I like the outside views more :-)Not to miss on the next visit to Paris."

There are 422 steps up and around the same amount down (you go down the other side). On the way up, we stopped fairly regularly at balconies or bell towers which either showed us gorgeous views of Paris or were steeped in history. The walking back down, however, was non-stop. Thankfully we're young so we could handle it, but we stayed at the back as there was an elderly lady who was struggling. They waited for us on the balcony bits, but I feel that perhaps the tour guide could've come back and checked on us as she was really shattered and could have probably used a sit or six on the way up."

Great views of gargoyles and chimaeras, which I absolutely adored. Be careful at one point. During you're visit you'll come across a place where some stairs go down on your left and there's also a little door on your right which takes you even higher up. Some people went to the left and missed out on more views. Loved the descend on the stairs, it seemed like it would never come to an end."

You actually stop on different levels, so you don't climb all 400 steps at the same time. It was worth the wait in line (which wasn't all that long - maybe 45 minutes) and worth the climb. You could see all of Paris from the various viewpoints, all the ornamentation on the Cathedral, and even could go in the bell tower. We used our Paris Museum Pass for the admission price. We enjoyed this and our visit to Ste. Chappelle more than Notre-Dame Cathedral itself."

It is immense, grand and well worth your time. Do us all a favor though and tell your teenager to remove that stupid looking falt-billed ball cap with the stickers still on it before he goes in... and keep it off.

The way I would describe this place is that for anyone who has doubts about God, this is a place that somehow is able to take away all doubts... during my visit there was a priest who stood in a ray of light shining down on him, I really felt like God was there with us and I felt an overwhelming rush of emotions that moved me to tears. What is really interesting was also the tour of the treasures, I felt a mix of emotions during that little tour. I was amazed by the beautiful works done by people in the past, but at the same time I also saw how much potential all the valuable had on changing real lives of our time. There is not doubt that Notre Dame is a must-see in Paris, it will inspire a lot in your heart and mind."

Plus, you need to have on good walking shoes and be in reasonable shape to climb the 387 steps."

I dis that first in 2001 and have come again another 4 times since. Be wary of the crowd as there are many pickpockets within this touristic place. There are souvenir shops )quite pricey though) on the left side of the Cathedral and across it is the public toilet on the sidewalk and walking further, you can come across Quasimodo restaurant. Yes, the same name of the Hunchback of Notre Dame. They serve good steaks and espresso."

Visit to the tower is free with the Paris Museum Pass however no priority, i.e. have to wait in the queue just like all others without ticket.The queue is long because they only allow a group of \"xx\" number of people up to the towers at any one time; this is due to the tight access, limited walk space at the tower top. And they work on a \"one-way\" system going up and down of the tower.Patience is key but it's worth the wait because the view from the tower is amazing and get to go into the bell tower to see the bells.Honestly, prefer this elevated view (compared to Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe), personal preference.Going up the tower - 3 \"stops\", first \"stop\" is the ticket counter and souvenir shop. At this level, we waited for a few minutes before being allowed to climb to the next \"stop\" as a group. Next \"stop\" gets us to the elevated view - nice view and nice close-up with the gargoyles. 3rd and last \"stop\" after more flights of stair took us to one of the bell towers - still get some really good elevated view, and get to some glimpse of the bells.The tower is accessible by steps/staircase only. For those who can't make it up, walk towards the back of the Notre-Dame Cathedral and the side (facing the river) - nice park with plenty of benches and a free public toilet too."

I'm claustrophobic and had no issues in the narrow, tall, stone, spiral stairs because there are windows that let fresh air and light in as you ascend/descend. I would not advise climbing if you are pressed for time because the cathedral has staff on 2 of the upper levels and they control the volume.

Thankfully they limit the numbers of people up at a time, which explains the slow moving line. It costs 8,50 euro and is covered by the museum pass. You even get to go into one of the bell towers to see the bells! This to me was worth the climb!

So you can do the math when you see how many is in line before you. When you get in to the tower you go to next level where you will pay for your ticket. (If you don't already have done that elsewhere.)When you get to the view you almost forget the long wait and just enjoy the view over this beautiful city. It rained when we where there but it is still a fantastic view.When you move around in the tower you figure out where they let people in in groups of 30 people. Otherwise it would be chaos.So get in line and have your camera ready when you get up there. Remember that there are two levels in the towers. Grab a brochure at the start. Enjoy."

Museum pass holders do not have any privilege of shorter queue here which I think was really making security sense (imagine the big crowd squeezing to climb the narrow stairs winding up with more than 400 steps). The long queuing time and exhausting climbing efforts was paid off with the stunning city view from the top of the tower. I could even see down there hundred or perhaps thousands of tourists queuing in the s-shape long queue eagerly awaiting to enter the cathedral in this sacred Easter Sunday."

After each level there is an option not to go up to the next level though so if you're finding it tough you're not stuck going up and up! I think its on the second or third level (not the very top) you see the Belfy which is really fun! Again, tiny narrow door, not disabled friendly or anything like that!!

During the day the line only gets longer as visits are tightly choreographed for reasons which will become obvious once you enter the very narrow and winding staircase. The stairs lead up to the north tower. Then there is a passageway to the belfry where Quasimodo worked. After that, there is a passage over to the south tower, which has another stairway up to the top. After a trip around the top of the south tower, there is a long winding stairway to the bottom. All along there are magnificient views across the city as well as overviews of the architecture and up-close experiences with the timbers holding the bells in place. In my opinion, the views are the best in Paris because one is literally in the center of the city where a stone in the cathedral's parvis or courtyard marks the point from which all distances in France were measured. The views are also great because they combine overviews of distant and nearby buildings and neighborhoods with up close looks at the distinctive gothic architecture and its gargoyle embellishments."

That figure normally wouldn't be an issue but because they let you in in groups of about 15 and it is a one in one out policy you can imagine how long you could be waiting. We got in about about 10.30am so not to bad. Once in you start the climb, which is broken up about half way through at the shop/ticket office. You stay here for a minute of two to get your tickets (if you've not be booked) then you carry up the tower. At the first observation level you can see for miles across Paris towards the Eiffel Tower and you can also see the Gargoyles and Chimera up close and personal. Further along is the Bell Tower, where you can see the bells, obviously. Then the last part is to the top of the tower for a 360 degree view of Paris. Time is limited to 5 minutes per group up here but that is ample to get your photos done. From here it is all downhill, a long way downhill though. All in all we were in and out within 40 minutes and probably would of been quicker had there not been a large school group in front of us. The building is just amazing and the views just as impressive. From my point of view i would much rather climb Notre-Dame than go to the top of the Eiffel Tower. If you do go here then you won't be disappointed."

You've been warned so don't complain if you go to the most visited city in the world in high season and have to wait to see everything lol!). It was the first Sunday of the month, and therefore it was free to go to the very top. It's always free to go into the church, but there is a fee to walk up. There was a long wait, of course since it was free, but we got some hot tea and coffee to keep us warm as we waited. Notre-Dame was the thing I wanted to see most in Paris and so we waited.It was of course worth the wait to save a bit of money and go all the way up. You get to stop at 2 different levels and you can stay as long as you want. It wasn't crowded (off season benefit) so we were able to take all of the pictures we wanted without other people getting in the way. At the top level you get to see Paris from 360 degrees and these will be your best pictures of Paris from above. You will have to climb all the way up (around 400 steps I think) so be prepared and also mindful of who might be in front of you if it's taking a while. There was one thing I did not enjoy about Notre-Dame and that was going inside to the actual Cathedral. They (not sure who exactly) put a souvenir shop right inside the church which bothered me a since I found they were taking away some of the importance and significance of the church. Sad to see that they were trying to make money off of a wonderful historical church. I'm sure tourists would buy souvenirs if they put it outside as well, but that's just their poor choice. It was of course beautiful inside and there was a lot to look at.Other than that, it was wonderful. There was a huge Christmas tree right in front of the cathedral since it was December, which really added a nice touch outside."

The point of a review is to read about the experience. The views are amazing, it's cool to see the church up close, all that. In my opinion, if you have to choose the Arc de Triomphe or Notre Dame, choose Notre Dame.Now, the actual experience - not the best. First off, the line can take kind of a while even if it's not very long because they limit how many people can go in at once, so it's best to get in line 15-30 mins before it opens in the morning. It seems like you're waiting in line to buy a ticket, but really you're waiting to have some guy do just about the most cursory and aloof check of your bag humanly possible. After that, you walk up a flight of stairs to what appears to be a gift shop...which it is, but it's also where you buy your tickets. No signs or anything telling you to do this. Once everyone in the group has bought tickets, you then can climb the tower. You get to stop at the first viewing platform, which seems like the end, but it's not. Again, zero signs or info. This is a one-way situation, where you then have to wait behind a Tensabarrier until you're allowed to climb all the way up. It's very unclear where the entrance on this platform is, but just keep walking until you can't anymore. From there, you climb to the top and you're only allowed 5 minutes - the snooty/kinda lazy employees will tell you this, but as I said, they're kinda lazy, so they don't really chase you down.So, climbing Notre Dame is a must-do experience in Paris, but you'll have to deal with a bit of rudeness. I guess they just get sick of dealing with tourists? But I dont' have much sympathy, since millions of people visit every year and they must be rolling in money. Honestly, most people we encountered in Paris were very nice and helpful, so these guys were not the norm. And not all of them were rude, but the ones who were soured our experience.*if you like my review, I hope you'll click the 'helpful' button; those of us who write reviews love to get them and it motivates us to do more :) *"

Even though is really high and it requires patience to go up to the top, it totally worth it.I do not suggest to go with a large backpack or things in the hand, as stairs are really small and it might be more complicated to get through those small spaces. Also, it is better to go early in the morning!! During the day the queue is really long, and a lot of time is wasted....something you wouldn't like to do if you are only a couple of days in Paris. Make an effort, go early, and you will take a better advantage of the day!In the upper tower, there is a small balcony to appreciate the view. Up there it also gets a little bit crowded, specially because everybody tries to take panoramic pictures (which is totally understandable), and you get only 5 minutes in the upper external area (so everybody has the possibility of visiting). So...get early, be patient and enjoy the view.P.S. Go to the Square next to the Cathedral! It's super nice!"

The rose windows and the stained glass make for an ethereal and otherworldly experience (just what you would want in a Church).We arrived at the tale end of a Gregorian Mass and it was like traveling backward in time. We decided to hang back and observe, so as not to disturb those who had arrived on time. I am not Catholic, but even I was moved by the experience. On a more practical note: there was plenty of available seating if one wishes to attend Mass and it is worth a pilgrimage. As a point of interest we glimpsed artifacts from the past and viewed the archeological excavations in the lower part of the church.The cathedral is steeped in history, mystery, and glory. It is a must stop in a visit to Paris. It was a solemn and engaging experience."

The line was incredibly long for a very chilly damp day (it started sleet/snow by the end of the viist). But worth the wait. You will get a perspective on Paris like no other. You must be prepared for two things:1) The stairs are VERY steep, tight and winding on your way up. It was tough for some people.2) You are VERY high up when you step out on the first tower, and it was very windy when we visited. My occasional freak out on heights kicked in big time. I was happy and content to keep my back to the tower and take in the sights but I could not walk around much less make the traverse across to the other tower over open space (!) or climb up higher on the other tower. My family did and LOVED both the unique adventure and views.Another lady and I broke the rules and went down the \"up\" stairs even though it says not to. Sorry, but it was the only way. IF you have to do this, watch for when a next group comes up (they time them in small clusters which is why the line is so long) and then you will have a mostly clear stairway down (see my point #1 on why this is important)You can then meet your party outside of the other tower - exit is clearly marked."

We killed time by my wife went to buy ice creams at the cafe across the road whilst I stayed in the queue.The gargoyles ar everywhere and are fantastic. The towers are amazing and we were in awe at how they could build such a fantastic structure.The views are great from the top. My wife does not like stairs or heights but whilst there were many stairs and at some stages you feel enclosed you also get unobstructed views of the city. My wife loved it .It is well worth the visit.Highly recommend this tour and just eat your ice cream in the queue"

Thankgod we booked a skip the line tour because the line for the towers was horrendous. We walked straight past the line and to the front where we were allowed straight in by the guard. we headed up to the first level which had a little gift shop in it and then started climbing. If you are not into climbing numerous steps in only one direction, that being windy and up then this is definitely not something you should do. We braved it and pushed through and made it to the top. I am soo happy that we did this because the view was absolutely amazing. You could see the entire city and you can walk the whole way around the tower to see the city from every angle. They only allow a certain amount of people up at a time so don't worry it is not overly crowded like the Eiffel Tower.The towers left a lasting memory and an exciting check for your itinerary."

After walking around and seeing the inside, we found the line to go up to the top of the towers. People at the entrance said that they let in 30 people every ten minutes. The line didn't seem bad at all, but it seemed that it took us about 30 minutes to get in (although we had definitely fewer than 60 people in front of us). Walking up the stairs is fun--our kids loved it. Once you get to the top, it's not just the view-it's the atmosphere up there..especially if you happen to be by the bell tower when the bells are ringing. Definitely worth the 8.50 euros for this experience."

My third trip up these towers and while it was misty and we could see many of the Parisian landmarks it's always awesome to see the gargoyles so close up. The steps are challenging but just take your time they are not unmanageable and come in sections so time to rest in between. One thing I was shocked about was the lack of control of people going up and down the steps on the top and final tower. Usually they have staff to allow people up and down in turns to avoid two people meeting in the stairs which are very narrow and almost impossible to pass on. We were coming down when people were coming up and it was really dangerous as we had to pass on the inside (on the narrowest part of the staircase) meaning the steps were impossibly small and with wet and slippery marble also very dangerous. One slip would've meant a fall collecting all the people on the way down. Really poorly managed today - it was like a staff member had just disappeared off their duty??? Also the French security services have obviously increased security at the religious sites in Paris and there were heavily armed soldiers around the cathedral that I have not seen on previous (and recent) visits. This was also keeping the amount of beggars and annoyances down which was excellent. We saw none of the people asking for signatures on petitions that others were complaining about but if you do see them obviously walk on and don't engage at all - they are set ups for pick pockets and petty thefts."

I was always a fan of Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. After having seen it in person, I wanted to watch the whole movie again and compare the stained glass windows and the gargoyles perched on top of the towers from the actual. There was a long queue and I disliked the fact that you have to pay in order to go up the tower in order to see the breath-taking views of central Paris and the River Seine. We remained outside and watched as the huge Christmas tree was being set-up in front of the Cathedral in time for Christmas. So if you are keen to jump the line and fit enough to climb the steps (over 300 each) of the 2 towers, I suggest you join a tour. Notre-Dame is not just about the towers but also the stained glass windows, 10 ringing bells and the 13th century organ."

Instead, you should listen to my advice, get out of line, and go do something much more enjoyable with your time in Paris. You can always buy postcards with terrific pictures of those gargoyles and the view. This is one Paris experience that is not all it's cracked up to be, unless you are in very good shape and possibly related to Quasimodo...Several times a week, I walk by the line of people waiting to ascend the narrow, winding medieval stone staircase. Many of them have no idea what waits ahead - parents with very small children that will have to be carried up those 387 steps, people who have mobility issues, people with other health issues - and all of these patient people will have a great deal of difficulty managing the climb. Some people - the young, the mountain-climbers, the fortunate few - will be fine, though I never see many of them in line. They're probably off in the Himalayas, or someplace...The line is very long, and so is the wait - because only a certain number of people are allowed inside at any given time. Many stay a long time - taking selfies with the gargoyles and each other, some people need a lot of time to catch their breath, some actually enjoy the view - but all of them must descend before anyone waiting in line can go up. Some people even climb up into the bell tower - not advisable unless you really relish the idea of walking across a thin plank with only piles of pigeon guano to cushion a possible fall. Anyway, you have to wait till all these people decide to come down to Earth, too.What goes up must come down, and a similar set of 387 winding, medieval stone steps is waiting for you on the other side. It's not any easier, going down - especially if you have joint problems which have been aggravated on the upward climb, or have to carry a child who has simply had too much fun for one day...or not.I first climbed the Towers of Notre Dame when I was 40 years old and there was nobody in line. Even though I'm in much better shape, some 20-odd years later, and went up with a friend in September this year, I wouldn't attempt it again. Life is too short, Paris has much more to offer, and all of that can best be experienced without gasping for breath and limping for a week, afterwards.As I mentioned, you can buy photos, postcards, placemats, even statues of the gargoyles - all of which will look better than the photos most people take. There is a display of 3 beautiful bells in the rear garden, so you don't have to risk your life playing Quasimodo. Save your money, save a whole lot of time - go wandering the medieval streets around Notre Dame, instead of going horizontal. You'll have more fun, and when you're lots older, your knees will thank you."

When you visit Notre Dame you must visit the Towers too.You should be there at least 45 min. before the entrance closes,at around 4 o'clock.You have to pay a ticket (about 10 euros) and climb up 387 steps as there is no lift. But when you finally reach the top you will see the wonderful view and feel part of the story ''The hunchback of Notre Dame''!!Don't try to find Quasimodo or Esmeralda..they are well hidden.."

We are in Paris during what is considered to be the off-season, and the lines of tourists are still considerable.The attendants do their best to move people along--there can be something of a bottleneck of people all trying to take pictures of the same things and of one another--so be patient (and, if you're one of those people, try to be thoughtful of the others behind you). The view of the entire city is quite wonderful. Among many other things, you will see Sacre Coeur in the distance, ensuring that you will want to take the trek to Montmartre!"

Make sure you have a large memory card because you'll be snapping away! While I recommend this to everyone, those that are claustrophobic might feel a bit uneasy as the stairs and some walkways are pretty tight (and everyone walks up single-file, so there isn't really room to \"pullover\" if you need a rest). Tips: arrive early because the queues are HUGE! If you need to use the restroom, those located outside ND (down the stairs) are free. There are con artists that will tell you that you need to pay (and they even have a crummy handwritten sign they use to block the turnstile) ~ just walk past and go in. The turnstiles have no coin slots and there is clearly marked signage that these WC's are free."

However - it was worth the wait! The views across Paris were breathtaking. And the gargoyles - wow! There are time restrictions that are loosely in place - you will be moved on from various areas mainly because the next group have been let in and will be climbing the steps of the Towers. However, we seemed to stay for longer than most and no-one bothered us. We are keen photographers, so the gargoyles coupled with the views meant we took our time.Thoroughly enjoyable. Not an experience to miss. We climbed the Eiffel Tower steps the day before\u2026but would still recommend the Notre Dame Towers in addition to this - if you love views, photography, art and Paris\u2026.do both! (Note - Queue for the Towers of Notre-Dame are around the side, opposite the cafe, not the main queue in the square. Old, uneven spiral steps to climb. Not difficult, but good to be aware of this if you have mobility difficulties. Also - your first stop is the ticket desk and shop area - if you want to purchase something, do it straight away as you don't return to the shop area before you leave.)"

The stone outsides and the beautiful stained glass inside. It is a sacred place. Go outside and wait in the line to climb the towers. We waited about an hour, and got to the line about 1 1/2 hours after it opened up. The climb is not difficult, but it is a lot of small, narrow stairs. You go up one set, and down another set, so thankfully there aren't people trying to go both ways on the same staircase. Once you get to the top, the view is beautiful! We had a very clear day, and the view was amazing. And the gargoyles! To be eye-to-eye with the gargoyles is an experience I will never forget. The bells started to ring for Mass while we were up there....it is very jarring! Very noisy, and if you hold onto the stone, you actually feel the vibration. The bells are on the same level as you are, so be prepared! There is a walkway all around the front of Notre Dame. At the bridge between the two towers you can turn around and see the back of the cathedral, equally impressive, and a view of statues, etc, that can't be seen from down on the ground. There is no timing, other than waiting on the line. Once you're up top, you can stay as long as you'd like, but it does get crowded up there. That is why the line is so long a wait; they only let 20 people up at one time, so the line lurches. But it was worth it~!"

You've seen the pictures before: a stone gargoyle sitting with his hands under his chin, pensively looking out over the city of Paris. If you take the Tower tour, you can enjoy his view and that of his numerous stone brethren who adorn and guard the two bell towers of Notre Dame Cathedral.The line will be long at this popular attraction, so I recommend going first thing in the morning on one of your sightseeing days (though I hear the evening sunset is particularly stunning from this vantage if you can work out the timing just right). Check the website for hours as they differ on some days. Despite the seemingly interminable line, my husband and I counted this attraction as one of our favorites in Paris. There are no elevators (of course), so be prepared to climb up (and eventually down) steep, winding stone stairs. Once at the top, you and the rest of the tourists who are let up in groups of a certain number will be free to walk and take pictures of the gargoyles and views. It is crowded up there, but people seem to behave congenially and take pictures for one another. You don't feel too rushed, but the ushers will keep you moving along at a steady pace, so that other visitors can take your place once you leave. There is no audio guide, you just relish in the grotesque beauty of the whimsical stone chimeras and the gorgeous view of Paris spreading out beneath you as you walk along the top of the Cathedral and around the towers.

There are always queues at Notre Dame but don't be put off by the queue to climb the towers, it does take a while to go down as only so many people can be allowed up at once. The queue for the towers is down the side of the cathedral not at the front. There are almost 400 steps up a spiral staircase so you need to be reasonably fit but once at the top the panoramic views are excellent and well worth the climb. There are metal fences at the top which effectively cage you in so it gives an added feeling of security for anyone who is slightly worried about heights."

Even though a lot of brochure said that the Tower of Notre Dame closes at 6:00pm, on the day I visited the tower, they decided to close it earlier at 5:00pm and stopped letting tourists to get into the tower at 3:30pm. Because we couldn't understand a lot of the signs which were in French only, we lined up for the wrong queue and went into the cathedral accidentally. By the time we made it to the tower, it was 3:40pm and yes, the attendant kept yelling at me for getting frustrated of their last minute hour changes. As tourists, we only had limited time in Paris, I think the attendant needed to be more sympathetic to our frustrations. Other than that, we actually asked for help from another attendant earlier when we were looking for the entrance to the tower in the cathedral. We appreciate her help in helping us locate the entrance of the tower but I wish that she could have told me about the last minute change of hours. Then, we would have started lining up at the tower.Overall, I found the attendants at Notre-Dame very insensitive of the need of the tourists."

The small groups are ideal as it doesn't get too crowded up there and you don't feel trapped in the stairwell. The vistas are outstanding, as is the chance to observe some of the architecture and decoration of the cathedral itself. They have a good explanatory pamphlet available in a number of languages.

Instead, they showed a video (I suspect something that is available on You Tube) in which a group of French organists talk about the Notre Dame organ - in French. The video was displayed on some monitors scattered around the church and was also projected on a very inefficient screen across the nave. I don't know how long the video lasted - we left after more than an hour. Clearly not what was promised."

It wasn't!The view that presented itself to us from the top was nothing short of spectacular!We then also realised that the system of letting only a limited number of people up at any one time, in effect leading to the long queue, has a good reason: It eliminates crowds at the top of the tower and allows visitors to have an unobstructed view over the whole of Paris, and without being jostled all the time.Anyone wanting to see the whole of Paris from above and from the very centre of the city, I can only recommend getting in the queue and climbing up the stairs.

There were already 30 some odd people present, but it was nice because the streets were not too busy, and you get a few minutes to enjoy the atmosphere. Be prepared to walk up tiny steps in a narrow and spiral staircase. Bring some good walking shoes and pants/shorts for the ladies if possible (seeing as you can be pretty tight with other visitors in the narrow/steep spiral case) The steps up to the top of the towers are a pretty good workout, but you are provided two short interim stops between. After the first flight of stairs is the organ room, where you get to rest a few minutes and they check your tickets and there is a few souvenirs that can be purchased. Next you continue the stair climb up, and get to the middle deck where you are next to the gargoyles and statues with a wonderful view of the city and the middle spiral tower with the green apostles - you can see the Eiffel tower in the distance, and also the Sacre-Coeur in the horizon. Great for photos. You next head up another rigorous flight of stairs to the top of the Notre-Dame tower, (the steps get more narrow at this point) and get a wonderful view of the city skyline. However, I much preferred the middle level view as you are next to the wonderful gargoyles which gives a wonderful perspective and reminds you of exactly where you are at while looking at the amazing city. When going into the cathedral, we were lucky that service was just starting. Therefore, we were able to see the progression of the priest to the alter and join in to the mass that was taking place. We stayed outside of the main pews (there is seating outside the mass area) so that we could leave shortly after without disturbing those attending the service. The rose windows are amazing - do make sure to also see saint-chapelle (close by) as well as those windows are also wonderful and different in their own right. Wonderfully clean outside as well, it was cleaned up recent years, so you can really appreciate the architecture. Must see and place to go on a trip to Paris. If you have a few minutes to spare, head over to next island to get some ice-cream (the chocolate is absolutely divine!) in the Rue Saint Louis en I'lle, there's a line up leading to a shop on this street."

This quickly disappeared on the very first sighting of this grand lady. i loved that we saw it nearly everyday from different angles: from the bus looking up to the spires, from a boat on the Seine, from the Velib (almost free bike system) on the other side of the river, while eating cup cakes from Berties Cup Cakery (a must visit - try the pink lemonade!), eating chips down by the river, and finally wandering around the church eating ice cream! Inside of course is wonderful too but you will have to queue. TIP: There are two queues - one for the main internal building and one to the left for the spire. If you can it is best to either do each area on separate days or have a break at one of the many cafe's around the area. We came back very early the next day to do the spire before it was too hot and the queues were too long. The views are spectacular. If you can only do one area i suggest the Spires. There are often concerts in the church - but friends have and say they are fantastic!"

So you may stand in line a long time not moving, then all of a sudden move up. Even once you get to one part of the towers, because the space is so small they do it in small groups. So you may wait and wait to get up, you'll get your fill of the views, and then have to wait some more to go all the way to the top. Still, totally worth it - great views of the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, even all the way to La Defense on a clear day, and get up close and personal with the gargoyles."

I am so glad we climbed so many stairs of all 3 tourist attractions as each gave a great different perspective on the beautiful views of Paris! The only downside to this attraction is that we queued 1 hour 15 minutes to pay to go up the towers (there was a separate queue to enter the notre Dame itself - this was free) and all you did was go up the towers - you then had to re queue to enter the cathederal. Unfortunately we did not do this as it had had been a long day for the children. I really believe this is something that the staff at Notre-Dame should maybe look into. If you have paid to enter the attraction and already queued once, the could surely look at possibly giving you fast track enterance to view inside the Notre Dame ???"

I did it, but I must say I had some moments where I got a little claustrophobic, which was unfortunate because once you start up you really just have to continue. Like all old European buildings the stair cases are very steep and narrow with little ventilation, so it can be a little harrowing. However, once you get to the top, the views are great. Be warned, if you do not like tight spaces (or being stuck in them with a wall of people in front of you and behind you), just stick to the Cathedral and skip the tower."

You can see all over Paris and the views of the river Siene were breathtaking. Some things we noticed after the second visit venturing away from the Cathedral (instead of getting back on the bus right away):If you head away from the Siene but still in front of the Cathedral there are a bunch of small restaurants and shops there. We had dinner at a diner that literally had only about six places to sit. They served sandwiches and spirits. Was very nice although I could stand in the middle and touch both walls at the same time. In the front of that same restaurant was a place that sells crepes with nutella and other delectable toppings. There is also the warm wine served on the street. It is literally the best darned thing I ever had. I don't drink, but the boiled wine was not like drinking alcohol.Walk in the other direction and cross the Siene, there are hundreds of shops, restaurants, and bars. Be careful, they have employees in front of some of the restaurants trying to coax you inside. Its ok to politely say no thanks. They have just about any type of food you can think of from Kabobs to Pizza to Chinese food. You could spend an entire night down there. Its amazing, about an hour after dusk it gets quiet for about an hour (still crowds), but then the nightlife wave emerges. Amazing time."

Go about 30 min to an hour before the towers open to wait in line, and expect about a 1-2 hour wait (longer when you go later). They let people climb in batches.

I never knew that they were all different (an eagle, elephant, penguin, lion, etc., as well as the ones that are typically pictured). You are so close you can touch some of them which is really cool!

I must say it is so less up tight than the USA--when we were staying at her grandfather and mothers place in Angers - there was not even a frown that myself and girlfriend were sharing the same bed.

Unfortunately, they were doing repairs so we had to leave and come back. We had the museum pass, but there are no cuts for the museum pass. You can try like we saw many people do, but they'll send you to the end of the line. It only gets access to the top for free.The next day we stopped by around 2p and the line was twice as long as it was the morning before at 9:30.The next day it was raining and 4P. I took a chance that people would be discouraged because of the rain and time. The line was about the same as it was at 9:30 the morning before. I wanted to go up, so we waited 45 minutes. By far, this was the longest we waited for anything in Paris during our trip.I'm not sure there is any way of getting out of a 45+ minute wait. I think it would have to be a minimum based upon our experience and during the summer. Even if you get there at 9:15, the line is shorter, but you are still waiting the 45 minutes.It's a slow moving line because there is only one stair case (as far as I could tell). So they let about 40 people up, they look around and then the people at the top come down. Then the next 40 people go up. Once you get in the church you climb some stairs and get to a gift shop. Make sure you buy what you need (although there wasn't much time) because you don't come back through there.Then you start climbing the 387 steps. I had climbed the Eiffel Tower that morning (669 steps), Sacre Couer that afternoon (lots of steps) and then climbed these 387 steps. My legs were a little tired, but it wasn't a big deal. You can stop to rest if you want, but there isn't a lot of room and people are moving behind you. I don't have a problem with tight spaces, but I noticed it. It made me a little dizzy actually with all the steps in a spiral. You get to the top, but there isn't a lot of room. You basically walk along a pathway among the gargoyles. There isn't some big area to spread out like Arc de Triumph or Eiffel. You walk half the way, then you have to wait for the people who are already up there to go down the steps. Then you walk to the other side of the Cathedral, where you can see people to waiting to go into the cathedral. My husband who is scared of heights, was pretty terrified (more so than on Eiffel or Triumph). I was surprised, I wasn't that scared. Then you wait for your turn to go down. You are up top for about 20 minutes and then you have to come down.Seeing the Gargoyles and architecture up close was really worth it. Very Paris thing to see."

The line moved along slowly and we realized later that people had to go in groups and be synched, time wise, so everyone had the same amout of time at the various levels. We bought our Museum Pass on the first level which consisted of a little gift shop and a seating area. Once the stairwell was cleared we were allowed to go up to the next level. Here we saw the gargoyles and a great view of Paris. We had to wait for the stairwell to be cleared of the group coming down from above until it was our turn to go up. At the top, and you truly were at the top of the tower, you were protected by a cage and allowed to walk around. It was a tight squeeze up there with another group coming up behind us. Going down was pretty seamless. If you might be afraid of walking up 800 year old small steps or might be claustraphobic, this might not be for you. Great view of Paris."

By the time it opened the line went all the way down to the end of the cathedral. We were in the first group that went up that morning. We had the Paris Pass, but there is no line jumping privileges for this. You climb a bit, then you are in the gift shop/ticket office. I wish I would have known that you walk down a separate tower & the only chance you have to purchase anything is before you climb. It was a pretty good shop. We have climbed lots of lighthouses and I would say it is a tougher climb than those. Not many places to pull over and stop. I believe it was 400 steps. Since we were there early it wasn't hot inside the towers. Might be different later in the day. Once at the top you are well rewarded with an amazing view and close ups with the gargoyles. We were up top for about an hour and we got to hear the bells play. You can also climb up to a second higher level on one of the bell towers. They don't do a good job of letting people know to go up to the top of the one bell tower. We were headed down & would have missed it if it wasn't for a couple of teenagers yelling to their parents that they were going up. Well worth the wait. Probably one of my favorite things we did in Paris."

It was a clear, beautiful day and our photos were amazing. Had a bit of a traffic jam at the top because there is only one spiral staircase to go up and down to the very top of the 2nd tower. Gorgeous views of Paris!"

It is really beautiful old church in the grounds around in a really nice and a great place for picnic. Also nearby is the infamous lock bridge where you can lock away your secret loves etc. We had the Paris pass so I'm not sure what this event cost but it did have a special fast pass entrance. We burned the candles at the same station and basically did the audio tour of the church. I think this took about an hour about you could easily spend three or four hours there. We didn't climb to the top by the bell anything like that as a line was ridiculous. "

Our kids were crazy about visiting \"his place\" and seeing the chimera sculptures (hybrid beasts) which could talk in the story and were his best friends up there. While I was waiting in the queue - (about hour and a half) my husband took kids to the other side of the cathedral where is a nice playground... OK, It\u00b4s more than 400 stairs. It depends on how fit your kids are. If they are at least a bit used to walking and trekking they will certainly manage. My older one is 6 and had absolutely no problem. Little one (3) did great job; we helped her a bit in the last quarter. It was fantastic visit, up there is everything greatly fixed, don\u00b4 t need to worry about the safety. :-) but yeah, there was one MAJOR problem. We didn\u00b4t know which exact spot did Frolo in the story fall down from :-)"

We snapped pictures for about 15 minutes, and then there was more waiting until our group was admitted to the top tower. We were on the first level for 45 minutes and I actually started to get a little claustrophobic because we were stuck in a big crowd and couldn't leave.The time limit on the top level is 5 minutes, but by the time we finally got up there we were ready to leave anyway, so we snapped a few more pictures and then left.As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a ton of stairs, and they're all in small winding staircases.

When we arrived, we made directly for the tower line, which is to the left side when you are facing the cathedral. There were maybe 50 people in front of us, and we had about 30 minutes until the 10:00 a.m. opening. They limit the number of visitors to around 10(?), and it seems takes forever to move forward. This is also because there is no real queue along the side of the cathedral, so many people were line-jumping ahead of us. (Beware bus-tour groups, because they have a habit of cutting in line, even if the location does not give them priority. It's just something they are able to do because of the sheer size of the groups. If you are an independent tourist, you will begin to loudly curse tour buses every time you see one approaching in Paris. They can completely ruin your visit and very often do.) Once you finally make it into the 10 or so people allowed inside, you then climb to the first level in a gift shop to buy your tickets, and then you wait again. Unfortunately, when you finally start up, the first person in line on the stairs will stop to take photos on every other step, and it will take you another 15 minutes or so to get to the top. Then, you will be behind the previous 50 or so people who went ahead of you who want to get the perfect photo of a gargoyle. You will have no choice but to wait until they are finished. The views, however, really are splendid. PLEASE NOTE: if you visit the cathedral towers in the morning, the sun will be from behind, throwing all of the gargoyles into deep shadow. So if you are one of the 2.5 billion people who must have the perfect Notre-Dame gargoyle photo, visit in the afternoon or evening. The light will be directly on them."

There is so much detail in everything and is a beautiful church on the inside. The crypt on the outside costs to go underground and see and in my opinion it was a waste of money so do not bother going in. Also, there are girls walking around asking you to sign a sheet of paper and donate to their cause for blind and deaf people. I gave a little change to one girl and the other who was asking my husband to sign acted very ride towards him when he told her he didn't have any money and that I had already given some to the other woman. All in all, it is more than likely that a first timer will always visit the church so go and enjoy it but watch out for the women asking you to sign something... Pretty sure it is a scam"

Many visitors may not realize it, but there are at least 3 lines on any given day to Notre Dame: 1.) a relatively short line to access the interior of the cathedral (free; from the West side of the church);2.) a much longer line (on the North side of the church) to access the towers (tickets purchased at end of line); 3.) an intermediate line to access the towers but for GROUPS ONLY - do not get in this line! As is always the case in Paris, it helps to confirm that you are in the right line (and that you are at the end of it, so you don't start a riot by trying to cut as happened to a German family who refused to budge until the booing grew loud enough - they left to widespread applause). Also: always make sure you carry something for the children to read or play during those long waits to maintain family sanity. The wait is worth it, and in many ways, the wait-to-view ratio is probably more favorable (and less expensive) than the Eiffel Tower. Be prepared to walk, climbing over 400 steps, but there are two levels, so you get to rest a bit, enjoying the first view, then climb all the way to the top to see the climax. The gargoyles are wild and great entertainment for kids tired of waiting. Some of the passageways are quite narrow, so heavier American visitors used to lots of space might feel both claustrophobic and acrophobic at the same time, but it's great exercise! The Paris Pass does not allow you to cut the line, unfortunately."

There is a middle level where you can take pictures of the famous gargoyles and Paris sights. After that, you climb all the way to the top for some amazing views of the Notre Dame rooftops and Paris. They did allow us lots of time to take pictures - we were the last group up. Well worth the long climb up and down the narrow winding stairs."

Once you start, there is no way but up. If you have a Paris Museum Pass, it will cover the cost but it will not let you skip the very long line that builds up early. Only about 20 people are let in at any one time and you have to wait until the previous group is headed out the other side just to get in. The same line is where you wait to buy tickets which are bought at the first stop on the climb. We arrived shortly after it opened and waited about an hour and a half. All that being said, the views from the top are amazing. You can see in all directions and see every major landmark in Paris. You have ample time at the top to take lots of pictures and enjoy the phenomenal views. At the top, the area where you stand is narrow and it will be crowded with just your group. Some of the passageways get very narrow. You end at the very top of the right tower, far above the city. If you are up to it, I would not miss this opportunity. I felt it was more impressive and enjoyable than the Eiffel tower or the Arc de Triomphe but the other two have an elevator."

You may feel like you're waiting a while because they aren't constantly letting people up, they let groups of 10-20 up every 10ish minutes which means you stand around in the same spot in line for about 10 minutes so you feel like you're getting nowhere. Be patient though, the view is spectacular and it's a great experience to see the gargoyles up close with the Paris skyline in the background.There are two levels you climb up to and if they decide it's particularly windy they'll close the top level so check before you get in line that both levels are open. Unfortunately it's the same cost and same wait in line even if the top is closed. Once they make the decision to close the top we noticed the decision often remained for the rest of the day even if the wind died down."

We did this only the last time, but I did not think the wait was really worth it to be honest. The cathedral itself has individual nooks off to the side of the walking path where you can sit, pray, or light a candle. There was many displays inside explaining the past of this building and it is just one of those things you look in amazement once you realize people volunteered their lives to build this entire building. On faith and devout to their religion they built these beautiful architecturally designed buildings from ground up without compensation in most cases. It was just truly worth seeing."

Although a Paris museum pass doesn't allow you to skip the line, it does include the cost of admission.We got in line at about 9:00 am, and there were about 30 people ahead of us. We waited about an hour in total, but by the time we got back down the line was much longer so going early worked out well. You have a limited time to enjoy the view once you get up there, so enjoy it!

            "review": "Cathedral quirkiness: notes and tips on visiting the Towers.. Anyone visiting the cathedral of Notre-Dame will want to carve out a trip to the towers in their itinerary. The entrance is located next to the north tower on the Rue du Cloitre-Notre-Dame; just look for the line of people and get behind the last one. Groups are led in about twenty at a time, and you are ushered up about a hundred stairs to an impressive but enclosed rib-vaulted room. As opposed to the fee-free cathedral, a visit to the towers will cost 8.50 Euro at the time of this writing and is paid at this point. After being allowed to browse the shop for a few minutes the group finally ascends to the lower ledge of the north tower.The Chimera gallery greets you at the top of the stairs and it\u2019s here where the fun begins. A 19th Century creation by Viollet-le-Duc, the group of mythical hybrid beasts, birds, and monsters are just plain cool to look at. There are some nice views to the west of the city as well. After appreciating the stone animals for a few minutes everyone is led to the south tower belfry to the cathedral\u2019s largest bell, then it\u2019s up another flight of stairs to the top of the south tower for panoramic views of the city. After about ten minutes up here it\u2019s about a 400-step descent to the ground and the completion of the visit.In summary, a visit here is worth the time and effort spent. From joining the waiting line to departure at the end was a little over an hour, although certainly longer in the peak season. The uniqueness of the carvings balances out the imposing \u201cGothic-ness\u201d of the cathedral itself and the views of the surroundings are on par with the Eiffel tower. I visited the towers for the first time in 2008 and it was a bit of a mess: a three hour wait, people crashing into each other on the top, a direct ascent with no break, etc. Whoever runs the show here really seems to have smoothed out the process and made it very tourist-friendly. This is all the more impressive when you realize this was done on what has to be one of the world\u2019s most visited attractions. Recommended highly and without reservation.Tips:*As this is a paid attraction with limited visitors attached to one of the world's most visited structures, timing your visit either during the day (get in line early) or seasonally (visit off-peak or shoulder) is key.*If you are visiting in the winter months be sure and dress for warmth. This was by far the coldest I felt in Paris during my four days.*There is a free green pamphlet at the entrance that functions as an excellent tour guide for the visit. This is highly recommended as there is no audio guide available and the attendants along the way function more as sentries and not docents."

Personally, I thought it was very cool and for me it was worth it, after seeing Notre Dame from the ground many times. You get to see the gargoyles up close; and you get to climb up to pretty much the very top of the cathedral! However, at certain times of year, the line for this tower tour may be very long; be sure you have a good estimate of how long the wait will be, before you start. If you get to ND early in the morning and the line is short: highly recommended."

It is hard to but remember they offer a limited view because of the safety caging to keep you from falling or jumping I guess. The be able to get up close to the gargoyles and get some unbelievable photographs makes the climb up the tiny winding stairs worth the trip. So if you are of faint heart because of heights or in bad physical shape this might not be the site for you. However, if you can keep on climbing the stairs and have no worries about people complaining if you take awhile go on go it is worth the stops to catch your breath and let people pass you. Enjoy the view and take the great photos that only come with a little effort not everyone takes."

You get to wait on line for hours (unless you get there at 9am like we did), and then climb 400 steps in a very narrow medieval spiral staircase. My girlfriend was very tolerant! When you get to the top, you get (1).A fabulous view of Paris, and (2) a chance to study the wonderful gargoyles at very close range. In fact, the first one you see is the most famous, the Stryge (Vampire). These gargoyles are trememdously interesting. They were created by the restorer, architect Violet le Duc, from about 1840-1860. They were inspired by the impact of Hugo's Hunchback of Notre Dame (1831) -- except that in 1831, they were no gargoyles. They had all fallen off or been taken off to prevent them from falling. There is an absolutely fascinating book by Michael Camille called The Gargoyles of Notre Dame: The Monsters of Modernity. I realize not everyone has the time to read a book about just one sight in Paris. But if you did read the book,you would never regret it. And you would appreciate visiting the towers been more. An absolutely wonderful experience. We'll worth the wait and the climb. And there is a good patisserie right across from the line, so you won't suffer from malnutrition."

It is a historic Catholic cathedral on the eastern half of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 in the 4th arrondissement of Paris. Construction of cathedral began in the 12th century. It\u2019s one of the largest and most well-known church buildings in the world; one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. It\u2019s a designated world heritage site by UNESCO.Lines to Notre Dame are huge, but they also move pretty quickly. Entrance to the Cathedral itself is free. We paid 3 or 3.50 Euro each to see the Treasury of Notre Dame, which is inside of the Cathedral.Cathedral is beautiful inside and out. I prefer view of the cathedral from the banks of river Seine, not the Tower view that usually put on post cards. Beautiful gardens surround the cathedral. Don\u2019t miss climb to the Towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral. If you are facing cathedral with Towers in front of you, the line to the Towers will be to your left. This line is huge and much slower moving. They allow only 20 people to enter every 10 minutes. There is entrance fee: 8.50 Euro. It took us about 1.5 hours to get to ticket office (2nd floor). Stairs to the top are very narrow, 350 steps, spiral staircase (no lift), but view is definitely worth it. At first you will go to the outer gallery between Towers. Gargoyles and chimeras will surround you. Take another spiral staircase to the upper gallery. The gallery will provide magnificent views of Paris, the Seine, the bridges across the river, Eiffel Tower, etc. Beautiful! Highly recommend."

You have to stand in line at the north side of the building, where you buy your ticket (or show your museum pass), then are admitted to walk up a LOT of steps, only to find you have simply reached the gift shop. You are held at that level until the group ahead of you has cleared the top of the tower, then allowed to proceed up the stairs with your own group (about 25 people at a time). Once again, LOTS of stairs so not for the (literally) faint of heart. You can pause, but since there are not really any designated places for stopping, you are holding up the people behind you when you stop, so you can't linger too long. Then, just when you think your heart will explode from the strain, you emerge from the stairwell onto the gargoyle level, which is really neat. You get to stay there a while, then they herd you toward another stairway where you either descend, or proceed further up to the very top of the tower. But seeing the famed gargoyles up close and personal, combined with the magnificent view of all of Paris, makes it worth it (as well as just being able to say you did it!)."

We stopped at the first level and walked round the really narrow parapet where the gargoyles are, and took in the fantastic views of the city. Then up more spiral steps, even narrower and steeper to the very top, which was stunning! The architecture is incredible and the views are breathtaking even if it did make me feel a bit wobbly!

Despite not being a morning person I loved being up early and seeing the city before all the tourists are around. On this day we arrived at the Towers at 9am and there was no line yet so we wandered right around Notre Dame taking gorgeous photos with no other people in them ( a rarity!). It was just lovely, quite a different atmosphere to the cathedral at that time. By the time we had strolled right around and taken lots of photos and gone to the toilet, there was a short line. We waited for about 30min and were in the 2nd group to go up (would have been in the first but they let a school group go in the first group).First you go up to a ticketing area which also has a gift shop. You dont get to revisit on the way down so if you want a quasimodo doll then buy it before they let you go up. The spiral staircase is tight and steep but not as bad as I was anticipating. The views are amazing. Right across Paris - it was fun to pick out landmarks and thanks to construction cranes at Les Halles we could pinpoint where we were staying as well. Gargoyles up close , touching the 850 year old stonework - this was definitely a highlight of our trip. Unfortunately the bellfry was closed so no seeing the bell but there is plenty else to look at - in every nook and cranny on the rooftops there is a gargoyle or a statue or a clock or a piece of scrollwork. It was amazing to see the Paris from above but there was also so much beauty on the towers themselves. Husband didn't enjoy the heights and he went down but I continued up to the next part where there is a time limit of 5 min and it is in a 'cage' - you can see a bit further and walk around to see out the other side but it's not got quite the same feeling as the lower down level. This was an absolute highlight of our trip - just amazing. Totally recommend. When we got to go up the line had stretched right down the street so when they say go early, they mean it. By the time we got back down to the bottom the area out the front of the cathedral was full of tourists and there was a queue to get into the cathedral, so again, if there is one thing you get up early for in Paris I would say it is this one."

The cathedral itself rises grandly to huge heights fronted by two enormous towers. Less than dependable building techniques of the 13th century necessitated the famous \"flying buttresses\" along the side walls to support the massive structure. They worked - it's still here. Inside the massive cathedral there are all the trappings of an ancient and orderly progression of religious ritual which is still carried on today. A visit here is a \"don't miss\". The people handling has improved so the lines tend to be shorter and move faster than in previous years. Admission remains free but most people leave a small donation."

This is because only about 25 people are allowed into the steps of the towers at a time, and groups are given generous amounts of time up top for photo taking. So the line moves at snail's pace. We arrived at 9:15 AM for the 10 AM opening and were within the first 10 admitted on opening. That was great, significantly limiting our wait. I've heard that going near the end of the towers' opening period works well, too, but I am a bit skeptical re that claim. I recommend going before opening as we did. The climb itself isn't bad, as you can take your time and let others pass as necessary. And the payoff at two levels on the top, including the very top is huge, a vast vista over the western part of Paris. Well worth the time and effort!"

I took some pictures of the I will always treasure. Also some great views of Paris. If you are out of shape, this will be difficult for you. I think this would also be better later in the trip. BRING YOUR CAMERA."

I didn't realize that September was still tourist season in Paris so the line to get to the top and even to get into the Cathedral is huge. I would suggest timing your visit to walk through the Cathedral about an hour before the towers open and then standing in line about a half hour before the gates open. The Cathedral opens its doors at 8 am and the towers open at 10. If you think you'll need more time inside the Cathedral obviously plan accordingly but I would highly recommend being one of the first groups in line for climbing to the tower. They only allow about 20 people in at a time to climb to the top and there are two platforms. If you are claustrophobic, or have health issues that would cause you to be easily winded or pass out, you may have a hard time with the stairs. They are tight and they are circular. The Bell tower section of the Cathedral is closed for the next year or so due to repairs.  The views from the top are some of the best in the city with the Eiffel Tower, Sacre Coure, the Seine, the louvre, and all of the left bank houses visible. When you stand back and look at the construction of this building it is awe inspiring and magnificent!"

At first, you start to climb some steps that lead you to the \"billeterie\", where you buy your ticket for 8 euros. You have to wait there like 10 minutes, then they let you go up. Don't worry people are kind and tell each other how many steps are left. However, there are tiny \"corners\" where you can rest and catch your breath . I didn't feel any claustrophobic or anxiaty while I was climbing. There are windows that light the way up. Once you finish the first tower you arrive to the first viewpoint, where are several gargolyles. you can stay there some time, then you go to the next tower, and finish your way up. You can see almost all Paris, the sacre coeur, the Eiffel Tower, several churches. it is absolutely worth the effort. I would love to go back. Make sure you go on a sunny day."

I much more appreciate climbing through an ancient structure like the cathedral for a view like this than taking an elevator through a high-rise or modern structure to obtain a view of a city. When you consider the tremendous work and labor not to mention the ingenuity to create something like the bell-tower centuries ago, it truly enriches the experience. Especially since this view would be restricted to so few until recent history. We got in line early before it opened and waited...sadly the Paris Pass didn't let us skip the line, but at least the attraction was already paid for. Once the tower opened the line moved quickly so waiting for it to open was the right move - because it was REALLY long when we finished. The views of the Seine and the older parts of Paris are unparalleled. Also it rained the day we planned to go to the Eiffel Tower, so the climb to the top of the bell tower more than made up for not going to the top of the Eiffel."

Once in the tower stairs you follow everyone up the narrow stairs in groups of 20-30. The outside landings are narrow, and hard to pass anyone - so you pretty much play follow the leader. The landings are enclosed in a wire cage (probably to prevent people and things from falling) and so photos have to be taken next to the wires. You are limited to 5 minutes on the upper landing, before following everyone down a second staircase. Not good for rainy days, no room for an umbrella to open, and would most likely be closed due risk of slipping on wet marble stairs. Best views of the city on sunny days!"

The entrance is located off the cathedral square, on 'Avenue du cloitre'. There are no elevators, and people with mobility, cardiac or breathing problems should reconsider. There are over 400 steps to the very top, all of them in a narrow, stone, corkscrew staircase. The staircase is so narrow in places, that one can't overtake the person in front, or that guards have to coordinate the crowds, so that a bunch climb up, while those at the top wait for the 'clear' signal to climb down. There is a break half-way, in a gallery where visitors can view Paris and see the gargoyles and chimeras. This to me, is the best part, the view is impressive (***) and will remind you of Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". Go, if only for this, and if you find yourself too winded, you can climb back down from there. If you want to climb fearlessly on, to the very top of the South Tower, there is an even narrower corkscrew staircase up, with the remaining 200 or so steps. The top affords an amazing view (***) of Paris, rivaled perhaps only by the Eiffel Tower. It consists of a gallery about 4 feet or a little over 1 meter wide that goes around the entire circumference of the bell tower. At the end, you line up, and wait for the guard's signal to go down. You eventually take a different staircase down the south Cathedral and exit at the south west corner. I have been there twice, and both times, I've profited from my jet-lag to get there early. The gates to the Towers open at 9 AM, and people were lining up along Avenue du Cloitre as early as 8:15. I can imagine the crush and confusion when hordes of tourists arrive and jostle with each other. I strongly recommend an early visit, which will allow you to relax and gaze on the city below, just like the gargoyles..."

First the gargoyles - actually more properly called chimeras and grotesques - the tower tour gets you up close to them for those classic photos. They are really nicely detailed and with paris at their (and your) feet, you won't find a better or more unusual view of Paris. There are no guides, but really it's all abut the view. The bad - the queue - but then it's worth the wait, and if you find an overcast day the queues won't be too bad. Indeed an overcast day is probably best for photos as you won't get overly bright highlights - although perhaps sunset photos might give a nicer light. And then there's the view - the second stage of the climb takes you to the top of the towers and you get wonderful views of Paris laid out before you. It's worth taking a long lens as well as a standard 24-70mm so you can pick out highlights. If there is a downside it is the cage-work - presumably to prevent suicides or vandalism - necessitating some reaching out with the camera for some shots. But with Paris staying largely clear of high-rise buildings, Notre Dame towers gets you a birds eye view."

After years of visiting Paris, I finally decided to wait in the 30 minute line (November 2011) and pay the 8.50 euros and see what it is I have been missing. In a word: Breathtaking. Some of the very best views of the east of Paris. Gargoyles, Statues, the bells of the cathedral and all right there at your fingertips. In my opinion, this is a must-do activity. Don't let the line put you off, just do it and you'll be glad."

The church is one of the few things in Paris open before 9 - we arrived at 8am, and walked right on in, no waiting (didn't realize until later in the day that there would be a cue at all!) We exited just before 9, and there were only a few people waiting in the line to climb the towers, so we thought we would go for walk while waiting. When we came back at 9:45, the line was down to the end of the street and around the block, so we decided to return a couple days later. This time we arrived at 9:15 and waited the 45 minutes until it opened. We were still almost 40 people down in the line. However, we got in really quickly. The first set of steps take you up to the gift shop. Then every 10 minutes they let a group from the gift shop start the climb to the first level. The climb was easier than expected. The view on the main level was extraordinary. I'd say the best in Paris. My husband did the second set of stairs to the very top. This set of stairs is the only to the top, so it alternates between people going up and people going down, so time is limited. You can view the bells from the main level most of the time, though they were being repaired during our visit. This is also the best place to check out the gargoyles, who are each very unique upon inspection. This is a MUST SEE for any trip to Paris."

We had tried a couple other times and found the lines too long. This time we got lucky and arrived after a sudden downpour which may have scattered the crowds. The lines are slow for a good reason - they limit the number of people in the tower at one time which means that you have more space to move around when you are on the tower, and it is possible to get some great photographs. They also stay open later on some summer nights which is great."

It's been over 30 years since we were there, and they've added a stop at the mezzanine level that has a little shop. My husband and I had Paris Museum passes but we had to get our two boys tickets at that shop before entering the stairs to the next level of the towers. It was free, but we were caught unawares since that wasn't written anywhere that I've found. There's a nice video on the history of the cathedral while you wait for your turn to go up. It was a bit sad to see the deteriorating state of the stone-- (the gargoyles, chimera and carvings look more melted than 30 years ago) but it's still a breath-taking, must do site."

There's no better reward for climbing an extremely narrow and uneven spiraling staircase than the amazing views of Paris from the top of the Notre Dame. The lines tend to get long around tourist season, but be patient - they allow groups to go up at a time and so once a group leaves the line moves pretty quickly. Keep in mind though that the staircase is extremely narrow and long so it does take a little bit of endurance to make it all the way up there. I went in the summer which was probably not a good idea as the stairs are only moderately ventilated and walking behind a sweaty person the entire way up was definitely no fun for my nose."

Once we were let in, we started the great climb! The stairs were wide at first, but then got a bit more narrow; I would not recommend this if you are particularly claustrophobic. About halfway up, you reached a small gift shop were you purchased your ticket (included in the Paris Museum Pass, free for those under 17 with ID, and 10 euros otherwise) and waited about five more minutes to continue to the top. By the end of the climb, I was a little tired but quickly recovered.The views were spectacular!!! When I went, it was a bit overcast but it was still magnificent! I really enjoyed that you were not only given an excellent view of the city, but also of the top parts of the Cathedral itself. There was plenty of time to take photos and enjoy the view before being given the option to continue to climb a little bit higher or go back down.

The cleaning ladies would show people in line a one euro coin in their hands prompting people to tip them. They misled people to do that but in fact, you don't need to. I saw most people did that (and for what? They did not even give you a paper towel to dry your hand.) there was a sign on the wall said (gratuity/ free) so people were confused.

The top of the Montparnasse Tower and the Eiffel Towers are great for counting square miles, but too high to see what's going on. The Arc de Triomphe has a great view of the Champs-'Elysees, but the ND Tower view is the best because it's high enough to see the city but low enough to see the people. AND it has those awesome gargoyles to frame your views or see up close. On June 5th (Wednesday) I got to the entrance 10 minutes before opening (10 daily) and waited 30 minutes. Later is worse until 430 or so. The early light is better for viewing & photos, so go before 10 AM. Next: If you don't want to take the final south tower climb, which does not add a whole lot, especially if you've looked down from Eifell or Montparnasse, there is NO WAIT to decend from the main viewpoint between the towers. Nobody seems to know this, but the waiting line is for the south tower only, and the guy holding the rope over the exit will let you by if you just point down."

Coincidentally, Notre-Dame is celebrating its 850 years anniversary this year and it was quite crowded even at 3pm. The Cathedral is really quite awesome and the details of the carvings and metal works on the cathedral are really quite out of the world. I joined a local walking tour while in Notre-Dame and the guide, a local Parisian, talked us through the little stories and myths of the Cathedral and even brought us through some of the alleys beside the Cathedral. The visit was both inspiring and humbling. Just beside Notre-Dame, the is a street with quite a number of shops selling souvenirs like scarfs, t-shirts, key chains etc. so you can squeeze in some shopping if necessary. There are also some little cafes that sells hot wine and crepes (with Nutella) out of the windows, interesting option for a quick lunch!"

            "review": "Not a cathedral person, but wow, what a view!. I am of the philosophy that if you have seen one gothic cathedral, you have seen them all. Even though Gothic architecture is to allow more light, I find them dark. But that is just me. It is beautiful and amazing the blood, sweat, tears and years that went into their construction given the time period. I do appreciate that. The angles, gargoyles and plays of light make for wonderful photo opportunities. I don't know if it was temporary or permanent, but there was a structure by the crypt entrance, a walkway and steps/seats in front of the cathedral that took away from the beauty of the outside of the cathedral. What makes this cathedral stand out for me though is the hike up 402 steps to the top of the bell tower. The entrance to the tower is on the left side of the cathedral. The line is long and it will take you an hour or so of standing. They take you up in groups. Get there early, they close at 4pm and close the line sometimes as early as 2:30 depending on how many people are waiting. You hike partially up (I did not count the steps) to an area when you buy your pass to the top. If you have the paris museum pass, you don't have to stop, however, this is a good opportunity to take a little breather before you head up higher. I had the museum pass, but I will admit I stood in line, pretending I needed to buy a ticket just to catch my breath. There are little landing area's every now and then as you hike up. I did take another couple minute breather at one of the landings, but it was not that bad. I imagine though if you have any problems walking up steps or do not do any aerobic exercise ever, this could be very difficult. Once you get to the top it opens up to a beautiful view of the city, all the way around. It can get crowded, but there will be plenty of time and opportunities for pictures, so just take your time and enjoy the view and take as many picutures as you can. It is amazing. There was a group of school children up there when we got there so it was a little more crowded for us, I think. Once we made our way around, there was a staff member that held us up before we could go down the steps, or so I thought. It was a little frustrating there as once you get to that point, you can't move and people were getting a bit too close for comfort and irrational thoughts start running through my mind. This thing has stood the test of time for over 700 years, been through multiple wars, but now I am thinking the weight of the 30 or so people standing there is going to bring it toppling down and we will all crash to our untimely deaths. Here I am safe and sound typing up my review so... no worries. The staff member opened the door for us to go down, or so I thought....nope, more steps up!! We were only on the bottom of the bell tower, you actually climb more steps and walk around the top of the right bell tower. Now I though the view was beautiful before... that was nothing compared to now. You actually are looking down on all the buildings. Simply amazing. It was a very nice sunny day and about 50 degrees. I imagine it can get cold, but it was nice when we were up there. You can see everything. It was a better view than the Eiffel tower, in my opinion. You can even see the locks sparkle on the Pont des Arts bridge, it looks like gold. I would highly recommend the hike to the top for those that can do it. It makes just another gothic cathedral a spectacular memory."

The line does move very slowly, but those with a Museum Pass can bypass the lines.Once you start the climb of 487 steps, the pace was slow and steady. You go up about 100 steps to the gift shop, where you buy your tickets if you don't already have them. Then you start your climb in earnest. It's not too bad, though. You stop at the first balcony and can walk most of the way around the church to enjoy views from all angles (until August, 2013, one side is closed for maintenance :( - too bad!) and take your pictures of the gargoyles up close and personal! There is an opportunity at this point to climb an additional staircase to the very top of the cathedral to catch some breathtaking views!."

The listed closing time is 5:30 I believe, but they started turning people away around 4 PM. They must have turned away 60+ people who wanted to climb the tower but were too late, so make sure this does not happen to you because you will be missing out on an incredible experience.Step 1. The Line. The line is long and no you cannot skip it, but it's worth it! Plus you can go pick up some food from the nearby vendors to make the wait go by quickly!Step 2. The Climb. Long and dizzying, perhaps skip this attraction if you tend to suffer from vertigo because it's a long and winding climb. Still, it's all part of the experience and I actually found the climb to be kind of fun and entertaining.Step 3. Showtime. You wait in line, you climb the stairs, and all the while you are hoping that it'll be worth it. Well, rest assured, it is worth it! To see the gargoyles up close, to see different angles of Notre Dame, and to see Paris sprawled out before you... it's just beautiful! The towers and gargoyles are obviously famous thanks to Victor Hugo (or Disney) and are worth the climb to see up close as it is, but when you add in an unparalleled view of Paris, climbing the Towers of Notre Dame becomes an absolute must! Being atop the towers, taking in the views with my fianc\u00e9e was one of my favorite moments in Paris. It was very, very special and I encourage everyone to climb the towers and take in Paris from this magnificent vantage point!"

Notre Dame lives up to its legendary, iconic stature\u2014and there\u2019s no better way to feel like you are actually a part of the cathedral\u2019s legend than by taking the climb up its famous towers. Here, at the top of the cathedral towers, with Paris spread around the island in all directions, you can almost feel the pulse of the cathedral\u2019s heart and soul beneath your feet. It\u2019s easy to imagine the centuries of populations, architecture and history growing out from the very spot where you stand. The sense of history and spirit on top of the towers vastly surpasses the climb up any other Parisian monument (excluding the Eiffel Tower, of course). Not only will you have a stunning view of the city, but also access to the church\u2019s bells (think Quasimodo from HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME) and you will be able to pet the gargoyles that line the cathedral. The climb is not easy (402 steps), but if you do take the challenge, halfway up there is a convenient giftshop where you can catch your breath and buy a souvenir. The climb down has no such rest-stop. Just take your time and be careful on the stairs. TIP: The line to climb the Notre Dame Towers can get long during any and all seasons. Start lining up perhaps 10 minutes before the towers open, which will give you sufficient time to take pictures of the cathedral while in line and beat the crowds. Besides, the morning view from the towers is likely the best! Also, beware of gypsies since many aim to scam the line-up of tourists here."

After two days of stunning Autumn weather, the day had dawned with a thick fog shrouding the city. I had intended joining/starting the queue at 9am to get up there early but decided to wait to see if the fog lifted. I queued for around 45 minutes (while people kept pushing in to the queue...that is very annoying and something that happens everywhere!) I followed the instructions to have the correct change 8 E 50 (although when you finally get in there, you can get change from the cashier or even use a credit card!) The whole church is amazing, but taking the time to climb the towers is a must. The first flight of stairs is interesting, and then you pop out in to the foyer which is a stunning room with a soaring Gothic ceiling and huge paintings on the walls. This is where you buy your tickets and contains the gift shop. Buy something now if you want it, because you don't come back to this room. Then you are herded up the stairs. They get tighter and narrower as you near the top, but the walk and the claustrophobia is worth it for the VIEW! (having said that, it would not be good for someone who is large in size, very narrow passages. There is NO access for prams, buggy's or wheelchairs of any description). Paris is such a low-rise city and this view gives you a brilliant overview of the city. It is all one-way, and sadly I missed the east view. Be sure to turn left before heading west (towards the Eiffel Tower). I could have stayed here all day, but they do keep you moving and only allow each group 5 minutes at the summit. Definately a must-see, even for someone who has visited Paris many times. This was my 5th visit and the only time I have ever done this so I was very glad I finally did! If you only have 1 day in Paris, do this!"

The Towers of the Notre Dame Cathedral are a must see attraction when visiting Paris as the views of the city and the view of the Cathedrals \u201cbackside\u201d are spectacular. The line to climb the 400 plus step to the top are on the left side of the Cathedral if you are standing in front looking at the main entrance. We (my wife and another couple) got in line at about 9:30 AM, 30 minutes before it opened, and only had to wait a few minutes once the doors opened up. Our Paris Museum Pass allowed us to get in for free (but it does not allow you to skip the line).The walk up the small spiral staircase is a big workout but the awesome views make it worthwhile. It\u2019s a tough workout as there are not many places you can stop and rest and the folks behind you are right on your heels motivating you to keep going. My 74 year old in-laws decided to stay behind while we \u201cyoungsters\u201d made the climb. This was a good choice as they would have struggled. Since the stairway is a tight spiral you get a little dizzy climbing up and then back down.After climbing the stairs you are rewarded with a fantastic 360 degree view of Paris. In addition you get a close up view of the Cathedral\u2019s flying buttresses, cool Gargoyles, and the spires and roof. Each Gargoyle looked unique and I am not sure if any two are the same. Once on top you can enter a small door and see the giant bourdon bell (named Emmanuel). This bell is very interesting as it is massive. I was hoping someone would ring it while we were up there but that did not happen (don\u2019t miss seeing the bell). Once you get to the top you are led to an outdoor walking area where you can walk all around and see most of Paris. I felt perfectly safe on top as there is a railing and a high protective wire fence to keep you from falling off. The outdoor walking area is very narrow around some of the corners so if you are big boned you will have trouble getting through.The Towers are awesome and I highly recommend that you climb to the top if you are visiting Paris (but get in line before it opens or you will have to wait a long time)."

My boyfriend and i stood in the queue to climb the towers for over an hour, however, there was restaurants who sold take-away pasta dishes, so i ate that as we waited, which was delicious. As we were waiting there was a street performer who had a mask on that followed passers by, either scaring them or making them laugh. This was very enjoyable as it took your mind off the long wait, especially without a seat. As my boyfriend and i were under 25 at the time we got in with a discount which was fantastic. Only small groups can be taken at a time, for safety measures i would believe. At first you are taken to the gift shop, which you would think normally would be at the end. After a 5 minute wait you then head upstairs. The stairs are very small, narrow and can be a little uneasy as you are going round and around which can make you feel a little dizzy. As you get to the main middle part of the Notre Dame, it is an absolutely breath-taking view of Paris. To your right you can see the Sacre Couer, it was all very exciting. I did feel quite frightened though as you are so high up and there is so little space to move. If you are a large person you will NOT fit through the space you are supposed to walk to get to the other side. I was so surpirsed at how tiny it was and close to the edge. I was really happy standing in the middle as i got to stick my headphones in and listen to 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' soundtrack song, 'Out There' which made the trip up there worthwhile. You also get to see Belfry the bell and then you head up to the smaller towers. As i got to the top i felt it was too much, it was too small and high up that i couldn't go round it and stand, however the brief look of the views were fantastic. The trip down seemed quicker than going up, but again, continuously going down those stairs can make you dizzy so be careful.I would strongly recommend people who are afraid of heights, have vertigo and people who are on the larger side, DO NOT VISIT, otherwise, it is definitely something spectacular that you should visit in your lifetime."

Those who are not so fit and especially obese people will find it hard as the spiral stair case gets narrower and narrower as you get towards the top."

Do not hesitate to spend more than one hour there, you will not regret it. Take time to have a picture of the towers ans the archs outside before to go inside where you will descover the most beautiful ''vitraux'' that I ever seen. NDP is wheelchair frendly."

I wouldn't have done it, except my son's favorite movie of late is Disney's Hunchback of Notra Dame and I think he was convinced that Quasimodo would be there. The line took considerably linger than it takes to watch the movie, but, admittedly, it was very cool. The gargoyles up close are really quite gruesome and suggest a lot about the beliefs in the middle ages. And I kept thinking about how we were standing atop what is a tall building today and must have been an enormous building -- indeed probably the tallest building in the world-- a thousand years ago. My son didn't see Quasimodo (he was apparently on holidays in Ibiza) but we had a great time anyway. Just try and figure out how to avoid that line. Go early, or in the rain, or pay someone to stand there for you..."

A queue had built up but it wasn't that long, we waited 20 minutes before we entered the towers. The admission to the towers is very well managed, they let in small batches of c 20 people at a time. They have staff posted at various points along the tour to make sure there are not too many people in any one section. You are not rushed though, after we got in we spent about 40 to 50 minutes on the tour,The views are super and there is the opportunity to view the largest of the bells. A great trip for photographers. We enjoyed the towers more than the interior of the cathedral itself."

The queue is pretty long as they only allowed about 20 person to enter each time to avoid congestion at the top, but do not let the queue deters you from going up. When you are on top, you can see Paris from a different angle, the very unique (and Gothic) architecture of the Cathedral, and viewing the infamous gargoyles up close, as well as the bell of Notre-Dame."
