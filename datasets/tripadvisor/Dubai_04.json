The large area is enclosed and Arabian Oryx, Arabian Gazelle and Sand Gazelle have been introduced and they are increasing. The first two are easily seen during the cooler parts of the day. The temperature during the day reached 44 degrees. Facilities included guided walks, safaris, hair raising dune drives outside the conservation area and falconry. The restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful. The evening meal from a wide menu was five courses. The suites were scattered in the shrub lined dunes. Suites one and two are quite a distance from the restaurant but just telephone for a buggy and it soon arrives. Suite to accommodates at least five people. The suite is air conditioned, cleaned every day and the beds are made up whilst you take your evening meal. There is a small swimming pool at the front and birds and animals come for a drink if the surroundings are quiet."

In the midst of this man-made city in the sand-pit, who knew there'd be a wild life conservatory!I'd been to the desert before, but I didn't know I'd been tot he Red Desert, which has brilliant red sand but no signs of life.In the conservatory, the sand is a dull tan color but there are animals in exchange! I saw little gazelle, ibex, goats, camel, sand lizards, snakes, and even little bugs.Go here on a desert safari with your kids and have a great time seeing what little wild life and nature that Dubai has."

She was so right, if you get motion sickness take the drug! I was in a car with someone who got really sick and it was rough. At the end you will complete the tour with a true arabian desert meal complete with entertainment and henna tattooing if that's what you want. This was truly enjoyable. :)"

After enjoying a day amidst the desert, you get a ride back to your home.Overall a must do experience, being in the middle of a desert. We were far away from any civilization. Ensure you choose a reputed tour group for the best experience."

Had to put quotes around that because it was a stationary tourist camp (Bedouin's are nomadic). Still had a great dinner and entertainment with belly dancers and a nice traditional male dancer. Great experience."

If you are a sheesa lover then they are sure to disappoint you. It will choke the hell outta your threat with its red hot base. The buffet has both veg and non veg.

One day activity, they pick you up from the hotel in the afternoon around 16:30, since we were there during the summer they go later because of the sun and the heat, and the drive was about 45 minutes to the reservation from Dubai centre. The cars are really good and big so there is enough room and the ride was special. Really gumpy and hot, a lot of people had to take breaks due to nasuea but it was fun. Didnt go that fast tho and the drivers could be more aggressive in their driving but still it was a experience. In the evening they stopped at a big tent were we could sand board (not worth it unless you like soar muscles from running in sand) camel riding, holding falcons, barbeque, shisha, henna and belly dancing. It wss a nice evening and I would recommend you to try this."

The best time in the Emirates is from October to March; the summer is terrible hot and the climate in Abu Dhabi CIty and in Dubai city is terrible humid, because of the evaporization of the water in the Arabian Gulf.

If you are going outing in Dubai and do not go for Desert Safari, you have missed some thing.Here is the trip advice and experience for you.When you travel there go in a team of 4 or more. So that the package will be less costly and can be shared. Carry some snacks with you for time pass on travel or during belly dance.The price of desert safari starts around 60AED per person. There will be other price also but 60 AED is worth it. You will need to travel to the spot on your own or with a tour package. The cost usually includes the Dune bashing , Camel ride and belly dance. A high cost ticket gives you a luxurious SUV like hammer. But dont worry even least you will get Land cruiser with the starting price. It will be a roller coaster ride and you will love it. It is totally safe and exciting. in evening you will have to watch belly dance and tamura dance or even a magic show. This is an hour or little more event followed by dinner buffet.Contact your tourist for a sky diving price in case if you are willing to afford."

We chose to do the tour in the enclosed Mercedes SUV, but you can also do it in one of the big open top vehicles...I live here, so I've had my fill of dust, sand and blazing sun.First they tie your headscarf on, which is a cool if touristy little touch. Then we went to see the falconer. The one the day we were there was a lovely South African lady who really knows her stuff. You get a chance to actually get up close and personal with three different breeds of falcons, which she will handle and feed while she tells you all about the fascinating history of the falcon in the UAE. I knew falcons were important here, but I never really understood why or how they were used until this trip. Very informative. The highlight of this portion of the visit to me was the owl that this handler had with her. What an amazingly beautiful bird!Then we went to a different area for a short camel ride. I've ridden camels before and it's always a fun thing to do. Both of us that were on this trip are horse people. But if you think riding a camel is anything like riding a horse, think again! It is a really different experience! The camels themselves are really gorgeous animals...very stoic and regal and simply HUGE!They then took us to a \"majlis\"-type area and gave us a snack and cold drink (or coffee, your choice), which was a nice touch. Then you drove out into the dunes to search for the Oryx. We saw several of them, as well as a small Arabian deer.Overall a nice way to spend an afternoon and well worth the trip."

I wish to add here a special mention the way he handled the car once when it got stuck on the dunes at an very awkward angle. Imagine he is Persuing his MBA at the same time and taking care of his family. I highly recommend him guys when your doing a desert safari there. You can pickup his details from J W Marriott marquis who I also thank for putting us with him. God bless him and his family."

We got picked up and driven to the desert which took about an hour from our hotel (a little pit stop at a small shop where we could buy water, snacks and use the bathroom). My friends got head wraps, but I wouldn't say they are entirely necessary. It's up to you if you want to pay for one. I suppose it adds to the desert experience! The dune bashing was unbelievable. I feared for my life and couldn't stop laughing and whooping the whole time. It was like a perilous rollercoaster. You go in a parade of about 6 jeeps, so you can see the ones in front of you sliding all over the place which adds to the fear. It was awesome. Keep your seatbelt on for sure, hold on tight and don't have any windows open. Some drivers are more daring than others, so be prepared for some reckless moves. The desert was beautiful, though and after much bashing we stopped to take photos and absorb our surroundings. Another tip- wear shoes that don't allow much sand in. When we arrived at the BBQ, we were welcome to enjoy an hour of camel riding, henna, buy souvenirs and shisha (you could pay to have it at your table). We were then promptly served starters, mains and dessert plus soft drink. The food was SO GOOD! I piled my plate high and was very satisfied by what i ate. There was plenty for everybody and there were a good few of us. The performances were also amazing- a fire dancer, a spinning man and belly dancer really got the evening going. They were great to watch. I would recommend this to anyone. It's definitely value for money- it included a lot of things and we all had such an enjoyable day."

As far as the eye can see, its all sand dunes. I felt out of this world. As much as I enjoyed it I became very dizzy after 15 mins. But it was worth it. We took a 10 min video from the front seat and had it uploaded to Youtube. The second part of the tour for me was a bit disappointing. After the duning they took us to a man made desert camp. It was the attitude and the way they ran the camp. They always try to get people to spend more for various things. We were treated like cattle herds during the buffet dinner. They told people to hurry and move along the queue lines. So we had to quickly take our food and move along. A lady asked us if we would like to have the VIP table which meant a proper seating table and food would be brought to us during the shows and before everyone gets to eat. The charge was 150 USD for my husband and I and our two small children. Later she reduced to a 100 USD. She said the queue would be very long. We declined and later when dinner started there we three queue lines and the wait was not long and line moved quite fast. The shows were good. I wish dinner started earlier instead of about 7.30pm or past that."

Then had beautiful barbecue in a camp in the desert - first class food, loads of it and soft drinks are free. Entertainment is average though (the ubiquitous belly dancer etc).

It was about a 45 mins drive to the Reserve and we were given a running commentary by our driver Paulo along the way. We hopped off the air-conditioned MPV to a land rover, an option we have chosen.The alternative is to ride on a camel. It took another hour or so driving in the desert to reach the camp in the Reserve. Along the way, Paulo stopped at various scenic spots in the desert for photo opportunity. Bringing a camera is a must. We saw some wild life and rare desert plants and Paulo provided a detailed description and conservation efforts to keep them.On reaching the camp,it was almost pitch dark and the temperature cooled down quite a bit from the 40 C plus during the ride in the desert. We were given a tour of the camp and the traditional cooking facilities. Some local entertainment were arranged before dinner. The dinner was amazingly good and tasty with lamb cooked in the traditional Bedouin style, in a hole in the ground and other middle eastern cuisines, It was the first time we drank camel's milk and it tasted like skim cow's milk. The tour was very well organised, the drivers and staff at the Reserve were friendly and helpful and a great meal. Overall, a great adventure not to be missed. In particular, thank you Paulo for being such a friendly and knowledgeable driver/guide."

The Arabian oryx and gazelle are plentiful, but there's not much else to see. When the Arabian wolf is introduced (imminently), the whole ecosystem will become something much more exciting, with the animals behaving more like the wild animals they effectively are, rather than the pampered zoo creatures they think they are. With the wolves will come a greater presence of vultures, sand fox, rodents, and an all-round better conservation reserve. Then this will be a place perfect for expeditions and ethical camping holidays. In the meantime, if you don't know much about the desert environment, it's not a bad place to begin your learning."

A stop to view or purchase your own ATV desert ride, buy refreshments, and use washrooms, gave the driver time to lower the tire pressure in the vehicle so it was ready for the dune ride.With the music cranked up we slid, slided, and rode the dunes for about twenty minutes -- exciting and not for the faint of heart or back.

The more he squealed for joy as the driver of our jeep style 4 by 4 went up and down the sand dunes the more the driver chose to go up and down them. Nana was not as keen. The heat of the desert was like that of an oven. ( May ) The food provided at the camp was lovely ,very authentic and so was the whole experience but be aware you are sitting on very hard cushions and rugs on the floor. Maybe not as exciting for pensioners like ourselves. A great experience and one I will never forget but a one off for me!"

He was driving carefully, but still with a fun :) and constantly was asking if we are ok. driver said that some times people are feeling sick while driving in the desert, but we were fine and really enjoyed it. There was enough stops to take pictures were noting else is visible just a sand :) we really had enough time and the was no rush at all, so we felt relaxed and happy to experience it. The evening program was quit good and the diner was great (they served some alcohol) - eat what you want and as much as you want. really amazing experience and I would repeat it again and again. still unbelievable how the people survived in the sand and how did they found the way, as there is nothing just a sea of sand :)"

We hope that this shall not be allowed in the National Park."

The camel owners would put 2 rider on each camel and have them walk about a couple of hundred yards and back again, then let the riders off and do it all over again with out any rest. In some cases the 2 riders would be 400 lbs & more. You could see the camels struggling and being over worked."

I couldn't stop the wife and kids screaming through the near-vertical drops, side-swings, crest rides, etc. It was really fun and different.The food at the camp met basic expectations, considering the venue and how far it from 'civilization'. a buffet in the desert is an experience.we had some star gazing moments where one comes in touch with nature, and wonder at the majestic creation of God, and his awesomeness (for those who believe). You cannot but realize how small you are in comparison to this great creation, and why you cannot afford to live without acknowledging the existence and rights of the next person.A bit disappointing was the belly dancer; just one girl swinging her hips through the session. It was nice at the start, but quickly became mono-tonous. I guess they could introduce some more excitement here.Overall, great experience, I will certainly want to do this again, though I am sure my spouse has had her fill already."

We started off by being picked up from our cruise ship. we had been warned to avoid the back seat in the 4wd as there wouldn't be to much leg room. Guess where we ended up in the back seats, but we were ok with them. Leg room was ok, but my issue at nearly 6 foot was no where to put my feet and getting in and out wasn't easy.Once at the reserve they took you to see some hawks being flown where free soft drinks were provided, and then off you went to the roller-coaster drive through the desert.You couldn't have been throne around more in your vehicle, it was a unique experience, but make sure you hold on tight.They do stop a couple of times for you where you can get out and take photos. Unfortunately if you are at the back of the convoy like we were there is no way you can get a photo without people in it as all the other people have been at the location for a while before you, and very soon after you get there they start calling you back.We were on the sunset trip so at the stop to see the sunset you had to walk to the top of next dune to avoid people in your photos and then when you got to that dune you found someone on the next one in you way and so on. After about 4 dunes you finally got a view with nobody in it. Why these people couldn't have stopped at the first dune which meant we all got a view with nobody in it I don't know.After the sunset we were taken to a camp, where you got to experience more of the local life, camels rides, sand surfing, henna tattoos, food, drinks, pipe smoking, belly dancing, and finished off with them switching off the lights so you could see the stars.A great all round experience, and you get to bring some of the desert home with you with all of the sand in your shoes."

I believe there are only a couple of companies that are licensed to take visitors into the reserve and the trip I was on went out in old Land Rovers. That suited me fine because I didn't like the idea of the dune bashing that appears to be done in modern 4x4 vehicles. The Land Rover trip was slower but, having been trained to drive cross-country in a Land Rover, I wasn't convinced that the driver really knew what he was doing. On the up side, we saw many Arabian Oryx and the views across the desert were stunning.The tour finished at a recreated Bedouin camp with Arabic food and drink.

We then got beached on a sand dune and was towed off very very harshly by another car with no warning at all. I'm surprised my girlfriend didn't get whiplash as she nearly headbutted the seat in front of her. All in all, pretty horrifying and dangerous. I would typically like something like this but this guy was an idiot and didn't have a care in the world - speeding while texting on his phone, barely holding the wheel, blaring his music...

If this is a first time for you to a Middle-Eastern country, then the desert safari is definitely a must-do. There are numerous companies offering different packages. Cheaper ones will have shorter trips. The package normally includes dune bashing, a stop-over to enjoy the sunset over the dunes, a camp site buffet dinner and belly dancer, swirling dancer, camel rides and henna painting. Some also offers ATV rides (included in package or additional price). Pick up is usually arranged from your hotel if you are staying in Dubai. They have early morning runs or evening runs. For evening runs, which is best in my view, they will usually pick you up at about 5.30 to 6.00pm (or earlier). Sometimes, the picking up of different guests from so many different hotels, can take a long time. To avoid this, try to go in a group from the same hotel.Over the times that I have been on the dessert safari, I find that the driver makes the biggest difference. Sometimes, when you are lucky, you get a driver that is very knowledgeable and shares a lot of interesting information with you. Sometimes, if you are unlucky you get one that is inexperienced, i.e. you get stuck in the dunes and it takes time to get out of it, at the same time, they are very quiet and just drive (suspect this is because they can\u2019t converse well in English). Most of the time the \u2018nothing to write home about\u2019 buffet dinner will consist of barbequed meat and pseudo-traditional fares. Something that I found really weird was that most of the belly dancers were not Arab, they are usually Russian or Brazilian and other non-Arabs. Just to share also that one time, we had a belly dancer that was actually rather fat (nothing against fat people here), it is just that it was not something you would expect of a belly dancer.Tips: 1. Avoid Fridays and Saturdays, as it gets too crowded. 2. Do not have any heavy food before taking the desert safari. 3. Best time to go is during winter months \u2013 much more comfortable and enjoyable. 4. Also for safety reasons, best to exclude children below nine years old, to my opinion."

We camp quite a bit as we live here and only need to travel a short way from home to set up tent in the dunes. Your experience will really depend on the company you go with. It has gone from being a luxury trip out at around 100 pounds per person to numerous companies now offering the trip at very competitive rates - 2 for 1 vouchers are in the Entertainer Book/App. If you go expensive there will be a longer drive - check how long - and fewer people. Avoid Fridays they are busy plus you have all us expats and locals out in the dunes too as Fridays is our day off. We tend to keep away from the tourist though if camping. If you are opting for a morning drive get sunrise - early start but worth it and it is often in the morning after a nights camping that we will see oryx and gazelle wandering across the desert. Camels are pretty easy to time as they will go into the farm for breakfast so you can see them heading across the dunes. All the camels you will see are female and they are tethered so they dont bolt off. Camels down Shk Zayed road would not be conducive to health and safety these days but they did used to roam around the city freely and we often found them in the school playground or just stood in the middle of the road.The usual tour will be a short drive - again health and safety measures are in place and these drivers are under strict rules as to where they can and cannot take you and how far up a dune they can go etc.. not in the old days when bashed up tour cars used to be brought back in the dead of night under tarpaulin so as not to put off business. A stop for sunset and photos and a soft drink is usually on offer followed by the camp site with camel rides, henna painting, belly dancing and the buffet. The more expensive ones will have all these costs covered - check the cheaper ones and what they include.You will have to wait until everybody in your car is ready to leave so you cant decide to just go when you want unless of course you have a car full of guests then pretty much the driver will go when you are ready. The camp is deceptively close to the road so only track on the way out - no dunes - and that is a good thing - nobody wants to be travelling through the dunes at night.It is a great trip - yes a bit touristy these days but if you are here then its simply a must do"

I didn't know that a 4WD can be used as a \"roller coaster\" on the sand too! Our driver, Sulaiman from Hormuz Village, is an experience driver and it was beyond thrilling to be in his car. He sped up at the edge of a hill and just drop at the cliff and the car just roll down. I don't think anyone have such driving experience unless you drive through a desert everyday to go to work. I was warned not to roll down the window nor puke in the car without a plastic bag. I was definitely trying to hold myself together not to puke. At the Hormuz Village, we get to go on camel rides, ATV rides, sand board, tried out hanna tattoo and even smoke Shisha (smoke pipes). Some of the rides, we do need to pay but most of it is already in the package. We went with a tour group hence everything has been paid for. Else you can contact Hormuz Village for arrangement. I met a German girl who was there alone and she booked it through the internet. It sounds pretty easy. Our dinner was buffet and some BBQ meat. It was just so-so.

The SUV ride was fairly short with longer \"Photo op\" stops, the falcon demonstration was short and fairly bland, the camel ride was about 100 metres, the food was not genuine bedouin food and the photo booths in the camp were too remindful of those available on cruise ships - for an exorbitant price. The entire staff are foreigners, as in non-native UAE nationals, and even the belly dancer is from Brazil. Hardly an authentic Arabian experience.True, it's a good way to see the desert. But the whole experience has been really too commercialized to maximize tourist dollar expenditures."

We booked at the hotel and were collected from there. An hours drive and you arrive, you are taken into the reserve and stop at a small tree'd area to see a falcon show. Then onto the exciting bit, 4x4 over the dunes. The tour stops for photos at sunset, which are spectacular. Please do take a jumper or cardigan as once the sun goes the desert is really quite cold.You are then driven to the camp, where a lovely 3 course self serve meal is provided. They do serve wine and beer as well as soft drinks. Camel rides are available and photos with a falcon. You can have henna tattoos done all included in the price. There is a show after the food and the belly dancer entertains with skill and sass! Before you leave they invite you to star gaze and switch off all the lights, that is quite spectacular.Highly recommend this, approx GBP 60 per person, but worth it. The trip is about 6 hours in total 3pm - 9pm."

We went with Arabian Adventures in a 4-wheel drive land cruiser that was ideal for driving off-road on the dunes. Be warned that the dune driving can be uncomfortable and I would not recommend it if you suffer motion sickness. On our visit we encountered gazelle, were able to sample the delights of fresh dates and had a brief camel ride. Another trip on offer is a sunset supper and if you have never seen the desert at night it is something I would recommend. Our trip was just for half day and our driver, who was from Pakistan, was excellent."

They charged us AED 300 which included a buggy ride on the sand dunes, camel ride, activities and dinner in a camp - including belly dance, tanu dance, BBQ dinner, pics in the local dress, and other activities. It was quite a different experience. Dinner was good, a delight for the non-vegetarians. The dances were amazing, the rides on the sand dunes was super fun. The driver was good, the rides were smooth and fun. we watched sunset in the sand dunes - very picturous. Overall a great experience. Various tours charge different rates for the different categories of the safari, I was very happy with what we got for AED 300.Would definitely recommend that visitors experience the desert safari. It was a highlight of my trip."

On the drive to pick up the other passengers he did a little site seeing telling us some of the places we were passing.The overall experience of riding the dooms was fun. If you love rollercoasters then you will certainly love this ride.We took a break right at sunset to watch the sunset and give our stomachs a chance to relax. I am not going to pretend I wasn't glad that we stopped when we did. I was starting to feel a little ill by this time. After watching the Sunset (almost set) we set off to the camp where we had dinner and a show. It was a few companies there but we had a table setup for our group and it was a good show. The buffet style dinner was a bit of a letdown due to the long lines and the average food that was served.But overall it was a great experience and if you have time and are in Dubai I would recommend doing this trip. But always checkout the company you pick online reviews. We used Funtours a good rating online and about average price and the fact they were on Groupon."

We requested the supplier Zafar to change the pick up from Hotel to Miracle Garden which he agreed upon. A Land Cruiser with driver name Prajeesh was provided to us. Driver took us to a resort near the desert and asked us to take a rest for an hour before he took us to main desert and camp area. There were desert scooter operating and people were taking a ride there. After that driver took us to camp area the route to the camp area is through dense desert. The ride took about 40 minutes out of which about 35 minutes were in desert with car providing a nice roller coaster ride on sand dunes. It is one experience which should never be missed. The kids and adults equally enjoyed the ride. We arrived at the camp area where free camel ride for photography was provided to guests. The food and soft drinks were included in desert safari price. The food though not great but was still ok types. There were variety of Salads on offer with Some rice and Dal and Curries. We did not had food there as kids did not liked the look of food. There was Arabic and Belly Dance as entertainment.The high point of the attraction is Car zipping on sand dunes. Once in a lifetime experience."

We left hotel at around 3 pm and reached desert at around 430 pm after picking up others from different locations.It was an excellent drive through the desert during the dune bashing time with going up and down the dunes giving a feel like a roller coaster ride. Our driver was very nice and he even raced other vehicles in the desert with comfort which gave us a more thrilling ride. We stopped at a place for sunset photography.Following our dune bashing, we went to a place for dinner in the middle of the desert. We had a small camel ride which was fun too. Buffet dinner was nice with barbeque and a variety of Indian dishes as well. We had a couple of shows (belly dance, etc.).It was a nice experience in the desert. Had a lot of fun. Highly recommend desert safari to anyone who visit Dubai."

Peaceful, unspoilt, seemingly endless rolling red sand and a healthy spattering of Arabian Orynx, Gazelle and birds.You can't just drive into the Reserve though, you need a valid reason to be there, like a day trip or overnight stay at the Al Maha Desert Resort, a stay with Platinum Heritage, a trip with Arabian Adventures, or a Falconry experience with Royal Shaheen. Before you ask, we're not employed by any of these - but we are extremely pleased to have this desert beauty on our doorstep."

For a first timer, simply expect to be driven up/down and around the desert, watch a lady tell you a brief story about the history of falconry, the show allows the Falcon to only make 2 flights that are super quick, have a buffet in the desert at night, camel ride, eat, watch a belly dancer. Free food and drinks once at the compound. Food/beer/wine is the same each time. Will not do this a 3rd time"

The Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve was a relaxing get-away after spending several days in the city of skyscrapers, huge malls, and staggering amounts of sightseeing. The sand dunes are beautiful, especially as the sun was setting. We did see wildlife, both at the feeding station which allows for good close-up photos and just running amongst the desert foliage. The cultural dinner, entertainment and the camel ride (go around in a circle ) are fun and well done. If I were to do it again, I'd opt for the camel ride outside the reserve fence for a different experience."

Four wheel drive over the dunes is good for first 5 minutes. You see some antelopes, but not much else. The best part of the trip was the small camel farm just outside the centre. Overall we thought the morning was bad value, and we should have gone shopping or stayed around the pool."

We watched falcon flying, went 4x4 driving (we are Aussies who own 4x4's back home and go constantly 4x4 driving and still enjoyed this experience), watched the sunset, rode camels and spent time in a absolutely wonderful desert camp. They turned the lights off in camp to see the sky, and coming from Australia we are used to beautiful nighttime star gazing and this was easily equal to that. Loved everything....."

But be careful do not each much just before heading for the bumpy ride, you could end up in nausea and vomiting (like the other couple who we shared the car with). You can click some amazing photos and enjoy a good evening the arabic style with some awesome dance performances. I give thid tour a 3 rating because : 1. Though its called the desert conservation park, you can see litter around! 2. the food at the camp was horrible with limited veg options 3. Its quite commercialized and touristy place, so if you are looking for a natural experience of the desert or some off-beat things to do in Dubai, you should strike this off."

Sinbad, Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, 1001 Arabian Nights are all tales made us dream of our own Arabian Nights adventure. The adventure that most may think of when coming to Arabia is to live like the Bedouins; in the desert and a tent, living with camels, and nights around the campfire telling stories and enriching ourselves with the culture of the people.  When coming to the UAE, there is a chance to live this adventure at the Bassata Desert Village in the vast and pristine desert of Ras al Khaimah. This is a modern luxurious version of the adventure so you\u2019ll be pampered while experiencing the Bedouin lifestyle for the evening.   The experience begins with welcome of snacks and tea and then you are escorted to your tent. You\u2019ll be there with other adventurers and you\u2019ll sit on the floor on pillows and carpets. The tents are made from camel hair and are the same tents used by the Bedouin people for thousands of years. But this facility is not the form or fashion from those years gone by. It is new and modern and a project supported by the Ras Al Khaimah government. The bathrooms and common areas are what you would find in a luxury resort. Around the sides there are various vendors selling crafts, souvenirs, and local items. There is a central facilities area with a fully stocked bar and a serving area for the feast, suitable for a Sultan, that you are about to experience.   In the center of the vast open space is a floor with pillows and table where some of the guest choose to sit. Other\u2019s retreat to the tents on the knoll where there is an unobstructed view of the floor below.   As we settle in, our host checks in on us to see how we are doing and to tell us a bit more about the experience. All the staff are dressed in Bedouin attire and with a friendly smile he bid us marhaba or welcome and asked us where we were from. Most of the staff here are from the Middle East or Northern Africa and such places as Morocco and Egypt.   It is February when we are here and in the desert at night is chilly. Our Bedouin host ask if we have everything we need. He brings a blanket for us that adds a little romance to the evening as we sip wine and cuddle under the covers as the candles flicker on the tables around the tent.   The night we arrived there were families, couples and small groups in attendance. I hear German, Dutch, Russian, Hindu, and Arabic spoken. They venture out to various areas of the camp taking camel rides and there are ladies getting henna on their hands and feet. Some tourists dress up as Arabs to Facebook and instagram their pictures for soon to be jealous friends and family back home. Some people are at the bar enjoying a refreshing libation.   While all the festivities are going on, an army of white-coated cooks and chefs hurry about to prepare the feast. You know that you are in for something special as you see the preparations take place with serving trays and dishes being put in place.   Off to the side there is a massive grill and the flames from the charcoal sizzle the meats and spread the aroma about the camp. The call for dinner goes out and the readied guests make their way to the buffet. This is an Arabic Barbeque and the food is delicious and plentiful with too many choices to name. Beef, lamb, chicken and fish as well as various salads, vegetables side dishes, and desserts are on the menu each night. We take our trays back to our tent and have a thoroughly enjoyable meal chatting with other couples nearby in our tent.   After dinner, just as the inevitable drowsiness from over eating sets in, they raise the tiempo with the entertainment. In the central floor/stage area the spotlights come on and the talent enters the stage. Many of the guests leave the comfort of their tent to move closer at the tables around the stage area for a closer look or to take more jealousy inducing Facebook photos.   First up is the belly dancer. It\u2019s a bit chilly out but she doesn\u2019t not seem to mind as she winds and gyrates around the floor. Her body seems to move without a spine as she moves in every direction. The audience is mesmerized with her shaking and shimmering.   Next up is the Egyptian Tanoura dancer. I cannot understand how he is able to do what he does. Basically he twirls in one direction at a frantic pace for 30 minutes. As he twirls, his costume begins to \u201cfly\u2019 with each twist higher and higher. He begins to juggle various objects and layers of his costume become part of his props as he then lifts over his head. All of this while the music in the back grounds drums and trumpets in a frenzy matching his pace. By now he\u2019s sweating and is moving as intensely as the music. Any other mortal on the planet would have collapsed from dizziness after five minutes. For his finale, the spotlights on him go dark and with a flash, his costume lights up. It looks like a Christmas tree is caught in a tornado as the music intensifies and he twirls even faster. When the tiempo is a peak and he twirling is at a ridiculous pace with a sharp drumbeat he collapses and the music halts. Wow.   After a robust applause from the amazed onlookers, he picks out a guest from the audience. She joins him on stage and he puts his costume on her. She begins to twirl while laughing and talking to her friends in Russian. The costume begins to rise but she then falls and all join her with laugher.   After the entertainment is done, we go back to our tent to relax a bit while talking about the exciting evening that we just experienced. It was a wonderful time. Some of the guest will stay the night and wake to a deluxe breakfast. We decide to call it a night and return home.   There are many companies providing various types of dessert safaris. The Bassata Desert Village has taken the experience and made it a five star evening with their delicious Arabian barbeque, the deluxe facilities, the service, and the entertainment. If you seek to enjoy the Arabian nights adventure you always dreamed of as a child, Bassata Dessert Village in Ras Al Khaimah is the way to do it in style."

It is literally teaming with gazelle and Arabian Oryx.The environment varies from larger to smaller sand dunes to areas full of vegetation where you'll find many of the animals. Admitedly the areas with higher levels of flora are only possible due to the high level of man made irrigation provided but I guess that's fitting for an attraction near Dubai.The government has devoted 5% of the total land of Dubai to the DDCR and it is a special treat to visit it."

We booked a short morning tour but that was more than enough for us. After a short ride to the reserve we took off across the dunes. We saw some desert wildlife and stopped often for pictures. Refreshments were available for our tour, but others include camel rides, lunch, dinner, and other things. We paid less than 400 AED for our tour for two and had a great time overall. After a late night out the night before the 9 am pickup was not bad but some of the 4x4 action had some effect on our stomachs. The driver slowed down and took things easy as he saw we were having some trouble. Highly recommend as a great trip to escape the city of Dubai."

You can visit Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve while staying at the fabulous Al Maha Desert Resort & Spa, or by booking the tours offered by authorized agents. The activities organized by Al Maha's rangers are really amazing, allowing travelers to go deep into this oasis of fauna, flora and wildlife preservation. I booked only four activities: 1) Sunset camel ride - ending on the desert dunes, enjoying the sunset, sipping champagne and tasting the fantastic dates of Dubai. Shazzab and Darryn, the camel masters, will help you lose any hard feelings you might have against camels; 2) Early morning falconry - how can one miss this Arabian secular tradition? Brad, the falcon master, will bring falcons to your arm safely and you'll even caress them; 3) 4x4 Desert drive - extreme, intense and memorable, with beautiful dunes and the great desert scenery. Dwayne, a South African ranger, born and raised in the Kalahari Desert, will demonstrate all his skills driving on high dunes - please no eating before the ride and nerves of steel are a must; and 4) Wildlife drive - a quiet and amazing drive within the DDCR - Ranger Lihandra will give you a chance to photograph the rare Omani white oryx and many other desert animals. Enjoy!"

I didn't like the fact that we were expected to cover shoulders and knees out of respect for the local culture but the entertainment was a belly dancer in typical belly dancer outfit! She was very good but would have been better if there had been 3 or 4 dancers rather than just one. The drive back to our hotel was a nightmare with the driver going 150klm per hour - and I was in the front seat! Obviously he needed to get home in a hurry :-) Tip: wear sandals not sneakers as the sand is very fine and fills your shoes."

The dune bashing is starting immediately after the Arabic driver drove into the desert. It is excellent like the playing roller coaster in the desert. You will be able to watch sunset in the desert by climbing to the sand dune. Climb up is difficult to climb down. The sand is too soft.Camel riding and sand boarding are chargeable separately.The BBQ dinner was served but this is really a simple BBQ as only BBQ chicken is served. Other courses are mainly vegetarian.The most impressive and attractive were the Tanoura dance and Belly dance. It is amazing that the Tanoura dancers can spin more than 15 minutes without feeling dizzy.Overall, it is an unforgettable and irregretable trip to the desert.

The whole period from the time we were picked from our hotel by a comfortable 4X4 safari vehicle at around 4 pm till we were dropped back at 10:30 pm, I and my wife had a lovely time. Once we entered the desert park, It started with a falcon show which followed the real thing. Driving up n down the sand dunes,our vehicle skidding at times, tilting by huge degrees, blasting up sand in the air, it was all very exciting. Driving skills of our driver on the sand were commendable. There were total of 50 vehicles doing the same stuff and it all look exciting. This followed a lovely sun downer experience which meant we watched the sun set behind the sand dunes while it was getting cooler by every moment.Then we were taken to the base camp which was a lovely set up. Food, dance, drinks, camel ride, with dunes in the background made fo a spcial evening."

Yes, the Desert is one attraction that one should never & cannot miss at the cost of other attractions. The Conservation Reserve is a piece of area in the Desert where civilians are permitted to visit and roam freely without any restrictions. This is the same area where all the Desert Safari's are also done i.e. Sand bashing in the 4x4 land cruisers including the night camps.Since it is very difficult to see the desert on your own because of the terrain and permission issues one should book a safari wherein one can really experience the desert first hand. There is sand everywhere and the sunset is a delight to watch overlooking the desert. You can find people from neighboring emirates (Sharjah, Ajman etc) visiting the Dubai Desert over the weekends in their convoy of vehicles to enjoy the desert experience very frequently.Make sure to book with a good tour operator as this is one real experience which is equally thrilling and memorable and should be done with a good experienced driver only.."

Saw a couple of wild camels which was pretty good.But, it's just sand at the end of the day and Dubai is very ho so I wasn't gong to get too excited. We parked up, fried up some bacon n eggs, took some photos, had a look around, got a flat tyre, changed the tyre which made us sweat like we had never sweated before , drove up and down the dunes and then left sweating and dirty and with soaking wet shirts. It's alright. Maybe the trips are more entertaining but I wouldn't know. While in Dubai, it's worth seeing but it can be stupidly hot and it's not amazing."

The principles that underpin the reserve are founded on sound ecological practice - the mix of species and levels of habitat management intervention are carefully finessed and great progress is being made in establishing representative habitats of the region. Whilst the open water lake is probably an intervention too far, it does provide an additional ecological niche... An excellent outing and a break from the commercialisms of downtown Dubai."

Within a very short space of time, wildlife had almost totally disappeared. Sheiklh Zayed started the ball rolling with trying to save the Arabian Oryx in Al Ain and from then on the conservation of many species as well as large tracts of desert was enforced. Thankfully the hunting of wildlife is now banned and just last weekend I saw two sand gazelles. The first ones I had ever seen."

You can have a camel ride at the beginning before going over the dunes including a photo but you can also take your own photo - need to be quick though as they move you along quickly probably so you cant take your own photos and they can make money. The setting for the dinner was very authentic with big comfy pillows to sit on and low tables, there are also some higher tables. Food was authentic and lovely too. Camels here for rides also but not so good for photos as it is dark. Be warned it will be very hot, no airconditioning, it was 40 degrees at 6.30 pm when we were there in September.

Luckily this time I was in dubai for seven days and with family so we booked this trip. A few family friends that live in dubai also joined in and we booked the whole 4x4 SUV. There are many companies that offer this safari so someone's experience can be different from someone elses! My experience I would say was excellent! They first took us to some quad biking regions. Quad-biking was extra. We then got into our SUVs and all the SUVs from different hotels and locations got together at a meeting point. The fun started after that! They drove around the desert at really high speeds (dune driving)! It's like a roller-coaster ride except for it is real and there are no safety features. There have never been any injuries reported and the drivers are obviously experts. However I would not recommend this trip to people with hypertension or heart disease or anything that might cause them to feel sick due to this. For an average person, this is actually quite intense. We then stopped at a top of the desert to take pics of the perfect sunset. We get to a fort like location where we see and dine. There are many things there such as heena, camel rides, bbq and local and authentic foods, holding of eagles, shisha and and few other things. There is also Belly dancing and another dancer doing tricks. Food is included but alcohol is extra. There are tons of photographers there and unless you want to buy horrible (usually crooked) pictures at really high prices try not to let them take pictures of you. Some get really pissed off if you don't buy their pics. but in overall, it was an outstanding time out in the desert! I haven't met a single person that disliked this trip!"

One vehicle actually got stuck in a dune. We stopped to watch the sunset over the sand which was very beautiful and great photo op. We then headed to the \"oasis\" for a grilled meal, henna painting, belly dancing, hooka and camel rides.

At the campsite it was the same, there was no one to guide us where to sit. The dinner was good, I felt sorry for the familes with children who had to wait for food. There was no system, survival of the fittest. The belly dance and the other dances was very good, including the ride back to the bus in the dark"

It's a chance to experience some real culture and wear traditional costume."

The whole safari was great, great show at the end in the evening and the food was excellent given the mass production nature. We really enjoyed it. But please be aware that for an hour you are DUNE BUSTING, this basically involves a 4x4 (mainly Toyota Landcruiser) with 4 to 6 of you in it and a well trained driver attacking the dunes, we didnt roll, but we certainly slid sideways down a few, we didnt get air time as we smashed into them but we nearly did and yes the cruiser in front of us lost its bumper which apparently is common whilst another cruiser needed a shove to get it out of a sand trap. When asked the driver explained that these vehicles are generally dead after two years service, to be honest I am surprised they survive that long!"

The Reserve was formerly the location of camel farmers whose animals stripped the desert of the little vegetation it had. Rescuers and conservationists chose to protect a small portion of the natural desert and planted and continue to water some 6,500 plants/trees/shrubs (thus not real) in order to sustain the introduction of herds of gazelle and the precious oryx (al maha) - once a native animal, then extinct in the wild, and now restored to its former lands. The desert portion and the surrounding dunes are wonderful in their natural state. While dune bashing is a huge tourist attraction, from my purist's standpoint it is an unwelcome addition to desert activities."
