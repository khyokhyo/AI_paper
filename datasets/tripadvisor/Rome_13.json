This gem is a must see for anyone interested in the history of Rome. 2,000years of history carefully & lovingly brought to life with a light show highlighting the features and recreating this amazing villa right in the heart of Rome. This is the second visit for us to the domus Romane as we were blown away the first time. We will be visiting here on every trip as we enjoy the presentation so much Please note that it is recommended to buy tickets before visiting Rome as the tours are limited numbers (12 in each group I think) and book well in advance (Be sure to book tour in right language)The highlight for me is the mossiac which is remarkably well preserved an then filled with lighting display to show the beauty of the floor.The staff are friendly welcoming and helpful It is a superb example of a first class visitor attraction in Rome & well worth a visit"

If you are into history and any form of archeology, then this should be on your list.The museum entrance is right beside the Trajan Column and you head underneath the Palazzo Valentini where the desire to build an underground car park in 1998 discovered the ruins of two Roman mansions beneath the foundations.The museum was opened over the ruins in 2010. Walking underground on the glass floor through the actual ruins and with recreation through multimedia is a fantastic hour an a half experience.You do need to book as they have specific English speaking tour times and you cannot go without a tour.For 27 Euro for a couple, this is an absolute must see!"

In 1998 under a 16th century Renaissance building in Piazza Venezia in front of the Traian column they found the ruins of two magnificent roman villas of the 3rd century AD The museum was opened in 2010 and it is unique since they manage to recreate via visual effects how the villas looked like in their good old times and how their owners were living among spas and banquets. the effects are extraordinary, the narrative is excellent and the ruins themselves have some extraordinary artifacts.The guided tour of approximately 90m must be booked in advance and obviously you must choose the language you want the tour in. the entrance of the museum is on the rear of the building in front of the Traian column oversseing fori imperiali. be there a few minutes ahead of the scheduled start.unlike some of the comments I read, I found the staff very kind, polite and professional. a friend of mine was late, they kept his ticket at the front desk and escorted him downstairs upon his arrival.the tour may not be recommended if you suffer from vertigo or have impaired vision. you walk in the dark over glass floors laid over the ruins. beamers suddenly lit up the ruins and visual effects complement them to provide an idea of how they looked like. the glass floors may be uncomfortable for those suffering from vertigo. the visit is good for young children."

The sudden shifts in the floor and lighting can have the same kind of effect as strobe lights.Our guide was not happy at leading an English speaking group as was evident by his responses to questions. There was a diabetic man in our group who needed some water and the guide was very nasty about assisting him. They also stop in an area to buy souvenirs for about 10 minutes where you are almost forced to purchase something. This s about 20 minutes before the tour is ended. Normally this would be after a tour in a gift shop but the obviously want you to be a captive audience"

Who would guess that underneath a Renaissance palace are the ruins of one of the largest private homes of ancient Rome??The ruins were uncovered in 1998 and archaeologists have found more and more of the foundations of this ancient structure since then.What is unique are the visual effects they produce OVER the ruins to show what the rooms may have looked like and that made it come alive.....from the beautiful mosaic floors to all the grand columns, etc. Second best to being in Pompeii!"

In the end, the 90+ minutes really was worth it. Located right in front of the Trajan Column, the entrance was a little difficult to find but after that all went well. Guided, audio, in English for our group, tour took us underground to view 1st and 4th century roman excavations, findings, re-creations. Really amazing archaeological work. Nice connections made to modern times and yet helped you to build an appreciation for the Roman time period, and then the Renaissance thereafter. Very educational and enlightening."

Recommended by a friendly Italian tour guide - who showed us round the Colosseum and The Vatican - this fascinating insight into Rome's history and culture is quite tricky to find, thus missed by too many visitors. We went in a party of four adults and four children 8-16 and all were enthralled by the guide's narration, aided by stunning visual presentations which transported us beneath the surface of this wonderful city. The tour lasted around 90 minutes and was very inexpensive. A must-do, but booking essential as parties are limited."

We weren't able to go then, but on this return trip made it there. We tried to go on three separate occsissions before we were able to get in. I know you can make a reservation and pay in advance, but I refuse to pay the extra booking fee if I walk in the door and make a reservation. So, the staff were neutral- not overly helpful, and friendly, but not rude. I expected to be able to see some ancient mosaics, which I did, but it is sort of a \"story\". About how the ancient Romans lived as you go through different parts of an excavated home. The ruins are below you - there is a glass floor- but the multi media program makes it hard to really envision how the whole place came together because you are essentially in the car with only certain points being described spotlighted. It he multi media story was neat, but I would have liked to see the whole area lit up so that I could get a full picture of how it looked. It is also narrated by a recording, and the tour guide just ushers you from place to place to go along with the recording. The tour guide does describe some neat artifacts in the museum, but you are rushed through and can't take your time to look around at everything. The information at the end about Trajan's column was very. Interesting. I came back and did some more reading about Trajan after that. Overall, it was fine, and interesting, but I needed more time to just look around and understand myself how this all fit together. Not a must see in Rome, but if you have time it is interesting. Also, no photos are allowed so you need to use your memory!"

Where they are not, a light show using computer graphics is used to re-imagine them. This is all very well done and the visit is a good introduction to other Roman remains. One of our group was initially somewhat nervous about walking on the glass floor that covers much of the site, but soon got used to it. The tour ends at the base of Trajan's column and there is a short film about this. This was OK, but not really connected to the house itself, so it seemed like a bit of a time-filling add-on."

The tour provided an unusual, very interesting perspective on the ruins that lie beneath the streets of Rome. There is a see-through floor over the ruins and as the narrator talks, the areas that he is talking about are lit up. At the end of the presentation in each room, there is a light display that shows how the room might have looked during the Roman era. It was great to be able to walk over the ruins instead of viewing them from the side which is the normal viewing perspective. You visit various areas of the house and see baths, mosaics, living areas, staircases, etc. Near the end of the tour, there is a video about Trajan's column that tells the story that is carved on that monument. I wouldn't rate this a \"must-see\" attraction, but if you are spending a few days in Rome, it's well worth a visit. Our children (ages 10 and 12) enjoyed it too! Be sure to book it in advance."

I am confident that I booked the 2:00 slot since English tours were 1:30, 2:00 and 2:30. I had tried the 2:30 first and that was not available. I then went to 2:00 and was happy to see the \"Avanti\" button to proceed with the order.

So -- upon arrival early for our tour, we were informed that there was nothing Domus Romane could do for us. They took no responsibility and did not even acknowledge the possibility of a computer error. They insisted that this could not be possible and said nothing could be done.

Before I left on my Rome vacation I checked on the website for English tour times: there are only 3 a day (in the middle of the day, when all good Italians are having their long lunch)... and many of them were already booked. However, when I showed up, the people at the front desk told me that lots of tours were added at the last minute.. and in fact there was plenty of room in the 11 a.m. tour (not listed on their website).I highly recommend trying to get in. It's a 90 minute tour. The first hour walks you over the remains of several Roman houses... just beware, it's a little disconcerting to walk on a clear, glass floor. The last half hour covers Trajan's Column and when the tour is finished, you are looking straight out at the column. (In fact the tour office for this attraction is in the half-circle of buildings facing Trajan's Column.On the tour I attended there was a couple with a stroller. It's doable, but just know that you are going to have to carry the stroller up/down several flights of stairs if you do this.Good to know: this attraction is open on Monday, when many things in Rome are closed."

Not for the faint-hearted who don`t like standing on plate glass with nothing apparently below. But well lit and well guided with those who bring the rooms to life.

Overall it's a very cool site, but the audio guide (played on speakers not on a personal device) was a bit silly and dumbed down at times. In addition, the size of the groups makes it difficult for everyone to see a particular thing at one time.

It does a great job of using technology to make the ruins more understandable. You go down stairs to spaces excavated under Palazzo Valentini. Once you are at the ruins you walk on glass panels above the ruins while lights point out elements and a recording explains them. This is done in small tour groups, otherwise you wouldn't be able to see. You do have to move around at times to see the various items under your feet, but it gets easier as you get the hang of how it all works. They also use computer generated visualizations to show you what the building would have looked like at the time. This is really helpful to understand what you are seeing. Doing it while you are still in the room looking at the ruins makes it all much easier to understand.There are a few caveats. There are stairs going down to the site and back up again. Some of the stairs and a lot of the slots are glass. So you are walking on glass in a fairly dark space with the uneven ruins below lit up. It took a while for my head to get comfortable walking on a largely invisible surface above the ruins. But the floor in these areas is perfectly flat so it is very safe, no tripping hazards. Eventually I got used to it.One issue that should be fixed is timing. There are a few places where the recording doesn't allow enough time for the whole group to get to the next room, so the people in back miss part of the presentation. It's just a minute or two, but annoying if it's you in the back.It's also fairly expensive at $10 \u20ac each. But it was a large investment to create the framing and glass panels for the tour and the computer rendering and displays. They are then running small groups, so they can't be making much at doing it.All in all I think it points the way for new ways to present archeological sites.If you have seen the major sites in Rome and love archeology, make a reservation, and go see this."

Despite arriving 15 minutes late for our reservation due to our confusion about a Metro location, we were welcomed by the staff and personally escorted to the ruins below. At first we felt great disorientation in walking over glass floors in the dark, but we adjusted quickly. The holographic projections and computer modeling to explain the ruins of the Roman villa were exceptionally well done. As a bonus, the presentation on Trajan's Column at the end, isolating vignettes through spotlighting, was so much better than my art history class on the subject many years ago. Bravi to all the clever archaeologists who made this great experience possible."

I've done the tour 6+ times and have not gotten tired of it. Although it does wax cheesy at the end of the house tour, it makes up for that in the presentation of Trajan's Column. Truly a fascinating tour and a must see for history buffs!"

Having been to the Baths of Diocletian and Caracalla, and seen many other excavations in the basement of museums, I was a bit disappointed with how difficult it is to look at very small amounts of archeological remains and imagine these rocks as being some 10ft high, splendid structure. I honestly think it takes a trained eye to be able to look at these and see something more than what's there. But this is the issue that Palazzo Valentini deals with; they take the ruins and they 'draw' the missing bits on (with lights), so you can genuinely SEE what it would have looked like in its hay day. If this can't be done so easily, then they show you a video of what it would have been like, like a 'virtual tour'. And just when you think it's ending a little prematurely, they then give a detailed explanation of Trajan and his column (which sits right out front of the palazzo) which gives you a nice new understanding of an important monument that you'll probably pass several times during your stay in Rome. I really recommend this tour."

She didn't introduce herself, give any introduction to what we were about to see or explain how we would move through the space.-Our group of about 12 was too large for the small space in some areas of the exhibit, which made it difficult for everyone to see the highlighted areas.- Some of the explanations in the pre-recorded presentation & video could have been more concise."

I have mobility issues so this was something of a challenge and I would not have visited without checking for accommodations. If your tour is large you also often have to try to find a place to see the areas being spoken of, so if you walk slowly then you can find yourself unable to see past the others, and there are no places to sit and rest throughout. There is also a video at the end that was a bit dull, though full of interesting information. Unfortunately it was more than 20 minutes long, and most of the children in our group got very anxious at being made to sit quiet to watch a documentary.If you are an able-bodied adult, it is a really fun way to spend some time, but if you have any mobility issues or young children I wouldn't recommend it."

We were pleasantly surprised by this extensive archeological dig under a large civic building. The entrance took a while to find although it was right in front of us all the time. Small unobtrusive signs on a very large building marked the door. Once in, you must wait for the tour to begin at your designated time. Silent ushers steered us through a labyrinth of glassed floored chambers beneath the palazzo where we followed an impressive multimedia and lighting demonstration walking us through ancient roman mansions and baths and other surprises within spitting distance of the base of Trajan's Column. If you are classical studies geek or want to experience ruins from a novel perspective - this site is a must see in Rome. Don't miss it."

They were in the \"not more old ruined stuff\" frame of mind, but they actually really liked this, I think because they could make sense of the ruins and could get a picture of what Ancient Rome was like. Projected effects were really well done. It is a little long at 1 1/2 hours - there seemed to be endless rooms - but you can't say you don't get your money's worth. The illustration/narration of Trajan's column was great, but we had a giggle when after about 10 mins of listening to the story and Trajan conquering all, we found out there was still half the column to go! (Apparently he had to conquer them all over again.)Tricky to find, but well worth hunting out. With Il Vittoriano behind you, walk to the end of Piazza Venezia and turn down the street on the right (Via Cesare Battistini - stay on the RHS footpath). You soon come across a building called the Prefettura. There are two signs out the front advertising the Domus Romane. Go through the little door to the right. Make sure you book online in advance to get a spot and in the right language. You can pick up tickets there if you have your confirmation number, so no need to print.Worth the effort!"

We made our reservations through the hotel once we arrived in Rome. We didn\u2019t have any issue reserving a tour for later the same day.The most amazing part of the tour is when they project images on the ruins to recreate the house as it was hundreds of years ago. They obviously spent a good deal of time on the accuracy and scope of the projections \u2013 a few even took my breath away.The first part of the tour is amazing, although I did have some difficulty following the narration at times. The narrator would reference things \u201cas we saw before in the XX room/architectural feature\u201d, but I lost track of the rooms and architectural names because we were shuffled back and forth between rooms. We visited a couple of rooms multiple times which only added to my confusion. I\u2019d recommend paying close attention to the names so you don\u2019t have the same issue.The second part of the tour is about an entirely different topic. The first half was focused on the ruins we were actually visiting. The second half is about Trajan\u2019s column, which took me about 15 minutes to figure out. I would have liked a brief note of the topic change; without that introduction, I wasted time trying to figure out how the new narration connected to the ruins we had just toured.The second half of the tour seemed to drag a little bit. There is a 20 minute detailed video about the scenes on Trajan\u2019s column and what each represents. This was fairly interesting for about 10 minutes, but then I started to get antsy. I have the patience of a 9 year old, though, so you may not have this issue. My husband said it was fascinating.The last feature of the tour made up for the second half \u2013 they take you to a gate where you can view Trajan\u2019s column from a totally new, close-up angle. This was an unexpected delight.Overall, the tour is amazing and you should put it on your list of things to see in Rome."

It's a must see in Rome. The museum is somewhat hard to find at first, but keep walking into the squared courtyard and you should find the entrance on your left. We were lucky to get a tour time, but we recommend you book ahead of time since they only take maybe no more than 30 people in each time. Also, the entire tour was about 1.5 hour from what I remember."

As the narration led us from \"room\" to \"room\" (the remains of them being beneath the glass flooring) lights would shine on the various areas being narrated. It gave an interesting picture of life in an upper class early Roman house. The mosaic floors were truly beautiful. We also got to go down a narrow passage and observe the obelisk outside from a distinctly unique perspective. I probably liked this tour more than my husband who got pretty bored with it after an hour or so."

            "review": "Welcome 21st century approach to archaeological tours. We travelled to Rome as a family of 3 (8 year old daughter) and really enjoyed the Palazzo Valentini experience. It is a continuing excavation of 2 homes from Roman times. The tour itself is limited to 15 people per group so apart from one section that is very tight, one doesn't feel crowded or feel like one is missing out on seeing things. Booking is made online or by phone and unlike others, we found the process very simple and seamless. We arrived as instructed, 30 mins prior to the tour and collected our tickets that had been booked by phone the week prior. We were using the Roma Pass so when booking, we were only required to give our name to secure a booking. We were then given a reference number and then we collected the tickets.The tour is conducted mainly in the dark and narrated by a recorded story teller. We had a guide but her role was to direct us to where to walk next and to stop people wandering off. I asked her a couple of questions and she politely and knowledgeably answered.There are a few things to be aware of. As the tour is conducted mainly in the dark and as you walk on clear toughened perspex that you see the ruins through, many of the older members of our tour group struggled. There was quite a bit of nervousness and very slow and shaky walking and clinging to the railings which meant if you were stuck behind someone struggling, it was very frustrating as the narration started before you got there. This could be resolved if slower people walked at the back of the group but as is often the case, the nervous and shaky people always wanted to be near the front so everyone else got a bit frustrated.One other thing that was a bit annoying was that the sites beneath were revealed in bit parts to fit in with the narration. So the group would walk into a room in the dark and would stay in the dark while the narration took place and then 'taa-daaa' the great reveal would illuminate one section of the floor and then it would go dark again for some more narration in the dark until the next 'taa-daaa' moment when the next bit would be illuminated. This resulted to way too much standing in the pitch darkness waiting for the bit to be revealed. Too much emphasis on overdramatic 'the big reveal' moment to the detriment of the actual time we could see the site. It was like some overly dramatic designer thought it would be more exciting to have 'the big reveal' moments but over looked the fact that it left people standing in the dark for half the journey. Sometimes we just felt like it would be a lot less annoying to have the whole area illuminated at once so you could see how it fitted together more (rather that see an illuminated column base....darkness.....illuminated helmet.....darkness......illuminated bit of wall.....).Contrary to one other reviewer who did not like the supposition and 'possible' look of the place prior to it's destruction, we found this aspect is what held it apart from other tourist attractions. The recreations were of course created with some deal of creative supposition but not stupid, hollywood make believe. It was all recreated from the pieces found and knowledge gained from other sites from the same era. And the recreations brought a whole new dimension to our ability to imagine what the place really would have looked.All in all, well worth going to and a welcome addition to the other more traditional sites."

They bring the place to life, you go 25 ft underground (not a cave or tunnel don't worry!) and everything they found is 'as is' but they erected a glass ramp so you walk above the various rooms. I can't recommend this highly enough you really see and understand how the rich lived back then. The amazing things they discovered when the ruins of this Palazzo were uncovered are all there you move from room to room all on glass ramps with everything lit up in turn and various short explanations both in voice and voice and film.The Palazo was ruined by an earthquake and buried, built on top of and on top again and hence only excavated down recently - everything preserved what an experience!

I do wonder what I missed in those 2 minutes as the rooms which I missed were pitch black and could not see a thing. So make sure you go from the start and simply follow the light ;)"

We booked our tour in advance; so far as I could tell this had to be done by phone since we were using the Roman Pass. It was an expensive phone call from the US! It seems like most of their tours (and English are only a couple per day) sell out, though, so we had to do it for the 4 of us to see the museum. We arrived about 10 minutes before our tour time, and the front staff weren't incredibly helpful. They gave us our tickets but didn't really answer questions other than to tell us to wait outside (in a very hot courtyard). Oh, and the domus is not easy to find - we wandered around for a while until we found the entrance (past some guards that let us through once we said we had this tour scheduled) so make sure you leave plenty of time to get there.Once our tour started, the guide took us down stairs and into the rooms of the museum. (It was much cooler down there, a nice benefit!) The museum consists of several rooms of two ancient Roman villas, probably owned by a senator or other very wealthy individual. The great value of the tour is in the lights and projections that they use to outline what they're talking about and also recreate what the villa may have looked like. There are also some fine mosaics to view and information about archaeology and excavation. Overall we all really enjoyed it - even my teenagers were interested. The last portion of the tour is information, including a movie, about Trajan's column, which is nearby. This portion wasn't as interesting, in our opinion, although it was nice to learn a little about the history of the column and its depictions.This attraction is a great introduction to Rome and its history and archaeology. We were glad that it was one of the first places we visited in the city."

Although I did enjoy viewing the forum ruins in Rome, I sometimes felt that I was just looking at rock and struggled to imagine how it would of been during the Roman Time.This is where this museum really comes into it's own and offers a unique experience in Rome. It initially takes you onto the site of two luxurious roman villas underground and helps bring the villa's to life with the use of glass viewing screens below your feet, light projections and a good description.The final part offered a detailed explanation about Trojan's column, explaining the story behind the columns origin and the story carved upon it. We were then led to a viewing platform on level with the Column which offered a closer experience and view than you can usually see walking past. This left me in awe & the story behind the carving ensured I stopped and stared at the column every time I walked past. This was easily the highlight of the tour and potentially worth the admission fee alone, as it brought Trojan's column to life and gave a great insight. However I felt that the tour was overcrowded at times and this resulted in you being squeezed into rooms and not always being able to see the artefacts properly. When describing what we could see, a cgi video would often show how it would of looked like in roman times. Although this was initially interesting. I felt at times it was slightly over the top and went into too much detail as it was often describing things about the villa's that were guesswork. This seemed to be a view shared with the rest of the tour. I felt that the customer service provided by the staff could of been improved, when entering the museum and walking to the reception we were faced with employees who didn't seem overly happy to see us and along with the rest of the tour we were told to wait outside in the blistering heat. I saw no reason why we couldn't wait in the museum itself. Although being accompanied on the your by an employee, all of the detail was provided by a voice over through the speakers. admittedly easier for the museum, I felt this lacked a personal touch and prevented the real opportunities to make a connection with the your guide and feel comfortable to ask questions.Overall I feel that this is a must for any history fans visiting Rome as it offers a unique experience and insight into how the Romans lived and gives great detail behind trojan's column.

Generally English tours seemed to be in the afternoon and only 2 or 3 a day taking about 20. It is in the Palazzo Valentini which is the seat of the regional government just off the Piazza Venezia. The building is set back from the road and you need to go through the arch to the door on the left of the inner square. There's a small coffe shop and loos beside itSo what exactly is it? It's a tour of the layers of archaeology under the Palazzio. As well as showing bits of the remains from various dates it makes good use of lighting effects to reconstruct how the area might have looked. There are also short films giving more background including a particularly good one about Trajan's columnIt lasts about an hour and a half and was varied and interesting throughout. I was a bit wary that it might be light on content and a bit 'Disney-ish' but it wasn't and had a range of material which would interest people who know virtually nothing about Rome and others who had a more in depth knowledge"

This attraction was so highly rated on Tripadvisor that when I began planning my family's two week trip to Italy a year ago, the Domus was on my radar. After reading the reviews and the attraction's website, I knew that you had to make reservations for entry. NOWHERE on the website was it made clear that this is a guided tour offered in different languages at different times, so I assumed (incorrectly) that it was similar to the Borghese Gallery, where admission is limited to a specific number of people at a specific time, but your tour is self-guided. In preparation for our trip I made dozens of reservations at dozens of sites across Italy so that we could get in to things we wanted to see and/or avoid waiting in line, and several of those reservations were for tours in English (and it was made clear that the attraction had a tour and was not self-guided). I made our reservations for the Domus at a specified time, not realizing that the reservation was for a tour in Italian. By the time we realized the situation, we could not make any changes, the English tours were sold out, and the people at the front desk of the Domus were not particularly interested in helping us find a solution. We went ahead and went on the tour, hoping we could figure out enough of what was going on to make it interesting, but there is nothing intuitive about the information being shared, most of it is just a narration that we were unable to understand. After about an hour, we managed to slip away from the tour and exit. I am sure the tour is very neat if you can understand what they are saying, but be very careful when you make you reservation that you make it for a tour given in the language you want."

Talk about history coming alive--it was Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, Ancient Roman Style. You basically walk through an archeological excavation of a Roman mansion--instead of a guide telling you stories that try to help you imagine what was once there, each room has a projector and lights and narration to literally show you what was once there. I wish more sites in Rome had the funding to do something like this. My 10 and 7 year olds moaned and complained about everything we did in Rome but this blew their little minds. Even the adults in our group were ooohing and aaahing. Leave this for the end of your trip, because nothing can compare. Well worth the cost of admission."

Using light and video it really brought the Roman history to life and was a fabulous way to visualise the building as it must have been once. This museum is actually a tour and lasts 1.5 to 2 hours. The museum was hard to find (needs more signs on the street) and we did not know until we got there that you were supposed to pre book a visit (didn't say on the website). However, we were extremely lucky that an English tour was about to start and we had a really amazing visit. It also explains the Trajan Column in a lot of detail. If we hadn't been able to get straight on this tour by luck, our review would have been very different! We need more museum experiences like this."

The archaeological value here is incredible, as the ruins are excellently preserved and displayed in a historically valuable context. The staff are great also - my seven year-old dropped his hat while looking over one of the elevated walkways. Since it had fallen into an archaeologically sensitive area, one of the archaeologists on staff had to go to retrieve it, which they did without hesitation. Admittedly, it was funny to see a modern ballcap at the bottom of an excavated ancient Roman house. Reservations for this attraction are required, and its best to get there a bit early. Its easy to find, very close to Piazza Venezia. We got a pleasant surprise at the end with an incomparable close-up viewing of Trajan's Column."

You need to book the tour in advance for your appropriate language, although we just dropped in by chance and an English tour had only just started so we went straight in without booking (and boy is it dark joining this way). All the floors are strengthened glass so you walk directly over the ruins. The audio commentary tells informative and interesting stories about each room, and spotlights pick up each area, with computer enhanced lighting emphasising each subject matter. The real magic comes when the projections transform each rooms ruins into a visualization of the original rooms before your eyes, projected onto the walls. Its like watching a time lapse video of the room being built. Walking round the rooms last about an hour, then you go into a small theatre where they tell the story of Hadrians column. The actual carvings on the column itself are like the worlds first cartoon strip, however you can't follow their story viewing the real thing. This film tells that story by following the carvings and picking out particular people and events (in pseudo 3D). At the end you are taken to a ground level view directly below the real column. One of the most unexpected experiences whilst in Rome and wholeheartedly recommended as a must visit."

Then, when I thought it was over they launch into a separate and equally lengthy segment on Trajan's Column....at one point a video narrates the sequence of events illustrated on the column and when they get to a part where the narrator says...NOW WE ARE HALF OF THE WAY DONE I wanted to scream.

The light and sound effects really brought history back to life in a way that walking through the other historical sites does not, and later during our vacation (for example, in Pompeii) we found ourselves relating back to what we learned while at the Domus. It made it a lot easier to imagine what it may have looked like. The latest addition to the tour is a movie and a look at the column outside. It was nice to learn about the meaning of it, as well, as we had passed it several times already and were unaware of the historical significance.

I understand how the area needs to be protected, but it felt very contrived. The 4 of us struggled with how this has rated so high."

It's not cheap, and you have to take a guided tour. Ask when an English tour is offered. But it's worth it. They take you through an archaeological dig which has had a glass floor put over it, so you see the ruins below your feet! Lights come on to highlight the features that are being explained, and other lights \"draw\" in the missing parts. It is a very cool, new way to explaining ruins to people. At the end, you get a ground-level peek at the Column of Trajan. One of the coolest things I've done in Rome."

This is a tour of sorts through parts of two ancient Roman villas that have been found underneath a local building in the middle of modern Rome right near Trajan's Column. I say \"of sorts\" because the actual guide is an audiovisual experience triggered as you move through the space by a person who comes along with you (and seemed very hot and bored during our tour!). The actual villas are totally fascinating and the mosaics will really wow you. But the presentation is cheesy, you get rushed through what seemed like really interesting displays of coins, ceramics, and other things that have been found there, and the person accompanying you really isn't prepared to answer questions. The last half hour was devoted to a really interesting video about Trajan's Column that seemed totally irrelevant to the tour but definitely made me interested in Trajan and his campaign against the Dacians. A couple things to note. There is a lot of walking and stair climbing and not a lot of places to sit so definitely not something for people with limited mobility. The tour groups themselves are small and in different languages so it seems like a good idea to get a ticket in advance; I did it on-line through their website and came with a confirmation number. Finally, the place is a little hard to find as it's off the interior courtyard of a working building. If you're unsure, I'm adding a picture of the place you enter."

To understand Rome, his magnificent history, the lifestyle of your past citizens you have to visit this wonderful archaeological site placed just close imperial forums near piazza Venezia in the center of Rome.The guided tour last 1 hr and half, can be followed in Italian, English, Spanish, French and perhaps Portuguese.For information and to book your visit you can see at: www.palazzovalentini.it.I'm roman (Romanus sum, civis), I'm 52 and I started to visit Rome when I was child.During my life I visited a lot of roman archeoligical and artistic sites but none like this.This site was opened to visiting only five years ago.I visited today (June 7, 2015) the \"domus romanae\" (roman houses) and I say that it was the beautiful visit I made in a roman archaeological site.A young guide drove us in many ambients of the two houses: in each ambient there is a detailed description with spotlight and virtual reconstructions; from domestic thermal bath with \"calidarium\" (a sort of sauna), \"tepidarium\" (a poll with lukewarm water) and \"frigidarium\" (a cold water pool) to the big halls to receive hosts. Also aspect of medieval and renaissance life are treated because this two houses ware find under a big roman palace (Palazzo Valentini).A special moment is devoted to the Traian Column: a virtual reconstruction of low reliefs drove us in the history of battles leaded by the emperor Traian.After 1 hour and half we exit very satisfied of visiting this nice place.I strongly suggest all non-romans to visit this place first: Colosseum, Roman Forum, Saint Peter can wait two hours. It will be more suggestive to visit these places imaging all things you have seen in the Palazzo Valentini."

The guided tour only has a limited number of places which is great as it's not overly crowded. Some of the rooms aren't huge so only having a few people was a bonus. Absolutely worth a visit when in rome. The guided tour takes an hour and a half to complete so worth it to get out of the midday heat! Also worth mentioning is the restaurant on the other side of the museum (it's all related to the museum). We went for lunch before we visited the museum. Food was really good, not an enormous menu but the food served was delicious. We both had the pasta with tomato and mozzarella. We also had a bottle of water, a beer and a fruit juice.

We found out about it from looking at things to do in Rome on trip advisor, and booked our tickets online by following the link to Domus Romane website. It really did bring history to life, recreating parts of the house with stunning visual effects which you see directly below you, as you walk on a suspended glass floor above. This made the tour very easy to understand. Another favourite part was when they took you from the underground area to a door which when opened brought you face to face with the base of Trajans column, and as you look to the top the scale of it is even more impressive. I thought it was excellent value for money and would highly recommend this tour."

However, in my opinion, this trumps them all. Situated in the heart of Imperial Rome, just off Via del Corso, it may be unassuming from the exterior as a renaissance Palazzo. I urge you to book onto a tour of the museum in your required language and it is covered by the Roma Pass (however the full price tickets are 12 euros and is a bargain in my opinion). You go under the palazzo to walk on a glass walkway suspended above excavations of an ancient Roman Domus. The recreations in light shows and the information given is both incredibly informative, but also breath taking in the way they depict how the domus might have looked in all its glory. The next part of the tour focuses on the magnificent Trajan's column (located at the rear of the Palazzo) and the archaeological finds including the columns from the speculative location of Trajan's temple. A short video takes you through the carvings on Trajan's column depicting the Dacian conquest. Cannot recommend this place enough, a real hidden gem and an excellent excuse to get out of the scorching Roman sun."

Since we are not all experts, this visit was great, considering that the light effects make it easy for visitors to clearly spot remains of the Domus (i.e. palace) and special projections evokes the original look of the rooms, pools etc. Once a day there is a tour in English. You have to find it on the map, since in the Tourist Office they did not know where it is situated, although our friend speaks excellent Italian."

You see the actual ruins of a Domus through a plexiglass floor, and then you see holographic lighting that finishes the picture to what it would have been like. It's absolutely amazing!

The tour had two parts - the first 60 minutes was about the Domus and showed the excavated ruins along with light show driven reconstructions. The second 30 minutes was about the Trajan column and did a retelling of the story carved into it. All extremely interesting and well done. And great value as well. Easily accessible next to Piazza Venezia."

There is even a section of a Roman road with an explanation of how they were constructed as well as a film documentary explaining the story on Trajan's column. I highly recommend this museum, one of the best I have seen."

Often audio guides are hard to follow, maps are outdated, and many sites could easily be greatly enhanced by just placing more and better descriptive signs with some more drawings. Palazzo Valentini was the opposite and is an outstanding example how cool a guided tour can be made with modern tools. The tour leads you through multiple rooms of a ancient roman villa which was excavated below Palazzo Valentini. Most of the time you are walking on a glass floor above the excavation. An audio guide gives a description of the rooms which is accompanied by projectors that highlight what is currently explained, e.g. explains technical details, draws pictures of how it could have looked in the past or completes broken mosaics. This is really well done, improves understanding and drives imagination. In the end there is a video about the Trajan column which is beside Palazzo Valentini. The tour is also perfect for children, the children with us in the tour enjoyed it completely.The tour starts regularly, is limited to 15 people and tickets should be reserved / bought in advance. Some people say it is hard to find and we also missed it the first time because we just went for the house number, which was hard to find. You can find it easily on Google Maps first by searching for \u201cPalazzo Valentini\u201d. The entrance is located at \u201cVia IV Novembre\u201d (between \u201cVia dei Fornari\u201d and \u201cVia di Sant\u2019Eufemia\u201d, directly across the wax museum \u201cMuseo delle Cere\u201d).Coordinates: 41.896701, 12.483725"

It is difficult to convey to you what this was like but it held me in awe from the beginning to the end 90 minutes later. This exhibit was built right over an excavation of a wealthy prominent Roman's home. There are steel girders positioned over the excavation that support the glass flooring that you stand on. You get this feeling of being suspended in the air. A PBS quality narration mixed with music play over a theatre level sound system accented with computer driven projectors that highlight the excavations as the script plays out. What is so clever is that the projectors can throw out virtual 3-D like graphics over the ruins to help you visualized what the room could have looked like 5 centuries ago. Toward the end of the program there is a 15 min movie explaining the detailed historical carvings on a huge Roman column. It was a short history lesson that adults will find captivating but children will not so much. At the end there is an inspiring surprise viewing. This exhibit is really tricky to find. We looked for this and then stumbled upon it. It is way past a corridor in a government looking building. They certainly need better signs out front. It's on that 14 Novembre street right across from a wax museum. Regular fee is 12 Euros and it is given in different languages at different times of the day."

The floors of the modern building are plexiglass and walking on them is really disorienting, but ultimately a great deal of fun (kids would love it). The tour is escorted and has videos running to show how areas would have looked and a brief film in the middle of the tour gives you a chance to sit down and re-orient yourself (I think they planned it this way because the plexiglass 'experience' can becoming daunting if it were for a long period of time). As another reviewer said, it is a little hard to find, but if you use the street number and don't get intimidated by walking into what appears to be a government building straight through to the courtyard you will be well rewarded! You can make on-line reservations for tours in your language of choice, which I would recommend."

The archeology mix with technology demonstrates the wonders of ancient Roman life with a modern twist that allowed us to clearly see what life was like for this well off Roman family. One 2 minute technology presentation (a short part of the overall tour) did not work when we were there. The one major issue we had was booking through the internet. On the internet, I booked the date and time that fit our schedule after double and triple checking the correct date due to the use of the European date/month/year protocol. We received a confirmation email that I admit I did not check. When we arrived on the date I signed up for on the internet (March 30), the staff informed us the date we booked was actually (February 22) one full month before I ever traveled to Rome. While there was space three hours later (which we ended up taking even though it caused us to miss other activities) we had to pay a second time despite our protests to the contrary. If this only happened to me, then I would not write this type of review. However, when we showed up for the later tour, the staff was in the middle of an argument with other patrons who experience the exact same issue - they were told their booking was earlier than they traveled as well. I offer a word to help others avoid similar problems - double and triple check your booking - and any confirmation emails."

You stand on glass floors (pretty disorientating at first) whilst a (very thorough) voiceover guides you around the rooms of the house, and lighting cleverly highlights portions of the ruins to help you visualise the home as it was in Roman times. At its best, the lighting \"rebuilds\" the rooms, offering what static museum exhibitions can't - the chance to really imagine yourself in a Roman home. The second part of the tour describes Trajan's Column, ending with an up-close glimpse of the column itself.On the day we visited, it was pouring with rain, so this was a perfect indoor activity, but I'd urge anyone with an interest in the Romans to visit."

So they fill up really fast. We loved seeing the sound and light show that recreated the 4th century home over the ruins. The kids (aged 10, 7) found this really awesome. This was followed by a half an hour movie on the making of the Trajan Column, which the kids found boring. The lady sitting next to me and I both nodded off for a few minutes. The tour ended with viewing the Trajan Column right outside the backdoor of the palazzo, which is quite amazing. Those travelling with kids may want to know there is a very nice toyshop next door, Little Big Town."

An excellent presentation, with computer animation as well as with holographic one, makes the past times appear in front of you. Within the tour, there is a video presentation describing the bas relief of Trajan's column,too.The sight is open for public on 2010. Worth seeing!"

Reservations are required, as the tour is limited to about 16 people per tour and English tours are provided only during select times during the day. The organization responsible for this sight has done a stellar job in providing participants to quite literally view the past. It is a class act! In addition, we really enjoyed the \"bonus\" education given on Trajan's column (which is in the \"backyard\" of the Piazza Valentini.)"

As a family of four we loved our recent visit to Rome and thought the Colloseum, Forum, Vatican Museum, Sistine Chapel, Pantheon, St Peters etc.. were simply breathtaking. However, this attraction is head and shoulders the best value for money you will ever spend in Rome. It is a 90 minute long, visually interactive tour walking over the excavated ruins of an ancient Roman house. The ruins are seen underfoot through glass floors throughout the tour with computer generated images bringing the place back to life. The group we were in consisted of only 10 people so it provides perfect space and time to marvel at the ingenuity of the ancient Romans. This is not advertised particularly well and the tour (they alternate between English & Italian) has to be booked in advance. It cost 40 EURO for 2 adults and 2 children (under 17) but is worth every cent. So pleased we visited (thanks to Trip Advisor reviews) as it finished our wonderful 4 day trip to Rome off perfectly. ******"

I had never heard of this tourist attraction until I purchased the Roma Pass for my trip to Rome in October 2013. At the time, it was one of the places you could visit with the Roma Pass although sadly, on a quick search today, this seems to no longer be the case. This restored Roman villa located under a government building in the heart of Rome took my breath away. I am obsessed with Ancient Rome and visiting this attraction was like stepping back in time. The Forum, Palatine Hill and Colosseum, whilst fascinating, can sometimes start to look much like each other because there is not much left but stone. Not at this place. As you move through the remains of the villa, you walk on a glass floor suspended above the ruins of the villa. Lights are turned on at various times to highlight different parts of the villa and when the lights were turned on to show part of a collapsed staircase, I almost stopped breathing. The decorations and colour of the staircase were so vibrant, almost as if the owners had just stepped out and the staircase had just collapsed. There were excavated household items and even food. It was a magical and spine tingling experience. The photographs do not do justice to this place and nothing will prepare you for how amazing the experience will be. I cannot recommend it highly enough and you can bet that I will be back here next time I go to Rome. Tip for kids and any other member of the family too bored and not wanting to go - there is a large toy store practically right next door!"

We love history, art, etc. and this site was just fantastic. It is suitable for young or old, novice or experienced. Since many reviews already covered what it is, let me offer 3 practical items. 1. The location indicated in the map at the offitical website is either wrong or confusing. Here is how you get there. The entrance is east of piazza Venezia--about 50 yards--on the only big road where buses run (40, 64, etc.). You will see a small sign on the sidewalk and you enter the courtyard of a municipal building. You will find the ticket counter and the entrace to the left of the courtyard (as you enter). 2. English tours (90 minutes) are available every day at 1:30, 2:00, and 2:30. Booking online was very easy--13:50 euros each. The site is covered by the Roma Pass. You probably need to go to the site to use your Roma Pass for ticketing, however. 3. Walking on glass took us a while (about 10 minutes) to get use to. Just keep this in mind so you would shorten your adjustment time."

It really provided an amazing glimpse into the daily lives of the wealthy ancient Romans. The floors here are glass and built above the ruins, so that you are standing directly above the areas that are being described. Particular areas are highlighted with spotlights so that you know exactly which areas the commentary is focusing on at any given time. I highly recommend a visit. A few things worth noting: You must book tickets for this in advance, especially if you require an English-language tour. Also, you use this as one of the two free admissions covered by a Roma Pass, but you still must book in advance and you MUST mention the Roma Pass when booking. You do not need to have actually purchased the Roma Pass at the time that you make your reservation. Also, this place is pretty difficult to find. Via IV Novembre is located just off Piazza Venezia near the Vittorio Emmanuel II Monument and Trajan's Column. If you are struggling to find it, it is right next to the Hop On, Hop Off bus stop, near a large toy store."

I was knocked over by the whole experience. Really gave you a feel for what was there, and how archeologists found it and worked out what it was. Well worth the time and price. Caveat - the experience is 1 1/2 hours and you stand for all but about 10 minutes. It can be hard after a long day of sight-seeing. There were some elderly women in our group who had a hard time standing that long. I recommend this for ages 13 and up."

Walking on a glass floor over the excavations was a little disconcerting at first, but when we got used to it, this was an amazing experience. The art historians and archaeologists who worked together to bring this building back to life have done a superb job. You start off looking at just the stones, which is fascinating on its own. But then during the commentary a part of the room lights up, a floor, a ceiling, a staircase, a mosaic, a thermal bath. Onto it is projected light, colour and pattern to show what it would have looked like in its full glory. There's also sound so that that you can imagine yourself right back there with the Patrician family whose home this was.For anyone with an interest in Roman history this is a truly fascinating visit and one I can't recommend highly enough."

Our B&B owner booked this for us however I think different language tours run at different times (eg.

I think the main value is that you're given the opportunity to visualize what the ruins would have looked like, and their original structure is outlined in lights or lasers. Subsequent visits to Ostia Antica and the Forum helped with the big picture. The fact that this is underground below the municipal building is just amazing."

Tours are offered in Italian, English and French and occur at different times of the day. We reserved our tickets online for an English tour a fair few weeks before we left Australia for Rome. The website says to pick the tickets up from the booking office which in this case is the actual building where the tour takes place. The building is not too difficult to find however you may think you are in the wrong place. The entrance is actually in a courtyard of a government building where government officials often are guarding the entrance to. Just tell them you are there for the domus tour and they'll let you through.A very interesting and different attraction in Rome. A highlight of our trip to Rome.

This proved a good move, the pre-recorded commentary was extensive and would have been difficult unless you were fluent or nearly fluent in Italian. There are no labels to read etc. In contrast to some other reviews, we found the staff helpful.The site itself was very interesting and I thought imaginatively presented. The numbers were limited- there were 9 people on ours and we all got a good look at the exhibits, the guide being careful to ensure this happened.Thought it a bit odd that the souvenir shop was half way round, but we were waiting for the group ahead to finish their tour.The film at the end describing in detail what the images on Trajan's column depict was fascinating. It wasn't overly long, nor boring as some reviews have suggested. I recommend this if you have any interest in ancient Rome.

You go through different sections of an excavated home of a supposedly wealthy person.

Some areas of the home are quite small and only a few people can enjoy it if the group is not asked to move along and give others a chance to view them. Unfortunately, this is what happened in the group I was in. Our group totalled 16 persons, 10 of whom were teenage foreign students who selfishly monopolised most of the attractions, leaving the rest of us unable to view them. The guide that was with us, could have done more to move the group along so that each person has a fair chance to look at the exhibits, but she was rather indifferent and did nothing. What they could do is to limit the number of persons in each tour group to 10 persons so that everyone can have a fair chance to look at the exhibits, and for sections where only 2 or 3 persons can view the exhibits at a time, for the guide to get people to move along. Also, a stop at the gift shop comes halfway through the tour. It should have been at the end of the tour so that those of us who are not interested in buying anything can leave, instead of standing around for 15 minutes waiting for those to finish buying their souvenirs, before the tour continues."

This technology \u201cfills in the blanks\u201d by giving you the Before-and-After views. It\u2019s very cool. The whole tour is so well done. This relatively new exhibit takes you on a walk \u2013 yes, actually walking on Plexiglas floors to see these houses which are UNDER a 16th century palazzo. The Plexiglas takes a little getting used to, but the kids love it! Obviously, these houses were owned by powerful Roman families. You will see various rooms including the kitchen and a very impressive private \u201cRoman\u201d bath with a balcony. You\u2019ll see beautifully decorated walls and structural walls made of huge travertine blocks. The mosaics are so stunning and intricate, as are the tile floors. It\u2019s amazing to realize that you are actually viewing ancient Roman houses from when Hadrian ruled! Check out the website: palazzovalentini.it The photos are fabulous but nothing compared to the seeing it in person! As they say on the website, \u201cAn unforgettable journey through time\u2026..\u201d and you\u2019ll want to experience every minute of it!This tour is worth every \u201cpenny\u201d of the 12 Euros entrance fee! But you must Book in Advance \u2013 and pay online or by phone \u2013 you CANNOT buy the tickets at the venue. They allow a maximum of only 15 people for the English-speaking tours \u2013 and there are only a few English-speaking tours every day. If you have a Roma Pass \u2013 call them to use it. (We had difficulty using the website \u2013 maybe it was our credit card \u2013 but our hotel concierge made the call for us.) Reminder \u2013 plan ahead as they are closed on Tuesday \u2013 and this is a very popular tour even though it\u2019s not even in Rick Steves\u2019 tour book yet! (How did that happen?)It\u2019s located just around the corner from the \u201cWedding Cake\u201d (Victor Emmanuel Monument) and Trajan\u2019s Forum.This is an incredible look at ancient Rome that you won\u2019t want to miss! I will see it every time I return to Rome!"

English is at 4 & 4:30.Tried to book and was pushed to the only place which is the website, pressed the \"English\" button which is fine until you book and it converts back to Italian on the booking pages. Hence we booked an Italian session by accident not realizing the languages were different, as you can imagine the Romans on the front desk were very sympathetic when we showed up and they told us about the language ..... They almost laughed. Asked politely if we could change, no chance, non possibli. We went through it, looked ok, but just boring not understanding anything."

This was a skilfully managed exhibition imaginatively portraying the physical and intellectual process of an archaeological dig exposing the layers of the palimpsest that is Rome.  I was in a group of about a dozen people for my tour (at 3.00pm on a Saturday). Accordingly there was ample space to see the exhibits. I particularly enjoyed the audiovisual information provided about Trajan's Column which was followed by the short opportunity to see the Column from ground level.  I consider my experience would have been improved in 3 ways but I don't consider that the attraction is responsible for the first 2 lapses. As for the third, I humbly recognise my failure to fully understand the italian language. Firstly, I felt unable to book a tour myself since it appeared to me that I had to telephone to do so. Happily my hotel did it for me. I found myself on an english tour at a time when my earlier perusal of the web page suggested to me that no such tour was being offered. Secondly, it was unfortunate that despite this site being so popular among tripadvisor users, it did not appear on the various free Tourist Maps I picked up in Rome. My Hotel were slightly hampered in being able to mark precisely where I could find it. I therefore took longer finding its precise location than anticipated and accordingly was rather disappointed to have missed the very beginning of my tour. Thirdly, there were some items that had been recovered in the dig and were on display. I would have been very grateful had the information posted describing such been available in English"

Especially suitable for any members of your party who have trouble visualising what ruins might once have looked like, or people new to archaeological excavation exhibits.Tip: Put your camera away, no photos or video allowed, but just accept that this is part of the magic that they're trying to weave you into - cameras would ruin that. You wouldn't have time anyway, it's a relatively fast-paced 90 minutes, with no dawdling. You are moved through as a group with a guide."

The home sits on top of history so to speak and the tour takes you down under street level to see the layers of Roman life as it was. The tour takes you over thick glass floors from which you can look down and see the original tiles, Roman baths, walls. Spot lights light up various focal points while a canned narration takes place in flawless English through speakers. The tour guide merely escorts you from one room to the next. Because you are walking on glass over things perhaps 10 feet under it, in the semi-dark it is a weird feeling and if you fear heights this tour probably isn't for you. It took some getting used to for me.To begin the tour you will have to wait in the courtyard until the appointed time which we were told was two minutes before the start. There is nowhere to sit. There is a little cafe next door so buy some ice cream and sit on their chairs. There is also a restroom beyond that."

Our subsequent days were full and it was only on our last day, in mid-afternoon, that I inquired again. We had only one option: 6:30 p.m. that night; she was mightily reluctant but I had looked up Tripadvisor and reassured her. Five minutes into the tour, she was won over and at tour's end pronounced it one of the best sites in Rome and the best introduction to the ancient city. What made it so compelling? It is the extent of the archeology, the stunning and remarkable finds, the scintillating presentation, the excellent audio, and the impressive use of lighting and modern imaging techniques to transform the various rooms into a picture of life 2,000 years ago. We have travelled a fair bit and cannot think of another site anywhere that combines archeology and technology in such a dramatic, cogent, and educational form. We both wished that we had seen it on our first day! It should not be missed. My only cavil - the ticket staff and guide accompanying the audio-visual tour seemed bored to the point of indifference. And, incidentally, they take about a maximum of 20 on the tours so it is comfortable without any crowding or rushing."

The Palazzo Valentini is now the HQ ot the province of Rome, and you need to go through the entrance into the courtyard to find the domus ticket desk through a door on the left. There are toilets and a cafe in the courtyard.The tour takes just over an hour and there are other reviews which go into some detail about the content. I would just emphasise how well it brings to life the way an affluent Roman family lived in ancient Rome. From one of the windows in the basement there is wonderful view of Trajan's column, and at the end of the tour a short film describing the carvings and the story of his campaigns. It adds an historical context to the domestic life of the family of the house, as well as providing a welcome sit down.A lot of the tour is in semi darkness and on glass floors so be prepared to tread gingerly at first until you get used to the sensation. It is a welcome change to the crowds at a lot of tourist sites in Rome and it was the attraction we most liked on our visit. With the other pre-booked tour of the coliseum which included the underground section and the top tier, it gave a real impression of life in Rome and the amazing achievements of the Romans. Don't miss it."

From reading their own website and Tripadvisor reports, we weren't entirely sure what to expect. There is a medieval house built on the ruins of a grand Roman house which has been excavated (leaving the house above intact). There is a quite a bit of archaeology to see, including parts of the baths, but the clever bit is the way they use special visual effects to recreate how the underground ruins might have looked in their heyday. The tour is pre-recorded and explains the site very well. At the end there is a very good movie which explains Trajan's Column very well. All in all the tour takes 90 minutes. One comment - we wondered why the staff were so different from normal tour guides - the reason - they are employed by the state - so not career guides - and for what-ever reason are off-hand (border-line rude) with visitors and definitely grumpy. At \u20ac13.50 each we (4 of us) reckoned it was good value for money."

            "review": "Ancient History meets 3D Special Effects Technology - Extraordinary. Whilst Rome is steeped in history Domus Romane is unique in the way that it makes the Ancient History of Rome so accessible to those that aren't so scholarly inclined (not to mean that it isn't also fascinating for those that are very scholarly inclined). The site is the archaeological remains of an ancient Roman Villa situated beneath the (relatively) more modern Palazzo Valentini. Discovered by archaeologists in 2007, it only opened to the public about three years ago after significant work by a team of art historians, archaeologists and architects. Sophisticated computer aided design tools and light shows (and voiceover commentary) bring to light how the Villa looked 2000 years ago. Because a Renaissance Palazzo was built over the top of the Roman Villa in the 16th Century, the ancient Roman Villa is well preserved. You can still see mosaics, inlaid marble floors and other treasures. You gradually progress through a series of rooms over the course of one hour. You walk over clear plate glass and the villa is beneath you. It is hard to describe how much the effects bring the history to life here. At first I was thinking that it was a little too \"Disney\" for such a historical discovery but throughout the course of the walk through the project I became convinced at how wonderful it was to see such a coordinated effort to bring the history of Rome to life so effectively. Because you are situated right beside Trajan's column, there is a fascinating movie at the end of the viewing outlining the story of the column, including an explanation of all the art work on the column and the history behind it. Some might find it a bit long, particularly if you arrive here after walking all day (and you are on your feet for an hour here during the sound and light show). You do get to sit down for the feature about Trajan's column though. Entry is 12 Euro for adults. There are only limited tours in English and because they only allow groups of limited numbers in at a time, you must book tickets in advance to get in at a pre-booked time session. We had about 15 in our group. You can book tickets directly on their website (www.palazzovalentini.it) but it is in Italian. I found it easier to book through Select Italy, an online company in Chicago we have used many times for all our Italian museum and theatre bookings. They only release the tickets about one month in advance though. Closed on Tuesdays. There were a number of kids in our group and they seemed to really appreciate the experience (they were between 10 -13). If you are thinking of bringing very young children please be aware that the rooms are very dark during some of the lighting shows and it takes at least one hour on your feet. When trying to locate the entrance, don't look for a sign to Domus Romane because you won't find it. Whilst you are viewing the Ancient Domus Romane, the site entrance you need to look for on the street is the 16th Century Palazzo Valentini which is not far from Piazza Venenzia and also right near Trajan's Column. I found this to be a highlight on this trip to Rome."

It's amazing to think that back then they had running water, heated baths and floors, etc. Of course, this was someone of incredible means, but still...We also got a glimpse of an enormous ancient column and some history behind Trajan's column.

The methods used to let you observe and to inform you are very effective: a narrator voice, glass floors, lighting, laser projections, sounds: all perfectly organized and synchronized to get a very good understanding of how (wealthy) families lived in the Ancient Rome and how their houses (incl. baths, sauna, ...) were constructed.The second half of the tour consists of a detailed explanation of Trajan's Column where you can sit down and watch a large screen. Very interesting and at times amusing stories.Highly recommended."

You walk on glass floors and the lighting, computer aided visuals and lasers bring to life what was once there. There is even sound to give you a real feel of what it was like to be in this grand house, with swimming pool, sauna, library, great rooms, etc. Most educational and in a clever way. Hard to believe you are in the very centre of Rome itself with the traffic and tourists outside when you are down here doing this archaeological experience. Well worth it, especially if you are a history buff."

            "review": "Very well done, informative, but probably too much for younger children. Le Domus Romane di Palazzo Valentini is a gem of an attraction, definitely worth the entry fee. Like the city itself, the site has multiple layers of historical significance (ancient, medieval, and contemporary), each of which is to some extent explored in the presentation and guide. It wasn't discovered until 2006 when digging began for a parking lot, so the site is still very much a work in progress in terms of excavation, and the ticket price is no doubt subsidizing some of that. The multimedia overlay (aural and visual) vivify the the ruins, and, as others point out here, help the untrained person appreciate what to look for when exploring other ruins. I did not find the effects Disney-esque and instead found them informative (that is--effects weren't primarily for show; they're trying to help visitors access a related experience). In my haste to prepare our itinerary, I somehow missed the fact that the tour includes extensive information about the Trajan Column, and, indeed, after you finish with the palace, you move to an area for another full presentation on this other marvel, and then you get to look at the column from its base giving you a perspective no other tourist is able to have. I visited with my very smart but impatient 10 year old son. He really enjoyed the palace tour and was attentive throughout (though the British-hybrid accent was sometimes difficult for him to understand--it is pre-recorded), and that part was just the right length for him. The Trajan Column presentation happened in what was \"overtime\" for his attention span, and frankly, I similarly found it hard to take in much more information at that point. That's unfortunate, because the concept of the Trajan Column presentation, which is not as sophisticated or creative as the palace presentation, is a good one--it tries to teach visitors how to read the story of the column and to imagine the motivations for creating it and what its significance might have been for its earliest visitors. It takes a little advance planning to work this into a busy schedule, but it is worth it. There are very few available seats for each tour and only a few English tours each day. Reserve in advance, and enjoy."

Let me start the review by saying the museum itself is fantastic, however the supposedly English speaking guide was the worst guide ever. We went on our last day in Rome (made reservations for 6 online- carefully noting the English speaking tour). A TripAdvisor Reviewer had warned the people at the museum were not friendly or helpful so we expected this. We arrived a few minutes early- there were 12 of us on tour and all were completely excited about visiting this museum. What we weren't prepared for was our English speaking guide could only moan \"this way...\" and clearly could not speak English. She would not allow for ANYONE to look at the items on display that had been mentioned in the prerecorded tour. She rushed past display after display... full of fascinating artifacts! All 12 of us wanted to stop and inspect- but were rudely scolded in Italian if we didn't proceed at her very hurried pace. This happened more than once! Everyone on the tour was thinking surely we will get to go back and see the displays after the tour. When she marched us past the giftshop, we were certain we would get to come back by. What tourist site doesn't want you to spend money in the shop?? Not this one or maybe not this guide. The poor excuse for a guide could have completely ruined the tour- however, what has been excavated here is well beyond her rudeness or lack of interest in her job. The museum truly is remarkable. It's worth going, but be warned about the guides. Because of this, I have to rank as poor."

This is particularly true about many sites in Rome and Italy (e.g. sadly, even the forum.)Palazzo Valentine is an AMAZING exception. It is a perfect example of how EVERY archaeological site should be present to the public (if the resources were available.) Through the use of lighting, video, reconstructions, etc. they walk the visitors through ever aspect of the remains of a few amazing houses and their context to the adjacent Forum of Trajan. It enables visitors to clear see how an archaeologist interprets a site and reconstructs what the ancient buildings must have looked like. Whether a curious novice, or a professional archaeologist, this tour was an ABSOLUTE TREAT. To quote my friend who visited with us: \"They don't charge enough.\" I would encourage visitors to go here FIRST, and then to the forum, and elsewhere.If only some of the more significant archaeological sites in Rome had half this much effort in interpretation! p.s.

Multimedia experience, calm pace, small groups, incredible journey back in time. Bravo!!"

The dig has uncovered a Roman bath and an adjacent villa. It takes about 1.5 hours and is moderately priced.Much of the tour is in very dim light. Good sense of balance recommended. Not a good venue for children."

Although you visit it as a guided group, it is a much more personal experience than most historical sites. Group size is limited and is language specific, so you need to book online well in advance to get the date you want. The audio and lighting are well-coordinated- it reminded me of a very good Disney attraction. Tour lasts about 90 minutes, and much of it is fairly dark. Probably not great for younger children, but it could be fascinating for older ones"

In this museum, you stay as a group and move through Roman ruins with a recorded audio track and a computer/light show that really brings the ruins to life. The tour shows you what the rooms would have looked like in their day by projecting images. For me, the highlight was the video that showed sections of Trajan's column and explained the story that the spiral column told. It kept my almost-ten year old son's interest throughout. You move from room to room. Our guide acted like he did not want to be there, but his job is just moving us from room to room for the presentation.You are walking on a clear floor for much of the tour -- that was hard to do at first. It helps if you don't look down when you are walking.This was a great museum to see. Very unique presentation. It runs about 2 hours."

It was one of the best things that we did. It is really hard to explain, but you walk underground and see ruins from Rome that have been excavated. Okay, that really does not explain how this exhibits works. You walk on glass the whole time and underneath you, you can see the ruins. Now that might sounds boring, but it is NOT. The whole thing is narrated (make sure to get reservation in advance an in English-only about 15 people at a time and there is only certain times in English) and very interesting in that lights will appear on the parts that the narrator is talking about. Amazing and air conditioned, which was a plus. I highly recommend coming here."

The Domus Romane was discovered beneath a government building, along with centuries of history set out in front of you to explore. From a technical standpoint, this museum sets a new standard in achievement, as you are actually shown projected images of what things used to be like in the ancient times blended with the real setting where they were. As if the Roman house were not enough, the visitor can see relics from the middle ages as well and compare life as the different layers of history are peeled back in front of your eyes. Perhaps the most important discovery is shown at the last of the tour - a section of a column recently uncovered that may well be the largest ever found and thought to be a possible relic of the lost Trajan Temple.If you are visiting Rome for the first time or even the 10th time, you must see this amazing exhibit!"

It was extremely enjoyable and gives you a rare insight on how life in Rome was so long long long ago! If I knew what I know now, I would skip the Vatican tour and go there, but that's just me. We booked it in advance. They have different language tours at different times, so check the website for that info. The groups, I beleive, are limited to 10 or 12 people( may be less) because of the space issue.The museum is located inside the courtyard of some oficial building with the guard standing outside at the gates. There is a sign for the museum, but you can easily miss it, if you are looking for a \"museum\". So climb those few steps and go inside courtyard and it will be on your left. The tour is about 2-2.5 hrs, packed with information, which I found absolutely fascinating."

This tour is very informative and does a fantastic job laying out the history of some of the ruins in the city, and it does this in a very engaging and entertaining way. The tour itself is of an excavation site of a Roman Domus (or house) and uses visuals (lights, lasers) to bring the excavations back to life. You are standing for the first part of the tour, so comfortable shoes are recommended. Also, I highly recommend booking this tour online as it does get sold out very quickly, as there is limited spots for each tour."

The floors are glass, so you can see the ruins of the Roman house on all sides of you. The guides do little except move you into the right area of the room (the tours, which are available in different languages at different times, are fully automated--there is a recorded track and spotlighting of/projection onto specific areas is timed out.) Seeing the mosaic floors in situ, as well as the Roman road; wondering what is beneath the immoveable walls of the current structure--it made for a romantic experience. As a former student of archaeology, I freaked right out when presented with the remains of a massive column from what had to be Trajan's temple. I had no idea why this Trajan's column stuff was coming in, all of a sudden, but there was a nice little surprise at the end that explained it. The odd bit is that you go through the gift shop in the middle of the tour, between the Domus and the Trajan part, and it seems like they let you move on when somebody cracks and buys something. It's a totally passive experience, which was wonderful after a full day of actively touring about and looking at maps, but that's the best way to schedule it. It's great for kids, as well--I highly recommend it. The story arc is pretty compelling."

This is essential because only a limited number of people are allowed on each tour.I found the place very easily, it's opposite the wax museum, in the municipal building. Look for the flags, and there is a huge poster outside! Enter the building and the entrance is on the left. Tip: If you are early, don't sit on the round tub in the entrance. It may look like a seat but you will get told off for sitting there, because it's an artifact from bygone days.Inside you walk above the villa on glass, often in low light levels. This is somewhat disconcerting but you get used to it.. As you tour the villa, the audio visual presentation is wonderful. This is surely the most complete Roman villa that I have seen.. Your tour ends with a short video about Trajans Column., and you get to see it close up, albeit through a grating. The whole tour takes abut 90 minutes, with a break of a few minutes. If you are interested in Roman history, this is a must. It may not have much appeal for children though."

She insisted I go and called to make a reservation for me which is the first thing I suggest you do, as they can only let so many people in at a time and of course there are only 8 hours its open.What an incredible surprise this was, I cant thank Natalia enough for telling me about this.Your tour takes you below street level (where much of ancient Rome is) to an excavated area that has revealed a grand house, baths, and courtyard from the time of Emperors Hadrian and Trajan. the tour takes you through a series of rooms with clear floors through which to see the ruins, a recording explains the room you are in, what was found and what the room may have looked like, then slowly to pleasant music, video laser type technology build the room around and below you to what it would have looked like in its day, truly amazing. The tour takes about and hour and a half or so and gives excellent info and stories. I'll not say too much more so that you have the pleasure of the experience yourself. I am a history fanatic and the older the better for me so this was wonderful. If you are in Rome for a few days and enjoy this also go to Basilica of St Clement as there are underground ruins you can tour there also, its only 5 euro and you get to descend into the 1st century of the original buildings, more rooms are still being discovered and much of ancient Rome remains buried for future generations to discover, your imagination will run wild, enjoy!"

            "review": "Okay experience. This attraction has amazing TripAdvisor reviews so I booked the tickets months in advance and paid more for the shipping than for the tickets themselves! From this I was really expecting something breathtaking.The attraction is easy to find- just find the Trajan column and walk alongside the building directly in front- you will see a wax museum on the other side of the road in front of you- the entrance is opposite to this. There is a large sign for the attraction outside the doors. Through the doors is a small square with the attraction entrance on the left, the next left contains public toilets.This tour was okay- you enter and stand on glass flooring with ancient ruins below. There is not much to see- but a recorded voice explains the ruins with the help of lights. This tour includes a fair bit of walking in the dark as the guide does not turn the narration (and therefore lights) on until everyone is in place. The narration is mostly speculation as there are many uncertainties presented by these ruins.Halfway through the tour you are taken into a giftshop which was a bit awkward as no one appeared very interested in purchasing anything. There was a substantial kid's section, and a fair amount of books to purchase.Nothing is added to this tour by being led along by a guide- this site would be as effective if people were just allowed to walk around by themselves. It is for this reason that I am hesitant to recommend this attraction to anyone who is not deeply interested in Ancient Roman house ruins- but has little specialised knowledge. The narrator's comments were largely simple observations- whereas I longed for a real insight into the context, desires and mysteries behind the construction of the building. This tour lasted around 1.5 hours- the first and last 10 minutes were best.#There is no water or refreshments available at this attaction. One of the tour group members had to leave the attraction and miss out on some of the tour to get water."

The next time I came to Rome, I found it, but I was told in an annoyed voice that there was only one tour in Italian and one in English offered. They seem to offer very few tours only. What I didn't know in the first place was that you can't visit the place without that guided tour. Information is so poor, you really feel left alone.

The tour uses lights and image projection to walk you through the house, the attention to detail is fantastic and its very good for children. The only downside is the staff. Unfortunately, the staff on the reception are rude and the guy who was showing us round was very rude, and was on his phone constantly. when going into another part of the house he would shout 'move' 'come on' 'over here' you could just tell he just didn't want to be there.

The ruins are beautiful but just normal, but the recreation they do about the place by using the lights and sounds is awesome, and its very explanatory. At the beginning I thought the ticket was quite expensive, but when the visit ended I didn't think it any more! You have to reserve it by internet, and the webpage works perfectly. It was a little bit difficult to find the museum for us, because the indications are not very good, but just look for the Trajan Column and a kind of door that is placed around it, and that's a \"window\" of the Palazzo Valentini :) You have to enter through a courtyard, and with arriving there about 10-15 min before the visit it is enough."

You'll see the level of the road and housing in those days and see how the foundation of a Renaissance palace slices through a 100 meter roman mosaic.Great blend of technology and history, it highlights what it explains, go see it prior to visiting other sights, you'll see them with different eyes.I'm Romanian so as a bonus we got ourselves the explanation of Trajan's column as well and a multimedia representation of the layout and how Trajan's forum looked like in the glory days and in the same excavation sight they discovered columns twice as thick as those in the present day Pantheon. Imagine that prior to beeing Trajan's forum it was a hill as high as the present day column! Nota bene, What it doesn't say is that Trajan was the first provincial emperor, he was Spanish, Provincia Iberia and he had to be twice as competent as a Roman native to become emperor so his forum and first shopping Mall were dazzling it trumped in size the adiacent Caesar and Nerva Forums, and it was covered in Gold from the new acquired Dacia.Do yourself a favour and go chek it out."

Descend below a government office building in a renaissance palazzo and find mosaic floors, bed rooms, saunas, hot baths of a top-tier Roman family circa the third century whose lavish home looked out upon the Roman forum and Trajan's column. If you find yourself hard-pressed to conjure the Roman forum in all its splendor from a couple of lingering columns, come here. Let technology do the work, and suddenly the room you are standing in has resplendently painted walls; the fragmentary floor is a complete mosaic; the bathing pool sloshes with water. The segment on the column of Trajan gives a terrific account of his on-again-off-again battle against the Dacians. Highly recommend."

I mean the tour is about to start and were only given a minute of choice to pay again or be stuck in an italian tour- we decided to just go for it in a foreign language. Anyway good thing my partner knows abit of latin so we were able to understand a bit of it. The tour is wonderful. Its a ruin but you will be standing on a thick glass on top it. You get to appreciate it because they give you a visualisation of what it looks like during its time. Taking out the unhelpful staff experience, I think anyone visiting Rome should consider booking a tour and I recommend that you make sure you are booking it in english. No cameras allowed btw."

Without it I would probably missed it.It is not visited by the hords of tourists but it is so educative and interesting. Unfortunately we are from Croatia. Tour was possible on one of the most spoken languages so didn't understand all like I would understand if it was on Croatian but it was enough to have the idea.Don't have to mention that my daughter was very impressed and asked if there was maybe another historical site explained in that way.Really good job they done.Bravo !!!!"

We were a bit skeptical about this site, having seen how audiovisual technology can be used to oversimplify and romanticize what ancient Rome must've been like. However, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the presentation and the historical accuracy of the descriptions. The tour was very informative yet entertaining. The designers of this exhibit did a terrific job making the archaeological findings accessible, both physically and intellectually. Highly recommended!"

For years I have been staring at the remnants of foundations of ancient buildings wondering what they must have looked like and the function the rooms played. In 1.5 hours, using existing archaeological digs and computer animation someone finally explained the mystery. You walk down under the existing ground level to the level of the ancient city of Rome where you visit a Villa (think rich people's house) that has been flattened. Through the use of computer generation this Villa is brought back to life with walls and ceilings recreated with computers while you stand in the middle of the room. Now for a few tips. Buy your ticket early - small groups only. It is dark and underground for you folks that might have the claustrophobia gene. Get close to the guide as the animated narrator does not allow sufficient time for the back of the group to enter the next chamber before the narration begins. There is little or no time for questions. I really don't think the guide could answer any complex question as the narration is pre-recorded. This may not be the best venue for children under age 9 or so - it just won't interest them and they have no place to go once the tour startes"

The interactive models tells stories about the surrounding building of the Column of Trajan - something which was completely new to me and put the whole archaeological area in perspective. The visit starts in the private bath of the Roman house and continues - over as I must say, as you walk on a glass floor covering the ruins - several rooms into the dining room. \"This is my favourite room\", the guide whispered to me. And it is truly beautiful - with remains of marble decorations, mosaics and painting. The guide is not talking, he is only leading you through the rooms and starts the multimedia show. The show is impressive and informative - and makes it possible to recognise the structures more clearly. In the end there is a very nice film about Trajan's Column and you will be able to catch a glimpse of the column form Roman ground level - several meters under the modern street level.All in all the most exiting exhibition to seen if you are interested in Rome's history."

Very interesting set of swimming pools/hot tubs. Some of the mosaic floors are intact, which is great to see.

Check on the website beforehand which tours are to be in your language, because obviously that is essential. You are also well-advised to book on the site. It is much better to be there with a small group, as inevitably you get in each other's way as you look through the glass floors, and strangers don't squeeze up together in the dark. As a way of explaining an archeological site this is really impressive. You get a genuine sense of the reality of ancient Roman life. At the end of the tour is a colossal broken column, which is presumed to be from the (lost) Temple of Trajan, and so they have a little video explaining Trajan's Column, which you then see from a door at the end of a passage, just to emphasise that the house really was at the centre of things.The entrance is on the left in the central courtyard of the palazzo, but the guard outside will direct you.

One has a new appreciation of ancient Roman history after this presentation and for all the ruins lying right outside the door. A tip for those challenged by walking over glass floors: don't look down! There will be plenty of time to look down once you have stopped at the next point in the tour. Walk with your eyes straight ahead as if you were walking across a normal floor and it will be much easier."

A small cafe and bathrooms are in the couryard next to the museum entrance."

Please note that if you have the Roma Pass, the tour is covered and free, but you must still make a reservation. The English tour was at 1:30 p.m. and although the woman checking us in at 1 p.m. was less than welcoming (I think she resented our Roma pass as she tried to charge us 10 Euros, but I had the Rome pass book with me, and had mentioned it when making the reservation) the tour proper was really informative and so well done.People with problems standing for long periods should know that there is no sitting down until the very end. There was a pause in a gift shop. Just as you exit the gift shop there were two benches. Once people started sitting down (no one was buying souvenirs), the tour progressed. Coincidence? Not sure.I would absolutely recommend taking the 1.5 hours to do this tour."

It sounds kind of cheesy but is really cool. It really helps you visualize what the buildings looked like back then and helps you understand many of the other popular sites where the buildings are basically ruins.You need reservations to visit and you can buy them online at their website. As others have mentioned, it appears as though if you show up you can usually buy tickets for the next guided tour (you can only go as a guided tour). The price (around 10 euros) is an excellent deal considering you get a tour with it. The Roma pass does work here, but you cannot book online and have to call them to book manually if you wish to use the pass.As a tip, the washrooms here at clean, free and without lineups. If you are in the city center you can use the facilities here. When you enter the building, go straight past the first few offices until you reach the courtyard.

Hands down, this was the most amazing attraction we visited - Galleria Borghese was second. Two or three stories underground, beneath the 16th century palace, are the ruins of an incredibly well-preserved 4th century high-class home. For an hour and a half (during which time you never glance at your watch) you walk over glass floors looking down into the various rooms as very exact/high tech colored lasers and other effects illuminate several sections of the ruins so you can tell exactly what you are seeing. All this while a well written narrative is broadcast in the darkness around you. It's like being in the middle of the most well produced history channel program but being able to witness the CGI recreation with your own eyes. We did not find it difficult to locate. Once you see Trajan's column, you're a block away. It's a yellow multi-story building w/ flags out front and a red sign bearing the website's logo. They have limited English tours each day (that frequently sell out) and they require a reservation with an early arrival time to pick up your tickets. We had purchased the Roma Pass and were able to get the discounted price. Tip: I had trouble booking the tickets with my Google translate on, once I flipped it back to Italian it worked no problem - just in case anyone else runs into that issue."

Our guide revealed an archaeological site laid out beneath a reinforced glass floor. We were encouraged to walk out onto the floor and explore the room. And then the show started.Over the next 90 mins we walked in wonder from one room to another as a narrative explained the remains of the roman villa and bath house and a digital light show brought the villa and the family that lived there to life.Best 10 Euros we spent that weekend."

Andthat\u2019s exactly what you should do with Domus Romane: book your tickets ahead and prevent missing to see this marvelous place. We were lucky to have a wonderful host/hotel owner, who recommended us this place, which we would otherwise miss and it would be such a loss\u2026 The groups are limited (when you see the place, you will find out why), so I think that you shloud book at least one week earlier. If possible, plan your visit to Domus prior to other archeologicalattractions (Colosseum, Forum\u2026), because you will learn a lot about Romans and theirconcept of leaving, building\u2026You will understand much better all those other (more famous) attractions afterwards.We come from a country which was in the Roman period under their rule and have seen many relicts, tombs, remains of palaces, etc. But in spite of that, stepping into the Domus\u2019 underground and seeing how the old Romans actually lived, was a miraculousexperience. Although being slightly claustrophobic, I didn\u2019t feel any anxiety, because the visual and sound impressions were so captivating, that I didn't have the time to think about anything else. The whole project has been excellently planned and executed; you will experiencehow the old and modern cooperate in the best possible way. The use of modern computer technologies to recreate and visualise the relicts found here trully contributes to the overall experience, which for us, was like travelling through time and coming into 3-4 century A.D. At moments, I felt like I was disturbing the people who lived here and whose presence can be felt even nowadays. The oral part is also very, very good. I got the impression that the team of best archeologists, art historians and writers was gathered to write the story which leads you from one room to another. All in all, fabulos experience and a highly recommended tour!"

They have tours in different languages and they last an hour and a half each. A maximum of 15 people are allowed on each tour. It's quite near Piazza Venezia, and a quite look on google maps shows exactly where the museum is located. It has big signs outside the museum so it is quite hard to miss. We arrived 20 minutes before the tour started and waited in the courtyard before it begun. At first it seemed a little confusing as you are walking on glass above the ruins. The tour is by an audio/video recordings. So there are no problems understanding what is being said as the recordings are of a high quality. I would definitely recommend this tour. I learned so much about life in Ancient Rome. I particularly liked the explanation of Trajans column. "

Great attraction, which I found very useful to visit before heading to the Roman Forum, as lights and video is overlayed onto the excavated ruins to give you a virtual picture of how the ruins may have looked in Roman times. You walk around on a glass floor over the excavations \u2013 first in a gym/bath-house and the second main room is a house. Although mainly rocky ruins, they have managed to salvage mosaic floors and roman roads, ceramics and other bits and pieces and it is truly amazing to think there is plenty more of this under your feet as you walk around Rome. The multimedia tour helps to bring the ruins to life.An unexpected treat at the end is about Trajan's Column, which gives a virtual reconstruction of the column in colour (as they believe it once was) and talks through what each of the scenes carved into the marble represents. The conquest of Dacia, present day Romania. It\u2019s one of those many structures in Rome where you can\u2019t help but wonder how the Romans managed to make it!The entry fee is a bargain for what you get, you must book in advance (we bought our ticket online) for a set time \u2013 and make sure you select the tour in your own language! There are limited tours a day so you should book as far in advance as you can. Our group was ever so slightly on the large side (it can make it hard to properly see down below the glass with a larger group) so I hope when you visit you get a smal group \u2013 but visit you absolutely must!"

The audio, video, laser and visual techniques are outstanding. Walking around on glass floors viewing what's beneath you is cool and unique. The only issue with this museum is sadly the human element - how sad for all the enormous effort and expense the curators put into every other aspect of the museum.

There is one set of stairs and the rest of the tour is flat walking on a glass floor through which you can see the ruins of a very wealthy and recently excavated Roman home. It is amazing as so much is in tact. Lights illuminate sections of the home's excavation and an audio narration explains what you are looking at. These narrations are in a variety of languages, so ask for your language when you book your tour. This tour visually brings the site to life through computer overlays and enhancements so that you can \"see\" what your brain is trying to imagine a place once looked like. It surrounds you so that you are part of the home as it was. I loved it! It is by far the most unique way of viewing an ancient archeological site. The tour lasts about 1 1/2 hours. There is a very small (one room) museum of some of the artifacts discovered in the excavation; however, many of the artifacts lay as they were found in the site. The museum is part of the tour and it is small; you will see it quickly and the kids won't have time to be bored. There is a small gift shop also a few minute stop on the tour, and a documentary film about the excavation going on outside the Roman house you are touring. You will have time to look at it after the film viewing, but since that site is outside and open, you can view it after the tour at your leisure. This is by far the most unique way to view a site and become part of its history. Book in advance and don't miss it. You will be so glad you saw it and viewed it both in its natural and enhanced state. So unique, so well done, and so worth it."

It's a modern way to visit the house of a noble family in the ancient Rome because tourists walk on a glass floor that allows them to see everything under their feet. Walls, steps and everything is lighted up as the story goes on. The story teller is a famous Italian presenter of science/culture and scientific TV programm. At the end of the vist there's a part dedicated to the Traiano's column.Everything is so well explained that it's really exciting! Certainly you shouldn't miss this visit! Personally I do think it is even better than visiting Colosseum or Fori Imperiali.

Perhaps it was because there were 16 people in our group (I think a better maximum number would be around 12), but we found that the recorded descriptions and highlighting of the different sections had often started before all the group had assembled or even before everyone was in the room. In addition, we were quite crowded around some of the sections, making it difficult to see and appreciate what we were supposed to be looking at. This spoiled our experience of what I think could have been very interesting. A lot of work had obviously gone into the design, lighting, projections and recorded descriptions, to make it easy to imagine life for the residents and slaves in the Domus, so it was a shame that we could not take full advantage. All in all, this was probably a worthwhile visit, but I wouldn't put it above many of the other attractions of Rome, especially if you are in a large group of visitors"

They raved about it when they got home. Why? Because it is hard to actually visualize how Romans lived. Yes, you can visit the Terme di Caracalla, The Forum, the many churches and piazzas in Rome, museums etc, etc., But this exhibition brings ancient Rome alive; you can actually see the rooms, the baths, the floors, the steps, the outdoor road, the middle age walls over the Roman domus. You can see the rain on the floor in the garden. Outstanding exhibition: a multimedia masterpiece. This year they even include a film on the Colonna di Traiano. Wow! You can actually see and UNDERSTAND the history carved on the column. All tourists should make a point of booking a guided tour.

You move throughout the villa foundations, following an audio-visual presentation that shows you how the villa would have appeared in its heyday. It's really fantastic!If you are new to Roman ruins, this site is probably one of the most informative, and I would suggest it as a first stop to help you understand what you might see at Ostia Antica or Pompeii for example. If you've seen lots of Roman ruins, this one is the most uniquely presented. Please note: The site is not a Disney experience (i.e. suitable for all ages and physical abilities). The site could be improved with web bookings and more helpful front desk staff.I would highly recommend this site for the vast majority of travellers, but there are some things that others might benefit from knowing:1) The tour itself is underground in an, at times, dimly lit, ancient ruin. Anyone with compromised mobility or eyesight might find this a real difficulty. 2) Many of the floors are glass (which gives and excellent view of what's below). Some people might find this disorienting to walk on.3) The audio acompaniment is informative, clear and easy to follow (I did my tour in Italian, so I am assuming the English version is of the same quality). However, the guide would collect the group and give little chats, often in cramped viewing platforms. Unless you were at the very front of the group, it was impossible to hear what the guide was saying.4) If you have a Roma Pass: Although this site is included in the pass, you still have to book it in advance. This is easy to do over the phone and can be done well in advance. There are tours in various languages, and the English ones appear to sell out the most quickly. The phone staff (very helpful) will ask for credit card payment, so be sure to say you have a Roma pass. I agree with other reviewers that the desk staff are unhelpful and borderline rude (even if you deal with them completely in Italian). 5) The place you pick up tickets is tucked inside in the courtyard of the main building, so give yourself time to find it. After reading this on previous reviews, we decided to drop by the day before to find the site and to to confirm our booking.6) It's sort of a one-way tour, so some parents may want to encourage kids to use the bathroom before heading into the underground. Some younger children might find it a bit loud and dark (i.e. scary)7) Some people might find it clautrophobic, but on the other hand, you are in a small group and there is plenty of space away from the viewing platforms.I think most travellers would have an awesome experience, especially a first-time visitor to Rome.

I personally found it annoying that some people on the tour were talking continuously throughout it.

After seeing the foro romanum this exhibition is more gratifying because it uses modern technologies (lighting, sound and digital effects) to recreate how the rooms looked like when they were still lived in. When we visited in April 2013 all the technical problems reported by other travelers seemed to be resolved.Just keep in mind that tours need to be booked well in advance, as they only allow 20 persons at a time. If you can't cope with standing for a long time, this may not be for you. The visit lasts for a good 1,5 hours and there's not many chances to sit and have a break. Well, not until you get to the second part of the tour: the movie analyzing the story depicted on Trajan's column, a great complement and very well explained. Afterwards you will see the column from a different point of view!"

I booked the English Speaking tour and kept it a secret until time for the tour. You will need to prebook and purchase your tickets prior to arrival. I checked the site before we left and there had been some concerns that the projections in some of the rooms were having technical difficulty but when we arrived, it was working perfectly and our guide guided us to the exact spots that we should be standing in order to enjoy the site to the fullest. We had a small group as 4 people that had booked did not show up, but it starts right on time. Do not be late. We enjoyed this and my family is still talking about it. It is wonderful and very well done. Congratulations to all who worked on this presentation."

I was a little disappointed and thought that I could have spent my money some place else. The tour is ok. We walked around the basement of the building , looking through the glass floors under which are the ruins of an old roman house of almost 2000 years ago. With some projections of lights and colors they try to recreate the house the way they think it was, based on evidence they found, and at the same time they give us a lot of information about their history.I guess if you have plenty of time in Rome you can spare a couple of hours on this place. But if you are on tight schedule - we were there for 4 full days - I would suggest other amazing places."

We walked round for an age and when we asked a bar owner near Trajan's Column, he pointed down! We were standing on top of it. To find the entrance, you need to go to round to the other side of this building, there you see a courtyard , guarded by security. On showing them details of the attraction, we were let through. There is a small coffee shop here too which we were told was for the local police, but tourists are allowed to use it too. Really cheap coffee and a great stop before and after the tour. Probably the cheapest refreshments in town but probably not accessible due to security for non users of the tour. There is also a toilet next door, with no queue! Worth keeping in mind for emergencies as Rome is notorious for its lack of public toilet facilities!You begin the tour by going down a glass ramp over the original staircase. A really strange sensation, but you soon get used to it. You then pass from room to room , standing all the time on a glass floor and looking down as various areas that light up and on occasions an animation also takes place, bringing the room back to life.  Our two children, both 8-9 were kept engaged in a concept that is difficult to excite the young, especially when they saw children's images and their voices recreated. Lots of details were given that gave areal flavour for life in Rome during the period of Empire and the lighting effects were very clever. English actor narrates which helps - the tour is classy and put together xyremely well. Earlier reviewers mentioned a video about Trajan's column, this was not available to us, but we did see the base of the column using a tunnel from WW2. We almost missed this part though as the tour guide led us into the shop and we presumed this was the end. A great tour and definitely worth doing if you want to discover what life was like for the wealthy roman urbanite (the sophistication and quality of life for the wealthy is jaw dropping) but for us this attraction loses a point as we were denied the Trajen video which would have topped off the tour as this was virtually next door to the ancient house and an important view for the residents of the time."

I learned about the Domus Romane di Palazzo Valentini on TripAdvisor and decided to go there our first day in Rome - it seemed like a great way to ease into our vacation, taking into account jet-lag, etc. I highly recommend this tour, though the day we went there were technical difficulties with one of the tapes so we were escorted to a separate room while they rebooted the tape. After the problem was corrected we went back (adding disjointed down time to the tour). The guide did his best to fix the issues, and all was resolved in due time. Our guide, while quite pleasant, did not have good command of the English language (there are several English language tours a day, and we supposedly were on one). He tried his best to convey the information - but I think the experience would have been 5 star if we had a guide that was more fluent. The Domus itself is quite interesting, and the original walls, floors, etc, are displayed in a unique fashion using plexiglass (see-through) floors, etc, so that you can see the layers of history under your feet. It can be a bit dizzying to walk up and down the plexiglass stairs, so someone that has balance issues might find it challenging.I would definitely recommend this site, but hope they will hire tour guides with better English language skills for the English Language Tours."

If I hadn't read all the raving reviews on tripadvisosr, I would probably have expected less and possibly been more impressed with this place. Our 'English speaking' guide didn't speak much English and there were times during the tour that he was supposed to tell us things, but the recorded information that was played during the tour was good, clear, and loud, and we probably learned enough from it. Walking on a transparent floor is a unique experience! Took me a while to trust that I wouldn't fall to the floor below! Walking on it confronted me with angst at first, and continued to amuse me! I'm probably a little jaundiced in feeling that if you've seen one ruin, you've seen them all. What you see in Domus Romane is remarkable, but what do you see in Rome that isn't remarkable? I'm not unhappy I went, but I wouldn't go a second time. Would I recommend it? I'm not sure. But I wouldn't try to discourage you from going if you told me you were going.On the other hand, I really liked the short film at the end about Trajan's Column!If you decide to go to Domus Romane, here's how to get there...THE FIRST WAY TO GET THERE - If you go to Trajan's Column (which is across the street from the huge, white Victor Emanuel monument), you will be right across the smaller street from a grey building with the word \"PREFECTURE\" over the door. That's the building, and this is the 'back door'. Go in this door, and go straight ahead through the next door. Keep going and you will find yourself in a small, nondescript courtyard. Cross the courtyard, keep going and you will end up in a big, real courtyard. The Domus Romane office is all the way down on the right.THE SECOND WAY TO GET THERE - The main entrance to the building faces Quatro de Novembre street, and is immediately across the street from MUSEO della CERE (The Wax Museum, in English.) and that name is emblazoned across a very visible yellow background and stretches along the top of the ground floor above the door to the Museo della Cere. Go into the big courtyard of the \"PREFECTURE\" building and the Domus Romane office is the first one on the left.Tours are limited to about 15 people. We went in mid March and our English tour was full. There are two English tours a day.There is a very small, limited service cafe next door. It has a few cold sandwiches in a glass case, and various drinks. The toilets for the courtyard offices ares next to the cafe.Spirit"

It is a hidden gem and a great value compared to other sights in the city. I loved the light shows and the intimacy of the \"museum-y\" sections of the tour. We booked an English tour and while we didn't have any trouble understanding our guide, one of the families had trouble understanding him. It probably helped this was the third set of baths we had toured so we knew exactly what he meant when he was explaining the rooms. The main focus of the tour is a mansion, probably belonging to a senator, but at the end you get to see a couple giant columns from the nearing forgotten Temple of Trajan that stood near his Column. At the very end he showed us a passage that was part of an wary 20th century bunker that comes out near the foot of the Column it was an unbelievable view."

We were unaware that one should have reservations, but we were lucky enough to find availability on the next tour conducted in Italian. We know just enough Italian to have had no problems understanding the tour, but if you do not speak some Italian it is better to book the English tour. The tour lasted a little over an hour and was fascinating from start to finish. It was wonderful to watch how the Italians of all ages in our group delighted in this multimedia glimpse into an ancient Roman home. There is nothing phoney or overly animated about this tour as you are in the underground ruins of a real Roman villa. Before Nero's Domus Aurus was closed to the public we had the chance to tour it and we agree that Le Domus Romane was a better experience."

From the remaining mosaics, art work and marble the excavators were able to present what is probably a fairly accurate depiction of a wealthy life style at the peak of Rome's power. Judging by the lavishness of the home and the prime location next to Tajan's column, I would guess this was the home of a very wealthy Roman, perhaps a senator or general. The videos brought the ruins to life and gave me a greater appreciation of other sites in the city that have been scavenged of their precious materials. The video explanation of Trajan's column was very informative and entertaining.Our guides english was adequate and answered my questions to my satisfaction."

After sorting out booking the tickets (by telephone - i must say it was one of the best automatic telephone queuing services i have used) we did enjoy the tour of the excavation. Standing directly above the ruins, on a glass floor, was disorientating. Our main complaint was that we did not have enough time in each section. Lights went on and off and if you were not in the right position you missed the object being talked about. An extra 5 minutes in each room with all the lights on would have made the experience complete for us. It is an interesting tour.

We were looking forward to being able to see the ruins, find out the history behind them and see the much talked about 'bringing to life', whilst we did experience this and what we did see was informative the whole experience could have been much better and definitely did not live up to the hype created on trip advisor. We bought our tickets online the day before, this sells fast so book early if you do want to experience it, they were 10 each plus 1.50 processing fee, you can also buy them from the bookstore in largo Argentina. You pick the physical ticket up on the day at the office.Upon entering you are led down some stairs to the first room, be warned the majority of the experience is walking upon glass floors! Which does take a little getting used to! The experience started off well and the narration explains the ruins below whilst brining them to life using very modern technology, which in fairness was very impressive and a great way of getting you to imagine the ruins, and see exactly what part of the ruins is what. You also see some videos of what the room may have looked like and are asked to imagine what the house was like.After the first room, the whole experience on this occassion went downhill. The second and third narrated parts were not working, nor were the multimedia effects. We pretty much skipped them as the guide didnt give too much information, whilst he probably was knowledgable there may have been a language barrier. We then browsed artifacts, before having to rush back to the next room as the show had stared and no one had told us!The experience continues and you learn more about the house, the next two areas were fully immersive with the multimedia effects, I wont explain what you learn as you'll find out when your there! Part way through our guide changed to a young gent who's english wasn't great, the next room was skipped for some reason, i'm not sure if many of the group noticed it, but there was a whole area skipped before walking out to the part way through gift shop... the reason was probably that the voice and effects were broken. We learned nothing here, and were led to a waiting area for five minutes.The end gives you an insight into the Trajan Column outside, which was interesting, you sit and watch a video and then are led to see the column. The experience should take 1hr and 30 minutes, we were definitley not in there for that long because of the broken narration and effects.We found the whole experience unorganised and average as we missed out on three parts due to the difficulties. If you like history and want to learn more then go for it, we found some parts very interesting but the whole experience was disappointing."

Opening its door in 2010; and to say the least well presented, very good graphics and extremely good for all the tourists who have had to bare the \"italian accent\" as this is all recorded from an english professional. It really gives u an insight to what Rome was and how things were built, i'm not going to ruin your amazement as you'll pleasantly surprised.For tourist information: you need to book one day in advance online so you assure your ticket especially during tourist seasons (summer).From your roman born adviser!"

Starts slow but builds, with an excellent ending video on Trajan's Column. Not for those with equilibrium difficulties or a fear of the dark. The sensation of walking on plexigalss (or whatever) takes a little getting used to. I don't see it as a #1 attraction, but it can certainly make a top 20 list. I booked the \"English\" tour on line with no difficulty. If you happen to be a grandparent, it happens to be a two minute walk from \"Little Big Town\", Rome's new, largest in country (4 story), excellent toy store ( and \"yes\" grandma, they'll ship )."

They used sounds, narration, plexiglass floors and projection technology to show us how the ruins we see one meter below our feet actually looked like, on the ruins themselves! One bad thing is the fact that the group size is too big (15 - 20 people) for such small environments, so sometimes people would simply miss the fast projections and would not be able to move from point A to B in time, while things were lit up. They should really consider limiting the number of people to 10 - 12 (max) at a time. Also, they were out of water when I went, so the caf\u00e9 and bathrooms were not working properly."

So you have seen some of the amazing sights of the Roman ruins, now you have to visit this attraction to bring it all to life. This is possibly one of the best value for money tours you could take. Sadly no photography is allowed in this place, this disappointed me greatly, but the experience was vivid enough to imprint itself on the memory. The visitor is guided through a series of chambers built over an actual Roman palazzo, excavated underneath civic buildings. One walks over a glass floor which is suspended only a foot or two above the original floor below. This can be a tad unsettling at first, but as the incredible scene of this excavation appears before you, any anxiety fades quickly. Any difficulty you would have in visualising life 'back in the day' is taken of through very creative use of overlaid projection. Nothing is left to the imagination as a narrator brings it all into sharp relief. We had no problem booking this tour online and picked up our tickets at the venue an hour before the scheduled start. Drinks and food are available in a cafe/ canteen area right next door to this attraction, which is in the square of this government building."

Some of the ruins are very well preserved and really make you gape in wonder. The tour takes about an hour and a half and we highly recommend it. It's good value and the groups are quite controlled so you get a chance to look at the ruins, although in some of the smaller chambers you sometimes have to peer through people and their legs to get a better view.We recommend booking online at least a week in advance.

Walls, rooms, kitchens, decorations are seen in pure form and living color. All through the 1+ hour tour, I kept saying, \"how did they do that?!\"The Palazzo is still fully operational and has government offices that surrounds the archeological museum. There are guards standing at the entrance that will question you, just tell them that you're here to buy tickets or that you are taking the tour. We tried buying tickets online but their website isn't very user friendly and very slow. A very interesting history lesson for 9.50 euro/person and kept us dry from the unpredictable weather! the only sad thing is, taking photos are not allowed inside."

Strangely we went to two very similar museums on the same day, both affording a chance to explore the hidden history of Rome beneath it's modern foundations.Early in the day we went to Balbi Crypt, which to be honest was poor, there isn't much to see, and you are simply led from room to room downstairs, looking at walls of rubble and vaguely realising they are part of some sort of old plumbing system/water tank system. The slightly offish lady doesn't make any effort to explain anything to you, and there are no explanatory signs. One of our party asked her a question which she answered with some depth of understanding, so if she's going to the effort of taking us round the tour, surely tell us what we're looking at.Afterwards we looked on Tripadvisor and saw this as the top-rated place to go, so went along and booked a place for the English-speaking tour in the afternoon. Again you are led under the city, through different rooms and areas. What an incredible difference though, the guide is organised and informative, computer graphics are used to superimpose onto the remains  how it would have looked in Ancient times. It was revelatory, seeing history come to life under your feet! The mosaics are stunning, the fallen tower amazing, and emerging into an alcove to see the Trajan's Column a great finale.I would greatly recommend this tour, I started the day thinking Rome was a bit boring and ended it amazing and enthused!"

Very easy to find, a short walk towards the Victor Emanuel monument then a fast left before you enter the Piazza, up about a block or two and opposite the Wax Musuem in a rather mundane goverment building. Enter the building through the front arch and ask for the Domus Valentini and it is to your left once you enter the courtyard. The tickets need to be purchased online, as there are a limited number of tours, in English each day, and a very small group is allowed in at one time. We did this on our recent trip and had no problems finding the attraction or with the tour.The tour takes you down into the cellar of this building where upon excavating for a carpark, a Roman villa was discovered. This tour is an audio/visual wonder above the villa looking down into the rooms of the villa guided by the audio and visually by the enhanced lighting used to illuminate the areas under discussion, truely striking indeed. The tour runs about 11/2 hours and I would do it again and again on my trips to Rome, it was so interesting.One warning I would have is that the tour guide was of little value, other than to be sure folks moved from room to room, and you have a very odd feeling in the dark walking on glass above the villa. It takes abit of getting used to and older folks may want to be aware that your depth preception is thrown off abit by the dark, and the sheer glass that you are walking on and the small rooms, so give yourself a bit of time to adjust."

The museum is special because it uses media and technology to tell the history of the structures and the process of their discovery. For example, you walk into a dim room with a glass floor, the ruins visible beneath your feet. A narrator guides you through the room, a light shines on areas of the ruins, one at a time, as they are explained. A broken floor mosaic is shown, and images are projected on its missing portions to show you what it would look like, new and whole.It's a creative and well done museum!"

So: find the column; walk into the courtyard of the building behind it, and look to your right for the sign. Also: Make sure to call or use the website to make reservations. If you didn't: stop by. When we were there, a couple were able to get reservations for two days later (despite the fact that, on the website, I hadn't been able to get tickets for that day!). Don't give up!"

Ancient roman villas lie, quite literally, in the basement of a government building (Palazzo Valentini). These villas have been conserved and are now an archaeological site. The floor is covered with acrylic so you see ancient steps and floors under your feet. The site is interpreted with computer-generated graphics to show you what the buildings looked like in antiquity and what happened to them over time. Quite often in Rome, something that looks like a pile of rubble was once a beautiful building; this exhibit helps train your eye to look for clues as to what something once was. It also sheds light into the work of archaeologists digging through the layers and layers of time that is the Eternal City. We found this exhibit very worthwhile, and we're old hands at Rome!"

The visual effects are professional and make the tour of the site so interesting. The tour is not too long. It's almost as if you are transported back to the time when this domus was alive with people. You can actually visualize participating in ancient Rome life at the top. The spa, the pool, the flooring, the water and sewer system, just everything about this place stands out. It is a little difficult to find the location for the beginning of the tour so allow yourself an extra 15 to 30 minutes to find it. The entrance is in the courtyard. We did have an issue with the tickets which I purchased by calling them four months before our trip from the US to Rome. Keep the number they give you if you call to make your reservation. By the way, when we were looking for this place, we asked a tourist office person it's location, and she said this site is known by all present day Romans and is considered one of their most important sites. She even wanted to know how I got the tickets since she said she's been wanting to go herself. It is slightly dark at times of the tour. Perhaps they need to add some minimal floor lighting. There were some glass steps to negotiate, but they were careful to point those out to you. I suspect someone may have fallen on them in the past. The group was a little larger than it should have been since there were some areas that were too small to accommodate more than just a few people. Yet our group was polite and shared space. I still think they should make the groups smaller though. Go and enjoy life of the ancient Roman elite."

My Italian didn't extend to being able to explain that it was already 9:30 and I was made to wait outside. FInally got let into the museum at 9:45 and booked an English tour for 1:30pm. Bear in mind this is a government administration building and they don't really tolerate tourists just mooching around the place which is why pre-booking is essential. They only discovered the ruin when they wanted to build an underground car-park for the government workers, so they are an accidental tourist sight and hence the outside staff seem to be reluctant participants. The staff in the museum were great though. Book this 2-3 days ahead - more in peak times. If you turn up at the right time with a ticket you will ushered through to then experience one of the best guided shows to Roman domestic building. You walk on a glass floor 3-4 feet above the ruin which is illuminated in sections and shows the basement gymnasium, spa and rooms of a grand Roman Domus. Lighting projections then show the pool filled with water and complete the missing mosaics etc to show how it really was. As the others say, best experience in Rome. Quite a few stairs for those with dodgy knees. Not a place for a stroller."

The tour lasted over an hour and a half and cost us only 10 euros each - less with a Roma card. Great value for money. Only difficulty was trying to book it - couldn't find a way to do it on the website (although it advised to ring a number, we were reluctant as our Italian is minimal), so we had to turn up on the morning and book for later in the day - probably not possible when busy, or if staying across town."

It is a stunningly good interactive experience and a must see for anyone. It is the architectural remains of the original Roman house (or Domus) on the site and is truly stunningly presented. It's a bit odd and very disorienting walking over glass floors, but well worth it. At the end of the tour there is an explanation of Trajans column as well, very interesting.The Palazzo is quite easy to find, go to the Victor Emmanuel monument, and across the road to Trajans column and walk down the alleyway leading on to the column, you will find a signpost there, when you reach the main street turn right as you are actually walking down the side of the Palazzo. Go in the main entrance, which will probably have a lot of police around as it appears to be a police headquarters. When we went there was some kind of function going on and it was not obvious where we should go. The entrance to the Domus Romane is in the ground floor courtyard. If taking the english language tour, it is essential to book as there are only 15 places and only one english language tour per day. I must say the people in the entrance area are not the friendliest, but the tour guide was very nice. There are quite a lot of stairs so not really suited to anyone with mobility difficulties.In the upstairs courtyard, there are loos and a cafe, we didn't eat there but it looked o.k.I honestly can't recommend this tour too highly."

During the first part of the visit, you walk over a glass floor and see a house that has been excavated below you. Amazing!!! I had never experienced anything like it. They use visual effects to reconstruct parts of the house below you that don't exist anymore to show you what it must have looked like.Later in the visit, there is a room where you see an audio visual presentation of what the city of Rome looked like when it was most powerful. Also, this was really amazing.The only small problem I had was that the staff were quite unfriendly. When we checked in, they weren't very nice. One staff member leads you through the whole exhibit. He seemed irritated to answer questions and his demeanor was a bit off putting.

Booking tickets in advance is pretty much essential as only about twenty people are allowed on the one English spoken visit at 1.30 p.m. each day. Don't be put off when you arrive in a pretty uninteresting Government office block as what you are going to see is underneath it. This is 21st Century technology meeting 1st Century reality and with fantastic results. You can't fail to enjoy it and thanks again to the other reviewers for putting it in first place. It was the best place we saw in Rome."

Best visited after you've been to the usual ruins/sites, the novel feature here is that in addition to viewing the ruins themselves, a light and projector display will bring the original ruins to 'life', allowing you to better understand and see what the original was like. After having been to many archeological sites, we found this experience put all the previous ruins in a new light. There is only 1 (or 2) tour in english each day and they usually fill up, so walking in is unlikley to work, except for 1 or 2 people. Far better to get tickets ahead of time online or through a concierge. Total time of multimedia tour is just over 1 hour.

You go downstairs and stand on a glass floor while a voiceover tells you about what you are looking at. Lights are used to point out individual elements and fill in how things must have looked - a bit like standing in the middle of a TV history documentary. The voiceover is engaging and builds to increasingly interesting finds as it moves along. Towards the end you get a fascinating video, and the chance to sit down for a bit, about the inscriptions on Trajan's Column and what they actually mean (and the artistry that went into them), and then you get the payoff of going down a corridor to see the actual Column just outside the building.At about 1.5 hours, most of it standing up, I was a bit concerned my 11 year old would get bored, especially as he had let me know exactly how tedious he had found the Pantheon and Vatican Museum, but he liked it.There was the added bonus that this tour was underground, early in the afternoon, when it was in the 90s outside. It therefore neatly gave us something interesting to do while staying out of the sun for a while.I didn't have a problem booking, but I would imagine it is best to book early as the tour groups are limited in size. Price is very reasonable."

The tour is 2.5 hours long (too long) & they only allow 10 people in each group (which is nice) but it is difficult to get tickets at high tourism times. The tour is all indoors with AC which was the only nice thing about this tour. The tour shows pieces of a mansion that used to stand where Palazzo Valentini is now. Trajan's column is right outside the back door (part of the tour). The tour is taped so a live person is not the moderator. The entire tour is just like a movie (but while walking room to room)& then at the end of the tour, they ask you to sit down & watch an actual movie. I fell asleep because it was so boring. Save your time and money ( I believe it costs about 36 euros for 2 people) and go see something more interesting in Rome -- there is so much to choose from!"

Having been to Rome a few times and seen the m\"must see\" attractions, we were really happy to have this small museum recommended to us by an Italian friend. We we were very lucky to get tickets only a few days before our trip. The same friend called on our behalf, as the website didn't seem to ever load properly to indicate whether tickets were actually available. We paid over the phone and arranged to pick up the tickets just before our scheduled time. The museum entrance itself is located within the courtyard of a municipal building of some sort - beautiful on it's own, although it took a few minutes to locate the correct set of doors leading to the Domus. They are on the left about midway back in the courtyard. The tour was limited to about 16 people (our party alone was 7) and was conducted in English. They seems to have spared no expense in this small but really interesting museum, which is broken into two distinct sections. The first, as other note, is the most compelling, showing in great detail the ruins of a wealthy Roman home at the height of the Empire. The wealth and technology of the time are really astounding, and computer graphics and lasers recreate the excavations to their original spender right before your eyes. The ruins themselves, mostly under glass floors, are impressive on their own, but the technology used to bring them to life was a real treat. The second part of the museum focuses on the nearby Trajan's column. As a history buff, I found the detailed description of the story told on the column's reliefs interesting, but I can see why some reviews find this to be a distraction from the earlier focus on the house itself. If nothing else, it gives the visitor a chance to sit down and reflect a bit longer on the whole scene. Le Domus Romane sets a new standard for bring the past to life, and will hopefully serve as a model for other museums in future."

The tour is pre recorded but with added assistance from a member of staff who politely guides you through the surprisingly vast complex. The audio is very clear and interesting. The accompanying light show / projection lit reconstructions are brilliant and the music adds the correct level of drama. The bonus is the very welcome sit down and video presentation about Trajan's Column at the end of the tour. We did this tour as well as the much lauded Vatican Scavi Tour on our trip and - though it surprises me to admit - the Domus tour was SO much better! You need to book the Domus Romane tour in advance as only about twenty people are allowed in at a time and English language tours are limited to a handful per day. My advice is book online a couple of weeks before you go ( although it is not the easiest website to navigate and it does not like mobile / Android based devices at all).The Domus Romane has the air of being one of Romes best kept secrets. Fortunately it is not a suitable venue for those god awful group / coach tours who constantly block up the hallways in the Vatican and take the shine off that experience somewhat.Obviously - if you have no real interest in Roman life / Roman history then perhaps the Domus (and indeed Rome itself) will not seem so interesting. If you like Time Team then this tour is pitched at that sort of level. Kids will love the glass floors and lights but are likely to lack interest in the commentary. Very young children especially will probably suffer with the humidity and some may be a little afraid of the darkness, so think carefully before taking very young children on this tour.Adults / teenagers with an interest in Roman life / Archaeology etc will love it. If you go on the tour early during your visit, it will certainly help you visualise how the ruins in the Forum / Palatine etc would have looked originally."

The technology is great, but the subject matter was boring for me. This is a 6th century house that was built over a 1st century house. At some point, they found the ruins of the original house and its features. The tour leads through the different rooms, and through digital images and projections, shows what the house would have looked like in its heyday. The tour finishes with a twenty minute movie of the history and meaning of the oblesk v the square that the house overlooks. We both found the voiceover cheesy and overdramatic but it was a nice break from Romes summer heat."

Just be aware that it involves a lot of stairs as you are walking below the existing Renaissance Palazzo to reach the ruins (that's how far underground the ancient city of Rome lies) and there are no places to sit down. I did see some wheelchair signs but the guide said she didn't know of any wheelchair access. There is a basic tour which will show you all of the ruins (Riditto) and an extended tour (Intero) which adds another 30 minutes and presents an audio-visual history of Trajan's Market and Trajan's Column (to which the ruins are adjacent). I took the extended tour and it was interesting to learn about Trajan's Column but if you skip it and save the extra 2\u20ac you won't be missing any of the ruins which is what the visit is really about. I took some photos using my \"museum mode\" and they came out pretty good which just the existing lighting."

I reserved the English tour for a day in August several months in advance via the online site with no problem. (Though, to be fair, I've lived in Italy now and have figured out these things a little.) I picked up our tickets about an hour before the 1:30 tour and we waited in a shaded section of the courtyard until the tour began. It is all inside, which is nice in the heat of August, but even the best air conditioning can not fully battle the Roman heat at the heart of the day. As mentioned in many reviews, this experience uses glass floors to allow you to fully see ruins of this discovered palace. The lighting and video in here is top notch and allows you to see what the palace might have looked like back in the day. They'll move you around from room to room and the guide tries to help everyone fit appropriately so everyone can see. There were less than 15 in our group, which was good, because in some spaces, that's all that will fit. It is definitely worth a visit. Most kids will like it, but the younger ones won't understand everything and you stand the entire time until the last 10 minutes. This experience is really cool, and they could easily charge two or three times what they do...not that I want to give them any ideas."

In Palazzo Valentini they make the ruins come to life by using projection on the floor, ceiling and the walls, as well as showing you computer generated images of what the houses used to look like. Toward the end of the tour they show a 20-minute documentary about Trajan's column and the story it tells about Trajan's conquest over the Dacia. After the movie they take you to one of the widows to see the column up close. They also talk about the theory of the existence of Trajan's temple and you can see the huge column laying under the glass floor which may prove that theory. The only negative thing is the booking process. The booking website was not working at all. I called the number on the screen and made reservations, but when we got to the museum it turned out the reservation had been made for a wrong museum. Luckily, there was another English tour a few hours later. It was definitely worth the money and the wait. By the way, you can get a reduced price ticket even by showing a current validated ATAC ticket. Full price is 10 euros, reduced is 8."

The museum itself is interesting enough, and I can see why people really like this place; it presents the information in a very Discovery Channel type way (i.e. you can just sit back an absorb information as you would while watching a television program), which might be a nice break for people who are tired of a more traditional museum education experience.

The entire Foro and ancient Domus Aura are below some extravagant and elegant Renaissance and other buildings. What you see is such a small portion of what is actually there. Poor Rome cannot even have an extensive underground transportation system because of all the antiquities below. This tour carries you through the Palazzo and then below to a stately residence of an important Roman citizen. The re-creation done with computers looks like HGTV but instead of modern day you are looking at a home from the Roman Empire. The parts of the floor one sees are beautiful and then the complete mosaic performed with the help of a computer is really worth seeing. It is a little over dramatic but I think the effect gives more impact to the experience. Warn little children that it gets dark but there is nothing scary. I loved the part of the tour which confirms the existence of the Temple to Traiano. The window view of the Colonna di Traiano is extra special. The entire description of the colonna reliefs is wonderful to anyone who cares about victories and battles. You need to book tickets to the event and make sure you sign up for the appropriate language. There is an inner courtyard that has a small bar where you can hang out if you have some extra time before or after your tour. I have been to Rome over 50 times and assure you that this is a must see. Rome is a city to be explored and the history of the place is everywhere you turn. Even in the basements."

When you go, the group is about 12 people, and there is an employee to guide you through, but most of the speaking is done by a recording. I didn't time how long it took, but it was about an hour. Most of what you'll see is underground so it is cool temperature wise. The multimedia helps bring to life what you are looking at which is great because essentially you are looking at ruins of an ancient house, but you are walking above it, looking down through a thick plexiglass floor. Maybe one day they can develop something like this when touring the roman forum!"

Our tour began with a seemingly bored young man leading us into a room with a glass floor. Aside from pointing out where we should stand, and turning lights on and off, the guides had no real purpose. The tour was \"led\" by an overly emotive voice over which can only be compared to Disney's Hall of Presidents and included more computer imagery than Avitar. While the ruins themselves were pretty amazing, the omnipresent \"Imagine if you will...\" pontificating was rather annoying. The tour concludes with a 20 minute video recounting the events depicted in each panel of the Trajan Column in great detail with, of course, CGI reenactments. The tour would be so much better if they did away with the voice overs and just had knowledgeable human guides walk you through."

A MUST is the Colosseum, the Forum, the Vatican, St. Peters. A MUST is San Giovanni, the Catacombs, the Pantheon. A MUST is the Trevi fountain, the Spanish Steps, the Borghese Gallery (Apollo and Daphne), A MUST is antipasto & wine while watching the sunset over Rome from the Pincio.

Where there is a partial mosaic floor, lights fill in the rest so that you can get a sense of its appearance when occupied by its inhabitants. The tour is narrated and highly informative; it provides a valuable perspective to help you view other excavations, such as Pompeii. Aside from the educational aspect, the museum is air-conditioned and provides a nice respite on a hot summer day. The sandwich shop next to the entrance is good and very reasonable."

It feels like being suspended and it is really cool, felt almost dizzy in the beginning. Then lasers, lights and virtual reconstructions will help you to learn how these places were made and will enhance your experience. This is going to be enjoyed also by people that could find museums boring. If you decide to go book well in advance, especially the English tours cause they get full very quickly as they allow just few people at the time. It is really a modern response to how with the help of technology we can go back in time and feel what it was felt. A futuristic way to be in the past. enjoy!"

The floor you walk on is thick plexiglass over a steel grid, which allows you to see the ancient structures below. A guide moves you from room to room and the tour is broadcast through speakers, giving details and other sounds to bring the space to life. Sections of floors and walls are highlighted; what isn't visible or clear is filled in using computer generated images, so you see how they may have looked originally, including colors and decorations. Because the villa is right door next to Trajan's Forum, there's a detailed explanation of the carvings on Trajan Tower after the villa tour. The tower is 13 stories high with images carved in marble that spiral upwards to recount Trajan's most impressive military battles. The villa owner must have been somebody very important or influential to have built his house in such a prime location.The number of people allowed on each tour is limited to about 12-15, so I recommend getting tickets well in advance. I booked on-line a few weeks before I planned to be in Rome and didn't have a problem getting a reservation. I think kids who are old enough to participate without getting antsy could enjoy this as much as adults. It's a nice way to personalize the ruins and respite from the sun if it's a hot day!"

Not only are the excavations amazing but the multimedia presentation really makes it easy to seeand understand what we had been seeing for weeks (ruins). We especially enjoyed the film at the end about Trajan's column. We had been admiring it hours before the tour and then to end up learning all about it was a fantastic coincidence.

The connection with Trajan's column is a big surprise, so I won't spoil it. Some effects, such as the shadowy chariot and rider along the old road, filling in the mosaic floor with light effects and making it appear to rain are breathtaking.

It's a strange sensation at first to walk on glass floors above the ruins, but as soon as the first lights illuminate each section, you will immediately be immersed in history.There was also a movie explaining the story told by the carvings on Trajan's column. It had so much information, I wish I could see it again.

No good and the best they could offer was a cross on a poor map so we went off to book directly. After asking directions many times we finally stumbled across Le Domus. The web site and the official brochure do not have a map to the location. Of course it was fully booked but on trying to book in advance, the office couldn't do that or even tell us availability, very poor. They wrote the name of something on a piece of paper. To cut a long story short, after asking in several shops, police, etc, we discovered a small booking office inside a book shop inside a shopping centre ! After 2 hours since we started the exercise, we were told there was no availability for the 3 remaining days of our Rome stay.I hope those running the Domus read this review and make some urgent changes or a good attraction (apparently) will fall by the wayside due to poor management."

The modern city of Rome is built literally on top of the past. The further you dig below the streets, the further back in time you go. The tour is only about 15 people and 1.5 hours long. It is a set tour that has a narrator describe what you are seeing. The narrator is a very clear recorded voice. There is also a guide who directs you from room to room and does hit the button to start the narration until everyone is ready to begin. With the use of lights and some cool effects, you are kept focused on what they are talking about. It is informative, but not overwhelming. The site includes Ancient Rome (of course) and some Renaissance as well.

The digital recreation of what the home might have once looked like were a great addition to the actual excavation. Booking in advance is best but we were able to get a ticket for an afternoon tour when they opened that morning. Definitely worth it. I did not notice whether or not there was an elevator.

I took some pretty tepid steps at first, convinced I would somehow fall through the floor. But you adjust pretty soon, both to the floor and to the dark. The information provided on the tour is really comprehensive, and the actual site is amazing. The light display is cutting edge, or least I think it must be.

Tour is concluded by an up-close look at Trajan's column, a wonder in itself. We have three sons aged 9, 12, and 15, and none of them were bored by this tour. Only caveat is locating it; there is a sign out front, but you have to go well into the Palazzo to get to the ticket office. This site takes Roma passes; tour times all have to be reserved in advance whether you have the Roma pass or not.

For 10 euros, you get an extraordinarily thorough tour of a 1st-3rd century AD Roman Beverly Hills mansion, with on-the-spot re-creations of what you might have been seeing two thousand years ago. It's like a giant now-and-then book with the overlays of what the site originally looked like and what Rome's archaeologists have currently excavated. If you are interested in archaeology and Roman history, this is an authentic place to visit, particularly if you have checked out Trajan's column and ruins first. If you have a choice, don't visit this the day you get off the plane, because large portions of this tour feature semi-darkness and you will think it's time to sleep. Another interesting feature of this site is that it is wheelchair accessible. On our tour, my husband and I were able to watch how they accomodated someone with stairs that turn into a ramp. I am also not sure how many and when their English-speaking tours are, but we got lucky--when we visited at 2pm on a Sunday, they sold us tickets for the 4pm tour, and we were happy to return, after checking out the Pantheon and the Torre Argentina (site of Julius Caesar's death)."

It is really well-done, and it brings the ancient ruins to life in a way that makes them seem very real. I agree with the previous poster who says that it made his visit to Pompeii better - it's really neat to look at the ruins, and then have a picture of what they used to look like.I'll add my 2 cents about booking - you CAN book without buying a ticket, and without paying anything in advance, but I did it by calling them rather than over the internet. Call them at +39 06 32810, and wait for the prompt that gets you to an English-speaking operator. Tell them the date/time that you'd like to visit, and then tell them you're paying with the Roma Pass. They will book your time slot and give you a confirmation number for your reservation. We had already visited several other museums by the time we got to Domus Romane, so we paid the reduced ticket rate at the ticket office when we checked in for our tour.Note that the number above is useful for booking other sites as well; I also reserved a spot at the Borghese Gallery on the same call. Both reservations worked perfectly. I used Skype to call them, for a grand total of about 15 cents! If you book over the internet, you have to pay a surcharge of a few euros per ticket, so definitely call, and use Skype or another VOIP service; you'll save a few euros. As others have said though, booking is essential, because the tour only takes 15 people per visit, and there's only one tour per day in English.Others have mentioned the snack bar - I'll add that their prices are pretty cheap, compared to most tourist stops. An espresso and a bottle of sparkling water cost about 1.40\u20ac. I should have had some food there, too!"

He begged to leave the darkened room, and we just about had him calmed down when \"fire\" struck!! He did manage to make it through, but it was distracting for others.

The tickets say 12.00 and 1.30 which sort of confused us but the English tour is at 1.30. You have to take a tour - you can't go in on your own. Go to the ticket desk and show your internet booking form and they will exchange it for tickets (I was not asked to show ID confirming I was the booker but bought the credit card I used to pay just in case). You will then wait in the courtyard until about 5 minutes before its time to go in. There is a cafe in the courtyard where you can get drinks and food if you arrive a little early. This attraction has a lot of standing so it is worth having a litle sit down before you go in. It takes about and hour from start to finish. The gift shop is in the middle and then you continue with the next part of the tour. Its lovely and cool inside as you are underground so a cardigan is useful. It's a bit difficult to find so worth going early. There is nothing like this in Rome and it was worth every penny. Its just fantastic. I booked through www.ticketone.it and the tickets were 10 Euros each and 1.50 Euros each service fee so 26 Euros for 2 adults.

The script and audio presentation is a bit overwrought in my opinion -- sort of like Disney Meets Discovery Channel -- but that's a fairly small quibble for such an otherwise interesting experience. As noted by others, access is very limited and tickets are often not available via phone or Internet sales until just before the beginning of the month (in our case tickets for June 2012 weren't available until the final week of May 2012) so be sure to check for availability frequently."

I had booked just based on the Trip Advisor reviews because I didn't see it in any of the guide books. I promised that I would write a review because I didn't understand what this would be like based on the reviews before we went. However, I notice that several others have \"filled in the pieces\" of what this attraction is like--pun intended.But I thought I would add my bits and pieces as well....Palazzo Valentini is a government building with some sort of official function. However, at some point excavation of a typical Roman patrician home (or two) (thus the Domus de Romane-Home of a Roman) was done underneath the Palazzo. So a very great presentation of the excavation area was put together for daily tours. If you want the English tour you must take the 1:30 tour. Booking in advance is a good idea but very confusing. Do it if you can. However, if you book in advance they will not accept the Roma Pass.When you enter with a very small group-no more than twenty or so and that was probably 2-4 more than should have been in the group- you will go down a set of stairs to the excavated portion of the building. You walk on a clear plexiglass floor that is over the excavated area for the whole tour. You can see the entire excavation from a very close perspective. In each area you are treated to a media experience not a live tour guide. This is a plus not a negative. You will hear voice over script and see scenes projected on the excavated site that \"fills in the gaps.\" For example, if a partial mosaic was found on the floor the multimedia projection will project what the completed floor will look like. In the swimming pool area, water and decorations are projected. I won't spoil it by giving you all the details. Near the end you will see where a large column was found during the excavation and you will get to see the Trajan column from the perspective of the excavation. This house was really near Trajan Column. Then you will see a film on the story that is carved on Trajan Column...very interesting and well done.I hope this explanation helps and is not a spoiler for those who would rather just be surprised! I would definitely recommend it. It is very interesting and well done. I would also consider doing this tour before the Forum if you could schedule it. It helps you fill the gaps in on all other ruins."

There is a poster outside the main building, but its not that clear when you first enter. We would've given this 5 stars but, when we first arrived, we were told to wait outside in the courtyard. Someone came and checked our tickets, then went back inside. After 5 minutes, we noticed that the other group waiting inside had disappeared. We enquired and were told that that was our group! No one had told us, or the other people who we were waiting outisde with us. Anyway, we caught up with the group and didnt miss much in the end.The experience itself was really interesting. The glass floors and the recontructions via projection were fascinating, state-of-the-art stuff.

It brings to life better than anything I have seen something of what the house must have looked like inside, and as importqant it puts in lots of details about how the conclusions were reached from the archaeological finds, and what must have happened (eg. earthquake, fire etc). It helps you to understand what you are seeing in an outstanding way: you almost forget that you are there and seeing this live as it is as technologically sophisticated as a television programme -- and then the special effects stop for a moment and you can look down and see the reality beneath you. We particularly enjoyed the gradual reconstruction of a mosaic, and the columned room with a girl walking towards you, then going into another room.And the new material on Trajans column is fascinating.... apart from giving the background, it takes you gradually up the column and the story it records (the Dacian wars), stopping to highlight and explain certain amazing scenes, using 3D effects and even colour as on the original. And then at the end you walk still underground a very short distance, look out of a grid door and find yourself just beside the base of the real column itself!This is a high tech site -- all glass, great sound, fabulous visuals! The tour is not totally perfect - not quite enough time to look at the static exhibits of finds in paces, it can get a bit cramped in some places (I think we had 18 on our tour), and folk with an aversion to walking on glass might initially be a bit uneasy (but its totally safe). The visit overall lasted about 1.5 hours. No photography is allowed.There seems to be only the one English tour a day, and booking well ahead is absolutely essential. It is not entirely easy to book, but everything went well after persevering. Unfortunately there is not (yet?) any booklet or even leaflet on the site. But there is a very nice small snack bar right next door (presumably really for staff working in the building over the excavations!).We were left thinking ... IF ONLY more of the sites in Rome had this sort of on-site presentation, but then this is totally underground still (which perversely is an advantage here, as you start in thr dark literally)!, and of course only a few can benefit on each trip.This really is a must-see!"

You walk over a glass floor over the excavations and a light- and multimedia show explains you where the pool was and how the hot water tubes ran. You see a fantastic Roman mosaic that has been partly destroyed by an earthquake and the missing parts are reconstructed by light. The whole visit is done by a voice.over of famous Italian historian Piero Angela. Another strong point is the simple fact that they are open on Mondays, when almost every other museum in Rome (and Europe) is closed."

I decided to call in as I was in the area and was told the English speaking tours were fully booked and that they could not take a booking for the following month when I returned to Rome ...very disappointing for an international tourist... BUT... A quick check of the numbers revealed that they COULD squeeze us in for the next tour.. in an hour! Wonderful service from the girls at the counter.. thank you !After walking the Palantine/Forum/Colosseum etc I had an appreciation for the amazing work the local archaeologists carry out but this experience really brought old Rome to life for me. The sound and light show was extremely well done and the final video on Trajan's Column was a fascinating history lesson in itself. This would be an ideal excursion on a rainy day but one I would recommend any day.The tour numbers are strictly limited and there is a good reason for this so do book ahead if you can... I was lucky but I am sure many others have missed out as word of mouth continues to spread about this state-of-the-art museum"

            "review": "State of theart ancient Roman history. This is probably the most extraordinary high-tech \"history facility\" we have ever visited. As others have said, this Roman villa was destroyed by an earthquake and thereafter buried under a renaissance building and has recently been discovered. You go beneath the Renaissance Palazzo Valentini and are shown by the use of extraordinarily modern visual techniques, the way in which the house was designed and functioned for an extremely important Roman family living close to the centre of ancient Rome. Many of the original rooms and walls exist which makes the experience all the more interesting.The floors are suspended glass and the streets, buildings, walls etc are disclosed to you by clever lighting as well as the use of lasers and wall projections and a continuous commentary. There is also an exhibition of all the artefacts that have been discovered.On our tour, a woman and her mother arrived and seemed to be able to persuade the guides to sell her tickets there and then or at least use non allotted time slots. This was a mistake because it led to our tour being overbooked which means that towards the end of the tour when we were watching a film, three people had to stand for about 30 min and no additional chairs were provided.However, if the organisers limit the number of people to the right number (or increase the number of chairs) then all should be well.The tour is about 90 min The exhibition can only take a limited number of people. I think about approximately 20. You move as a group from room to room as if you were travelling through the house which is underneath and above you as you walk. Therefore, space is limited because it is within an enclosed area. The film towards the end of the tour takes you through the history of ancient Rome as shown onTrajan's Column. TIPS: It is absolutely essential to book and to do so well in advance. It is not suitable for people who cannot go up and down stairs or walk or stand for long periods of time. It is equally fascinating for adults and children. In fact, children will find it really thrilling way of learning about ancient Rome.Eating out: if you want to plan your trip around lunch, we strongly recommend a lovely restaurant nearby called Restorante Abruzzi-Via del Vaccaro good pasta, very reasonable prices with lovely surroundings and good service. See our review of it.This is a \"do not miss attraction\" but you must book early. There do appear to be some glitches on the website and in consequence, whilst it is not much of a comfort do persevere, it's worth it."

Many of Rome's most famous sites are visually inspiring on their own--the aqueducts, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, Michelangelo's dome at St. Peter's, etc.--but to really understand the evolution of Rome over 2,500 years, you have to go beneath the surface, and that is tough, because so much of what you see is decaying walls, broken remnants of pillars, foundations of buildings. It takes some imagination to process these ruins in the context of real people, real life. This exhibit does exactly that in perhaps the coolest application of modern visual technology that I've ever seen. Lasers and light projection \"fill in the blanks\" to show the hallways where the rubble of staircases led, extend the stubs of columns back to their full height and complete the pattern of remnants of mosaic tile floors. My 11-year-old loved it, and so did we. If you plan to go, you really need to book in advance, as most days, they only do one English tour and the group size is limited to maybe a couple dozen people. This might be the best 90-minute investment we made in our recent trip."

The place is somewhat familiar, since it is inside an ancient building of Rome city centre.It is through the excavation made under it that they found what was there since Traian's period.The most amazing thing is the huge column laying down and the mosaics.The virtual reconstraction is something! you have to see it to appreciate the work made by archeologists and computer grafic designers! Available in most of the main languages and cheap! A new thing to see ancient monuments!"

            "review": "Its all true - including italian bureaucracy which is no different to any other bureaucracy. I turned up at the door on a Monday to make a booking at the office . The \"helpful\" provincial police officer standing outside in the snow stopped me from entering the building let alone getting to the booking office. He told me it was closed because of the snow. I told him I only wanted to make a booking. He went into the office and returned saying I had to do that by telephone. So remember to head straight through the entry portal until you reach the open quadrangle. The Domus office is well signed and obvious on the left but you do not see it until you are in the quadrangle.I phoned in my booking that night for 9.30 am the next morning. It is only 4 euros for old people but a 1.50 euro booking fee. The visit however is worth much more in anybody's money.At 9am the next morning I was told to wait. There is, just beside the Domus booking office a really good caffe (probably subsided for the staff) with an upstairs mezzanine where you can drink coffee and eat your cornetto and listen to the chiacchiera while you wait or following your visit. There is also a palatial toilet on the opposite side of the quadrangle to the Domus ( in the provincial office building itself) which you get to through the first imposing doorway you see on the right when you first emerge into the quadrangle. The toilets are down stairs - again to the right. Nice to know if you ever find yourself in a spot in Piazza Venezia! You might have to tell the policeman, if challenged, that you are visiting the domus and have been told the toilet is \"in here.\"At 9.30 in the Domus office I was told I would have to come back at 1pm because they did not have the english guide. In fact the problem was I was the only person who had turned up for the tour and they could not be bothered. Eventually I was assigned a guide whose english was better than my italian but the diorama virtual experience speaks for itself in any language. Other reviewers have covered it well. You do have to watch your footing at first until you get used to the lighting and walking on thick see through glass over open space with the occassional unexpected step or ramp. A bit like skiing in a whiteout. Rome is better in winter than in summer if you have good gear and warm accommodation."

            "review": "Multimedia Museum. Le Domus Romane Di Palazzo Valentini is a good example of how the internet is changing the way we travel and the importance of current informational sites like TA. I checked TA before planning my 4 days in Rome and was very intrigued by this #1 attraction that was unheard of just a few years ago. It\u2019s just across from the Colonna Palace which I had on my itinerary so as instructed by TA reviewers, (and I firmly agree), I booked a reservation on the internet. Their internet site is very easy to navigate and make reservations which are necessary, even when visiting Rome \u201coff season\u201d as I was. The attraction is a multimedia presentation of the archaeological remains of an important Roman house build around 1585. Rooms, mosaics, baths are reconstructed using images projected on the walls/floor/ceiling with explanations given in several languages (pick the language you want when you book your reservation) to give you a better idea of what the house looked like. They also use an large reconstructed model to demonstrate it\u2019s appearance \u201cback in the day\u201d.I enjoyed it but I\u2019m not quite as enthusiastic as most of the other TA reviewers and would not compare it to seeing Pompeii, Herculaneum or Ephesus. They do a very good job with the little actual ruins that they have and I especially enjoyed the reconstruction of the floor mosaic. But for me, the \u201cstar\u201d is the multimedia presentation, not the actual ruins. Because of time constraints, it often felt like we were being herded from room to room by our logistics \u201cguide\u201d and there isn\u2019t enough time to linger over the displays of antique artifacts. Thankfully the number of people is limited, as some rooms are small and at times it was difficult to see the visual reconstruction because of people blocking the view. But overall it\u2019s well done and these are minor complaints. The presentation takes about 1 hour 30 minutes and includes a very interesting reconstruction of Rome, but grab a seat quickly as they didn\u2019t have enough chairs for our group and by then you are ready to sit! Most of the presentation is done in the dark, walking over Plexiglas floors/steps which might be unsettling for some people, but that\u2019s what the logistics \u201cguide\u201d was there for\u2026moving the group through the presentation. No photographs are allowed during the presentation. Overall I give Palazzo Valentini high marks for its innovative, creative multimedia museum and it\u2019s definitely worth seeing, but #1 in Rome\u2026I\u2019m not so sure! Enjoy!"

A little difficult to find... The address is Palazzo Valentini but it is actually at the bottom of the hill Via IV Novembre. The English tour is once a day at 13.15. I would say booking is essential as it is a small tour. I can imagine that in summer you'll have to book well in advance. Bizarrely you cannot pre book at Domus Romane and we were sent to Torre Argentina to the large book shop where there is a booking agent 'booth'. Its only a short walk away and the bonus is that there are ruins there where Caesar was assassinated which is another little advertised thing to see. Yet another bonus for Cat / animal lovers is the cat sanctuary in the ruins which opens at 12.00 till 6.00. www.romancats.com Well worth a visit. Check out www.palazzovalentini.it for details of Domus Romane and telephone numbers / links to sales networks for bookings. Enjoy!!!!!!!"

We were not able to make it to the English tour and opted for the Italian one. Even though my Italian is very limited, I enjoyed it and followed what was being shown. My husband, whose command of Italian is better, compared notes with me afterwards and I really did get most of what was beeing shown. Tour groups are very small and you really get to see a lot.

A very intimate and exciting guided tour to a set of recent excavations beneath the Palazzo Valentini, whose day job is to be the home of the regional government. Perhaps that explains something of the surely prodigious funding which has been applied to present and render immediately comprehensible a series of excavations. What may not be apparent from the website or the ticket agency is how small a group you are in - I counted 15 on a day during which the notices said all tours were sold out. If there is someone in your family who is studying Latin or Ancient History, this should be the first thing you book."

We are unashamed lovers of Roman historical sites and quite capable of spending hours picking round the ruins but this place should be on everyone's must see list for Rome.

These special effects make the ruins completely understandable and enjoyable by everyone of all ages. Quite beautiful and fascinating - we were thrilled by the visit.

The English - speaking tour of 15 people is now once a day at 1:15 and it sells out fast, we were told.

So we went back Wednesday when it opened and reserved tickets for that afternoon English tour at 1:30. It is in a government building, so there is security. Ask for the Domus Romane and they will point the way. Walking on a glass floor takes a little getting used to, but once the media show begins to tell the story, you forget about walking on glass ! It was a great presentation and made the ruins really come to life. We highly recommend it. PS Students under 25 got a 2 euro discount"

Hiding under the rennaissance Palazzo Valentini (today hosting the Government of the Province of Rome) this magnificent Roman Villa was discovered. The reconstruction not only reminds us of the advanced plumbing and heating techniques but also thanks to a mixed media show it gives us a feel for the internal decoration frescoes and mosaics. As a bonus, there are moments when rennaisance and antiquity pile up on top of each other giving insights into both.Very well presented tour.
