Its tiny in comparison to its more famous compatriots but that adds to its charm, as you can get up close to the tiles and see the individual brush strokes on each hand-painted masterpiece. This mosque is a little hard to find, in the alleys behind the Spice Bazaar, but ask around and make the effort to visit. You won't regret it"

One of the most impressive and beautiful collections of Ottoman Turkish Iznik tiles anywhere. This is a must-visit mosque if you are in Istanbul. The interior is covered wall-to-wall with the most amazing Iznik tiles, consequently if you stand in the middle of the mosque which is bathed with light coming from all four directions, you will get a taste of how it feels to walk through a painting! The entrance can be a bit tricky to find. The mosque sits above shops, as it has been since the Ottoman times, you will need to go up a flight of steps between the shops from which will get you get the mosque courtyard which then leads to the mosque entrance door. Have fun!!"

I found it to be more peaceful and more beautiful, and certainly less crowded, than the Blue Mosque. It took a bit of doing to find it, but at Rustem Pasa, we were two of about 10 people inside in the afternoon. That includes tourists and people praying. It was wonderful! Not being familiar with mosques, at Rustem Pasa we could really enjoy its beauty and even feel comfortable relaxing to meditate for a bit, which is always welcome in the hustle and bustle of city sightseeing. Here you can get up close to the tile work, see its beauty and the intense color. Definitely worth a visit. Also be sure to support the vendor outside, he was selling postcards and other great yet inexpensive souvenirs. Have a good look at the outside of the mosque, too, great tiles there as well."

It has many variations of decorative tiles and is completely accessible. No barriers and fewer people than the Blue Mosque. It is truly a peaceful oasis for reflection and appreciation of this unique architecture. Tip: Shoes off before entering and head scarves for the women."

There is a bench to sit on to take off your shoes, a cubby to store you shoes, scarves to cover your head if you don't have one and a rack with free Qurans in a variety of languages! But all of that is secondary to the inside of the mosque; every inch is covered with Itzak blue ties. Every inch! And the lamps are low so that anyone who wants to sit on the rugs and read and pray can see what they are reading. There is a section that is roped off that is for prayer, and the casual visitor would do well to respect that, but the mosque is completely available to wander through, to take pictures, to touch the tiles. It is intimate. An amazing experience."

He was married to the Sultan\u2019s favorite and only daughter, Mihrimah. Rustem Pasha mosque is in the straw-mat weavers\u2019 market and adjacent to the Spice Market. The mosque was designed by the famous Ottoman imperial architect, Mimar Sinan, who also designed Suleiman\u2019s own mosque, and the mosques of the sultan\u2019s first son Shezad and daughter Mihrimah.Smaller in size than most others yet very beautiful and charming on the inside with blue iznic tiled walls. Most remarkably it had just a few worshipers and one could move around freely. This mosque is striking in its contrast to the grand Suleymaniye mosque a short distance from it. A little further from the Suleymaniye mosque is the Shezadi mosque. We visited all three mosques in one afternoon within a span of four hours including walking time."

The Rustem Pasa mosque, in particular, is rather unique since it is built above ground level from where you can look down at the crowed little alleys of the market.

It is set in a very urban area in the vicinity of the spice market and I felt lucky to have found it...keep looking! The collection of classic Iznik ceramic tiles are simply unsurpassed and it is so amazingly well preserved. Do not miss it!"

When examined by the court doctors it was discovered he had nothing more contagious than an infestation of lice. His subsequent marriage to the princess gave him privileged power and he amassed a huge fortune, which gave rise to the nickname \"Kehle-i-\u0130kbal\", the\"Louse of Fortune\". The mosque is considered to have been built by Mimar Sinan in 1561 but it was damaged by fire in 1660. The dome, mounted on eight pillars, collapsed during an earthquake in 1766. Both the exterior and interior were altered during renovations in the 18thC. A measure of R\u00fcstem Pa\u015fa's wealth can be seen by the amazing display of \u0130znik tiles which cover most of the mosques interior. The faience of the \u0130znik craftsmen was at its zenith and the panels include a dazzling assortment of geometric designs and bold, vivid floral patterns using various pigments, including \"Armenian Bole\". A panel on the left hand side of the entrance gate is the finest abstract example of 16thC art with the tiles being placed asymmetrically . "

The tiles, which cover all walls, the dome, and the intricate galleries, are equally stunning when viewed in aggregate, taking in the space, or close-up, in detail. The Islamic proscription of images of human or animal forms results in what I felt to be a rather severe aesthetic restricted to symbols and mildly abstracted plants and flowers.

This mosque, designed by the great Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, was built for him in 1561.The mosque is in the middle of the market area just beyond Eminonu square. The mosque has a dome and a single minaret.The interior of the mosque is covered in hundreds of Iznik tiles (mainly in blue coloured patterns). We were told that each tile is unique, even if just slightly different from the others."

You can spend about 30 minutes just looking at the domes. Then you can move to the tiles work which is called Iznik tiles which you may buy later at Arasta bazaar. Before you leave don\u2019t forget to admire the colored wood works by the windows. Time has treated this mosque rough but it still deserves a very detailed visit.

Rustem pasha mosque is one of the most beautiful mosques in Istanbul in the area of Grand Bazaar. It is located about 200 yards far away from Spice market in Emin\u00f6n\u00fc Square today. It is really worth visiting to see beautiful tiles and wall decorations of interior part of the mosque."

Ask for directions, and when you get close, look for a stairway up to the mosque. The tiles in this tiny mosque are spectacular, and make it worth going out of your way to visit. Unlike the more \"touristed\" mosques, this one doesn't have barriers set up to keep tourists away from parts of the mosque. Keep in mind that if you arrive and someone is praying you should speak softly to avoid disturbing their prayers and avoid walking in front of them while they are praying. You will be asked to leave during formal prayer times, but at other times you are welcome to visit as long as you remove your shoes and dress appropriately. This is one of my favorite small mosques in Istanbul because it is so beautiful and the light coming in at different times of day creates a myriad of peaceful shifting highlights and shadows. Do yourself a favor and visit when you are near the Spice Bazaar/NewMosque/ Galata Bridge area."

Some of the modern forniture (book cases, shoe rack) is really horrible, but the atmosphere is authentic and the complex is clean and surprisingly not crowded with tourists (it's really close to the New Mosque and the spice bazaar in Eminonu)."

It was hard to find as it is situated up stone steps near the Egyptian (Spice) market. It was closed to visitors having sustained damage in the Quake with a few cracked walls. The caretaker came and let us in as he knew the effort we had made to find it. After removing shoes and donning suitable attire we had a good look around. I was so pleased on this trip to find it had been restored. The tiles inside are just beautiful and because it is small it has a special ambiance. The original caretaker has passed on but I was pleased to learn he saw his beloved Mosque restored. This is not a \"Great\" building but has it's own beauty and calm and well worth the search."

However Rustem Pasha is really nicer in many ways than any other mosque. First is it off the beaten track so it is NOT filled with heaps of tourist and tour groups. It is small, quiet and quaint. The big attraction are the stunning blue tiles both inside and outside the mosque. While the blue mosque also has nice tiles the sheer size of the place makes it harder to appreciate them. At Rustem Pasha you can appreciate the tiles close up and without the pressing tourist throngs all around you. It is near the Spice Market at Eminonu. If you are facing the water at the bridge just walk to the left about 7 minutes and it is the first mosque you come to along the water edge. This was my favorite mosque we visited in 3 weeks in Turkey. Don't miss it."

After all the Mosques you'll get to see in Istanbul - the Blue Mosque, the Suleyemaniye Mosque, New Mosque and others it might seem a little strange to wend your way to this far smaller place of worship.So why do so many people do it (apart from the fact that it is featured in such works as the Lonely Planet Pocket Guide to Istanbul which describes it as a 'gem')?Well mainly because it has some very pleasing tile work. And because it is on a more human scale. It is truly a different feeling to be in a mosque that doesn't see thousands of visitors every day. There will be locals around, the entrance is up a somewhat dank staircase, the whole place isn't festooned with annoying carpet salesmen (double bonus!) and all told it is a far quirkier vibe to visit this place than some of the other big name attractions.If you are in the Eminonu area to see, for example, New Mosque and the Spice Bazar or plan to walk over the Galata Bridge to see the tower of the same name then if you have the time to spare to find this place it will give you a different experience to the other Mosques.Recommended for its difference as opposed to its grandeur."

Set just above and behind the spice market, it was built by a wealthy man many, many years ago and has only one minaret as he didn't want to upstage the Sultan and his newly built Suleymaniye mosque. The interior is decorated with 16 century Izmir tiles. I had a very special interaction with a Moslem lady here, who saw us westerners (my daughter and I ) taking our shoes off and donning our scarves, and who volunteered to explain the mosque's interior features to us. We then held hands - women across different cultures, coming together for a moment of quiet communion, thinking thoughts of peace. Wonderful."

It's beautiful when looking at the whole interior, when looking at specific features, all the way down to individual tiles. You can enjoy it peace, too, as only a handful of tourists are there at any time. Make sure you see it when the sun is shining.Unlike other Istanbul mosques high on the priority list, this one is not only small, but tricky to locate. Walk west on the main passageway through the Spice Market, and about 200 meters further on the right, look for a simple doorway leading to stairs to the second floor. If you go to the Spice Market, the New Mosque or the Galata Bridge, make sure you walk a little further to Rustem Pasha."

The mosque was commissioned by Suleyman\u2019s Grand Vizier and son-in-law Rustem Pasa and was built in 1561. No entry fee is required. The fa\u00e7ade of the mosque was covered with lovely Iznik tiles, but were in many places cracked and needing repair/restoration. The interior was amazing \u2013 covered from top to bottom with dazzling Iznik tiles with floral designs and patterns. There were just two other people when we were there, so it was very quiet - it seems this is a mosque for locals not tourists.

To get here from the shopping streets you have to go into small little dark stair cases that say \"Rustem Pasha Cami\". There are several entrances and you can't really see where they go, but they do go up above the street level and into the light! The mosque is really lovely - I like the ones with all the decoration and so I give this a 5 because of all the tile and painting. It is not as large as Suleyman or as scenic, but more intimate. Since there were hardly any people inside, it felt quite personal. There was an interesting piece of black and white motif above the entrance door (on the inside). Sort of like a maze. I asked the man in attendance and he looked through some books, but did not find a picture. or it's meaning. He guessed it said Allah forwards and backwards (why not?), and I was grateful for his effort. I would definitely go back."

We were in Istanbul for 5 days and could see this mosque in the distance, but when you are closer it is difficult to find. I had read that it was on the first floor and there are commercial businesses on the ground floor, so I kept digging around the market (it is just next to the Spice Bazaar or Egyptian Market) and the shops for a sign. I could not find anything in the hustle & bustle. We came across a staircase leading up through an open doorway and thought we would follow it. Up through the ancient stone stairwell it opens to the mosque and surrounds. It is quiet, even in the open areas around the mosque, the cacophony that is constantly with you in Istanbul, is dulled down and is a quiet soundtrack in the background. There is no one around, except for the curator who offeres you head scarves and shows you where to store your shoes.The inside is exquisite, the colours are bright and vibrant (has recently been restored). Inside it is so quiet. There is only 5 other people inside the mosque, with us being the only tourists. I loved the smaller size of this mosque, although it is no less impressive than the Blue mosque. Visit here, it is well worth the trouble of finding the stairs, and you don't feel pressured or rushed as you take in the beauty of the carpets, chandeliers, carvings, windows, and other fittings inside. A quiet and respectful place for reflection, where you are made to feel welcomed. My favourite mosque in Istanbul."

The design of the mosque by the famed architect, Mimar Sinan is truly inspiring in its modesty and simplicity. Unlike any other mosque, it is perched on top of a neighbourhood and one has to take the staircase to reach the entrance. As it is hidden among the maze of bazaar and can be quite tricky to get here, just take note that it is located directly opposite the Eminonu bus station. There is a public restroom connected to the building of the mosque. Walk along the wall that connects to the restroom and you can spot a discreet entrance with a sign indicating the name of the mosque. Given the fact that it was designed by an acclaimed architect, you have to drop by for a visit to be awed and to be inspired!"

To get back at him the builder decided to create a very small, average mosque. When the man saw it he was less than please and his ego bruised. He told the builder that if he valued his life he better make this small mosque among the most beautiful. He did and then some. Rustem Pasha is a little hard to find (especially the entrance) but is worth the effort. It's like,the Blue Mosque in miniature, and the intensity of color is enhanced because do its small size. The delicate tiles are placed in intricate patterns throughout, and because it doesn't attract the huge throngs of visitors, in addition to being a place of worship, it's also a place of quiet reflection where visitors can marvel at its sheer beauty. If women aren't adequately covered they have a supply of fabrics that can double as skirts to cover knees or head scarves. Directly outside the exit there is an attendant who sells books and some small lovely trinkets."

Much smaller (but older) than the Blue Mosque, I visited at around 5pm and I was the only person there with my guide. Inside the quiet interior, it was hard to believe just outside there were crowds of people rushing too and from the Spice Market. After the crowds of the Blue Mosque, I appreciated being able to get up close to the hand painted \u0130znik tiles. A very beautiful place to visit."

Should women not be properly attired, they will provide you with a headscarf for your head and a robe to cover your shoulders and legs. Once inside it is full of beautiful blue tiles all over the walls and stained glass windows.

While the Blue Mosque and Sulemanye Mosque are designed to awe with their massive size and decorative programs, the Rustem Pasha Mosque feels like a discovery, off the beaten path but in plain sight. We read about it having the best preserved and most beautiful program of Iznik tile decoration. I think this is what I imagined the Blue Mosque would look like. It's gleaming, glistening tiles everyone in a riot of patterns, all in shades of blue. It's so quiet and intimate, but still awesome in its spiritual power. I did my prayers here in the women's section (which, like all women's sections is cordoned off with a wooden gate). I'm not the biggest fan of this technique (which is due to the need to segregate the sexes, but results in women getting the short side of the stick when it comes to appreciating the beauty of the space), but for whatever reason, I enjoyed the feeling of separation from everyone, from reality. This was probably my most transcendent experience in Istanbul, and I would highly recommend taking the opportunity to duck in, even for a few minutes. It's sublime."

It is located above shops in the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc area very close to the Spice Market. (When it was built the revenue from the shops helped towards the costs for maintaining the mosque)There are 4 gates which lead up to the mosque - 3 of them are on Uzun Carsi St. If you can't find them just ask a local and they are usually more than happy to help you. To access the mosque you must go through this gate/doorway up a small set of stairs which then open out to the courtyard. Here you will see the facade of the mosque which has several large Iznik tile panels. You can enter the mosque on the left hand side and when you enter, just take your time. The reason why this mosque is the most beautiful mosque in Istanbul is that it is decorated wall to wall in Iznik tiles which creates almost a blue garden of designs. Not only are the tiles amazing but when you look at each of the panels you will see many different designs. These tiles were created during the time when the best quality tiles were being created and so they are superior to the tiles that you will see in other locations such as the Topkapi Palace and Blue Mosque. The tiles not only have the blue colour but they have the lesser used coral colour which had just started to be used when these tiles were created. The mosque is smaller than others in Istanbul but it has a charm to it which I did not find at other grander mosques.The R\u00fcstem Mosque is not widely visited by large tour groups. I spent a large amount of time here for a professional photography shoot and during this time (over half a day) there would have been 3 groups of approximately 15 people each come through. The staff who work here are also very friendly and helpful. Take some time out just to sit in the courtyard and enjoy the atmosphere away from the busy street below. Most people will only spend 1/2 hour here but you could spend longer just looking at the different types of tiles. I was able to view the interior with the lights off and with them on, when the lights are on, it just lights up the whole inside of the mosque which is amazing.If you only have time to visit a couple of mosques in Istanbul this for me would be one I would never hesitate to recommend being on your list."

The tile work features various designs as usual but here, they complement each other beautifully. You feel the architect's loving attention in every little detail. Frankly, I don't know if it can get better than this. I certainly didn't see I.Tip: if you see this and then visit the Blue Mosque, you will be stunned at how messy and garish the Blue Mosque feels.

It is a superb example of Ottoman Turkish architecture, creation of the great Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, building a mosque to an octagonal plan. It was built on the former site of Hac\u0131 Halil Mescid with a size measuring only 40 by 40 meters square. The short staircases leading up to the mosque are concealed. Ascending to the open courtyard of the mosque, it feels like stepping into a different world. Sinan seemed to have brought the idea of the garden inside his creation through applied decoration. The marriage of exquisite Iznik faience (colored tiles) and architecture designed to showcase them, is wonderfully harmonious in this Mosque. The tiles, made at the height of Iznik's supremacy, have a good deal of the famous red color that was the envy of other tilemakers (blue, yellow, white and green were easy colors to produce, but red was extraordinarily difficult.) Take note of the k\u00fcndek\u00e2ri doors of carved and inlaid wood, and the intricate gilded trim (kalemisi) high on the walls and ceiling in the vestibule. The flowers ornamenting in the tiles of this mosque can be seen in the curling leaves and cloud-bands that characterize the \u201cSaz Style.\u201d Thickets of naturalistic flowering branches complement arrangements of clearly recognizable flora in the Imperial \u201cFour Flowers Style,\u201d which celebrates the rose, tulip, hyacinth and carnation. Rather than be measured in size and grandeur (as compared to the bigger and more famous mosques in Istanbul), the R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque is an architectural gem with exquisite artistic refinement and for those who like architecture and art, this is a must see."

The mosque also had postcards of the tile work for sale and I picked up a free Quran, something I think is a wonderful gift to have available for visitors who wish to understand Islam better. Like all mosques, be sure to take your shoes off in the appropriate place and make sure women's heads are covered with a hood or scarf."

It also has its own character and face. I got used to go there alone or with my friends just to have a little break in the middle of the intensive Istanbul life. Usually, I come to Eminonu by tram from Sultanahmet, where I live. Then I just walk about two hundred metres or so by a spacious open square, turn the corner and practically plunge into the old good times of history...I go up the stone stairs and after leaving my shoes outside of the entrance, get in the mosque. I spend some time there in a quiet and peaceful atmosphere, looking around, examining the beauty of its interior. Even I was there for already a dozen of times, I am always impressed by the magic of its blue colours! I admire the Iznik tyles, used in the decoration of the interior and the part of the exterior of this mosque. I see many copies in the city, sold as the souveniers, like the magnets for the refrigerators and I always recognise the pictures, taken from that little mosque, which is not so well known by the ordinary tourists, spending most of their time in Sultanahmet or Istiklal...If you are looking for something special, please take your time and come along here to see the beauty, hidden from the crowds..."

Entrance to the mosque is from both ends through narrow winding stairs that leads to the courtyard where there are about 5 domes supported by columns.The mosque is famous for its exquisite iznik tiles inside and out.

It was the first mosque we saw in our trip, but I can tell you that even before seeing the Blue Mosque, it was a truly surprise because of its walls decoration on Iznic tiles, all in different scales of blue. That\u00b4s what make this tiny mosque special and different form the others. There are not too much tourists in this attraction, so it\u00b4s very relaxed to come into it.

I had to ask instructions and point at a map. It is close to the main road along the edge of the Golden Horn waterway, at the bottom of a road called Makheme Sk on the northern fringe of the bazaar area, immediately off the western corner of the large open square opposite the south end of the Galata bridge. In this narrow enclosed street, facing the direction of the water (you can't see it), there is an arch in the wall to your right and a small sign announcing Rustem Pasa Camii. Go up these stairs.If it is lunch time when you leave, return to the street, turn left, and a few metres along on the right you will find a lady making g\u00f6zleme on an iron dome (like an inverted plough share), the pancake-like thin pizzas from Turkey - an ideal light snack.

So finding it can take a bit of searching, but it really is worth it. The interior has a stillness, beauty & calm that offers respite from the clamour of the markets outside its walls. A man sat in quiet contemplation & I felt a bit guilty watching him pray yet interested at the same time. It was the cosiest and possibly the most lavish mosque I saw in Istanbul."

Although not as large as some of the mosques in this incredible city, this one is arguably the most beautiful. It is much bluer than the Blue mosque because the walls and columns are covered with amazing Iznik blue tiles of a great variety of designs. The overall effect is really moving. The detailed designs are a pure delight and one can spend a long time just exploring them. The architect Sinan, who built so much in 16th century Istanbul has surely created one of the world's masterpieces. For a memory of your visit, the excellent book available outside the mosque 'Rustem Pasha Mosque and Iznik Tiles' is strongly recommended."
