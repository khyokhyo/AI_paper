The campus is beautifully landscaped. The exteriors and interiors of the buildings were beautiful. Because 2 of us are nurses, seeing the operating room with its two story double glazed windows was breathtaking. We walked ourselves through the site, without joining the guided tours. The guided tours are offered on different days for different languages."

The foundation is in the process of restoring them. Visible inside are the main pavilion (noteworthy), the triage area (where they kept the patients as soon as they arrived) and one ward. Aside from the main pavilion, meant to impress visitors of the time, most of the beauty is in the exterior of the building and in how they relate to each other."

Unfortunately, buildings are empty or closed, so you can enjoy only the architecture and some interiors, but their beauty makes the visit totally worth it. Despite we can only imagine how it looked when the hospital was there (several photos are also available), I sincerely hope that in the future a medicine museum will be arranged in this space."

We waited until the end of our trip to visit (stayed in Barcelona before and after cruise) and it was a great way to spend a lazy afternoon. We ate a late lunch first in the caf\u00e9 that is in the front courtyard (really good food) - and paid the 10 euro (kids were free!) - we all wandered around in slightly different directions - the buildings are absolutely gorgeous - only a couple are open with info about what the hospital was like - the main building and the tunnels were my favorite. There are a couple of buildings that some charity organizations are using (i.e. a branch of the World Health Organization).....the flowers and greenery are lush and so well taken care of. Everyone enjoyed the visit - but the two of us that are healthcare workers were especially fascinated.....there were only a few other people touring at the same time which was a really nice change of pace!"

The size of the old hospital is staggering, although only a few of the buildings are open to visit. The exteriors have undergone a complete restoration and work is now ongoing in some of the pavilion interiors. Although visitors can tour the site independently, we joined a guided tour and felt the small extra charge for this was well worth it. Our guide was very informative and we felt we gained a much better appreciation of the history than we otherwise would have. I'm sure before long this will be up there with Gaudi's masterpieces as a must see attraction in Barcelona."

Don't be confused there is a modern hospital near it. This used to be an old hospital. I can't get over the buildings. I would not have minded staying here. I would love to see it being better utilized. Such character. Barcelona is filled with such beautiful architecture. It is not crowded compared to some of the other places at all. We walked to Sagrada Familia and rode the train back from there. Visited August 2015"

Unlike a lot of tourist traps in BCN this is a peaceful, laid-back place to visit with simply incredible architecture set in beautiful grounds. For an unguided tour, entry is 10 euro and includes a small but useful guidebook. The complex is immaculate, almost as if it was brand new, but it's steeped in history. The visit takes you through part of the tunnel complex, into the operating theatre, into one of the infirmaries and finally the administrative building - it's a shame more of the buildings weren't accessible, but the ones that were open were a good mix, and I suspect with so much symmetry in the design of the complex it would have only have been more of the same.The buildings are beautiful, and although a cursory visit could probably last an hour, I got lost with the detail and was there for several hours taking pictures of masonry, mosaics, statues, domed tiled roofs and spectacular interior details.Although I can't take anything away from the Gaudi masterpieces in Barcelona, San Pau offers a complete change of pace and is absolutely stunning, particularly for 10 euros."

Beautiful architecture with a rich history, including how medicine was practised in the past, makes this an eye-opening tour. The area however is rather small and you can probably finish the tour within a hour, because many buildings are still in use by organisations (e.g. WHO) and out-of-bounds to visitors. Lines are usually short so you can get your tickets on the spot, unless it's a weekend or holiday then it will be faster online."

Coming through the beautiful entrance of Sant Pau, I certainly wasn't prepared for what was in front of me! It was not one or two beautiful buildings, but a dozen of stunningly beautiful art nuveau buildings, which formed something like the oasis in the heart of the city. One can almost feel like in a fairytale, walking through the peaceful gardens from one building to the other. Standing there in the mid of that beauty, one cannot even imagine that this was a hospital once. That must have been the most beautiful one in the world! And most importantly - there weren't any queues, not even many visitors (it was around noon, working day), so I highly recommend this visit to everyone who loves art and architecture, and would like to spend some quiet quality time in a crowded city like Barcelona is."

We have been to other Domenech y Montaner sites in Barca in past years, notably the wonderful Palau Musica Catalana, and the Casa Lleo Morena, and this seemed like a great place to visit - we were not disappointed. A large hospital site, where you area allowed access to four buildings - the central administration block, the operating theatre building (recently opened), one of the ward buildings, and an admissions pavilion that serves as a temporary exhibition hall. All, especially the Admin block, are Modernista jewels.We took an English Language guided tour - a little extra but well worth the money, as the guide gave a lot of insights into the history of the building - the benefactor who started it, how the different wards were used (including the underground tunnels), how it is being renovated since becoming a UNESCO heritage site, and how the different pavilions are used now and how it links to the new (2009) hospital built behind. After the tour, you are free to walk around some more. Easy to get to on the metro (Sant Pau is one stop after Sagrada Familia). We ate at the 1902 Cafe for lunch - nice but rather pricey. All in all - well worth seeing a whole Modernista complex, one can only admire both the vision and the attention to detail in the interiors. I feel that the Gaudi buildings get all the footfall (and deservedly), but the Domench y Montaner buildings are equally fabulous."

It has about a dozen modernist-style buildings, all very beautiful inside and out, in a park-like setting, designed with the idea that patients would heal better if they were surround by architectural and natural beauty. What a great concept! The Recinte has been open for, I think, only about 5 years or so, and they are still doing much restoration to the buildings, so only a few are open, which is a shame, but it's well worth the trip. There is a subway station just two blocks away (one stop up from Sagrada Familia on the blue line), so even though it's not near the city center, it's very easy to get to."

I love mosaic art and colored ceramic roof tiles, so I was surprised when this visit left me feeling blah. Yes, this old hospital does have a nicely planned campus of a dozen beautiful Art Nouveau buildings, but only four are accessible and only one (the main administration building) has a noteworthy interior; the other three are rundown or bland. So you're really just looking at the outside of a cluster of buildings for a 10 Euro fee (add 6 Euro more if you opt for the guided tour which I'm glad I skipped). It's not that the quick visit isn't worthwhile , it's just limited and overpriced."

Yet another place that used to be free and not anymore, Sant Pau Hospital is an amazing example of modernist architecture, and since it's a big complex, it's even more interesting. However, the museum has added the entrance fee without adding any reasonable content.Out of some 8-10 buildings of the museum, only 3 are open for the visitors; only half of the main hall is open, while some more interesting parts of it are used for something else. The remaining two buildings are practically empty from the inside and totally fail to show how the place operated as a hospital - which would be the most interesting part. The only excuse that might be, is if they currently work on the restoration of the remaining buildings, which I'm not sure is the case. On the end of the day - an architectural masterpiece turned into a very weak museum.A big \"WOW\" to Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, a big thumbs down to the organizers of the museum, who seemingly couldn't bother less, other that collecting money."

We'd walked up from La Sagrada Familia, which of course, is a wonder, but also swarming with tourists. By contast, Hospital Sant Pau was almost deserted: a real oasis of calm which felt right considering the original purpose of the buildings. Importantly this is a living 'monument\" (sorry, can't think of a better word) as it still houses conferences, meetings and medical research facilities.The history of each building is well explained pictorially and textually. The scale of the renovations is impressive, and to see the original photographs of the hospital inmates was beyond touching. Our only very small criticism was that the exhibition of the renovations lacked a mapIt seems that Hospital Sant Pau is a greatly underestimated and overlooked aspect of Barcelona's rich cultural history, but selfishly the lack of crowds added to our enjoyment."

We've visited many modernist sites across the city and this was the first time we've been able to come here since it opened to visitors. We purchased the ruta del modernisme book, and it's possible to get an accompanying voucher book, so we had a reduced price entry here.There was a private event on at the same time, which didn't interfere too much with our visit, except we had to exit from a different door. The buildings and gardens you can access are absolutely amazing. Don't hesitate about visiting, just go.The only negative experience was when I went to head out the main door at the end of our visit and a female security guard stepped in my way, vigorously waved her finger in my face and pointed to one of the visitor attendants who spoke english. I responded to the guard in Spanish, asking if I could help her and why she didn't just ask me to go the other way rather than the pointing, I speak Spanish. She shrugged and said \"well I didn't know that\". I work in a museum and if our guards had her attitude they'd be spoken to. Maybe a little less assumption on their part would be good. Overall some of the staff were the only things to let the visit down. Basics like greeting visitors with a smile when they enter a gallery, avoiding glaring at people, etc were missing and the staff lacked consistency. On the other hand, the reception ticket sales desk were helpful and friendly, as was the final visitor attendant wee saw. A bit of visitor training would be advantageous to their team.If you visit, make sure to have a glass of cava in the bar across from the entrance. It was great to sit outside next to the warm heaters and have a cold drink in December!"

Just a 5-6 block walk from Sagrada Familia, this amazing complex of Modernisme buildings might as well be in the countryside, for how little-visited it is. At least on my late-October visit, after leaving Sagrada Familia (with easily one or two thousand people milling around) the Hospital Sant Pau complex had perhaps 100 people visiting it. A complex of several buildings, all connected by underground tunnels and ground-level paths, it was a working hospital complex for many years (and the site of some form of hospital, since the Middle Ages.) A few of the 8 or 9 buildings are open currently -- the massive Administrative Building, with its astonishing grand staircase and impressive vaulted main room on the second floor, and then 3 other buildings behind it -- which were originally various wards of the hospital, such as Trauma, Obstetrics, etc. The smaller buildings are beautiful in their Modernisme style, with domes, towers and turrets, gargoyles, colorful tile, beautiful sculptural pieces, etc. Ornamentation everywhere, and just a delight to look at! The entire complex is closed off from the city around it -- you must go through the Admission desk to enter the complex, and once you do, it is practically an urban park; peaceful, spacious, and again on my visit, very nearly empty. After the crowds at Sagrada (which of course was amazing to see) and a quick tapas lunch, this was a wonderful, peaceful break for the afternoon. Highly recommended!"

The external architecture is stunning but there were so few places you were allowed to enter and rude staff telling us where we could not go, yet it isn't that clear if places are out of bounds. Security getting in is like going rough the airport security in you go through scanners, have to empty contents of handbags in some cases and all bags go through security scanners too and staff and not friendly! A cleaner told us off for entering a room which was suppose to be open to the public until 6:30pm but she was cleaning for end of day at 4:30pm! A security guard said you can not go upstairs but our guidebook said we could! The only buildings open besides part of main building was the toilet block, and two old hospital wards, one with curtains still in situe but nothing else in room, and another with photographs from Japan which had nothing to do with the place! We wanted to take photos at the front of main building but a model was having photos taken and the area was restricted so in all there was very little to look at and its expensive to get in to see nothing!"

We were expecting an operational hospital not what we found but boy were we happy she sent us there. This is little known and has recently been opened after some restoration work. The former hospital is about 1K from Sagrada Familia and you can see the Basilica from the upstairs of the Administration building. Entry is 8 euros, less if a senior, and once inside you will find a city within the city. There are 8 buildings in the complex, all decorated with amazing external artwork. There are 3 buildings that you can enter including the administration building, don't miss the view from upstairs in both directions from that one.The whole complex with male and female sections, tunnels to access them, the beautiful gardens and the magnificent architecture is not to be missed. We spent over 3 hours there and I took approx. 200 photos."

The outside is fabulous but be sure and buy the 8 euro ticket to enter the complex. There are no lines at all. The are beautiful gardens inside and a complex of buildings, 3 of which you can enter. The administration building is not to be missed. It is still being restored but should be better promoted -we almost missed going there."

We made it in plenty of time and were even able to duck in a cafeteria for a snack on the way. This is the site of an old hospital and was designed by Montraner (same as the Palau de la Musica). In this case I would recommend the guided tour -there were only four of us, it took less than an hour, and the guide took us to a couple of rooms that were roped off from visitors. The ceilings here are amazing. I would highly recommend the visit and it's easy to couple with a visit to the Sagrada Familia.

This beautiful complex, is captivating in how the architect combined beauty with function to help the sick. Starting as a small hospital the former Hospital de la Santa Creu located in the Raval neighborhood needed to be relocated, as it became too small for Barcelona's developing and growing population....So, architect Lluis Dom\u00e8nech built this hospital on his belief that our surroundings and beautiful environment, such as trees, flowers and fresh air were more likely to have a positive impact, and effect by helping people recover from illness more than anything doctors could do in a sterile, functional environment on their own. So he combined beauty, nature with hospital technology and Barcelona ended up with a hospital that was simply magnificent. The sculptures and mosaics, make the buildings even more interesting. The hospital had always been associated with new discoveries in medicine, charities, all things positive. So, in 1978, the Modernista was listed as a Historic Artistic Monument, and in 1997 it became a UNESCO World Heritage site. The building began somewhere around 1905, and finished in 1930. The former hospital complex is now a knowledge campus and the headquarters of several international organizations. What I didn't know until I took the tour, and read up on him is that Dom\u00e8nech joined the School of Architecture first as a lecturer, and later became its director in 1900. During his time there he trained students such as Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and the incredible Antoni Gaud\u00ed. Ahh, so Gaudi learned and incorporated some magnificent architecture from Dom\u00e8nech, so it is great that the master, even though his modernist architecture is not off the wall, or unique in the same way as some of Gaudi's works, it is incredibly beautiful and magnificent and needed to be celebrated. Put this on your bucket or to see list when in Barcelona."

The architect was Gaudi's teacher and Gaudi makes more sense if you have seen how he grew from this less crazy but still ornamental style.

We learnt a great deal about the benefactor Pau Gil, and the clever design by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner including underground transportation tunnels that connect all 14 recuperation pavilions, beautiful tiles in the dormitories, and sun rooms for the patients.

It was so easy to walk between the two, a straight road that runs diagonally, so very difficult to get lost. We arrived in time for the 1pm English tour and so opted for that rather than a self-guided tour as we knew nothing about the site. The tour had approx. 15 people on it and this meant we also got to visit places in the main building that would have otherwise been unavailable to us. Entry wasn\u2019t cheap but was most definitely worth it; our guide was very knowledgeable and you were given a fairly substantial guide that covered the history of the site. The architecture looked pretty forward thinking for us in 2015, so I can\u2019t imagine what the Barcelona people thought when it was first built. Some of the photos we took here were amazing. The colours are incredible - the yellow tiles on the roof, green tiled walls and pink ceilings inside the buildings. The main thing I noticed (particularly after La Sagrada Familia) was the lack of crowds. You could easily take photos of the site with no one else in shot. It really didn\u2019t feel like you were in the centre of a main city, a little bubble of calm. The site was the best thing we did in Barcelona and I highly recommend!"

The complex was originally built as a hospital and opened in 1930 as the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Satnt Pau. After extensive renovations the site was reopened as a museum in February 2014. There are now twelve pavilions left of the original \"City within a City\" of which each originally had it's own medical function. The pavilions are interconnected with each other by underground corridors. The buildings are a beautiful example of the so called Modernisme catal\u00e0 or Catalan Modernism movement (approx 1880 - 1911) which made it's own variation of the Art Nouveau / Jugendstil movement in other parts of Europe. Many traces of this movement can be found throughout the city, most notable from Antoni Gaud\u00ed The main building has stunning ceramics and beautiful staircases Not to be missed!"

The mosaic work was stunning! The gargoyles, the statues emoting all types of emotions, the history of the facility, the beautiful \"jardins\" (gardens, full of sqwaking parakeets) were all amazing!

I imagine the mental, emotional, and spiritual healing of he patients was aided strongly by their surroundings in Sant Pau. The only problem I had is that there are so many buildings, sections of buildings, and sections of the underground tunnels that are not accessible currently. I think some of the buildings are still in use, which is understandable, but some of the buildings and sections are cordoned off without explanation. It's worth seeing but hopefully they can open up more of the compound to public use to allow for greater value. Also, there are exits that they just don't let you use for no reason."

We took the underground - the station is located at the entrance to the new hospital so you have to walk round the block to get to the entrance. Although the tour was good the girl was very quiet and it was sometimes difficult to hear her if you were not right beside her.

A lucky few will stroll down the tree lined diagonal street (before or after Sagrada) to see this architectural masterpiece that was until recent years a functioning hospital! It almost makes one wish for illness because the hospital wards are/were beautiful. Compared to the dank and dark mid century hospitals that were built in the US this is leaps and bounds better. It's even preferable to the sort of sleek hotel like vibes you get from more modern hospitals; I have a sense that this place felt alive and beautiful, not like a depressing asylum or a soulless hotel-like modern hospital,Each structure is divided into provision of care for certain types of problems. Alas most are not open to the public but San Rafael and San Jordi are so you can get a sense of what the place was like when it was working. And the structures that are not open to the public are being put to good use for global public health agencies.Setting aside the buildings themselves this place is so peaceful early in the day. We arrived exactly at opening time and really enjoyed the scenery and serenity of the place with very few crowds. Highly recommended!"

I was in awe when first coming at the building. Unfortunately when we visited there was apparently a part closed, but we got in at a reduced ticket.You get a very short guidebook when entering explaining what happened here, what happened in the pavilions. As it is not too lenghty, it gives you a good idea what happened. We strolled around in the garden to and tried to imagine how it would be to be staying in this hospital. There are 3 buildings you can visit. The first one is of course the main building. Stroll around, look at the ceilings and see how nice they have renovated this site.The second building you can visit is on your right side when entering the garden, about halfway there. Here you will get a vision of how it was to stay as a patient in the pavilion. The 3rd building was actually super interesting. It as the same side, so left when facing back the main building. It was previous investigation quarter. What is supernice that each chamber, shows a different part of the renovation of this site. There are some super nice time lapse movies. It is here that I learned that they really tried to re-use each material and you can truly see how nice the pavilions (which are not all accessible) are.A must see"

My mother (a retired nurse) was the only one in our group who knew it existed. She studied Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner's hospital complex in nursing school. My husband and I didn't know much about it, but mom knew she had to see it. I'm so glad we took her advice. It was totally worth the entrance fee.There weren't many tourists around, which was actually quite nice. They must have all been inside the Sagrada Familia (another must see landmark). I totally get the Gaudi hype, but it reminds me too much of the Mona Lisa experience at the Louvre. There are so many other architects of that period that get ignored. It's nice to see works from other brilliant artists such as Montaner. It's amazing that an architect with no knowledge of the medical field was able to design such a well built complex. One that was still in use up until 2009. The buildings are very open and allow reflection of natural light. You can see how therapeutic it must have been for the patients to be able to see the beautifully landscaped courtyard from the windows. You'd never know that there were medical teams treating trauma patients in the tunnels beneath the complex. Just think about it as you're walking through the courtyard. I'd have to say that observing the exterior of the buildings, and the tour of the administrative building was the highlight for me. The ornate mosaic art, wood moldings, ironwork, stonework, and stained glass make it so attractive. A true Modernisme experience that shouldn't be missed."

A wonderful collection of art nouveau Spanish modernista buildings in a nine-square-block enclave, a city within the city that used to be a rambling hospital and is now a \u201ccampus of knowledge,\u201d home to the Spanish headquarters of seven international agencies, among them WHO and the United Nations University. Six of the 12 magnificently decorated hospital buildings have been restored and are on view (the others are in progress), and you can inspect the ornate tunnels that linked them and the grand gardens, designed as part of the hospital\u2019s restorative function. The place has only been open to the public since February, 2014, and clearly hasn\u2019t been discovered yet: we see only a couple of dozen people in our three-hour visit, a great contrast to the milling chaos around Sagrada Familia, just one bus stop back. Statues, carvings, ornate brickwork, decorative murals--we snap away entranced, then lie on the grass for half an hour, peaceful and serene in the heart of the city. Fresh and scented air, young blossoms on the trees, the slowly moving sun picking out the different shades on the shining roof tiles\u2014terracotta, yellow, blue, purple ... a significant addition to the schedule if you're even remotely interested in Barcelona\u2019s architectural saga, but a lovely and extraordinary place for anyone to visit."

The Recinte Modernista--until recently the Hospital de Sant Pau et de la Santa Creu--is one of the finest works of Luis Dominech i Montaner, one of the greatest European architects of the early 20th century. Designed with the welfare of the patient of paramount importance, it was beautifully laid out with gardens as well as lovely buildings. Visitors to Barcelona are often press-ganged into seeing only buildings by Antonio Gaudi, and miss many wonderful alternatives such as this complex. The buildings are in the process of being restored after the Hospital was moved to a new precinct to the north; this restoration has entailed removing many additions to the original structures, as well as recreating the gardens; and is being lovingly and carefully done. Several buildings, including the magnificent Administration Building, are completely restored--and breathtakingly beautiful. The guided tour adds a great deal of information to what is available in booklets and signage. NOT to be missed!"

A grid of fantastic Modernist buildings, each one decorated differently and occupying lovely gardens with orange trees and palms.

We had an amazing few hours walking around this old hospital which has been partially restored and is now a sightseeing attraction and administration offices facility. Only \u20ac8 for a self-guided tour and leaflet/guide (guided tours in different languages also available for slightly more). There are also attendants/guides about to ask questions and direct you. I was visiting with a friend who is a nurse so we were stunned that such a large, well planned, spacious hospital facility had ever been built and operated with so much open space/gardens for patients to use during their stay and such beautiful buildings inside and out. The gardens are amazing to walk around and you can go into and look around 3/4 of the buildings that have already been restored. Stunning history, architecture, art, mosaics, sculptures on the building and open spaces. Hardly anyone seemed to be getting off of the tourist bus at this stop but its worth a visit. Look all over the buildings from roofs to walls to floors. There is an obsite cafe we didn't use, a great reasonable priced gift shop where we picked up a few souvenirs and presents and some great places to eat and drink nearby. We spotted a gorgeous looking bakery on a nearby street we planned to visit another day but didn't make it back to and had a lovely lunch in a cafe/restaurant opposite on the crossroads (right hand side of the fountains as you look towards the building. They had menus in multiple languages, were welcoming and happy to explain the menu to us as we hadnt prepared our Spanish prior to our weekend away. My friend had a ham salad \u20ac8 (I think) and I had a combination platter of slices of sauteed chicken, potato omelette, pan con tomate, garlic sauteed mushrooms and salad which I would highly recommend for possibly \u20ac12."

That building is, of course, fascinating and impressive- but we were satisfied with photographing all the angles of the exterior, still undergoing construction. The line-ups to enter were a bit discouraging, so we strolled up a charming diagonal avenue to another Modernista \"attraction\"- the Hospital de la Santa Creu. The health care project, begun in 1902, was the dream and design of Lluis Domenich I Montaner - a series of exquisite pavilions and gardens, linked by white-tiled underground passages. Entering, after paying the reasonable eight euro entrance fee, you can watch an explanatory video and then walk through the passages, accompanied by slides of doctors and patients projected on those tiles. Two main pavilions are open, stripped down to their original beauty of design, and the administrative building has upper halls that are exquisite in their tiling and windows. The original design envisioned 145 square metres of indoor and garden space per patient- and the beauty of the space brings better emotional health even to the casual visitor. The place is well worth a visit- and it may pique a new interest in modern health care philosophy back in your own country!"

The original plan was for a very large site to be developed but in the end the size was more modest and some of the Pavilions (ward blocks) were not in the Art Nouveau style. Nevertheless what there is is stunning. The whole concept of light airy wards, gardens for the patients to enjoy and lovely surroundings the help the sick person feel better was a far cry from some cramped inner city hospitals of that time. The underground tunnels joining the blocks meant that services such as meals and laundry could be transported without heed to outside weather conditions. The hospital was used until 2009 and to keep up with modern healthcare advances many alterations and additions to the buildings had had to be made until the whole original construction was buried beneath making it unrecognisable. When it was decided to save and restore the whole site including replanting the gardens the planners took a very bold step and unflinchingly removed all later additions. Although not everything is yet returned to its previous pristine state a good deal is now visible so that a visit is well worthwhile. All modern services such as water, heating and lighting have been placed under the flooring and many of the buildings have been sensitively modernised for current day use by important bodies such as UNESCO and WHO in keeping with the sites health and social origins. It must have been and continue to be a hugely expensive project to carry out this work and it is to be hoped that tourism and other auspicious bodies using the building will help to fund its continuation and completion. The wonderful tiling and wood and stained glass and brick and stonework are exuberant and colourful and the gardens very pleasant areas to linger in. There are a lot of explanations about the sites origins with pictures and drawings and information about the architect and artists. There is also a good deal about the renovation work but as former nurses we would have loved to know more about how the site functioned as a hospital. Where was the pharmacy? How did the meals get up from tunnels into the wards as no ramps were evident. Maybe a guided tour would have told us these things but although the staff were perfectly pleasant and friendly they did not know very much about the building and although we tried several times we couldn't find anyone who knew very much. I realise this is very much a work in progress but I am sure like me there will be visitors hungry for more information. If I had felt more satisfied about getting answers to my queries I would easily have given five points. I also thought the entrance charge very reasonable."

I visited this place on my 6th day in Barcelona, I had seen plenty of modernist architecture around and still I thought this modernist complex was jaw-dropping. Just a short walk from La Sagrada Familia and with a reasonable admission charge (5.60\u20ac for under 29s), we opted for the self-guided tour as we were on a budget. The introductory video and the booklet you get when buying your tickets are a nice guide to the tour. After seeing the introductory video, we started the tour walking through the tunnels that connect the buildings. First we visited one of the non-restored buildings which houses an art exhibition at the moment. Here you can see how the restoration is still a work in progress in the complex and it has the potential to be an exciting project. Then we visited another building where inside restoration work was in progress. After we saw some of the great rooms restored within the main Administrative building and we end the visit seeing the exhibition displayed on the smallest building which takes you along the restoration project and the history of the modernist complex. I really enjoyed the visit to the modernist complex, it is a must see hidden gem."

The guide was excellent and the group quite small. There is little information around the site so a self guided tour might be challenging. The restoration of the site is ongoing but it is clearly a gem and the vision of the original architect and main donor was amazing. The Modernista decorative detail is as good as anything we have seen, especially in the exteriors and in the interior of the administrative building. It is, apart from the interior of Sagrada Familia, easily the best place to visit in Barcelona from a visual point of view. There are not many visitors yet so the atmosphere is quiet and peaceful which is a huge plus over just about everywhere else in the city."

Taken into account the recent restoration of the pavilions and the extensive art work in murals, stained glass and skilful art craft in all the complex, It is a must see if you'd like to see a different conception of art & health and have aesthetical enjoyment. Also, if you visit Sagrada Familia Church, Hospital Sant Pau is just 4 blocks away from it. You can take Paseo Gaudi, a pedestrian street full of local caf\u00e9s, restaurants and shops where you can rest while enjoying the mediterranean way of living and then proceed to Hospital Sant Pau with your batteries recharged.

It has only been open after renovation for a relatively short time, but the vast site with so many stunning old buildings that were hospital wards in the days when this area was outside the city walls, is really worth a visit. The English speaking guide was entertaining and very informative, not just about the site, but about the history and other Barcelona-related topics. You will not see anything like this site anywhere else in the world, it really is not to be missed.There is a fair amount of walking, much of it outside between the buildings."

On our recent trip to Spain to visit my husband's family, his cousin told us they wanted to take us to a place 5 minutes from their home that had \"Modern Art\" as translated form Catalan to English for me by my Hubby. I groaned inside, because I HATE modern art... I am a history buff and I LOVE old things. I decided not to complain, to be open minded, and to experience something with my husband's family that they were excited about showing us. Boy am I glad I did! This place was amazing! We took a tour in Catalan, and my hubby translated the pertinent info to me, but I was so busy snapping photos, that he let me wander off to ooh and aah to my hearts content. These photos are ones I snapped with my iphone to post on social media. The buildings are so gorgeous. Everything was meticulously restored. I love the idea behind this place... Built in the early 20th century by a man who said it had to be free to all people. The thought behind the lovely spaces was that in order to promote better healing, people needed a beautiful environment no matter their economic status. Do yourself a favor and go check this place out. The staff is very friendly, and they do tours in many languages. There was no line like the 5 hour wait at Sagrade Familia. It is straight down the street from there and the cathedral can be seen from the hospital."

If you only have a day or even just a few hours in Barcelona, go to Sagrada Familia and then walk straight up Avinguda de Gaudi to see Sant Pau Recinte Modernista. As an atheist health professional, this place struck even more of a chord with me than Sagrada Familia. It is hard to believe this entire hospital complex was built to such an astounding standard of architecture and mosaic interior decoration, inside and out...just wow, wow, WOW. The magnitude of this project in the early 1900's is mind-boggling, very sad to think that the architect Lluis Domenech Muntaner did not live to see the opening of this hospital (4 years after his death.) Really, you must see this - even if you think you are not the biggest fan of art, architecture or healthcare. Like the Sagrada Familia, do not miss it! This will be one of the highlights of all my European travels that I will remember for many years!We took a guided tour and it was very well worth it, with a self-guided tour you will still be able to see all the elements of the hospital complex but having a guide full of passion for the place who is able to tell you all about the facility and its history really made the experience for us. We booked onto the English tour online before we went but it did not appear that it was essential - we could have turned up at 12pm or 1pm and purchased tickets there."

There is an incredible Hall (why a hall in a hospital?) with the balcony balustrade crafted in gothic letters asking God in Catalan to \"help and support the donors and patients of this Holy House...\" I was there for well over an hour, which might be a longevity record for me.

It is here that Gaudi died, but it ceased being a hospital in the 1920s. It now houses the library of Catalonia and a cloister garden. Most of the photos at the head of this set of reviews (the ones that look medieaval) and at least one review is of this place.The old hospital was replaced by a hospital in modernist style by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner.

It is a Modernist masterpiece by the architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner and was finished in 1902. The hospital is located near the Sagrada Familia Basilica, and there are 26 pavilions in a Neo-Mudejar style around the spacious grounds. The pavilions are linked by underground tunnels and are surrounded by gardens that give an atmosphere of peace and quiet. The entrance pavilion is known as the Administration Building and has a tower and a clock. Domenech built the entrance building and 12 of the pavilions. Pere Domenech i Roura was his son and he built the rest of the pavilions and the Convalescence House. The old Hospital of the Santa Creu was founded in Ciutat Vella in 1401 and was the basis for the present hospital, which is Europe's second oldest and used continuously to the present day. Pau Gil was a Barcelona-born banker who was living in Paris, and in 1902 he donated a large amount of money to the hospital to expand it to the present site. The new hospital decided to add the saint's name of its benefactor, Sant Pau, to the name of the hospital to honor him.One can wander around the grounds. The large gardens with aromatic and medicinal vegetation were supposed to help patients recover from their illnesses. The pavilions are connected by a network of two km of underground tunnels. A new hospital has been built on the premises and the older buildings will be used for cultural purposes. The site was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997. Six of the 12 Art Nouveau pavilions have been restored during the last 5 years and this is now the most important Art Nouveau complex in Europe. Its architectural and cultural value have acquired an international dimension. The renovated complex was inaugurated in February, 2014. Many international institutions have settled in the hospital premises. Among the most significant spaces restored are the Administration pavilion, with its old Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner hall and its new conference rooms and auditoriums."

Independent pavillions assuring maximum sunlight and fresh air exposure, interconnected by service tunnels through which workers could service them without mixing with patients and visits, assuring maximum efficiency (for the time). Ok, they went a little bit nuts with the decoration, an ostentation for the benefactors of the time that payed for it... but then think first that being ill, you'll feel better in a beautiful environment than in a boring, ugly one, and that thanks to that, we can now enjoy this true jewel. I recommend that after visiting the Sant Pau Hospital, go to check the hospital it replaced, present day National Library Hospital de la Santa Creu, and compare, so you will understand the hughe leap forward the modernist hospital was. On the opposite, the recently built complex that now houses the hospital, looks sad and ugly, more like a cuarter of a mid XXth century penitentiary. A step backwards maybe?"

Best thing though was the food at the Cafe Modernista on the grounds. The \"Bread-Olive oil-Chocolate\" dessert was the most memorable thing we ate in our two week trip, and that is saying a lot!"

The Hospital de Sant Pau is a former hospital that was built with design in mind. It was designed to be a beautiful, functional building. If only all hospitals were like that! There are beautiful mosaics high and low and you just walk around marveling at the thought of this actually being a hospital at one time. The hospital is in the process of being renovated. While we were there an event was taking place so we weren't able to get the full effect, but the architecture is simply magnificent. This was actually my favorite \"tourist stop\" in the entire city. It is so much quieter than the Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell and you can really take your time and appreciate the beauty of the hospital."

We walked around the entire place , clicking pictures and soaking in the ambience. the fact that it was quiet and peaceful such added to the fun of it.We also entered the 2 pavilions that were open for display and appreciated the intricate interior work done and the tiles and the paintings.Time just flew by in here.

Renovations on the hospital have just been completed, which means that you will get to admire the site in its full glory. Many tourists visiting Barcelona may not even know that it's open, which means that you can simply walk in and buy a ticket to tour the site either independently or with the a guide speaking the language of your choice, with absolutely NO queues at all! This is a rare enough opportunity in a city as popular as Barcelona, so why not take advantage of it?Add to that the fact that an admission ticket is only 8 Euro, and that, if you're under 29 years old (bring some form of ID with you), you even get a discount for the already affordable price (coming up at only around 6 Euro).This is a restored hospital, with architecture so exquisite that you will hardly believe that the place was meant to heal, instead of entertain. There are holograms in the hallway, to remind visitors of the origins of the place, as well as an exhibit in one of the buildings that was once filled with patient beds.The side dedicated to the administration of the hospital is truly grandiose, with an elaborate staircase and ornate ceilings and statues - and I honestly feel like it could pass for an opera hall or an art museum any day.The lack of crowds meant that we got to enjoy the premises at our own pace, getting to take as many pictures as we wanted and admire the architecture, as well as the absolutely beautiful gardens, to our heart's desire.Take a seat on a bench outside and relax while watching the orange trees adding color to the beautiful gingerbread-like houses, and let the smell of lavender wash over you, as you listen to birds chirping above. It's a wonderful break from all the busy well known sites in the city, and is very easy to get to. All you have to do is get off at the Sant Pau/Dos de Maig metro station OR walk up the boulevard from the famous Sagrada Familia.Whatever you do, make sure to take advantage of the beauty and tranquility of Sant Pau Recinte Modernista, before word gets out!"

The architect who built this hospital more than a century ago had understood the necessity to talk to users and understand their needs before drawing and building. The result is a hospital incredibly modern both in its concept and its details. To understand this aspect and go further than the appearance, the guided tour (around 1.5 hour) is a must although the English is perfectible. Check the timetable on internet as there are not that many tours per day. It is also possible to walk around the whole site independently, only a few areas are reserved for guided tours.The renovation took a long time as it included demolition of whole floors and various medical installations but it is a true aesthetical and historical success (world heritage site)The nearest metro station is Sant Pau/dos de Maig (not hospital de Sant Pau). Sagrada familia is within walking distance. A few small and cheap but decent restaurants can be found in a radius of 200m from the entrance. There is a snack (not tested) on the site just near the entrance.A must in Barcelona whoever you are, a double-must if you study architecture to learn how to understand users needs !"

Several of the group on the tour left in frustration. We saw much more wandering around outside on our own afterwards, even though parts of the site were fenced off due to building work.

We learned about the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau here on Trip Advisor and were pleased that we were able to include a tour during our recent trip to Barcelona. \u00a0As noted by others, the hospital, designed by Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner in the early 1900s and since replaced by an adjacent, more modern (and, IMHO, quite ugly) hospital complex, is currently undergoing renovation to become a research and educational facility. \u00a0What a remarkable and beautiful hospital it once was! \u00a0Our tour with an English-speaking guide took us through the grounds and into several buildings in varying stages of renovation. \u00a0We saw wards with beautiful mosaic tiles and huge windows to allow natural light and views of gardens and much more. \u00a0So much attention was paid to designing an environment conducive to recovery (but once recovered, why would one want to leave?). \u00a0There are museum-style exhibits in several areas. \u00a0Our guide sometimes stopped to point out a photograph at one of them, but there was no time to look at any further--perhaps they are for the next phase of the renovation? \u00a0Prior to our tour, we watched a short video in the small visitors center. \u00a0It provides an excellent overview of the modernista movement and specifically focused on Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner. \u00a0There are also a couple of exhibits on the walls of the center.A few points about logistics: \u00a01) \u00a0Our guide spoke rapidly and \u00a0was sometimes difficult to understand. \u00a0Although she took questions, she seemed in a rush. \u00a0We were on the last tour of the day, and indeed, she may have been rushing as the staff seemed eager to lock the gates and go home when we were done. \u00a0Perhaps this was an atypical experience, but it may be best to avoid the last tour of the day. \u00a02) At the visitor center, we purchased the Ruta del Modernisme guidebook (\u20ac12), which came with discount coupons for many Barcelona sites; we also purchased a second set of coupons for \u20ac5. \u00a0The coupons for the hospital saved us half off the \u20ac10 per adult admission price, and we saved on admission fees elsewhere on subsequent days; plus, the guidebook is excellent. \u00a0I recommend this purchase if you\u2019ll be visiting several of the covered sites (or just want the guidebook). \u00a0However, do check the coupons before leaving the counter as they are good for one year and are supposed to be stamped with the expiration date; ours were instead stamped with the purchase date! \u00a0We were fortunate that the Modernisme Centre at Placa Catalunya kindly remedied the problem for us the next day. \u00a03) \u00a0A few benches and a water vending machine are somewhat hidden just outside the center, up the hill--we discovered them only as we were leaving, but would have welcomed waiting for our tour in this spot. \u00a0There are bathrooms inside the visitors center. \u00a04) Other reviewers have mentioned wandering through the grounds on their own. \u00a0While we were there, some folks asked at the visitors center about doing this and were told they could not, but they tried anyway; the guard at the inner gate turned them away. \u00a0Others seemed to be confused about the tour times. \u00a0I suspect that the tour/visit situation may be dynamic depending on the stage of the renovation. \u00a0It\u2019s best to double check the tour times before heading there. \u00a0However, even if you miss the tour, you can look into the complex from outside the gate and see many of the beautifully tiled buildings and get a small taste of Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner\u2019s amazing creation inside."

As the architect was also from the Modernisme movement this tour helped us to understand it's key concepts. We took the English tour.Although you can wander round the building for free there is no information and many areas are sectioned off due to the building works.Donned in builders vests and hard hats (the whole site is being renovated) we were taken all over the building - over the pavillions, into side rooms, in the corridors which went under the building, in the doctor's operating areas and into a ward. What made this tour so interesting was the thought that went into the design and the innovation for it's time. Patients mental health was as important as their physical health, hence an emphasis on light and their well being. The aesthetics were also part of the healing process. We were awed at the beautiful tiles, which were a nod to the Catalan history. The last room we visited, one of the wards, made my jaw drop - it was covered, from floor to ceiling, with exquisite tiles. It was also fascinating to learn how the building has been used over time and to see the different levels the ceilings were put in at later dates and how they are being removed to renovate it back to it's original design. I would highly recommend seeing this building and prioritising a visit before it is fully renovated so you can learn about it's history as it is being restored. We found the entrance for the guided tour a little difficult to find. When you come out of the metro turn right, you will see the new hospital, which is built behind the old hospital. Continue on this road to the end, which is parallel with the new hospital, then turn left and follow the steep road down, at the bottom of the road turn left. You will then fiind the entrance, as you go in there is a mobile building which is the tourist entrance, and has toilets and a waiting area. There are a few cafes and bakeries opposite the road if you arrive early. If I haven't persuaded you enough to take the tour bear in mind all the proceeds go to renovating the building and if you are over 65 it is free."

He knew all about the history of the hospital as well as modernist architecture and the modernist movement. There is a short portion of the tour in a renovated building, but the rest of it is all through the hospital grounds which is in the process of renovation. We found it difficult to be certain about tour information before we went, so here's the current information--the tourist office is open from 9:30-1:30pm. Tours in English are at 10am, 11am, 12noon, and 1pm; 10 euro each. I'll include a photo of the hours and tours in other languages.If you are going to Park Guell afterward, you can catch a bus right outside the entrance to Sant Pau--the 92 bus stops at the parking lot at Park Guell and takes 15-20 minutes from the hospital."

I had a lot of favorites during my trip to Barcelona this past February but my two highlights were the Palau de Musica and the Hospital de Sant Pau. Of course both were designed by the same architect, Lluis Domenech i Montaner, a Catalan art nouveau modernist. The hospital is undergoing a renovatioin so you have to wear a hard hat and safety vest during the tour. There are a number of buildings in the compound and each one is a beautiful piece of architecture. There are underground tunnels that connect the buildings. The tile work is impressive and colorful. Rather than being a drab hospital, this place was a strikingly different place to be sick in because it uplifts you with the colors and design features. It will be interesting to see the finished product when the renovation is completed."

Is being renovated so you only get to see parts, but the tour is interesting and to be fair if you visit you need to do the tour else it is a very limited experience. Hourly tours in english from about 10-2 (might be on the half hour, just check). We went on metro and walked afterwards down towards Sagrada. Get off at Sant Pau / Dos de Maig (L2) not Guinardo / Hospital de Sant Pau (L4) as the latter takes you to the new hosiptal and you have to wander round the block to the information centre that sell the tickets.You can get a small discout with a barcelona card or the like, otherwise 10 euros each."

It lies just up the road from La Sagrada Familia, & is no less monumentally eccentric. Actually it's many buildings - part Gothic cathedral, part Teutonic fortress, part sultan's palace, its roofline is a riot of spires, beehive water towers & gaudily tiled domes, & its flanks are decorated with heraldic symbols & heroic-scale frescoes of the hospital's benefactors. Since June 2009, the ambulances have pulled up in front of a new hospital that's been tacked on at the back, & the majestic old buildings are slowly being transformed into a museum & cultural centre. I highly recommend stopping by the hospital. It's about a block from the Hospital de Sant Pau metro stop."

The innovations that were put in place at the time are really wonderful. Focusing not just on the physical health - but also the mental well being of their patients. Truly ahead of it's time.At the end of the tour you'll be invited to have a look at the language center and walk around the site. Don't take a miss on that.

If you go more towards the right you will find the new hospital which looks very similar to the old part except for a lack of decoration. The architecture and work put into the old hospital is absolutely amazing. Our guide was wonderful and talked about the fact that the idea of this hospital for the poor was to fight against industrialism and bring in nature to heal. Thus a motif of flowers, animals, gardens, etc. use of colors...the ideas that many hospitals are now going back to nowadays! We only had three people on our english tour so it was very personalized.

We took the metro to it, but you come out on the other side of the complex by the modern hospital and have to walk all around to get to the entrance. It was built to look out towards the sea, so to approach it from the Sagrada Familia up the Avinguda de Gaudi would have been better.At the moment it is a building site but there is still plenty to see. The tour begins in a Portakabin and there is a good video presentation you can watch while waiting. The guide was brilliant - very enthusiastic and informative.

Taxi drivers usually mistake it as a small town or village as they drive their passengers through the complex with gardens at every turn. There's a church built for the patients and locals who live around the hospital complex, the Saint Paul's church is a small scale replica of Santa Maria del Mar church in the old Born neighborhood. The idea for building such a complex was originated back in 14th century to unite all small hospitals and medical researches to one huge facility. The old Hospital de Sant Pau of 14th/15th century is still standing today in the Gothic neighborhood downtown Barcelona, though it serves an art center and library. It is quite a shame that they move everything to the new Hospital of Saint Pau built right behind it and recently inaugurated.
