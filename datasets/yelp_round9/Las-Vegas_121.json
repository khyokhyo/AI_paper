Not to forget the food was cold when I got it home. Very disappointed. Train your chef to pull off the sticker .  ALSO there were still seeds from the pepper on the actual pepper and the onions weren't cooked all the way. Appetite completely lost."

            "review": "Eh. What a complete letdown. And honestly, waste of money.\n\nFirst things first, the positives. The service was great. Our server was super nice and patient with us. The owner (I'm assuming) went around the restaurant, making sure everyone was happy and was served. The space itself was nice and spacious.\n\nAaand on to the not so good. Mainly the food. I wasn't expecting authentic Chinese food, but you know, at least decent food. This was not decent. The family and I got: calamari, Singaporean street noodles, Buddha's Feast, and the Chino-Latino Pineapple pork. The calamari was alright, bland and wasn't crispy. The sauce it came with didn't compliment the calamari at all. It almost overpowered it. The Singaporean noodles had potential, but it was wayy too salty. I ordered the Buddha's Feast, expecting it to be like a Buddha's delight sort of thing: veggies with brown sauce. What I got: steamed vegetables with some pieces of tofu. NO SAUCE. Like, wtf? I wouldn't have gotten that if I knew I was only getting steamed vegetables. I just doused it with some soy sauce because I needed some kind of flavor. The Chino-Latino pineapple pork wasn't bad at all actually. It the pork was a bit crisp, and the pineapple salsa ish topping was good. Also, my sister ordered this coconut refresher (can't remember the exact name) and it was just like coconut milk out of the can with a shitton of sugar. Not good.\n\nWith the quality of the food being not good, the price they charge is not worth it. At all. You're pretty much paying for the ~ambiance~. All four of us were disappointed by the end of the meal, and it was a consensus that we could get much better Chinese food at any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. My brother even said that Panda Express food is better. And I agreed. It was that bad.\n\nSo overall, not good, not worth it, just go to Chinatown."

When I called in the order, they said it would take 25 min. \nSo when I arrived at the restaurant 25 min later, (btw I waited by the to-go register for at least 5 min without even being acknowledge by any of the staff) I was told that the order just went in and it would take another 40 min. So I just cancelled my order and walked out.\nIf they would've just told me on the phone when I called in order that it would take an hour, I would've been ok with that. I could've waited at home for an hour doing something worthwhile instead of wasting my time waiting at the restaurant. But they lied and said it would only take 25 min.\nIt's too bad their service is horrible because I like their food.\nI will NOT be going here again."

The manager was just at r table telling us the kitchen was behind and did not even offer free drinks or anything, any other place would have offered something. Well is total BS we sat here watching several other people get their meals and desserts and we still have not gotten r food yet. This is such BS we r not coming back here. We asked them to box r food up at this point. None of this should reflect the waiter. The manger is a BIG ASSHOLE here. He should be fired. They should have given r whole meal free after everything we went thru. People that had sate down after we had were leaving and we had not even gotten r dinner yet.

Walked in and got a strange vibe. Barely friendly, very much to the point. \"Have you picked the entrees you want?\"  Our server had lots of facial hair and we would watch him touch his beard and put chapstick on in the back, but never saw him wash his hands. That grossed us out.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, we both ended up full but it's definitely not authentic chinese. I remember coming here after a trip to China and having been disappointed I never came back. Either way it filled us up but it wasn't anything special.\n\nI feel like this place tries so hard to pass off as elegant and what not, but I just wasn't getting that from this experience. Hardly friendly people, without good sanitation practices, with over priced entrees that you could somewhere else with larger portions for a cheaper price.  \n\nSafe to say my boyfriend and I left disappointed and agreed that we wouldn't ever come back. I don't get why other people would get so excited about coming here. Nothing special."

It wasn't his station but he was kind enough to take up my order on a busy friday night. When I was leaving, I had asked for the manager. He came out, shook my hand, introduced himself, and I complimented him on his employee. He asked me if I lived in the summerlin area, I told him no, I drove 20 miles to get here. He said to me very smuggly \"oh.. well have a good night.\" I'm here again on a saturday afternoon, the place is half empty, and the service is just as bad.

The ordering process was expectedly flawless but the food was horrible. I'm not sure if it had been sitting out but I arrived at 3:16p after being quoted a 3:15p pick up time.\n\nI ordered Mongolian  beef with the excitement of putting the white rice  in it to soak up all of the juicy sweet sauce and was bummed to find that the rice was laying in a deserted sea of just beef  and green onions. I can only imagine the rice's disappointment that it would not live up to its full potential of soaking up deliciousness. Instead the rice was pushed to the side like an unwanted one night stand.\nThe shrimp  fried rice tasted like it had seen better times but was forced to hang out in the red light district (heat lamp) before being reheated and deviously pawned off as new. There is no way that was fresh fried rice. \n\nI also ordered Kung Pao Chicken for my husband who can be somewhat of a Changs hater so I don't always trust his opinion but today he was right. Never a fun moment for a wife to admit that her husband is right. I took a bite and it too was dry and devoid of any sauce. \n\nI think today Changs made itself look like Panda, maybe even worse."

Me nor my children(4) had ever eaten there before but my husband had but not the location on Rampart and not in the last 5 1/2yrs.  We arrived on a Saturday without reservations (they take and plz make reservations before hand) a little 5:30pm.  The hostess greeted us and advised us of a 40-60 minute wait.  We were in no rush. We waited all of 40 minutes , despite some ppl walked in with no reservation or in parties of 2 or 3 were seated in booths large enough to accommodate 6ppl 2 adults and 4 kids. I was highly dissatisfied where they seated us and requested a manager. Dave the manager listened and re-sat us, not to mention he sent over lettuce wraps which were  phenomenal! David our server who I planned on tipping only 15% because i was livid, earned every bit of the 22% tip. David the server was versed in menu items, drinks, and was so personable we enjoyed ourselves!  Dave the manager was equally as knowledgeable if not more and earned our returned business. Dave was on the floor the entire time checking in on the guest and clearly a support to his team! Awesome food, awesome service, will definitely come back!"

While driving around I spotted it and he said, \"really? I wanted to take you to a real restaurant, not fast food. Let's just go to P.F. Chang's.\" \n\nAnyway, we head on over and walk right in. It was stuffy and loud inside so we jumped at the opportunity to sit out on the patio. It was nice outside and the weather was gorgeous. There was a little boy that spent the entire time dancing and jumping around an empty table and waiving at cars. That was pretty entertaining. \n\nWe ordered - he had orange peel chicken and an iced tea, I had Mongolian beef... but with lamb instead, with extra chili pods, and water. The orange peel chicken was just okay, and my dish came with a canapy of green onions and not too much meat, although it was delicious. The \"mild sauce\" that our waitress, Ashley, made was, according to Lawrence, \"tasteless.\" Ashley was a little... eh. My water glass was empty most of the meal, and that drives me crazy. \n\nFor $35 + $10 tip, the food is just not worth the price. PF Chang's has definitely gone down hill. Although I had a great time with Lawrence, we could have had just as good a time at a cheaper restaurant."

The Dumplings (with pork) were tasty, but a little greasy. \n\nFor entrees: No one seemed to care for the veggie dish (Buddha's Feast?) with tofu, broccoli, green beans and mushrooms. The sauce was a little thick and a little too sweet. The Beef with Broccoli was my favorite. The orange chicken was good - crispy with an oniony background. (I'm not sure if this was the \"kids favorite\" Crispy Honey Chicken or the Orange Chicken, since the menu says they peel oranges for this dish, and I didn't see any orange peel, but there was definitely an orange flavor.) The shrimp served on top of crispy rice noodles (Crispy Honey Shrimp, I believe) was good, but the outsides of the shrimp had a slightly strange texture. The lo mein (served meatless) was decent, the rice was perfectly cooked.\n\nService was very good, something that's not easy with a party of 30."

            "review": "I gotta say, I have been a fan of PF Changs for some time as a go to option for \"higher end\" Asian food. I was let down this time though . Granted we stopped in during several of the largest trade shows in Las Vegas, so the restaurant was PACKED, but it just didn't seem like anyone was on their game. My friend and I (no, it's not what you think!) stopped in to get looking for some decent, non casino food and we left really wanting. This is one of the \"smaller\" locations it seemed in both parking lot and restaurant size, so that probably magnified the difficulties they had. Our experience started off when we pulled in to the parking lot and were greeted by the valet telling us the only option, other than across the street was to valet our \"big ole truck\". This wasn't a big deal as we didn't want to walk anyways. However, we were a bit irked when the valet told us we needed to get out car, or at least the key within the next hour and a half as they would be closing at 10ish, valet included. I almost voiced an opposition to continuing in as I did not want to be rushed in what already seemed like a packed restaurant...This is VEGAS for crying out loud!\nNo worries. We did get seated pretty fast as there was only two of us. The waiter definitely got this place an additional star as he was attentive and informative. He got out orders in and going in great order and stopped by several times to refill us on drinks. We ordered a few standbys, Kung Pow chicken and Crispy beef. What a let down! The chicken appeared to be saut\u00e9ed chicken and peanuts with a little sauce, and my beef was too chewy for my liking. Both made us think that perhaps we had gotten the PF Changs frozen entr\u00e9e's they now sell in the supermarkets? The highlight for me was the house ginger beer. I must have had three of these damn things. I enjoy a good, unique beer and this was killer! This was a light tasting heff type unfiltered beer with a fantastic sweet/spicy aftertaste of genuine ginger. I might hit up the local PF Change to see if they have this on it's own.\nI guess we went in hoping for average to above average and left feeling we got below average from a restaurant chain that makes it's reputation on being above average. I'll give them a second chance, but in a town with almost as many eating options as ways to loose your money, why try again?"

It was very crowded at 1130am, and this was due to the fact that the servers crowded everyone into one side of the restaurant. The food was okay, tasted kind of like Panda Express with nice plates. I ordered the ahi tuna roll, shrimp with lobster sauce and a side of brown rice, fried green beans, orange chicken with white rice, two teas, and a tossed salad. The best part of the meal was the salad. All of the items were tasteless. My server was amazing though and made sure to check in on my friend and I intermittently, our drinks were never empty.\n\nI'm taking away 2 stars because the dining area was dark and crowded. 3 stars for the waiter and how quickly our food was brought out to us. Bill came up to about $65 with tip, not worth it IMO. I won't eat here again,"

It's in a booshie part of town, so yes, you will get the Bentley's, Mercedes, blah, blah here. \n\nWhat I really like is their outside seating area. When it's winter time, they have heaters and clear covers in the patio area so that there's less cold air coming into the seating area. There was a large group of high school kids getting ready for homing coming that sitting across from us, a group of about 20, so if you're the type that likes to dine with a gigantic group, they have the capability to accommodate you, I'm sure they need notice for a group that large though. \n\nI liked their food, it's basically over priced Chinese food with modernized, Chinese looking decor in the restaurant. Honestly, I'd rather go to some place in China Town. The only reason why we end up going to any PF Chang's is because we have a gift card. But, it does the job. \n\nThe service is great, very attentive... But I expect that, considering the location of this restaurant. :)"

We were seated in about 1/2 the time we were told which was super and when I explained my food restrictions the waitress was very sweet and went back to grab a special list of food items.  Instead of her bringing out the list the manager Todd came out to us and went over options and even assured us they would cook our food in a fresh pan with new oil etc - which we thought was pretty great!  Our order of vegan choices were delicious...however, accidentally the waitress brought out shrimp dumplings instead of our vegetable dumplings and it wasn't discovered until I ate one and was halfway through the second one which might explain why it was extra delicious....(I AM SO SORRY SHRIMP FAMILY -- truly it was an accident)\n\nThe waitress felt so bad and apologized for the mistake - I am sure this will never happen again...she saw how choked up I was about it - as I was crying for the shrimp a little....but she was so empathetic and took full responsibility for the error and of course later a woman from the back (chef maybe?) came out to also apologize and made us a vegetable batch at no charge...At the end of the dinner, believe me the food for us was great, even for the two at our table that are carnivores they loved their chicken and enjoyed our vegan choices as well.  By the time we were done packing up our left overs - Todd came over again and had told us he had taken care of our dinner as well as gave us a card to come back again and try the vegan dishes all over again.  We couldn't have been more grateful for the AMAZING service from him as well as the wonderful people that he has on his team.  They may not be vegan now...but with that kind of care & compassion...it might be in their future one day.  \n\nWe are now a fan of this PF Changs - I am huge on great service and I felt they completely handled it they way I would have and I am thrilled to see that in a large restaurant chain!  Great job!"

This review is based on a particular server at the Rampart location where I met a friend for lunch today.  A server other than my waitress brought out the food with white rice on the plate.  I told him I ordered brown rice.  He said that's not how he received the order.  He didn't want to correct the problem.  I then asked him if he could take it back and give me brown rice.  He said he could but he didn't want to get his germs in my food.  Excuse me?!  Was he threatening to spit in my food, or what?  Then he reluctantly agreed to bring me some brown rice and as he sauntered off like he was strolling in the park, he started twirling his tray in the air!! I have never, in my life, encountered a server so intent on offending a customer.  The waitress (Nano) brought the brown rice and swapped it for the white on my plate.  Usually the service is good, but this guy was unbelievable!  I won't be going back to this location and plan to talk to the GM at the GVR location about it.  This shouldn't happen in ANY restaurant!"

The interior is like every other P.F. Chang's and the food also is.... same.\n\nThat in itself would probably rank itself in a 4 star category if you're not going down to Chinatown for the real thang.\n\nHowever, the one star deduction came from the terrible misplacement of their Curb-side service.  First, curb-side usually designates that someone will probably come out to take your order or what not.   Instead, this location decided to place the signage out behind their dumpster area.  And there's no video camera or anything so no one comes out to meet you or bring your food.  You still have to head over to the front entrance and get your food from the bar area.\n\nSecond, they blocked off the sidewalk with their outdoor patio gate.  So you'll walk the long way around to get to-go food.  It's not only an afterthought for curb-side service, it's a terrible location and there's not a dedicated area for it.  If you're going to do it, do it right.  I'd probably take pointers from Darden's (Outback/Carrabba's) who's had a pickup window/door for a while and they even re-implemented their areas in older venues.\n\nI would probably suggest that they re-do this with the parking that's facing the entrance to make this a more viable solution.  Picking up to-go food at the bar is so 1990s."

The food I ordered was equally as pleasing.  I went for lunch and ordered Ginger Chicken with Brocolli and brown rice in the lunch sized portion. I was worried the lunch portion would be too small but it turned out to be just right.  My meal came out fast, hot and fresh. The chicken was tender and the brocolli still slightly crisp. Mixing the sauce and the brown rice was a good way to go. The egg flower soup at the beginning of the meal was good in its own right but had a flavor I am not used to.  I ordered hot green tea. They were out of the regular organic and so they brought me tropical green tea instead. It was a little sweeter and fruitier than the tea I really wanted but it was still good. I had that pot empty by the end of my meal. To finish off my meal I ordered tiramisu for dessert. This was the only disappointing part of the meal. The taste was good but it was frozen. I've never had frozen tiramisu before. Perhaps I was just there too early and it had not defrosted yet. Whatever the case my overall experience was favorable. I got a good meal, hot tea and dessert for $17.51. Not bad. And I had a $25 gift card that now has $7.49 remaining. Maybe I'll go back and get a dessert trio."

So we went for it.\n\nI was totally surprised.  The Hot & Sour Soup, while not overwhelmingly spicy, was delicious, not overly glutinous, and had a generous helping of both pork and tofu.  \n\nThe lettuce wraps were very good, and we were offered a second helping of lettuce, since the first batch didn't make a dent in the large portion of chicken and crispy rice noodles.  \n\nBy that time we were pretty full, so dinner tomorrow night will be our leftovers:  that excellent Sesame Chicken, and the Kung Pao Shrimp, which was terrific, but would have been even better if I ever could remember to have the kitchen NOT add any additional salt.  Even my husband enjoyed it, and he doesn't like shrimp!!  Best of all was the absence of the pools of grease that I remember from the Strip location.  There was even a lot less oil than we get at our usual New York Chinese Restaurant go-to, and the ambience is a lot nicer.\n\nThe Prix Fixe includes two desserts, and there are eight mini desserts to choose from, all served in shooter glasses.  I had the Lemon Tres Leche [sic], which didn't taste at all like the usual Tres Leches dessert, but was astoundingly good, so much so that the little shooter seemed much more dessert than I should be eating.  Hubby had the Apple Pie, and liked it a lot.  But mine was better!!\n\nOur server, Nancy, was outstanding - everything a server should be:  friendly, helpful, patient, efficient, and accommodating.  \n\nAll in all, we had a terrific meal in an attractive place, and would have enjoyed it just as much if we actually had to pay for it!"

Service was okay, nothing overly jubilant, just forgettable. Bartender was a bit stoic and robotic but very attentive. \n\nBack home we used to joke that P.F. Changs was the only Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale because it's always always crowded.  They do serve quality food and drinks and offer a gluten free menu and terrific drink options.  Full bar, beer and my latest discovery...strawberry and cucumber non-alcoholic refresher! Wow! During the hot summer scorching days this will cool you off so order one!\n\nWe also snacked on Edamame, Lettuce Wraps, Lemon Scallops and a side dish of stir fried Asparagus.  All winners! We usually always get the scallops which by the way aren't even on the menu but because they're fabulous P.F. Changs they whip it up for us every time.\n\nDon't miss this place!"

I've been a huge fan since I was 12, and unfortunately tonight ruined it for me for the rest of my life. I went in for a celebratory dinner with my boyfriend, whereupon we checked in with the two smug looking hostesses who didn't seem thrilled with their jobs.We watched as countless parties were seated before us as well as another party of three which was waiting since before we arrived. A gentleman from said party of three grew frustrated and went up to smug hostess number one and asked why some of these tables were sat before him, to which she explained the first table had a reservation, and he had overheard that the second table (a party of 4) did not have a reservation when they checked in but were still seated before him. He asked why and she didn't seem to have any answer but apologized lightly, he then resumed his seat and my boyfriend and I watched smug hostess number one look around for hostess number two, or any other employee for that matter, to make extra smug eye contact with as if to communicate her irritation with this group, though she was wrong. STRIKE ONE. Once my boyfriend and I were finally seated, a nice server came to help us. We both ordered ice waters without lemon. When the water arrived and I plunged my straw into said water, I was astonished to see a cloud of murk emerge from the depths of my cup. It looked like random white floaty shreds of gunk. I don't know what this unknown substance was, but needless to say, I lost my appetite. STRIKE TWO. It made me question the cleanliness of the entire establishment, and it made me feel dirty and I honestly can say I won't be going back ever. I'm sad about this because I love the garlic noodles here, but I will have to live without them for fear of eating from dirty dishes. It's disgusting. The health board should probably investigate this... I don't think proper procedure and cleanliness are being executed."

Right after we sat down she was impatient and she wanted us to choose our orders right after we sat down, who does that? Business wasn't booming.\n\nSecond night the waitress was much better. Even though the food came out bland again, she at least asked how the food was and offered to get it fixed. She was also very attentive to our needs and was always refilling our water glasses.\n\nI have been to the PF Chang's in San Diego several times and have loved the food each time. Either there is a disconnect and a communication breakdown between the waitresses and the cooks, or the cooks are not preparing the food properly, or the waitresses aren't putting in the orders correctly.\n\nAnyways, I am rambling: the summation is: the food was not tasty.\n\nChinese food is supposed to be bursting with flavor, even if it's not necessarily a great flavor...it's not supposed to be bland. It's not supposed to be expensive either...but I could deal with that if the food was good.\n\nThis was probably the worst PF Changs I have been to in any regard.\n\nBut I spare the criticism of our waitress the second time, Janelle.

I had never been to a PF Chang's and was excited to learn of their gluten free menu.\n\nI came to this location on a Wednesday night around 9:30 and let the hostess know I wanted to place an order to go. She directed me to the end of the bar to place my order which was taken fairly quickly and I was offered water while I waited for my food. I didn't notice the time, but I didn't feel I waited longer than you would expect to wait for food to be made. I ordered the GF lemon chicken with brown rice and the chocolate dome. The chicken was still warm and crunchy (not soggy like I was afraid it might be) by the time I made it back to my hotel room only about a half mile down the road. I dumped the rice next to the lemon chicken and broccoli, poured some of the lemony sauce and some of the gluten free soy sauce they sent home with me over the rice and enjoyed every bite using the chopsticks I found in my takeout bag (also in the bag was a plate, fork/napkin combo and 2 fortune cookies that I was warned were NOT gluten free, but everybody should have the opportunity to at least read their fortune even if they don't eat the cookie). \n\nThe chocolate dome is a dense, fudgy, flourless chocolate blob (it was actually a very nice round shape vs a true blob) that by itself is ok. Topped with the berry sauce and eaten with the raspberries, blueberries and strawberries it comes with is what made it really good. I ate my whole entr\u00e9e and the whole freakin' blob when I probably should have stopped about half way through both. I'd definitely like to visit the Salt Lake location and try something else.

If I ever have to recommend a place it will be this one. The staff are amazing and the atmosphere is very inviting and welcoming. Thank you so much Shelby and Patrick!! Patrick and I had a great date night and a memorable one with the great service we received. So Happy!!!! Thank you!!!! We will be back again for our future date nights!!\n\nSo I guess I had such a great time last time I forgot to post my review.\nMy boyfriend and I returned again today, and we had a blast. Patrick was here again and remembered us. Such great customer service. It really made us feel welcomed. Maria was our bartender today. We got great service and felt at home. This will be our number one spot for when we go out. Thank you Patrick and Maria! You guys really made our day amazing.

We also got some spicy chicken, eggplant, garlic spinach and fried rice. The food was ok and my memory hadn't failed me. The garlic noodles were again my favorite dish. The chicken and eggplant were entirely too sweet for my taste. The fried rice was ok and so was the spinach, but I was hoping for more garlic flavor. I wish I only ordered the garlic noodles and if I ever come again (which isn't likely) I would stick with them again. \n\nService was ok. Our server was attentive at first but when a large party came in refills became a little more infrequent. He apologized and tried to be as attentive as possible, which we appreciated. \n\nOverall, it's a chain, so they are all pretty standard and this one doesn't stand out in any way either negatively or positively."

The food is good and I have to say it actually is one of my favorite chain restaurants. I have dined at this particular location many times before without incident and experienced quite excellent service, but like I said I am writing this review for a reason. My family dined here last Saturday evening (May 18th) for my Grandmother's 81st birthday. The food was good but the service was some of the worst I have ever experienced. We were a party of 8 so the waiter of course was already receiving the auto 18% gratuity so he seemed like he couldn't care less. he also was clearly stoned off his ass (I'm not knocking I used to be a stoner myself and was dining with a few but I'm just stating facts here). We place our order and a lot of the food came out at different times when my husband and I mentioned that our appetizer did not yet come and the meals had. You could tell that he completely forgot about the appetizer, claimed he put in the order and about 15 minutes after we received our meal, low and behold our appetizer showed up (it was an uncooked appetizer BTW it was more than obvious he forgot). The same thing happened with my sister's appetizer, when she mentioned it you could tell he completely forgot then said, \"Hey man I totally put the in order all at the same time I wish I was back in the kitchen cooking but I can't be they are totally backed up\", in his best stoner/surfer valley girl accent ( I am also a valley girl). The appetizer eventually came at the end of our meal and it was the wrong one and my sister told them to just take it back and off the bill. My grandfather ordered a beer and it was one that only came in a bottle, fine no problem, my husband also ordered a beer at the exact same time, 20 minutes later my husband's beer shows up (draft beer) and my Grandfather's does not, my Grandfather tells the waiter to just cancel it, his response \"Are you sure man it's only gonna take 5 more minutes it's on it's way the bar is just backed up\", (the restaurant is maybe at 60% capacity and the waiter has 4 tables to work, including ours). No just cancel it how does a bottled beer take longer than a draft and why did the first one take 20 minutes to begin with? He clearly forgot until my Grandfather mentioned that he cancel it. My cousin's wine order, 30 minutes. He passed our table and promised to refill our water glasses no less than 4 times, every time saying I'll be right back to refill your water glasses, clearly forgetting to grab the pitcher every time then seeing them he would remember. His shirt was filthy, when he bagged our food he spilled more than half of it down the side of the bag. We had a warrior card that we presented at the beginning of the meal, he told us he would take it for our discount and never did and when he brought the bill which had the beer that never came, the appetizer that was canceled and no discount we had had enough. Now the way I work is I always tip even with bad service, I just tip less. Normally about 10-15% for bad and 20-25% for good but there was no way this guy was getting 18% after all of this . My sister got up to find a manager to talk to them about the bill because we were done dealing with this awful waiter she spoke with the manager the bill was adjusted she took off the 10% for the warrior card the 18% gratuity and comped some drinks, great. Then when my sister was headed back to the table for us to handle the adjusted bill she passed the waiter and he offered to take the bill my sister told him \"no thanks you haven't been much help tonight I got it\" and here's the kicker, he told her to \"f*** off\"! So crazy! We didn't report this part to the manager because at this point we could not get out of there fast enough and we had been there over 2 and half hours at that point. What an a$$, little did he know he was just talking himself out of a tip. The bill was adjusted down about $100 and we left a 10% tip on that adjusted bill but had he not been such an ass and told my sis to f*** off we would have left 15% on the original amount and called it a night. If he had said f*** off to me I would have made sure he was fired. He also topped it off with talking shit about us with another table he had just seated right behind us. He had just started off with them and was making the same excuses he had been with us but they had no clue what they were in for, they even joked with him about reporting him to the manager which was clearly a shot at us. The only pleasure I took in that was knowing what shitty service they were in for and how much they would come to regret that comment. As it is I will never dine at this PF's again, I will stick to my side of town."

One or two layers of this crap actually tasted edible, if only in small concurrent quantities.\n\nThis spot reflects on Americans' taste in food the way the WCW... u get the idea. Quality of all chain restaurants seems to experience the same sad decline that has befallen applebees, the olive garden, et al.--which threw quality under the bus for profit margins. \n\nThe next time I crave a cheap and decent chain-y meal, I'll drive my bourgeoisie romp to the Cheesecake Factory or Ri Ra."

The waiter was mike and he was great, he gave us a lot of time to choose what we wanted and didn't make us feel like we were in a rush and I appreciate that.\n\nI got the broccoli and beef, this dish had quality in it. The beef tasted like beef and not just some rubbery mixed in substituted meat, it was authentic food. The broccoli wasn't soft or soggy and had the perfect crisp to it. Not too salty at all with the right amount of sweetness. I like how they made the brown rice, it wasn't sticky at all and it was just good. Definitely will try their Mozheto (Mojito) next time.. I think i'm starting to love that drink.\n\nThe lighting was perfect, not to bright or dark. The food was worth it's weight in gold. Way better than your typical fast food chain. There was a lot I wanted to try so i'll definitely be back for more, whether it be in Las Vegas, L.A. or San Diego. It was great eating here."

Not to mention easy on the eyes. As I looked at my menu I was sad to see they removed Dan Dan noodles. One of my favorite. My server said we can make them for you still. Made me happy. I always have left overs so before you judge. I take a lot home. Tomorrows lunch is going to be awesome!\n\n I ordered egg rolls which were blah. The rolls weren't fresh and I can tell because normally I have to cut them in half to cool because they are steaming hot. This time they were barely warm and the sauce had a strong mustard flavor and sent. I do not recommend the egg rolls. 0/5 I would have sent them back but I was starving and I learned a long time ago never send food back unless it's under cooked. Then I ordered the Chang's spicy chicken substitute shrimp. So delicious. If you always get the Chang's chicken try it with shrimp. The shrimp is a game changer! It has a slight crispiness to it.  Comes with rice I always choose Brown rice. 5/5   Also I got my Dan Dan noodles. So good. Romen noodles with diced up chicken a Brown sauce, bean sprouts and shreds of cucumber. 5/5\n\nBecause of my amazing service and all the great shrimp and noodles that weren't on the menu  I am giving them 5/5 stars just don't order the egg rolls."

But luckily, this time that was not the case.\n\nCame here for the happy hour menu at 5 PM. Got seated very quickly and perused the menu for a moment. Our waitress was very nice and was good at explaining what exactly was in the dishes so I could make sure what I was ordering was vegetarian (some vegetarian items on the menu do not have the symbol next to them, I think because of egg ingredients). I ended up ordering the vegetarian lettuce wraps for $5, veggie spring rolls for $3, and crispy green beans for $4, and also a red velvet cake sweet shot for $2. Everything came out very quickly and it was delicious. I had never had the green bean fries before and they were insanely good. Green beans fried lightly in a light, crunchy batter with a mayo-based sauce that totally kicks the shit out of your tastebuds, because at first it's nice and tasty and then BAM! SPICY! But these things are crazy addictive and the price was very nice. \n\nWhat is even nicer is that I am a Warrior card member, which gives me 10% off everything, including Happy Hour prices (only until June 31st, however). A great deal for a great meal of appetizers. Our drinks were filled consistently, and the server even boxed up my food for me at the table, and brought out extra fry sauce for me to take home. This was an exceptionally nice visit and I am always glad to come here, even though my fortune cookie (wisely) told me to be frugal. Guess Happy Hour fit that bill!"

Literally my only complaint could be that the food took too long. It could be, but it won't be. Because when it was taking too long the waiter brought us a free appetizer, a delicious vegetarian lettuce wrap. Then they offered us a free dessert of our choice. I had ordered the chicken sate because that's what I get from everywhere. The chicken was so delicious but the peanut sauce was the best I have ever tasted, nothing else has even come close! I was licking the bowl and wishing it was twice as big. The only thing that I was disappointed by was every time I get this it comes with a cucumber salad and this one came with a regular tiny salad. It's a little pricey but we more than made up for it in free food and even without it it would have been worth it."

This one in particular was more brightly lit on the inside compared to some I've been to in the past.\n\nThe server we had was AWESOME, his name was Melique and I hope I spelled his name correctly.  He deserves an award.

Buddha's Delight. Brown rice and steamed vegeys. Nothing else added. Exactly what I needed and was looking for. Healthiest (for me) meal yet. My buds enjoyed their meals and I enjoyed mine.

I told him to go away and he looked at me with a glare. The four of us had two different noodle dishes, but the sauce in each was exactly the same and way too much of it.

Chang's often has a long wait, but I find it worth it for some of the best vegetarian fried dumplings in the world.  The spring rolls are not so great, so skip them, but sampling most anything else should prove tasty.  They offer a good selection of vegetarian dishes, filling salads, and several other entrees that would get dubbed \"California Chinese\".

Another reason is the parking lot. Being near the Strip there is a lot of foot traffic that walks around this P.F. Chang's and through the parking lot. I had a gift card and since hubby and I were nearby this location we decided to pick up some food to-go for dinner. After pulling in and finding a spot to park, we both opened our car doors to get out and 2 females quickly approached both sides of our car and asked for money and or cigarettes. There was also a guy in a wheelchair that I saw on the way inside who was holding a sign asking for money. Given the popularity of this location even after all of these years, I would think P.F. Chang's would have a security guard outside to help keep the customers who are patronizing the business safe or at least feel that way. \n\nKung Pao Chicken Jicama Street Tacos ($7.50) - Chicken that is wok-tossed in chili sauce with Fresno peppers and chopped peanuts accompanied by cucumbers. You get jicama shells to stuff the deliciousness in and the menu says it comes with 3 per order, but honestly they have always given me about 4 or 5 at any location I have ordered them from. Make sure if you are ordering to-go that you request the jicama shells be put on top of the chicken or in a separate container so they don't get soggy. The cucumber is put on the side since it's cold and I personally love the fresh taste it adds to the chicken, but it can be left off if that isn't your thing. I get this almost every time and am so glad they added it to the menu and hope it stays because it's so tasty!\n\nChang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($9.25) - Chicken, mushrooms, green onion and water chestnuts make up this dish that has been a popular favorite by many for years. Oh, yes it also comes with those crispy rice sticks, but I don't like those and request they be left out. They forgot this last time and it wasn't underneath the chicken thank goodness, so eating around it wasn't an issue. I always ask for extra lettuce cups and they are added at no additional charge. The chicken lettuce wraps are something my hubby and I both really enjoy and the portion of chicken is generous which is why extra lettuce cups are needed. The lettuce is put in a plastic baggie so the stay cold, crisp, fresh and ready to be filled with that chicken goodness. \n\nChicken Fried Rice ($9.75) - This is supposed to have rice tossed in soy sauce with egg, carrots, bean sprouts and scallions. I requested the bean sprouts be left out and they wasn't the only thing that ended up being missing from the dish. The rice wasn't tossed all the way through with the soy sauce, some of the rice was crunchy, the carrots were sliced bigger than usual and off to the side instead of tossed with the rice and there were no scallions. Some of the egg was overcooked. There was maybe 4 pieces of chicken in the rice and I paid more to have meat in the dish (the veggie rice is cheaper). The rice was a major fail.\n\nChicken Lo Mein ($10.50) - Noodles tossed in soy sauce with chicken. This dish usually comes tossed with veggies, but I prefer my noodles \"plain\" which just means noodles and sauce without the rabbit food. The noddles were delicious and at first I wondered where the chicken was and then after giving the noddles a toss with my fork I was pleased with the amount that was under the noodles. Much different than I experienced with the fried rice! \n\nChocolate Raspberry and Sweet Vanilla Cream Wontons (2 for $3.50) - Chocolate and raspberry filling inside a wonton that is dusted in powdered sugar on one side makes for one tasty treat! I wish the wonton wasn't overcooked a tad, but the chocolate and raspberry filling was very good! You get some fresh raspberries on the side and one each of chocolate and raspberry sauces. Dip your wonton in both it's good! The inside of the vanilla cream was supposed to have a vanilla cream cheese flavor and if they meant vanilla = bland they sure accomplished that. The wonton was way overdone and crispy and the filling really lacked flavor. The chocolate and raspberry wontons were much better and the perfect small bites after eating a big meal for dessert. \nTake a look around."

We started with our drinks and Lettuce Wraps and they were fresh and tasty. Our meals of Peppered Steak and Almond Cashew Chicken was gorgeously presented and the taste was quite yummy. The cute desserts were  yummy so all in all it was a great time."

I was expecting yummy sauce over the stir fried vegetables, instead it was just a plain plate full of steamed vegetables, broccoli, snow peas, asparagus and carrots. I had to put my own soy sauce and other sauce to make it tasty. It wasn't bad, but the menu was misleading which I didn't like. It should have been noted that the gluten free dish was going to be steamed vegetables.  \n\nKind of disappointing..."

The decor is nicer than most chain restaurants and the food is slightly above average quality wise. My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and the beef and broccoli and both were relativity good. The portions are huge so be aware of that before you order. Most of their menu items are easily shareable. However, our waitstaff was slightly below great. We ordered white and brown rice, only to have 2 brown rices delivered. The waiter then informed us that he will bring the white rice, only to be seemingly forgotten. All in all, the restaurant was comparable to the Cheesecake Factory in every sense, with less than comparable service. Three stars."

I said it..! \nThat being said, they have some of the best in the city, not too greasy like other spots and not too salty.. They also manage to hide water chestnuts in there which I hate but they found a way to make them tasty... Technically I could give them 5 stars. For what I typically like to eat from \"chinese\" restaurants they fill me up and have some tasty dishes but the 3 star ratings comes from their inability to substitute fried rice! \nYeah.. Big annoyance for me, it literally makes me angry to think about my inability to eat fried rice with my dinner without having to order a $ 10 meal size portion of fried rice. I'm unsure if this is location specific b/c I have had fried rice subbed at the Summerlin location but I guess on the strip they live by strip rules.. I had to deal with it.. but I wasnt happy ! and clearly from this post... I'm still not happy about it..!"

My 4 stars are for my experience that evening and happy hour.\n\nWe went for their happy hour and definitely ordered way too much food! We were starving. We started with a cup of soup each, not on the happy hour menu but It was only 3.95 for a cup. I had the won ton and he had the hot and sour. We really enjoyed them. I like the fact that the soup came out piping hot. I hate, I mean I really hate when I get a lukewarm soup!!\n\n Off the happy hour menu we ordered Lettuce wraps of course, always refreshing. My husband really liked their steamed dumplings, we ordered pork and shrimp. Shrimp was my favorite. I really loved the dynamite shrimp, I think it was my favorite!  They were too spicy for my Andrew, I found them perfectly delicious! We also got egg rolls which were good, not great. The spare ribs I really liked and my 6 year old thought they were yummy (we ended bringing her food home, like I said way too much food) but my husband doesn't like star anise much and you can really taste it in the ribs. FYI, we had the wet ones not the five spice rubbed. Lastly, we got crab won tons. I like the filling, slightly sweet, cream cheesy and a hint of crab. The dipping sauce that came with them is pretty good, too.\n\nTo drink I got the Chinese 88 Martini but opted Bombay Sapphire instead of Plymouth. They let you do that free of charge. I really liked it. I asked my bartender not to make it too sweet. She was great and attentive and so was the bar back. So we were happy with service.  My husband had the Asian Pear Mojito and he really liked it as well.  He then had a Grey Goose on the rocks, not on happy hour but for roughly 11.00 it was a really hefty pour and we appreciate that!\n\nAll and all we enjoyed our meal. Such a great happy hour!"

When I got inside I told the hostess there was a woman loitering. \n\nWhen my dad and I left, I had him wait for me, and I looked in the parking lot to be on the safe side and there was no one around.\n\nI was about a foot away from my car and a man appeared from no where and was a about 6 feet in front of me. I quickly got in my car and locked the doors and he was yelling and screaming absurd things to me. \n\nI picked up my dad, rushed him into my car, warned the folks getting out of their car and snapped a photo of him. \n\n I called the restaurant and spoke to the MGR and told him about both incidents.

I was so disappointed :( never coming back to this location.  60 dollars gone and a bad taste in my mouth.

The beef was very salty and I found myself drinking a lot more water the rest of the day to combat the thirsty feeling I had all afternoon.  This place is exactly how I remembered it: a decent choice for a meal that is in the mid-price range.  You won't get standout food, but you probably won't die of any diseases either!

Heading out to California, we just made the dining room with less than half an hour to spare before closing time, and were the last diners sitting.  So, we closed the place, which I learned can have some nice advantages--like all the cups of Hot & Sour Soup you want, and larger food portions than normal.  It's a choice inside the kitchen between discarding extra food or giving it to remaining diners.\n\nSo, Diane and I very much enjoyed sipping fragrant Ginger Peach Tea in dainty white teacups as we worked our way through our Four-Course Prix-Fixe meals.  The Hot & Sour Soup with strips of pork was hot and great.  I was willing to pay extra for more, but didn't have to.  \n\nSalt & Pepper Calamari Strips resting on a bed of hard white Rice Noodles were good but a bit hard themselves.  The spicy Bean Sauce that accompanied this appetizer was tasty, and, surprisingly, so were the Rice Noodles.\n\nThen, while Diane savored her Crispy Honey Shrimp, which was sweet and succulent (when I report on the taste of a dish, I have always sampled it myself, rather than just adopting a fellow diner's words--even a wife's), I delighted in the really meaty and chewy Pepper Steak that was served with more fluffy Steamed White Rice than we could handle.  But the viscous, flavorful sauce got really spicy at the end of the meal.  It's a wonder we got to our home in southern California without a rest stop!\n\nWe finished with two mini-desserts.  My Triple Chocolate Mousse Mini Dessert  featured three different types of delicious chocolate mousse poured and set in distinct vertical layers, and was simply great.  It was fun to dig to a new level, and soon afterward be greeted by a fresh chocolatey taste sensation.  Our spacious booth was comfortable, and our server, Michael, was very accommodating and proactive through the entire duration of our late dinner.  Filled water glass replacements showed up ahead of need.  Even the music had a nice beat to it.  And the tab for food for two was under $40--a great deal!  So, we walked out happy. \n\n4-1/2 stars overall!"

They started off by giving us a refreshing dragon oolong tea. Not the biggest fan of oolong but it was a unique blend of sweetness and a mild leafy taste. Try it, it surely impressed me. The atmosphere feels classy with the dim lighting, rounded seating and marble-like flooring. The food was satisfying but not without its flaws. Many of the dishes were salty, especially the soup. After a few spoonfuls I couldn't even finish it. The kung pao chicken was so salty it's hard to eat after a few pieces. The honey shrimp was obviously not salty and sweet rather, as it should be :) Thankfully the shrimp made up for the meal but I had to mentally make a note for less salt next time. Other than that, this place is definitely worth a visit!"

The hostess was on the phone at the front door  and when she finished her call, wiped her nose with her hand and proceed to take us to a table and placed the menu's down.  Mind you this was in the middle of the flu season and she did not use a tissue or wash her hands.  She then proceeded to pick up the extra place settings and stack them on a shelf close to our table.  Within a few minutes a waiter came by and I asked to see the manager, which he obliged.  I told the manger what happen and it appeared he could care less as he did not take the plates off the shelf and into the kitchen.  Shortly thereafter another waited came by and picked up the plates and took them to another table.  I wonder how many germs were on the plates?   Who got the flu from this untrained hostess?   Very poor management at a great chain.  I will think twice before I go back to this location.  Great food, but untrained in personal hygiene.  Watch out!!!"

She put me right behind of the order machine (which I wasn't aware of at that time) where every waiter or waitress took their orders would go behind me to enter those orders.  Worst place to sit in the house!\nMy server was okay, he wasn't very helpful when I asked a few questions.  First I asked about what type of hot tea is good for sore throat (from cold), no specific answer was given, fine!  So I ordered a tropical green tea, not bad.\nThen I started with a cup of wonton soup, but I tried to change my order for a bowl instead of cup after 10 seconds of my order, he said too late, the order has been entered (the machine just right behind of me, ding2x).  I felt like it was quite rude to say that..., sure there's a way to revise.  My vibe was going down south from that point.\nAfter glancing at the menu, I decided shrimp candied walnut based on one of the yelp review.  Then he asked if I want a lunch portion that came with soup or salad, or dinner (he only gave me a dinner menu).  Well..., if I knew it did come with soup, I may not order the wonton soup in the first place, since I'm not a salad person.  I ended up with a dinner portion.  I wasn't impressed with the meal, it was a cold creamy dish.  The white rice was dried, tasted like overnight rice.  Had a few bites, decided to take it home.  Since the place was getting busy, all the entire of orders just came straight behind me!!  Very annoying!!!  The manager came by and asked if everything was okay, I didn't want to make a scene out of it, so I was politely said okay.  All of these happened, I still gave 18-20% tip, but I won't be back again..., thanks to the hostess, service & disappointed food."

Chang's is like taking an introductory class in Chinese food.  For those that don't know authentic Chinese or asian food, this place is a great start for new palates.  It doesn't try to be authentic so you shouldn't go in assuming to have true home cooked meals here.  \n\nThe focus for them is clean \"up-scale\" atmosphere and consistent dishes across all their restaurants so that people from the mid-west  (or where ever people live that have never tried Asian cuisine) can feel comfortable and get a great meal.   Then when a restaurant pops up in Cheyenne WY or Troy, Mich., you have instant success (just an example)... I've been to other PF's and this one still surpasses others in flavor, but for those of you that know authentic food, this still doesn't stack up.  \n\nI give it three for those that are looking to dabble in new things Chinese and get a familiarity to some of the tastes and styles, then once their \"feet are wet\" start getting adventurous... in no time you'll be asking for sea cucumber and birds nest soup (well maybe not that adventurous ;)"

Its always great prices...yummy food and casual atmosphere. Not a fan of the paradise location due to it being so ghetto in that area but hey it could be worse. Its usually hit and miss when it comes to servers. I almost gave 4 stars for that fact but because I love their food and atmosphere so much I just couldnt give 4 stars. But they definitely need to keep an eye on their servers they lack in customer service skills and not very intuitive. You get such big portions here for such an awesome price. For all that you order you would think it would be more but the bill always comes back to be so low even after ordering apps, entrees and dessert. Yum to pf changs...i always highly recommend this place!"

I'm not so lazy that I can't walk the 50 yards from my car to the door.\n\nThe hostess had a look on her face that seemed to say we were interrupting her day.  She was not even remotely cordial.  I didn't catch her name.  The table was clean.\n\nOur waitress was the highlight of the whole experience.  She was friendly, \"got\" my boss's weird sense of humor, and never approached the table with questions while we were chewing, though she did interrupt a conversation twice to joke with us.\n\nWe ordered egg rolls to start.  When they came out, there was oil from the fryer literally pooled on the plate under them.  When we bit into them, they were still cold on the inside.  Ugh!  Cold, greasy eggrolls!  The waitress apologized, told the manager, and we were sent out another order.  These were still really greasy, but at least they were warmer inside, though still not really hot.  The manager didn't show up at the table, which in my opinion a manager should ALWAYS show up if there's a problem with the food.\n\nThe boss ordered Mongolian Beef, and I got Sichuan Scallops.  He said his entree was what he expected, but nothing to rave about.  My scallops were very tender, and just the right level of spicy.  The servings of rice with the entrees were inadequate.\n\nThe waitress was really on top of soda refills, and was very quick with the check.  She got a nice tip (25%) but we suggested they put their cooks through a retraining course.  \n\nTypical of what I expect from large chain \"Chinese\"restaurants."

My other friend ordered fried rice, which I didn't try because I prefer white rice. Didn't look like anything special, just filler for the mid-section. PFC does offer brown rice as well. \nMy friend is Asian (Korean) which surprised me, because most Chinese don't eat fried rice at all, or if they do, they are just making something out of leftover rice and other dishes at home. I thought only non-Asians ordered fried rice in the restaurant? Well, I take it back, at Panda's I order half noodles, half fried rice, because it ir right there in front! \n\nOnce again, if you like poorly represented Chinese food in a well decorated environment with a lot of other non-Chinese, and want to pay more for it, this is the place America loves! \n\nIt still cracks me up when the waitress asks us if we need help \"mixing\" the sauces for us!

Lettuce Wraps, Orange Chicken etc.  Not everything but enough choices to make it worth it.  \n\nYou start with soup, we upgrade to the Wonton for some yummy starts.  Then you get 1 appetizer (Lettuce Wraps are a staple.) 2 entrees and either 3 mini deserts or one large piece of cake for a slight upgrade price.\n\nThe bowl of soup is huge and we have always ended up taking some home.  The portions appear the same size as the regular dining and of course the same great taste.  The Mongolian Beef is one of our favorites and the Crispy Honey Shrimp and Chicken are awesome.\n\nUnless you are super hungry, there will be enough leftovers for 1-2 lunches.  Make yourself the envy of your lunch crowd at work by enjoying a chinese feast the next day.\n\nI have now become a fan of PF Changs and give them a resounding Xie xie or M goi.  Not to mention the service was fantastic.  We had an amazing server who has been there 7 years.  I hope the restaurant appreciates what they have in this girl.\n\nThe only think keeping this from a 5 star rating is that I am from the East Coast where corner store chinese food is better than anything you can find in Vegas and half the price."

They knew we were first-timers and treated us like gold.  Their food recommendations were great.  The candied walnut shrimp is the best I have ever had.  Fantastic.  For the same price as Chiles or Applebees this place has far better food, far better atmosphere, and far better service."

Where else can you go and for 2 people get soup, appetizer, 2 entrees, rice and dessert for $39. That is a 4 course meal.  Am I missing something here? This is a damn steal! If you think that is \"overpriced\" then go to Chili's or Applebees and eat that garbage! PF Changs has amazing Asian cuisine that is superb, full of flavor and well worth the price. We had very fast and courteous service last night as well, and every time I have ever went I have never had any issues with the service. \n\nMy fave dishes/apps are Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao Chicken and Orange chicken, Lettuce wraps and Chicken chow mein. I haven't tried everything so I am sure there is more awesomeness to eat there as well. I do not eat fish so can't really speak on that.\n\nIf you want to upgrade your dessert for $1.95, Try the Banana spring rolls. Its fried banana with pineapple coconut ice cream with vanilla and caramel sauce and fruit! Amazing! I love PF Changs. Cant wait to eat my leftovers for lunch today."

Chang's, and I must say I've been pretty resistant in the past.\n\nWe had a gift card that we had to use up, so we figure we're in the Summerlin area and we may as well grab lunch.  There was easily no wait on a weekend afternoon, although we were told all the outside tables were taken.\n\nThey had about 9 offerings of lunch bowls that are served daily until 4 pm that include your entree being served on a bed of rice, and a cup of either Egg Drop or Hot & Sour soup.\n\nThey bring to your table a bunch of dipping sauces, about six of them that include soy sauce, hot chili sauce, vinegar, hot yellow mustard, hot chili oil, and one other thing.\n\nMy choice: \n* Egg Drop Soup \"A classic starter\" - It was piping hot when it arrived and with a bit of heat added to it, it wasn't too bad.  I was starving and drank it all up.  It was a bit darker than what I expected it to be though.\n\n* Buddha's Feast \"Veggies with five-spice tofu served steamed or stir-fried\" - I liked the fact that you can have brown or white rice, which is a nice perk you don't typically find at Chinese restaurants, but then again, this isn't your typical Chinese restaurant.  It's a generous portion for one, and I like their choice of veggies.  It had broccoli, asparagus, snap peas, mushrooms, carrots, and tofu all in my dish.  So, it's definitely a hearty dose of the good green veggies.  I definitely needed to add some heat to my dish and eventually added enough chili oil that my rice was swimming in it.\n\nThe Husband had: \n* Hot & Soup \"Either by the cup or bowl, this will warm your soul\" - I guess it was okay, and he did drink it up.  I don't ever order this, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like.\n\n* Sesame Chicken \"Back by popular demand...love the ginger, chili paste and garlic\" - He asked the waiter if they could make it extra spicy, which he said of course too.  Except that when the order arrived, the Husband said it tasted like they didn't put any hot spices in there.  He wasn't particularly fond of the sauce of the dish, but beyond the chicken was onions, broccoli, and bell peppers with black sesame seeds tossed in there.\n\nThey were offering 'mini' desserts that arrived in shot classes, which was a sampling for about $2/each.  We went for two kinds:\n\n* S'mores - The Husband thought this was too sweet for him, and it really was crushed graham crackers, a very sweet marshmallow creme, and chocolate sauce.\n\n* Strawberry Cheesecake - The Husband enjoyed this more, and all it really consisted of was crushed graham crackers, strawberry preserves, and white cream.  \n\n(They reminded me of something you could easily do at home, but I guess it satisfies your sweet tooth with having to purchase one of their bigger desserts.)\n\nOverall, the food was decent, and the portions were pretty generous for the price.  It'd be different to go for dinner and do family style though.  We noticed mostly everyone had to go boxes with them, although I found it weird how the staff would hold the to go box against their stomach and shovel the food into it.  (Sure, it works, but it looks not so nice.)\n\nSide note: They offer a chef's table that allows you to eat inside the kitchen as you can watch them cook.  Pretty cool!"

It's been a few months that we've eaten here so we decided to take out dinner on our last visit it's a shame to say it was the WORST It was about an hour before closing that We had ordered our food for take out, we ordered the Chicken lettuce wraps , Crispy green beans , Changs spicy chicken, and an order of chicken and egg fried rice with no veggies (made that very clear)  ..... What we got? I honestly couldn't even tell you. We live no more then 5 minutes from this place they told us about 25 min it would be ready , when we open our food the green beans were cold and soggy like they picked them off someone's plate that left an hour ago the rice was hard and stuck together like it's been under the heat lamp with vegetables in it no taste what so ever. The changs spicy chicken was bland and the lettuce wraps lets just say I'm not ordering them any more! We called after our pick up and spoke to Erin the manager I told her I will gladly bring the food back we didn't even really touch anything . she apologized and because their kitchen was unfortunately closing and the restaurant was closing as well she could refund our money back onto a Pf Changs gift card ... I was very appreciative but that's not a chance I want to even take going back. So we had picked up a Thai chicken salad from tropical smoothie that was 10x better then what we were served! Beyond disappointed 50$ sitting on a card we most likely won't use."

I had wonton soup, steamed pork dumplings, and the chopped chicken salad. You get a choice of dressing with the salad - ginger or sesame. I had the sesame and it was to die for! I am going to check whether they sell this by the jar, and if so, I'll definitely buy some. The food wasn't anything amazing (I thought it was the same quality you get at any generic Chinese place), but perfectly fine.\n\nI probably wouldn't go back and eat in the actual restaurant, just because of the generic chain feel of the place.

I honestly didn't like the food when I tried it years ago for the first time. Then I discovered that at this restaurant, you really have to order different dishes on every visit to break down what you like and don't like. My favorites are the Crispy Honey Chicken and the Mongolian Beef. Shockingly, I don't eat green beans, but I do like the Crispy Green Beans appetizer. Everything is better when fried! Also, brown rice is an option without an extra charge, yay!\n\nAs I mentioned, service is slow. If you plan to dine in, be prepared to stay for like an hour and a half. If you need to get in and out quick, you MIGHT have better luck with take out/curbside pickup. Remember, I said MIGHT. This location can get pretty crowded for dinner on a weekday. We came here during the middle of the week. The parking lot was packed and although there were many people waiting to get a table, we were seated within a few minutes.\n\nWhat really annoyed me was my last visit. I called in my order for curbside pickup. 30 minutes later, I parked in one of the curbside parking stalls. I waited about 5 minutes before an employee ran to my car. She greeted me, repeated my order back to me, I confirmed it, and gave her my debit card. A few minutes later, I got my food and started to drive back home. As I was at a red light, I peeked in the brown paper bag and noticed that they forgot to give me my 2 boxes of white rice. Grrr! Pulled a U-Turn and drove back. Luckily, I wasn't too far away at the time. When I got there, I didn't see any employees in the curbside area, so I called the restaurant. Hey, they are the ones that forgot my rice, so I wasn't going to get out of my car! The first person I talked to transferred me to the hostess. The hostess then transferred me to take out. Then take out transferred me to curbside. WTF? I told the last guy on the phone that I was missing my 2 boxes of white rice, I drove back and was parked in a curbside stall and asked if someone could run it to my car. He said \"Let me see what my manager can do for you\" and put me on hold. A few minutes later, dial tone. Really?? Right when that happened, the curbside employee who helped me earlier came to my window and said \"Was something wrong, ma'am?\" I told her I was missing my rice, she apologized, and  finally gave it to me. \n\nLesson learned. Always check your bag before you leave. But still. This isn't McDonalds for crying out loud! Its their job to make sure all the orders are correct! I did call back later that night to speak with a manager about how unorganized they were and how much of my time they wasted because they couldn't do something simple as double checking the orders. She apologized and did send me a $10 gift card in the mail, which was nice of her. I do like the food here so I will be back. Hopefully things will run more smoothly the next time around."

Tender pork ribs, marinated for hours, cooked to perfection in a tangy sauce, and served with a little ramekin of Chinese 5-spice blend.  Pinch a little atop -- munch, munch, munch.  It's pure love.  In fact, it was this location on RAMPART that I first held and caressed these ribs, and it's very memorable.\n\nOrder \"off the menu\":\n-- The \"real\" Ginger Beer; usually made with Kirin beer and ginger syrup has been replaced with a non-alcoholic one on the menu.  I have them make it with bud light to save a few calories, and still -- so good.\n-- The \"Stir-fried Eggplant\" is awesome.  Except they no longer carry it with the minced chicken, only listed with the veggies.  Voila!  Available on request.  Yay!\n\nI took some photos of the ribs and eggplant, and eek - doesn't look so good up-close, so scratch the upload.  Regardless, with the trinity of PF Chang sauces, I slather it all about everything I order...always great.  Like George, I like it HOT and SPICY.\n\nNo matter what you order, you get quality -- not authentic, but it is what it is.  Whether you get a Chinese Chicken Salad (adore), Sweet & Sour Soup, or the Lemon Chicken -- it's consistently good.\n\n==================================\nLocation specific - Rampart Blvd, Las Vegas\n==================================\n\n1.

When I can cancelled the order she then stole my points off my card as if I received the free meal. This is the short version of what happened but the basics. I believe she just didn't want my kind to get the free meals and it was apparent by her choice of words and temperament.

Everything here is awesome, and there are some sushi choices for those of you who prefer to eat nearly living things. Haven't had the nerve to try their tacos yet. I do have one beef. They used to give you complimentary fried wonton noodles and three delish dipping sauces. Suddenly, they just stopped. There was no warning, no rhyme, and no reason. There's no message on the tables and nothing mentioned in the menu. You can still get it if you ask for it, but I think that's an underhanded way of cutting costs or time spent at a table."

The Korean bbq was a first for me. I would definitely order it again. The only real complaint I have is the cleanliness of the table we were seated at. The soy sauce bottle was stuck to the table. I tried with some force to free the bottle with no success. We both laughed about it and I gave it a quick karate chop to free it from the table. There was quite a ring of stickiness left on the table once the bottle had been displaced.  Overall very pleased with the meal and the service!

Of course, that's not saying a whole lot.\n\nThe one item on the menu really worthy of praise is the Oolong marinated Sea Bass. When prepared properly it's delicious, but even this dish can be hit or miss. The first few times I tried it the fish was perfectly seared, crispy on the outside and buttery soft in the center. The last time I ordered the Sea Bass, it tasted so different... almost like it was steamed instead of seared. Not crisp, just sort of mushy. \n\nThe rest of the menu items I have tried have just been alright, not bad but not great. Lettuce wraps were a bit bland, spare ribs were rubbery, egg rolls were mediocre.\n\nThe servers mixing up their own style of sauce can be fun, the new mini desserts are a nice touch, there's a full bar. The Vietnamese crab salad is good, I think it is a seasonal irem.\n\nOverall there are just so many better, authentic options in Vegas.  My advice, get out and explore."

Last time I tried couple different dishes & they weren't very good such as shrimps in lobster sauce. So I better stick to what I like. Lol! I also like that kids have healthy choices rather than just chicken fingers, mac & cheese, etc. at most of the restaurants."

The wait for me in the past has been up to a 2 hour wait so I always call ahead of time to make sure I wont have to wait too long when getting there. Parking is another thing the lot can be pretty full at times but, when people know where good food is they tend to gather!\n\nWe like getting the \"Four-Course Meal For Two For $39.99\". You get your choice of 2 soups, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 small desserts. For $1.95-$3.95 you can upgrade to 1 larger dessert but for us we like choosing our own smaller ones that are included in the price already. \n\nI love their \"Egg Drop Soup\". It is some of the best I have ever had. I usually always start out with \"Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps\". The lettuce is always so fresh and crisp and the chicken tastes so darn good. I just can't get enough of the lettuce wraps! We also got \"Pork Fried Dumplings\". These are chocked full of delicious flavored pork. If you like dumplings then these are a must and they have veggie too. For my main meal I usually get \"Crispy Honey Chicken\". The chicken comes with crispy rice sticks under the chicken and u tell them to leave that off so I can mix my white rice with the chicken, yum! For the dessert menu I would eat one of everything it all sounds good! The dessert I did choose this time was \"Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake\". Sounds good right? It was just so-so. I wasn't upset at all it was perfectly edible the flavor just didn't add up to the name so I will try a different one next time.\n\nI had a \"Strawberry Daiquiri\" that was $6.50 and delicious.\n\nThere is a outdoor patio if you want to eat outside.\n\nCheck out their website. They have a \"Warrior Rewards\" that gives you freebies from time to time. Just for signing up you get a free order of lettuce wraps!"

Delicious, we all went home full to the ears with just enough left over for great an evening snack.\n\nAs we were first timers at P.F. Chang's, we relied on our waiter for some recommendations and he was spot on.  Unfortunately, we can't remember his name, but he was very warm and friendly and attentive to all our needs.\n\nWe will definitely be back to P.F. Chang's.

I usually get the Chang's Chicken (highly recommended) and the Mongolian Beef.  Too bad they discontinued the Lemon Pepper Shrimp, which was awesome.  The down sides are that there is often a long wait to get seated, over an hour at peak dinner hour, and the price is higher than most Chinese food.  But other people have had poor experiences there.  They do have some dishes that are not that great, and if that was all I had ever ordered there, I would certainly give them a worse rating.  I do not recommend their salads, for example.  Service is usually very good, and they have a full bar for most any trendy cocktail you might want."

The lay out was pretty much as i had remembered it.  The service was friendly and hardly overwhelmed.

They were tasty.\n\nThe GF had a the combo lo mein.  It was tasty.\n\nI had my honey shrimp.  It was also tasty.\n\nOver the years it seems the price has remained the same but the portions have become smaller.\n\nWith my craving satisfied and partaking in an A-OK experience, it could be a few more years before I return again."

I tried it a few times more to see if I could find something that I could stand to eat without wanting to spit it out in to my napkin with no success, even the lettuce wraps and dumplings were just awful. So I guess what I have to say is if you liked the great food at P.F. Chang's you are out of luck it has gone the way of the Dodo bird. I wish I could give it minus stars and it would be - 10. Sure do miss the awesome food they built their reputation on."

Not the cheapest but we get quality food and that's what we appreciate. \n\nSitting in take out my car battery died. Crapola, just my luck. No jumper cables. So I called a near by yelp friend.. Shout out to Liz R! Anyway, her cables were too short and of course to remedy that problem we would have to ask a pf change customer to stop eating and move their car, no thanks, that's rude and I would never interrupt their meal for my convince. The take out lady was nice enough to bring my daughter a drink, bring me her jumper cables from her car and help us start it. For some reason it still wasn't working, just clicking. She asked her manager to come out and have a look. He did, or well I thought it was the manager, he never gave us his name. Long story short he wiggled stuff around, gassed it a bit. And boom it worked. By the time I got home my food was luckily still warm, \n\nThumbs up to pf changs for the amazing help, I would have been stuck without you because AAA wait time was one hour and my husband was 40 minutes away."

She looked down for the rest of the conversation and said, \"K, this table here okay\" And points to the first booth closest to the host stand. We said sure, it was a nice table. \"K. Sit and I'll bring your menus in a sec\". We sat and a minute later, she brings our menus while looking at the bar area the whole time and walked away without saying a word. No \"enjoy your meal\", no \"enjoy\", nothing. Throughout our meal, she walked across our table talking loudly to the other employees, and once even yelling across the room to say something to a server right in front of our table. I didn't see a single smile or politeness from her to us or any other guests. \n\nI don't write reviews about the host stand because that doesn't make or break an experience for me, but she was so unprofessional and rude that I'm sorry, I was disgusted. \n\nTwo stars for the always satisfying, good food and for Luis, our very friendly and professional server."

We only ate a little bit at the restaurant because we didn't like any of our dishes and packed most of it for home...got my surprise when I ate my fried rice the next day.\n\nFirst of all-If people think that going here would call itself as 'having Chinese food'. It could be farther fetched. It is Chinese-fusion at best...but that isn't even good.\n\nFood dishes were ok. Not really any Asian flare, besides using some Asian vegetables. we had the lemon chicken, crab wontons, beef and broccoli and beef fried rice. All were just blah- the lower end Chinese take-out places are tastier than this. To top if off my fried rice had a quarter size egg shell in it...if it was like a 1/4inch piece...ok shit. An happen. But that thing was a size of a quarter...can't fish that out???? How did you not notice it fell in it.\n\nOnly 1 star for ambience. Interior is nice, semi circular bar is ok. But overall I will not go back here no recommend this place. I can get better Chinese food at China-a-go-go....and that means a lot. For the same  value at PF Chang I could get like twice the items and at least have more flavorful food. If you want to eat Chinese, go to Chinatown. Otherwise-don't waste your time dressing up and have some blah fusion food."

As soon as we got to the hostess stand, who never smiled, she seemed annoyed that a larger group was asking for a table of 7.  She scoffed about having to put two tables together.  Then, when we left, she did not say \"bye\" or \"thank you.\"  Still had the same scowl on her face.  The service was ok in between the hostess's awful attitude.  And, the place does have some good lunch prices.  But, my entire group was turned off from the horrible hospitality, or lack thereof.

Chang's another chance.\n\nFOOD\n+Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps: Rice Noodles (menu claims these are \"rice sticks\") topped with chicken, mushrooms, and cashews. Flavor was lacking, and I bit into a hard \"rice stick\". I passed on a second helping.\n\n+Mongolian Beef: Much sweeter than other versions I've eaten. The sweetness is tolerable, but I would've preferred much less. \n\n+Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Sweet Treat: Tastes similar to a Snicker's bar. I was given a small spoon to eat this with, which was not the best eating utensil. The dessert was on the tough side because it had been refrigerated, but despite the minor issues the PB Crunch was delicious.\n\n+Lo Mein: Its flavor and appearance reminded me of noodles I've eaten at Panda Express.\n\nSERVICE\nExcellent.

It's literally been ages since I've been here, and the menu seems to have changed drastically from what I remember. It was happy hour at the time so we ordered a few items off their happy hour menu as well including their signature chicken lettuce wraps, Hunan dragon wings, and spicy tuna roll. I didn't have huge expectations from this place, because well, it's Americanized Chinese food, an upgraded version of Panda Express. The spicy tuna roll was not very good (rice was hard), lettuce wraps were what I remembered them to be, but the wings were pretty flavorful. I also enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and the crispy honey shrimp (which was recommended by our waitress), but other than that, all the food was saltier than the Dead Sea. Expect your blood pressure to rise sharply after eating here. \n\nDespite the mediocre food, the service was some of the best I've experienced in recent memory.

Thank you for making our dining experience much more enjoyable. \n\nI'm not sure if I'll be back here anytime soon unless I have a gift card that I need to use, but please give the waitress a raise because she was the star of the night."

Also, need to do something about their slow service. I had ordered online for a pick-up several hours in advance. I still had to wait 15-20 minutes. \n\nYou think they would at least make one of their signature dishes palatable. Wrong! Their chicken lettuce wraps was one of the worst meals I've had in Vegas!"

Their food had come out late and one of the plates was cold. The manager came over and comped some of their meal for them.  The waiter didn't introduce himself as he kept looking over at the disgruntled table.  He asked for our order and left.  The soup and lettuce wraps came out quickly, but we literally waited over an hour from the time we got there until our entrees arrived.  Once they did, some of the chicken seemed raw.  I'm pregnant, so I didn't risk eating it.  It was really stringy, slimy and chewy so I spat it out. The waiter barely spoke with us, was very awkward and inattentive. I wanted to cut him some slack and think maybe he had a rough night, but he barely even squeaked out an apology about our food being late and we were there for over 2 hours from the time we sat down at the table until the time we left. I recognize that people make mistakes, but at least own up to them and try to make it better.\n\nMy husband and I don't go out a lot, so when we do we like to make it a good experience.  Unfortunately tonight was NOT a good experience.  I think we will think twice before going back there again. :-S"

When we got the food home I couldn't believe how awful it was a the portions were barely enough. The crab won tons were burnt an the shrimp pan fried dumplings the northern style ribs were ok but not as good as when we eat in. The entree portion of Mongolian beef, honey crispy chicken were so little we could hardly share. The only entree that was a little better was the ginger chicken. It was like they had given food for maybe 1 person. It was very disappointing. I will never get take home again. Going in an eating is definitely better. Although it should be good either way"

I think the food is consistent, but extra heavy on the sodium.  Also, menu items seem to stay stagnant without changing here and then.  Finally, it seems as if the expectations for the servers have been lowered.  Do managers still visit the tables?  I think the icing on the cake was our last experience. We were DOUBLE charged on our bill, and when we called it to our server's attention he shrugged his shoulders and walked away.  Yes you heard it...no sorry, no apology, no \"have a good day.\" We were appalled.   (You better believe we will be checking our credit card statement to see if he actually credited our bill.) With that attitude, it almost felt as if we busted him in a scam. Thankfully, we compared the bill with the others who split it with us or else this might not have been caught. I hope management gets it together here and teaches basic customer service skills to their employees. That being said, I will give it another honest try at some point."

This is my first visit to the las vegas location and I was a little disappointed in the service and the food. So to start off we are waiting to be seated the hostess trys to stop one of the waitress to seat us and she mumbles something back in the lines of she is busy so the hostess starts to seat us and another waiter jumped in and seated us. It took about 10 mins before waitress came and took our drink and food order. We get our soup and i ask for the won ton strips takes almost 10 mins for that and us to get straws that we didnt get when we got our drinks. The servers says sorry about the wait on the strips were busy....now my husbamd and i look around and wonder how are they busy? Yjere was not a lot of people in the resturant at the time, maybe 7-10 at the most. After the soup and lettuce wrap which is hands down my favorite thing the resturant serves this dish is amazing the balance between the chicken and water chesnuts is perfect.  My husband got the shrimp fried rice which he enjoyed but he said it could of had a feew more shrimp in it bit overall grest dish. I ordered the pepper steak it was a little on the salty side and not hot like it just came off the stove asaid from that it was good. The desert was a fav of mine i order it from where ever serves it tiramisu, the portion wad small for it to be a shareable dessert we did the changs for 2 for 44.95 so its a good thing my husband does not eat dessert.  It took forever after i ordered it for it to come, my biggest complaint was the slow service, she told us 2 different times our food was on its way out and it never came til 15 mins after the first time she told us. Not my worst experience at a restaurant but not the best either"

We sat at the bar and it was early bout 2:00 and it was a lil busy but not overwhelming.  The bartender was sooo FREAKIN rude right from the start.  We sat there for literally 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged he would just walk right by us like we were ghosts! Not even a courtesy \"I'll be right with you\".  So were like watever right and then this couple walks in 20 mins later and sits right next to us and the same thing happenes to them, Well when the lady asked the bartender if she could just order a drink this is wat the rude bartender said \"NO not right now...I'm only one person here!!\"  I was shocked!!  And so was the lady!!  Of course I butt in and told him he shouldnt be so rude and then he just totally lost it.  I got up and went to speak with the manager but he didnt give a shit either!

Decided to overlook the poor customer service and order dinner.  This went from bad to worse, when no one came to take our order or bring us water to start.  Did I say we were right next to the order station?  The\"floor manager\" kept walking past us without even acknowledging why we were just sitting there...duh!?  He has to be pretty ignorant, lazy and clueless!  We stood up and told him we were leaving and all he said was \"ok\".  Really?  If we did eat there shouldn't he be saying thank you\" ? Never going back, I don't like clueless managers!"

Decided to get take out from here because the wait for a table was ridiculous. The place was jacked. Placed an order at their take out window and sat down at the last seat on the end of the bar, which was three deep. As crowded as it was, the bartender noticed little ol' me and asked me if I needed anything. When I said I was just waiting for a to-go order, instead of asking me to give my seat up, he gave me a free coke. \n\nGot my food (spring rolls, sesame chicken and dan dan noodles) and took it back to my room. It was fresh, perfectly seasoned and just what the hangover doctor ordered. I thought all chain restaurants were basically the same, but this location had, but far, the best food I've ever had from a PF Chang's, and i've been to about five of them all over California.\n\nIf you want really shitty PF Chang's, buried in salt with stale or undercooked rice, served by unapologetic waiters who bring you more of the same when you try to send you dish back, I recommend the one in downtown San Jose. Epically bad. How these two restaurants belong to the same company is one of life's mysteries."

Chang's before, and wanted to check it out before I left Vegas, so my bf and I had a quick bite to eat here after we checked out, and before we went to the airport.  \n\nThe restaurant was pretty full, but there was plenty of space at the bar, so we sat there.  I ordered the lettuce wraps, and my date the pork dumplings.  These were both pretty good. For entree my bf ordered the Mongolian beef, and I had the dan-dan noodles.  My bf loved his beef, but it was waay too salty for me. I was excited for my dan-dan noodles to come out because that's my favorite food at my favorite  Chinese restaurant back home, but these did NOT deliver, and I was pretty damn sad. :(  I hardly ate any of my noodles.  Sadness.\n\nIt's definitely an Americanized Chinese food place, but they have a wider selection of traditional Chinese dishes, which I appreciated.  I'll prob come back here if I'm staying at Plane Hollywood, but am going to avoid the Mongolian beef and unfortunately my beloved dan-dan noodles. :("

The service was extremely slow an disorganized (ex. Late arrival of setups, no appetizer dishes with appetizer, and entrees 45 minutes after seating).  My friend's Spicy Chicken was lukewarm and the rice cold, and my Citrus Soy Salmon was tough; all signs of food that had sat under heat lamps for too long. I suspect the restaurant's XO is not exactly on the ball about keeping large volumes of food moving quickly. \nOn the positive side, our complaints were dealt with courteously, and new entrees delivered in 7 minutes. If it weren't for this handling I would have given this experience one star."

And because Pei Wei (aka their baby cousin) taste pretty much the same, I never made my way back here. \n\nWell, my most recent visit was for a friend's wedding celebration.  Congratulations Jenny on wedding number #3.  I know we joke about it.  3 times a charm!!\n\nCouple of things to point out first;\n1.  We had the whole upper level to ourselves\n2.  The food was served buffet style\n3.  Great view of the strip from our dining area\n\nI actually liked the fact that we had the whole upstairs to ourselves.  This meant we can all enjoy the celebration without worrying about other patrons.  I knew I was eating cake later and having a couple of drinks, so I didn't take full advantage of the buffet.  I kept it to one plate.  I had their chicken lettuce wraps and their beef with broccoli.  There was a bunch of other usual's at the buffet (i.e. noodles, meins, rice, and wontons).  \n\nThe food here is always consistent. I'm still a fan of the food, just not a huge fan because the wait here always seems to take a long time.  I also spent some time at the bar catching up with friends. I had a few drinks.  The bartenders and waitresses were all efficient, at least with me.  One of my friends felt slided a little since her drinks always took forever or forgotten while mine were always right on.  All this did was just remind me about the service or lack of at the location.  But in the end, I'm not complaining because we were celebrating one of my closest friend's wedding, the food was free, and the drinks kept me happy.  \n\n\nPS:  Some of the other guests thought that the service was worth 2 stars and would have written a review if they Yelped.  While some thought it was a solid 4 stars.  I guess it comes down to the individual who's reviewing this place.  For me, I think 3 stars is just about right. \n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps and Beef w/Broccoli:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IKqfVSPfduTaIAjSDcli1A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nRum and Coke:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=38AfMKWwu7Vahz_gpDkwiQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nFortune Cookie:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=L1Dcml91sXP2wq5fRoWctQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nPF Chang's (Everyone had this):  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=AJTLbeGVFpOWlKLLzsGwgg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nWedding Cake:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RU17fdP3odQM9hC_z5A9Kg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ"

Like other PF's I've been to. They stay pretty busy so it was crowded but not packed each time. \nFOOD: Even has a vegetarian section!  However, none of the soups are vegetarian as the broths are made from meat or the soup has meat in them. Here's what I had:\n1. Buddha's Feast - sounds like something filling BUT all this is is steamed veggies, tofu, and mushroom. Doesn't even have a sauce with it..... I guess I didn't read the menu description carefully. At least I had a sauce from the sauces they give with every meal and got to experiemnt some with it.  Definitely a good healthy choice but I can get steamed whatever anywhere even a cheap chinese place. \n2. Asparagus side dish - with onion. Very good! A hint of spiciness and grilled almost to be crispy at edges. I really liked the spice on it. I wish they added a little less oil though. I wish they had this as a veggie entree mixed with tofu! I would definitely get it. \nPRICES: Expensive for what you get. Nothing impressive really. Portions are just right. I finished my entire entree which rarely happens. \nSERVICE: Even when not busy there was always a wait to be seated...both times! After being seated the service was pretty prompt and efficient. \nLOCATION: Miracle Mile shopping center - enter directly through the Planet Hollywood casino. Patio facing the strip.\nCONCLUSION: Okay, average food.... would go elsewhere in Vegas next time because I just want to try other places."

I asked her about a the fried tofu to see if it was vegan and she just said no without any explanation or suggestions of any alternatives that are vegan. One of my friends wanted to know why it wasn't vegan so i asked and she replied with \"because of the sugar.\" i looked at her confused and asked what she meant because sugar comes from sugar cane, a plant. she responded with a very condescending attitude as if i were stupid and said that the sugar came from animal bone. (Later on I looked up on my phone what she was talking about and they actually do use ingredients that are derived from bone char... gross) By this point i got really frustrated and changed my order to the buddha's feast which was truly vegan. The wait for our food was ridiculously long and i am not exaggerating because i had been drinking. My friends can also confirm that it took forever to receive our food. We were actually in a hurry to meet up with a friend to get into a club. Once the food arrived it was alright but it was literally steamed vegetables with small slices of tofu mixed in. I got bored of this very easily also. I had to order two sides of rice because steamed vegetables would not be enough for a long night of drinking and dancing..\n\nTry something else on the strip, you can get p f chang's anywhere!

So we go to a different table that at first appeared to be clean but had fortune cookie crap in the seats and tons of wrappers around me. Okay. We sit there and she wipes down the tabletop because it needs it. \n\nThen I see that the table next to us is dirty too. There are people finishing up their meal but the mess on the floor appeared to be a prior mess that was never cleaned up (most adults don't leave that type/much mess).

The beef is so tender you can't stop eating it. The drinks and beer are really good as well. I personally like the cosmopolitans. Trust me you won't be disappointed. They also have a happy hour where you can eat and drink for a great price. After you're done eating you can go right outside the doors into the Planet Hollywood Casino and have some fun.

Now I say that because we have PF Chang's at home, and there are a zillion other places that are new to try.\n\nWe had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  We waited outside in the casino area.  In the casino area, there is a window right into the kitchen.  Everyone thought it was unusually for not ONE Asian person to be working in the kitchen.\n\nOur pager went off, but when we got inside, they told us there were two people with the same name and they didn't know which one was the right person, and we would have to wait longer. After another 7-10 minutes, we were called again.\n\nWe were sat, and ordered food very quickly.\n\nEveryone's food was correct, and we all enjoyed our dinner. \n\nThere are plenty of other spots around Vegas that serve the same type of food, at less cost, and less wait.  If you are one of the people that loves to eat on the strip, then go for it, because a PF Chang's is the same throughout the country."

It was 5:30 so it hadn't started to get crowded yet.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. It was happy hour so we got a few drinks and the tuna rolls. All was great. We ordered the changs for two special and both got egg drop soup which is fabulous. We then got the chicken lettuce wraps, they never disappoint. For our dinners we shared the changs spicy chicken and kung pao scallops. Both were prepared perfectly. The amount of scallops you get is amazing and they are cooked perfect. For dessert we got the banana wontons, he said they were great, I didn't have any due to my cinnamon allergy. What a great experience, we will continue to come back."

Sitting on the patio is really what makes this place a blast on a weekend.  The people watching while having a few drinks is fun.  You have the beautiful (at least on the outside) Citycenter towering over PH.  The sidewalk going by the patio is ground zero for a lot of crazy activity, and you're pretty much guaranteed to see something interesting during dinner on a Saturday night.\n\nThe waits are usually pretty bad during the evenings, a phone-ahead reservation really helps."

I really like PH and see a lot of younger crowds than other places. But anyways we were getting hungry so we though since we're here we can get PF Chang. So we went to PF Chang and had to wait about an hour before we got a table. The place is pretty nice with it's design and look very modern. There's an upstairs but I don't know if you're able to eat up there? Looks nice though.\n\nOkay so we got a table and we decided to start off with Dumpling since the Dumpling I had at another PF Chang was really good. Also we ordered Hot & Sour soup. The dumpling turn out to be average and the soup tasted like...nothing. After we finish with that, I was hoping the food would be better because we're hungry. We ordered Pepper Steak, and Chicken with black bean sauce. Okay so the food came out, we were hungry and began to eat. Then, we all looked at each other like wtf? The Pepper Steak has no flavor at all, and the only flavor was the taste those small black pepper that's you're chewing on. The chicken was bad, but it's not as close as the Pepper Steak. Chicken doesn't have much flavor at all but at least it's more edible.\n\n I can't believe they're in business, I swear this is the worst Chinese Food I'd ever ate. I've ate at PF Chang a few times before and it was decent so they either need a new chef or something because all of the food suck. You ever get that feeling after eating like not being satisfied and wondering if you even ate at all? That's how I felt leaving there like damn, I'm not satisfied and I'm not full. I would give it 2 stars because the place look nice and server was decent but the food is that bad I'm sorry."

Love the scallops and fried rice with shrimp here. Nice and spicy on the scallops. The interior is great too. Most PF Chang's feel too large and cavernous. This one feels 'just right.' Service is great here too. They have a huge wait staff and are very attentive. They totally messed up drink order once, and just gave us a bunch of free drinks. It says a lot about the management, if you ask me, to have a stand out restaurant from such a lousy chain. Their prices are ok. Kinda steep, but welcome to Vegas, right? The wait times can be absolutely a turn off. We were told one day it was about 90 minutes. Next! But if you get there right when they open and eat dinner at a senior citizen time, you're in luck. A surprisingly decent place, very unexpected. I wouldn't visit it in my home area, but here, not bad!"

No complimentary soda after standing in front of you for almost 30 minutes after the time they said my food would be ready?

This was ok but very greasy. \n\nMy dish was the shrimp and vietnamese noodles.  The bowl came out looking the opposite of the picture in the menu.  The noodle were gray and way too much of them.  The shrimp and some type of meat protein were kind of hidden under the mound of noodles and were sparse and overcooked.  There was no flavor to this dish at all.  Bleh!\n\nMy friend ordered orange chicken and rice.  I had a bite.  Still no flavor.  Even the rice was bland which is weird because Asians flavor their rice with salt at least.  Whomever is heading the kitchen obviously does not care about p.f.

I was with four other people, and we all ate the beef and broccoli, and it was so salty that we had to complain even though we didn't want to. The waitress insisted that that's how they normally make it and that we would have to inform them next time if we want it less salty. So, the waitress gave a newly cooked and less salty plate of beef and broccoli. You could barely taste the flavoring of all the dishes. I have had the kung pao shrimp twice, and it lacked any kind of spiciness. Not even a hint. The kung pao shrimp was also salty, as well as the sweet and sour soup. We did the dinner for two and for the amount of meat they give, the amount of rice is lacking. \n\nI guess the pricey has to do with the high end appearance and up keep of the restaurant itself. It is nice and the servers are nice, but I definitely would not go there again. It's overrated and expensive."

We're hungry since we haven't eaten in the last 12 hours.  We're extremely dehydrated because all we've ingested over the same 12 hours are cocktails, martinis, ketel one with diet rockstar, basically all kinds of chemicals that make you feel drunk and/or wired, but most certainly do not replenish the water content of your body at the cellular level.   Since we're staying at the Aladdin, we decide to eat at P.F. Chang's as it's convenient and always good.\n\nThe wait for a table is 45 minutes so we opt to eat at the bar instead.  The bartender, Peter, and his assistant both totally rock and do a stellar job with impeccable service.  We start with drinks as I get yet another martini and my wife gets a pear mojito.  Before I ingest a drop of alcohol, though, I ask for a glass of ice water.  I then proceed to drink 7 glasses of water within the next 10 minutes before even touching my martini.  Clearly my basic bodily function have decided that my brain is too fucked up to make the right choice and the cells in my body decide that they need to unite against this tyrant who keeps feeding them alcohol instead of pure and rejuvenating water.   Thankfully, I'm not that stupid that I would fight such a primal urge, so I drink glass after glass after glass of H2O.   Although I get a quizzical look from the assistant behind the bar, she's happy to oblige and brings me glass after glass as fast as I drink them.\n\nWe got the crab wontons and the Peking potstickers as appetizers.  I then had the Dan Dan Noodles and my wife had the crispy orange beef.   The best, said she, crispy orange beef she has ever had the pleasure to eat at P.F. Chang's.   Now we've been to Woodland Hills, San Diego, Thousand Oaks, Walnut Creek, and Emeryville locations, so we're not newbies.   Still, by far, she said this dish shined far above any other she has ever had.  \n\nI had the Dan Dan noodles, which were quite good and had a good spicy kick to 'em.   I gotta say though that after the 8 or 9 glasses of water that I drank and the crab wontons that I chomped on, I wasn't all that hungry at that point.  My eyes glazed over which typically means that I'll be snoring away within the next 15 minutes.   We took this as our cue to head back to the room for some well deserved sleep."

The first experience, when we sat in the dining room on the main floor, was OK, but the second time, when we sat at the upstairs (YES, THERE'S AN UPSTAIRS BAR) with bartender Brandon, our server, was even better.\n\nWithout a doubt, Brandon was the most sincere and professional service person we've met up on our Vegas trip.  Everywhere you go on the Strip, from the baristas at Starbucks to the guys hustling shows on the overpasses to the check-in clerks at your hotels - people are wanting something from you (ie. Tips) and you get fake, effusive service as a result.  Not Brandon.  He was swamped with drinks, being the only bartender for the entire two-floor restaurant, but kept his humor and gave us great service.  We had HH chicken lettuce wraps (always great), northern style spareribs (just ok), and egg rolls (just ok), as well as the Organic Agave Margaritas, which were great.  (And cheaper during HH!)  I'm so glad our last night in Vegas was spent at that bar with Brandon; he made the experience of being there a little more memorable."

There was an hour and half wait, so we decided to order to-go and take it up to our room since that was only 10-15 minutes.. You can call ahead from your room too if you are staying at Planet Hollywood or their Towers.... \n\nLove their dan dan noodles, candied walnut shrimp, chicken noodle soup, hot and sour soup and their lettuce wrap... We order cashew chicken, lettuce wraps, dan dan noodles and hot and sour soup and it was a good portion... Prices are a little steep, especially for chinese food, but compared to other dining options in vegas, this is actually average, especially when you are able to do family style dining.."

We sat in an elevated booth, with a good view of the football game on TV.\n  I was satisfied with the shrimp lo mein, and shrimp fried rice. I had one gripe with the won ton soup. I felt that a bowl that serves three people was short on won ton.\n  In my opinion, this is a restaurant that is ideal for eating with others. It seems that popular Chinese food staples including fried rice and won ton soup are only served in family size portions.\n The visit ended off positive. One day we'll probably return here when my family is in town."

After browsing the menu, my friend and I discovered that it would be advantageous for us to order the P.F. Chang's For Two, because it included everything that we wanted to order and would be cheaper than ordering everything separately. Our server interrupted me while ordering and stated that it was too much food for us (unaware that we were going to order that much food anyway) and tried to discourage us from ordering that. The entr\u00e9es come with white or brown rice, but we asked if we could pay an upcharge to get fried rice, which has never been a problem at other locations. Initially, our server said that we could do that, but then later said that we'd have to order an entire side or entr\u00e9e of fried rice. Maybe this is the restaurant's policy, so no fault to the server there, but it is a terrible policy and they should rethink that. We settled for brown rice, but we were given white rice because they were supposedly out of brown rice. Number one, you don't give someone something that they didn't order just because you ran out and assume that they'll be okay with it. Number two, this would have been a good opportunity to offer us fried rice as a substitute since that's what we really wanted. We also asked for extra crispy noodles for our soup. The soup comes out with no crispy noodles at all, so we had to ask for those. In the meantime our soup gets cold. Drink refills were slow. Both of our drinks emptied several times. Often he walked past our table with a pitcher of water, but didn't stop to refill our glasses. One time he refilled my glass, but not my friend's glass, even though they were both empty. The only positive thing that I can say is that he is honest, because I had more money on my gift card than I thought I did, and he returned the unnecessary cash that I gave him. I will not be recommending P.F. Chang's to any of my friends that are visiting the Las Vegas Strip. The only reason that I'm giving three stars is because the appetizer (chicken lettuce wraps) and entr\u00e9es (crispy honey chicken and Mongolian beef) were delicious. The other two stars would've been awarded if we had good service."

If we ran out of anything, they would bring out more.  The food was good and the service was excellent.  The only downside was the excruciatingly long wait.

First off, I asked them to go light on the pepper flakes on my Kung Pao, since I am a baby when it comes to heat. And of course, it was loaded with pepper flakes. However, it didn't really  matter in the long run because our waitress's breath smelled like a dumpster and she kept breathing on me. Pop a mint, honey! I totally lost my appetite because her ass mouth and avoided conversation with her like the plague. Also, she was slower than cold tar, it took forever to get each course."

Also, Sarah told us that they've started taking the soy sauce off the tables and do it on request only... good to know! They also didn't do the pre-sauce mixture table side anymore.

The service is usually top notch, but my experience at this location was worth yelping about. \n\nThe hostess decided to look at me after I stood in front of her for two minutes. She told me the wait would be 45 minutes. Since I was meeting a long time friend for a concert I didn't mind..... \n\nWe waited, waited, and waited some more. We ended up waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes! The hostess was rude when we went up to check on it. She made us feel bad for asking. When we were finally taken to our seats we had to wait a while for our waiter. I'm getting used to all of this waiting by now even though I am starting to get hunger pains. No big deal. \n\nWe order and the waiter comes out with the sauce. Don't they usually do the sauce spiel every time? Maybe I'm just spoiled and use to the good service at the GV location. Regardless, he just poured the sauce and left. When we got our food the rice was the exact opposite of sticky rice. In fact, it was hard and resembled uncooked rice! Unbelievable. The good news was that the Dan Dan Noodles were out of this world! The distinct flavor of the cucumber cut the heat from the chile paste perfectly. The waiter did not ask if we wanted them cut. The Mongolian Beef was also a big hit. The meal would not be complete without their famous lettuce wraps which were delicious as usual. \n\nOverall I was satisfied with the food and the presentation minus the uncooked rice. It's PF Changs, who doesn't enjoy the food? The staff, however was really rude and unprofessional and my guest and I were highly put off by this. Next time I am at this hotel I am going to the sandwich shop and sticking to my PF Changs in Green Valley."

There was a bit of a wait, but that's was ok with us, we just sat and gambled a bit! Once we got a seat, we were sat outside, which was so nice and warm out, BUT we were literally sat behind a big column thing, which blocked us from all views of the other patrons and it was VERY dark there! We asked for more candles or if we could be moved somewhere else, the staff tried to be accommodating but since the restaurant was really full...they couldn't move us, but gave us 2 candles...oh well..we were too hungry to care that much. They food was great, I ordered the schizuan (sp?) scallops...soo good and spicy!!! Yum!!! My sister had the beef with scallions? I seriously think there was maybe 7 pieces of steak, tiny pieces, and a bagillion scallions!! My sister was not too happy. They also forgot her order of calamari..."

For that reason alone, it was a cute thought. They did a good job with our large group. There was more food than we knew what to do with. Just be realistic and don't expect a 5 star experience, and you'll be happy with the outcome."

Nothing special about the food, other than we were kept full on Americanized Chinese/fusion food. \n\nLiked the crispy veggie spring rolls with the sweet sauce.\n\nMain dish: sweet and sour chicken.\n\nBut it was good in technique, if not really original in flavors. Chicken was properly breaded and fried. I hate getting Chinese food takeout and the breading is falling off....not appealing. \n\nA pretty extensive menu, but with so much to eat in Vegas this simply would not be my first choice."

We ended up eating at the PF Changs and they were able to seat us right away and we sat outside on the patio. The patio area was nice because it was right on The Strip, but had an enclosed area to separate it from all of the crowds walking by.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and attentive, however, it did take awhile for our entrees to come out. He went back and checked on them and did apologize that it took so long for them to come out. Our water glasses were kept refilled, which was important given how hot Las Vegas was when we visited in mid-May. \n\nI ordered what I usually order at P.F. Chang's which is the Crispy Honey Chicken. The dish was good, but I wasn't able to eat too much of it due to the delay in it coming out and having to run to get to the show. We also got the 6 hand folded crab wontons from the dim sum menu (I had a coupon for a free birthday appetizer or dessert). Overall a good meal; however, being in Vegas, I don't know that I would pick to eat at P.F. Chang's again if we weren't so pressed for time and it wasn't right there just because there are so many other dining options."

The lunch plates offer you individual servings of varying dishes and come included with rice and either egg drop or sweet and sour soup.  You can easily have an entree, 2 drinks (non-alcoholic), and 2 of these lunch plates for $40 total.  Not bad considering the potential bill when dining family style and after 4pm."

Everything we had from appetizers to dessert was great, but the best part was our server Jose.  To say he should be mentoring every server in Vegas, would be an understatement.

We went at 8pm on a Wednesday and was told that there was a 45 minute wait and so we happily took our buzzer and went and sat in the Planet Hollywood's Extra bar. Their drinks were fabulous and 30 minutes later, the buzzer was going off. We were seated on the top floor in the back and so it was nice and quiet, despite the 2 long tables of people in front of our booth.\n\nThey have a 2-For-$40 deal that provides you with your choice of soup, one appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 mini desserts. Waaaayyyy too much food for 2 people but it allowed us to try all kinds of dishes. \n\nI started with a wine flight, that gives you 3 - 2.5 oz glasses of wine for $10. $10!!! Definitely took advantage of that as they have an extensive wine list. The bf had a beer as they were $3 and cheaper than anything you can buy on the strip. Bonus!\n\nFor our soup course, we both had the Sweet and Sour and it was full of chicken, mushrooms, tofu, and egg ribbons. It was kinda spicy but a nice way to start the meal. Portions are huge and so I felt bad about only eating half but otherwise wouldn't have been able to get past the appetizer flight.\n\nFor the appetizer, we had the Chicken Wraps. I had heard nothing but about how good these wraps are since we found the restaurant the night before. They lived up to their reputation though as everything from the lettuce to the little sauce that was customized for us, was wonderful. Again, the dish wasn't finished as you would have to stuff the lettuce leaves to capacity to get through all of the filling they provide you with.\n\nFor entrees, we had the Mongolian Beef and Cantonese Shrimp. The beef was accompanied by long pieces of green onion and wasn't too gingery. The meat was nicely seared so the marinade formed a crunchy outside. Delish! The shrimp were in a light garlic sauce and the snow peas were perfectly cooked. We had brown rice on the side and there was definitely enough food for 4 people. Yikes but yummmm!\n\nFor dessert, our fabulous waiter brought out a litle sample tray and explained each shot-glass sized dessert to us. We chose the Strawberry Cheesecake and S'more and while I was too full to try them, they were gone in about 30 seconds. The perfect end to a meal!\n\nIf you get this deal, either expect to have multiple leftovers or make sure you have a large party to help share the feast!"

My wife and I were shown to a table fairly quickly, which was good. But I was convinced that we were going to witness the second coming of Christ before a server approached our table. This was bad. We had just been book shopping before coming in here and I was thinking that maybe I had time to read my new book before we were waited on. I could have written one.\n\nA waiter, suddenly remembering that he had a job, finally came to our table and thanked us for our patience. There was no apology offered for our wait. Just an 'Atta boy' for hanging in there. He asked if he could start us off with some drinks but since we already had an eon to stare at the menu we were able to give our full order right away. I ordered the Chang's Spicy Chicken because there's nothing like sweet & spicy chili sauce when you're feeling ill-tempered. I didn't even bother to take a picture of my food to go along with this review. So if you've never seen what spicy chicken looks like - or a bottle of Budweiser, than I'm sorry to disappoint. But whenever I can't give you a picture - I WILL give you a thousand words.\n\nEverything started to proceed somewhat swimmingly from here -  and 'swimmingly' isn't a word I use very often so that's a testament to how much better things really were going. We got our food pretty quickly and it was good. The waiter even came by asking if he could get me another beer. He was probably trying to get me drunk in hopes that it would increase his chances of getting a decent tip (didn't happen).\n\nThen the invisibility formula kicked in again and we could no longer be seen or heard for another extended period of time. My wife asked if I wanted to get dessert but I was worried that might take another eight hours. I just wanted to pay the bill (or the 'check' as Americans so charmingly call it) and get out. We were finally able to get the waiter's attention and hand him our credit card. He disappeared without a trace for about ten minutes or so. I was starting to think that they truly didn't want us to leave. This must be how Henley and Frey felt when they wrote \"Hotel California.\" And Don Felder too. A staff member eventually approached us and said that their credit card machine was down and that they were waiting for it to come back online. Later on it did. And we left - never to return.\n\n\"Hotel California\" has always been a work of mystery with no one truly knowing what the lyrics are really about. I do. Me, P. F. Chang, and I suspect - H. G. Wells. Along with Henley and Frey, of course. And Don Felder too."

I do have to say their take-out counter is very convenient and is located next to the entrance.\n\nWe ordered the shaking beef which was too salty.  I'm a fan of salt but this dish had way too much.  The Dan Dan Noodles were ok. It was a little mushy and lacking flavor. I've had Dan Dan noodles at a lot of other places but this one tasted different. Cheesecake was good but tell them to put the raspberry sauce on the side, it tastes gross.\n\nOverall, if you 're looking for some take-out, staying at PH, hungry for Chinese, and have enough points on your Total Rewards players card so you don't have to pay for your meal then order here and try different dishes.  P.F Chang's is just too overpriced and their food is just ok. Total price for shaking beef, Dan Dan noodles and cheesecake was $37. We could have eaten at Gordon Ramsey's BurGr again for the same price and had a good meal but were too lazy to sit down and eat at a restaurant in addition to BurGr being super busy.\nI suggest going to the Rio and eating at KJ Seafood and Dim Sum if you feel like Chinese.

Die Lage ist super - man kann das verr\u00fcckte Treiben auf dem Strip beobachten und Spass haben. \nDas Essen war sehr lecker - der Salat war frisch und es gab viele Saucen zur Auswahl. Ich habe dann nach dem Essen noch einen Moscow Mule getrunken - daf\u00fcr gibt es einen Stern Abzug - der Barkeeper kennt das Rezept nicht oder hat bewusst die Zutaten vergesesen - im Grunde war es Eiswasser mit etwas Gurkengeschmack. Also: lasst die Finger von den Cocktails und geniesst das Essen und die Lage :)"

However, being vegan, in Vegas...my choices were a bit limited, so I ended up eating here twice.\n\nNo wonder this place is one of PETA's top 5 Veg-Friendly Chains! Both times I was there, the servers were extremely knowledgeable about what menu items were options for me, and tweaked items to make them vegan. \n\nAs previous reviewer said, there is no price mark-up here, which was a nice surprise. \n\nIf you're vegan, or visiting Vegas with someone who is, put PF Changs on your list of food options."

Also their ice teas are surprisingly pretty good- like their blackberry jasmine green.\n\nNow they have lunch specials- You have a few entree choices and you get hot& sour or egg drop soup.\n\nLunch specials are not badly priced and glad it was introduced after PF Changs stopped giving a discount to people who work in Miracle Mile/PH. Boo- they make so much money...really they can't? I normally am not a stickler about a discount but all other smaller chains and non chains offered a discount in PH but the largest chain can't to employees? Went from 25% to 20% to 15% to none in a matter of like a year. \n\nThey effed up my order a few times and it sucks having to run back and waste my lunch break. I had to get in the habit of checking everything before leaving as once it wasn't even my order, another time I only had half of what I ordered for me and the girls at work, and another I ordered sides of veggies and it wasnt in there. \n\nFor that, I can't really give them much due to their mistakes. It always ruined my lunch break since I end up having to get my food, take a few bites and I'm SOL and have to clock back in and eat lunch for dinner. That's fucked up that it happened 4 times before I got smart to look. And yes, they made a mistake twice after that and I got charged twice one day. \n\n2.5 stars for their mistakes and being discount stingy. 3.5 for the food as it usually was pretty big portions and tasty enough."

Although it was also lacking in spice, the dish contained a number of flavors that worked really well together and I should also mention that the shrimp was plentiful.\n\nWe also got a special Mai Tai for two in a Tiki glass and this thing was *enormous*.

She was great, very attentive!\n\nWhile I am usually a PF Changs fan, I would NEVER give my hard earned money to this poorly run establishment."

Growing up in the San Gabriel valley surrounded by real Chinese food I sometimes wonder if I'm allowed to enjoy this candy-like addicting concoction they serve here as food.  Proper or not, I like PF Chang's!  Although it's not the best food, it's tasty and it sure makes my mouth happy.\n\nI mentioned in my previous blog that mom was visiting from Korea.  We went to Vegas and stayed at Planet Hollywood.  While my hubby was playing poker, mom and I decided to eat at the PF Chang's located inside the hotel.  It is here that my mom's obsession with this restaurant starts all over again. \n\nWe always order the Garlic Noodles.  We LOVE this dish.  We also ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps that we enjoy.  We sat out in the patio and blissfully soaked in the fair weather while munching happily on our lunch.  Even our strange & annoying server who kept complaining to us about her other table of customers and kept trying to overcharge us (I had to tell her to fix our bill twice) couldn't ruin our meal."

We ordered it togo one of the days and the other day we ordered it through the hotel's room service. It's seriously the perfect meal when you want decent food and it's pretty yummy. \n\nI have eaten at many PF Chang's - one of my bestie's used to manage one - so I know the menu pretty well. But this time I tried some different foods and now have new faves. I really enjoyed the Dan Dan Noodles - spicy and similar to Pad Thai - soba noodles served with sprouts and goodness, Crab Wontons and the Combination Lo Mein. Good times!\n\nWe managed to order way too much food and had two meals with one order :) The restaurant itself gets packed since it's right on the strip so if you're staying at PH, go ahead and order to go and enjoy your american style chinese food. \n\nCheers!"

But after eating Caucasian food non stop since we landed, we decided to give this place a try. We were also intrigued by the line up outside the restaurant; and since we've never eaten here we thought we'd try this place. \n\nMy first impression of the place was 'wow'. A huge and quite a classy place so I was impressed right off the bat. Right outside, people can be spectators and watch the busy kitchen as they scoop, portion, scale, deep fry, pan fry and prepare the food. I'm always fascinated by this because this looks really cool to me. Anyway, my friend and I waited around half an hour for our food, which I wasn't very happy about. Thank goodness I had something to watch for half an hour while they make my food. \n\nWe ordered the Crab Wontons, Singapore Street Noodles, and the Shanghai Shrimp with Garlic Sauce. The wontons were nice and crispy, I LOVED the filling. The shrimp dish was pretty decent. I found the vegetables quite soft, which was surprising because Asian restaurants usually serve vegetables quite crisp. Well in Vancouver anyway. The noodle dish had a nice ,strong curry flavor. The shrimp was cooked well but the chicken was kinda tough and sinewy.\n\nOverall it was ok. I think the fact that I'm immersed in a wide variety of Asian cuisine here at home makes me more critical of Asian cuisine elsewhere. My friend best described it as \"white man's version of Asian food\". Which is actually very true. \n\nGood value for the price; I'm quite annoyed that I completely missed the dessert menu. I really wanted to try the Banana Spring Rolls, the Tres Leche Lemon Dream, the Apple Pie and the Carrot Cake. But really, I shouldn't be eating dessert while in Vegas. Just bad for my gut. \n\nThere's also a gluten free menu for you guys and gals who can't have gluten.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe. It wouldn't be the first place I would think of visiting but I would consider it. It gets a 3.5/5 from me, but I think I'll kick it down to 3/5 stars. It could be a lot better."

I was forced to go to a work thing at PF Chang's in another state and the food was awful - so now you understand my reaction. \n\nEither way needless to say we ordered some \"chinese food\". We ordered:\n- Lemon Grass Prawns with Garlic Noodles: this was YUMMY and the prawns were huge. \n- Chicken Noodle Soup: this was fantastic\n- Chicken Chopped Salad + Sesame Vinaigrette: this was a good salad but I think b.c. it was delivery it was not as good as it would have been in the restaurant.\n- Crab Wontons: eh - nothing special and not very flavorful\n- Chicken Lettuce Wraps: good reviews of this staple item\n- Dynamite Shrimp: Good\n- Almond & Cashew Chicken: Yummy\n- Egg Drop Soup: Good as well\n\nWhile all items were satisfying and between the four of us (yes all of that for only 4 people) we had crazy left overs. \n\nThe best part about this PF Chang's is probably their customer service. They forgot the sesame dressing for the salad and we were able to convince them to deliver it to the room. To make up for this inconvenience the manager included a piece of their cheesecake and some kind of chocolate amazingness (was it a brownie? chocolate cake? a large chocolate candy situation? No idea). Aside from them being nice enough to bring us the dressing the desserts were out of this world. I'm going to say this and I'm hoping there won't be any backlash from cheesecake connoisseurs BUT this was one of the best, if not THE best cheesecakes I've ever had."

This location had some of the FRIENDLIEST, most helpful servers ever. We had a party of 22 and received NO attitude from the staff. We had a private room upstairs and were given the choice of 5 set menus OR ordering individually. (most restaurants wouldn't give the choice...it would be the set menu 4 sho for a group that large) They obviously wanted to keep us boozed up cuz they were amazing at the drink service. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the drinks were only $5.50 a piece....and were poured heavy. Nice! The food was AMPLE, with about 10 different plates to choose from. Even though the food was served \"family style\" they provided every section of the big-ass table with their own plate of each dish. For about 10 dishes it was approx $29 per person....not including drinks, tax & gratuity of course. (It ended up being $47 a person) We even had control of the music level....which was turned all the way down due to the crappiness of the music. (Maroon 5, Jennifer Lopez, Matchbox 20...typical Star 98.7 shiz) This place is great for a big party...or if you crave mediocre chinese food at 12am. (they're open until 1am on wknds)\n\n(fyi, it's located in the \"Planet Hollywood Hotel\"....formerly the \"Aladin Hotel\")"

Chang's?!\"  The answer is yes, but let me explain.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were in town while my parents were also there. On some level I guess you could call them high rollers. That's different than being a baller. A baller would drop bills at a really fancy place. Not my parents, although they're not cheap either. Oh, and my grandmother was in Vegas too. She's cool, but simple. Nothing too flashy.\n\nThat's where P.F. Chang's comes into the picture.  It's a nice balance of fancy decor and unscale-ish food.  This is a big restaurant with a second floor.  That's where we sat and it was nice to be above the din of the casino.\n\nThe prix fixe menu is awesome. That's what Tyler and I chose. Two people get 4 courses for $45.  It turned into a lot of food and everything came out just as it should have (hot and well timed).  My only complaint would be about the batter on the shrimp, but I guess that's to be expected at a chain Chinese restaurant."

My friends and I walked over to PF Changs from MGM Grand - Very walkable distance and great spot on The Strip.  We had to wait for 20 minutes for our table, but we were given one of those vibrating, light-flashing coasters to let us know when our table was ready, so we went outside to wait and people watch until our table was ready.  Awesome dry desert heat, interesting people, and view.\n\nWe got a great booth and the service was awesome.  I asked if I could apply both gift cards to our total bill and he said of course I could. Win! :) The meals were reasonably priced and took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table.  We all ordered something different and I was hankering for some noodles.  Not sure what I ordered but I think it was deep friend noodles that were then stir fried.  What was I thinking...Anyway, the sauce was thick and the meal sat heavy in my tummy.  The food wasn't super duper in my book, but then I've only had one dish there so far.  Nothing super spectacular about the food that we ordered but we loved the restaurant, location, and service.  You can't beat that!  Oops, wait.  My friend ordered a shrimp dish that was actually fresh and delicious looking.  I will definitely go to PF Changs again to give it another try and we have one here in Seattle.  Next time I will try something less fried.  It's definitely worth checking out if you are in Vegas for the experience, price, and decent menu.  I did love the iced tea, though. Very refreshing. :)"

The host said maybe they could do takeout, which we said is at least something, and then he came back and said no.\nDidn't care if it was for my birthday or not, no effort to go ask someone like a manager or explain to the kitchen or anything like that.\nFail.\nSo, the food here is fine, but don't expect good staff or for them to do anything than the bare minimum."

I was going to be eating by myself, something that I usually don't enjoy doing so I tried to be good and quell my hunger with a fabulously healthy and nutritious Strawberry Whirl (with Immunity boost.. god I don't want to get this flu!) which I got inside the millennium mall next door.  I was restless and alone and needed some fresh air so I took a walk outside in the cold air with my cold drink around the corner to see what was going on at Krave.  Krave is gone.  It closed in October of last year and will be opening downtown in a few months or so the nice valet for the tony looking Italian restaurant that abuts the former Krave location informed me.  I headed back around the corner into the bright lights of the strip.  My Jamba Juice cup was empty.  My hunger was coming back full force.  I felt light headed and in need of comfort.  \n\nI headed into PF Chang's and got a seat at the bar and ordered a Sapporo and some Sesame chicken and struck up a conversation with my neighbors at the bar who were drinking saki and having a good time.  The vibe was great here.  Tony, my server, gave me excellent quick  friendly up beat service.  After I was warmed up a bit with my food and friendly surroundings two beefy cowboys from Houston took the seats on the other side of me at the bar.  They ended up drinking saki too and we had a great time talking and I didn't feel like I was eating or drinking alone any more.   My other neighbors left, and needless to say my cowboy neighbors corrupted me into ordering saki as well and I dragged my meal out for a few hours just drinking and talking with them.  They seemed to appreciate my company as much as I did theirs, but when 10PM rolled around I had to pull myself away and get my luggage from my room (just steps away upstairs at PH) and jump in a cab to the airport.  I did get their numbers though.\n\nThanks, PF Changs for delivering consistent good food and friendly service.  Wether it's Bentonville AK, Tyson's Corner VA, or even the strip in Las Vegas, NV.  You guys deliver and provide a nice atmosphere conducive to a relaxed good time.\n\nFYI.. The Large Saki I ordered was only $6.50 and packed a punch and I don't even think it was happy hour at the time since it was well after 8PM.. what a value!"

We had these yummy pan fried pork dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps to start and then we all shared the Pepper Steak, Crispy Honey Chicken, Crispy Honey Shrimp, and Mongolian beef.

            "review": "GREAT WALL OF SALT\n\nWe came here late on a Saturday night, after a long day of work. We were starving and just needed food. PF Chang's would not have been my first choice but one of the guys in our group was vegetarian, so we had to play it safe. \n\nWe decided to sit outside and do some people watching, while we were waiting for our food and drinks. There was a lot of crazy action on the strip.  Hey it is Vegas and every night is crazy.  The strange thing we noticed was that everyone stops to take a photo with the PF Chang Statue in front. Why? Those people aren't even eating here. Do they show there friends back home a photo of them standing on the strip in front of the PF Chang's Statue? Vegas tourists can be a little weird. \n\nOur waitress Kristina seemed to have a little attitude but then we found out she was originally from New York and that explained a lot. I know that sounds bad but I mean it as a compliment.  She was sassy and full of attitude but then after realizing she was from NY we knew she was actually being nice.\n\nI started my night out with the organic margarita. It is one of my favorites. In fact, I make these same drinks at home. Yes I stole the recipe from the PF Chang's in Mountain View, CA.  My coworkers all went with Mai Tai's. We totally needed drinks after our long day. See most people come to Vegas to have fun. For the last 20 years I have been coming here for work, so I really do not know what Vegas fun is anymore.  As you can tell because I am getting excited about an organic margarita. Look out Vegas I am on fire.\n\nWe then decided to order a bunch of food. We started out with the two orders of the lettuce wraps...one chicken and one veggie. The tofu in the veggie lettuce wrap was disgusting.  We also got a tuna Tataki, which was really yummy. My favorite part was the jalepeno on top. I always like some spicy to my food.\n\nFor dinner we decided to grab a variety of dishes. We ordered the shrimp, chicken & pork fried rice, Chang's spicy chicken, Tofu Pad Thai and the Kung Pao chicken extra spicy. \n\nEverything was edible but extremely salty.  We needed a couple of rounds of water to wash the salt down.  Honestly it was almost hard to eat but we were so hungry we just kept going. And I was not the only one at the table that made that comment, so I knew I was not being salt crazy.\n\nI would like to feel like I know authentic food.  One of the best things in my life was getting to work in Asia and actually getting to experience the amazing food. But the bad part about these experiences is that it ruins the taste of most of the Asian food available in America including chains like these. \n\nTo recap my evening here: Our waitress was great. My drinks were delicious but the food was just okay. I can hardly believe, at one time, I was in love with PF Changs but I am just not in love with it anymore. I wish I could share more but I just wasn't that impressed.  I honestly don't have that much to say, which is strange for me."

But, after hours of: a) traffic, b) looking for parking, and c) walking aimlessly around City Center, we were all too exhausted to drive to Palazzo! We ended up stopping by PH to get a quick drink, when my friend saw that there was a PF Chang's. She called her friend and made reservations at PF Chang's instead. It was a good decision!\n\nI love PF Chang's! No matter what you order, the quality of the food is excellent. What I also love is that they offer you brown rice instead of white rice.... I've never been disappointed. The 6 of us decided to order a variety of food - one poultry, one pork, one seafood, a salad and a noodle entree. YUM YUM for my tum tum! I was in heaven. My fav was the moo-shu and seafood entree.\n\nI would have given five stars had the wait been less than 2 hours. Mind you, we went there on New Year's day and on a Friday...Regardless, we all had a wonderful time! The waiter was very friendly, helpful and attentive. The wait for the food was not long at all.\n\nDelicious food. Great service. Good times with friends. Definitely would come back!"

Everything is fair in Vegas and Yelp!!! \n\nThis was the very first PF Chang's I ever went to, so it holds a dear place in my heart.. this was also the time I discovered the amazing food they serve. I didn't even know the name of the restaurant, I just knew what I ate there and what it tasted like. A few years later (maybe one or two) My friend told me he wanted me to try one of his favorite dishes and (hold and behold) it was the same exact thing I ate in Vegas! I believe it was Cantonese Chicken.  So tender, so tasty, so.. so.. ! Well, you get the point.\n\nI remember the experience this way:\nIt was May or June 2007. We were walking down the strip looking for something to eat. My companion had already been to PF Chang's and told me he really liked the chicken there. The  wait was about 45 minutes (I remember this because I said: I can't wait that long, I'm hungry!). We got a buzzer and walked to the bar at Planet Hollywood. I remember the big strobe light there... I took like 15 pictures of it.  We sat for a bit and before we knew it the buzzer went off. We were taken to the second floor, and what was so great is that we could bring our drinks from the bar with us! We ordered and got our food pretty quickly (I remember this because I believe I was counting the seconds!). I wouldn't say it was an extraordinary experience, but I would say that it was the start of a beautiful, long lasting, loyal and most importantly strong relationship between myself and this fabulous chain! I don't care if people say they are overrated, I love their food, their look, their service, hell.. I love that I can make reservations on-line!! We are in this Together Changy!! =0}"

They informed us they were closing in about fifteen minutes. Although they were closing soon, they still graciously served us. George, our waiter, was a pleasant delight. He was attentive throughout the meal. Our glasses were always filled with water and our silverware and dishes were clean. The food was served hot and nicely arranged. The Pad Thai had phenomenal flavor and the fried rice was delicious. The Sesame Chicken was flavorful too. Our large group had a fabulous time at P.F. Changs."

It was 4:30pm on Wednesday and we were sat right when we walked in. Our server was Ozzy and I cannot say enough good things about him. First of all he is an outgoing and very friendly guy. He gave many recommendations for both food and drink and we took his advice and ordered: spicy tuna roll, chicken lettuce cups, Singapore noodles, organize agave margarita and Asian pear mojito. He was personable and made us feel like friends not customers and made sure we knew about the PF Changes rewards program, which if you haven't signed up for you should ask your server next time you are in. We did not like the Singapore noodle dish because it has a very strong curry flavor which we are not fans of. When Ozzy noticed we didn't like it he apologized and without even our asking he brought over the manager and they took it off our bill. What a surprising treat their customer service is! They made sure we were happy with everything else and offered to make another dish if we wanted. We ended up ordering another spicy tuna roll which was AMAZING, thus the reason we ordered 2 of them. The happy hour menu is a great deal. We had 2 rounds of drinks and all that food and our bill was only$60 for Vegas that is crazy. After spending $250+ last night with terrible service and mediocre food we were more than thrilled with our experience here! I highly recommend this PF Changs location and request Ozzy as your server."

But if you don't eat meat, this is probably a good option in las Vegas, where I've found, options are quite limited. The lettuce wraps have a delicious filling, but they'd be better on romaine (not iceburg). The ma po tofu is a really big portion of both broccoli and spicyish orange sauce on crispy tofu; it's good but kind of heavy to attack by oneself. Everything is priced okay, but still, I wouldn't have gone here if it weren't for the terrible vegan options in Las Vegas."

I was especially pissed off by the bad service attitude of the waitress Stacy. First she messed up my order, and then tried to blame me for it. When the order was remade, it was awefully salty. After I got the bill, I told her that it was inedibly salty (I didn't eat 95% of the dish). I was just expressing my view and not looking to get it canceled on my bill or anything, but she just ignored me and picked up the dish and left. How about at least comforting the customer by saying \"sorry, next time we will make it better\". She just ignored me as if I am non-existent. Who the hell wants to eat at a restaurant where the waitress treats the customers like crap.\n\nI have been to PF Chang's in different locations a good number of times and have always been satisfied with the food and service, except this time. I guess it's the waitress Stacy that ruined my experience at this PF Chang's at Planet Hollywood."

It's a china bistro so it's nothing like your traditional corner restaurant with the buffet. \n\nTheir food is good but I normally wouldn't come back to eat all the time if it wasn't for the lettuce wraps ::cue the heavenly angel singing::. I love their lettuce wraps and even though I could successfully mimic them at home I don't want to have to go through the mess of all the condiments to make the lettuce wrap sauce ::cue singing again::. \n\nThey also give you the choice between brown rice and white rice. I bet that excites you huh? I know, I just like the idea of being able to go to a Chinese restaurant and eating a light meal that's good for you. Service is good and so is the rest of the food (which is family size portioned) but the only thing that I ever get are the lettuce wraps. They have a choice of chicken or veggie (I prefer the chicken but they are both just as good). I like it. I like it a lot."

In this case, I just couldn't ignore the service (or lack there of). To begin, we had a reservation and still had to wait for a table (understandable, but still). \n\nWe are finally seated, given menus, and order our drinks and the lettuce wraps since we know already we are going to want that. At this point we hadn't ordered our main dishes yet. \n\nSo we browse the menu, and decide what we will have as main dish. Our waiter however, is no where to be seen. In fact, we couldn't even flag down another server to call our server. We wait and wait and wait, and he finally appears with our drinks. We order our main dishes, and one of the girls in our group asks for sugar. He leaves, and nothing. No sugar. \n\nHe comes back a long time later with our lettuce wraps and when my friend asks again for the sugar he says coldly \"It is already on its way- I asked for it already.\" Woah there, way to be friendly! He also explains they only have one kitchen for two floors and that is why the food is taking so long. I'm sorry, that is not an excuse in my book. There are way bigger restaurants in New York City that are able to accommodate a big space with a full house. \n\nOur food finally arrives, and our friend the waiter once again makes a snide remark when one of us ask for something. I understand you might be having a bad day, maybe lost your paycheck at the Blackjack table, but don't bring your problems to work, buddy! \n\nThe food itself was really good, we had Singapore Noodles which I kept serving myself more and more of. We also had the orange beef which was good but not my favorite, was slightly chewy. The black bean chicken was fantastic-- delicious! And of course you cannot go wrong with the lettuce wraps though we made a huge mess. \n\nAt the end, my lovely girlfriends had asked the waiter to bring out a Birthday Cake and even gave them candles they had previously purchased. Our dear friend walks out with the slice of cake with the candles, and proceeds to light the candles in front of our table and just drops it in front of us. The cake was pretty good, chocolate cake is my absolute fav, but the raspberry sauce was a bit too overpowering for me. \n\nI definitely recommend going to one of PF Chang's other locations. I had a great time at the Atlantic City branch, complete opposite experience to the experience I had here. Get it together, PF Chang's!!!"

(Definitely were shrimp'd out by the end ) \nThe potstickers were crunchy with a ton of flavor and the same goes for the rice. It was so good that we hope the food will be just as delicious here in San Jose. \nOur service was excellent too! Don't know the woman's name, but she saw we had a baby & offered anything we needed for the baby, she'd bring it for us! \nMy husband and I were very pleased with our visit at this specific PF Chang's. We will definitely come again when we go back to Vegas!"

I know its a large restaurant chain and you should get the same product no matter where you go but this one USED to be better. We we were seated our waitress let us know that they have had allot of changes. The staff was all polite, and we were seated quickly because we had a reservation (45 min wait without one so call ahead. We after we ordered our food came quickly and looking forward to my meal i was disappointed because i learned what all the changes had been on my first bight. This PF Chang's was now just like the other PF Chang's that i had been to not much flavor in the food ( if you are going to put a warning on the menu the the food is spicy make it spicy not bland. If you like other PF Chang's you will enjoy this one too if you like flavor in you food this is not the place for you.  Overpriced for what you get."

I've been to a couple of different P.F Chang's around the valley and I always have a pretty good time. This time...not so good. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:00p and I'm not going to lie, I am notorious for being late. By some birthday miracle, I made it to the place about two minutes after 8. I know, late is late, but when my boyfriend made the reservation they told him that ours would be given away if we were 10-15 minutes late...a little confusing, but whatever. We got our table just fine. Food and drinks were good as well. \n\nOur waitress was nice, but she seemed aloof - which is not something I would hold against someone. What I did have a problem with is her whisking my food away that was barely touched. We were sitting in a U-shaped booth and I was turned to face the group to talk. I wasn't watching over my food(I didn't think I had to) and I had a couple of drinks, so I was definitely very into whatever I was talking about. I could understand that maybe she didn't want to interrupt me...personally, I would have preferred her doing that instead of just taking the food away without checking. My other friends weren't talking, so she could have asked them about it and they would have asked me. We spent $200 that night. That's a fortune to me and to leave with no leftovers when there was plenty....well, I consider THAT a dinner time atrocity. I know I should have said something then, but everyone was leaving so I didn't. I really should have because it's been bothering me! 9/10 times, I always eat my leftovers the next day. Wasting food is a huge pet peeve of mine...and in this situation it severely irks me because it was food that I was going to eat. Maybe a good solution would be to re-train that server and make sure all of the servers are on the same page.\n\nA warning to all who choose to dine at P.F Chang's in Planet Hollywood: Make sure to keep a steady eye on your meal if you are like me and want to get the most for your money by taking the leftovers home."

The crab wonton/ragoon's are really awesome too, it's definitely a must!  I've had a few different entree's here, that are off the hook too!  This place is cheaper than the quality of the food is, it's unbelievable!  If you want a reasonably priced meal that is over the top, give this place a try!  I can't talk more highly about this place!"

Chang's before and had a comparable experience.  The food and service are consistently good, and the beer and wine selection is excellent (compared to other Chinese restaurants).  I would give this restaurant a solid 3.5 rating if you rate by half points."

The servers are trained well here. \n\nWe shared just about everything so I would have to say the food was really good"

From the moment we walked in, the manager was standing next to the hostess at the hostess stand and told us it would just be a moment and then had us wait several minutes to just put our name in. Once we sat down, the table was dirty, there was food under the table, and the utensils were dirty. After we placed our food order, our server brought out plates and those were dirty too. When she brought out new plates two of them were still dirty. Then we get our egg drop soup (the only good thing) and the chicken lettuce wraps that basically consisted of just water chestnuts and little to no meat. We asked if the gave us the vegetarian lettuce wraps since we couldn't find any meat and the food runner said no chicken so we sent that bad dish back. Once we got our main dishes, Mongolian beef and Changs spicy chicken, the beef was completely burnt and tasted like charcoal and the chicken was overcooked and dry. We told our server the dishes were burnt and not as expected and that the quality was horrible and being busy was not an excuse for poor quality food. The manager was not very apologetic and seemed more disturbed than anything."

I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \n\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though...."

Server was impartial to me but at least knowledgeable of my gf requirements. Ordered lettuce wraps which were to my liking. $4 drinks for happy hour, yes please. 4 stars for being a reliable gluten free restaurant no matter what city I'm in."
