            "review": "We came here after a show at the Variety Theater at the Miracle Mile Shops. They are located inside Planet Hollywood and are open 24 hrs. The good part about this place is they will absolutely have something for everyone in your group. From Chinese, to burgers, to salads, breakfast, steak, and everything in between. The place has a nice enough decor and is set back from the casino so you don't feel like you are in the middle of it. They have several small TVs set around the restaurant that play videos, both obscure and current. I got the Nachos Grande as it was the only thing that sounded good to me at the time. (Not something I would normally order) This would be a better dish shared as an appetizer amongst about 4 people as I didn't even make a dent in it. It was very good though with the jalape\u00f1os on it and the crunch of the chips with the Kobe meat from the chili. Very good flavor! Our server Creiz did a great job staying on top of our refills and was very friendly. \n\nMy tip for this place: we purchased a voucher through Tix4Tonight for $3 each which gave us 50% off our entire meal! A great deal! If you plan ahead just a little bit or are going to be in the area seeing a show stop by here for an affordable meal."

I ordered the chicken and waffle thinking it was somehow be similar to Rosco's chicken and waffle and oh boy was I completely wrong. The chicken was a chicken breast!!! Tasted like a big chicken strip :/ no bueno. The waffle was over cooked (simi burnt) and it tasted dry and blan. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Go to another hotel and have some good food over there."

I had the Rachel and pad Thai and was very happy with the flavor of both dishes. I like this place because of it's relaxed atmosphere and also for the fact that holly Madison comes here. Maybe one day I'll run into her."

I was so happy and comforted when staying at Planet Hollywood because I knew I had the great food here to come home to late-night. And then I'd feel better in the morning too...\n\nThere were 8 of us girls staying at the Planet Hollywood hotel and, a couple nights, the 8 of us dined together at Planet Dailies at around 4 AM. The other night, I still ate here but with only one other friend who'd stayed out late with me... I could miss my fourth meal of each Vegas day at Planet Dailies!\n\nThe menu is extensive and yummy (especially late-night!) and we tried everything from fries, to omelets, to burgers, to steak. The Bellagio's late-night food has nothing on Planet Hollywood's!"

            "review": "This is like any other regular restaurant that has an eccentric menu of everything. They offer breakfast, asian food, soups, nachos, and everything that your heart desires. My friends had ordered a medley chicken nachos, chicken and waffles, wonton noodle soup amongst other things. I think that the location is great since there are no other moderately cheap dine-in places in Planet Hollywood. To be honest, I was really getting sick of eating Panda Express and Earl's Sandwiches. The waitress was very friendly for putting up with such a large party (15+) and especially since some of us has brought fast food in to eat with our friends. \n\nThe best part was that they gave us these tiny little ketchup bottles and jam jars for each individual. Sure, it was hard to take out such little ketchup in one of those mini glass jars, but I really appreciate the little cute things.\n\nThe worst part however was that they did not have a restroom. In order to wash your hands and such, you have to walk out of the restaurant and go into one of the public restrooms. I feel as though many people can easily just dine and ditch when you have to walk so far to get to a restroom. Nonetheless, I would probably come here for a late night snack after the clubs."

If they have their doors open for business I expect good and fast service no matter what time of the day we show up. \n\nWe were there around midnight and in search of a good steak but everything was closed. Decided to give this place a shot. \n\nIt took the waiter about 20-30 minutes to take our order. Ordered the surf and turf plate which was priced $30 which seemed overpriced but decided to try it. We ordered medium rare but it came out our rare and  informed our waiter about the issue. He took the plate back but brought out the same exact piece of steak which was now burned!!! WTH.... so we told him to take the dish back!!! \n\nWe also had the lettuce wraps - which seemed to be fresh out of a microwave and not fresh!!! \n\nI was extremely disappointed with the food and the customer service and I am never eating here again!!!"

Then again they were trying to get tips out of drunk people. I vaguely remember sports being on the TV set so of course that increases the ambiance. But then again I was drunk.

Breakfast of champions IMO ! Warm goodness in my tumtum. \n\n'Planet Dailies' was the spot our group of gals chose after walkin' endlessly in Vegas. \n\nOn to the marks for the good, bad, and ugly !\n\nGood: \n\n- Seated almost immediately with a group of 6. \n\n- My Ahi tuna salad was delish. Not overly seasoned and it wasn't doused with so much dressing that you could barely taste the delicate flavors of the veggies and ahi tuna. \n\n- Free mini Heinz ketchup bottle ! Well, at least the girls figured it was free. Cute memorabilia ???\n\n- Lively and flat screen TVs are seen throughout. A good place to catch a game and maybe grab a few drAnks.\n\nBad:\n\n- Menu suffered from a case of mistaken identity. Are we American, Asian, Italian, or Mexican ???\n\n- I love options, but looking at the menu made me crave for a broad range of things from oatmeal to wonton soup ?! Oy ! I'm indecisive enough as it is. Why must you torture me 'Planet Dailies' ? Why ?\n\nUgly:\n\n- An extensive menu comes with a ridiculous price. Basic breakfast food items you can get from Denny's is twice the cost here. No bueno.\n\nOverall, I give this place a 'C' aka 'meh' since I enjoyed my meal. \n\nWould I go back ?? It's open 24 hours..so maaaybe under the influence. Everything tends to get a boost in rating when I'm typsy ! o_O !"

The fries and the presentation of the sliders ALMOST made up for it......wait, no they didn't.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/planet-dailies-las-vegas?select=mkLOZwHuVX5tHdhdqesqBw#mkLOZwHuVX5tHdhdqesqBw\nAfter the Kobe disappointment, I stuck with the House Salad (4 stars) and Tex-Mex Eggrolls (5 stars). Cooking burgers/sliders may not be your thing, but you're a champ when it comes to Tex-Mex Eggrolls.......easily one of the best I've ever had\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/planet-dailies-las-vegas?select=mkLOZwHuVX5tHdhdqesqBw#htJFxHyBY9jQaACIKLrF5g\nWhy only two stars?

Now I know not to bother with going here again. \n\nSince we stayed at Planet Hollywood where this is located, we wanted to try it. Every time we walked by everyone's meals looked amazing! We didn't bother to check the menu first; we were hotel guests and had a 10% off coupon to eat here. It was close, we were famished, so in we went.\n\nTalk about your sensory overload! I don't think there is anyplace at Planet Hollywood that is quiet and relaxing. The loud music blared the entire time. This was in addition to the TVs wrapping around the room, each one showing something different. That's too much for me. What happened to at least being able to play Keno while you wait for your meal and dine?\n\nOur server was friendly, menu choices were ok; the food took a little longer than we thought it should have. I had a crab cake sandwich which came with French fries and Larry ordered the Reuben which also came with fries. Food was slow coming out of the kitchen but our server made several stops by our table to check on us and let us know it would be out soon.\n\nMeals looked yummy upon arrival. Thin, crispy, French fries are stacked in a cute paper cup and you get your own mini-bottle of ketchup to just dip them into. That was fun. My sandwich was very so-so however. I couldn't taste much crab and it was kind of mushy. Larry's Reuben looked good, it was on marble rye and piled with meat and kraut, although I didn't try it. \n\nThis meal would've been decent had it not cost around $35 for two people for lunch with the 10% off! No dessert and we both just had water. Not worth a return visit when there are so many other choices."

The lobster was really chewy and fishy tasting."

So our waitress comes and she says we can only order breakfast.  Lunch and the Asian dishes can only be ordered after 11am.  11am?!  Even McDonalds starts serving lunch earlier than that!!  And we couldn't even order a side of fries! She couldn't even take our order now and give it to the cooks at 11. So we take more time to look at breakfast only.\n\nI ordered the chicken and waffle ($16) along with 4 other people at our table.  Food took forrrevver to get to our table.  By the time the food came, it was already time to start serving lunch.  But there was one person at our table who didn't get their meal.  We asked the server and he checked the ticket and says it wasn't on there. WTF, our waitress totally didn't even add it!  And we couldn't even confront her about it because she never came back to our table to see if everything was OK, we had to flag down our server to let them know the order was missing.  \n\nFood quality was subpar.  The syrup they provided was not regular maple syrup.  It actually tasted pretty nasty with my waffle so I ate my waffle without syrup. The chicken was dry with not much flavor, so we all asked for ketchup (hella filipino) to dip our chicken in.  But when we asked, they only gave us a tiny serving of ketchup.  When we asked for more ketchup, specifically a bottle of ketchup, they just brought out more mini cups of ketchup.  \n\nIt would have been nice to see some kind of discount given or comped something since the service was slooowww and our waitress forgot one of our orders.  This joint is open 24/7 but be warned you can ONLY order breakfast from 6-11am.  Otherwise the menu options look good, just too bad we couldn't have any of it!"

We asked some of the staff what was open at the time we were looking for a restaurant + bar (around 3am) and he said only McD's, Planet Dailies, & Earl of Sandwich. LIES! So many things were still open even after we ate. Boo.\n\nService is super slow even with not many customers. We had a table for 5, got a bucket of beer, waters, and diner food. Beer came in a low level of ice and the beer wasn't even chilled! Took forever to get cold after we added some salt in the ice bucket. Waters needed refilling and we were able to get one towards the end of our stay...dude what?!\n\nWe ordered 2 omelets, a loco moco, croissant French toast, and fish tacos. I remember the guys saying the omelet was edible but not great (Denny's was even better), loco moco was ordered with eggs over easy and steak medium rare and ended up eggs over hard and steak super well done (they were even crispy) and dry, and didn't provide much gravy. No island flavah...L&L mo bettah. The fish tacos tasted bland, fell apart and had to be eaten with a fork. The croissant French toast was probably the best one there (dipped in creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e batter and dusted with powdered sugar).\n\nWe sat right next to their register and still wasn't being served much, and holy crap the food was expensive!!! The croissant French toast and fish tacos order (with just water, mind you) came out to be $27.00 after tax. Yeah...\n\nBest bet is walking around as other bars and restaurants are still open after 3am AND McD's will probably even be a better choice.\n\nYou've been forewarned."

I ordered the wedge salad with dressing on the side, bacon cheeseburger and fries.  I asked them to chop my salad for me.  My salad came out really fast (2:30 pm).  Unfortunately it tastes terrible!  The blue cheese salad dressing tastes like miracle whip and the bacon is questionable. YUCK!  I added some pepper to give it some flavor and the somewhat helped.

I've been here before but failed to remember the incredibly thick menu they have.  My guess is I only came here to sober up before calling the night.  I don't remember too much of the past but the sober me that went recently found this place to be A-OK.  I guess I must have been on hot streaks when I went to Planet Dailies in the past because a sober me would never want to spend $20 on a salad, despite it being good, at a casino cafe.\n\nOne thing that really got on my nerve though was when our waiter described to us their Egg Drop Soup ($10.95).  He described it as the size of a Pho Noodle Bowl, so we decided to have it thinking it was a lot of soup for a party of 4.  When it arrived...the bowl was huge but \"where was the soup we thought?\"  The soup filled only a quarter of the bowl...wow!...we got hosed.\n\nHere's what we orderd:\nEgg Drop Soup $10.95\nCrab Salad $20.50\nCarbonara $14.50\nReuben $13.99\n\nThe Crab Salad was a superstar although a bit pricey.  The Egg Drop Soup was a rip.  The Carbonara was alright.  And, the Reuben was good enough to clean the plate.  As for the customer service, the waitstaff here starts off really well, but fades away in the end (e.g. never checking up), otherwise it's not bad at all.\n\nThe food is OK, but I'd definitely check up Tix-4-Tonight for 1/2 price at Planet Dailies because the restaurant is pricier than other cafes.

The manager was good enough to take it off our bill, but of my whole entree (Chicken, garlic mashed potatoes, and spinach) really the spinach was the only truly edible part of the meal."

They have a wide variety of choices, but it is quite pricey for being a \"cafe\". I get the cool look, it's Vegas, etc, but it was still overpriced in my opinion(and several others on here it appears). The portions were decent for us only wanting a small to mid sized bite, but had I come here with an appetite I may not have been so thrilled. I had the $22 spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce was ok and the meatballs were pretty good. My wife had the wonton noodles, and didn't really care for them. The noodles were ok, but she did not like the wontons at all. It was a decent portion I guess, maybe. Our server was good, which makes this place maybe 3.5 stars. Overall this place didn't suck, but I likely won't return because I can get better for the money I would spend here, even late at night."

We could have gone somewhere else, but we had just walked into Planet Hollywood, so we went for PD. First, I thought the menu was weak. There were not as many options as I've grown accustomed to at casino cafe's, and the prices were insane. I got an egg white scramble and paid about $15.00. It came with two pieces of toast, and a small heap of fries. Other members of my family had equally pricey meals. The food quality wasn't bad, but I just can't get over the price...I don't care if it is a strip property or not, that is too much for breakfast. The service was so-so.

It was a NY steak cooked medium-rare with crumbles of bleu cheese and fried onion strings on top. It was served with a baked potato and a vegetable medley. The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted really good with the bleu cheese and onion strings. The vegetable medley was very undercooked. \n\nMy boyfriend had the ribeye steak cooked medium-rare, and also served with a baked potato and vegetable medley. The steak was good, but the vegetable medley was also undercooked."

A friend and I shared the Bacon Cheeseburger and some potato skins as an appetizer.  The potato skins were OK, a little too thick cut for my liking.  I ordered some ranch to go with the skins and it was gross!!  I know every restaurant has their version of Ranch dressing but this one was pretty bad (call me picky).  The burger on the other hand was delicious!!   The meat was juicy, and the fries were also really tasty.  All in all this place was really good.   THe couple next to us was having what looked like a turkey sandwich and it was huge!!  Anyway, this place is solid if your looking for a good burger, other than that I'm not too sure how good the other food is.  Go and check it out!!"

I ordered a burger and fries because I needed something greasy the food was okay nothing to be impressed by. As Emily had disappeared for a while and we needed assistance my friend decided to ask another waiter by the name of Marvin. He was extremely rude and of absolutely no help.

My husband ordered an omelette and he said the same thing about the eggs, he said it wasn't that good.

I love spaghetti, so how could I pass up an all you can eat pasta special in a Strip resort cafe? My experience here puts an answer to that question. The service and food was not up to the expectations I have for a restaurant that usually charges over $15 for a burger. \n\n  The \"all you can eat pasta with salad\" special, as another yelper wrote, is a joke. I am seriously under the impression that it is a scam. What makes me say that? When the waiter served me the spaghetti, it was only pasta (I had to ask for sauce). Aha! Then I turn to Yelp, and another reviewer wrote that if they put sauce on the pasta it is $4.95 each refill. These were red flags and a negative first impression of Planet Hollywood's coffee shop. When I pressed the waiter about this, he stated that it is free with sauce. At any rate, the pasta was unworthy of a high calorie refill. To put it nicely Sbarro was better-at least they have meatballs.\n\nThe restaurant is understaffed, causing  an overworked waiter to serve many tables. The consequence is slow service. If I relished the pasta, I would pass over waiting the equivalent of a couple baseball innings for a refill. If you eat here I recommend that your batteries are fully charged on your smart phone. You could be sitting here a long time. By the way the overworked waiter was friendly-one redeeming fact in keeping the rating at 2.\n\n  Another minor complaint I have are the booths. The booths are too plush and this causes the table to be in a higher proportion than your shoulder-at least if you are my size.\n\n  I would pass over Planet Dailies. So overpriced and slow service. If you are in Planet Hollywood, I recommend the restaurants in Miracle Mile, or even McDonald's."

I accompanied my girlfriend here after a night of drinking and staying up late. She was hungover like a mofo, so we thought food would make her feel better. Plus she said she'd pay, since I held her hair for her while she puked up a boot. Unfortunately, I wasn't very hungry and I'm kind of trying to watch my figure so I went with the biscuits and country gravy with a side of grits. My alcoholic girlfriend ordered a glass of orange juice and a country omelet. Although the food is pricey, you get a pretty large portion. My biscuits were very buttery and the country gravy gave it a nice creamy texture to them. The potatoes were delicious and the sausage was just wateves. Luckily my girlfriend had to puke some more, so while she was gone I got to taste her country omelet. It sucked. cold, gross, and rubbery. Anyways, I asked for the check and to my surprise the meal was over 40 bucks. My girlfriend's OJ was 6 bucks. damn. if you get a screwdriver on the casino floor, that would have been free. I went thru my girlfriends purse and gave the server her credit card. -1 star for lack of security.\n\nA little about my credentials:\n\nI first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image.

I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures."

He is exactly what every employee working in an restaurant should be like. My boyfriend and I both work in the restaurant industry and we would definitely love to have him on our team. \n\nWe ordered a few appetizers- the blacked ahi and the chicken lettuce wraps. The ahi was delicious! Perfect sear, and seasoning, as well as delicious chunks of avocado in between each piece. The lettuce wraps were ok- I am more use to like a really chicken but this one was more like a ground chicken. \n\nFor our entrees I got the bacon, cheddar burger and asked if I could get an egg on it. They were able to accommodate my request thanks to Jose. The burger was huge and very good. I only are about half- the fries were delicious! My boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he also enjoyed. \n\nIt's your typical cafe/diner food but to the next level. Thanks Jose for making our experience great!"

They have almost everything on the menu from omelettes to burgers, pasta, chinese food, soups, salads, and steak. Their ahi tuna salad and cilantro chicken salad is pretty good. I also always get their lemongrass soup, hot and sour soup, or egg drop soup. Their food is decent and they always have deals going on like breakfast specials, all you can eat pancake specials, happy hours, etc. throughout various times on certain days. Their specials are actually really good deals because it is a lot cheaper. For example, they had a breakfast special when we went on a Friday morning. The breakfast special ended at 11am that day and the steak and eggs was only about $6.99. \n\nHowever, the service here is terrible! The waiters take  long time to acknowledge you have just been seated. When you have already placed your order, it takes forever for food to come to the table. I've been here when the restaurant was full and when the restaurant was empty. The wait for our food took just as long when it was empty. They also forget to bring you things when you ask for extra sauce, utensils, water refills ,etc. \n\nOverall, I come here because of convenience, the food is alright, and I'm usually not in such a hurry. I'ts just frustrating sometimes that they take forever and forget requests."

Turned out I would have preferred Denny's over this place. \n\nWe went for a late dinner after driving hours to get to Vegas. Was seated immediately because there weren't too many people. The lighting was very dim and the decor/furniture/waiters' uniforms was very blah. All the staff there seemed bored to death. Very apathetic and their attitude screamed that they did not want to be there. And that attitude spoke out, because our waiter went missing for a long time. Saw her flirting with a co-worker. Had to flag her down to get water refilled and get some Tabasco.\n\nThey serve breakfast all day, which was nice as I was feeling breakfast. But their prices were RIDICULOUS. Cheapest thing on their menu was $12 and it goes up to $25. I paid $12 for 3 scrambled eggs (looked more like 2 eggs though), 2 pieces of bacon, 2 pieces of toast. At least they gave me some butter and jam for my toast. A luxury! Taste was ok, but it's eggs and bacon...can't really mess that up. Wasn't worth $12. More like a $6 meal. \n\nBasically, if we had known the prices were so high, we would have gone to Gordon Ramsey's BurGR, which was literally right next door. The burger they are known for costs about $12 and this is gourmet we're talking about! Planet Dailies was a big let-down and a big rip-off."

Went to dinner here two nights in a row this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised at their food. \nThe first night I went with a group of friends, but I wasn't too hungry so had their Tex-Mex egg rolls which were pretty filling. They had some bite to it, thanks to all the delicious chili action going on. My friend's hubby got the Pad Thai, which he totally devoured and loved. While my egg rolls were tasty, I couldn't help but eye his noods.\n\nThe following night my best friend and I went for a late din after our concert and we were starving! Got the chicken lettuce wraps and a side of the house fried rice. WOW, the rice was amazing! I'm Filipino, was raised off Asian food and eat fried rice for breakfast more than I'd like to admit - I have to say that that was probably the best simple fried rice I've ever had! The lettuce wraps and the rice combination was simple and genius, two things I love! \n\nMy BFF and I were thinking of going again for dinner but alas, we stayed on the strip but quite a ways away unforch. I would definitely go back in a heartbeat if not to only chow down on the lettuce wraps and fried rice - soooo delicious!  \n\nThe service the first night seemed a little off at first but then it ended up being fine. The second night our server was superb - he was the one who pointed out the lettuce wraps. Also, love the fact that they are generous in giving out refills!"

Went about 10:30 am and there was no wait. Our server (I think his name was Mahi) was excellent. Took our order in quickly, brought our beverages in short order and the food came very quickly and was very hot. One of us had the salmon benedict and the other a standard egg dish. Both dishes were good and served with breakfast potatoes that were also very good, fresh and hot. Also have had lunch here several times over the last few years and always thought this restaurant is a good standard - by that I mean service has proven to be good and food is fresh, tasty and served timely."

Unfortunately, their food is disgusting and lacks any flavor.\n\nI ordered the Ham & Cheese Omelette ($13.99/14.99 w/o TR Card)  combo which consisted of the following:\nthe omelette\ntoast\nroasted potatoes\n\nThe Omelette (2 stars): I don't think this was made with real eggs. The texture had a very slimy consistency. Even the portion size was ample, Paying $15 for an omelette not made with real eggs is not on my Vegas to-do list.\n\nToast: (1 star): It's really a giant piece of bread, not even cut. I tried to take one bite into the toast...inedible. It was impossible to eat because the toast was too dry and hard to bite into.\n\nRoasted Potatoes ( 3 stars): Sadly, the best part of the menu. It's pretty hard to mess up cooking potatos, right?\n\nThere are many 24 Hour Diners on the Las Vegas, almost all of which are better and cheaper than Planet Dailies. If you find yourself hungry and don't want to leave Planet Hollywood, please follow the marked signs and head to Earl's Sandwich (also open 24 hours)"

Now don't get me wrong, it isn't because I love this restaurant but more because I always happen to stay at Planet Hollywood (which I have a separate review for, dont even get me started on that) and it is the only 24 diner.\n\nFood:\nThis is PH's version of Cheescake Factory.  They have a ridiculously large menu with everything on it from various cuisines.  Most recently, I tried the Kobe Beef Sliders which are about what you expect for sliders.  They aren't terrible but nothing spectacular.  My bf ordered the meatloaf which was pretty tasty.  This dish came in very generous portions, 2 large piece of meatloaf and large ice cream scoop of mash potatoes with gravy drizzled all over it.\n\nA friend of mine order the Chicken Parmesan and that plate seems like it was meant to feed a family of 4.  There is a heap of pasta with a giant piece of chicken that had double side batter.\n\nWe also had potato wedges, which were giant sized and tasted pretty good, very greasy- yum.\n\nBottom line, I would say this is up to par with Cheesecake, about average.\n\nService:\nAbsolutely horrible. Consistently. Every time I come here.  The food seriously takes forever to come out and they rarely get the order right.  Somehow, at least one persons order gets messed up or don't even come at all- which is what happened in the most recent trip.  My friend's entree didn't come at all until we pointed it out and by the time they brought it out, everyone else was done.  We said to just cancel it cuz there was no point and there response was a simple \"ok\"- no apologies, nothing.\n\nBasically, when you come here to eat, be prepared to be here for at least 1.5 hour for a party of 4 of fewer.  If more than that, prob 2 hours.\n\nPrice:\nVery pricey, especially for the quality. That is, unless you are ok with paying $18 for mediocre pad thai.  Not that I would come here to order pad thai but that's just an example of their ridiculous prices."

Love that gooey yolk! We ended up getting this dish twice, on separate days, once for takeout since we were in a hurry, and once for dine-in. Open 24 hours, conveniently located in Planet Hollywood. They give a lot more rice and gravy for the dine-in plate, which is expected.Everyone can kind of slap a dish together for takeout, but presentation would count more for dining in. Either way, delicious, and thoroughly enjoyed. Especially on a cold night, this was really warming and comforting. \n\nAnother time, I got the egg white omelette with cheddar cheese/tomatoes. Nothing special about this meal -- more scrambled than an omelette, but the french fries were thin and crispy, with a little batter on them. Sourdough bread slice with butter and jam rounded out the meal. Hearty enough to start the day or afternoon, or a late night snack. You get hungry pretty quickly thereafter with this meal. \n\nBoth dine-in service and take-out are really friendly. Hostesses are always greeting you or saying goodbye, answering questions I had about the menu, etc. We were given to go water cups while we waited for our take out order. \n\nOur server, Nathan was super nice, came by multiple times to either check on us or clear our plates. Was tentative to my husband's drinks and whether he wanted more. Never rushed us -- it was not busy at either time we stopped by, and it was a very large space with plentiful tables. \n\nIt was an open air type of restaurant though, so you could always smell smokers passing by."

There was the gummy/chewy calamari that came to the table in an abundant, but lukewarm oily pile.  The lettuce wraps, wherein the chicken/peanuts/water-chestnut mix was so homogenous, it was scary.  The fried chicken and waffle with the overcooked flavorless dry chicken \"breast\" patty sitting unceremoniously atop an unremarkable waffle (okay, the honey-butter was okay...!)

We had 45 minutes before the show, and the waitress did an excellent job with the rush service, although that might be because the place was empty on a Saturday night.\n\nThe filet mignon ($15 after 50% off) was good, but not great, which was expected from a non-steakhouse like this.  My friend got the side of mac-and-cheese with the steak, and it was huge - cereal bowl sized, but she said it was just ok.  My mashed potato side was again huge, but nothing exciting.  The side salad was decent for a salad with diced tomatoes and other veggies rather than being just from a bag.  The other friend got the lobster pasta (fettuccine, I think?), which he said was good.\n\nOf course being Vegas, we were tempted by the $5/glass or $20/carafe sangria.  I distinctly remember one friend saying, \"it needs more red wine\" after tasting, but it hit us hard by the time dinner was over.

After my 3rd visit here, I have to say I am thinking they are trained to act this way, because honestly it has been every single wait person we have had. \n\nMy last experience which I decided will be my last was a waiter who as I was paying him the check, leaned over and looked into my wallet and said to me \" I see you have a 20$ there, why don't you pay with that?\" Because I gave him a 100$ and asked for change! He complained that he would need to go make change and made a whole fuss about it ( it wasn't busy at all, we were his only table ) \n\nThen he huffs and puffs, walks away with my 100$ and comes back and shortchanges me about .75$. As the bill was like 27.25, he did not bother getting the change part back. Now I know it is only 75 cents and that is normally not a big deal, as his tip would of been around 5$ anyways, but hey it is the principle. If I am owed 75 cents, you give me my 75 cents! So when he denied taking it and just brushed it off as oh its only 75 cents, I decided that's fine, that's your tip, enjoy it .  Normally I would feel bad for not tipping properly, but he was a bastard the whole time we were there, and that was the icing on the cake. \n\nThere are SOOO many people out of work in our economy, how hard is it to find friendly people who want to work and make money? I don't understand how people who are LUCKY enough to have a job in this shitty economy can act like that and not care about their jobs."

Twice now at 2 different hotel restaurants have their corned beef hash plate been not hash at all!\nDiced/cubed corned beef is not hash. No way around it. Plus it's chewy like convenience store deli meat. \nThe flavors of everything else on the plate was good though. Hollandaise and the poached eggs was the savior of the plate. \nAnd to top it off, their side of breakfast potatoes are wedge French fries."

The menu at the Planet Dailies was perfect for the twelve of us as we were wanting everything from duck soup and noodles to congee to omelet and pancakes. We were always seated quickly even though our visiting tended to be between 6-12 of us. Our servers and food runners were all very attentive. The accuracy with our orders could have been a little better, though I also think some of us were being a bit high maintenance with the changes and substitutions! The restaurant is kept-up really well for being a 24/7 spot; the cleanliness was quite impressive. This place is a great late-night choice for anyone who tends to be indecisive what kind of food they want after partying.  Another bonus is that it's located next to a Starbucks and the Planet Hollywood casino is connected to the Miracle Mile shops, where you can also work on sobering up."

After wandering around we just decided to head back to our own hotel and eat there. \n\nWhat a mistake! It was just after 12:00 and on Saturday and Sunday, the breakfast stops at 12:00. They have some breakfast 'specials' available on the regular menu, but it was things like omelets with french fries. I just wanted an egg sandwich or something very simple, but no.... \n\nWe sit down, decide on what to have, and wait, and wait, and wait. Shockingly enough, I was getting very irritated. Servers are walking by and no one is stopping to take our order. We waited, and I timed it, 15 minutes for someone to come over and say, \"we didn't see you sitting here. How about I take your drink order and then find your server?\" \n\nMy response was, \"just take the whole order and don't find someone to else to help us. We've been waiting and you've been serving the table right next to us the whole time.\" \n\nI ordered water and a $14.99 grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, no bacon with fries. Dining companion ordered a Diet Pepsi and Reuben with chips. \n\nThen, after I complain the manager comes out and is bending over backwards, and a little too far at that, to help us. \n\nFood comes out and the grilled cheese was awesome, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nWe received the Diet Pepsi comped and 20% off, but think of it this way, if someone had helped us to start with, you would have made a whole lot more money. \n\nGo with caution, it wasn't even busy and now I know why. \n\nI gave it the extra star because that sandwich was so damn good. \n\nI just wanted my sandwich and to be left alone."

Plus, it's located in the casino area-- not through a maze at the back of the hotel-- easy access no matter where you are coming from on the strip.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the items are a little over-priced, but if you're on vacation, you're probably already making some splurges anyway.  My husband got one waffle with a little syrup (no fruit, no extra butter, nothing) for $10.  When you think about how much it would cost you to make one waffle on your own, $10 is a little steep; then, you consider that it's 3 am on a Wednesday, and it's not too terrible I suppose.  But then again, some items are about right, price wise.  \n\nThe service is fair; you can tell that some servers are sick of the night shifts, tired of drunk tourists, or just hate their job.  \n\nAlso, there's no restroom in the restaurant; only in the casino area, which is just outside the restaurant.   \n\nOverall, a good spot for late night or early morning meals.  They have a wide variety of items at a slightly higher price, but they serve it all 24 hours a day."

Be sure to check your steak's temperature...I asked for mine to be cooked medium and it arrived nearly well done.\n\nAs for the rest of the menu, the dishes are severely overpriced. My friend's spinach salad with chicken was $17 and it was tiny! Definitely not worth the price. \n\nOur waiter couldn't have been more disinterested in us or his job in general.

Pulling an all-nighter and being in desperate need of refueling, of COURSE that's the item that stood out to me. I wasn't really expecting much as the place even resembles a Denny's, but all in all, I was surprisingly pleased. No small piece of rubbery chicken doused in some ranch-like goo made it's way to the table. Instead, I received a hefty patty of crisp, hot sauced chix, sprinkled with a good amount of blue cheese crumbles. Not fine dining by any means, but it certainly hit the spot. It was a decent size too. I only finished half and took the rest back to the hotel before heading straight back out for more trouble-brewing.... but that's another conversation entirely.\n\nA few cons:\n\n- $15 is on the pricey side for a meal that probably shouldn't cost more than 10 bucks elsewhere. It *IS* Vegas, though. I suppose that's to be expected.\n\n- SERVICE. Damn. The guy was nice when he was around, but we barely saw him outside of taking our orders and when he brought the check. I understand we're eating at 4am, but this place is supposed to be fully operational 24 hours a day. Why oh WHY did it take 30+ minutes to get our food? And if we didn't ask another server to check on our orders, I wonder how much longer we would have waited.\n\nAnyway, I'd eat here again if it was a convenience issue (which it was), but probably not by choice because of the whole when-in-Vegas-eat-GREAT-not-good thing... Actually, on second thought, I take that back. I'll probably be back out of necessity. Thems dining options are slim to none at the crack of dawn. \n\nMmmmk, I'll stop rambling now."

I had breakfast and dinner here during my stay at Planet Hollywood. It's nothing the worst or the best it's a true definition of a three star location. \n\nATMOSPHERE\nThe location is on the casino floor and if your not a smoker you will notice the smoke and smell inside the location very easy. There is no separation between the restaurant and the casino its open space. The inside is very simple and basic with the seating and tables. They are standard size tables and seats both chairs and cushion bench.\n\nCLEANLINESS\nI was not impressed with the level of cleanliness I observed during my visits. The menu had food on it and sticky from prior guests. The smell of the smoke also made it feel not clean even if it was. \n\nSERVICE\nThe server I had each time was fine. They did ok and were nothing special. I could have gotten the same level of service from a robot. No personality, no food recommendations, and very limited follow up after the food arrived on one occasion. \n\nFOOD\nI had breakfast with eggs benedict one morning and it was served the proper way. The ham was slightly over cooked making it tough to cut with a fork. Bacon side I ordered was cooked crispy and tasted good. The eggs benefict aside from the ham was tasty.\n\nI had the breakfast platter one morning which included eggs, bacon. sausage, and pancakes. That was a good meal. Everything was cooked correctly and tasted good. I would order that again for sure\n\nThe breakfast meals come with potato wedges that are WAY OVER SALTED. You will need chapstick after eating some of those from the dehydration in your mouth the salt causes. \n\nI lastly ordered a burger to go and pot stickers around 4:30 am one morning as I returned to the hotel. The burger was not cooked to the proper temperature. The pot stickers were not flavorful at all. This mean was disappointing at best. No it was not from coming back at 4 am intoxicated either lol I do not drink alcohol very often.\n\nPRICE vs QUALITY\nThis location is a little pricey for the food you get. Breakfast for a single person will easily run $20-$35 per person. They charge for everything such as a super small children's size orange juice is $5 and soda's are like $3.99 I think. They do not even list the price on the menu for them. Simple side of bacon just a couple strips was the cost a meal $5.99 for 3 pieces of bacon lol. So they are open 24 hours and it's easy to get to inside the casino so it's convenient. However, if I was traveling on a budget I would not have eaten there."

Not more than 5 minutes later a table of four were seated. As soon as the waiter came over to take their order the gentleman stood up and started yelling at the waiter then had a few words with the manager and then took off yelling.

I liked it. Not a place I would go out of my way to get to, but if it's an elevator ride... and a drunken crawl away then hell yes! Blanking out the unsavory pre-late late dinner conversation I found that  the ambiance was typical kitchy Vegas with an unusual mix of culinary fare... between congee, chicken and waffles, and really good orange juice.. it wasn't half bad. It would actually have rated higher if not for the typically slow service one can find @ 4am. My bbq duck noodle soup was pretty damn good. The broth wasn't over seasoned and the noodles, though not what I had wanted because I can't differentiate between egg noodles and vermicelli, were just right. Wish I knew how to eat duck off the bone though but it being such a late late hour my eating etiquette was no where to be found. \n\nMany antics later I told everyone to leave money and for them to go to sleep while I waited to take care of the bill. The things that apparently I missed if I had only left with them is probably a short lived regret... considering the driver's license that was lost. In that time that I waited to pay for our time there.. i was able to find some solace in the whirlwind that is Vegas. \n\nAnd then I drank. \nAgain.\n;D"

I usually prefers neighborhood small brunch places, instead of glossy overpriced eating establishment serving the same brunch dishes but in Vegas Strip, you don't really have much choice.  \n\nAnyway, to be fair, the brunch selection here is pretty good. I got Croissant French Toast, which was four croissants flattened, then dipped in creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e batter, and grilled. Sounds good, right? Full point for uniqueness. It was good, but this got too buttery and oily the more I had them. My heart doctor would not approve this. So I recommend sharing this dish around the table. \n\nThe Breakfast Burrito was pleasant. Big serving. The beans and eggs were done perfectly, and the salsa was good, although I wish it was more tangy. I feel this has nothing special to warrant almost 16 dollars price but again, what could I expect in a big restaurant in Planet Hollywood like this?\n\nThe service was good. Lots of smile. Comfortable seatings. Prepare to pay around 13-16 dollars for brunch entree. \n\nI guess this place is as good as it gets.

My friend and I woke up late and wanted to grab lunch but couldn't think of anywhere else to go so we settled for this one. She said she saw this place was packed from the day before so she was curious, as was I. \n\nWe were seated as soon as we walked in as it wasn't that busy. My friend and I ordered Mango Mimosas to start, and the Chicken Marsala and the Lobster Omelet. Those $6 mimosas were the best mimosas I've ever had. They were SO good! Being that I was in Vegas and I wanted to be drunk the entire time, I was glad that I was buzzed after just 2 sips of the drink. It was so strong but it was so worth it. Thumbs up. Or rather, two thumbs up. Six if I had six thumbs.\n\nThe chicken dish had a really strong wine flavor, which was good (I've had chicken marsalas where I can barely taste the wine, blech). The poultry was nice and moist, and the mushrooms gave the dish a nice touch. The veggies on the side were nicely steamed as well. The egg dish was very filling; I love love loved the lobster - it was very chunky and moist. \n\nI think I loved almost everything that this place had to offer. Very generous portions, chatty and really friendly server, the different TV's all playing different shows and the atmosphere. The one thing I didn't like was the price. I thought it was quite expensive. Was it good value for the food? Not really. I think I would have paid less than what I paid for\n\nFor the atmosphere, taste and service, 4/5. Price, 3/5. Sadly Yelp doesn't offer half stars. My rating for this place would be 3.5/5 but since the price is what really stood out for me, I'm leaving it at 3/5.\n\nWould I come back? Probably not.

Richard and Bryan are particularly good: Friendly, attentive, etc. Richard offered to split one Oreo shake into 2 for the kids, because he thought a whole shake is too much for an 8 year old - right he was (even though the kids disagreed).\n\nThe one comment I would make is the wine selection. It's not great at all. It's also overpriced relative to the food which is fabulous value. They basically sell $6 wine for about $40. I get that the place needs to make some money, but if you serve that high quality a steak, please, please, please, have a decent wine on the menu."

It wasn't even busy when we were eating. Felt like they had to ask someone to tell someone to send someone in the back of downstairs to get our request!! Mann!!!"

The macaroni and cheese...mmmmm. Enough said. They gave me a whole large damn bowl full. Damn near ate the whole thing. Trying to give me a heart attack. haha \nThe salad was also served with fresh greens, not wilty, brown lettuce. \n\nOverall, not bad. A tad on the pricier side for what I thought was just a cafe though. This is Vegas. Aren't we supposed to be eating practically for free?!"

So much for me trying to eat cheaply in Vegas.  Oh, and no crackers for my soup either.  How can a restaurant  have no crackers on hand??  They did supply me with a basket of bread, which worked I guess.  My husband's steak was pretty good, but nothing spectacular there either.  The service wasn't slow but nothing wonderful either.

Hell yeah!\n\nI got in the early morning and was staying at the Planet Hollywood, and I am happy this place is located right in the hotel because I desperately needed fuel after an awful and uncomfortable flight.\n\nYou always worry about an overcooked steak, especially a steak that's only 7 ounces. Next, you worry about over cooked eggs. Thankfully, everything was perfect. The steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and well-seasoned, and the eggs were perfectly over easy with a runny yolk. I got rye bread, but it didn't seem like I did since I didn't get much caraway seeds. The bread was thick cut, which was nicely soaked up the runny yolk and juices from the steak. Now, if you'd believe, those weren't even the best part! The potatoes were amazing. I loved the seasoning, and the potatoes were fried to a nice crisp while the inside was soft. I wish I had more of it!\n\nThe service was very good. Out server was very attentive, very friendly, and spot on refilling our water. The food came out fast too.\n\nOverall, you can't beat a steak and eggs breakfast for only $7.95 anywhere, but a steak and eggs breakfast that is well-cooked, well-seasoned, and well-prepared with super attentive and friendly service? You can't go anywhere else! I wish this was available where I live. Actually, it is, but it's double the cost -_-.\n\nI'd definitely come back here even if I wasn't staying in Planet Hollywood on my next visit. Plus, this place is 24/7!"

Happily offering a true \"All Day\" experience inclusive of breakfast favorites straight through sandwiches and steaks to dessert it was with gluttonous eyes focused more on variety than the costs involved that I inquired about single serving options and after confirming with the cook that such an order could be compiled it was in a quintet that I partook, a bottomless cup of coffee never coming close to half-empty throughout my sixty minute stay.  Opting to proceed in two courses with the first consisting of three a la carte griddle favorites plus a decidedly dry cinnamon roll it was undoubtedly the eggy French Toast that shined the brightest of the selections and with fresh fruit toppings all made in house along with hand whipped vanilla cream I'd be hard pressed to suggest which accoutrement was actually 'best,' though the juicy ripe peaches and boozy bananas foster certainly made an equally strong case.  Undoubtedly a substantial order given the heft of the custard laden challah it was unfettered that I moved on to a choice of desserts and although the restaurant's signature carrot cake certainly warranted a second look it was in the 'Heaven n' Hell' style bread pudding that I placed my trust - the juxtaposition of black and white batons proving absolutely delightful with the former resembling a semi-set brownie while the later featured laminated layers soaked in butter and cream that slowly melted on the tongue."

He took a such great care of our table. Food was delicious too! My compliments to the chef...it was just simple breakfast, but I'm picky about my breakfast and they did it up right. Large portions and plenty of options. Probably the only downside was a table of loud and obnoxious kids that once we made a complaint to waiter, the manager spoke with them and they left. Prices were extremely reasonable. Looking for a breakfast spot in Vegas? Give these guys a try!"

The waitor was pleasant, and the food came out quicker than the wait, I don't know if I was buzzed from drinking earlier, starving, or both but the steak tasted pretty good. It wasn't the best cut, it looked pretty cheap. To be honest it looked like a typical steak dinner at grandma's house. Cheap cut, fat through out, and seasoned good. The portions were pretty decent for everything. I was able to get an 8 oz steak, mashed potatoes, mixed steam vegetables, and a seperate large container of a salad with mixed greens. The bill came up to 10.80 total. Still not bad for the portion size"

This time we were seated in a different area of the restaurant (it's a really large/deep space), and we were surrounded by wall-mounted TV's, all broadcasting different shows (some news, some sports, some entertainment).

Not to mention, I already had a huge headache from all of the previous night's alcohol consumption to begin with. \n\nWe finally agreed to give Planet Dailies a try, since they had such a vast variety on their menu. They had all sorts of dishes: soups, salads, Asian cuisine, pastas, sandwiches/burgers, breakfast, steaks, seafood, smoothies, and shakes. \n\nI got the Hong Kong Wonton soup, which was okay. It came with leafy greens and several wontons. The broth was nice and clear, but it wasn't as good as wonton soup from an Asian restaurant of course. It was the perfect remedy for the time being. I also got the try the chicken fettuccini and the spaghetti with meatballs. The chicken fettuccini was too dry and the Alfredo sauce was way too thick. On the other hand, the spaghetti and meatballs was great. It was a humungous serving that my friend could not finish. Luckily, she was nice enough to share. The meatballs were tender and abundant. The sauce was the perfect consistency and I liked it.\n\nThe food actually deserves three stars, but I've given them an overall two stars, for their incredibly slow service. The food took a good thirty minutes to come out and when one of my friends asked for an extra spoon and Tabasco sauce, it took the waiter 15 minutes to bring out just the spoon--he had forgotten about the Tabasco sauce. There were only two other tables being occupied at the time, so the slow and forgetful service was really unacceptable. \n\nSince they are open 24 hours, I would probably only come back during a drunken stupor, when I am feeling too good to even care about how long my food takes."

I think he forgot- then remembered that he forgot and told me he had to make it.  On a Saturday morning shouldn't someone be checking on things like how much tea or coffee do we have, and do we need to make more??  I think we had a new waiter. He didn't know what \"country scramble\" eggs are. After I explained it, he said all their eggs are fresh.  The eggs were not fresh cracked eggs. They definitely came from a carton.  \n\nWhen our food came my husband had one dry piece(no butter) of sourdough toast on his plate with his eggs. I had all my food on 1 plate- eggs, pancakes, potatoes, and a bunch of bacon scraps.  We didn't get any butter for our pancakes or toast so we had to wait for that. I wanted an extra plate for my pancakes so I didn't get syrup on my eggs-maybe I'm picky- but we had to wait for that. So my eggs ended up getting cold.   The plates are too small- my food kept sliding off it.  The salt and pepper shakers are grinders- so you get big pieces of sea salt and pepper- and you can't adjust the grind.  We also had to wait forever for our bill. \n\nI really think the manager of this place needs to sit down and have a meal here and fix these little things that can lead to an annoying dining experience."

Eggs are eggs, not many ways to mess those up but the potatoes and sausage patties were really good and tasty.  I had the Huevos Rancheros and I have to say, I was very pleased with the flavor.  Both dishes were decent portions.  I wouldn't advise sharing, you might leave hungry.  \n\nService was good, I was happy.  Kept our drinks filled, got our orders right.  Little wait and cheerful.

The service was just okay because our waiter never checked back with us to refill our water or see if we needed anything else til the end of our meal. Surprisingly everything on the menu is quite expensive. $40.00 for 2 breakfast entrees (no drinks) is ridiculous...it's eggs! I don't understand why all of a sudden people find this acceptable.

I've heard stories of the glory days of Vegas where meal bargains were abound.    Those days seem pretty much gone.    \n\nCue in Planet Dailies located inside Planet Hollywood.   We both eyed the $9.99 AYCE Pasta special.   Winner winner, not a chicken dinner!\n\nWe were greeted by our server Joey.   His mannerisms and voice reminded D of one of his favorite characters from Big Bang Theory - Sheldon.   So from this point forward, our server shall be coined SheldonJ.\n\nWe immediately placed our orders for the AYCE Pasta special.    SheldonJ explained the choices available...linguine, penne, or spaghetti for the pastas & meat sauce, garlic, and I believe a polonaise sauce.     I wound up ordering one of each pasta and tried all the sauces except for polonaise.\n\nThey were extremely busy which was reflected in the service.   When asking for water, D always requests having a lemon in the water.   SheldonJ bought waters back but without the lemon.   Before D could ask for the lemon, SheldonJ was off at another table.   We flagged him down a few minutes later and asked for the lemon wedges which took about ten minutes to get back.\n\nThe pastas themselves were really good with my favorite being the linguine with the meat sauce.   Another server was responsible for bringing the pastas out.    As I was enjoying the linguine pasta (which was the 2nd pasta that I ordered), I realized that there was no parmesan cheese to put on the pasta.    I flagged SheldonJ and he said the pasta servers usually provide the parmesan but he would go get some.    He never came back with it.   Rather than let my pasta get cold, I went without it.\n\nAnd subsequently on my 3rd pasta order I asked the server for some parmesan cheese and he said he'd be back and AGAIN no cheese.   As a funny aside they initially gave the 3rd pasta order to D (who only had room for 2 plates).   D jokingly lamented that because he's a bigger guy, they automatically assumed he was the glutton.   LOL\n\nDespite the lack of cheese (which actually they probably saved me a few extra calories...LOL) it wound up being a satisfactory meal and a great bargain for the price."

Yup, that's what happen. Now this was breakfast, eggs cool down quickly. We said something to the person that brought our food and when he came out of the kitchen with more food for another table and no utensils for us to eat with I knew it would be a long wait.\nI do not know if my food was served hot, by the time we received silverware my omelette was room temp.\nSimple Western Omelette, but the classic mistake was made. Minimal filling and all dumped in the middle.  1/3 of the omelette was egg only, 1/3 cheese, onion and green pepper and 1/3 everything including the ham (which had an excellent flavor)."

The main thing you notice is the many flat screens built in to the walls.  So many tv's, and which one to watch...  So, we came here on our first day in Vegas (5/21/08), and we both ate the Corned Beef.  Before when it was the Aladdin Hotel, the cafe served their Corned Beef shredded.  And it was REAL CORNED BEEF...  It was really good then.  Now, as Planet Hollywood, the cafe serves their corned beef CUBED.  It was REALLY GOOD.  Although my poached eggs was a little overcooked, it was still pretty tasty.  Hopefully next time, I'll keep my reservations and actually stay here in this hotel to take advantage of their meal coupons."

Seriously needs to be better if you want to charge close to $20 a hamburger. I know it's the strip but I feel more satisfied at Wendy's for a fraction of the cost. There are too many places on the strip to choose from that have better tasting $20 hamburgers and don't take all night to cook it either.\n\nBest part was the free wi-fi from Starbucks adjacent to the restaurant."

            "review": "OK, This place is fantastic. It feels miles away from the casino even though it is in the casino. We went at least 8 times in our 3-night PH stay. We loved the formula which reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory with the super-sized creative dishes. We finally made it to breakfast which is one of my complaints since they serve \"breakfast\" 'round-the-clock but the real breakfasts are only in the AM. Like more variety of omlettes and waffles.\n\nSo my big complaint is how we charged our 12:30 AM dessert and coffee tab to our room. At check-out my darling noticed our extras tab had a swollen total for that dessert visit. Don't mess with Meg. Our bill was $17 and we left a (fair) $4. tip. Especially considering the restaurant happened to be out of half and half (I went next-door to Starbucks and brought back some in a tasting cup) I understand a restaurant 86'ing on stuff but vanilla ice cream? Di had to have a hot fudge sundae with the only remaining flavor, strawberry. But for our waitress to give herself a $17 tip ON TOP of ours, I'm sure she must-have sized us up as guests who wouldn't nit-pick the tab. The tip was bigger than our bill.\n\nWe got the credit at the desk after Meggie produces our receipt and the next night I called the shift supervisor, Matt who was very interested in our situation. He offered us ONE free meal. I was disappointed in his gesture. \n\nBut we will go back for sure. Any place can have a shady employee and it barely affects my warm, fuzzy feelings about Planet Dailies. In fact, at our breakfast (10:45 AM) When our amazingly cheerful waitress actually read back our table order memorized, Di had never had a wait person do that before. She was really impressed. The food is high-quality fabulous. The atmosphere is great and their coffee is that kind we lust over. Real coffee shop coffee with that hint of chickory. We love that you can go right up to the counter with the stools in the middle of the restaurant and get coffees to go. Starbucks is too strong for my darling. So it would have been 5 stars if we didn't have that desperate waitress."

Had the chili, which packed quite a bit of heat, and couldn't pass up on the Chicken and Waffles!  I must admit I have not had it before, but having syrup and butter accompany a whole side of belgium waffles under a slab of Southern Fried Chicken, sounds overwhelming.  It goes pretty well together.  I'll judge against once I have something to compare it to like Roscoe's in L.A. or Southern food elsewhere.  Since it is open 24 hours, it is the go-to place for when you run out of dining options after midnight."

For the most part, it does its job with easing the stomach if you're starving after a night of alcohol (like myself) and if there's nothing else open.\n\nFor the food, it was mediocre at best and a little overpriced. I ordered the corned beef hash which wasn't terrible but for the cost, the portion was very small. Little cubes of corn beef hash really doesn't cut it for $16. However, the corn beef was flavorful and really made the dish along with the eggs. The potatoes needed a touch up on seasoning. Nothing some salt and pepper couldn't fix though.\n\nI didn't come in with high expectations and knew the possibility of tasting nothing ground breaking as I've been to many places just like this. Though small, the corn beef (meat alone) and the service earns this three stars in my opinion. The prices need some work for what you're receiving.\n\nBreakfast 12/12/2015"

Although Yelp had Earl of Sandwich (5 stars and cheap) listed as a hot spot we went for Planet Dailies instead since it was in Planet Hollywood where the show was. It was nearly empty when we went but then again it was midnight. We did however walk by the place before the show at 8:00pm and it still was pretty empty for a Saturday night.\n\nThese were the following reasons why a) I can't stop thinking about how disappointed I was, b) gave it 2 stars, and c) will never go back.\n\nWe ordered a Reuben sandwich, shrimp tempura, and a Caesar salad. We requested the shrimp tempura, being an appetizer, be served prior to our dinner. When the food arrived we received the Caesar salad and the Reuben first. We let the server, who was not our waiter, know of the missing shrimp tempura. He said he would check with our waiter on it. I was next disappointed in the fact that the Caesar salad was brought to me not chopped, but in huge \"leaf-like\" pieces. I suppose it's something new places are trying to make it more avant garde but I'm on vacation trying to cut my lettuce with a butter knife. The grilled chicken that came on the plate looked delicious but when I took a bite it tasted very burnt. The cross marks from being grilled were indeed black. The edge of the chicken crispy and dry. The taste was so unpleasant I did not eat anymore. A third server brought us our shrimp tempura and did explain that they know we wanted it first but it actually took longer for the shrimp tempura to cook than the other two dishes we ordered. The shrimp tempura was actually delicious and hot but at that point I really didn't care. When ever appetizer dishes are brought out after the main dishes, I always have this attitude like, \"Well I could have just not ordered it to begin with and not have to pay for it if it was going to arrive late.\" \n\nFinally, our actual server came by and apologized. I honestly felt the staff had been really nice... I think I just may have ordered the wrong things, they came out in the wrong order, and they were not the best quality... All of this confirmed by a $60 bill :( That is pretty steep considering we had lunch at Mon Ami Gabi in the Paris Hotel which offers excellent atmosphere, service, and the dishes are actually worth the $60 for a 4 1/2 star place. At Mon Ami Gabi they actually comped us dessert for serving me the wrong dish. At this place I only heard apologies... would have liked to see us comped for receiving our appetizer late. I feel a restaurant who delivers great guest service will do it without the guest having to ask. We honestly will not go back because there is something better we can compare it to for the same price."

It was around 11pm, and we just wanted a quick bite before heading to bed. \n\nThere's a wide selection of food on the menu, but that's probably why the quality was not good at all. It's not even that cheap either. My husband ordered the Western Omelet ($14.99). It was a sad looking omelet with limp looking fries and toast on the side. My husband almost never complains about food and hates to waste anything, but even he didn't enjoy this meal and left quite a lot on his plate. \n\nI ordered the Mac & Cheese ($14.50). The pasta was a decent al dente, but the cheese sauce was incredibly bland. When I reached for the salt and pepper shakers, I discovered a large wad of tangled hair caught on the opening of the salt shaker. DISGUSTING! The mac was mostly inedible to begin with, and seeing that wad of hair obviously ruined my appetite further. \n\nAfter the hair incident, we couldn't wait to get out of this place. They messed up our check and added an extra beer on there. It was a relatively simple fix, but that just dragged things out longer. Ugh."

She was cheerful and checked back frequently with us. \n\nI think she saw how tired I was and was really good with bringing me water ASAP. She was also really quick to refill our drinks!

No wonder it takes forever to order something lol.\n\nPersonal preferences aside, this time, I ordered a mini mac & cheese which was perfect and probably 2 servings worth. It was perfect.

I thought that this benedict combo of a corned hash dish with its poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, sprinkled with chives sounded bomb but nope. Diced potatoes were undercooked. The Corned Hash itself was drenched in grease. The Holladaise sauce was not the creamy savory taste you want in the sauce and the eggs were rubbery. Sad. \n\nMy other friends were very happy with their steak and eggs, french onion soups and chow mein however. Those may be better options. If you order the nachos, it can probably be shared between 4+ people.\n\nTOTAL REWARDS CARD! You don't get points but present it for a discount.

This was my first time and like every other first time, it was one I'll never forget. \n\nAnywho, we met these guys from Miami and they were staying at the Bellagio (which I will review later) and so, one of the guys wanted to take me to eat. I am not gonna lie, I was starving. \n\nThe environment is great. The hostess were friendly and I don't know if the guy wanted to show off or not but he topped one of them because he wants a booth. I ordered the Blackened Chicken Pasta and it was great!!! The garlic bread sticks were buttery and tasty as well. I forget what he ordered but they burnt his toast. Lol.\n\nOur waiter Gordon was very handsome and we could tell that he had a long day, so we didn't give him a hard time.\n\nWith that said, this is an awesome place for dinner at 5am in the morning!!!\n\nHope this helped!!!"

I absolutely LOVE the Croissant French Toast here! It's so soft, custardy, and heavenly!!! I think I prefer croissant french toast over regular french toast any day! Best part is that the dish doesn't contain cinnamon! WINNNNER!!! :) But yes, you HAVE TO order this dish, because it's just lovely :) You can order it any time of the day because its part of their all day breakfast menu, because it's THAT good. Also, it fills you up really easily, so you might want to share :) \n\nThe other dish I liked (not crazily good, but pretty good) is the loco moco! Rice, topped with seasoned hamburger patties, over easy egg, and onions(?).. I forget if there were onions.. maybe not, but it was pretty darn good as well!! \n\nMy friends tried their pasta dishes and said it was decent, so give this place a try! I mean, of course it won't compare to the 5-star $$$$ places you find in Vegas, but the food here is pretty good for the price!"

First off the service was very poor despite that fact that it was pretty empty. We were seated quickly but not given any flatware. Even when the food came out. The waiter never seemed to be around. Then the food came but there were no side plates for the kids. The calamari was good and my Teryaki salmon was very tasty, if not way over salted and over processed. However my wife's pad thai was pretty disgusting. Straight from a sauce bottle and not very pad thai like. They did remove that from the check but even with that removed the meal was very expensive and given the poor service not a good experience overall."

These are the two drinks on the specialty cocktails menu with the most alcohol (highly recommended). Although not served  in martini glasses, as listed on the menu.\n\nThe worst though, was the service!!! We were sat immediately and brought water, which was fabulous. But not by our server. Once a sever was assigned to our table he was at our table every two seconds to take our order. We take a bit to decide on main dishes, so we ordered drinks and appetizers and let him know it would take us a bit to figure out what we wanted for our main course. He came over at least once every two minutes to ask if we were ready to place our order. Once we received our appetizer, he came back another two-three times to ask if we were ready. We were so fed up as we couldn't even get any peace to figure out what we wanted that we just closed out our check!\n\nOn top of it all, we were for my birthday and everyone that dealt with us (the ladies at the front holding the menus, the hostesses, even the lady that brought us water) wished me happy birthday......except for OUR WAITER!!! It might seem like a small thing, but you'd think that the person your dealing with the most during your dining experience (your waiter), would wish you a Happy Birthday when your wearing a giant \"Happy Birthday to me\" pin! Especially considering the amount of times he came to the table!\n\nOnce we closed our check, it only got worse. We paid the bill and were finishing our drinks. We under-tipped him a bit for the terrible service, so I had the book with the receipt still directly in front of me. He came back and reached across the entire table to grab the book from in front of me while we were still sitting there!!! What waiter does that???????!!!!!!

Brandon was our server and all he did was hover around us. One of our guests showed up late and by that time we were asked a couple times if we need more time with the menus. After asking four times we finally gave in and ordered. Like I said good is great. Then it came time to pay. I always pay in cash and I was looking for the right amount in my wallet. All he did was hover until I gave him my check presenter. I needed change and while I was putting the tip in he again hovered until I was done. He lost money for that.

            "review": "Saturday Dinner @ Planet Dailies in Planet Hollywood\nWith the show, we got a small meal deal with it. We got a voucher for all of us to get 50% our meals at this place Planet Dailies. We didn't really know what to expect, so when we got there we found plenty of options. They have all kinds of food there, and it's all pretty decently priced, around $10-15 a plate, with pretty good sized portions as well. The waiter was really nice and he let us know that the asian noodles were really good there because the chef was in kind of a separate kitchen almost with his own little section and he barely speaks english. The food, therefore, was pretty authentic according to him. Having completely overlooked that entire section because we had thought otherwise, we thought it would be good to try. My friend decided to just go with a pastrami sandwich, which looked pretty good. It had really cool bread and lots of meat. Plus it came with fries. Looked delicious and filling. I was foolish and thought I wanted 2 dishes. I got both macaroni and cheese as well as beef congee (jook). Both were huge, and of course if you know me you could guess that I ate about 1/2 of one and 1/6 of the other. The macaroni and cheese was VERY rich. Delicious, but rich. The noodles were drenched in cheese, and there was a TON of it. The jook was good, nothing too special, but I don't really know how you can make that better than it is... I mean all it is is rice and water... it helped my throat, which was a little irritated at the time. Oh, and did I mention that the macaroni and cheese was GIGANTIC? Oh, I did? Well... it really was. But it was really good.. I wish that they sold them in small bowls, because that's really what I wanted... Anyway, my eyes are definitely way bigger than my stomach for SURE. Another thing that my mom got was the Hong Kong style won ton soup. It looked really good, but between my two dishes, I had 0% space in my stomach. My mom said it was especially filling because they had both the won tons and the extra noodles on the bottom. She said it was good though. Everyone seemed to like their meals there, and everyone got something different. Plus, the fact that everything was 50% off made it just that much better."

So we headed here, and we were not disappointed at all.\n\nIt took a while to decide what we wanted, they have so many choices on their menu (think Cheesecake Factory menu book).  Our server was super cute and friendly and did not hesitate to offer up suggestions.  So I settled with Lobster Fettucine and BF got the Club.  My dish was so good that I ate ALL of it.  And usually I'm done with fettucine halfway though since it's so heavy.  Planet Dailies version is far from that.  I didn't even need a nap afterwards!\n\nNow my BF's sandwich was a completely different story.  That thing was as big as my head.  Fries were thin and crispy (perfect).  There was so much meat on his sandwich that he ended up having to take it apart and take some meat off so he could fit the thing in his mouth.  \n\nMy BF and his friends ended up going back there late night, and he brought me back the kobe beef sliders.  YUM.  I would've preferred it to be less cooked (medium), but it was still good regardless.  Good spot to get some good eats!"

            "review": "Planet Dailies is like your traditional diner but with more options. This restaurant is conveniently located on the casino level of Planet Hollywood, which is why my friends and I ended up here since we were just staying a couple floors up. For a table of 8 at around 12:30pm, we were easily seated right away. \n\nThe menu offers extensive options ranging from breakfast to dinner to Asian to Italian. I had the Blackened Chicken Pasta for lunch and it was pretty good. The pasta was huge and was 2 portions for me. I also tried my friend's Pasta Carbonara, which was also tasty. \n\nI also returned to Planet Dailies late at night around 3am and ordered the Loco Moco. I was sadly disappointed with my dish. The hamburger patty was overcooked and just tasted burnt. I ended up eating the eggs with the rice and gravy. \n\nIt was nice that Planet Dailies was so convenient and opened 24/7. I would definitely come back if I was staying in Planet Hollywood and didn't want to venture too far from my room."

We have enjoyed our meal both times.\nIf you're looking for a quick bite to eat and/or lots of variety check this place out.\nI had breakfast for dinner and it was perfect. My mom and sister ordered the Rachel sandwich and they loved it. My aunt ordered a BLT with avocado and enjoyed it too.\nOur waiter was friendly and on top of things.\nI would visit this place again!"

            "review": "So they had this really random deal where you get $9.99 all you can eat pasta from 3p to 6p or something like that. Our server was Cody and I'd definitely describe him as toeing the line between quirky and goofy. The pasta was al dente, evenly cooked, it was OK. The 'garlic sauce' was basically this glazy buttery thing...kinda bland. We recieved our salad first, then our pasta, THEN our breadsticks (I think he may have forgotten to bring them out.) Bolognese was nothing to write home about. Coke was like $3.95 a glass. I don't know if I'd come back here. Received confusing directions to bathroom and I ended up walking all the way into the Miracle Mile Shops to the bathroom next to H&M to relieve myself. help me. ecetera\n\n3.5 stars. I agree with the other Yelper that they need half stars."

            "review": "We had a 50% off discount from tix4tonight that was recommended by the ticket agent after purchasing Britney Spears concert tickets. It sounded like a great deal but the food was just mediocre. Our ribeye steak dinners were cold and rare. The steaks did not have any sort of seasoning. Our calamari appetizer was drenched in sweet and sour sauce and hoisin sauce. The only thing good were the tempura shrimps. I would give them a one star but our server Melissa and the manager took care of us and did not charge us for one of our ribeye dinners. Perhaps try something other than steaks."

            "review": "The one star is for the staff. They are cute and sweet and very on top of it. However, this is simply the most appalling food that any restaurant has ever tried to serve me. It made Denny's seem like a visit to Fouchon. It is so nightmarishly over priced and so under developed. The omelet I had was filled to bursting point with a clear greasy liquid. My friends had sandwiches where the bread was just soaked in the same curious matter, and the chicken had the consistency of asbestos. And for this, an omelette was 11 bucks, and a sandwich is 13. The southwest scramble was filled with super cheap greasy chorizo and tasted like scrambled eggs with a canned sloppy joe mix thrown in, vegetables were frozen, of course. Shocking. This really is a new very dark development for Las Vegas. It used to be that you could arrive here and get a decent meal and a room for cheap so you could spend all your money on gambling. Now, everywhere you turn, you are being nickel and dimed and overcharged to such an embarrassing level that you simply want to go home and just spend your money doing something really fulfilling there. Planet Hollywood is so douchey that you may actually feel in danger crossing through the casino, it looks like a bunch of wife beaters hunting for their next victims. Skip this place AT ALL COSTS."

            "review": "This place is awesome! We had a fantastic server and they didn't mind that we brought in our own beer. I ordered the patty melt while my boyfriend had some sort of crazy sandwich that was like 4 inches tall. The fried were delish and you get your own personal ketchup bottle. While the food was a bit pricey (cost us about 50 bucks including tip) but considering that was the only real food we ate all day it was reasonable. I wish they had one of these close to me, but I will definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas. The menu is vast and includes manyifferent food options  (American, Chinese, Mexican, etc.) Just thinking about this place makes me hungry....mmm"

            "review": "First of all, let me say that they would have gotten 3 stars, but I took one star off for price.\n\nWe came in famished and buzzed around 12 AM.  Lousy 6 hour drive to vegas thanks to traffic.\n\nOur server appeared kinda slow.  At first I thought he was stoned because he spoke slowly and incoherently but he was okay for the most part...just a little slow with the check/he didn't stop by our table very often.  \n\nFood.  We started off with the buffalo wings, which I thought were okay.  Some were a bit small.\n\nI asked for the Hawaiian rib eye, and he said they were out.  in fact they were out of all steak except for the filet mignion.  wtf?  i like my steak w/ a bit of chew, and yea i know rib eye is a bit soft too, but i was tempted by the hawaiian part.  instead i opted for the Jamaican jerk pork chops.  very large side of steamed vegetables.  baked potato (hard to mess that up).  pork chops said they were marinated, but sure as hell didn't taste like it.  more like the grill with a bit of spices sprinkled on.  still it was cooked well, and wasn't dry.  two small but fat pieces of chops.\ni thought it was mediocre food at a high price (20 bucks for the chops).  it'd be better to go some place else, but i was staying here, and that was the only place open at the time.  \n\nbut i was buzzed and hungry so i ate it all up.  their fries were good.\nhad the 10% off coupon i got when i checked in.\n\nall in all, if you don't want to read what i wrote: overpriced mediocre food.  go eat at somewhere cheaper, and then play what you saved at a blackjack table.  21!\n\nopen 24 hours, like most casino cafes"

            "review": "My sister and I just ate there a few hours ago. Only because we were so hungry after watching a concert. \n\nWe waited patiently for our food since they were so busy. My sister ordered grilled chicken sandwich $14.00 with fries and I had ordered duck soup for $11.00... I thought the price for the sandwich was a bit too expensive, especially from a cafe style restaurant.\nWhen we got our food, my sister complained about the size of the chicken. The waiter said it was a 5 ounce...humm... more like a 3 ounce to me! It was so small it didn't even cover the bottom of the bread. (see photo attached to my review)\nIt looked ridiculous. I couldn't stop laughing!!!! I have never seen anything like it. And to think they would have the audacity to serve that type of low-quality food to a guest and ask for $14.00 in return? For a chicken sandwich? Wow! I would be so embarrass if I was in charge of that restaurant . \nMy sister spoke to the manager. He apologized and told her that he would give us 20% off the entire bill. What about 60% more chicken in that sandwich? Lol! We agreed to the 20%. The last thing you ever want to do is to send the food back to the back kitchen.  Needless to say, we will not be eating there ever again. Even if we were starving. \nAt least our waiter was nice, attentive, and very apologetic. I still left him a 25% tip. \nIt's not his fault that the restaurant he works for is CHEAP when it comes to quantity and quality of food. :("
