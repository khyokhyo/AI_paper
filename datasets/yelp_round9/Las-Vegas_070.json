A bit too much going on in the burger. I chose it though hoping for more flavor. My wife had the sliders and enjoyed them. They were good. It's a sport bar and it is great in that. Plenty of tvs for all kinds of events and they'll change it to your preference. Our server was friendly and we didn't wait too long either. I could've have ate twice as good at burgr, the ramsey place in the same bldg for about the same price. Just saying. We chose it because we were going to the zombie burlesque show after right next door. Would probably come back to watch a game."

They have beer pong tables and waitresses (not blondes) dressed in cheerleader outfits, quite interesting...\n\nThe food was not great through. I had the Philly cheese steak (which had one of the Blondie's specialties icon next to it) and the bread to steak and cheese sucked. There was a lot more bread then steak, wth? It was quite expensive, for simple American food. Also for water you got to get the bottled water, lol unbelievable. There's a lot of TV's for the sport lovers out there but I won't be coming back anytime soon."

My server watched me as I cleaned my own FILTHY table that we sat at. Argued that we didn't order a 2nd pizza & it took longer to get our plates than our 1st pizza. Don't ask for extras because you won't get them & good luck finding your server after she takes your order  (food runner brings your food) food runner had to get us our plates that we should have had before our pizza arrived."

We were seated quick enough and the atmosphere was nice. TV's everywhere, games, good drink specials. All of that was killed by the absolute horrible service. Our waitress took our orders and then came around twice before handing us our checks (our total bill came out to close to $100).   My beer sat empty , as well as two other drinks, for about 10 minutes before she noticed. The hardly ever smiled and didn't seem friendly at all. Then after she gave our checks and put our card she completely spaced out and came back with two copies because she split outlet our one order in two. Seriously? Anyways, it was disastrous by that alone. Food was mediocre to good. I suppose it could've been an isolated incident but since it did happen to me then it gets one star. Excel always."

            "review": "After reading the reviews for this place, I was a bit apprehensive, but we were short on time as we were departing Planet Hollywood and Blondies was staring right at us. I suppose it was simply good timing for us because the place was virtually empty and we received prompt, friendly service. \n\nWe started with the Garlic Bread Balls which were incredibly. Nice crunchy exterior, strong garlic flavor (which I enjoyed) and a soft interior. We polished them off in roughly five minutes. \n\nWe decided on a large Pepperoni Pizza and we had to have them take it back initially because we forgot to ask for it well-done. Usually, I get a sense of frustration from the server and / or chef when I have to send food back but the waitress was kind about it and understood and the chef (who brought us our pizza the first time) brought it back out with a smile. \n\nThe pizza tasted great. Perfect amount of sauce and the cheese used had a perfect sense of saltiness and it stuck to the pizza perfectly. The pepperoni tasted fresh and it was simply put, a good pizza. \n\nThe staff was polite, prompt and our waitress kept our drinks filled. The only thing that keeps this from being a five-star review is that it's a little pricey for what you get, but I was happy to spend a little extra for an experience like this. It appears my trip to Blondies was a bit more pleasurable than some of the previous visitors who have given their reviews."

My brother recommended the place a while back when I was in Vegas visiting and since then, I've always made a trip back to Blondie's.  \n\nI was in Vegas last month to celebrate a friends birthday and we came here looking to drink and play some beer pong at about 1 in the morning. \n\nWhen you walk in, you can tell that Blondie's is a sports bar.  College, NBA and NFL sports Team Banners hanging from the ceiling and walls. Waitresses dressed like cheerleaders and (noticeably) no male waiters, only bartenders. \n\nWe ended up getting a 64oz container of beer for only $35, which was perfect for beer pong, so we grabbed our cups, split up into teams (boys vs girls) and proceeded to attempt to destroy the boys. We failed, they beat us by two cups ... twice!\n\nWe stayed until 3 in the morning, a little drunk and very happy.  Good times all around!"

Also, we paid for $20 entry fee for unlimited draft beer, and then they only give you like 3 choices of beer, which were the cheapest beer. I ended up paying more because I bought additional beer. The beer pong was the only thing that got them the 2 stars, service sucks and deal was misleading."

They shouldn't be so cheap with their servings and learn how to cook better.  We couldn't see the mushrooms in the burger.  They were non-existent!  And I had more lettuce in my BLT than anything else.  I little bit more than 1 piece of bacon in my sandwich, please.\nThe only good thing I can say about this place is that there are a lot of televisions.  And when we asked if we could have a tv on a certain game, they obliged.  The servers were friendly, but I swear they had to have been tweaking on something.  I'm afraid to find out since some of them were so jumpy.  I really thought their boobs might fall out of their outfits.  Another good thing about this place is the deal for beer.  The server did point out it's cheaper to get 5 beers for $25 instead of getting single beers.  She knew we were there to watch football.  Good job, Tweaker!!!  \nSeriously, they need to get their food better, because it would be too easy to just drink when the food sucks.  And who needs more drunks in Vegas?"

So were lots of things.\n\nWhat's not good here:\n\nExpensive food that was just ok.\n\nMy meal didn't come out with the other three. I had to flag down a different server and ask about my meal. I guess our server was \"done\" with us.\n\nYou can't get a glass of ice water here. Well, you can but you have to pay for it. A bottle of water only, for several dollars! No tap water served here. No glass, no ice. Weird. Well, it's the \"water is a top commodity\" thing......\n\nOk, time to pay. Our hotel had given us coupons. We each had $10 off. We didn't want to do anything strange. We were just two couples who wanted to split the bill. Don't try this here. \n\nOur server would not, could not, did not split our bill. It had already been rung up she said and no way to change that now. So, we could only apply one coupon and she wasn't happy about that even as the bill had been rung up. She saw the coupons when we sat down but said nothing and did not take them. Had she perhaps not been in such a hurry to get back to her friends, maybe she could've paid more attention to our order. Then she went into her diatribe about us not having told her we were using coupons from the get-go, blah, bah, blah. Ok, whatever! We did, but whatever!\n\nIf this place wasn't so pricey for the rotten food (and no drinking water), we would not have wanted or cared about getting any $ off at all!\n\nShe said we could take it off her tip.\n\nWe did."

            "review": "We decided to go and try out their unlimited pasta. We were seated right away but no one came to take our order. I had to ask one of the waitresses if she could send our waitress to our table. After that she came moments later. The pasta is $9.99 and you have the option to add meatballs or chicken for $2.99. My friend got the chicken and I got the meatballs and we both ordered the alfredo. The bowl was a good decent size and mines had two large meatballs. My friend finished his first and wanted his second bowl; but then he was told if he wanted more chicken he had to pay another $2.99. We were shocked, and so he ate his pasta without chicken. We then asked for boxes and they said they don't give boxes when the unlimited pasta is ordered. I asked to speak to the manager and he really didn't want to give us boxes. I told him you guys are only going to throw it away so what's the big deal of letting me take the food that I paid for home. One of his responses was we should already know they don't allow boxes with the unlimited pasta and he even compared it to running a red light! He said everyone knows not to run a red light. I told him that's against the law and its written in the handbook. Nowhere does it say you cannot take the pasta home. So to end it he says I'll bring one box and runs off; he didn't even give me a chance to respond to him. So, I had to stuff both of our food into one box. Even though the pasta was good I'm never going back because of that experience and on top of that their food is overpriced. We should've just went to Bubba Gump."

We had been at the Miracle Mile Shops the day before and remembered there were many places to eat. We actually stopped at Ketchup first, but the employees had horrible attitudes and the menu was extremely limited. So off to find another place since we knew there were plenty of food places. And we ended up at Blondie's.\n\nWe walked in an the first issue was seating. There were plenty of seats in this bar, a frat boy's dream. We didn't sit outside since it's in front of one of the 2 theatres here and therefore quite loud. We went inside, but a man (we later found out was a friend of our waitress) leaning WAY back in his chair.  Then we moved all the way to the back room where the tables are made specifically to play beer pong. There was a group having fun and playing all the way in the back. That wasn't an issue until the table next to us decided (after we sat down) to move to the table behind us and start playing. So we moved again. \n\nFinally at a suitable table, our bubbly waitress came by and took our drink orders (don't order the iced tea, it's grossly overpriced). I ordered cheese sticks and onion rings and my sister ordered a steak quesadilla. They were both good, basic sports bar food. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nIt is a sports bar through and through, so remember that. Including the bathroom. Ugh (I only washed my hands). \n\nP.S. The Italian place next door looks lovely.

When we got there every item was $2 more than online.\n\nUpon walking in, she went to sit us out on the walkway, but we asked for inside to watch the game.  Then she took us to the back where many tables of rowdy and obnoxious people were playing beer pong beside our table.  We asked to go back out front, but in the meantime, the odd waitress \"yelled\" and I do mean yelled snidely at the beer pong people that their food was \"taking up her table\"....well, they were doing what they were paying a hefty price for... ordering bad bar food at hefty prices as well as wasting and drinking a lot of beer.  However obnoxious, they were the demographic.  That being said, I am not.  So unless you are currently going to \"keggers\" you need to find another dinner spot.  The food was horribly cheap and generic boxed food.  Three waitresses were having a disagreement behind the bar.  Two business suit pervs were feeling up the waitresses.    And while, the waitress who yelled at the other customers continued to not ever smile, she was actually working hard and efficiently, just minus any smile or happiness.

We waited an HOUR for her to come by the table for refills while we waited for our food, and when we asked her \"Miss?  Can we get refills?\", she replied \"Give me a second.\"  My more astute friend said to us at the table,\"We've given her *3600* seconds!  Did she really just tell me to 'give her a second?'\"  We actually thought that she may have been high or tweaked out, because her behavior was also quite erratic.  Sadly, I left a 10% tip, which I NEVER, EVER do, but the service was just that bad.\n\nThe food tasted okay, but it took us 2 hours to get three items, and the place was about 40% occupied.  \n\nThis place is AWFUL."

This place being a sports bar, maybe it was due to the fact that there was no good sports playing that day? The Buffalo Wings were actually quite good, the Cobb Salad was not bad, but the waitresses were useless, only performing the minimal amount of work their jobs required and lacked any sincerity or personality! Water is not free, you are forced to buy a bottle of their Blondies branded water. The washroom was disgusting! For a place that wasn't busy, more time should be spent cleaning the washrooms. This place was a BIG disappointment! \n\nTip for the waitresses: If you're muffin topping, don't work somewhere where you have to wear a tight cheerleader outfit!"

I was told to \"Hold on.\" And so I did, much to my dismay. When she finally looked up she said nothing, just stared. We asked for a table and asked how long the wait was. Honestly the place was packed and so I expected to wait, but the girl said \"I don't know there's a list.\" We had to ask to be put on it and she said \"What's your number?\" and then turned around and walked off. I wasn't even sure she had actually written it down. We went in to try and grab a beer at the bar, but the bartenders were rude and didn't care. One of the hostesses ran into me and then rolled her eyes and walked away. Mind blown.... \n\nWe found ourselves wandering into a seedy looking little bar across the way called The Stripper Bar. I thought we were about to go in for round two, but the service was amazing, the food was good, they were playing our game, they had better deals on drinks and our waitress did a pretty good dance on the pole at half time.

I can't believe this place gets away with this, being in a mall with upper class stores!  The paint on the flooring in front of the toilet was all worn away and greyish looking.  There was graffiti on the sanitary recepticle and no bag inside it.  Everything was dirty and worn out looking.  Yuck!\n\nI definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone and would not return.  There are much better places to try in Las Vegas!"

Blondie's is basically a Hooters that hosts beer pong games. Forget about the food, forget about anything else but beer and you'll be okay. Am I saying it makes up for their poor service and prick bartenders? Nope. But I'm just making a point.\n\nI went here last night, pretty damn late with a group of guys (a majority of whom were Marines). We went to play beer pong pretty much and that is what we did. The beer pong tables were pretty packed and everyone around us was having a good time. It was pretty loud and fun and all the people around us were nice (tossing back balls, joking, just having a good time). It was 4th of July weekend so we were all doing what Americans do... drinking beer and yelling about how much we love America.\n\nWould I go out of my way to eat here? No. Would I go back if I weren't with a bunch of Marines playing beer pong? No. But it's a fun time for what it is."

The waitress (pleasant and friendly) took an inordinate amount of time to wait on us, process our order and actually get us our food & drinks ( cold curly fries are NOT tasty). Overall, we were underwhelmed. Skip it. The waitstaff wasn't taxed by a bunch of full tables, the bartender was just hanging out and the two cooks/managers/delivery guys that dropped off our food appeared unhurried and laid back......so the problem might be managements approach to motivating the staff to move faster - and prepare BETTER FOOD !!

It was pretty empty for a Sunday night, probably because it is nestled deep in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood that are mostly closed that late. We ordered Mozzarella sticks and each got a wrap and a drink. The Mozz sticks were good, and the wraps were fine, but both were pretty expensive. The bill was almost $70 which I felt was a bit excessive for the amount of food we got. The wraps did not even come with fries. I'm sure this place is more fun with more people, when it's more of a bar than a late night restaurant.

I think she checked on us one time in the several hours we were there. We had to go to the bar to order more beers because she decided to sit in a booth in the back and fold silverware.

I expected it to be blah, since I checked the reviews of the place before hand. I ordered their chicken sandwich, which was grilled (and BURNT AND REALLY TOUGH/HARD ON THE ENDS OF THE BREASTS!) Oh my gosh! It made me full though, since I didn't eat anything that morning and afternoon. The only thing I ate good here was the curly fries (and the honey mustard...and definitely the dill pickle....and my unsweetened ice tea)\n\nOh btw.......you have to buy a small water bottle here...which is a $1...and they give you a cup with ice....\n\nThere is a happy hour from 4-6pm...$10 all you can drink Bud, I believe....They also have this HUGE pitcher of beer which is great for a group of friends...(forgot the price, but it's very affordable!) You can also play beer pong here too!\n\nThe waitresses were dressed in skimpy cheerleading outfits, which many were not very tasteful in. Don't eat outside unless you want to hear a load of noise during your meals, since it's right across from that performing arts stage with acrobats! It's a bit quieter inside, even if the sports games are on. It could get very LOUD though when there's a big game!"

            "review": "Having been given a $25 coupon to the Miracle Mile Mall restaurant (located within Planet Hollywood's shopping center), my husband and I went here looking for a filling yet fun dinner. The wait staff lives up to the Blondie's logo - female only waitresses sporting XXS cheerleader outfits, snug enough to showcase their tan stomachs and a hint of their bottoms. Forcing the feminist in me to get over the use of costuming and gendered employee selections (this is Vegas, after all), we made friends with our waitress, a Brazilian woman, and ordered water and sweet potato fries for starters, only to find out that the restaurant does not supply water but does sell bottles for $1 each. Typical Vegas nickel-and-dime tactic. The sweet potato fries were served with powered sugar on top and a side of honey - absolutely and unexpectedly delicious (the unexpected part based on the college-sport theme of the restaurant the constant advertisements for $10 all you can drink buckets of Miller). My husband ordered a Philly Chicken Cheese sandwhich, which was tasty yet quite processed and dry. My spinach, raspberry, and blue cheese salad was abundant in size and delicious, with plenty left over. Our choice of dessert was fulfilling: a rich brownie with ice cream and walnuts. \nHoping for a pleasant reprise, we returned to Blondie's the next week to redeem another restaurants.com coupon. To our dismay we saw a sign on the hostess station posting that the restaurant no longer accepts restaurant.com coupons, and when asked why, the manager gave us no reason. They offered us a 25% discount in trade, which would not even be worth it considering they charge just for water. \nGo to Blondie's if: You are dying to see your college team flag sported somewhere in Vegas; if you want some good sweet potato fries - only; if you want some cheap happy-hour beer deals; if you are more interested in foreign 20-something waitresses in skin tight, butt-cheek-revealing cheerleader uniforms. \nDon't go to Blondie's if: You want a good deal; if patriarchal marketing tactics offend you (though this IS Vegas...); you have kids with you; you want superb food at a superb price. And finally - don't go if you have a restaurant.com coupon! Jamnit!"

It was pretty spicy for someone like me that like spicy and it had a great crunch.

The appetizers were awesome full of flavor, I ordered a chicken Cobb salad & that was delicious. They give you your monies worth. The waitress was attentive, although they did seem short of staff (but that could of been because it was a weekday). I also had a great Frozen Strawberry Margarita or 2 haha! I usually don't like margaritas but the waitress recommended it & I was impressed. You can actually taste the liquor. It didn't take like a Slurpee from 7Eleven w/cheap liquor.

They have about 8-10 beer pong tables depending on the night. It's only a handful places left in Vegas that offer beer pong nightly. I highly recommned Blondie's as your official pre-game place!

We met a group of friends there as they were finishing up their mediocre bar food.  We sat at a tall patio table but were never acknowledged by the waitress.  Instead, she walked passed us many times but never made eye contact.\nI went up to the bar to order a beer and to grab waters for our table.  The bartender was friendly but he informed me that there is a minimum if you want to pay with a credit card.  Luckily I had cash to pay for my beer.\nI'm giving two stars instead of one, simply because the bartender was nice.\nOverall, a crappy experience.  I wouldn't go back."

We were so impressed with it that we bought another Living Social deal and brought our friends on Sunday March 24th.\n\nIt was packed due to a pub crawl, and I wasn't expecting to get very good service simply due to the massive amount of people. I was so wrong - Silvia was our server & I can honestly say she's one of the best servers I've ever had, anywhere. We all LOVED her!! I can't recommend this place enough & if you choose to go, ask for Silvia!!"

The man at the front entrance stated the fight was going to be displayed on the outside entrance of the bar, we waited on the outside for awhile, we were lucky enough to grab two seats, the two male bartenders were un-attentive, couldn't get a drink.\n\nThe black male at the front entrance later made an announcement the fight was going to be displayed on the inside of the bar, and since the demand to watch the fight was so high they were going to start charging everyone there to watch the fight, complete bullshit, they advertised online that the fight was free, we called in to double-check the fight was free, when we got there we informed the man at the front entrance we were there to watch the fight, he let us in then 30 minutes later tried to charge us? After we argued he said we were fine, that we were grandfathered in since we were there before they decided to start charging people.\n\nNow we were upset because we wasted 30 minutes outside of the bar to find a seat, when we could have been inside waiting for a seat. When we called earlier they said they didn't take reservations, when we proceeded to the inside of the bar there were 3 tables reserved, no one sitting at them to watch the fight.\n\nOnce again we were lucky enough to find seats on the inside at a table of 4 with only 2 guys sitting there, they were nice enough to let us share the table.\n\nOur waitress is the only reason there is 2 stars, I'm not sure of her name, but she was very nice, very understanding, and decently attentive for how packed the place was.\n\nThe food, we got a Chicken Caesar Wrap and a side of fries, the wrap was full of lettuce and very little chicken, I got 2 quarter sized pieces on my half, we assumed the chicken would be grilled as most are and instead it was deep fried. The fries were very soggy and greasy, they weren't bad though. The price on the menu for the wrap was $13 and some change, we got billed $16 alone for it and some change plus tax. Menu error? Waitress error? 2 Touch Pos system error? Who knows.\n\nNow right before the main fight starts, a waitress comes to our table and places a reserve sign on our table without saying a thing and walks away. We yelled to get her attention, she came back and said our table will be reserved for the fight, we said we were watching the fight, she told us we would have to pay for the table PLUS have to pay to watch the fight. COMPLETE BULLSHIT, I don't know who manages this place but you don't advertise a free fight on the internet, you don't tell people over the phone the fight at your bar is free and that you aren't taking reservations and then decide to change your mind, to charge people for the fight, to charge people for tables, and start taking reservations because the demand is high  to watch the fight, unbelievable. \n\nAfter arguing with the lady and telling her who we talked to and what they said, she went to confirm with him, came back and said we were fine. Not one person in this bar knew what the hell was going on, completely disorganized and chaotic. \n\nWhile watching the fight a man that was very intoxicated fell and hit his head on my barstool, he could have injured himself very badly, I'm not sure who his waitress was, but it was her job to cut him off long before he got to that point, after he fell and hit his head, he couldn't stand up on his own a friend had to help him, even after that, he still didn't get cutoff. If this place continues this type of service they will lose their liquor license.\n\nThe only reason I would come back here is because our waitress was so nice, other then that management needs to get their sh*t together, that's not how you run a sports bar."

Since I don't drink - sadly the cheap / all you can drink beer was a waste on me. I'd bring a crew here for sure.\n\nI went to Blondies to view the UFC fights (Go John Jones!) - cover was a bit overpriced $40! BUT I forgive that for the cheap beer - again, wasted on me - but I can see how paying $40 cover + $20 = damn good night for some folks. \n\nAtmosphere: What you'd expect from a sports bar - loads of TVs, etc. If you have a big group you can \"buy\" a big booth with primo viewing to the screens, if youre a small group or solo - there's plenty of seating available.  The people in this place range wildly - you are in Vegas. I found mostly friendly sports-watching-having-a-good-time people. \n\nFood: HEARTY portions, and surprisingly pretty good. I had a BLT and shared some onion rings, both of which were not greasy and overdone - but tasted fresh. Even the toasted bread on my sandwich was fresh. \n\nService: Decent. I was happy that the girls in cheerleader uniforms weren't so boob-a-licious that it was annoying. They were cute and friendly, and bless them for having to run around with pitchers of beer serving half distracted sports watchers. They were fast, I didn't wait forever, and there was enough of them that i never had to flag one down.\n\nOverall - better than Buffalo Wild Wings for a little in-hotel Vegas sports action."

Please read to avoid a similar horrible experience. \n\nHad a beyond horrible experience here. Came to watch an NCAA game this past Saturday with a group of 5. We got there and the service was horrible. We basically served ourselves by going to the bar to get drinks. The waitress didn't start paying attention to us until she realized we were ordering a lot of drinks and would have a big bill. \nHere comes the fun part! Someone on my team got hurt and was on the floor. The opposing team's fans at the bar yelled stay down to a kid! So of course I said that's rude and they proceeded to start a chant calling me an \"ahole\". Fine I let that one go. Towards the end of the game when the other team clearly was about to win the same fans started the \"ahole\" chant again for no reason. So I asked the manager if he was going to let that happen at his bar and he said \"this is a sports game, get over it.\" I said ok I understand that but are you still going to accept this kind of behavior and bad environment at your bar? And he said yes. So I left the bar. My friends went to go talk to him and he said rudely \"you don't talk, I'm talking.\" Who says that as a manager? His demeanor in handling this situation was rude and demeaning.  I get that it's a sports game, but he should not one that kind of environment at his bar or treated customers that way. I don't know what his problem is but I did complain to upper management and I hope they will handle the situation accordingly. \nUpper management was very gracious when I told them my situation and I appreciated that. As for bar management HORRIBLE! I don't know how he got this gig as a manager.  As an FYI it was an older man that was the manager on duty for this instance. He could care less about customers and only cared about himself.  No respect for other human beings what so ever. \nSo if you want to watch sports somewhere where they actually care and respect you as a customer, do not go here. I'm sorry to say this after speaking to upper management but other customers deserve to know what a bad environment this is."

If there's an open seat available at the bar, you better take it.

The floors here are bare concrete and the chairs have metal legs so anytime you move one it sounds like very loud nails on a chalkboard, starting off on the right foot. Get inside and the place is basically empty and the hockey game is on a big screen right in front of us which is nice. The waitress comes around maybe five minutes after we sit down. We order water and guess what they only serve bottled water! Can't imagine how much bottle waste they must have to deal with on a day to day basis but I'm sure they love that extra $1+ they get to charge everyone. And its not like were talking Perrier here you are just getting a generic plastic bottle with their \"brand\" on it. We ordered some wings they didn't come out  for a decent amount of time. When they did come out they were pretty far past  \"Meh\" on the universal-wing-scale.  Wait staff didn't come by the rest of the meal to offer us more bottles of water. Had to flag them down to get the bill and get out of there. Basically, if this place is this slow and painful on a slow Sunday I can't imagine what it is like when it is busy. Also, any place that charges you to buy bottled water rather than serve you tap better be amazing and serving you water synthesized from hydrogen gas and oxygen in their custom reaction chamber."

We all had ordered some other things including wings and the garlic fries, as well as chili cheese fries which were all great. However, the problem lies on the service. Our servers name was Jessica. She arrived at the table shortly after we were sat and we waited roughly 10 minutes just for our waters while she was busy talking and charging her phone. After our food order was put in (which was before our drinks had even arrived) we did not see her again for another 15-20mins. I had to get my water refilled at the bar because she was no where to be found, which was odd because there were only a few other tables sat and multiple servers around. Once she finally came back we asked for our checks, which she printed then stood talking to a non ordering table for an extended period of time when we were waiting to leave.

The piece of meat was thin and small to begin with (thats fine) but they over fried the steak. And they served it already cut down the middle (as if they were checking if it was done). The gravy came on the side and looked soupy. Almost Man sauce like. \n\nI almost felt like  the restaurant cook wanted me to get on my knees and dump hot gravy on my face.\n\nMeanwhile we are in a sports bar right?

I was unfortunate enough to stop by with my son that just turned 21 on this day and we sat at the bar.  A young lady (bartender not cheerleader waitress) asked what were we drinking, I ordered a shock top and son ordered a beer as well.  She asked if we were eating and we said no and she got a grouch look on her face and turned away.  She plopped our beers down and that was it.  She later gave us our check but during our drink we decided that we wanted to grab some food.  We asked the lady for a menu and she gave us one.  We waited 20 minutes, while the whole time we see her talking with her friends, drinking starbucks and doing nothing.  She eventually came and said oh what did you want to eat.  I was furious, I said we waited 20 minutes and that was crazy, asked to speak with a manager, she said she was the manager.  I find that hard to believe.  She said, \"well you originally said you didn't want to eat\"  I said, \"well I thought I made it clear 20 minutes ago when I asked for menus and said we decided we wanted to eat\"\n\nShe then proceeded to tell us that a girl was on break and she was swamped.  See above on my comment on what she was doing the whole time.  I said was it because the way I was dressed.  Sleeveless shirt, basketball shorts and sunglasses, she got defensive and said no.  Well trust me, I had money to spend and lots of it, but I refuse to go anywhere and beg for service.  The kicker was I paid 20 dollars for two beers!\n\nI strongly suggest to avoid this place and try the gazillion other establisments in Las VEgas."

When I say packed I mean they should have a maximum capacity limit which they clearly ignored. Every table was taken, and they had chairs set up in every other open floor area which were also all taken. People were literally eating pizza off of the floor due to lack of seating and tables. \n\nThey also didn't tell us that \"all you can drink\" meant ONLY bud light. My friend doesn't even drink beer (gluten intolerance) so it was a total rip off for her. Bud light is not my drink of choice, I would have rather had a cheap well vodka with soda.

So on the way over to Blondies, I call to make sure there's still space available, and am told there is, but the cover is now $60.....hmmmm. Okay. Still not terrible since it includes drinks. Well, then we get to the front to pay our entrance, and are now told it's $80!!!!!!!!!!!! I explained that I had just called minutes ago, and was given the $60 price. They didn't give a crap. Bottom line (it's Vegas after all) is to make money. The guys working the front were fairly rude, which makes it even worse when handing your money over to them. \nWell we decided that since we were already there, we'd suck it up....and pay. I didn't want to use all my cash so I proceeded to pay with my debit card. Oh darn, they only take cash!!! So one of the rude guys tells the little waitress to show me where the ATM is located in the restaurant. She takes me right to it, and then I turn around and she's gone???!!! So I get my money, go back to the rude goons at the front and stand there FOREVER while they just ignore me. Then it hit me, Hey, I'm in this joint. You want to be rude jerks?? Okay, cool. Me, and my money (safely back in my pocket) are winning this round. I found my boyfriend inside and drank PLENTY OF FREE BEER, and watched the fight. For nada, zip, zilch!! Ha Blondies, suck it. I win. \n\nThe money I didn't spend here, I spent the next day at the Pub at Monte Carlo. Way better place to watch sports, and have all inclusive food/drinks. No surprises on the price. When I called I was told $40 all you can drink....when we got there,$40 all you can drink!! This is on Sunday's btw. So you can post up and watch football and have a GREAT time.

Well, you go to the bar for that and when you need a refill you go back to the bar, she took care of food orders. Ok so we ordered some food and went and got our first rounds of drinks. Bartender was a little sarcastic but hey so am I. Second round of drinks? Not so quick and more attitude from the bartender. 3rd round? We had to wait in line at the bar and bartender was, dare I say it, a little ruder still. By the time we felt as though we had gotten our money's worth, we had worked pretty hard for our beers. In addition, our waitress came to our table and asked if she could give us our bill as her shift was over. We were all done eating so no problem. Well we sat there another hour and a half and our waitress was still helping other tables, giving us the impression she didnt have to leave but just didnt want to tend to our table any more.

She told us it is posted until noon each day even when no one can order that special after 11am.

You get your choice of THREE toppings as well as cheese - I opted for Avocado, Blue Cheese and Bacon -  and skipped the extra cheese.\n\nIt was interesting though when our bill came because they waitress told us the beer we were drinking was \"not included\"... even though we told her we had the bands, and wanted to \"try\" the best beer AND the host and hostess specifically told us come in for $10 DRAUGHT beers, and the menu said $10 DRAUGHT beers - so maybe there was small print with that but if we have bands, and we are drinking anything BUT what is included, you would think they would question it.\n\nAnyways - They were nice enough to drop those off our bill becuase it was clearly a misunderstanding by all parties.  Because of that, they get an extra star!

We were so hungry, and wanted something that would cost under $20 a person, so we came to blondies. \nWhen we arrived we were promptly seated, and given menus. We weren't ready the first time the waitress came around, so she left, and we waited for a good 15 minutes for her to come back. Finally she came and we ordered. My mom and were feeling the same thing, grilled cheese and tomato soup. So we ordered, and we waited. We waited at least another 25 minutes, but mind you, when you are super hungry it feels longer. \nDuring the wait, I needed to use the restroom. Somehow I didn't see the restroom sign, so I went and asked the hostess. She was startled when I approached her because she was in her phone. After seeming annoyed, she showed me where it was. \nThe first thing I noticed about the bathroom was that it was very dirty. I actually waited for a different stall, because the only other one available had urine on the toilet. When I went into the other stall, it was of mediocre cleanliness. It wasn't as awful as the last one, but it still smelled awful and there was toilet paper everywhere. I felt dirty after leaving that restroom. \nAfter leaving the restroom, I go back to our table where our food has finally come. The grilled cheese was luke warm, and I'm not even exaggerating! There was a single slice of cheese, and it was only half melted. My mom brought this to the waitress' attention, and even she agreed this was unacceptable (Especially after waiting SO long..) She took it back, and brought us menus to order something else. \nAgain, after this she was gone for another 15+ minutes!!!!! When she finally came to take our order, we just ordered two apps to share. We ordered tacos and chicken strips, and at $12 or $13 for chicken strips, they didn't even come with fries!! OH well, its vegas right? So we ordered and continued to wait. Again, after ordering the second time it was at the VERY least another 25 more minutes until we got our food. I asked for some extra ranch, and that alone took 10 more minutes. Mind you, I didn't mention that they were so slow when we were there so I am not sure what was going on. \nThe ONLY good thing about this experience was the food. The chicken strips were hot, and so tasty and the tacos had just the right amount of spice to them. My mom said the tacos were luke warm, but I thought they were fine. I mean the meat inside was hot, can't expect the lettuce and other fixings to be hot. \nI wish I would have remembered our waitress' name, because even though the service was slow, she was super nice and very apologetic toward us, and even took $7 off of our bill so that was a plus. \nAfter all was said and done, we were there for the better part of two hours. It was kind of ridiculous, but we left full finally. I'm just glad we didn't have plans or anything after cause we surely would have missed them\n\nAlso, for what its worth, not that I care, but none of the waitresses on staff were blonde when I was there, not one!"

The server chick we had was pretty attendant to us considering how packed this place was for the fight.  We paid $100 a head and got seats and our own server while a lot of other people paid $60 and I believe they had to go up to the bar to get their open bar drinks.  I really thought we'd all get a lot more drunk since we all threw down $100 each, but I'd say on average out of our group of 11 dudes, we probably only put down about 3 beers and a shot each.

I went to \"BLONDIES\" after a late night wedding in Vegas and it was to die for or from in the literal.  \n1) It took forever to get service and food (people that were seated after us were eating before us) 2) One of the individuals in my groups order was not correct 3) The one thing I order a baked potato was cold and old 3) The manager could careless and he let us know it from the response he gave my friend.  \n\nWhen it was all said and done, I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt! So, I took matters into my own hands and said to myself maybe a different approached and a different manager would bring so much need light to the situation.  Nope, I will say at least the other manager attempted to listen, until the rude and disrespectful manger decided to interject with his ignorance (adding fuel to the fire).  As a result, of being completely disrespected and devalued as a customer, I decide to attempt to contact the owner (no success, however not surprised), and finally I decided to write something to caution other travelers not to waste your money at a place like this, when there are other great and fabulous venues in Vegas worth the money.  I refuse to spend my hard earned money at place that could careless how customers are treated.  The staff is a reflection of the management and the management is a reflection of the ownership.  There end is the problem no accountability and employees are allowed to treat customers less than civilized.  They are one of the only establishments open late on Miracle Mile and thus they could careless, plus they aren't about building customer loyalty. \n\nGood Luck if you dare to Dine there!"

If you have had a few to drink and want some great food come into Blondies and enjoy a good meal.\nTheir are tv's in every corner, so you won't miss a second of the action. There are 4 beer pong tables that you can enjoy and possibly get over your buzz. \nThe best thing is that the food was fast and the service (waitress) was outstanding. \nSo cone by here at the end of the night and enjoy some good food.

I liked the idea of a girly sports bar as a girly sports fan and I dug the waitress and hostess cheerleader uniforms as a former cheerleader. It was cute and seems like a great place to catch a game and a beer. It's a little small but they have a ton of TVs (as one would expect in a sports bar!) I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato for $10 and it didn't come with fries. What kind of restaurant serves sandwiches without fries? For $10!!!!! My cheese wasn't melted all the way so the sandwich was doomed from the second I laid eyes on it! My husband got a turkey club. It was nothing special but again, no fries came with it and it was around $13.\n\nWhile they weren't the worst sandwiches we have ever had, we feel as though the place is a complete rip off. Though, most places in Vegas are the same way. We were just extremely disappointed."

We were actually attempting to get to the Hawaiian Tropic restaurant.  The girl in front literally looked at me and was like, \"Um, you're in the Miracle Mile... in the Planet Hollywood.\"  HELLO, DUH!   I said nothing.  So, tired of wandering and having food smells lure us in, we decided to eat at Blondies.\n\nThe waitress seemed fine until she started talking.  L was feeling like a beer but the selection sucked- at a sports bar- wtf.  When she asked the waitress if there were cocktails or a wine list she told us that there was ONLY wine and that it was limited to the house red or white.  Too bad there was a full bar inside that I only noticed after ordering!!!!!!!!!!   Strike ONE.\n\nStrike two- she neglected to ask me what kind of cheese I wanted on my chicken sandwich so I got NONE!  I was so disappointed as I am a total cheese freak.  After bringing these matters to her attention she said she would have the manager give us a discount.\n\nStrike three?  The discount was maybe 2% (like a dollar and some change) of the entire bill.  I guess the gesture was nice and all but if it was such a silly amount it was pretty much pointless.\n\nThey put powdered sugar on their sweet potato fries which sounds ok in theory but doesn't work when they're a side to a burger.  It's also quite pricey for average food and terrible service.  Yeah... no."

Other than its proximity (it's basically in a mall within Planet Hollywood), the bar itself is awesome. \n\nThere's plenty of TVs with sports, cute waitresses who are quick to take your order, beer pong tables and relatively cheap beer prices. We had a group of about 20 in Vegas for March Madness and we were all thoroughly impressed (this was our second year in a row coming here).\n\nThe only downside (outside of proximity) is seats are limited and it's a bit of a shark feeding frenzy when it comes to finding a table.\n\nThe wings were awesome.\n\nIt's a young crowd here, so if you're over 40 or so you might get annoyed by the volume and drunkeness of its patrons."

I'm not sure if the management had changed since last year, or if we were just lucky, but everything was great!\n\nOur server, Gabby, was so sweet and attentive.  We weren't through with our drinks (soda) and she was at our table with refills.  Always smiling, too!  We ordered various appetizers-potato skins, onion rings, wings and nachos.  Everything came out in a timely fashion and was piping hot and delicious!  Gabby came back to our table to check on us many times while we were enjoying the food.\n\nNo complaints from us, in fact, we went back a second time during our stay, and Gabby was our server again....Yay!  She was just as great as the first time.  Thank\nyou for a very nice experience!    In my world...good service equals good tips!"

Basically, it's a Hooters with girls in cheerleader outfits instead of the skimpy Hooters outfits. \n\nIt's a sports bar with sports bar kinda foods. How can the expectations be that high? I don't get it. Huge TVs everywhere, bar, wings, finger foods. \n\nCame here twice in a weekend. Both times, there was no issue with customer service. Both girls were super friendly and helpful. There wasn't a lag in service at all.\n\nI really enjoyed the sliders here. No high expectations or anything. Wings weren't bad. Sample platter was all fried, what do you expect? They include FRIED mac and cheese balls. Delish! \n\nAlso, if you're a Total Rewards member, you get 20% off! Awesome!"

I asked to be transferred to ANYONE else in that establishment...she said there was no one there, she would have to take a message and have someone call me tomorrow.

I call back again she says, \" I'm f*cking busy and can't deal with this sh*t\", and hangs up.

At this point I am livid, en route to Blondie's and instead of tasting the food there I am about to smack the taste out of Jen's mouth. I call back the manager finally answers, talks to me and apologizes. ( I guess Jen is not the one woman show). At this point I am standing in front of Blondie's listening to her on the other end of my cell phone. The damage done is beyond reparable and for whatever reason I still walk in order a soda.

The first meal they charged us 2.00 for each vegetable added to the pizza when the menu said 50 cents. They did correct it but blamed the computer. This morning they charged me an extra 1.00 on an egg I had added. Again they tried to pass the buck by the floor manager. I just want people to watch as this must happen all the time.\n\nAfter this response from the manager I had to respond:\n\nComment from Von M. of Blondies Sports Bar & Grill \nBusiness Customer Service\n12/10/2016  Menu never said .50cent per topping and the toppings for the big 16inch pizza are always 2.00$ also an extra side is $1 that is correct ... eggs arnt free sorry . Takecare \n\nVon M\n\nWow! I'm appalled at your response. I don't appreciate you insinuating we lied on our review. As we went to the hostess stand each time and reread the menu to check pricing. For your information we ordered a SMALL pepperoni pizza and added 3 vegetable toppings as the menu said each was 50 cents per topping. The Pizza was not a 16\" like you referred to. When we got the bill we were charged $2.00 per topping. We checked the menu again and it stated 50 cents per topping. The waitress also checked and told us we were correct.  The next morning we had breakfast and ordered one egg with our meal (I know they are not free) and again was charged $1.00 more than what was stated on the menu. Again my husband went to the hostess stand and checked the menu and sure enough we were charged an extra $1.00 more than what was stated on the menu. We had the same waitress in both situations which it appeared she was somewhat embarrassed knowing that this was second time around for us.\n\nI suggest that you get your menu to correlate with your computer and maybe that would solve a lot of your problems. Judging by the other yelp reviews you have commented on, you have done a good job showing your rudeness. My suggestion to you is that if you can't take the heat of \"yelp reviews\" you need to get out of the kitchen. In other words get another job.  It might save you the trouble showing how you react to dissatisfied customers."

Once someone finally came she took our drink order which we didn't see for another 30 minutes. Finally we ordered our food and they brought us the wrong order. After taking it back to the kitchen and waiting 15 more minutes we were brought the wrong food AGAIN. Did I mention if we wanted more drinks we had to walk up to the bar because we never did see our \"real\" waitress, since the only one we saw kept giving us excuses about how she was so busy (this place wasn't full AT all). After asking for the manager we kept getting a waitress telling us she was the best we were going to get. The manager finally came and again, excuses. I will never dine here again."

That should have been a sign.\n\nDrink's: Yikes, over 10 minutes for any kind of greeting by our server, and another 10 minutes to get our 3 bottles of beer.\n\nFood: I've had better, but it was not horrid. We waited another 20 minutes to order our food, but it came out in probably 8 minutes (Which makes we wonder when it was actually cooked/prepared). We had no forks/napkins, and would not get acknoledged until our meal was about done. \n\nPayment: I complained (we were at an hour 30 minutes now). They gave a small comp (which is better than nothing) and even was greeted by the manager (who never actually said he was a manager). After that, I just walked to the bar to pay, because, well.. I was tired of waiting.\n\nOverall: Poor service. Medicore food. I would not ever eat here again. They need more staff, and possibly get rid of them beer pong tables.

Granted it's bar food, but I like bar food and the atmosphere is nice. We had tickets to a show at the V Theater and a Groupon came up for Blondies. So it was perfect. Eat, then walk a few steps to our show. We were seated immediately. Our waitress gave pretty piss poor service. We are not extravagant people. I don't need you to kiss my ass because you're serving me food. I just ask that you refill my water, and get me my food when it's ready. This waitress was bottom of the barrel. It took her forever to get our order...after walking past us telling us she'd be right with us. She then explained how it's been soooooooo busy and short staffed. I'm human, I get it. No worries. However, she was off doing god knows what and I see a guy in a t-shirt (a bartender, a dishwasher) I don't know who he is. But he kept running all her food. Um, ok. She's just walking around like she's got nothing better to do. Also, I'm pretty liberal. I don't care if you have tats over your damn eye lashes BUT sometimes what you wear does not go well with your \"art.\" She was covered in really bad faded tats wearing a cheerleading costume. The hostess was gabbing with two friends who came in for applications. She would gab with them. seat someone then back to dishing about how great the job is. UGH. Unprofessional. But the food was good, when we finally got it. Nice girl, but slow service. Overall, with a groupon or a comp or desperation would bring me back. But hopefully none of that is likely. \n\nI have never had their alcohol I can't speak to that or happy hour specials."

Even if you don't have a Groupon, Blondies advertises the best happy your in Vegas: All you can drink (beer or well drinks) from 3-6pm or 10pm-1am, excluding game days. Blondies is located inside the always busy Miracle Mile in Planet Hollywood. It's a great place to catch a game compared to other pricier places on the Vegas strip.\n\nMe and my lady friend went in on Friday, January 17 and we're expecting a wait but it was pretty dead for 10pm on a Friday night. Blondies has some serious square footage and there's a plethora of sports memorabilia and flat-screens littered throughout the bar and grill. We were told to seat ourselves wherever we wanted and we headed towards the back bar. However, we quickly made our way back to the front bar after the bar tender informed us she was closing up.\n\nAfter seating ourselves, a server was quick to tend to us and we let him know we had the open bar deal. He went on to put a bracelet on us and began serving us well drinks. Simple vodka and juice drinks. The first drink was nothing to brag about. I felt like I was drinking expired cranberry juice while my girlfriend drank orange juice. I knew then and there we were not going to get drunk. Five drinks (each) later we were exploding from a big dinner and tons of cranberry and orange juice. Not even a buzz. We decided to call it quits and take our loss. \n\nI think my biggest gripe is the inconsistency in drinks. The bartenders were great guys but one was making us real drinks while the other was serving us juice. Regardless I was nice enough to tip every time. The TV at our bar was playing an old UFC fight and my lady was forced to watch some guy get his head and nose bashed in while we drank our watered down drinks. We could have asked to change the channel, but didn't feel like bothering our bartenders. I'm sure this isn't a bad place by any means but I'll have to dispute their claim as the best happy hour in Vegas. \n\nAmbiance/Decor: 3/5\nFood (Drinks): 1/5\nService: 3/5\nPrice: $$\nOverall: 2/5\n\nPros:\n+ Full bar\n+ Open 24 hours\n+ Drink specials\n+ Lunch/dinner menu\n+ Cute hostess' and bartenders\n\nCons:\n- Open bar drinks vary in strength"

But, even if the food was awesome, a resort fee is a spit in the face of your customers, it is so insulting that I can't go back. \n\nNever ever will I step foot in here and I have actually been in here when in town on business at least 5 times with co-workers in the last 2 years. I am so insulted by the \"RESORT FEE\" that I will tell anyone that I talk to about it as a \"can you believe this business practice?\""

We were told to sit where we wanted. We were sitting for 15 min and nobody came to our table. So, I went to the bar to order our drinks and food. I placed our order with the bartender. She said that the waitress will take our order at our table. I asked if I could order the drinks because no one has come to our table. The bartender rolled her eyes and said \"I guess\". I placed our drink order. I asked for 3 margaritas, 2 bud lights & 1 Miller lite. She gave me 3 bud lights. I told her that I asked 1 Miller lite & 2 bud lights. She rolled her eyes at me and  said \"no you didn't\"! I said yes I did,because I don't drink bud light. I drink Miller lite. With her attitude she refused to change 1 of the bud lights for a Miller Lite. I asked to speak the manager. I explained to him what had happened. He said \"no problem\"' and gave me a Miller lite. We also ordered food from the waitress. The wings and burgers were pretty good. We all have bad days. It wasn't necessary to give a customer attitude over a beer."

The host did not smile or greet, seem like she didn't want to be there, not so cheerleader like.   Our waiter was great.  I got the ribeye with sweet potato fries.  I was glad they put the powder sugar on the fries, it made taste much much better.  The steak was really good, nicely cooked and juicy.  Overall it was a good experience for me."

Patrons were upbeat. \n\nMixed reviews on the food. Built my own burger and the burger patty was flavorless and bland. Curly fries were great.

We chose to eat there cuz my bro in law had bets on the basketball games, so we figured we would go watch the games and drink some beers. -First problem is he asked for a glass of water to go along with his pint, the waitress said they only sell water for $1. Can you say, Illegal? -Second, all of the tv's were on sports center while the games were on. We asked our server to change a tv that only our table could see to the game. She responded with \"all of the tv's  have been requested to be on a certain channel by other guests.\" The place was practically empty. -Third, we ordered a $7 chips n salsa started and received half a basket of chips and prepackaged salsa. I asked for a refill of chips and she said she would ask about refills, and never came back. \n-Four. They had a special for a gallon (ish) personal table beer dispenser. I asked for that with the \"blondies\"  brand beer and was told they only fill it with buttwiper products, even though it says nowhere on the menu that it was restricted to that brand.\n-Five. the food sucked. I didn't expect much from a sports pub inside the miracle mile.. but this was really bad.\n-Six and final. I asked to speak to a manager and I addressed all my concerns list with him. As for the water, he told me it cost money to wash the glass so they can't give free water. I just spent well over $100. I think that can cover the rinsing of a glass. \nAs per the TV situation. He told me that it is first come first serve, but he would be happy to put a game on for me. (we're done eating now and don't care)\nAs per the chips. He said he will get us more chips. Again, we're done eating and don't care.)\nAs for the beer special, He told me that the menu should say its restricted, but won't do anything about it. I told him it was false advertisement and he compared his restaurant to a STRIP CLUB in saying that just because they say you're buying a lap dance doesn't mean you're not going to get a BJ+. \nHe blamed all of our problems on the waitress and told us not to tip her if we weren't happy with her service. I responded with fact that it was his fault because he is in charge and even if I didn't tip her, the company would still tax her for it. \nOverall, I will never go back to this dump."

Thank you Blondie's, I'll gladly accept the invitation. They are a sports bar and they make no bones about it. I would not recommend this place if you're expecting a quiet, peaceful meal with gourmet food. Blondie's hits the sweet spot for NFL Sundays and March Madness.\n\nWe clocked in just before noon on the first Thursday of March Madness and clocked out around 9 PM. Definitely reserve a table online for busy days like this. We didn't reserve a table and started out at the standing room by the back bar. By around 3 or 4 we had four seats across on the back bar with Daniel taking care of us. The minimum spending amount per customer that day was $45, which we had no problem meeting.\n\nWe had an unobstructed view of about ten screens all day with just a wave of the hand to Daniel for another round of drinks any time. The specials that day were a bucket of 5 beers for $25 and $6 shooters of Jameson, fireballs, or Patron. We had 7 buckets of beer, multiple rounds of shots, and plenty of action on the games. We did order a large pizza, a chicken quesadilla, and curly fries at some point, but honestly, I don't recall how any of it tasted at all.\n\nThe only snags we ran into all day was the restroom situation and the distance of the sports book. The restroom had one stall and one urinal only. With hundreds in the bar drinking, it often created a line out the door. Also, the sports book is about a ten minute walk to the front of Planet Hollywood. With long lines in the book, this leads to about a half hour trip to the sports book if needed. So place your bets early or have a mobile sports app.\n\nYes, we were gouged on beer prices (we basically paid $175 for a case and a half of bud light), but I had a great time with my buddies and our neighbors and we were paying for the entertainment value. We had better views of the games compared to a sports book. And we had plenty of action all day and won a little scratch. It was a memorable experience and I would do it again in a second."

As District One wasn't showing the game, me and my party opted to go to this place just to grab a drink or two and watch the game. The place was packed with tourists having a good time watching their own team win or lose. While this restaurant is perfectly located at the heart of the Miracle Mile Shops, I'm definitely not a fan of this bar. Err... Restaurant? Whatever it is. \n\nThe server I got was friendly as she consistently checked on me and my party whether we needed anything else such as water, condiments, and food. Besides the service, I'm a fan that I was able to watch the game here as it was really hard to find a bar that actually played it since they needed a sports package. I have to hand it to them, this is definitely a sports joint. \n\nAs for the bar... Don't get me wrong. I don't want to blame my bad drink to the bartender as it's probably his job to fill as little alcohol as possible in my drink and over charge me for a small glass, but hey, it's the Strip so I can't really have high expectations for this place. Usually, when I order a margarita, I would immediately get some kinda of a buzz since I'm very light weight. This had literally no effect on me. I feel really bad for anyone who gets a drink in this place thinking that they're going to get a buzz. \n\nI also order sweet potato fries to much on something while I watched the game, and man... I don't even want to start telling you how disappointing it is. I know for a fact that they were frozen. But as in cheap frozen sweet potato fries. I've had a frozen fries from my local market than the garbage that I was served. This seriously explains as to why I captioned \"meh\" on my photo of the sweet potato fries. \n\nAll the while... I got four drinks and an appetizer for about $55. I guess you can say it's not so bad... But the drinks were bad, and the food was bad. I'm on a quest to find a good bar here in Vegas, and this is definitely not one of them."

In fact, we had to go get someone to get us a server. When she finally showed up, it was quite awkward, as she didn't apologize, and then, of course, charged us for water. Unbelievable.\n\nThe food was not good. We had to track her down, again, to get our check. Never have I not left a tip. But this time, I was fed up.
