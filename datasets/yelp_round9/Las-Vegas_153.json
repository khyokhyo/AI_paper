We're talking Rainforest Cafe, after the forest was depleted of it's trees. \n\nFood was about as 'normal' as you can get... Simple. Don't expect Vegas quality food here. \n\n(Important Note: I ate in the restaurant part, the bar was hoping)"

            "review": "Interesting little place. Like all things Vegas, its pricey. I ordered a souvenir guitar yard cup which I know, I know that in itself runs the bills. I ordered a sample of their pina colada. I will tell you now I am a complete snob when it comes to my coladas. I want the real deal, so none of that crappy syrup sugar mix. Just, no. Of course, that's what they were serving so I ordered the Vacation. It was good but damn! (can I say that on yelp?) it was strong! My hunny ordered the blue lagoon. They were great but service was a little slow considering it was empty. Overall, we paid $40. Side note, we were seeing a show right next to the restaurant and I sadly did not know I couldn't take my drink in with me. So, we had to slam the extra strong rum/vodka mix. To say the least, I truly enjoyed the next two hours of vacation!"

Chicken and shrimp stir fry hibachi, 23.99\n5. Macadamia crusted mahi-mahi, 25.99 \nfor $10 (Used the living social deal $37 valued at $74)\n\n- Seated right away. Our server was Brittany, very polite and fast. \n- I enjoyed the banana mango over the kolada. Each drink comes with a test tube shot of vodka. Don't worry about getting tipsy with these drinks bc they both are very fruity. \n - Salads seemed pre-made bc the croutons were soft. hmm...\n- Chicken and shrimp stir fry was fulfilling. It's presented as if the meal spilled out of the chinese to-go box onto a plate. haha. Questionable presentation. If I don't finish my meal, do I use this oily box still? haha. I didn't btw, I got a new box. \n- Mahi-mahi was pretty good. crispy. Rice reminded me of Uncle Bens. Banana chip was yummy. \n-  Big portions. Enough for a 4th meal. haha.\n- Nice vacation style restaurant."

I've had baby back ribs plenty of times, but never did it have so much random chunks of bones and cartilage. Maybe just a poor cut of ribs. I could only eat 1/5 of the ribs before I just gave up.\n\nMy company ordered miso salmon - enjoyed it.\n\nAn hour later we both had extremely sour stomachs."

            "review": "BEWARE OF THE COUPONS!\n\nWe bought a coupon on Living Social for $50 worth of food for $25.  It sounded like a pretty good deal, however...  when we went to the restaurant we found out that the coupon is only good for about 8 entree items on the menu.  If you don't want to eat one of those 8 items then the coupon is worth only $25, or exactly what you paid for it.  We didn't see anything we wanted in the entree items so we ended up just using the coupon for what we paid for it.  I'm sure there is some small print somewhere that says that the coupon is only good for the entree items but it does seem like a bait and switch.  The food was actually pretty good but the whole coupon thing left a bad taste in my mouth.  We live in Las Vegas but I don't think we will ever go back there and I would definitely warn others to stay away."

My fiancee, who usually doesn't finish her food when we go eat out, actually finished the entire meal.  We ordered dessert at an extra cost.  So between the $37 I paid on Living Social and the $8 dessert plus the surcharge for an item that is above their allowed price of $23.99, we paid a total of $60 after tips and taxes for a $30 worth of meal... Without the Living Social coupon, that meal would have cost us $100 after tips and tax."

They also have a \"free shot\" deal if you log onto Four Square. \n\nThe Free shot.  \n\nThey give you a choice of three different of shots.   I ordered a Kamikaze and the waitress repeated it as a Lemon Drop and I confirmed Kamikaze.  She came back again to ask me what I ordered and I repeated Kamikaze... and I still did not get a Kamikaze.\n\nI ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich and my wife ordered the Chicken Parmesan (for the life of me I could not understand why Chicken Parm would be on a the menu of a Polynesian themed restaurant!)  \n\nMy sandwich was served on a plate that was HOT!  I mean hot like you would expect with an Italian or Mexican dish.  It was like just came out of the oven hot which made no sense as there was nothing to be melted on my meal.  The hot plate wilted the lettuce before it even got to the table.  Crisp lettuce compliments a crab cake sandwich, wilted, warm lettuce really distracts from it.  \n\nMy wife's chicken parm was nothing to write home about.  It tasted like a store bought chicken patty covered with store bought sauce, and topped with a little mozzarella cheese melted at the last minute.     \n\nThroughout our time there, our buy one get one free drink voucher sat in plain view on the table, however our waitress NEVER ASKED US what we would like.  I actually had to ask her of we could order a drink!  \n\nThis place has an EXTENSIVE tropical drink menu with not a single price on it.  With some research I found that the average drink on that menu is about $18!  So your \"free\" drink will cost you at least $9 if you order off the menu.  My wife ordered a Pina Colada and I had a Vodka Gimlet.  The gimlet was good but my wife said that the PC, the drink they discounted, was way too sweet and way too weak and she didn't finish it.   \n\nAfter serving our food, our waitress never came back to check on us, NEVER refilled our water and would not even make eye contact with us!  I actually had to call her attention to us just to get some water!\n\nThis restaurant looks and feels great.  The food presentation is very unique with dry ice \"smoking\" coconuts or volcano's on some dishes.  The food itself is ok but certainly not worth the price they charge.  It is rather expensive and the service was TERRIBLE!  This could be a really cool place if it operated on the premise of serving a quality experience rather than draining your wallet.\n\nEdit:\nMy wife wanted me to point out that when she ordered the Pina Colada, she ordered it made with Malibu Rum, what she got was the sugary , pre-made cocktails they have in the machines.  \n\nOnce again the waitress got our order WRONG!"

We were seated right near the hostess and our server didn't come to the table for like 15 minutes! She was completely out of it like she just rolled out of bed and came to work and didn't write anything down so of course she forgot things.\n\nThe food was just okay, I ordered the chicken teryaki with jasmine rice but i was smothered with huge chunks of vegetables and pineapple pieces. I wasn't wowed by my meal but at least one of our entrees was free!"

We came on the day of a major sporting event and asked to be seated where we could watch the game so she proceeded to have a small hissy fit about that. You can't really sit at the bar if you are planning to eat because the video poker machines built into the bar top make it impossible to set a plate down anywhere. \n\nOther than that, i was just OK. The food was alright, drinks were the typical Vegas scam. Halfway through our meal a girl in a bikini covered in leis and other beaded jewelry came to solicit jewelry for some cancer benefit and when I said we weren't interested we were met with a blank stare for several moments before she wandered off to the next table. \nThere are better places to eat on this end of the strip."

She called over someone but that person quickly went to book an event for people that were behind me waiting to be seated. The same lady saw that and told me if it was cool if I sat at the bar So I did. Starving and waiting for attention again, this time from the bartender. Not even a glance or any type of service from the woman behind the bar. I literally sat there for 10 minutes looking at the menu I grabbed from the side of the bar. I walked out never got to eat there again. First time I ate there was spring of 12' and it wasn't memorable. \n\nThere is a plus though, if you go there and actually get service, the bartenders flare bottles and do some pretty cool tricks. That's the only thing that's awesome about this place."

It was a Saturday night though, and we were interested in going to a bar, relaxing wtih some drinks and having a good time for several hours.\n\nThe waitress told us that to sit and watch the fight it was a $25pp minimum food spend.  I explained that we just ate, and there was no way that we would eat $25 of food each, but could we order drinks and appetizers?  We would definitely spend over $50 total.  She spoke to the manager, who put her foot down and said - no, that we needed to spend $25pp on food, if not, we would just be charged the $25.  (this after we had already started ordering)\n\nThis policy made no sense.  As a restaurant/bar they make more money on the booze than food ($12 drink with $4 worth of alcohol)....Instead of saying $25pp food minimum spend, why not say $25pp minimum spend on anything - or a flat cover charge of $15?  They would come out better overall doing either of those... Other bars that we've seen UFC events at charge a cover charge - and have a big room set aside for people watching the fight. \n\nAs a side note, people who said they were not watching the fight were still seated in areas where they could see it.  I wonder if they were charged the same?\n\nAnyways, so we ordered 2 dinner platters to go (since we would be charged anyways), and then ordered drinks.  The mixed drinks were truly terrible.  Lowest quality alcohol mixed with random sweet syrupy mess.  One of my drinks so was strong that I couldn't even drink it.  I had to go get more soda to water it down.  \n\nService was extremely slow.  At one point I choked on a tortilla chip and needed some water (we never received glasses of water) - so I had to walk all the way to the front of the restaurant to ask for some!  (the restaurant is quite deep so this took some time!)\n\nWaitress was completely absent.  It was a very busy night for them, I'm sure, but management needs to have more people working the tables to make sure people are happy.  We probably would have ordered more drinks if a waitress would've been there to ask if we wanted any!  They advertise having great bartenders who do tricks and whatnot, but I never saw one - and the drinks I ordered were not made by competant bartenders. \n\nOverall they just seemed completely disorganized in regards to handling a UFC event.  \n\n2 stars simply for the fact that we got a table near a tv screen, the food ended up being edible, and because it wasn't over $100 per person.  \"Meh I've had better\" (2 stars) describes my feelings perfectly."

Aside from the decor and drink list (with lots of fruity, tropical-sounding drinks), I'm not sure why this place is called \"tropical\" on the sign.  The music was basic Top 40 stuff, and the appetizers were standards like nachos, quesadillas, and sliders.\n\nService and quality were both pretty much average.  I definitely wouldn't go back during the day or evening, but it's not a bad option when it's getting later in the evening and most places are closed."

The waiter was a nice guy but visibly shaken by the number of tables he had.  We were there at 7:00 P.M.  Which I would think would be prime time.  Right off the bat they were out of 3 items on the menu.  Two of which were wanted by members of our party.  My fish was very good and my stepsons steak was good.  My Wife and daughter in law were not happy with their items at all.  We were very disappointed at the overall experience."

            "review": "I wasn't quite sure how many stars to give this place so I went for the middle. Here's the reason why:\n\nI love calamari. In fact, I consider myself a snob when it comes to this dish. Living in Las Vegas these past couple years, I was getting fearful I would never taste good calamari again. Then I went to Kahunaville! Awesome dish. I think what makes it soo good is the tangy sauce that comes with it. Yummie! Also, the drinks are not that bad either. I ordered a margharita specifically the way I like it (skinny girl style) and it was made perfectly. My friends also enjoyed the speciality drinks from the menu while we were there. \n\nHowever...\nThe speciality drinks were way overpriced. Also, while there for dinner with my friends (same mentioned above), we had a confusing and baffling experience which brings the rating of this place down in my mind. One of my friends is pregnate and therefore watching what she is eating. That night, she ordered the nachos, which she had been craving. When placing the order, she requested the peppers and olives be on the side. Also she asked that the gouda cheese not be included. When the dish came, it was exactly as described in the menu but not as she had ordered. Good thing she and her husband had also ordered a plate of chicken wings. The waitress was wonderful to take the plate of nachos back to the kitchen to get the order corrected. BUT she then returned w/. strange news-  the kitchen refused to change the order. \n\nI have never been to a restaurant that would not be willing to give a customer what they wanted. The cheeses apparently were pre-mixed. No problem for my friend. But the kitchen still refused to serve the peppers and olives on the side. My friend canceled the nachos order and instead decided to get french fries. A half hour later and the rest of us (a total of 6 people in our party) were finished with our plates and the fries had still not arrived. When all was said and done, my friends paid more for the 1 speciality drink (they got a free plastic cup- whoopie!) than for their meal-- one plate of chicken wings.\n\nTherefore, I give this restaurant 3 stars:\nGreat calamari and margharita\nHorrible kitchen service and overpriced drinks. Oh yeah- the plastic cup was tacky as well. \n\nMy advice- only go here for the appetizers and a couple of drinks but nothing else."

Unfortunately, it was not to be. The only beer they had on draft is...... Bud Light. Yes. Bud Light.\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad.  What arrived was an enormous bowl of mostly cabbage with a few leaves of spring salad buried beneath the cabbage and 4 pieces of tuna on top.  If I wanted coleslaw, I would have ordered coleslaw.  Just yuck.  \n\nThere are way too many other places in Vegas to waste your time here."

It turned out to be a ginormous platter of Nachos. We ended up getting out for about $25 including drinks... \n\nThis time we opted for the appy sampler. More expensive, around $25 but it did have a neat-o volcano on the plate. So this meal was a little more pricey, around $35 with drinks, but still pretty reasonable.

Service however was very good. \n\nHalfway through our meal the lights slowly dimmed, some lights illuminated some fake rocks and some water squirted out as if we might find it entertaining. It was so dark I couldn't see all the grease oozing out of the sausage. \n\nLate that evening on the way back to our rooms, the place was packed. It seems they are known for their bartender's juggling acts, ala the movie cocktail. Makes sense as the other TI bar, Gilley's bar reminds me of the movie Urban Cowboy."

The cubed breakfast potatoes were really good, well seasoned with a nice crispy on the shell protecting a soft and mushy inside. Not a bad way to start a Sunday morning."

            "review": "VERY disappointing - Not only were the drinks and food terrible, we both were sick before we got back to our hotel. \n\nThe Deal - We had purchased a Groupon for $28.99 which included two appetizers and four cocktails up to $9.99 for each item. This would have been a good value if the quality of the drinks, food, and service had been average.  Adding an automatic 18% gratuity was insulting and really made this meal a total failure. Our server explained that we had the option of ordering any appetizers or cocktails and paying the difference between the price and the $9.99 Groupon limit, per item. \n\nDrinks - For drinks I ordered a dirty martini and my date ordered a Blue Iguana. The martini was undrinkable and it takes a lot to screw up vodka and olive juice. Literally, it was room temperature vodka and olive juice poured in a plastic martini glass. This martini had never been introduced to ice and tasted terrible. The Blue Iguana was sickenly sweet and without the hint of alcohol. \n\nThis was the first time in my life that I returned drinks. We asked if we could substitute bottled beers for the drinks because we definitely did not want another cocktail from that bar. The bottled beers were cool, but not cold enough for condensation to form on the bottle. No glasses were provided. Essentially, we substituted warm bottled beers for what should have been cocktails.\n\nFood - We upgraded our order to the sampler and a large shrimp cocktail. In fairness, the shrimp cocktail was okay. The sampler included two greasy, mushy spring rolls of some sort; two very greasy coconut shrimp; two or three bites of skewered chicken, three or four chicken wings, some BBQ ribs, a lot of tasteless, multi-colored corn chips; and, a large empty coconut shell. The ribs were average and everything else on this tray was much below average. Nothing on this plate was prepared fresh and my guess is that the temperature of the food was generated in a microwave. \n\nThe decor is plastic and cheesy. The manager, bartenders, and staff were absolutely uninterested."

OK what ever... we stood at the podium, and we stood some more; finally 15minutes went by and we got our name on a list along with 1 other couple; the third was told to wait. Every few minutes someone would come up and look at the list and run away. We left after 30 minutes. Later that day we complained to the manager who met us at the front desk, she seemed very nice but was one of the people who was providing poor service that morning. She claimed that it was abnormal since she had 3 employees call in sick that day and invited us to return, a meal on her to receive great service that they're known for... boy was I an idiot to accept. We went in the next morning, and though we were sat quickly we saw our waitress 3 times... she took our order, she dropped off our food, then she dropped off our bill. A coffee carafe means, I DO NOT have to come back to fill your mug or talk to you again, and after having sat there for 10min after my food was delivered to inform the waitress my steak and eggs breakfast was wrong is pathetic. The eggs which were ordered Over Medium, had very little yoke on one egg, the other was NONE, the Steak which was ordered Well Done was dark on the outside but bloody rare on the inside... basically grill was way too hot and it burned the outside while the inside of my steak was cold and VERY red. I was told they could re-fire it, but what's the point of throwing a burnt raw steak on a grill? How does that solve it? I told the waitress not to worry about it, wasn't her fault even though she should have known by looking at it something was wrong, and should have informed the cook not to give her that crap. We didn't pay for our meal, but the manager never stopped by to make sure we were taken care of based on our first horrible attempt to visit, and the staff was running around completely lost, I saw 8 tables inside, and two wait staff plus 1 hostess who's entire plan to seat people was \"This way\" then walk as quickly to a table as she could, drop the menus off then abruptly leave, most the customers couldn't keep up with her. The food here is fairly pricey, the service is downright rude if not generally nonexistent and the cooks probably couldn't handle a hungry-man TV dinner in a microwave.\n\nConstantly you'll see women in Hawaiin clothing trying to give away coupons for free drinks and money off your meal, they do this because once you go there you'll not want to return."

There was a guy performing live on stage and it seemed like their hula show had just let out.  Service was pretty good but a bit rushed but we didn't mind much.  It is Vegas after all.  The slushie drinks were way too sweet so we stayed w/ the  mixed cocktails. We enjoyed people watching especially when the DJ started his music.  I think Kahuanville turns into a club after 10? Not sure but it was a good time for all.  I have to say it is a older crowd tho for sure.  But if we're ever in town, we'd be back to hang out again.  We had our 18 yr old w/ us and she had a blast, and we were glad we could be at a place where it was ok to have fun w/ your parents while getting crazy."

The dishes ranged from $18 to $30.   I was not impressed with this place, and will not go back due to the way my girlfriend was treated.  While I would give this place 2 stars (based on food quality/taste/price), my girlfriend would definitely give them ZERO stars.  Her steak, ordered medium rare, came out fully cooked and dry.  We were in a party of 12, and it took about 45 minutes for the server to bring out a new steak for her.  That steak was cooked \"well\" which really upset my friend.  Not only was everyone done eating, her steak was still overcooked.  The final straw was that the manager still charged her for her portion even though she didn't eat the second steak and it was not prepared as ordered. While the server was nice, I think it was wrong of management to charge her for her $28 steak when it was clearly overcooked a second time."

The soup was excellent and so were the fries that came with the sandwich. The sandwich itself was alright.\nI'm writing this review to highlight the service provided by Rowan Y. I was visiting Vegas by myself and received very bad service from most waiters in other restaurants, maybe since serving a party of one doesn't lead to a good tip? Rowan was very friendly and he checked on me during the meal without making me feel like he was ready to clear the table. I also saw him joking with the other customers in the restaurant. My lunch experience was great, thanks to him."

We had a coupon for drinks and one for food. We had dinner plans later but it was our last opportunity to use the deals! so we called ahead to reserve the first available dinner spot. I think it was at 4pm (or around there). We were told we couldn't use the deals simultaneously (go from dinner table to bar for refills). WEll that's crap. The bar was dead. Why is this a problem?\n\nTRAVELZOO DEAL:\n$25 - Treasure Island: 6 Drinks & Bartender Show, 55% Off\n\nGROUPON DEAL:\n$26 for Island-Themed Dinner for Two at Kahunaville Island Restaurant & Party Bar (Up to $54.96 Value) Diners receive two side house salads (a $3.49 value each) and choose a total of two entrees (up to a $23.99 value each).\n\nWe started at the bar while we waited for the restaurant to open.\n\nWhile the drinks were good, the bartender was inattentive. Took forever to get some change so that we could both gamble at the bar. Only one other couple at the bar. Upon ordering our third drink, we asked about the included \"show\" and she tossed the bottles around as she poured. Wish we'd asked on the first drink. The drinks were good though and we were allowed to bring the final one to the lunch/dinner table - good timing.\n\nWe couldn't order off the full menu because of our deal. I really need to read the fine print because this broke my hungry heart to hear. Groupon had a link to the full menu when I purchased, so I didn't think there would be restrictions. I'm sure it said it somewhere. Instead of crab cakes I ordered the macademia crusted mahi mahi ($25.99). Husband had flank steak and grilled shrimp ($26.99). We both had caesar salad ($3.49). The salad was heavily dress but the croutons on it were incredible!! I had to share mine though since his salad only had two and I had a bunch. The drinks must have nicened me up - I rarely share food as good as they were!\n\nMy fish wasn't bad ,but wasn't great. He hated his steak because it was pre-cut into strips and overcooked.  I liked it though. And we both enjoyed his shrimp.  Had a lot of food leftover - which I took to the room and ate in the morning - and picked at the following day. Would have been nice to have a fridge.\n\nService was fine. Our server was great and the one at the table next to us was friendly also.\n\nSavings of $54.96 with dinner coupon - a great deal!"

And the size of the glass that they served them to you in was about the size of a champagne flute. We thought it was just because it's the Las Vegas strip and if we want what we pay for we should continue to go to a locals place. The food was okay, if we had to eat there again we wouldn't complain but this place wouldn't be our choice. The main reason why I had to give this place 3 stars was our waitress..... My boyfriend and I showed up before our other guests she took our drink order, left and gave us our drinks, then when our other half of the party showed up she rushed them into ordering their drinks as well as their meals. And only came back to give us our checks which she highlighted the 30% tip suggestion. There is also an 18% and 25% suggestion but she opted to suggest the biggest tip. Our tab was 86/87 dollars without the tip. Our experience there was not worth it. The service sucked for a Saturday night and the food was okay. We will not return if it is up to us."

We walked through the ENTIRE dining room, up some stairs, and were seated, by ourselves in a corner while the rest of the dining room was half full at best. \n\nNo worries though, we were willing to stick it out..  15 minutes and NO SERVER.  So we decide we are going to sit in the bar which was about 1/3 full.  We sat and were'nt even acknowledged by ANY staff.  About 15 minutes after sitting I flagged down a waitress and asked if anyone was going to take our order.\n\nShe seemed like a full on tweaker.  She responded with \"yeah you want drinks?  you ready for the whole thing now?  What do you want?\"  I ordered our drinks and before I could get the second drink past my lips she was high tailing it away from me......I literally had to run (walk fast) after her to let her know that I wasn't done.  Finally was able to order Chicken Stir Fry Hibachi style.\n\nDrinks came quickly because the bartender walked them over himself.  Not so much for the food..........1 hour later the food came out (again, the bar was about half full at this time) and it was WRONG!  It was shrimp and chicken stir fry.  My wife is DEATHLY allergic to shrimp so needless to say I wasn't having this.....especially after waiting 1 hours for our food.  I told the waitress that the order was wrong and she quickly apologized and grabbed the plate and disappeared............for 2 minutes then came back with our \"correct order\".  Upon inspection, and tasting we realized that all they did was pull the shrimp out of our food and send it back.....STONE COLD!!!!!!!!!!\n\nLuckily my wife dug into an area on the dish where there was no shrimp.  I would have owned this restaurant, shut it down, and take a dump right in front of where this restaurant used to be just to remind people of what they are missing.\n\nI asked for the manager......was blown off.....waitress apologized......I wasn't having it......refused to pay bill......walked out!\n\nHORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!

The hostess apologized for the oversight & washed it off but the rag looked dirty as well. We then waited about 5 minutes before the waiter acknowledged us & said he would be back in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later the hostess saw us still sitting there & came over to see if we had been helped & when we said no proceeded to take our order. I could go on about the service of our waiter but let's move on to the food. I know it is Vegas & food is pricey but the quality was terrible! My boyfriend's chicken tasted frozen & the marinara tasted like a can. My coconut shrimp tasted like the stuff you get in the freezer section (not bad but expected more for the price), vegetables were overcooked & blaw, the rice was rice.  If we hadn't gotten the entire meal for 50% off we would've been upset paying full price for such terrible meals.  \n\nThe only positive from our experience was my mixed drink (the Vacation I believe was the name) which really was very good!

But, the dining room has a little fountain show that plays every hour, which is pretty neat - think tiny-scale, primitive Bellagio fountains.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the Surf's Up salad which was made up of iceberg lettuce, shredded cheddar, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers and croutons (she also got chicken on hers). And these salads... they were HUGE! We could barely finish them! I think the best part was the croutons because they were very flavorful.\n\nOur other friend got the Skinny Dip which is a roast beef sandwich topped with mozzarella and provolone cheese, horseradish sauce and served with au jus to dip it in. It also came with french fries which were thin cut, very crispy and DELICIOUS (I know because I stole a few).\n\nAnd last but not least, our other friend got the Big Kahuna Cheeseburger which was topped with American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. He seemed to like it a lot, which is always a good thing. (He opted to get a salad instead of fries which I think is a travesty)\n\nI'm glad to say that the great food and extremely reasonable prices made up for the hostesses' lame attitude.

That said, Kahunaville still holds a special place in my heart.\n\nThe drinks are pretty overpriced but decently alcoholic - I really liked the mojito (they're generous with the limes and mint!). When Martin M and I had a cutesy little date here (and by cutesy, I mean we even had our pictures taken by some random photographer and actually bought the print), I had the crab salad. It comes in this little plastic coconut shell and just exuded \"island themed party\". It tasted pretty good, even though the crab was pretty obviously the canned variety.\n\nRecently we came back on a double date and the four of us split a bunch of the appetizers (appeTEASErs? hehe). The sliders were awesome, as was the fried calamari, which comes with a red curry sauce. The nachos weren't really my thing, but what I did like about them was their peculiar resemblance to chili cheese fries fresh from the pier. Our server was hilarious and we wish we could have bought him a drink!\n\nFor all four of us, a light dinner with cocktails ran about $60 after those spiffy coupons they hand out right outside the restaurant. One day we'll have to come back to check out the bar (and the oxygen bar!). All in all, a pretty fun way to start an evening in Vegas, especially with TI being centrally located on the Strip :)"

The girl that was working there, Rachel, was really nice and explained the services included with the $20 spent here.  I was only supposed to be hooked up to an oxygen machine (four per machine, 8 machines total), but ended up accidentally staying there for about 40 minutes.  I also got a scalp massage and my back was massaged with these battery operated massagers.  I also got my choice of either a souvenir glass or a shot of Skyy flavored Vodka (shooter) or a Monster energy drink.  Since I was already exhausted, I just pocketed the alcohol.\nI did get some peppermint oil on my palms which I made sure to inhale so that my sinuses were cleared out.  Not too bad.  \n\nHonestly, I felt like the oxygen therapy worked.  I came in exhausted and walked out feeling re-energized for a good 6-8 hours after.  \n\nI haven't had a chance to try out any of the other oxygen bars here, but I thought that I at least got my money's worth AND made a new acquaintance.  All in all, the service was great.  Can't complain.  Will definitely be returning to this location for another visit."

I asked what time the shows were and she said 8:30 and 11:30.  We returned Halloween night (Thursday), just before 8:30 and were told that the shows were only on Friday and Saturday.  So, we got no show and 6 \"$9.00\" drinks that I would not have paid more than $5 for.  There were three choices-Strawberrry Daiquiri, Margarita and Pina Colada, about 12 oz each.  The bartender was nice.  The hostess should have told us there were no shows Sun-Thurs.  The drinks were mediocre."

It's ridiculous that it would take such an inordinate amount of time to get scrambled eggs. \n\nMy parents had already ordered and were eating by the time I arrived at the restaurant, so I had some of their food before I ordered. The scrambled eggs, hash browns, and bacon I tried were no better than what you get at Denny's. It is worth noting that the portions are very large at Kahunaville. My parents shared a meal, and it was plenty of food.\n\nI decided to try the fruit platter. It was definitely an experience. My fruit platter had a whole banana, 1/4 of a pineapple, 5 strawberries, lots of honeydew melon and cantaloupe, grapes, orange slices, more pineapple, and a yogurt dipping sauce. All of the fruit was ripe and tasty. However, there was an unexpected and unpleasant surprise in the dish. They drizzled a liberal amount of some liqueur over the fruit. Why??? The fruit was fine on its own. Who wants to taste alcohol when it's not in an amount appreciable enough to get you buzzed? I feel like they should have at least mentioned that on the menu. \n\nI'm not sure how this place is for other meals, but I'm not inclined to give it another chance."

French fries cold, nachos blah with no real cheese or full coverage but the crab cakes and other side items were good. \n\nThey offered us coupons for 2 for 1 entrees but the fine print only allowed up to $20 off and most entrees costed more. They also offered a 2 for 1 yard drink but it couldn't be combined with the other coupon. \n\nOur server was great though, he was friendly and brought us a new set of warm fries and a complimentary alcoholic beverage for the inconvenience we were experiencing. So although the food wasn't great and we wouldn't come back or recommend this establishment - I gave two stars for the service and crab cakes."

That $6.99 breakfast was awesome and so worth every cent. The coupon allows you to get 3 eggs any style, toast, home fries, and your choice of breakfast meat. The portion is pretty hearty and it's darn good too!!!!! The best part is that they apply the coupon to everyone in your party. For Vegas, this is great value.\n\nWe came back for dinner that night out of pure laziness. I wanted the French Dip sandwich, but they're pretty strict and won't let you order from the lunch menu during dinner. Oh well.\n\nI ordered the chicken tortilla soup instead. The chicken was just alright. I am pretty sure it was pre-cooked chicken strips (a la Perdue) and the broth was chock full of tomato chunks. I didn't notice any other veggie. The broth was flavorful, but the soup itself lacked substance. \n\nFor cocktails, I ordered the All Mix'd Up drink - it was a mix of flavored vodka with cranberry juice and soda water I believe. Yum. My girlfriend had the Otter Pop. It tasted just like an Otter Pop - super sugary and sweet.\n\nMy girlfriend had the hamburger sliders. These were DELISH. They mixed the ground beef with chorizo and topped them with cheese. Holy flavor explostion. They're served on mini Hawai'ian rolls. SO GOOD.\n\nI'll definitely be back here for breakfast (if I have the coupon), but not sure I'd have dinner here again. Not worth it."

I ordered the Coconut Almond Chicken appetizers that probably had more breading on it than chicken. The raspberry sauce that accompanied it was good, but not on the chicken. Their salads seem to be very filling and are served in very generous portions. We ordered the Shrimp Salad that had all but 5 pieces of shrimp and other fruits and lettuce. It was good, but seemed more like a fruit salad than a dinner salad. Very good for the health conscious. Their prices are not quite reasonable but average for a tourist spot.

One day, my family spent the day by the pool at T.I. in a cabana and it was convenient to order breakfast and lunch from this place.  For breakfast, I had eggs benedict with the hollandaise sauce on the side. Decent. For lunch, I had a Cuban Sandwich. Again, pretty good. The best part was that they gave me a MOUNTAIN of fries with my sandwich. Nothing reminds you that you are weak like eating an enormous serving of french fries while looking at tiny girls in tiny bikinis. Oh well.\n\nThe next day, I had a Buffalo Chicken wrap and was really disappointed. The Buffalo sauce had some weird \"tang' to it that was very unnecessary. Also, our server that day was this quirky guy named \"Rodeo\" who refilled our drinks by bringing out a new glass but poured that liquid into our glass on the table. I dunno- I think that's weird.\n\nNonetheless, when I'm in Vegas and I want Chili's or Applebees quality food, I'll drop by Kahunaville."

Vegas is one of those places where the tackier the better can work. Can. Not does, definitively. Just can. \n\nKahunaville has a pretty decent bar- don't get me wrong. Yes, drinks are pricey, but more often times than not there are cute girls passing out BOGO drink coupons so that can help. They do some really fun tropical drinks, and I'm kind of a rum fiend so I really had a blast. My personal favorite was the rock candy mango mojito. I love me some mango! And yes, the bartenders do tricks and do all the cool throwing tricks and fun stuff like that. As far as the bar goes, I dig it. There's gambling machines in the bar and drinks are fruity and fun. A good vacation bar. About every hour there is a small \"tsunami\" that goes on which consists of lowering lights, sounds, doing some flashing lights, and a small water fountain show. Kinda cool, but gets annoying the second time it happens. \n\nAs for the restaurant, my girlfriend and I were slightly less than impressed. We had the groupon deal for two house salads and two entrees. The entrees were only covered up to $23.99, and about 2/3 of the entree menu worked for that. I hate when they do groupons but end up doing upcharges because they barely cover anything. So that was good.\n\nI started with a ceasar, pretty standard. My friend got a house salad that was swimming in honey mustard. We also shared a bowl of the crab bisque which was absolutely the best thing I've had there food wise. It was just... omg. I loved the crab bisque so much I contemplated getting another bowl. Like a chump I held out til my entree came then was too full to get another bowl.\n\nMy girlfriend got the shrimp with rice, which was nothing to write home about but had a good sauce. As for me, I got the steak teriyaki. Ugh.  The meat was so chewy that it took me forever to finally get it down. I think my girlfriend had about three shrimps by the time I got through my first piece of meat. The broccoli ended up being the tastiest thing on that plate- even the rice was a little gross. It wasn't steamed long enough. \n\nI like the drinks and the crab bisque was amazing, but that's about it. I'd suggest skipping it until the pre-party."

We decided on Kahunaville, because it looked fun, and had immediate seating.  We were asked if we wanted a high or low table.  We asked for a low, which clearly was the wrong answer, as we were responded to with an eye roll and a huff before being seated.  I am a fan of frozen drinks, and the variety sounded yummy, so I ordered one of their signature drinks.  The cocktail arrived, and at first sip, I thought they must have forgotten to mix it, as all I had was a mouthful of coconut flavored syrup.  I stirred frantically and tried again...nope, more syrup.  The waitress came around to take our food order.  I told the waitress of issue with the drink, and she said \"ya, I know.\"  I asked if there was something much less sweet, & she recommended the mojito, which I agreed to.  She then asked for our food order.  when I ordered a \"cajun\" seasoned pasta dish, I was informed that \"most people your age don't like that because it's too spicy\". Yes, clearly 40 is the new 80...love it!  But after assurances that I enjoyed spicy food, our orders went in.  When the waitress came back with my drink, one taste told me that, less sweet, was not something that they did, so I immediately gave up, ordered a diet Coke, & sent back the drink.  \n\nWhen our food arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it was really quite tasty (yes, my ancient palette survived the dreaded spice).  Both my husband and I enjoyed our meals.  As far as the show, asking for a low table in our case meant sitting at the service entrance which actually had a small wall between us and the stage, so the only floor show we got was an argument between a bartender and his wife/girlfriend.  \n\nWith all of the wonderful dinner choices in Vegas, and even right there at TI, this will definitely be the place we skip next time we're in town."

My friend got soup and said it was good not great, they split the burger after and it was average as well.  My teryiaki chicken and shrimp was ok, the flavors seemed off and the rice was bland.  The pineapple was a nice addition though.  With the rice you have multiple varieties of protein and veggies you can pick though and three different styles.  I picked teryiaki cause usually pineapple adds flavor to the dish, here it was the best part of the dish but it didn't bring the dish together.  He got a pasta and chicken dish, very filling and different were the remarks.  The menu was average but not a lot of healthy protein choices available.  For a better experience and quality of food there are better local places.  \nBut they did draw a large crowd with their bar competition and free shots.

We were seated in an uncomfortable chair for one person in my party because that person has recently has back surgery and we needed to switch to a booth.Our hostess dropped our menus and look off before we could ask and there was no one around and one other table in the dining room so we moved to a booth to accommodate the disabled person in our party. We wait 15 minutes for service, and had to get someone for service.Meanwhile, the server was waiting on a table 3 tables away from us and cleaned off a table 2 tables away from us and we got the impression that we were being ignored because we weren't in her area. Then after we went to get someone, she came to our table with a BAD attitude and was very nasty to us, and went off on us for moving because this section was closed. We were appalled\nShe had on no nametagon, but we found out by asking another server that her name was Tonya. She did not introduce herself because she was too busy insulting us. Once she stopped with the attitude at the end of our meal, we told her the reason we moved was for a medical purpose and she apologized for the misunderstanding. It made for a very uncomfortable experience our entire time there.\nOur problem was the way she acted, not the wait. Its also not OK that we had to explain the disability situation to get the staff member to calm down because thats our personal business we would rather not have to explain and relive it  every time we go to a restaurant."

A little less than $10 per drink, and they have Happy Hour specials, as well.  Since this is Vegas, the bartenders are pro's at entertaining while making drinks and performing for their show.

On the Monday night that we stopped in before hitting the Strip, the entertainment was dueling pianos.  I can honestly say that the guys performing the dueling pianos were horrible.  So horrible that not even consuming additional quantities of alcohol could make them any better.  Go to New York, New York on the other end of the Strip for a decent piano bar.  We next stopped in on Thursday before heading out to some clubs.  We decided to try out the Kahunaville Oxygen bar which is located up front.  Never tried an oxygen bar before but it was only $20.00 for 20 minutes so we gave it a shot.  I guess it's supposed to give you energy and/or make you feel good inhaling the O2 (oxygen).  There were also different scents mixed in while hooked up.  A head and back massage by the female bartender using some strange contraption for the head and a three roller thing for the back was also included.  A Monster brand energy drink and a small bottle of vodka to mix in were provided too.  This mix was actually pretty good but probably wasn't a good idea on an empty stomach along with some other drinks as I would find out later."

They are probably 20 ounces of icy mixture and 1 1/2 ounces of alcohol. AVOID!!! The guys dealing you the drinks are great though and the show they put on is fun.

Six or seven bartenders go up and perform their tricks. Yes, the dj picks some pretty cheesy music (occasionally), but when you've had a couple drinks in you, listening to the Hammer doesn't seem all that bad.... The best part is when the bartenders auction off their Malibu, Captain Morgan's, Smirnoff, Vodka, orange juice concoctions...With all the alcohol that goes into that oversized glass, it's totally a deal."

Our unhappy middle-aged ex-stripper of a waitress walk up to our table, frowning, and just stood there with a pad and pen. I greeted her with \"Good morning\" and her response was \"What's your order?\". We all kindly gave our order, and my husband was finishing his when she walked off. The problem was that he wasn't finished with his order. He hollered \"Excuse me, miss?\" to get her attention before she walked too far and she turned around, rolled her eyes, and just stared at him without saying a word. My husband asked for a side of sausage, and rather than any sort of \"thank you\" or \"coming right up\", she just walked off with an attitude. \n\nI have a feeling this particular waitress came back and cursed us out, without thinking her attitude and lack of professionalism had anything to do with our absence.\n\nWe all left feeling like we were on a hidden camera show for bad service.

It's a little  confusing to see Hawaiian names and foods next to Caribbean names and foods, but as Chris Rock would say - it's all right cause it's all white!  The quality of food is so-so, nothing to write home to ma.  Location is prime...I think TI is one of the better hotels destinations on the strip - huge parking garage, convenient location (near the highway on ramp), close to the gigantic mall, nice theme, good club (Tangerine)...but I digress.\n\nSo Kahunaville will try it's damnedest to entertain the crap out of you while you eat.  In a less than intrusive way, which I appreciated.  We ordered a couple of the sample appetizer plates which came with a fake volcano and deco pieces.  Every 45 minutes or so, they would dim the lights for the water show I'll call Baby Bellagio.  There's girls walking around in coconut bras, asking people if they want to get \"lei'd\" for $20...which is the cheapest lay on the Strip.  And of course, the professional bartender show, which gets everyone in a Spring-Break woo-hoo frame of mind.  Remember visiting Cancun for spring break, partying hard at the bars with Mexican dudes whistling and pouring drinks into half-naked girls' mouths?  Well, take away the Mexican dudes and add a little more clothes to the girls...that's what it was like :)"

I would strongly suggest going here for dinner and make sure you get a seat in the bar area not back in the restaurant. The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing! They put on a fantastic flair show hourly. I have seen this show probably 125+ times. Every time I see it I am impressed! \n\nThe drinks are very touristy and moderately priced for a restaurant on the strip. The food is good! I would personally suggest the Nachos! Its not gourmet, but their take on island food is decent.\n\nYou will definitely agree that seeing the show is worth the time to stop through and have a few drinks!"

I had been here over 10 years ago and while I liked the food, the loud bar customers and louder music were a complete annoyance.  I never thought I'd return.\n\nI had a reservation for 5 PM which would give me plenty of time for the 7 PM show.  As the hostess was walking with me, she asked if I wanted bar seating for happy hour or did I want dinner seating in the downstairs dining room.  Bingo!  Downstairs to avoid any loudness!  I never knew it existed.\n\nDown about 7 steps is a large room off the pool at TI and this is there main dining room.  I was seated halfway in the dining room and I had a good view toward both one pool area and the stairs.  Right in front of me was a TV with Monday Night football so that took my attention.  \n\nRowan was my server and he was there soon with menu and took my order for iced tea.  After looking things over and asking about the soup of the day, I opted for chicken tortilla soup to start and Bang Bang shrimp for the main course.\n\nThe chicken tortilla soup is listed on the menu as spicy but it wasn't--at least not for me.  The soup was very hot and it was good.  The chicken was a bit meager.  There were some tortilla chips standing in the bowl instead of the normal tortilla strips most places use.  This was good.  At this time came the only glitch in service.  Before I finished my soup, a runner came from the kitchen with my main course.  Damn, I wish restaurants would watch this.  If I hadn't been somewhat close to finishing my soup, I would have sent her back.  But then, it would probably sit under a heat lamp for a few minutes.\n\nThe Bang Bang shrimp was very good and a reason to return.  The dish consists of 8 shrimp with bacon, zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli, red pepper, and carrots.  The shrimp have a nice spicy zest to them making their bang bang name appropriate.  The rice appeared to be regular rice rather than jasmine and the shrimp wasn't served over a bed of rice as the menu states, but it was a good looking dish with an orchid in the rice.  Nice touch.\n\nFor dessert, I got the pineapple upside down cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was OK and something different.\n\nService was very good.  Rowan brought a new iced tea before I finished the first one and he asked if I wanted a cup to take my leftover iced tea with me.  His service was very good and he was a very personable and polite man.\n\nOn the way out, the hostess wished me a good evening and used my name which was a very nice touch.  This is a place to which I'd return if I were coming to TI, not something I do very often."

Food was great and our waitress Barbara was the highlight of our experience. She kept the party going and made sure everything was perfect. Most of our party ordered a steak; it wasn't Ruth's Chris but it sure was easy on my wallet. I recommend the Jerk Satays and the shrimp appetizer.

I was really hoping she would be open to dining Off Strip but alas, when I met up with her she pulled out her coupon pocketbook. Oh lordy!\n\nShe had a 2-for1 buffet coupon as well as those pesky Kahunaville coupon strips the girl in the Hawaiian getup hands you at the bottom of the parking garage escalator. I voted for the buffet but she wasn't \"hungry enough to eat at the buffet\", she assumed she had to make three trips and stuff herself, tourist mentality for sure.\n\nAs we headed into the garish Kahunaville restaurant the hostess asked if we would like to sit inside or outside in the pool area. We chose the latter.\n\nThe first red flag should have been the fact that we were not escorted to our table but rather told to turn right, walk down the hallway, and then turn right out of the doors. The outside patio was covered and had misters which was a plus.\n\nAfter waiting for one table to have an order taken and drink refills for another table (a good 15 minutes) we were finally asked by a waitress what we would like to drink. We told her we would like to use our one free drink coupon which she said was fine but that we wouldn't be able to use any of the other three coupons during this visit. That stunk especially because we wanted to use the \"Buy 1 entree, get one 50% off\" coupon as well.\n\nAfter another 10 minutes, our drinks arrived. Mine had about 10 melted ice cubes and tasted like a watered down blue mess. After complaining about my drink the waitress explained \"Oh, it depends who the bartender is that day.\" What the heck kind of answer, fix, or apology is that? Then the waitress finally got around to taking our order \"Did you decide what you want?\" Obviously, since we have had 25 minutes to study the entire two page menu!\n\nThe food was okay, nothing to rave about, for the same price you're better off eating at the hotel cafe. The waitress made no apologies for our experience, blaming anything we complained about on the bartenders or cooks. The couple next to us even addressed the fact that the service was horrible.\n\nWhile my friend picked up the tab I still felt like I was cheated."

My bf and I both got a sampler plate that had 4 different types of sandwiches and their shoe string fries. Fries were bomb, and the sandwiches were all pretty good too except the PIna Colada chicken. It was too sweet and just had a weird taste. The Mushroom Chicken sandwich was to die for!\n\nWe left and later came back to see if we were able to buy a yard, but I guess they're only sold at Harrah's now, so we bought a half yard. The bartender that made it for us hooked it up!! 10 shots of tequila, 10 shots of I think it was Midori? All for $28 bucks! She topped it off with some Monster because I was feeling a little tired because I didn't sleep that much the night before, and she told us her shift ends at 5 PM so if we came back in time, she would refill out half yard for $10!\n\nThe bartenders also do \"shows\" with the shaker & liquor bottles.

The service was great, restaurant is clean and the ambiance is fun.  I ordered the New York Strip steak with cream cheese chive mashed potatoes and vegetables.   My meal also came with a caesar salad, which was served to me before I received the main entree.  I also ordered my steak medium rare, and it was cooked to PERFECTION!!  This was impressive because a lot of places end up over cooking steaks.  My boyfriend ordered the steak stir fry, which was also very good!  The potions were huge, and the presentation of the food was lovely!  \n\nMost items on the menu were fairly priced.  I live here in Vegas, so I know that anytime you eat on the strip your meal is going to be a bit pricey!  The drink menu is huge, but due to a long night of drinking the night before, water is all we wanted that night.\n\nFor dessert we shared a fried waffle, which was delicious! It was served with a very rich vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream.  Overall I was impressed and I left a very happy customer!  I will definitely be eating at Kahunaville again!   I'm sad I didn't give it a try sooner!  It would also be a fun place to come if you have people come to town and you want to take them to a fun place!  They have live music nightly as well!"

Cousin and cousin's husband had arrived the night before us, walked past Kahunaville, heard the general party atmosphere commotion coming from within, and determined this might be a good spot to spend some time and money. Boy were they wrong.\n\nI don't know what was happening the night before, but when we came it was dead. Granted it was early, only about 8:00 or so, but it was a Friday night and we wanted to have fun. The atmosphere is cheesy, reminded me of a Rainforest Caf\u00e9 but more sleazy, at first I thought it WAS a Rainforest Caf\u00e9, ha ha ha... \n\nWe sat down at the bar and the bartenders outnumbered us. Several of them seemed busy, serving the few customers other than us around the bar. Then our bartender came over, who didn't appear to have any customers as yet, so you would think he'd be happy for the business, but instead gave us an attitude like we were disrupting his relaxation time. My girlfriend asked what he would recommend from the drink menu, which is her MO as she generally doesn't bother with making decisions in unfamiliar territory and relies on what the employees like. Instead of naming off a few drinks or his favorite, or heck, the most expensive thing on the menu because if he'd had the brains to say it she probably would have just bought it, he made some snarky comment about reading the menu. Okay dude, you are on the clock right? Like, this is your job, right? So she ordered a shooter and a margarita, which was overpriced and she said it wasn't that great. Her cousin ordered a flamboyant purple drink that came in a big fishbowl souvenir cup and was smoking with dry ice. It looked really cool and was a big hit but of course was overpriced. Don't know what the husband ordered. For my part I ordered a Monster in the can, which cost $7.00. Outrageous. \n\nOn top of that, he mocked my GF's cousin when he asked how we'd like the bill, she clearly stated and gestured that she and her husband would be together. I'm hearing impaired and I could hear her say it, two people down the bar. He copied her gesture and said \"I don't know what this means,\" all snippy. All four of us looked at each other like, What's this guy's problem? Did we mistakenly end up at Dicks?  We are literally his only customers! I guess he was either having a bad night or just doesn't like making money. He didn't get any of ours.\n\nIt was so awkward after that, we left. I guess the angry bartender had the night off the previous night, because he was clearly not bringing the party on Friday. So we went somewhere else. None of us will be back."

After that, we switched to frozen margaritas, which were far better. I would have gone with 3 stars, but the service was just plain bad.

We had the breakfast burrito, and the guac and salsa were both clearly straight from the grocery store.  The coffee tasted like poorly made Maxwell House, and the oj definitely wasn't fresh squeezed.  The service took forever, and it wasn't worth the wait.  Maybe this stuff is better when you're either drunk or hungover?  When totally sober, you should definitely opt for something else.  Even just sticking with Starbucks would have been a much safer option (and cheaper, too!)."

They have 86'd the Flair Bartenders, which was a really nice touch, and added tremendously to the party atmosphere. \nI called and made a reservation for a party of 10 for a birthday surprise.  They asked for a call back number, and I was careful to give only my CEL number - since I live with the \"surprisee\".   About 45 minutes later, our HOME phone rang.  It was Kahunaville, confirming the reservation.  Apparently, they used the number from caller ID, and not the one I had given them.  (Kind of sneaky) Fortunately, I had grabbed the phone, so the surprised wasn't ruined.  (Strike one)\nWe arrived 5-10 minutes early, then had to wait almost 20 min for them to get our table ready.  The waitress arrived, and took drink orders.  Only one person (the guest of honor) ordered an alcoholic beverage - a frozen margarita.  The sodas arrived quickly.  Over the next 20 minutes, the waitress came back 3 or 4 times to say that the margarita would be \"right up\".  (Strike two)\nThe food arrived in SMALL groups of  3-4 items spread out over nearly TEN MINUTES!!  Several of us had cold food, as we waited for everyone to be served.  Two of the orders were wrong, and had to be sent back. (NOT the kind of service one would expect from a Featured Restaurant in a Major Strip Hotel!  That was STRIKE THREE!)\nThe food was mediocre, at best.  That was partially due to the stuff sitting and getting cold, while we waited for the service to be completed.  (Cold coconut-pineapple gravy atop a barely warm piece of chicken just ISN'T very tasty!). I ordered the Teryaki Flank Steak, cooked medium.  It was so tough that it was impossible to TEAR some of it apart, let alone try to cut it with the dull dinner knife.   By the time waitress returned to check on us, many of the people had finished eating.   I told the waitress about the condition of my steak.  She asked if I wanted to re-order.   Not wanting to make the whole party wait, and watch me eat by myself, I declined.  That was the last I heard, until I got a quick \"I told 'them' about the steak\" after the check arrived.  They hadn't taken it off of the bill, nor did they offer any other type of compensation.  (A small dessert, even a scoop of ice cream for the Birthday Guest would have been a nice gesture.  NOTHING). \nThe next day I called and spoke to the Manager.  She listened to my complaints, and her first comment was that I 'should have said something to the manager at our table   when they COULD have done something about it'.  I told her that no one, except the waitress, had come to our table.  Finally, she said that she would 'look into it' and get back to me in a few minutes to \"make this right\"  She took my phone number, but I don't know why.  She never called back.  No problem - I know ten guests (and everyone they tell) who will never GO back!"

On our first night in town, instead of hitting up a nightclub, we opted to go to Kahunaville for drinks. It's always a party at K-Ville. Between the flair bartenders, the live band, karaoke, tropical inspired cocktails and music/music videos, I always have fun.\n\nThey have an extensive drink menu with speciality cocktails. Frozen margaritas (complete with gummy worm garnish), huge smoking cocktails served in a glass bigger than my head, or even just beer or a well drink, they got something for everyone. My friends even asked the bartender for a cup of gummy worms and they hooked it up. My favorite cocktail is the Luau Lemonade. It taste exactly like cherry lemonade from Hot Dog on a Stick. I kid you not. It's made with citrus vodka and some other mixers. Don't be fooled by the great tasting cocktails, they do creep up on you. A few rounds later we were all pretty drunk and having a blast. The live band sang a weird but fun mix of songs (from Usher and Snoop Dog to George Clinton) and they definitely kept the party going. \n\nThere's also a restaurant located in the back. The menu is like a Island T.G.I.Fridays. While the food in the restaurant was a bit overpriced and had small portions, the bar itself is worth a visit. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and don't feel like dressing up to go to a crowded nightclub, head over to Kahunaville, sit back, order a few cocktails and enjoy the show. I wish we had one of these in California."

The bar itself wasn't even open yet, so why were they seating people in the bar area when there were tons of open tables in the restaurant. Very puzzling.\n\nThe waitress was not attentive at all. She took my order and brought me my drink, but then someone else actually brought me my food. The waitress did come back to refill my soda, but did so without saying a word. Didn't ask how the food was or anything. Then she dropped off my check with my soda refill without asking if I wanted anything else. Basically what I am getting at here, is the service was absolutely horrible. But wait, it actually gets worse!\n\nMy check came to $12 and change (I don't remember the actual amount). I paid  with a $20 and she brought me back an even $7. She just kept the coin change.

And it's just $37.\" Welp, it was worth a shot, but I would not return. Even with a coupon. \n\nWe walked in on a Sunday night at 7:30 and it was pretty empty. The menu contains some appealing items. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken on top of penne and my boyfriend ordered the Teriyaki Steak. We both ordered a regular frozen margarita (we could only choose between a margarita or a colada). The drinks arrived. They were tall and contained an extra shot glass of tequila. Score! This made me happy. Until I took a sip. I think they would have achieved the same thing if they brought a gallon of sour mix to our table and poured it down my throat. Ew. I don't know how anyone could drink those. It was the equivalent of eating a million sour patch kids. Even with the shot of tequila. \n\nOkay, so the drinks are bad. Bummer. How about the food? The salads were generic and nothing special. Now to the food: Once the parmesan crusted chicken was placed in front of me, it looked like a sloppy mess. I'm not one to get caught up on looks. If it tastes good, I couldn't care, but this didn't taste very good either. It is basically chicken parm on penne and of the caliber you would find at a Norm's or some other kind of diner. I honestly make a better parmesan crusted chicken. Seriously. After a few bites, I had no desire to finish my food. My boyfriend enjoyed his dish, but he also said it was nothing spectacular. Now, I wasn't expecting fireworks with a chicken parmesan, but if I had paid regular price for this, I would've. been. PISSED. \n\nOur waitress was very nice and attentive at first, but towards the end of our meal she just disappeared and we were forced to ask another woman for help. The redemption of our Living Social Deal was extremely easy, so I'm grateful for that, but that's the only thing I'm grateful for. Oh, I'm grateful for not paying full price for this huge miss. \n\nDo yourselves a favor and hit up something else.

I was underwhelmed by the food and so was everyone else at the table. The tiki theme was alright and the drinks were decent; however there were something lacking at Kahunaville. Speaking of lacking... I was shocked how key ingredients were missing in the menu for their drinks. Case in point shaved coconut in one of their signature drinks. Now i know that most tiki drinks have some sort of coconut but there are plenty for those who can't have coconut. I'm lucky enough that I took a look at my drink before having a sip or I would've partied in Sin City in the ambulance. \n\nI was also surprised how big of a deal they made to split the checks when the restaurant wasn't even packed. Actually I should've taken heed of the attendance in the restaurant before walking in. We were starving and couldn't walk anymore before trying to eat our straws in our drinks.\n\nThis place also shocked me when I ordered a side dish of mac n' cheese and literally received a lump of kraft box, orange dyed, clumped mac n' cheese. The potatoes tasted like they were from the box and most of the main dishes were just bland. A chicken plate where the grilled chicken has no seasoning is crazy. If I didn't know better I would've thought this was me in my own kitchen.

My boyfriend and I went here with a Groupon that you could get two entrees, two salads, and two cocktails. We also chose this place because we were going to see Jo Koy perform there at Treasure Island. I had a ceasar salad that was quite tasty, but his house salad had too much bitter leaves and hardly any dressing. We both opted for the ribs & chicken because it seemed the safest choice with least dissapointment. The chicken and ribs were cooked very well and were moist and flavorful! There was a good bbq-jerk flavor to them. Our cocktails were decent as well, and while I appreciate the hookup with extra liquor it kind of killed the flavor. Overall experience was good though. We ended with pineapple upside down cake that came with ice cream and it was delicious. I would check out this place if you happen to be on the strip or staying there, but not a place I would venture out to. The Groupon made the price reasonable since (as most places in casinos) the price for everything seemed jacked up for the tourists."

Sitting in the bar area, our server was friendly, and we all ordered a round of sugary frozen cocktails (covered by a Groupon). All of the drinks were quite sweet, which I guess is expected. The frozen lime margarita was okay, but the strawberry was almost undrinkable due to being saccharine sweet, but I guess that is typically of slushy-machine drink. They were out of Mango, which was really disappointing to 3 of our group.  We ordered 2 appetizers also, so combat the sugar rush. The hummus was ok, but came with very few flatbread. The artichoke dip was just ok. Overall, maybe I'd come back for the evening show, but I wouldn't come for drink or food again."

My friend arranged a group dinner for 30 people and only 26 people came, but they INSISTED we pay for the 4 entrees because she had agreed to it in an email.  A very long email with lots of small print--the salesperson should have ensured that she saw it.  Even so, the manager was an obnoxious twit. It appeared as though he thought if you attached \"ma'am\" to the end of your sentence you could say anything and still be considered polite.  Wrong.  When we informed him that he didn't have to worry about the servers; that we would tip them on the full 30 entrees he said \"I'm not worried about the servers, I'm worried about the company\".  Charming. He must be great to work for.  A positive note**the bartender up front by the door made excellent mojitos. However, when we ordered them at the table they came with sprite or club soda or something in them.  The server was a little put out about me asking for a replacement.  Then she said she could only replace mine as the others had already taken too many sips.  Anyway, finally another manager comes by and says that we don't have to pay for the other 4 entrees...so it would seem as though the first manager just wanted to prove a point.  THEN; the food was just so-so.  All of the hassle would have been worth it (maybe) if we had gotten a spectacular dish but all the meals were very forgettable.  We were celebrating some friends' 50th birthday and the manager's loathsome behavior really put a damper on the evening.  There are just too many choices of dining spots to ever pick this one.\n\nOh, and I told the manager that I had been in food service for years and was it really worth the price of 4 entrees to have 26 dissatisfied customers; especially with sites like Yelp* out there?  His response: even 5 star restaurants get bad reviews.     Yeah, but their food is good."

It came with potatoes and a slice of fresh watermelon. \n\nThis morning we had the stuffed french toast and it's the best I've had. It was nice and crispy on the outside just the way I like it! I definitely recommend it.\n\nYou can sit outside by the pool and take in the scenery!"

Service was excellent considering that the one server who helped us out was able to satisfy the requests of just about everyone in my party. The food was really good and visually outstanding as it was decorated very island-esque. I wish there was a little bit more variety in the menu, but I guess you can have confidence in anything you choose here because the few items that they do have are delicious! \n\nI'm glad that we randomly decided to eat here. It was definitely an undiscovered pleasure that we all found satisfying."

After wrestling with options, we settled in on coconut shrimp and the pi\u00f1a colada chicken. \n\nNow for the main reason I was here -the rum. 1 Pirates booty for me and a tiki torch for him.\n\nHere's where it starts getting fuzzy.\n\nI remember the rice being cooked perfectly. The shrimp were fresh and not over cooked. You had better love coconut because the force was strong with this one. We kicked ourselves for ordering two coconut dishes, our fault. The pina colada chicken was moist and had plenty of sauce, which was pretty sweet and very rich. I tried to focus on the vegetables but everything was getting blurry.\n\nWhat was in those drinks?!? We had originally planned to hit up a tiki bar afterwards but I quickly realized that after just one drink - all I wanted to do was go back to the rooftop of our hotel & take in the empyrean glow of the strip. \n\nService was good and we were seated right away, no complaints there. They say that Kahuna can be defined as a \"priest, sorcerer, magician, wizard, expert in any profession.\" Who ever made those drinks is definitely the Big Kahuna in my Kahunaville."

Bobby got the slider sampler and he enjoyed his meal. i wasnt nuts about the chicken sliders but he liked them so thats what matters. both came with seasoned fries which were addicting!  we were tempted by dessert, especially the ice cream sundae which looks incredible but we were boarderline stuffed and i think the sundae would have put us over the edge. the bill was higher then we would pay at home but its Vegas so we epxected prices to be higher. \n\ni would definitly go back just for the crab cakes\n\nthe music and water show was also very cool. when we first got there the show was in progress so the lights were dim and the tropical sounds were going so i was nervous this place would be like the Rainforest cafe (which i hate with the fire of a thousand suns) but i was pleasantly suprised."

We both thought it was pretty cool how they put the dry ice into the drink, which made smoke and made the drink bubble.

The original plan was to head over to RA sushi for happy hour, but the convenience of not having to walk over the bridge in the cold lead us in, against our better judgment.\n\nHostess = very rude. This should have been warning enough to turn around and leave. We were ignored for a few minutes before being lead to our table, were we then waited another 10 minutes for our equally rude waitress to acknowledge our presence, breaking the news:\n\nAlthough though the coupon girl assured us that we - party of 5 - could each use one of the free drink  or  2-for-1 drink offers she handed us, we found that not to be the case once inside. One free drink coupon OR the 2-for-1 entree coupon would have to be shared amongst us. Bait and switch much? especially because she made it a point to hand each of us our own pile of worthless paper. We should have left then...\n\nBecause we had a guest-list invite across town, and didn't want to waste anymore time walking in heels to find another dinner spot, we stuck around in the interest of saving time. BIG MISTAKE. After dropping the no-coupon bomb on our table, the very rude waitress disappeared for another 10 minutes - at this point I should mention that we were 1 of about 3 parties in the whole place, and there was another waitress working in addition to bar tenders, and bussers - Growing impatient, we ordered our own drinks from the bar and brought them back to the table, using a 2-for-1 and a free drink coupon amongst 3 of us. We got back to the table and the waitress, seeing our drinks, rolled her eyes sarcastically snapping at us \"I see you're all set on drinks\". we should have left then, but of course, didn't. Rude waitress proceeded to take our order for two entrees and an appetizer to be split. She disappears for another 10 minutes.   \n\nUpon returning, the waitress hands us a check for just the appetizer, and tells us that she's clocking out and the bar will be handling our order from here on out. I would later find out that we had reached the transition from full menu to \"late night $5 menu\"  in the 45+ minutes we had spent waiting around inside the restaurant.  Puzzled, I went up to the bartender we had ordered our drinks from and explained that we were confused as to what happened with our entrees (whether or not they were still available, or if the order had been put in etc) and then told him \"it's no big deal, we'll order a few more $5 appetizers, if that's all that's available\". The bartender had NO clue as to what was going on and said he'd find his manager to \"take care of it\" \n\n\"finally\" I thought, \"someone who can figure this all out\" \n\nBy the time the manager made it to our table, we had been waiting in the restaurant for nearly an hour. Our appetizer (the nachos, which weren't half bad, but definitely not enough to split 5 ways) had arrived via another waitress who - not surprisingly - had no clue as to what had happened to our entree order and couldn't help us with ordering more appetizers. Keeping with, what I can only assume now is company policy for staff/customer relations, the manager was extremely rude. We explained the situation, told him we were in a hurry, and that we didn't care if we got the entrees or not but did need to feed everyone in our group asap - as we had a set time to meet a promoter. We got a short and annoyed response from the manager, who said he'd check it out and be right back, which he was 5 minutes later to let us know the entrees were on the way. \"great\" I though...\n\nFast forward nearly 30 minutes later, and STILL no entrees. Most annoyingly, the original waitress who was helping us had walked past our table 4 or 5 times while helping rope off the area we're still sitting in STARVING. Our single appetizer was gone, our mediocre drinks were gone, and we decided to follow suit. On the way out the door, the manager blocked our path, saying, in a Creepy Mc Creeperton tone \"where are you going, your entrees will be out in 2 minutes\". Another party member - fed up - reminded him that we'd been waiting 45 minutes since our \"waitress\" took  said order, pushing past, as I barked over my shoulder \"I'm totally yelping this B.S.\"\n\nso here I am... \n\n1)  I know this wasn't indented to be a gourmet dining experience.\n2)  Yes, I know it's at T.I.\n3)  I'm aware of regular coupon policies.  \n\nbut seriously!\n\nPressed for time, we ended up having a taxi driver drop us off at Sonic across the street from The Palms. When I'm actually choosing to eat Sonic over any other establishment, it should speak pretty loudly and clearly as to how EXTREMELY BAD, the experience was.\n\nI would however rate the teenage, minimum wage earners at Sonic 1000 x better than the folks here!"

The music just kept getting LOUDER AND LOUDER to where we couldn't even have a conversation. The reggae version of Hotel California really did crack me up. The \"water show\" was quite pitiful. I love the idea, but some lame jungle music did not enhance the experience. If you really want it to be an attraction then get some hula dancers or fire twirlers, etc. Make it a real show. \nThe food was hit and miss. I had the pina colada chicken and I thought it was very good. The coconut and pineapple sauce was just right, not overpowering. The chicken was breaded, but not dry or tough. The hibachi veggies were julienned and very delicious. My daughter had the chicken parm and she said it was okay...the pasta that came with it was very bland. Our friends daughter had mac and cheese off the kids menu with french fries. Very disappointed that for $7 all she got was microwave macaroni with powered cheese from a BOX! Her mom had the chicken caesar salad and did not eat very much as it was not tasty. Overall disappointment. We went with a Living Social deal, but I wouldn't even bother ever again."

I didn't know what to order so I decided on the mini sandwich sampler. They were all pretty terrible except for the french dip. My friend ordered a crab cake sandwich for I have no idea what reason. As stupid as it is to order a crab cake in the desert, it was as bad as you'd expect. It was pretty expensive and inedible. My boyfriend got the Cuban and it was confusingly bad. It was dry but oily? We were cheap asses and took it home, it was better cold and dipped in ranch or ketchup.\n\nThe only plus was that the bartender let us use a second coupon for a free drink. Not bad drinks.."

And what a place it was. Think a Rainforest Cafe without the children and an oxygen bar (I still don't get Vegas' fascination with those), then add many different random aspects and there you are. \n\nSo anyways, I used a 2 for one drink deal, and got my mom a margarita while I had a bottled beer. The bartender was very nice and tried to make conversation after seeing I was from Missouri (do I look like I go to Mizzou?!). He also did some flaring which was entertaining to watch (I have rarely been in a bar where they flair so that one was easy). However, the quality of my mother's drink was meh. It looked like he just opened up a frozen mix and plunked it in without any alcohol. This also came with a separate shot of tequila, which makes me think like they didn't try with mixing anything. My beer was good, but that's because they didn't have to make it or handle it outside of cracking one open...\n\nSo overall, I would say avoid or think of them when you think you want a good deal in Vegas."

Especially their Paradise Sampler. That right there, just fills you up. If that doesn't fill you up, most likely their big portion of food probably will. But their sampler, has everything on the Appetizer menu, plus a smoking volcano, literally, a smoking volcano. No matter how many times we asked or that our friends asked, you can't take home the volcano. The presentation of the Paradise Sampler is something you'll remember about Kahunaville. \n\nUsually you would probably get full from the Paradise Sampler, but there's always more, much more. One time I ordered a chicken wrap, which I would thought it would be something small. Unfortunately its a big ass chicken wrap, probably as big as your foot, or close to it. But overall, they have big portions and sure enough it will surely fill you up, if the sampler didn't. \n\nThe place itself is very nice, very colorful. One room has the bar, and there's another room that has a mini water show. It is very roomy and spacious that you won't have a problem moving around. \n\nI recommend this place, for its food and its scenery. The Paradise Sampler is always my preferred Appetizer, it just amaze me on when they bring it out, that the volcano is smoking. Even though I know its just dry ice and water, but it add pizazz to the presentation. Kahunaville is truly, one of a kind restaurant."

My hubs had the bang bang shrimp, the only bang thing about it, was that he wanted to bang his head on the table because they were terrible.

Wilted and browning romaine lettuce with about 5 slices of ahi does not warrent $14.95 in my book.  And $14.95 was one of the cheapest prices on the menu. For a place that reminded me of a Hawaiian themed TGI Friday's, that's insane.\n\nThen they had some cheesy bartender flair competition going on while I tried my best to digest my salad and the entire place got noisy as hell. I will admit, that was our fault for choosing to dine in the bar area.  Not a good place to dine if you plan on having a conversation that entails more than just \"Woooo!\"  and \"Owwwww!\" and hand clapping and high fiving.  \n\nI gave one star for the great, strong melon margaritas (I had two) and another for the nice bracelet I purchased from the gal walking around selling leis.   I know Treasure Island isn't known for their restaurants as other hotel/casinos are on the strip, but COME ON.  You gotta be able to do better than that."

The waiter Aaron was friendly, took pictures for us, had our drinks filled the whole time, and even made sure our glasses were full so we could take them with us when we left.  We ordered the 25 dollar mega appitizer that comes with a ceramic volcano erupting with dry ice.  The nachos were amazing.  We filled up on the appitizer, it was so good.  It was fun watching the bartender toss up the bottles trying to flair and drop them.  It was a fun place to have lunch with my friend on her birthday."

They were handing out a \"buy one get one free\" coupon so we decided to take advantage of it.\n\nThis place totally reminds me of somewhere I would have gone when freshly 21. I wouldn't know any better and I'd think the super fruity, sugary filled drinks were the best. I don't think like that now. Now that I'm older, wiser, and have a more refined palate, I gag when I drink an overly fruity concoction. \n\nThen add to the fact that during the flair bartending they played stuff like \"Zombie Nation\" and similar songs. Oh jeebus.\n\nThose are the \"ugh\" parts. \n\nThe funny parts happened during the flair bartdening itself. Some of the tricks were pretty good, other times they dropped stuff but it was funny. Add to it that one bartender asked me if I liked cherries. Without thinking I said \"yes\". He then put whipped cream on top of his bald head, stuck a cherry on it, then stuck his head out over the bar for me to eat it. \n\n...\n\nI'm glad my boyfriend was a good sport because it was so in the moment that I felt like I HAD to eat the cherry.\n\n...\n\nSo anyway, there was that, and everyone got free shots out of it. Overly fruity shots, but they were FREE.\n\nIt'd be 2-stars because really, it's so ridiculous that you shouldn't come here seriously looking for a happening spot. But if you can get a coupon and get an extra free shot out of it, it can't be all that bad, right?\n\nJust watch out for the whipped cream and cherry on top of a bald bartenders head. Don't just say \"yes\" to things in the moment. Okay? Okay."

First of all I think I was instantly turned off that this Hawaiian themed restaurant had about 0% of Aloha in their menu....I mean I wasn't expecting an authentic hawaiian meal but I was thinking there would be some sort of commercialized Panda Express/Bahama Breeze attempt at it? Or even a few Musubi's would have shut me up when it comes to questioning why this place went with a Hawaiian theme....but seriously the only Aloha in this place was the jungle print menu...that being said they could add a few more fish tanks and called this place the Rain Forest Cafe. However there is two reasons why I ended up here as many times (3 times to be exact) as I did and thats because I was staying in treasure Island and I had a coupon. \n\nI've been to plenty of restaurants where service is non existent and it doesn't bother me because usually there is some yummy food that more than makes up for it. I understand why some places may not have the best of service for reasons such as being understaffed, cultural differences (In some cultures if a waitress is constantly coming to your table it means they want you to leave rather than enjoy your food & chat with your party), or just simply not well trained. However when it comes to a Chain like restaurant in a Casino one would think that basics courtesy would be the standard? Not for 2 out of my 3 experience\n\nMy first experience our waitress seemed to be....off in her own world? the place wasn't busy at all but she seemed preoccupied with something ....just not sure what it was. The plastic cups for our beverages was kind of a turn off as well. My Chicken burger was super dry and all the kahuna bbq sauce in the world could not save it...and believe me I TRIED SO HARD! lol\n\nThe 2nd time I came here for a drink and the bartender literally took 10 minutes to get to me because he was dancing behind the counter? and the place was dead with only like 3 people sitting at the bar. When the bartender finally took my drink order he totally got it wrong because I wanted one of those cool long margarita glasses and instead got a 10 oz disposable cup......fail....\n\nMy last experience was breakfast out by the pool....this experience was a lot better! The food was good, our server was actually happy to see us, and made an effort to make us feel welcomed.\n\nall in all my last experience is the only reason this place got two stars instead of one....however if you don't have a coupon there are better places on the strip to spend your money."

A couple of them were decent and we got a few laughs but there were a couple of them that were awful, and I almost felt bad for them. If you don't have anything better to do you should check out this comedy place because it's worth seeing at least you can get free tickets on houseseats.com. You can also get tickets to Laugh Factory at houseseats.com and I think we're going to try that next.

The drinks were good and pretty stiff for the prices.\n\nHowever, the food absolutely SUCKED. Some of the appetizers we had such as the nachos and mozerella sticks were good but its pretty hard to mess those up.  The entries are close to $20 a piece, and just didn't taste very good. The Teriyaki Steak was way too sweet and spicy cashew chicken was better at panda express.\n\nThey also charged us a 18% gratituity even though we only had a party of 5. When asked why, it was because it was a special event due to the fight. \n\nBe on the lookout for coupons since they usually have a girl passing them out at the escalator adjacent to the restaurant.  This can range from anything from Buy 1 Get 1 Free drinks to Half Price Dinner Entries.\n\nI'd come here again only if i was watching the fight.

There is a shrimp entree that comes with this delicious curry-like sauce and the steak salad was pretty good too. They are not frugal on their portions so you will definitely walk away full! The bartender was really cool and well traveled who checks up on his bar people often.\n\nCons: There isn't anything too special about the food and the decor is kind of cheesy like the rain forest cafe (but without the aquarium). \n\nOverall: For what you get on the strip, this a pretty decent deal though there are many other more interesting restaurants in my opinion."

Reasonably priced at $50.00 a person it included reserved table and all you can eat buffet, that was dark by half time, which was fine with us ( my boyfriend and I) because that was when we had to leave due to him having slight chest pains and numbness in his left arm ( not caused by anything done or served by the restaurant) Unfortunately we could not locate our server to let her know that we were leaving, not surprising because we really didn't see much of her while we were there. I had ordered a Big Kahuna drink when we first arrived at 1:30 (approximately 2 hours prior to kickoff and the place was already starting to fill up. Reservations had been sold out three weeks prior to the event but if you weren't in your seats by kickoff your seats were resold and you were still charged unless you cancelled 48-72 hours prior.) and waited over 20 minutes for it to be delivered. It was served in a yard stick type glass and I was told I would get a second one for free since they were out of the fish bowl that it was typically served in that was larger than the cup used and that sounded good to me. The drink was pretty strong but really good when it finally arrived. I ordered the second one right before halftime and it was delivered by another waitress. I had taken a couple of sips when my boyfriend indicated that he was not feeling well. We looked around for our waitress or any other one nearby and couldn't locate one. He really started to panic to we left knowing that she had already charged us for our admission and my drink ( which was $30.00) and my boyfriend's bucket of Bud Lights ( which shocked us at $42.00) the total she charged on the card was $186.02 that he signed. He thought that going up to the room and lying down might help him feel better but we ended up and the emergency room at Sunrise Hospital that evening. He is fine by the way, that was until we saw our bank statement this morning. There was a charge for $225.34 on February 8 from Kahunaville ( apparently she believed her service, or lack thereof, deserved a little more than 20% tip of 39.32) As a bartender/ server, I realize that a lot of times this is added automatically to large parties or special events but generally you can speak to a manager or someone to have it removed if service was not up to par. However, we didn't get back to the hotel after leaving the hospital until almost 2:00/ 2:30 in the morning and the restaurant was closed permanently by then. I called Treasure Island this morning but they were not associated Kahunaville and could not help except to suggest calling the bank to stop payment, which we had planned to do after the call to the hotel. Very disappointed that an establishment that knew they were closing didn't leave a way to contact them for a couple of days afterwards for things like this that could have occurred!"

Somewhat tropical setting with a sports bar type of feel.\n\nWith that said, they had a pretty good oxygen bar. It was the last night of four that my buddies and I were staying in April 2009. The girl working there hooked us up to a few of those oxygen tubes and gave us a shot of flavored vodka (Smirnoff shot bottle of your choice) and a can of Monster to dump it in. It was kinda funny in the sense that here we are trying to get over our hangovers and they just give us more liquor, but it is Vegas, lol. \n\nAfter inhaling and exhaling for a few minutes, she gave each of us back massages with some sort of vibrating massage device. My buddies and I sipped on our drinks and talked while she made her rounds on us. The oxygen flavors came in four which you breathe simultaneously. You could turn down the notch of one flavor so you could smell another one a bit better. Honestly, I couldn't really tell the difference between any of them. After the massages she would use a tingly wire device to massage our heads.\n\nLater during the massage, a cute little girl in a little Hula costume of some sort came around selling lays and beads. We bought some and socialized a bit and then it was over. The overall experience was just ok because it was my second oxygen bar during the trip and I had a better one to compare it to.\n\nIf you want to visit a kick ass oxygen bar, go to the one at Fashion Show Mall, they explain more of the devices that they use and do a few extra things (no, not what you're thinking, lol) including a small wired machine that stimulates your muscles and scented oils you can inhale. The name of the girl at Fashion Show was Nicole and she did an awesome job! I forgot the name of the oxygen bar at FSM, so I can't yelp it. If you know it, let me know! Thanks!"

That's the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5.  \n\nGood place and we would definitely be back here."

We were lucky enough to have her wait on us twice, we loved her!  Food here is good, drinks are great!  You just can't beat sitting outside in the sun by the pool having a bite to eat!  The first time we had a breakfast burrito and chorizo scramble, both were good.  The second time we had steak and eggs and eggs benedict, both were fantastic!  Seriously, we could've eaten another order of the eggs benedict, yum!  Potatoes are just ok, wish they served hash browns instead.  A couple of the dishes came with thick slices of toast which were excellent also!  If you're staying at Treasure Island, this is a must visit!"

The bartenders show was great fun (total cheese, but fun all the same) and we got free shots out of the deal!\n\nThe food is acceptable normal bar type food (lots of deep fried whatevers) and the drinks are a little overpriced (when it comes from a machine, I think I should pay less), but it was still perfect for the night we were hoping to have."

The bartenders THOUGHT they were much cooler then they really are and TRIED to flair but it just wound up to be watching some guys drop bottles all over the floor.....anyhooo.....the drinks are good...not cheap but yummy for tropical fruity drinks.

Burger definitely seemed larger than a quarter pounder, probably closer to a third of a pound.  \n\nI didn't get one of their signature drinks but tried a bit of it and it was great!

A 1 star breakfast and 5 star dinner.\n \nEven though I woke up buzzed when my friend & I met up with my sister and her friends for breakfast, I wasn't out of it enough to not know where I was or what was going on.  Yeah, sitting by the poolside, watching the scantily clad mid-day scenery was nice and sobering, but that was about it.  It took us ten minutes to get seated (seeing almost every table was empty) another twenty minutes to get water and place an order, and about another 45 minute wait to actually see the food in front of us.  The food was super salty, from the eggs to the potatoes to the ham and bacon, all of it was dryer than the Nevada sand.  The service was as stale as the toast that accompanied the meals.   \n \nBy comparison, dinner here was quite a treat.  My friend wanted to go somewhere to watch the UFC night that night, and since we noticed that this place did not charge a cover when we visited here in the morning, we decided why not give it another go.  We showed up about ten minutes before the fight began and were seating immediately.  There was a $25 minimum purchase required to get a table, but that was not a problem for the two us looking for some grub and beers.\n \nThere wasn't a bad seat in the house for the viewing.  They had enough televisions and projectors mounted to ensure that every seat had a good view of the action.  Definitely a good spot to watch any type of televised event.\n \nAs for the eats, we both went in the surf & turf combo (shrimp and steak) and both were mighty good.  The medium steak was cooked perfectly.  The shrimp were jumbo large and tasty.   Considering it was packed house, the services was great - the food came out quick, and beer mugs were kept full.  \n\nA good meal overall, I'd come back again in the future for dinner, as their \"A\" game was on during the evening.  Hell, even if I were a townie, I'd consider coming here."

After every other restaurant was 30-45 minute wait in treasure island we saw this place and tried to stop in to get a quick bite. I think they must of had 2 servers on because they had a bunch of open tables but yet their was still a 10 minute wait. Because we were starving we went to the bar where we waited about 10 minutes before even getting a glass of water. After making it clear to the bartender that we were ready to order and hungry, he took his time to get over to us and take out order. Now as for the food, it was disgusting. We ordered mini burgers which was basically 1 burger that they cut into four pieces and put on little rolls. I mean how cheap can you be, that you'll cut up a burnt  burger and call it sliders??? We also had spinach dip. This was literally the driest dip , and had a yellow tint to it. Finally when we were ready to leave, the bartender had left the bar for about 20 minutes and never came back. It took another 10 minutes to ask waitresses to print our bill. The food was disgusting and within 20 minutes of leaving the hotel i got sick because my stomach couldn't handle how fowl the food was.

We had a reservation and were led through a busy, brightly neon-lighted bar and dancing area, to an empty dining room.  We were told that the kitchen had last-call at 10:45pm and ordered as quickly as we could!\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waitress was very understanding and patient with such a large group. I was on a 3-week vegetarian fast and had questions about the oil they use to fry the french fries. When I asked, she answered, \"I think regular olive oil?\" but didn't really bother to check with the kitchen, which I wish she tried harder to accommodate. But other than that, she was pretty polite and quick with service, as well as checking on us throughout our meal.\n\n\nFOOD:\nI requested the waitress to pick a drink that she recommended and she brought me the Green Iguana ($9) which was SO GOOD! It tasted like blue Jello but would be potent as their advertised \"Kahuna-fied\" sized drinks =)\nIn addition to that, my boyfriend and I ordered:\n\nBig Island Salad ($13), was alright. The dressing was fruity-tangy and the salad had large amounts of strawberries, mandarin oranges coconut, and pineapples. It was supposed to have mozzarella and provolone to balance the flavors. There was not much of either but I love fruit so it was satisfying for me.\n\nKahuna BBQ Chicken ($10), my boyfriend loved that it had BBQ chicken, ham and cheese inside and I tried his french fries which were really very good and thin and crispy. I could've ate a bowlful of their fries. Really good.\n\n& some other Kahuna-fied purple drink ($25), which was good but not as great as the Green Iguana.\n\nOur bill came out to almost $400, with a $62 gratuity included. Not at all bad for a location on the Strip and with a meal for 14.\n\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nOverall, a fun party place draped tackily with jungle decorations and a fake waterfall along one wall. People in our party also bought lei's in order to be able to get the BOGO margaritas, beer and coladas. It was all tacky, but in a touristy, fun way; and since it was intended to be tacky, it was fun to just kickback and let loose in the jungle!"

This place is a mix of really cheesy, really chintzy, and down right sleezy. The music is so loud you can feel your skin vibrate to the music. The bar has video poker in front of EVERY seat, so unless you want to stare at a glowing TV screen, you have to sit at a table. I got a frozen rasberry margarita which tasted like absolute crap, full of artificial grossness. The boy got a regular margarita which wasn't too bad, was actually kind of strong, but still not worth the miserable atmosphere. The flair bartenders are friendly and fun to watch, but kind of seemed burned out and not horribly interested in their job which just made me feel bad for them.\n\nWhen you first walk in there is an oxygen bar located to the side. On a different day we decided to check it out since we had never done the oxygen thing before, but just felt really uncomfortable the entire time. The girl that worked the bar was really weird, fake, and over friendly. For 20 bucks you get use of the oxygen tanks (they have 4 different flavors to chose from, but they all just smell like a weird sweet plastic smell) you get a massage from the girl, and you get a monster energy drink. For some people I can see how they would think this was fun and a pretty sweet deal, but we just felt awkward and skipped out before she could come massage us! Didn't go for the energy drink either, but only because we don't like the taste. Oh yea, and besides feeling a little dizzy, I didn't feel rejuvenated or more alert and awake like they say you're supposed to. Neither did the boy. Oh well, it was worth a try!"

Thank you Kahunaville Management Team.\n____\n\nYack, wretch, what the hell are these people thinking??  I couldn't find the \"no star\" option, so I'll stick with one.\n\nWhere do I begin.....\n\nLate lunch, not very busy, we were seated in the bar area at a table in the back.\n\nOrdered the wedge salad, nachos and the sandwich sampler.\n\nWaited for quite a while for the wedge salad to appear, when it did, there was a metal screw in it, stuck to the blue cheese dressing.  I have no idea where in the heck this metal screw could have come from, but had I not seen it before ingesting, it could have been very upsetting.  That, along with the fact that I couldn't see any green under the mound of dressing, I asked for the replacement salad to have dressing on the side.  I guess the fact that the salad was drowned in dressing made it much easier to identify the metal screw.  \n\nDidn't finish the salad.  Was not good, red iceberg lettuce, clearly had been out for a while... Forgave the salad and waited for the rest our food FOREVER.\n\nWhen the sandwich sampler finally came out, at least 30 minutes after the salad (it's been about an hour overall) the so-called food on the plate was practically unrecognizable.  The sandwich buns were so hard you could throw them at a wall and see a dust cloud.  I had to point with my fork at items, and look to my wife to decipher what was on the plate.   We could barely identify the solidified pork ball with a white substance on top, but the other items, where a slather of gravy was involved, we can't tell you what it was. Maybe some dried up meat bits? a fried piece of something? all that and the fries were dried out and dark brown.  The nachos had the lowest quality cheese sauce on them possible and that coupled with the chef boyardee \"chili meat\" made us both say, that's it! We're outta here!\n\nI get it people, this primarily a bar, where people would primarily order bar food.  I love bars.  I love bar food.  This is not bar food, this is BARF FOOD.\n\nNow folks, I'm a big hearty kind of guy.  I'm not that picky about my food, but this was the first time, in my entire 41 years on this planet, that I actually left without eating a bite. My wife wanted to just walk out, but for karma's sake, I spent the next 10 minutes trying to find our server to pay for this horrific meal, so we could leave.  When she finally came to our table, do you think she asked why we were leaving two entire plates of food? drum rollllllllllll  nope! She just said, hey have a good day.  \n\nGross."

The whole time he was dropping F bombs and it was really uncomfortable.  I cuss like a sailor but to have someone do it in such an angry way was different.  Our visit just kept going downhill from there.  We were looking at the regular menu for some apps and he took the menu out of my friends hand to give it to a guy asking what beer they had.  Instead of just telling him what beer they had or getting another menu he took it away from her.  It was crazy.  When he brought our drinks he asked if we wanted to run a tab.  I looked at my friend cause I was ready to leave.  She said \"I don't care\"  \"It's up to you\" to me.  The bartender goes \"Well I care!\"  Like dude give us a sec.  I can't believe how rude this guy was.  We paid and left.  To bad because we planned on running through the whole menu and having a great night."

They were advertising $25 to watch the pay-per-view fight and there was a crowd of people at the front trying to get in.  I just squeezed to the front and asked the guy very politely if I could please just watch the Rampage/Evans fight, he checked my ID and let me and my husband in for free.  Cool!  Now, I want to eat here next time just because they were so nice."

Our friend had just purchased a Travelzoo Voucher where for $25 you get 6 drinks plus a free bartender show. Since we had arrived early, we thought we were not going to be able to see it because it only occurs a few times in the evening. Anyhow, $25 for 6 drinks is phenominal. We were initially greeted by a very nice hostess named Meena (I don't know how to spell her name, but she is the girlfriend of the bartender named Steve who we would meet later on in the evening) Our bartender Evan was quite nice to us. We were just drinking away having great conversation with each other while playing video blackjack on the tables.\n\nI really think too that especially if you are a hot female, you will be treated very well at this bar. Well, we finished our 6 drinks and started to meander around the casino. Well, my friend decides to use the restroom adjacent to the restaurant and she noticed that there was the bartender bottle show. She went back inside and this marketing manager of the bar named Lenny greets her. Our friend tells us to go back to the bar and we have more cocktails. We met Steve the bartender who is the girlfriend of the hostess that we met earlier. The girlfriends who were with me challenged Steve to show us his abs. Well, eventually he did and he did not disappoint with the washboard abs. This is a very laid back bar that had a very friendly vibe to it. I mean we actually interacted with many of the staff here because they were just so nice. We would definitely return back here again."

We had a groupon and were seated in the back room with a bunch of other tables at a table for 6 people (that was weird) by a sweet hostess.\nThe waiter came by (older man -name began with an 'A'. Strong accent) - asked if we wanted water and then went and got it.\nWhen he came back to ask what we wanted - he saw our 'coupon' (his words) showed us which items we could order from and then left the table (so far so good right?)\nWhen 'A\" came back, he took our order and our Groupon and walked away. :(\nThe Groupon included, non alcoholic drinks, salad and a meal for 2.\nHe never asked what we wanted on our salad for dressing and it took almost 25 minutes to get out meal. \nIn fact, I never once saw him come back out of the kitchen (yes, alas we were right in front of its entrance) no idea WHERE he went.\nwhen I went to see the hostess to ask what was going on- she acted as if I may not have been the only one wondering 'what happened to :\"A\" and ran back into the kitchen to find out where our meal was and where our salads were.\nLow and behold it came right out-SANS SALAD.\nWhen we called him on this he was very apologetic but brought us the salad AFTER dinner.\nThe Hostess has also mentioned she told the Manager on duty and that 'she would be by'. She never came by.\nWe went by the next day and I made it a point to tell THAT manager what had happened. Was not a great first impression of Treasure Island and its restaurants.\nShe did offer us lunch at the place that day ( we had already eaten) but still.\nI dont think Ill go here again- even if the food is pretty yummy."

I've been fooled over and over again..What does this mean about me? That I'm compulsive? I hope not.\nMy sister and I wanted to find a place to drink before heading off to a club and enticing coupons were offered. \"Buy one drink, and second one free\".\nAs we entered, the crowd was a mixture of middle-aged couples to groups of friends who looked 21. The bartenders did fancy tricks with bottles lke what I've seen in the movie \"Cocktails\", but much worse. They needed more practice, much more practice. The DJ/announcer kept yelling and trying to pump the crowd up, screaming \"who wants free shots? You gotta scream!\" \nIt's a pathetic rendition of the movie \"Cocktails\" and the food wasn't alll that great. At least the bartenders were nice and entertaining."

Personally I could've done without so much sugar because not only did I get drunk but I was on a sugar high. The drink was also strong, you could taste the alcohol, which I suppose is good since you get what you pay for, along with the half yard drink came 3 of those chemistry looking test tubes filled with alcohol, mine came with tequila and my friend's came with rum. So it was kinda cool that we got shots to take with our drinks, extra DRUNK! She even topped it off with gummy worms and cherries. \nSo thumbs up for getting me drunk but I rather would've gotten a Fat Tuesday, but because it was raining I didn't feel like walking"

They kind of fell off the bone but the sauce was a miss. As for the chicken it was very dry and smothered un that awful bbq sauce. Coleslaw was average and lacking flavor.\n\nAs for the drinks they were made by our server and we were thankful they were strong but they tasted awful.\n I would recommend this place for the bartenders performance and the occasional drink specials but eat at your own risk."

I dress up to go out and we meet at this place for pre-club drinks. The drinks are served in big neon plastic cups. Vanilla Ice is blaring in the distance.  We order our friend a drink that looks like a concoction that would appear in a witches cauldron. We laugh at the bubbling drink and wonder when it will stop.   It doesn't until it is empty. \n\nWe're bullshitting and drinking and so far the drinks have been a topic of conversation in and of themselves. That is until Tootsie Roll comes on.  The big girls at the table next to us climb onto any surface they can find and begin \"rolling.\"  The french guys we are with think this is what America is all about, bad music, tacky girls, vodka tonics served in yard sized plastic cups.  \n\nOverall entertaining making the club we went to after seem too ridiculously serious, but isn't that what Vegas is all about?"

Their breakfast burrito was enormous and I remembered that I was fighting to finish every last bite (because I don't like to waste food nor take it togo when I couldn't get to a microwave). This time around we had the teriyaki glazed chicken wings, the cuban sandwich and the island chicken wrap. The best plate was probably the wings...it was juicy, tasty, and leaves me wanting more. However, the wrap was a bit dry and the cuban sandwich was ok...I thought that the bread was too thick and I've had better cuban sandwiches before. We also ordered the tortilla soup...there was nothing special about it. \nThe service was great, our server was very attentive and nice."
