Flavorless and tough filet, and guest had a ribeye that was pure grizzle. \n\nAfter telling the server, she offered to rectify it with a free coffee... Which was slightly more flavorful than water... Then brought a $200 lunch bill to the table. \n\nWould never go back... Go to Prime at Bellagio or Capital Grill."

This best perfectly chopped Salad I've ever had. My entree was the Seared Ahi Steaks and were perfectly prepared Sushi grade Ahi Steaks on a sliced cucumber ocean salad. Amazing.\nWith a side of Brussels. I was in Heaven!"

Only problem, unless you know where you are going, its a little hard to find.  Look for the Burberry cuz its right across from Palm, since everyone we asked thought we were looking for the Palm hotel."

I'm a BIG bone-in Rib Eye fan... requested at Medium-Rare+... in parts the steak was, but overall it was not even rare, it was blue. The temperature was off too. Their hash-browns were good, but anything with that much butter is going to taste good. Compared to places like Osteria Mozza in LA, this Rib Eye was a \"C\" at best. A lot better places to spend your money in Vegas than what is now a typical chain restaurant."

And the food and service are what you'd expect when you pay their prices.\n\nI had the half-lobster (half of a 3-lb) and the salmon (which they even cooked rare for me.)  Both were stellar.  The portions are small, and everything is a la carte, but delicious.  Everyone at our table raved about the lobster (as did I), and my husband really liked the bone-in filet mignon.  They crack the lobster for you, at your table.  Everything was cooked just right, and nicely seasoned.    \n\nThere are photos on the walls of people who have frequented the restaurant enough to earn them.\n\nExpect to spend a lot of money here for dinner, and expect to enjoy every bite!"

I thought it was because I order it it to be medium well but someone else in our party go medium rare and even with a lot of pick in the middle the outside was burnt. She too has to add salt to try and make it taste better. \n\nThe lobsters were huge and I don't love lobster but it was actually really good. I would recommend the lobster. \n\nThe service is pretty good overall"

Just a short stop to Maine.\nFollow up with \"Clams Oreganata\". Small clams topped with just the right amount of garlic, bread crumbs and lemon served hot and crisp.     This could be Lago Bolsana. \nFinally a \"Monday Night\" chopped salad with anchovies. Tangy would be the word. Sort of reminds you of the 70's music and Donna Summers or Gloria Gainer. Topped off with a \"Duckhorn\" Sauvigon Blank and double espresso  with a hint of Galliano. \n\nGive me the good old days anytime."

            "review": "This was a disappointing experience for our group.  We selected this restaurant as it looked like the menu had many options as well as thought it would be a nice dining experience.  Our server was so frantic, rushed, seemed annoyed by our presence, and had absolutely no input or anything to say about the menu or things that we were debating between.  His assistance was the only real saving grace for the service (wish I knew her name).  She was friendly, actually took the time to take a photo of us (the server would have not done this I'm sure), brought us additional bread, etc.\n\nThe atmosphere itself was completely chaotic with the staff racing around the restaurant like crazy people.  The noise volume was off the charts which made it hard to have conversation without feeling like we were shouting across the table.  It was definitely not what we expected.\n\nThe food was ok.  My filet was cooked perfectly and was delicious as a stand alone as the sauce I selected (brandy peppercorn) was salty and just plain gross.  The asparagus was bland and flavorless, the goat-cheese mashed were good although not off the charts, the mushrooms were disgusting - they were sent back.  The chicken parmesan was pretty good although it was covered in sauce and the presentation was lacking in most of the dishes.\n\nIf you want something mediocre at best, than it would be fine but it is not a restaurant that I would recommend and definitely won't be back.  There are so many amazing places to eat in Vegas and I'm seriously sorry we wasted one of our dining experiences here."

We ordered a steak and lobster which came out almost perfect. The only downside was the salad we ordered came out chopped and tossed with dressing, creating almost like mashed baby food instead of salad. I prefer crisp fresh salads with dressing on the side. If the server would have explained the process I would have ordered something different. We had the lobster mac and cheese too which was very delicious and rivaled the steak and lobster for best thing on our table."

I had the lobster bisque - absolutely delish! Our sides were the half and half....half homemade potato chips & half thinest onion rings ever, cooked perfectly, plus our second side was mashed potatoes with goat cheese- I say wowsa! Terrific service too! What more can you ask for from a top Vegas restaurant!\nImportant note - you will most likely have leftovers - if you take a to go bag and are attending a concert at Caesar's, they will not allow you to take the food in. They check inside your purses too. It must be hidden in your coat, sock, bra whatever! Just wanted you to know so you don't get disappointed!"

A tasty red onion would have been absolutely perfect!.  The garlic potatoes, without saying, the best, along with the spinach.  When it came to the lobster,  did someone forget it was in the oven?  So stuck to the shell.  If you wanted to eat it, you had to pry it loose.  Our waiter did offer a dessert to compensate for the \"toughness\" of the lobster.  No thank you, but you could offer to buy me that $24.00 dollar \"glass\" of wine."

Wedge salad and a three pound lobster.  \n\nWe like to share so we can try different menu items. They split the salad and lobster on separate plates which made it easier.  \n\nThe crab was presented in a bed of radicchio lettuce with the sauce on the side.  This allowed us to control the amount of sauce we had on our crab.\n\nWe would recommend this for a nice Vegas experience."

Before I start, I would like to say the 2 busser's were working very hard\nand if it wasn't for them, the experience would be disastrous, I really hope they are promoted to waiters soon.\n\nWe all knew things were headed downhill when we asked the waiter what our side options were for our 4 & 6 lb. lobster plate and he said, \"It's in the menu.\" \nTo give that type of response to a patron is not acceptable anywhere, not even McDonalds or Taco Bell. We should have immediately gone up and left but we \ngave them the benefit of doubt, which was a big mistake. It took forever to get our bread, to which the busser overheard us and went and immediately got us \nbread. Our waiter lied to us and said one of their busser's went on strike which is why service was slow, really?? We spoke with the manager, and while he was\napologetic, they didn't really do anything else to make our experience more pleasurable. We asked to switch our waiter, the new waitress was a lot better but\nby this time the damage had been done. The lobster bisque was great, and we asked that they de-shell the lobsters for us, but by the time the food arrived\nthe lobster was not good at all. It was very chewy and not appealing at all. We had ordered a surf & turf, the filet was just as bad.\n\nWe had a pretty big bill for our party of 4: I have no issue paying a premium for premium quality food, but from what I experienced, Red Lobster would have\nbeen a better choice for us. To make things worst, they did not really compensate us for the poor service and attitude the waiter gave us. I am not expecting \na free meal, but a well know and reputable establishment needs to do a better job to serve their patrons. Actually, they did give us a free gimlet, but at that point it was too little too late."

            "review": "Ruben and I joined another fun couple to take advantage of the Restaurant Week menu tonight. We sat inside and ordered drinks to start. I had the PALM REFRESH (vodka, muddled basil, etc) and it was tasty and refreshing (haha)! \n\nAfter looking at the menus, we asked our server for the Restaurant Week menu. He not only proceeded to look at me like I was crazy, but actually said, \"What are you talking about??? What is that? What are you saying?\" Not sure why he got so upset. So, instead of continuing this frustrating discussion, I started to bring the page up on my phone. Our friend, Diana, ended up asking the young lady that brought our water and fortunately, she knew exactly what we were talking about and graciously brought us menus. No apologies from our server. He seemed really confused about a lot of things and was also argumentative, absentminded, and not entirely friendly. We tried joking with him to lighten the mood or to show that we had forgiven his prior offenses, but it didn't do much.\n\nWe all did the RW prie fixe and an order of CALAMARI FRITTI. The portion was extremely generous! The calamari was not fresh and completely lacked in flavor though. I think it was served with marinara and it was not good. For the first course, Ruben got the LOBSTER BISQUE and it was all right, just unfortunately salty. I chose the ROASTED BEET AND GOAT CHEESE SALAD; the beets were nice and overall, the salad was good, however, the goat cheese was just okay and the arugula was weighed down by the amount of dressing.\n\nI ordered the FILET MIGNON, single cut served with Goat Cheese Whipped Potatoes and Wild Mushroom & Black Truffle Demi as my second course. The filet was dry and not flavorful; I also ordered medium rare and it obviously wasn't. The whipped potatoes were really delicious and the Demi was good. Ruben had the CHICKEN PARMIGIANA; the Linguine Marinara was good - cooked perfectly al dente, simple sauce, and fresh basil, however, the chicken was disappointing.\n\nFor dessert, everyone chose the NEW YORK STYLE CHEESECAKE and I chose the KEY LIME PIE. They were both really great! The cheesecake was light, crumbly, not too dense, the crust was wonderful, and I loved the compote with it. Perfect. The key lime pie wasn't overly tart, same wonderful crust, great flavor. Nice berry compote too.\n\nThe good: generous portions, dessert. The bad: service, food quality and overall taste. I'd rather pay more money for better food, so the plate sizes are a petty matter and comparatively, there are much better Italian restaurants (Ferraro's!) and Steakhouses in town. Also, let your servers know when you're participating in a week-long event as to avoid an awkward situation with your patrons!"

I've been to the Palm in Tyson's Corner VA, which is equally nice, but it was a work event in a private room so it was hard to judge.  So when we realized we didn't have reservations, but the Palm in Vegas could take us for dinner, I jumped at the chance.  It was pricey, but very worth the money.  I had a gut-busting 26 ounch slice of heavenly prime rib - and it was cooked perfectly.  The potatos au gratin were okay, but I like the ones at Ruths Chris better.  We were so full we didn't have dessert, which is too bad, because I've heard they're great here.  Overall a great, traditional restaurant.  If you're looking for fusion-this, nouveau-that food go elsewhere, but if you want an awesome steak (or salmon, which my wife had) this is the place to go."

Should have sent it back because it was medium well to done but F**K it I was hungry and it was on someone else's dime and didn't want to stir things up.

While the food was very good (I had the crab cakes, everyone else had steak - but everyone said the steak was quality), there was a vital service error that I thought was handled the wrong way.\n\nLet me first clearly state that my crab cakes were damn good, and so were the sides of green beans with pancetta and mashed potatoes.  The food was 4-stars-good, albeit overpriced.\n\nOur waiter was a good guy and he did a good job overall, BUT... one guy's steak was either really overcooked or they just plain forgot it...I really can't remember which happened, but that is irrelevant.  Anyway, they told him they would get him a new one in just a few minutes.  They then came out and shot him straight saying that cooking a new steak at this point would take more than a few minutes.  They asked if he wanted something else that might cook a little faster, and the Victim stated he would take some crab cakes.\n\nHere is where they went wrong.  They gave him a free drink for his troubles.  I don't know if this waiter had any control over this situation, but to me... with a group of 13 people at a special occasion like this, you should be getting that entree for free.  He didn't want crab cakes, he wanted steak... and they screwed up and there was no way for him to be eating his entree even close to the same time as the other 12 people at that table.  If you're at the level of pricing that a restaurant like this is ($36 for crab cakes, even more for the steak), there's a certain raised level of expectations for service - and they just weren't met here.  The bill for this meal was probably in the $1500-2000 range... they should've taken the $50 hit to make it right and give this guy his steak for free.  Maybe that just isn't done at places like this... I can't say I go to them regularly enough to gauge something like that.\n\nNo other complaints, the waiter was good overall... I just think The Great Steak Incident Of 2014 was handled all wrong.  I wouldn't eat there again, but that's because I wouldn't regularly pay $36 for crab cakes when I can go to In N Out burger for 8 bucks.  I'm a classy gentleman."

I celebrated my 21st birthday with my family (2 aunts and uncles, cousin, parents, boyfriend- party of 9) at the Palms restaurant. Let me first start by saying, this is the BEST restaurant in caesars palace by far. They have truly earned their 5 stars from me. \n\nMy birthday dinner was on a Friday night- but we couldn't help ourselves, we also stopped by Thursday night for some cocktails. My mom got a glass of sauvignon blanc- really good. My cousin got an espresso martini which was fantastic.On top of the martini, she ordered a shot of espresso as well. Now, she is a professional espresso drinker (if there is such a thing) and this espresso was impeccably delicious. You could tell that it was good espresso because the raw sugar stayed at the top then drizzled down in the cup. They served it with a lemon wedge and raw sugar on a stick (kind of looked like rock candy) and it was fantastic! The rest of my family got dirty martinis with blue cheese filled olives TO DIE FOR!! The best martini I have ever had. The measurements were all accurate (olive juice to vodka). \n\nOn Friday, it was the night of my birthday dinner. We were greeted wit such a delight-able and friendly staff. The staff went out of their way to make my birthday dinner as special as it could possibly be. They blocked off an entire room for my dinner with my family. The table was decked out in birthday decorations such as stars and confetti etc. \nThe appetizers: fried calamari (10/10) you could taste the octopus and the seasoning was delicious.  \ncarpaccio of beef tenderloin-AMAZING and the only thing on the appetizer list that is not seafood and well worth trying. Take it from me!\nBacon wrapped scallops: FRESH bacon wrapped in hot moist scallops. Perfect amount of saltiness.\nBaked clams casino: the BEST food on the menu. The clams were baked into the shell with seasoning. SOOOOOOOO GOOD I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. \n\nThe ceaser salad had fresh Parmesan cheese on top with crisp romaine lettuce. I got the salad with sardines which completed the meal. The sardines were so fresh and salty.\n\nA few of us got the lobster, which was cooked to perfection. The rest got steaks. This restaurant is a steak house, so you can't go wrong with ordering one. They are known for their steaks. \n\nThey surprised me with chocolate cake and sang to me. It was a great experience. The chocolate cake was by far the best cake I ever had. The general manager came in the room afterwards and showed true professionalism by buying us all a round of espresso martini shots. He introduced himself to us and got familiar with my family. GREAT guy. Outstanding experience here at the Palm. They truly earned each 5 stars. Great job!!"

The steak was great but I'm not sure what the advantage of the \"bone-in\" feature was. The lobster was good and the attendant who took it apart for me did a great job. I'd never been to a place that provides that service. Made the bib kinda pointless.\nMy wife had the tuna which was good but the layer of peppercorns over the top was a little overwhelming.\nWe also had the calamari appetizer, which was big enough for 4 people.\n\nI tried a signature drink called the \"Seasonal Mule\" (Grey Goose Vodka, ginger beer, hand-squeezed lemon and lime juice, Angostura Bitters, served on the rocks.) DO NOT get this drink, it tastes like how a urinal cake in a public bathroom smells. Luckily the waitress took it off the bill and gave me a vodka/tonic instead.\n\nOur waitress was overbearing. Friendly, but barely gave us a chance to breathe with renovation stories and opportunities to join the rewards club and blah blah blah with too many visits to the table. I could've used a bit more space to enjoy the date with my wife.\n\nOther than that, it was great."

That said, I did enjoy my meal here.\n\nI started out with the caesar salad. It was a good one. The croutons were nice and crispy though probably of the packaged variety. The romaine was green and crisp and the dressing was tangy and tasty. A nice salad overall.\n\nFor my entree I chose the surf and turf special which was $54. I dont order much lobster but it seemed like a good deal since it included the salad and a side in the price. The lobster tail was supposedly 6 ounces and the entire lobster tail, including shell may have touched six ounces before being cooked but I doubt it. There was about two ounces of meat, tops. But it was two ounces of VERY PERFECTLY cooked lobster. The tails so often end up chewy but this was anything but. Maybe the best lobster tail I have ever had.\n\nThe filet was supposedly seven ounces and I'd say it probably was but it did seem small. For a steak house it wasnt looking like much. This was a simply grilled filet, not broiled, and it lacked the thick char I expect from a steakhouse. The meat was of good quality and again cooked to an absolutely perfect medium rare but it was the least favorite part of my meal. It was underseasoned and just average in every way except for the temperature of the meat.\n\nMy side was the three cheese gratin potatoes and it did not disappoint. Straight up delicious and there was actually plenty of it this time. \n\nOverall, for lobster, steak, salad and side at $54 it seemed like a pretty fair deal. \n\nThe service was ok, nothing special. Our waitress seemed a little intimidated, almost like it was her first day or something.\n\nI would go again but would pick other steakhouses if it was up to me. If this is a special meal and you dont eat at restaurants of this caliber frequently, your money could be better spent elsewhere.\n\nStill four stars since I really cant find anything to complain about and some stuff was excellent but I wish I could give three and a half because only the lobster was anything much above ordinary."

The ambiance was very nice, but our waiter, an older gentlemen I was expecting to be a pro, first let my husband and I down by only telling us of their summer lobster special was that it would save us $50. We love lobster, but decided against it thinking it would be a whole lobster we would have to break apart ourselves (let's just say the last place I ordered a whole lobster turned into an extremely messy and unpleasant affair). However, as we waited for a very long time for our beverages to arrive, we watched waiters bringing food to nearby tables and saw the lobster special. It was already split and the waiter even broke apart the rest of the lobster for you and took away the shells upon service of your food. We were a little mad our waiter did not tell us this, it would have been a selling point for us. Anyway, as a starter I ordered a Garden Salad with the Garlic Vinaigrette on the side, which was really pure oil, not even good tasting extra virgin olive oil.... It made me upset to my stomach. As an entree, I had the broiled crab cakes, which were okay. My husband had a steak, he also thought was okay, but after having a steak at the Mesa Grill the previous night he thought his steak at Palm did not compare. Overall, this was not a good experience especially, for the cost of the meal."

I always appreciate it when restaurant honors the reservation. We sat on the patio area which is excellent the people watching. We ordered the wedge salad to start. It's not officially part of the special but they were happy to give it to us. This has to be the best wedge I've ever had. It was huge and difficult to finish because of it's size. We ordered the lobster steamed. It came out cooked to perfection. They split the lobster for you at the table pulling the meat out of the shell. We were two couples so we ended up getting two sides. We ordered mushrooms and the creamed spinach. The sides were each excellent. Because it was our friends anniversary, they brought a huge piece of cheesecake for us to share. With four of us working on it, at the end of this meal, we could not finish the cake. My only gripe and the thing that stopped us from getting 5 stars was our waiter, Coyote, who appeared promptly when we sat down, disappeared for the rest of the night. There was a second waiter who was apparently in training he also disappeared for the entire night. The service for the evening was salvaged by an absolutely outstanding busboy who provided the service normally provided by the waiter. Unfortunately I did not get his name. If he had been our main server: this would have been a five star meal."

Both of our waiters, using cloth napkins, broken open the claws of our lobster and pulled the meat out for us.

There always seems to be some sort of special going on. The previous month was a fantastic deal of their awesome 12oz prime beef burger, with toppings, for about $8! The month we went it was $80 for a 4lb lobster, split for two, with two sides and two starters, and a happy hour with sliders for a crazy low price. this time we went just for steaks and dropped almost $400 total on a steak dinner for two with a nice bottle of wine, starters, sides, desserts; huge portions, everything cooked perfectly.\n\nWhenever you go you can expect great service, an incredible atmosphere (inside clubby steakhouse, outside people watching sidewalk cafe), and great food. No pomp here, this isn't a jacket and tie place (unless you want it to be). We've done Ramsay Steak, Delmonico's, and a few other fancy joints, but this is the one where I feel comfortable, and where I feel I am getting a fair deal and nobody is trying to rip me off (for example they just bring you nice cold tap water, no trying to upsell you bottled unless you ask for it)."

The dinner started well and we ordered cocktails with both of us deciding on an appitizer, filets cooked medium rare and some sides. When the food arrived everything looked great and my filet was perfect. My firend's filet was overcooked to more of a medium well. Disappointed for her, I suggested we tell the server and send it back but she insisted didnt want to ruin dinner. I suggested a few more times but I also noticed the server did not check on us through dinner. My friend mentioned she will just give feedback since they should know at least know there was a problem. Well after we were finished, the server finally came to the table to ask if we wanted desert. I had let Palm know of the occasion in advance and at this point my friend proceeded to politely let her know that her steak had been overcooked and a bit dry. The server asked if she wanted another steak and of course the answer was no as my friend did eat most of the filet and clarified that she just wanted to let her know. I was hoping at this point that the birthday desert done at Palm would salvage the experience. The server left the desert menu with us but shortly returned with the check stating that since there was a problem with the filet, they removed the charge in lieu of her birthday desert. ???? First of all my friend didn't even know about the desert since she had not been there before. Second, we didnt ask for anything to be done and they should have asked if that was what we wanted. We didnt even elude to a credit request. Essentially, feedback was provided and the message to us as customers was to leave. \n\nHow horribly rude of Palm and also very embarrassing for me since I recommended the establishment. \n\nBeing locals to Vegas and having plenty of favorite spots and first class service restaraunts in the area, we will not be back. We will be sure to steer recommendations of friends, travelers, business associates and family elsewhere. \n\nShame on Palm for clearly showing that your customers do not matter."

Not a lot of lobster, but all of us really liked it and the spoon was wonderful to eat with. From there it only went downhill.\n\nI don't know where to start. Maybe with the least bad, the wine.\nThe red wine of the house had a dusty aftertaste and my friends recommended wine was really sour.\n\nFor the entree I had the filet mignon and my friends the 20oz porterhouse steak.\nIt looked great on the menu and there was massive advertisement about this place in the galleria. I ordered mine medium-rare because I like it, but the waiter quickly corrected me with a simple \"medium\" and wrote it on his paper. End of discussion.\n\nTo this we ordered the three cheese potato au gratin since we wanted some more than just a piece of meat. We shouldn't. I love potato gratin but this one would start a new revolution if it was served in France. Too much cheese and no texture at all. Felt like creamy lumps. The filet mignon came and I would have prefered it medium-rare, which I told him. That wasn't the biggest problem though. It didn't taste anything at all. The texture was nice but I didn't taste any of the seasoning - at all! And it wasn't served with a sauce or anything. The porterhouse was a big piece of meat, but it felt like we got the left over pieces. The aioli was a bit too sour, but still one of the best things. The meat tasted too much rosemary and my friends got bored of it and I understand why by the little I tried.\n\nBy now we were really disappointed and hoped for the dessert. Which was a disaster that all three of us leaved half way through. It was a big piece of microwaved brownie with a watery vanilla sauce and some sad jam. I don't even want to review it.\n\nThe worste part pf the whole experience wasn't the food though. The fact that it is Las Vegas and that the place is located in a galleria, fine, but we didn't feel any genuine service at all. It's not often you hear that you got the food too quick, but that's what happened here. It seemed like all the food was pre-made and only waited to be thrown out at the table so that we could pay and they could have new guests to rob. They won - we lost. $250 bucks in the ocean."

It took another 10 minutes for her to make it back to take our order, and then 10 more to get the bread basket!   Ridiculous.\n\nThe food was good - I had a jumbo lump crab cocktail that was full of crab and well worth the price, while others in the group had sandwiches and steak burgers with fries.  My husband said his blue cheese steak burger was delicious, and another guest said that the chicken sandwich from the specialty menu was really tasty.  \n\nOverall we would try this restaurant again on another visit to Vegas, but definitely would NOT sit with the inattentive server again.

Dinner was served by a very energetic waiter...and his son.  Very pleasant, close to annoying.  Service was consistent and outstanding throughout the evening.  Main courses for steak were tasty, but way over priced.  Avoid the veal, it was dreadful, worse I ever had.  Dry, pounded gray substance of some sort.  I guess it was meant to be that way.

This felt like eating at a food court to me, so I was in kind of a strange mood, but I decided to be open minded.  Two dirty martinis helped me lighten up a good bit, so once the food started coming around I was a very happy fellow.  I ordered a Monday Night Salad, which, for what I paid for it should have been better; it was average at best.  When the meal finally came out, I was basically in glutton heaven.  We ordered (for a table of 4), a 6 lb. lobster and a bone-in rib-eye with three sides (three-cheese potatoes, creamed spinach, and brussel sprouts served with lobster in a madeira wine sauce).  The lobster was phenomenal and they left the roe in the body cavity so that made it that much more decadent!  The steak was good, but came out a bit cooler than I had hoped for.  The sides, well, you read the description earlier; they were flavorful and heavy and terrible for me, but delicious.  After that meal I needed a nap, but we sat and I finished my big glass of wine while my crazy father ordered dessert!  The food here is nothing revolutionary, but it comes in big portions and is very tasty.  Maybe not worth the bill at the end, but I had a nice time, so put a price-tag on that!"

Everytime I walk through the Caesars Forum Shops, I always glance over and then look away, not wanting to tempt myself but always saying, \"I want to try that place.\"  Tonight, I did.\n\nThe restaurant had a sign out front advertising some sort of happy hour menu, so I went inside to investigate.  They call it \"Prime Time,\" and it's a menu of 7 items normally priced around $10-$12, but from 5pm-7pm and 9pm-close those items are only $3.50!\n\nI tried the filet mignon capri sandwiches per the bartender's recommendation, and they were delicious.  Three slider-style sandwiches on a bed of homemade potato chips.  The waitress also sold me on getting a couple of $2 shrimp cocktail, which were monstrous and I would say the best I have ever had.\n\nOther items on the cheap-o menu include kobe beef sliders, \"ultimate\" chicken strips, mini broiled crab cakes, veal parmigiana sliders, \"Point Judith\" calamari fritti, and prime cheese steak.  They also have oysters on the half shell for $1 apiece.  Unfortunately, my appetite would not allow me to continue eating, but I promised the bartender that I'd be back.\n\nSpeaking of which, the service was fantastic.  The bartender's name was Jax, and she made up for the last few days of poor service I've been getting elsewhere.\n\nI also signed up for their membership card -- it costs $25, and you get points for money spent at their restaurants.  When you sign up, they give you a $25 gift card, so it's essentially free, as long as you plan to come back a second time, which I definitely will.  The card apparently also gets you some sort of food specials, depending on when you come in.\n\nI peeked at the full menu before leaving and all I remember seeing is the lobster for 2 special that's listed at the top of the Twitter page.  I thought it was a few dollars cheaper, but $90 for a 4 pound lobster, 2 salads, and a side.  When Restaurant Week is over, I'll be trying this one.

Maybe its the price of beef but the 14 oz Filet Oscar now rang in at $56, up $5. Lobster Bisque was $15. I didn't look at the bill so I didn't notice the cocktail prices.\nI dropped the place a star because of a few things. One the bread basket is not as good as before, and missing a sweet nutty bread that was always one of my favorites. Two the cocktails were just a little too weak this time. Three the filet itself lacked a little flavor, but the hollandaise sauce was very good.\nThe lobster bisque is still one of my favorites in town. \n\nI go here when my friends go here.

For $50 you get appetizer, entree and desert.  Such a deal!\nIf you are ordering a meal like we did, with lots of lobster, be careful not to order too many appetizers or sides.  My husband and I split the Palm salad, which was a very generous portion even halved! We also ordered the pancetta green beans, creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes for 4 of us. Way too much.  One side would have been plenty. And the bread basket is to die for, especially the brown bread.  Try, really try hard not to overdose on that stuff before dinner.  It is amazing.\n\nLOBSTER.

It is located within Caesar's Palace after all. We are seated into a booth that was a little to squished, yet weirdly comfortable.

It had a nice old-school steakhouse feel with dimmed lights and deep mahogany, but also had some cartoon caricatures on the wall for fun. \n\nAs for the food, I was semi-impressed.  First off, the drinks looked impressive, but overall were just expensive.  It was $3 for a little glass bottle of Coca-cola! Cute.....but pricey.  My brother ordered the Chicken Parmesean (which was HUGE....like the size of my head!) with a side of Spaghetti Marinara.  The chicken and pasta were pretty good! Unfortunately, since I had a much smaller appetite, I decided to order two appetizers instead of a full meal.  Big mistake! While the portions were outrageously large, the food I ordered was just mediocre.  I had a Caprese Salad (which featured 3 HUGE super thick slices of bland flavorless tomatoes topped with big gobs of also flavorless mozerella cheese and no basil in sight) and the Calamari (nicely battered, but a little over-seasoned)."

Came here for my 50th birthday for lobster and came back last week for my Buddies birthday. Both times ordering the Lobster. Took my son here for his 16th birthday for Lobster (although I had a steak). \nSteaks here are excellent but the Nova\nScotia Lobster is out of this world."

My Cobb salad that he recommended was one of the best ever once he suggested their house blue cheese dressing. The dressing that was on it originally lacked a bit in flavor. My other half had the soup, and it was a bit salty. Ruan could tell he wasn't crazy about it and brought him another without us even asking! The other soup was also a bit salty. Delicious bread brought to our table. 2 on the soups, 4 on the salads. Would come back again!"

Instead of asking, \"what would you like to order this evening, Miss?\" to my mother-in-law, he brazenly gruffed, \"...whatta ya eatin'?\" I loved it. Instead of \"offering\" dessert at the end, he exclaimed, \"I'm bringin' ya dessert...you're gonna love it. It's just a matter of whether you eat it here or at home.\" Definitely a welcome change to the sometimes mundane \"proper\" service one usually finds at a fine steakhouse.\n\nSpeaking of steaks...holy crap. I ordered the dry-aged prime, bone-in ribeye and it was one of, if not THE best steaks I've ever had. Perfectly cooked medium-rare with a nice crusty char on the outside that really gave a beautiful, bacony like crunch to the outside layer of fat. The sides, creamy spinach and potato gratin, were just as delicious. We also received a nice chilled seafood platter at the beginning of the meal that Lopez graciously put together for us. Perfect starter to such a feast. \n\nLastly, I have to give a shout out to our busser, Rafael. What a workhorse! After the several messes we made during each course, he somehow was able to manage clearing us and making our table look like we just sat down. Most impressive. \n\nIf you feel like having an amazing steak with no upturned noses and lots of charm and attitude, this is your place. Simply fantastic."

Flemings had a similar deal to this... it's essentially $50 bucks for appetizer, entree, and desert.  (Keep in mind this isn't a dinky entree, you get 2 items)\n\nI chose the Caesar salad, filet and lobster, and pumpkin creme brulee.  The great Honey Boo Boo Child once said in an interview, \"my special juice is gonna make me winnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\" and she proceeded to shake her head and her belly.  She felt a sense of excitement and power as she said this, and the reason I mention that is because I felt that same way as I was eating this meal at Palm.  It was wonderful and made me feel as Honey Boo Boo Child did that day.  I just wanted to dance in place and shake my head and stomach from happiness.\n\nMoving forward, you can upgrade the lobster to a bigger size.  They crack it for you at the table.  Wasn't over done at all.  The filet is cooked perfectly to order.  The Caesar was phenomenal.  I like Caesars where the lettuce is almost to the point that it's soggy, but not quite, and that's how this one is. I know sounds weird, but it's great.  By the time desert came, I couldn't eat.  It was definitely a kings feast, everything came out on one big platter.  They even squeeze lemon on your hands when you're done, what else can you ask for??\n\nSitting outside gives you the mall forum shops vibe, but sitting inside takes you away, you feel you are at a private restaurant.  Our server Megan is so nice and accommodating.  Great experience."

(Silently pouts)\n\nTrying not to be a typical LA food snob, but it's hard not to when you're dropping serious money and expecting at least a 9 out of 10 foodie experience but instead you're getting a 3.\n\nWe get to the palms at 7 pm and check out their menu outside their restaurant.\u00a0 We walk into a mostly empty restaurant and we're escorted to a booth in the back. Along the way, I notice a lot of celebrity caricatures lined the walls and above their bar which suggests to me that a lot of celebrities come here to eat. So I think we should be in for a treat.\n\nFor the appetizer we ordered fried calamaris.\u00a0 And for our main entree, I ordered a 14 oz medium rare filet mignon with creamed spinach.\u00a0 My wife ordered a sauteed Chilean sea bass.\n\nFirst, the assortment of cold bread comes out. I know I don't go there for the bread but not having warm bread on the table as the first thing is a little off putting. The least the Palms can do is pretend it's fresh by nuking it in the microwave.\n\nOur fried calamaris came out on a huge plate and could have easily fed at least four or five people. We were hungry so we dove in. The calamaris itself was properly fried and not too oily and the tomato sauce had a good tartness to it. However, after a few pieces we kept finding fried bell peppers mixed in with the calamaris. Since the bell peppers were thinly cut, breaded, and fried they looked like a tentacle. Maybe the chef didn't feel the need to use a clean mixing bowl when breading the calamaris but that resulted in bell pepper booby traps laced across the dish.\n\nMy filet mignon and creamed spinach arrive and the caveman in me was craving for some bloody meat. The thick filet mignon was seared nicely but when I took a bite, the texture wasn't very tender and tougher than expected for dry aged beef. Additionally, the meat was completely void of any flavor which calls into question their minimum 35 dry aging process. I was expecting stronger beefy flavor notes from the ageing but all I tasted was the age.\n\nThe creamed spinach was okay but I was so supremely disappointed with the meat that I lacked the appetite to finish the sad slab of meat.\n\nAs for the chillian sea bass, it was easily the largest cut I've seen at a restaurant. The added benefit of chillian sea bass is that you don't need to do much and this fish should still stands on its own.\n\nHowever, when my wife took a bite, the sad puppy dog eyes on her face said it all. The sea bass was perfectly cooked but the only flavor this had was from the mild salt of the waters it was caught from. It's true that you don't need to do much for this fish, but you can't just pull it out of the sea and add zero seasoning to it either. However we are partly to blame for this disaster because we broke the sacred rule to never order seafood at a steakhouse. \n\nOur server noticed our dissatisfaction and did refund the creamed spinach and calamaris. But at the end of the day, I still dropped more than $100 on an uninspired dinner that still left me hungry/hangry when we left. \n\nClearly this place attempts to pass itself off as a legit steakhouse but like it's characatures on its walls, what they feature was greatly exaggerated."

I plan to go back and try out one of their steak dinners though too.  \nMy final comments on this restaurant: GO!!!!"

I love that they are so happy to split everything for those that are sharing.  I do believe that they have THE BEST caesar salad in Las Vegas, oh my!!  The lobster bisque is an incredible way to start your meal and you will probably want to lick the bowl.  Fantastic selection of wines.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the lack of fantastic side dishes.  I always expect them to be amazing but the description always makes them sound better than they are.  Skip the side dish and have the caesar salad, lobster bisque and lobster!! That's where it's at."

He dropped a steak knife on my foot and did not bother to apologize, even though the knife clearly hit me. The hearts of palm salad (which, for some reason, is not listed on the menu) is really delicious. The wedge salad is a clusterf*ck that somehow includes walnuts and a ton of fried onions.  My boyfriend and I each ordered a filet. His came out perfect, while mine came out covered in a layer of grease that I was actually able to pour off the top onto my plate. We ordered the brussel sprouts and the half fries, half onion strings as sides and both were mediocre. My boyfriend likes this place, so it's likely I'll be back, but rest assured, there will be some kicking and screaming along the way from my end to get there."

Having looked at the menu online as well as reviews on Yelp I knew this place would be outside of my price range for food. I ate lunch before I came and I am happy I did. While I did not order food I did order some drinks. One iced tea and one Irish Coffee. When my check came I was shocked to see the iced tea was $4.25 and the coffee was another $12+. With tip I ended up paying $20 for two drinks. Oh my word! That being said, the tea, while small, was a good fresh tasting iced tea. The Irish Coffee, also small, had enough alcohol to feel the burn. And the whipped cream, real whipped cream, what incredibly rich and very thick. Almost too thick to be whipped cream. It was almost as whipped butter. Delicious. I wish the coffee was a tad hotter but other than that, not bad. The service was good too. There were a lot of us in attendance this afternoon and the restaurant seemed to be busy. Still, three or four servers kept our needs in mind and tended to us frequently and almost without being seen. I didn't even see my check arrive.  Aside from the service and the drinks that I did get to experience, the food I saw and could smell seemed great. I was getting hungry. Maybe for a very, emphasize VERY special occassion, I'll try the food too."

In the year and a half since, we've been back to this location several times as well at the downtown Los Angeles and San Diego location. However, the Vegas location is the best in my opinion, mainly because of the service.Palm has become one of our favorite go-to restaurants. \nDon't expect a hip and modern vibe here- Palm is classic old school and perhaps that's what makes it good. Classic food such as filet and lobster- you can't wrong with that. But the the way the food is cooked here and the freshness of the ingredients is what really makes it stand out. Although I've tried a few other things on the menu, the filet mignon is to die for. Its cooked perfectly, a little bit crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside. The Gigi salad is worth trying as well but beware-its quite large and could be a meal in itself. Once again its a simple salad but everything is so fresh, you'll swear they have their own vegetable outside.  \nIf you've never eaten here before, make sure you let them know. On our first visit, we were given a slice of cheesecake on the house. I'm not a cheesecake fan ordinarily but that's a damn good cheesecake. Apparently, its not made fresh there but shipped from New Jersey but I think that's what makes it so good, ha! \nThe Vegas location is one of the few open for lunch so be sure to take advantage of the business lunch. Its around $20 and is a great way to try out the food at Palm without breaking the bank. \nOne last note, join the 837 club, you will receive great coupons that make it worth your while such as free entrees. When a filet is $45, its a great deal."

However, the food wasn't up to par for me.\n\nWhat I really wanted was the Prime Rib, but they didn't have any more left.  So, I settled for the Rib Eye.  I ordered it medium-rare as per the chef's recommendation, but it was unevenly cooked and most of It came out more on the rare side.  It was also one of the fattiest pieces of steak that I've ever had.\n\nI also had the Lobster Bisque, which I thought was a bit too rich/smokey and have had better, but everyone else who had it loved it.  The jumbo shrimp cocktail was satisfactory.\n\nThat seemed to be the trend at our table.  Most of those who had lobster or some other type of seafood enjoyed their meals, while those of us who had steak were left unsatisfied."

We ended up sitting \"outside\" in the Caesar's promenade area because there was a larger party just breaking up inside.  Only four other tables on the patio.  There was just an overall lack of energy, lack of enthusiasm, lack of attentiveness, which is quite unusual for a Palm.  Maybe after a long Holiday weekend everyone's energy level was a bit down.\n\nWe went with the Businessman's Lunch special -- my usual go-to meal option.  The Lobster Bisque was beyond salty.  I mentioned it to the server, and she offered to replace it.  I didn't want to bother at that point, so I kind of blew it off (not knowing what was to come).  Had I known, I would have send it back & requested a salad.  Ended up drinking 3 - 4 glasses of water to compensate for the LV parched air and the saltiness in the bisque.\n\nSecond course:  NY Strip steak -- both of us ordered med-rare.  Mine was cooked properly (it was a tad thicker than my hubby's) in the middle (edges were overdone), but no flavor and had a mealy consistency.  Hubby sent his back once, and should have sent it back a second time.  Poorly cooked, poorly seasoned, unimpressive steaks.  We each ate less than half of our steaks after picking through them & trying to find more tender tasty bits.  Definitely the worst steaks I've ever had a high-end steak house -- maybe the leftovers on the holiday Monday?\n\nServer ended up talking (and talking and talking . . . ) to the table next to us about a common interest while we were sitting there with obviously \"finished\" plates, and we waited for our plates to be cleared . . . .and waited to order our desserts (\"to go\" because we were fed up)  . . . . and waited for our check  . . . . and waited for its return.  FWIW - the key lime pie was nice, but the cheesecake was spot-on as usual!  We took them with us back to the Bellagio & ate them in the Sports Book while watching day baseball.  That was the best part of the meal, even though we had to bum silverware from the bar in the Sports Book because our server hadn't put any silver, napkins or the usual \"to go\" packets.\n\nOverall, not an overwhelming experience."

The steak oscar which I think was a special and included a steak and lobster was awesome from what I hear. Bites were shared and all agreed it was delicious. The sides were good, nothing really stood out. What did stand out were the desserts. The carrot cake was off the charts from what I'm told. I didn't try that one because I had my hands full with the chocolate cake. This thing looked like rich top soil, it was so dark. The serving size was HUGE. The table of some 12 ordered one carrot cake and one chocolate cake to share and we couldn't finish either even though they were spectacular. I think I could have mustered up the courage to finish the chocolate cake but I didn't want to go into a food coma.

The menu is not huge which is fine so you figure the few things they do have would be great. I ordered a filet mignon cooked medium. When I got the steak it was very well done with no sight of pink left. I called the waiter who then said hold on and grabbed the manager to come and look at it. I'm sorry do we really need the manager to come to my table to approve that yes my steak is way over cooked? So they brought me a new steak a few minutes later and the manager set it down and said I will wait while you cut into it to see that it is to your liking. A little awkward but okay. Plus that shows a lot of confidence in your cooks. So I cut it open and it was barely less cooked than before. By this time I was done wait sent the manager away so I could eat without being watched over. \n\nSo for $150 bucks (without tip) for 2 people I was far less than impressed with food or creativity of bartender.

By the way, Adrianna is phenomenal!  She knows the menu, and as a former wine director, knows her wine! She helped me choose delicious appetizers and affordable wines to have on the table when my guests arrived! Her suggestions were phenomenal!!  The wine and apps were amazing!  We had oysters orenganata, clams casino, scallops wrapped in bacon, and the fried calamari. All were spectacular!! The clams were phenomenal! The calamari was so good, not bready at all, just a light coating that was delicious! BTW...the marinara that accompanies the calamari is soo good!  We asked for an extra serving:)!     Our wine was 5 star!  We started with Prosecco to make a birthday toast.  I loved what Adrianna suggested! Our red wine was Dona Paula Malbec, and our white was Winter Hill Sauvignon Blanc.  Both were excellent and paired perfectly with our food!\nBefore I go on, I need to recognize our server Elaina!! She was THE BEST!!  She has been with the Palm Restaurant for 14 years and knows exactly how to run a perfect party!  She knew what time to bring each app, salad, entree, and dessert!  She also timed drinks perfectly with the food!  She is definitely  the server to ask for!!  The dinner was beyond exceptional! My daughter and I split the 6 pound lobster! It was phenomenal!  The lobster was from Nova Scotia and was excellent! Very tender and so sweet!!  The men ordered steaks which they are still raving about!! We ordered all of the sides, creamed spinach, wild mushrooms, mashed potatoes with cheese, and brussels sprouts.  I spoke to my niece earlier and she was still raving about the sides! They were just that good!!  When it came time for dessert our wonderful waitress Elaina, brought out an enormous piece of chocolate layer cake with a candle on it for my daughter! We all sang happy birthday and willingly helped the birthday girl eat the delicious cake!  The attentive and professional manager, Lawrence  Close continually monitored our party making sure we were raving fans - which we were!!\nI can't say enough good things about my experience at the Palms Restaurant!!! The food and drinks were amazing!  The customer service from the manager and staff were the best I have experienced!  I compare them with my visits to Peter Lugers, Capitol Grille, Smith and Wollenskys!  The Palm Restaurant was superior in every way!!    It was wonderful  seeing the smile on my daughters face!!! Knowing that every person in our party was a raving fan of the Palm Restaurant tells us that this restaurant truly earned all 5 stars!!  Thank you again Lawrence Close!!!"

When you go to a chain steakhouse, I think this is something what people should expect. It is well done for a chain steakhouse. I left the restaurant surprisingly more than satisfied.\n\nStaffs here are wonderful! Also they have great summer deals such as $99 lobster for two with a starter and a side. I am not a big fan of lobster so it is not for me but I think the deal is great! My husband had a small lobster tail and it was very good! He enjoyed it very much. \n\nMy Chilean sea bass was just okay. It's not bad but nothing special. Crab cake was very good! I wish I had that as a main course.

It's $26 and you get a soup or salad, choice of entree and side, and lastly choice of dessert. \nWe both ordered the soup which was Manhattan Clam Chowder.  Very good flavor. \nMy husband got the filet medallions with mixed veggies and he said the meat was tender and had great flavor.  The veggies were a mix of celery, Brussels sprouts, carrots, and green beans. The veggies were cooked just a little bit, they were not overcooked like a lot of places.\nI ordered the fish of the day which was halibut in a mustard and caper sauce. Fish was cooked perfect, but my sauce had a skin on it like it had been sitting for awhile. The fish was hot on the inside. I'm thinking maybe mine was ready before my husband husband's?? Is still tasted good and I ordered it with mashed potatoes and they were so delicious that I took home the left over. \nMy husband got the cheesecake which he said was ok. Only ate a few bites. I got the flourless chocolate cake and I loved it. I didn't think it was too rich. Thought it was the perfect sweetness.  I plan on returning. I know my husband eats here often for work, so he's definitely returning. I think the $26 is a great value for everything you're getting."

I wasn't overwhelmed, but wasn't underwhelmed either - would leave it as an A-OK. The service was fine, but as the only female at a table with 6 other men, I would have expected that they would have served me first from a manners perspective, and that wasn't the case (the waitress took my salad order and then moved on, and left the table before realizing that she hadn't taken my entree order as she had everyone else's). I started with the Iceberg Lettuce Wedge (Danish blue cheese, toasted walnuts, bacon, cherry tomatoes,\nchives and fried onions - although I asked them to go light on the bacon). This was a good wedge and I went for the slightly smaller option, which was plenty. As my main, I had the 9 ounce Filet Mignon, cooked medium. It was cooked to perfection and the steak was certainly tasty. For the family style sides, I tried the Goat Cheese Whipped Potatoes and I do love me some goat cheese, which you could taste in the potatoes, but I think they needed a bit more whipping as they were lumpy. For dessert, we shared the doughnuts in a bag (and they do come to the table in a bag) and they were just OK. The wines we had were both great. All in all, it was a good evening (and one I wasn't paying for), however, I expect a bit more consistency at these types of prices at a restaurant, so that's why I'm giving it a solid 3-star rating."

It was huge. No way was that thing under a full lb. I ordered it medium expecting a perfect mid rare and that's exactly what I got. Tender, juicy, and delicious. It ranks up there with the best steaks I've ever had. At just under $50, it was almost a bargain when you consider that you normally pay $30 for a filet half the size.

Usually we try and switch it up with other restaurants in the area as we tend to stay at Caesars the few times we go every year. This past time we decided to try out this place other guests were raving about.  \n\nWe started with the \"Monday Night Salad\". With the right amount of anchovies and roasted red peppers with a nice creamy bleu cheese dressing this salad was a hit amongst the other patrons at the table. Other people in our party got the Caesar salad which they seemed to enjoy as well and we're happy the anchovies came on the side. \n\nFor another appetizer, we elected to get two lobsters for the table to share. The server explained they were 3 lb. freshly broiled Nova Scotia lobsters. I felt these would have been very good however, they may have been broiled a tad too long leaving the inside a little dry. Still good nevertheless but could have been great! Would like to try this again next time we visit and give this item another chance.\n\nSteaks were all very good. Sides excellent.

And to be quit honest the food was \"okay,\" but the service was superb. My family came for Saturday lunch to celebrate my dad's birthday and parent's wedding anniversary. \n\nTo start off the bread basket was obviously from a supplier and not baked in house. It was nothing special and was just sliced up rolls of bread, something they should work on. We asked for water initially and surprisingly they didn't ask if we preferred bottled or tap, I guess since we're Filipino they already knew to serve us tap. Hahaha! \n\nI ordered the 3 course Power lunch special ($26). Pretty good deal I must say. I had the clam chowder, nicely done and crackers were served on the side. For my main entree I had the filet mignon medallions which was \"okay\" not the tastiest but edible. I was expecting a lot since this place is known for steaks? I should of asked for the sauce to be on the side because it was taking the spotlight. I was disappointed but oh well what can I do? Finally dessert I had cheesecake to go because I was so full from everything else. When I ate it at home it was delicious and it was on the \"lighter, fluffier\" side in comparison to most cheesecakes I'm used to. \n\nIn addition to what I order I tried the crab cakes, which was my mom's entrees. And this was not good because it was made with curry?! I like curry but didn't expect it to be in the crab cake which in my opinion unfortunately made everything all bad.  \n\nI probably won't be back because I've had better steaks from places that are cheaper. This was a nice experience to splurge and indulge especially since Palm is known for having their patrons eat in the outside area of the restaurant while mall shoppers eye and droll the food as they walk buy. To give them some credit, the service was on point. Our waters never hit below half. Our party ordered a 5lbs lobster and was opened by the busser at our table. Not sure if he was a busser or our server's assistant because he was so good and on top of it. I don't remember his name but he was an older Hispanic gentleman in his 40s or 50s."

The meat literally melted in my mouth.  It was cooked to perfection.  \n- Salmon: Coworker ordered this as her main entr\u00e9e.  I didn't try it but she said it was tender and good.\n- Surf n turf:  Coworker ordered this and they brought out a huge tray with the lobster and steak.  The waiter cracks the lobster tableside!!  It was a generous amount too!!\n\nSide items:\n- Goat Cheese Whipped Potatoes:  This went away quick!  It was just perfect.  The perfect amount of goat cheese and it was creamy and flavorful.\n- Asparagus Fritti: Typical steamed asparagus, complemented my filet nicely.\n\nDeserts:\n- Bag of Warm Doughnuts:  They literally come out with these dougnuts in a bag and shake em for you.  Served with chocolate and raspberry sauce and whipped cream.  It was so good!!\n- Cr\u00e8me Brulee:  I'm a huge fan of cr\u00e8me brulee, and this did not disappoint! Served with various fruits.

However, I have nothing but good things to say about this establishment.\n\nFirst, the atmosphere is great.  I usually dine at the bar becuase that is where Tommy works, but even without that, this is the best place to be, in my opinion.  One night, I sat next to Pete Rose, who is a regular at the bar.  Tommy tells me all kinds of fun stories about the people he meets and the regulars that visit him at the bar.\n\nAs far as food, I highly recommend the tomato capri salad and the filet mignon.  I always get my steak prepared medium rare.  It usually comes out a bit on the rare side (which I like) so if you want medium rare by \"normal\" standards, you might want to order medium.\n\nThe calamari is also very good.  The only thing that I have ever tasted here that I wasn't a big fan of was the lobster bisque.  However, I have taken guests who really enjoyed it.  It might be a matter of personal taste.\n\nIf you go on the right night, there is an Elvis impersonator working as the bathroom attendant.  Gotta love Vegas!"

            "review": "Solid food, but the ridiculously bad service loses the Palm a star. \n\nWe were a large party of 8, all ordering steak and lobster and wine. You would think service would be pretty damn attentive. Unfortunately our waiter was complete aloof and often rude. Small details were overlooked (NO at a restaurant this expensive it is not acceptable to give ladies wearing black pants a freaking white napkin!). Stuff like this is forgiveable if the waitstaff has an ounce of warmth or personality. \n\nWe perused the appetizers on the menu and they were all pretty freaking dull. The lobster sliders and mini crab cakes from the bar menu sounded more appealing, but the waiter turned down our request to order appetizers from the bar initially. We asked \"what if we pay full price (it was happy hour)\" and he still said no. Five minutes later he akwardly returns and says he guesses he can let us?!?!? Thanks jerk. The apps from the bar menu were crappy and not worth it, btw. Oh well. \n\nThe surf and turf here is solid. It's not inspired or interesting, but it's reliable and of good quality. It is pricey for what you get, however, and the food didn't blow my mind. The four pound lobsters are HUGE I will say, and it's nice they split them for you. They also will crack the claw to make the enormous claw easier to eat. Props for that. \n\nDesserts weren't particularly interesting, either, but they were tasty. The key lime pie was my favorite - a very well done piece of pie. \n\nOverall this is your standard pricey steak joint. I had an amazing time at my dinner because I was in great company. Luckily the awful waitstaff didn't ruin our evening. With so many awesome steakhouses in Vegas I'm not sure if I'd come back to the Palm on my own. I will say if you're playing it safe in Vegas and want a well executed surf and turf, it's worth giving this place a shot."

My fav is West Hollywood because it pretty much became my home.  I did try San Diego but was disappointed...and then the manager emailed me and it was all good (tho I haven't been back so far I would go for the new piano bar to check it out).  So now...here is the Palm Las Vegas experience...LOVE it!  I'm not one to sit and continue to rant about one location not having the charm of another one...they are \"same~same but different\".  \n\nAt any rate, for a family dinner (grandma, grandpa, mom, dad and brother) we headed out to the Palm.  Mom and brobro ordered the Oscar...steak with crab and a bernaise sauce...pure heaven...as in tears to my eyes heaven.  My brobro saw them put it down in front  of mom and his mouth watered.  I ask you...who cares what everyone else ordered...the Oscar was the best dinner ever! Perfectly cooked filet mignon steak that melted in your mouth with a ton of crab on top...a brilliant surf and turf!!!  Cheese potatoes that may have taken one year off dad's life, asparagus with garlic and oil...delicious!  Okay okay..now what did  everyone else have?  Grandpa got the salmon (huge piece of salmon and really delightful) Grandma got the crab legs ~ huge!!! Dad and I shared the...now let's say it together because it's my favorite ~ the veal parm!  Awesome as always!  Our waiter was charming and fun - a really wonderful server who earned his $$$$ that night.  Lively atmosphere, very busy...highly recommend heading there.  It really retains the charm of and quality of the Palm family.  I took off one star for a simple reason...in West Hollywood there is a manager who walks around to your table and treats you like you're part of the family.  He's wearing a suit, he has a smile...flirts with the ladies and makes the men feel like their kings.  It makes a huge difference..that's what I call service!  They also have the wine guy (I know what they are called but can't spell it...sommilier...???) who comes over to talk to you about wine...it's  just a great feeling...takes two minutes (if that) and really makes you feel good!  That's what Vegas needs..I mean come  on...it's Vegas..that's what it's all about!  Make us feel like high rollers...we just spent $500 bucks on dinner and want to feel like we own the world!"

            "review": "Last week I visited Las Vegas-my friend and I decided we really wanted some good seafood. Upon pulling out my handy dandy Yelp app, we came across Palm. Granted, neither of us are under 21 but I guess we still look pretty young. We ordered a bottle of the Pinot Grigio. He automatically carded us. I guess I'm not at the age where I appreciate being carded yet.. especially at a very fancy, expensive restaurant. What did he think? That we were two 19 year old girls getting dressed up and wanting to spend over $100 each just to get some booze?! I found it to be pretty tasteless since usually nicer restaurants are not supposed to do that. The thing that made it the most tasteless was his sarcastic attitude.  \n\nWe ordered our main course (filet with lobster tail) and calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was way too greasy for me and the marinara sauce it came with for dipping was very bland. My friend and I both agreed on this. The main dish was delicious, we split a filet and lobster tail. \n\nOverall the positive for me was the main dish (it was a pretty small portion since we split it). The service and the appetizer were both very average. I realize that almost everywhere you go on the strip is going to be overpriced, but damn.. this place was really overpriced! After a bottle of wine, calamari appetizer, and one entree, we ended up spending about $115 each. I would not go back."

I'm a huge carnivore and I am a self proclaimed steak house connoisseur. So it is a little odd for me that neither time did I have steak. Both times were for their Sumner Lobster Fest. Oh yeah.... So amazing from the greeting, to the service and the food as well. Our server was a sweetheart and apparently has been there since they first opened like 20 years ago. Everyone in our group went for the lobster special which started with a salad or lobster bisque. I only ate broccoli and humus all day in preparation for the bisque and its rich creamy delight. My friend opted for the Cesar (which was delicious but not to ever be considered into the same ballgame as the bisque). She was worried she was going to be on lobster overload, however, one bite of my bisque and she had a brand new outlook on life. Next came the lobster which came nice and neatly split not to mention declawed by the staff tableside. We had a plethora of sides including lobster mac n cheese, potatoes at gratin, pancetta green beans and lemon zest broccoli. So much great food! Will be back soon!"

Since I had been sick the day prior, it was important that we were able to share it, which we were informed would not be a problem.  My girlfriend had just bought a large frozen drink for our expected walk down to the Palazzo (before we spontaneously stopped into The Palm).  Luckily, unlike many other places in Vegas, they did not put up a big stink about her bringing the cocktail in.  Our server was so great, attentive, yet not meddling.  Our water glasses were always filled in as needed.  Unsure between the Caesar Salad and Chicken Noodle Soup as our first course (due to some hangover recovery dietary needs), our server surprised us by bringing both!  We got the Chicken Parm, which was good...if anything maybe the tomatoes a little too sweet, as the main dish and the half chips/half onion rings as the side.  It was so much food that I can't imagine anyone finishing a Lunch Special by themselves.  Even with two of us, we brought about half of it home.  The cheesecake dessert was also delicious."

            "review": "Palm Restaurant seems to be one of those places that, every single time you mention the name, someone who's been there goes \"Ooh I love that place, you need to try the _____, they have the best _____!!! Oh my god, it's sooo good!\" Every time I've heard that, it was a completely different menu item. That's how I knew Palm had to be on my list of places I absolutely have to try. So the other day, on my birthday, I finally tried it. \n\nI don't even know where to begin with the list of reasons I love this place. I guess I'll start with the decor, since that's the first thing you notice. The place may not seem like much, being in the middle of a high volume shopping area. But it's a high dollar, high volume shopping area. So at least you know it's not gonna be like a mall's food court or something. I chose to eat inside. The place has a nice old school restaurant kind of charm to it. There are drawings all over the walls but the servers are dressed nice, mostly the customers are all dressed at least somewhat formally as well. I don't think you'd necessarily be out of place if you were dressed down a bit either. Even though I wasn't seated near it, the bar seemed pretty cool. I had a good enough view from my table to keep an eye on the score of the Jets game (Bonus Points, but really, Go Giants!). \n\nNow on to the next thing you'll notice; the service. The service at this place is outstanding!! Honestly, outstanding isn't a good enough word for the service. I'm just too lazy to pull up my computer's thesaurus, so I guess, just deal with it. These people hustle, old-school Vegas style! Glasses were never empty and everything was prompt. It may be because they knew it was my b-day, but they were like extra awesome to us. I got a personal handwritten birthday card, they made it rain birthday confetti on my table (I swear I'm not making any of this up!!), and after the meal, I got a giant slice of this phenomenal cheesecake along with a few cups of pretty good coffee, all on the house. How awesome is that?? The busboy was from New York too; being all New Yorkers, we B.S.'ed quite a bit about back home. Just even more personal touches on top of the others. Good things, good things. The server on the other hand, had a very thick asian accent; we couldn't understand her very well. It still wasn't bad enough to even take off a half of a star, which is good, because I can't technically do that, even if I wanted to. Moving on..\n\nSo I guess even phenomenal service wouldn't earn a 5-star review if the food wasn't top notch. In this case it was pretty damn close to top-notch. I got the bone-in ribeye and their french fries. If I had never eaten Firefly's incredible fries this place would have taken the title of my favorite french fries in this town. So Palm will have to settle for second place in the fry department. Now as far as the main dish; Palm made the best Ribeye I have had in Vegas so far. Dry-aged (expect nothing less for $40 or so) and cooked to perfection. It was juicy on the inside, and seared wonderfully on the outside. It had a great flavor as well; not overly seasoned but seasoned just right. I don't mind getting a $40 steak when it tastes that good and is that filling. I was stuffed. It was a struggle to even put a dent in that cheesecake afterward. And this boy can eat!! I swear I must be 400 pounds on the inside somehow. Or maybe just in another life. \n\nSo there you have it folks. I finally tried one of the like 10 steakhouses that I hear people rave about in this town. And I happened to love it. \n\nOh by the way, when anyone asks me about Palm my response is going to be... \"I love this place, you need to try the bone-in rib eye. They have the best rib-eye!! Oh my god, it's soooo good!!\" Yea, I guess I drank the koolaid too."

I ate it anyway, not worth it to send it back. \n\nI also ordered the three cheese potatoes au gratin. Very rich and tasty, but temperature wise, not all that hot. \n\nMy husband and I shared the Caesar salad to start. Tasted fresh and was good. Perhaps a tad too much dressing. I should have asked for it on the side. \n\nMy husband opted for pasta (I know, we are weird!!!) and the pasta was cooked nicely al dente. \n\nTo finish off the meal we ordered the WARM BAG OF DOUGHNUTS. Let's be honest, that's the real reason I booked a res at this place. The doughnuts came out warm and in a paperbag that was shaken by the server.....\nThe doughnuts were a little too overcooked but still tasted good when dunked in chocolate and raspberry syrups and whipped cream. \n\nThe meal did the trick, but I am not aching to go back.

I mean we were just letting you know how it literally all went down."

My girl friends and I  tried eating at another popular place close by, but the wait was 30 minutes and we didn't want to wait.\nWe made our way thru Cesar's Palace and we didn't want any kind of Italian/pasta food. So, Yelp led us to Palms.\nThe inside seemed so dark, so we opted to sit out on the patio. Much more brighter and more easier to \"people watch.\"\nWe were immediately given some water and the breadbasket. Which, by the way had such great tasting bread! We finished the whole thing!  The bread was soo soft and fluffy.\nThe lunch menu had a great deal, which was the 3 Course Power Lunch meal, but I didn't want to be too stuffed and not fit into my clothes for the evening. Haha!\nI opted for the Bozzi Burger (medium well) which had aged gouda, smokey barbecue sauce and crispy fried onions. YUM!\n\nWe also got a bottle of prosecco for the table. It was a mix of the 2 menus I was holding and the waiter not grabbing them at the right moment, but we bath managed to make my friend's glass fall and break on the floor! I was definitely not drunk! But, after he and several waiters cleaned up the mess, he graciously gave me another \"heavy\" poured glass and the issue was forgotten. They did said that spilled champagne was good luck! And who doesn't need good luck in Vegas, right?!?! =)\n \n\nAs for my burger. OMG. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The patty was cooked perfect and was very juicy. Every time I took a bite, juice was coming out of the burger! I loved the combination of (tangy and sweet) bbq sauce and crispy fried onions. All the staff members were beyond friendly, we managed to chit chat with at least 3 in our area. The service was perfect."

All items are $3.50 except for the oysters which are $1 each.\n\nWe sampled the following 5 items:\n\nKOBE BEEF SLIDERS: bacon, lettuce, tomato and pesto aioli\n\nFILET MIGNON CAPRI SANDWICHES: imported mozzarella di bufala, tomato and basil with a balsamic aioli\n\nMINI BROILED CRAB CAKES: mango salsa and chipotle tartar sauce\n\nVEAL PARMIGIANA SLIDERS\n\nPOINT JUDITH CALAMARI FRITTI: cornmeal dusted and tossed with lemon and cherry peppers\n\nOverall the serving sizes were good, especially for the price. Our favorites were the filet mignon and kobe beef sliders, three per order. The veal parm was pretty tasty, but nothing special. The remaining two items were mediocre. The calamari batter was a bit too thick and soggy. The three mini crab cakes were very small and consisted of mostly filling and little meat.\n\nWhen my wife, an unapologetic diet Coke fiend, ordered her favorite beverage, they brought her a diminutive 6oz bottle with a cup of ice. Now $3.50 for a small soda with no refills is pretty steep, but I guess that's where they make some money after giving you a good deal on the food.\n\nAdditional menu items which we did not try this time:\n\nULTIMATE CHICKEN STRIPS: panko and parmesan battered with sweet and sour chili sauce\n\nPRIME CHEESE STEAK: prime New York steak, caramelized onions and Vermont cheddar cheese\n\nOYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL\n\nJUMBO SHRIMP COCKTAIL\n\nWill we return? Probably, at some point. We'd like to try some of their other items, but we'll stick with our faves and ice water next time around."

The plate was piled high with them fries, then topped off with another pile of  strings of thinly battered and fried sweet onion that has a perfect balance of crunchiness and sweetness.  I'd go back just for them fries and rings too!\n\nOscar style Filet Mignon, where do I start!

Finally, a chance to take advantage of it! \n\nWe chose a table outside so we could people watch, but we ended being the ones to watch!\n\nTheir current promotion is the Classic Summer Lobster Dinner for 2.  So what does that mean?  For $89.95, you get a four pound Jumbo Nova Scotia Lobster, split for two.  It's served with a choice of a mixed green or Caesar salad (or soup of the day), and one Signature side dish.\n\nA glance at the neighboring table and you can't help but want one for yourself.  So what was supposed to be a birthday lunch ended being a heavy early birthday dinner! \n\nThey start you off with bread and butter and we chose their soup of the day, which was Cream of Mushroom. \n\nWith bibs on, our lobster arrived - and what a sight it was.  The tomalley, aka lobster liver, oozes out onto the platter.  The waitstaff artfully removes the meat from the giant claws with a break and a pull.  We immediately start digging in and it doesn't take long to enjoy the fatty rich taste of this delicacy.  As I get started on my tail portion, I'm in need of some drawn butter to give it some added fatty richness!  (This the part where pedestrians can't help but point at what you're eating!  A four pound lobster is huge and it's an easy sell for the restaurant for those dining outside with it!) \n\nThe Wild Mushrooms, our side dish, is a nice medley and cooked in more butter!  This lunch is heavily loaded!\n\nAs we finish our last few bits, I am stuffed!  \n\nBut...the Husband has informed the staff that it's my birthday and out the staff comes to sing me a song and present me with a complimentary birthday cheesecake!  It was rich and pretty good!  Yum!    \n\nService was good - we had a leisurely lunch and the staff were professional.  There was a slight gap when we needed to wave down someone for more water, a napkin, etc. \n\nThey do offer their 837 Club where a $25 enrollment fee will give you a $25 gift certificate for the restaurant and you can earn points towards free meals, etc.\n\nUltimately, when it comes down to it, I love the Husband's version of lobster more.  Sure, theirs was good - but his homecooked version has me wanting more.  Therefore, we probably won't be back for their lobster special, but eventually will get around to trying their $23.95 three course business lunch!"

They tried to talk our group into a 10lb lobster to share but it looked so big we were sure we'd need more people to consume.  As I'm writing this review, I'm thinking of making a plan to go there again this week."

The wait staff here are real pros who know how to deliver an excellent dining experience.  You are going to get terrific old school food and terrific old school service.  \n\nBe forewarned, though, this place can get pricey quick.  Lunch for two with tip was about $220.00 for drinks, salads, steaks, one side split two ways, and coffee.  The specials are often good bets.  See my previous review below."

It was a tradition I looked forward to, especially the lobster bib!\n\nUntil now.\n\nThank you, Palm, for providing the worst dining experience I have experienced in Las Vegas.  \n\nEver.\n\nFrom the pompus, rude 'gentleman' at the host desk (thank you for turning your back on my mom while she was asking you a question - way to make the guests feel special!) to the rushed and perfunctory service from our waiter you have more than assured me that I will never again set foot in this establishment.\n\nThe highlights included: \n- The most indifferent and rude 'greeting' from the excuse of a person at the host stand. Yes, Mr. Personality, I DO have a reservation.\n- No greeting from our waiter - he merely opened his notebook and asked what we wanted.  Were there specials? Anything we should be aware of on the menu? We will never know.\n- The waiter bringing me the wrong wine selection twice and then arguing with me about what I actually ordered.  I had to show him both the name and number on the wine list - twice.  I did eventually receive what I requested - a small miracle.\n- The same waiter slamming down our shrimp cocktail (presented slapped on a bed of lettuce rather than in the standard iced bowl, with only four on the plate rather than the usual five) and salads (a three year old could have made these look better) at the same time on the table while mumbling that they were 'busy'.\n- I had to ask for water, bread and yes, even a FORK.\n- Lobster should not be served partially raw.  No.\n\nI could go on, but writing this just makes me annoyed all over again."

This steakhouse is obviously very famous and has a great location near the entrance to the Forum Shops from the casino at Caesars.  If I had to give one tip, it would be not to forget about this place for lunch.  Excellent burgers, I'm partial to blue cheese, which is of excellent quality here.  It's more expensive than other lunches, but it's certainly worth it.\n\nAt dinner, the wine list is solid, but certainly not the best on the strip.  The crabcake is solid.  The chipotle tartar sauce is a welcome departure from the usual sauce.  It has a nice flavor with some kick, but certainly not too much.  Potatoes au gratin probably our favorite side.  The steaks are all prime.  You don't need a sauce, but the best one I've had here is the brandy peppercorn.  Neither ingredient is overpowering, but both are certainly there.  It's a nice achievement.  I request that you order fried onions to eat with your steak.  They are very thin and the juice from the steak soaks into the onions, which brings the two together.  Every lobster we've ordered here has been perfectly prepared, hot and tender.  \n\nIn the end, it's not a cheap meal, but it's very good quality and you won't regret it."

            "review": "Located in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace.  The restaurant motif is consistent with other Palm Restaurants.  The walls are decked out in hundreds of Caricatures of celebrities over the past fifty years.  The restaurant is generally pretty crowded so waits can be a while.  But consider that you're inside an amazing shopping mall so just take your 45 min wait and get some shopping done.\n\nLobster - I've tried the lobster on two different occasions.  They are monsters!  The first one was 5 1/2 lbs and the second was 6 lbs!!!  Both times, it was $23 per lb so do the math and it gets pretty steep.  If you get some sides (highly recommend the hashed browns), then you can split the lobster and be pretty stuffed.  Typically lobsters of this size are tough, chewy, with little flavor (the ideal size for texture anf flavor should be 1 1/2), but it was still great.  It's definitely more about the novelty of eating a lobster claw the size of your hand than it is about fine-dining.  \n\nThe way the Lobster is cooked and served is split down the middle and broiled.  It's sprinkled lightly with parsley and served with drawn butter and lemon wedges.  Its not the best Lobster I've had, but its definitely the biggest and most satisfying serving of lobster I've ever had.  Either way, its definitely something to try.\n\nFilet Mignon - What a disappointment.  The first time around, it was bland, dry, and tough.  I specifically ordered Medium Rare and it was served medium to medium-well.  The second time I ordered it, again, it was bland, tough, and even MORE dry.  Granted the Filets are about 2 1/2 - 3 inches thick so its a little difficult to cook the steaks properly without charring the surface to hell.  Nevertheless, I was horribly disappointed on both occasions.  \n\n*Note - I tried the Bone-In Rib-Eye at the Los Angeles Location and it was a great steak.  Juicy, flavorful, and seared to perfection.  Perhaps the Filet Mignon is just the Achilles Heal of The Palm."

I told he bar tender and she promptly brought me the cheese. When when brought me the cheese she gave the excuse that the kitchen staff was just waking up and that is why my order was wrong. Also,the cheese the kitchen served had started to go bad.

I had the petit filet mignon and it was fine, but nothing spectacular.  The asparagus side was delish, highly recommend that. The service was not good. We had to mention many times that we only had 90 minutes to be in and out of there as we had a show, and while our server kept insisting that our meals were \"on their way\"...we waited an inexcusably long time.  The restaurant was not very busy for 8pm on a Saturday night, so we were surprised by the slow service.  I hope this was just an off night. I might try it again sometime, but hope it is better than what we just experienced. We have friends who rave about the one in San Diego...so??"

New York strip was cooked to a perfect rare and had optimum seasoning. Its juiciness and char-grilled crust really seals the deal. The lobster tails were cooked to perfection, succulent, and sweet. The drawn butter brought even more sweetness out of each tasty morsel. Thumbs up, way up!\n\nThe Brussels Sprouts were perfectly cooked. But it was a little too heavy on the lemon. It definitely needs to be toned down a bit or else sprinkle lemon zest on top for a nice zing.  \n\nThe French fries are topped with parmesan and garlic. These fries are da bomb! It's made with fresh cut potatoes with a light, crispy outside and tender inside with a hint of kettle chip flavor. The parmesan garlic seasoning is perfect.

Their lobsters were from Nova Scotia and tasted great without needing any seasoning or butter. The half lobster on my plate also came with some browned lobster \"liver\" and that was the first for me and I ate it all. My filet was cooked perfectly to my preference: medium rare and it was tender and juicy inside and seared brown outside.  For desserts we had New York cheesecake (rich creamy and slightly tangy), flourless chocolate cake (dark chocolate & creamy) and creme brulee; everything was fantastic. The restaurant is located in the Ceaser's Palace Hotel right at the entrance of the \"Forums\" so you can do some window shopping afterwards at some of those expensive designer brands clothing shops."

I give 4 and 1/2 stars on the food, 5 stars on service and 3 stars on ambience. \n\nFood:\n1. Crab cakes: it was pretty good but I had better else where. I didn't care for the seasoning of the crust. \n2.Calamari: it's not bad at all but I haven't had any bad calamari in a long time lol \n3.Lobster: it was sooo yummy and fresh! I love it ! \n4.Chilean sea bass with tomato and mushroom sauce(special of the day) : fish was very fresh and sauce was light and flavorful. I like it a lot.\n5. Sides: I like saut\u00e9 mushroom and saut\u00e9 spinach. Cream corn and creamy spinach were just okay. \n\nWe also ordered a bottle of red and champagne. Don't remember the name but both were very good. Total overall experience was awesome besides the ambience. I think it was quite noisy there and I was not a fan of the decor inside. If we have to spend $1000 on a meal, I would expect the place looks little bit more upscale."

I was starvingggg and just excited to get some food before the alcohol! Happy Hour is only available at the bar and not the dining area which left me a little confused but whatever, I like sitting at the bar anyway-- it lets me see my options of poison. ;) for $3.50 appetizers and I think $1 oysters, WHY THE HECK NOT!? \n\nWe started off the night with some beers and they had a really nice selection of beers on tap. \n\nWe then proceeded to order the following:\n- Crab cakes: These were good. They come with I believe house fried potato chips which could have been salted a little more and maybe fried longer for a more crispy crunch, but it didn't bother me too much. It came with a mango salsa dip which made the chips taste a lot better. The crab cakes were good but definitely not the best I've had. I may try this again, but I'd have to be really hungry and nothing else was available on the menu. (i mean when you can choose kobe beef sliders, crab cakes seem nothing but a distant memory!)\n\n- Philly Cheese Steak: My boyfriend adores philly cheesesteaks! I don't know if its the cheese or all that grease, but he loves this stuff. Too bad it wasn't all that great. I was pretty full after one (It comes with 3) and it was pretty bland tasting. This also came with their house potato chips. \n\n- Raw Oysters: We ordered four of these which was good enough to taste since my boyfriend hadn't had oysters in a really long time. It came with the usual cocktail sauce. I really liked slurping these bad boys down! Its really hard to go wrong with raw oysters so I guess they did well in my book!\n\n- Kobe Sliders: Originally ours only came out with 2 which we were unsure of and a little suspicious since I think it was supposed to come out with three? When we were done paying a server brought out one last slider for us saying that the chef said that he had forgotten one. I thought that was a nice gesture but it was pretty late and I was pretty full. Still from what the boyfriend and I had, this one was the winner for the night. It was juicy, the buns were sweet and it had all the right flavors.  I think we wanted to order another one from the menu when this had first came out but their kitchen closes at 10PM. \n\nWe have fallen in love with this place and its probably one of my favorite happy hour spots of all time! Our bartender was more concerned in closing up shop at her bar and didn't bother us much which I was fine with. It was a nice first night in sin city for us and we were completely satisfied. I will definitely make my way here again!"

Bad move on my part--and thankfully the only shitty thing I did this Vegas trip--but one star to the Palm for accommodating our last minute 18-person reservation (I should've taken a hint from the fact that this restaurant wasn't packed to capacity.)...\n\nWelp, that's about where the pros end. Our food wasn't served until OVER AN HOUR after we had ordered. Unbelievable. The filet mignon I ordered 'medium' was overdone and flavorless, and our waiter did not come by once to ask how anything was. The three cheese potatoes au gratin were good, but not worth writing home about. My boyfriend had no complaints about his chicken parm, but he is easily pleased, hence why we've been together for so long *ba dap ch*.\n\nThere was also a whole ordeal with splitting the check. You'd think an \"upscale\" restaurant like this would have an efficient, hassle-free way of doing this, but nope. That debacle added even more time to our almost 2.5 hour dining fiasco.\n\n*OVERALL: huge waste of time and money.\n\nThe highlight of any dining experience, IMHO, should be the food or the service and the Palm lacked in both. Weirdly enough, the highlight of my evening were the girls who were so unbearably cold during our long wait for food that they wore borrowed chef coats and didn't mind looking like they were in straight jackets. :)"

Just thinking about them make my mouth water. Juicy, buttery, creamy, garlicky, and crunchy all packed into a little morsel of bottom-of-the-sea mussel gift from Poseidon himself. What's left on the plate is a swirl of oily golden nectar, perfect for taking Palm's fresh bread slices, seeping up the juices, and inserting it straight down your throat. It's hard to not get full before your tray-tray comes (that's what I call entrees) \n\nI used to be a sole prime-rib-only type of child, but started eating filets when we began to frequent The Palm. The problem is that when you order a Palm filet (or any filet, for that matter), you really need to add sauce or reduction because there just isn't that much flavor to the cut of meat, it's all tender, melty goodness (which is far from a bad thing). More recently, I've been eating the ribeye which is just packed with delicious meaty goodness, like a cow jumped right into your mouth and rendered it's fat and juices right on your tongue. If you don't like my imagery, it's a nice, tender, and juicy cut of meat with excellent flavor, well seasoned. \n\nThe sides are a whole 'nother ball game, large and perfect for sharing. For a party of more than 3 people, it's necessary to order the three cheese potatoes (creamy, heavy, and perfect), wild mushrooms (earthy and garlicky), the hand cut french fries (crisp and golden brown with great seasoning), and I also get a baked potato for myself and myself only (the baked potato is an ordinary, oversized steakhouse potato, but it's always necessary for me to have one at a steakhouse, weird habit)\n\nNow for zerts\nI've never gotten anything else from here for dessert other than their gazillion layer chocolate fudge cake. it's one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Moist, rich, dark, and sweet...it's incredibly difficult to finish when you eat everything that was mentioned above, but if you push yourself hard enough, you can finish it, and feel extremely guilty afterwards as you walk back to your hotel stuffed with hundreds of dollars of food in your belly thinking about all the hungry people in the world."

It is this reason that I got excited the other day while reading a little blurb on Eater Vegas about a burger deal at the Palm Restaurant in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. The starting price was still almost twice the price of some stand out cheap meals I've had, but could this discount help out?\n\nI've already gotten into how much I hate parking at Caesar's so I won't get into that again. I didn't really step foot into the restaurant past the hostess counter because I sat on their 'patio' to people watch tourists in the mall while I ate my burger. It seemed dark, intimate and 'fancy' if you will; you can probably find better information in their gallery than from me. The patio area has about 14 tables directly within the shopping corridor and really does make for great people watching as you eat, or if you're cocky to be seen eating here. The lunch and dinner menus vary quite a bit, with only one burger available on the dinner menu at over $18. The lunch menu gives you the choice of four specialty burgers at $16.90, and a basic one at $14.90.\n\nI went with the 837 Club Burger which as prosciutto di Parma, roasted red peppers, pesto aioli and fontina cheese. My burger came out, and it was huge. So big that I actually slowed down a bit towards the end despite being absolutely starving coming into my meal. The meat had excellent flavor, was cooked almost to order although there were a few random spots of grey. The Peppers had great flavor and the burger was very cheesy and tasty. The aioli was sharp and also very good. The bun was a tiny bit too thick and dry, but was well proportioned to the meat so it ended up being ok. The accompanying lettuce, tomato and onions were not necessary as the various tasty toppings did the trick.\n\nThe fries were excellent too; seasoned and cooked well with some a bit undercooked and some crispy. A good variety of textures with none being bad. This was a welcome addition to my meal after encountering so many great burgers with bad fries around town. My normally $16.90 burger cost me $8.37 which I found to be a fantastic deal for what I was given. Even at almost $17 I probably wouldn't have complained too much for the quality, although once you start comparing it to others that cost a fraction of the price you can certainly make arguments against it. Either way, if you happen to be at the Forum Shops this is a great burger."

We actually had to flag him down at one point with empty wine glasses and an empty bottle to get him to recognize that we needed to order another bottle. Our party of six was treated like an annoyance to a guy that had four entire tables to serve. \n\nThe atmosphere was noisier than expected with substantially more amplification of conversations than other locations."

This is a place for drunken carnivores. \n\nI have been to The Palm three times now and I can safely say that I do not like their steaks. They promote simplicity but I think that they seriously discount flavor. The veal chop, on the other hand, was outstanding. It now gives me something to look forward to if I am drug in here (again) against my will. The three cheese potatos were very good. The waiter was fully capable of handling seven drunk, hungry almost 50 year old men. You could tell this wasn't his first rodeo. Only gripe about the service was that when it was time for the check, he disappeared for about 10-15 minutes (why do waiters do that?). \n\nIf you want the testosterone fueled steak experience, this is your place. Upturned face."

We walked in at 10:15ish on a Friday night and were told the kitchen was closed.  Come on!\n\nI asked them to serve us and found out that the kitchen was actually open, she just didn't want to serve us (she eventually warmed up).  I soon realized while trying to enjoy some food, that the staff hates their customers and endlessly bitches about people coming in late (but they were seated so the restaurant was obviously still open).  One server was so angry that a table kept ordering bottles of wine and food.  He'd rather go home 45 minutes (too) early than make a $100-$200 tip?  Silly boy.\n\nThe happy hour food menu was $5/dish and that's amazing!  We had 3 Angus sliders, 3 very high quality lobster sliders, and 3 crab cakes all for $15!!!! Wow!  The crab cakes were shamelessly small but still worth the price, burgers were good quality but nearly bite sized, and the lobster was fresh and tasted wonderful.\n\nI'd go back if the timing was perfect, but I'll lower my expectations about the staff and their vocal chatter.  Too bad because this is The Palm, not some crappy chain restaurant."

We had a good sized party and absolutely everyone was thrilled with their food.\n\nThe service was okay, but unremarkable. Definitely had better service at some other high end steak houses, but it certainly wasn't bad.\n\nThe big problem with the Palm is the ambiance and the space. They literally cram as many people as possible in there. You get absolutely no room whatsoever as other diners and staff are totally on top of you. Additionally, the acoustics are horrible and the sound just bounces all over the place. As a result of that, and all the people they pack in there, the Palm is one of the loudest restaurants I have ever eaten at. Good luck holding a conversation with someone.\n\nDespite how good the food is, I doubt I will be back unless they move to a bigger space with more room and better acoustics. Las Vegas just has way too many good restaurants to bother going to a place this loud and cramped."

I've eaten at the Palm in most major cities and had the most magical dinner at the original in NYC. What a great place to start to form a love for incredible food. \n\nUnfortunately, like the mall it's in, it's a glitzy place with no substance (sorry, Caesers). \n\nA friend and I walked in right on time for our reservation and were made to wait after we declined to sit at the bar (the hostess tried to convince us that eating in the bar was an option for reservations even though there were many empty tables - rude). Finally we got a table and from then on the experience got a bit better. \n\nService here is impeccable. Our water glasses stayed filled, plates were taken away, everyone was very polite and efficient. That is the best part of this restaurant.\n\nThe bread basket was delicious, it has several different kinds served with butter. We each ordered steak, that is why we came. I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my friend ordered the filet mignon. We also ordered three sides: mushrooms, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.\n\nI usually love sides, I think they can be an incredible accompaniment, but these were so bad we didn't even touch them. \n\nThe mushrooms were clearly soaked in vinegar. The sharp acrid taste was so overwhelming that the taste of mushrooms was clearly lost. The mashed potatoes had goat cheese mixed in, which I'm not a fan of, but the potatoes were fluffy. I just can't eat goat cheese. Blech. The creamed spinach was overwhelmingly creamy, almost too thin to eat with a fork. The taste was bland as though they had added too much tasteless cream. The spinach taste was also lost.\n\nI ordered my ribeye medium rare and it came out so rare that if it had been cooked any less it would have been raw. The meat was stringy and so fatty that I almost gagged. I ate a few bites and then asked for it to go. What? My dogs love undercooked, overfatty meat!\n\nMy friends filet was good, but I refused to taste it. After all this bad food my stomach was starting to hurt. Ugh. \n\nI'm extremely disappointed in the food at this restaurant. It was my first bad experience with the Palm, EVER (in 28 years). I would never go back here. Not for free, not for pay, never."

Excellent for the most part with the NY STRIP & The Rib Eye being the best of the bunch here.  A little disappointing Prime Rib is only available on Friday & Saturday night.  Their price Fix option of $49.00 with Salad, choice of a particular entr\u00e9e and dessert looks great but I have to believe the following.  The Filet Mignon is not the same as the menu item. All 3 were funny looking and gray.  Taste was ok but really a weak presentation.  Small 6 ounce Lobster tail was NOT 6 ounces and it was Ok but not great.   The  1/2 lobsters were much better with plenty of meat and great claws which were expertly cracked and deshelled tableside.  \n\nSides of Half & Half \"Cottage fries and string onions were on the money as well as the saut\u00e9ed wild mushrooms & Creamed spinach.  Lyonnais potatoes were good but Red Onions instead of traditional white did not do them justice. \n\nA nice giant piece of chocolate cake for the birthday boy was presented along with homemade whipped cream.  Couple of Espressos & Cappuccinos was consumed as well. \n\nNot a perfect night as the Filets & Lobster tails in the price fixe was weak but rest of the food was Top Shelf and service was impeccable as JR did a really great job... 4 Stars tonight!"

First, the positive.  1)  The location is fun.  Sitting on the \"patio\" at the Forum Shops location is great people watching for us Vegas locals; 2) The service was great.  Our hostess, waiter and busboy were all very friendly and attentive, however I will say that they were a bit too quick to want to remove my husband's salad before he was even finished eating it.  Now, the negative.  My lobster bisque was very good, I will give them that.  However, my filet oscar was not.  Although the filet was very very tender (no knife needed), it lacked any type of sear or flavor.  Honestly, it tasted like it came out of a microwave.  You know, like when you were in college and would take home steak to reheat later (because you're in college and steak was a commodity not to be wasted)....but it never tasted the same because a microwave kills the flavor and the texture.  Well, that was my steak.  it was gray, bland and mushy.  And the creamed spinach, well...it was nothing to write home about.  The first time I had creamed spinach was at a Palm in Chicago.  I fell immediately in love and I was forever in search of the perfect creamed spinach at each steakhouse I'd frequent.  But this time, alas, this time it was less than love.  Not even really \"like\" at this point.  I took the first bite and tasted vinegar.  No creamy cream, no garlic, no parmesan.  Just vinegar.  Bleh.    Unfortunately, it just wasn't the Palm of my memories and we won't be going back.  Thank you for the great service, but no thank you for the bland food."

I was not the one who picked the restaurant, and when I first went online to read about it, I was a little nervous after reading some poor reviews. \n\nWe had reservations at 9pm, so I was already very hungry when we got there. \nThe restaurant did not look fancy and had caricatures on the wall. \n\nI ordered a special they had where I got a 9unce filet mignon with lobster, and it was served with a soup or salad as well as a side. It was $59, which was kind of steep, but not all that much more than a steak by itself, especially if I were to order a side dish as well. \nFirst the salad came. It was a mixed green salad with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The dressing was simply awful. I do not know how you mess up a balsamic dressing, but it was really bad. Like I mentioned, I was hungry, so ate it anyway, although I commented to my cousin that it was really bad. \n\nThen the steak and lobster came. I will include a picture. \nIt came with asparagus and I ordered the side of green beans. The green beans ended up at the other side of the table, but when I asked about my side dish they brought them over. Frankly, the green beans were the best item I ordered. That is disappointing for a STEAKhouse. \nI expected something like a lobster tail, but instead there were random chunks of lobster, from the claw or whatever. I was disappointed. \nThen I tried the steak. I asked for it to be cooked \"medium\" and it appeared pink on the inside. But the steak was VERY dry and tasteless. I was very disappointed, especially for a steak that cost $50. My cousin gave me a piece of his ribeye, which was cooked medium-rare, and it was much more juicy. I just don't like it that rare. I ate a few more bites of my steak, but it was tough to swallow. It came with Bearnaise sauce on the side, which I tried and did not like. I asked the waitress for some juice and she came with some au jus and some horseradish sauce. I put the juice on the steak, but it was very salty, almost like soy sauce. It made the steak easier to swallow, but did not help, and even hurt the already poor flavor. I was hungry, and upset I spent $59 on a crappy steak, so I ate it anyway. I could have made a big deal and sent it back, but there were 11 other guys who seemed happy enough with their meal and I didn't want to be the one guy who complained and slowed everybody down. \nBut I should have. \n\nI thought of posting a negative review a few days ago, but thought I would call the steak house first, and tell them about my experience. Perhaps they would feel sorry and find a way to make it up to me. Perhaps they would give me a coupon or something I could use at another location, since there is another Palm steakhouse in Los Angeles. \nI called on Tuesday and spoke to a server and hostess, who was very helpful, and asked questions about my dining experience, and took my information and said she would look up the ticket info and have a manager call me back shortly. She called me back later and said a manager would call later. \nNo call. \nI called again on Wednesday and spoke to another gentleman, who was somewhat helpful, but didn't seem to know too much about the situation. He took my information and said I would get a call back later that night or perhaps the next day. \nNo call. \nI called again on Thursday, today, and after being put on hold for several minutes, finally talked to a manager named LARRY. \nHe was exceptionally rude and did not care at all about my personal dining experience. He simply read me the notes about the dinner, telling me what I ordered (even if he made a few mistakes) and pointing out that I did not complain at the time and ate the food. He also pointed out how they gave us free cake at the end. Oh, I thought that was for the BACHELOR, and not just because I didn't like my steak. Sorry, we spent almost $900 plus tip, I think one piece of cake is okay. Side note- the cake was by far the best thing I ate at the restaurant. Skip the meal, just get the cake. \nLARRY did not even apologize for my negative visit, and said he didn't know what else I wanted him to do. He did not even apologize for taking 2 days to talk to me (even if I had to call instead of him calling me back). \n\nMy meal was very unsatisfactory and LARRY the manager had terrible customer service. \nI would absolutely NOT go back to this restaurant. I am not sure why we went to this place to begin with, as there are many other steakhouses in Las Vegas that would be much better.   \nI do NOT recommend The Palm to anyone. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!\n\n*One side note I want to mention- our service at the restaurant was good. I do not have complaints about our waitress. She was nice and helpful and at least tried to make the meal taste better. I do not blame her for my poor experience. And I am quite impressed with the service of the rest of the staff after dealing with such an incompetent and rude manager."

We'd had a few cocktails, and some appetizers. Most of us were ready for a serious nosh session. Thankfully Rob P aka veeRob aka the Master of Disaster had a Happy Hour (Prime Time) menu for Palm saved on his phone.\n\nWe walked over, had a seat at the bar, and ordered off this heavenly Happy Hour Menu. 9:30-close. \n\nLet's start with the things I loved:\n\n--Service. Our bartender's name was Jax. I have a slight crush on her. She is pretty awesome. I should come back and talk to her. Hopefully she's not married or something.\n--Food. Awesome. I ordered the Steak sliders, the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and the Lobster BLT sliders. My total tab was under 20 bones.\n--The ambience. Perfect. I was able to hang out with my friends, and watch some basketball. All at once.\n\nI'd come back. This is a great spot for a date, business lunch, or whatnot. It's a tad pricey when it's not Happy Hour. I'll be a bargain shopper and come back during Prime Time.\n\nNext time, I'm coming back and trying the oysters. Only a $1.50 or so. Not bad. \n\nAnd yes, this is a multi-location restaurant (a chain). There are some locations in LA. This is just as good as the original in NYC. Git some."

I just don't know where in the list I want to place it. \n\nThe Palm Steakhouse, in Caesar's Palace, appears just like a good ole New York steakhouse - dark wood d\u00e9cor, white-coated waiters bustling around focused on their business.  In reading the reviews here, some folks complained about lousy service, others were happy with their service. On this visit, my first, our server was wonderful. Attentive, happy to help with questions, and quick with our food. \n\nBut let's get to the meat of this review - literally. The steaks. AMAZING!!  The Palm takes a minimalist approach - very little seasoning goes on the steak. It's grilled to perfection, and served just as nature intended. Pure meat. This was some of the tastiest beef I've had in a long time. Clearly, their dry-aging works wonders for flavor. \n\nI ordered the bone-in rib eye, and it was tasty, tender and had very little gristle. What a glorious piece of meat. My wife ordered the filet mignon. She likes this cut because of its less fatty make up, but in the end, even she liked mine better and ended up sharing with me. \n\nWe had drinks, they served some freshly baked bread slices with butter, and we had small fresh salads, but when I go to a steakhouse, for me, it's all about the meat. \n\nI highly recommend you visit the The Palm at Caesar's Palace. It's now in my top 5, and likely to end up in your top 5 as well."

This restaurant is located right inside the Forum Shops via the Caesar's Palace casino.  This is a chain restaurant that we've been to before when we were in LA, so we thought we'd give it a shot in Vegas.  The Palm is a steakhouse, but they do offer several other things.  We were some of the first people to arrive, so we got a nice spot outside the restaurant where we could people watch.  It's a fairly pricey restaurant for lunch, so if you're dining on a budget you may want to skip this place.  My wife and I both ordered the prix fixe lunch.  It came with salad or soup, entr\u00e9e, and a dessert for around $26 per person.  We both ordered the Caesar salad, mine was pretty good, but my wife had some brown lettuce in hers, so that was a bummer.  For our entrees, I ordered the two 4 ounce filet medallions, while my wife got the salmon.  I thought both were quite good.  For dessert my wife got the flourless chocolate cake, while I got the cheesecake with raspberry sauce.  Again, these were a very nice portion and were good.  All in all, there wasn't much to complain about.  Our service was good and we were in and out of here in less than an hour.  As I said before, it's a little pricey for lunch, but then again, so is just about everything in Vegas."

We went for lunch and I had their steak frites and, unfortunately, they were using really poor quality beef (a New York Strip but not a good one).  You do have to use less expensive beef than dinner to serve steak but still achieve a reasonable lunch price, but most restaurants like Lucques do not settle for lower quality; instead, they just showcase a cheaper cut like hanger steak.\n\nSince I went to the Downtown LA Palm for lunch, I did not get a chance to try their signature Prime steaks.  I could have tried them at my recent trip to the Las Vegas location (The Palm is located in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace), but I opted for one of their other signature items instead--lobster.  I had their jumbo lobster tail and it was actually pretty good.  The lobster was huge--it was almost a pound--and the lobster meat was good--fresh, moist, lightly sweet, and fairly soft.  The seasoning of the lobster was also good--flavorful with a little bit of spice but not overpowering.\n\nAlmost everything else was not good though.  The crab cakes were soft and mushy.  The baked clams were bad.  The clams were too small (very unlike the rest of the food here) and the clams were just rubbery and kind of bland.\n\nThe Jumbo Shrimp Bruno was surprisingly good though.  This was shrimp francaise sauteed in a butter sauce.  The shrimp was incredibly soft and while I am not a huge fan of restaurants that go overboard with the butter, the richness and butteriness of this dish really worked.\n\nThe sides ranged from just okay to bad.  I do not really like creamed spinach, but this one definitely had the creaminess and richness that creamed spinach fans would probably like.  The asparagus fritti (deep fried asparagus) was fine.\n\nThe hash brown potatoes were also okay, but they were nothing really special.  The green beans were bad.  They were overcooked and bland.  Maybe someone on the table asked for them to be served plain because they definitely seemed to be missing the garnishes of pancetta, pepper flakes and pine nuts.\n\nFor dessert, I tried the warm bag of doughnuts and they were very dense.  The doughnuts came with dipping sauces including chocolate and raspberry.\n\nWhile I did not try any of the steak here, the steak did look good.  Some of the cuts looked a little small, but the cooking on the meat seemed to be very nice.  The center of the filet I saw was nicely red and juicy.  My friend said the temperature of the steak was nearly perfect, but the seasoning was not that great (a little bland).\n\nPrices were very high.  Las Vegas restaurants tend to be overpriced and given that The Palm features high quality beef, it is no surprise that the food here is very expensive.\n\nService was awful.  While I would say the food was in the mediocre to occasionally decent range, the service we experienced was very bad.  Our server did not seem to be a server at all because it really felt like he did not know what he was doing.  For example, we were a big table and he took the first two drink orders, left and then came back with just those two drinks.  It looked like he was going to continue to do this (I guess because he only had two hands), but we stopped him and told him to put in the whole drink order at once.\n\nPutting in our dinner order took forever because our server just seemed to disappear for long stretches of time.  And when he was present, he had an abrupt approach that was a little off-putting.  He also did not seem to be getting everything down, but the restaurant was also very, very loud.  The food itself came out at a decent pace so maybe service would be better under a different server.\n\nAs mentioned, the restaurant was quite loud.  The atmosphere was kind of like an old-fashioned supper club.  Similar to the LA location, they have celebrity caricatures on the walls.\n\nGiven that The Palm has multiple locations throughout the country, I would not suggest heading here first for a high quality steak or a big lobster.  Carnevino in The Palazzo offers very high quality steaks and the sides and starters are much more unique and delicious than The Palm (plus, that restaurant is more unique to the area).  I think The Palm is really a last option given the high prices, the just okay food and the fact that it is a pretty big chain.\n\nAs mentioned, The Palm Restaurant is located in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace.  The Forum Shops offer both free self and valet parking."

            "review": "After 10 years of working in the service industry in fine dining restaurants, I have now officially had my worst dining experience, EVER! \n\nIt was my girlfriends first time in Vegas, so I thought I would treat her to a nice dinner and choose Palm due to its review and close proximity to where we were staying. Our server was great right off the bat; very friendly and bubbly and able to describe the menu and the evenings specials. We started with a beefsteak tomato Capri which was delicious. It goes down hill from here. I ordered the bone in ribeye medium-rare, sides of Au gratin potatoes and creamed corn, and my gf was convinced to order the nights special of prime rib instead of the filet mignon. The sides were more of a highlight than the prime beef. \n\nMy ribeye was cooked more to a black and blue than medium rare - it was okay since I prefer my steak to have its natural juices - but came out at a \"lukewarm\" temperature rather than warm or even hot. The prime rib must have been given a salt bath for 30 days because it was the most over salted piece of meat I've ever had the displeasure of tasting; no natural flavor existed. Maybe the meat was over salted to cover up its rancid flavor(I'll come back to that comment later). The server was made aware of the dislike of her meal and offered to replace the dish, but my gf had already lost her appetite, so we declined. Not another bite  was taken from the 28oz $60 prime rib by either of us.\n\nLater, our server came back to ask if we were finished eating, and I tell her yes, although there was still a significant amount of food still left on the plates. She quickly picked up our plates and rushed of to the kitchen. I raised an eyebrow to the fact that maybe she was just going to pack the leftovers to go. She returns with a desert menu and offers a desert on the house to make up for the prime rib.\n\nAfter eating the creme brulee (very good, by the way), the server returns with our check. I am now wondering where all our food had gone. I ask the hostess if they pack leftover meals to go and she tells me yes. I explain my situation, to take our meals home was not even offered. The hostess and two managers then seemed to be discussing the issue with the server who returned to apologize for the miscommunication error. The hostess returned to the table with the check and explained that it was MY fault I didn't relay that I wanted the food to go, despite more than 50% of the meal was left. She comped our drinks, but we were still charged for the rancid prime rib. I paid the bill, left a 20% tip and left to never come back again. \n\nEn route to our hotel/casino after dinner, my gf began to feel ill. She threw up what she had eaten, once having to run in to a random casino, and again when we arrived back to our room. I felt fine. We can only assume it was the prime rib that caused her to become ill. It was the only thing she had to eat that I didn't, which leads me to believe the prime rib was turning bad, so it was over salted to cover up the rancid flavor.\n\nAll in all, our server did a great job, except for the leftovers hiccup. The management staff seemed to be a bit snarky and unapologetic considering the experience. I will never return to this restaurant and I will definitely be spreading the word of our terrible experience."

Didn't care for the cottage fries, and suggest the option of a French Fry or some other potato.  Also had the vegetable du jour and the swordfish was served on a bed of broccoli.\n\nOK, found my new favorite desert--the Palm's Key Lime Pie!  It looks entirely different that most Key Lime pies in that there is no meringue and the color of this one looks like butterscotch.  But it is so dense, rich in citrus flavor and simply unbelievable--very homemade tasting.\n\nI really cannot endorse the Palm enough for this bargain ($24 for all three courses per person) and hope to have dinner there next time I'm in town."

Although I've personally had a better experience in other steakhouses, Palm Restaurant still has its own character and provides a finely cooked steak.  I'd still come to this restaurant if a friend wanted to go, but I wouldn't recommend this place to others.\n\nNOTE: My friend and I came here because we had the Amex $50 gift card which basically gave us a free steak.  I still consider overall value (price paid vs food & service received) from the total check price.  \n\nSetting: Spontaneous dinner to take advantage of the $50 Palm Restaurant gift card from Amex, Monday 08/29/2011.\n\nThumbs Up: Filet Mignon, cooked medium (chef cooks the steak to perfection).  Wild mushrooms side dish was delicious.\n\nThumbs Down:  Service staff not knowledgeable about the pairing the wines w/ their steak.  A merlot was recommended that tasted bleh w/ the Filet Oscar, but good w/ the wild mushrooms.  Black peppercorn sauce is not worth it, as it tastes just like spicy brown gravy.  DO NOT get the Half and Half side dish (basically potato chips and shoestring onion rings) because they don't cook it well - oil wasn't hot enough so the chips and onions basically absorbed too much of the oil, making it taste extremely greasy.  Creme brulee is too thick for my taste and the burnt top was too thick.\n\nTip: They offer a lifetime club for $25, but you get it back as a gift card.  It's worth it if you like to frequent this place."

It's of a higher level chain than your Cheesecake Factory in that they have a smaller menu with better items.\n\nThey are mainly good for steaks and seafood.  For seafood, they have a 3 pound, 4, 5, and maybe even 6 pound lobster.  You may not find that at too many places.  The food is of good quality.\n\nIf you think of restaurants on a scale, and there is a line down the middle, I would say that The Palm is around the 75% range.  Not the greatest, but better than the median range."

Definitely lots of value for your $25.95 lunch price tag.  Everything else was pretty standard, nothing that really blew my mind. \n\nPRICE: 4/5 stars\n\nFor $25.95, you will get full.  Sure this is vegas and you could get much more out of a $5.99 steak and eggs but we're talking about a nice steak at a steakhouse.  Compared to other steakhouse prices, there is definitely value to be had here.\n\nVARIETY: 3/5 stars\n\nIt's a steakhouse! Palm has meat for days.  There are seafood choices if someone in your party feels like indulging in something other than steak. \n\nSERVICE: 3/5 stars\n\nWaiters were dressed formally and the service was good..  When the waiters congregated and chatted (quite loudly) in the dining room, it took away from the ambiance of the restaurant.\n\nINTANGIBLES: 3/5 stars\n\nI've never seen so many cartooned framed pictures of celebrities.  It's kind of cool to look around the restaurant at the pictures.  Besides that, it seems like quite your typical dark wood furniture steak house.\n\nGood lunch at a nice price and we left happy. :) I definitely think the Business Lunch has great value if you were in the area and wanting steak for a reasonable price."

Our server had a great sense of humor and was told that all items with the icon of the palm next to it was a signature dish.  He did not disappoint.\n\nFor appetizers we ordered the Colossal Lump Crabmeat Cocktail, which the parentals devoured like it was going to flee.  Not a morsel was left and the lettuce that surrounded the crab meat was tossed to ensure all pieces were found and eaten.\n\nFor dinner, Pops had the Double Cut Lamb Rib Chops 18 ounce with fresh mint sauce.  The lamb was cooked to medium perfection and was consumed with each bone cleaned complete - the fresh mint sauce was a winner, where another serving had to be requested.\n\nMom had the Signature Palm Surf 'n' Turf - a 6oz petite filet mignon and a half a lobster.  That lobster must've been a really huge lobster because the half she received was bigger than the size of my entire hand!  Needless to say she enjoyed it so much that there were no words exchanged, no grunts, just the sound of the silverware hitting the plate....then *poof* it was gone.\n\nI had the Prime Bone-In Rib-Eye Steak 24 ounce (Hunk of Awesomeness) cooked perfectly at medium rare and the meat peeled off the bone like butter....I left no scraps and the only trace of evidence was the bone.\n\nThe sides we shared and recommend to anyone were the creamed spinach and the asparagus fritti (fried asparagus).  The creamed spinach is rich and similar to the ones they serve at the steakhouses such as Mortons and Wolfgang's.  But I totally enjoyed the asparagus fritti.  The asparagus was fried in a italian seasoned breading - not thick but very tasty.\n\nUnfortunately by the end of the entrees there was no more room for dessert...though if there was, I definitely would have loved to try the flourless chocolate cake and New York Cheesecake....for the next time :)  It would have been embarrassing if they had to roll us out of the restaurant...lol."

There's a lot of steak on it - flavorful, perfectly cooked steak. You'd probably need to eat only half. They also give you a TON of lettuce, palm, etc. with a great vinaigrette.  \n\nFor dessert, the server told us that we could get cheesecake, in addition to the key lime and flourless chocolate cake shown on the menu. She didn't need to say anymore. The cheesecake was fantastic. It's definitely New York cheesecake - HUGE piece (again, you probably only need half of it), dense and creamy at the same time, topped with strawberry sauce.

The calamari was overcooked and bland, I had to salt it. I planned on ordering the 9 oz. filet but the waiter told us it was \"Restaurant Week\" and we had a few options. I chose the Palm salad and filet with bearnaise sauce with crab meat. A dinner guest ordered the lobster bisque as his starter.  I of course had to try the bisque because they have one of the yummiest. Well this one was barely warm and not the bisque I've had in the past. It tasted pre-made, like they order it frozen and reheat. The crab on my steak was cold and fishy, my steak was chewy even though it was cooked perfectly. We didn't visit there because it was restaurant week, we just thought the special offer sounded great. I mean if they're going to cut corners they should serve a smaller steak instead of mediocre everything. I would have gladly paid 43$ for a great steak instead of 39.95 for what's supposed to be the same steak with sauce on it.  I also had to salt everything. I never salt my food. So Palm, you were a let down and I don't know if I'll visit next time I'm in town with so many new places to choose from."

I could have used a tad more dressing but it was yummy!\n\nThe only down side:  $45 for lunch for two salads and ONE glass of wine.  Ummm... that seems pretty steep to me.\n\nSide note: I've been to The Palm in other cities (even though they have closed most of them) and if you have room, definitely order the 7-layer carrot cake.  It's probably the best I have ever had!  You can buy The Palm cook book and they have the recipe in there, which is exactly what you get at the restaurant.  Very cool that they give you all of that info!  \n\nI would definitely head back, but probably for a couple glasses of wine and some appetizers."

Service generally just didn't seem to care or were extremely dismissive of myself and other diners who were dining alone. They weren't very busy but still slow (after almost 20 minutes of not seeing my waitress to try and order, I almost got up and left...which I should have done). The menu on OpenTable is not anything like what is actually available at the restaurant either which was very disappointing. \n\nIn general, the servers were just very unprofessional for a \"high end\" establishment. A small group of them were gathered in the corner (maybe 6 feet from me) and were doing nothing but talking trash about people well within ear shot almost the entire time. Not cool. \n\nThe food itself was barely edible. She asked me no less than 3 times how I wanted my burger cooked (med-rare/med). It came out as well done+. Since she had disappeared for 20 minutes and I was running really short on time at this point, it was a bit of a lost cause and I ate part of it since i was starving. Eventually the manager(?) came over and tried to make it right and he was very nice and apologetic. He was really the only positive part of the experience, everything else just plain sucked. \n\nI had to ask the waitress for every little thing which was super annoying. Silverware? Ketchup for my burger? C'mon, amateurs shouldn't be working at a place like this. Presentation was lackluster as well. Then it took at least 10 minutes to get anything. I was there for 1 hour+ and just disappointment to show for it. There's too many other great dining options nearby to bother with this place again."

And my server was terrific.\n\nThe bad part was the chicken parmesan.  Okay, maybe I wasn't thinking right yesterday, and I shouldn't have gone to the Palm for anything but a steak.  But this chicken was so overcooked and bland, it more than brought down the better parts of the meal.  The half and half chips and onions were equally bland and lifeless, almost stale.

Full of crab meat but also off in flavor. The bf said it tasted like curry. The bf's filet had more flavor only bc he had some sort of lobster brown sauce on top. The lobster bisque was good. A little salty and hardly any lobster chunks. The green beans were basic in butter and garlic. I guess I like Asian style green beans better. Service sucked. Our server was more concerned with catering to his \"older\" partrons versus being attentive to a young couple. I asked for a picture and he took it with my eyes closed and walked off!

Thank goodness our party picked this restaurant as the thought of walking in heels to another hotel was frightening. \n\nNo doubt this restaurant is consistently good with excellent service. We were a group of twelve, our table was set up in the back dining room. From the moment we sat, the service and attention we received was outstanding. What I love about this place so much no matter what city you are in, although it is a high end restaurant, the waiters are not snobby or uptight. The total opposite, they are funny, knowledgeable, and a true delight! \n\nThey were running a special for two people which was Lobster with two sides. Everyone at our table nibbled on calamari and other appetizers. I was busy socializing and drinking Honig Cabernet Sauvignon. Great little Cabernet Sauvignon for the price. I adored our waiter who realized very quickly I was enjoying the wine the most. He never ever let my glass get below half. Who really knows how many b bottle's I myself had because it was a very very long dinner. We were there over three hours. whew, yes I needed to drink. \n\nHubby realized he better get some food in me quickly. Our lobster arrived with a side of spinach and mashed potatoes. Hubby took my shell off for me so I could enjoy my lobster. I am not a huge fan of lobster, can take it or leave it but wow this was amazing. It melted in your mouth with a sweetness of pure delight. It was one of the best lobster's I ever ate. Yeah, they made me a fan of it. Everyone at our table enjoyed their entrees very much, some of the steak dishes made me a bit jealous. \n\nMy sister and her husband were dining on the other side of the restaurant and they asked their waiter to play a trick on me. It was comical and he did a great job playing along because again these waiter's are a blast. \n\nFrom the moment we arrived and had a few drinks at the bar with friendly bartender's, the food was awesome, service impeccable, this is a must visit if looking for a great quality restaurant. At least you get consistent great food and service unlike a couple of other high end restaurants in Vegas that are a ripoff. \n\nMuch thanks for a great evening, you were all wonderful. Highly recommend."

There were mutliple entree options with this menu, including a steak salad with the same 10 oz. strip steak, or salmon. Coupled with the chewy fresh pumpernickel raisin bread and sourdough, you won't leave hungry. \nService was chummy and casual, but attentive. Food came out a bit slow. The soup and au poivre sauce was salty for my taste. Classic steak house feel with the celebrity characatures on the walls gave the place old school charm.

The salad was decent but it had way too much blue cheese. And blue cheese is very strong so it was a bit overpowering. The swordfish steak was solid. It was definitely fresh, but it was nothing special. It is not served with any sides so I ordered wild mushrooms as a side dish. I did not like these one bit...what a waste of 8 bux! \n\nOverall, my meal was just okay. I do not plan on returning to the Palm Restaurant. I think it is overpriced for the quality of cuisine."

Now the whole week is but a blur of heavy eating because Diane and I had to compress it into half a week before leaving Vegas for California.  So, we packed 6 RW meals into 5 days, and I'm now happy it is over, and the extra pounds are just starting to come off.  It was good that I took notes during the many fine meals we consumed while the fun lasted.\n\nI began with excellent sweet complimentary bread that was reported to contain chocolate, and Grissini Real Torino Italian bread sticks dipped in butter.  This was followed by a very tasty Classic Caesar Salad with Garlic Croutons, Parmigiano Reggiano, and an anchovy on request.  \n\nA delicious Single Cut 9 oz. Filet Mignon made of high-quality meat prepared medium rare as ordered came next, accompanied by excellent creamy Goat Cheese Whipped Potatoes, a Wild Mushroom & Black Truffle Demi-Glace, Bearnaise, and Brandy Peppercorn Sauce that looked like oatmeal but tasted like peppery brandy as expected.  When in the mood for variety, I do not scrimp on sauces, whether to adorn bites of steak or pan-fried potstickers.\n\nWhile Diane enjoyed Lobster Bisque, Filet, and a dense Flourless Chocolate Cake with Creme Anglaise and Whipped Cream, I was pleased with my slice of Key Lime Pie with Blueberry Compote and Whipped Cream topped by a Cinnamon Stick that I initially tried to eat before I thought better of it, and saved my front teeth from imminent ruin.  \n\nWe secured the table of our choice: a large round one just inside the restaurant, and service was stellar for the entire duration of our unrushed stay.  Never once did I have to request an Iced Tea refill.  Our server forgot to charge for extra sauces, but the omission was pointed out and quickly remedied.  At $1.50 a pop for two extra sauces in large containers, with no charge for the Demi-Glace, this was quite a bargain.   \n\nAnd, it was quite a meal.  I will continue to return--during Restaurant Week or not!"

I mean every dish is intricate, flavorful, and robust. Their slider selection alone will keep you content for the rest of the evening. These aren't sliders, they're more like half-burgers, half-sandwiches. Seriously a big bang for your buck. You can't ever go wrong with fried calamari. And the fresh Oysters taste like the Gulf of Mexico minus the oil spill. \n\nWhen I think of happy hour, I think siesta, people off work, relaxing, drinking, loving life. But the Palm really doesn't qualify as a Happy Hour kind of place. It's more touristy, hit and miss crowd because when it comes  to gambling, you either win big or you're down and out.  In our case, you have more down and out crowd with elevator music. And so it is, 4 stars."

(def didn't bother me)  and I went along and dipped my bread in the sauce (yummmmmmmmay)\n\nI stuck to the good old 3 lb. lobster.  and we ordered asparagus for the side.  The girl who helped de claw the lobster also pulled the tail out so I had nothing to do, which was excellent bc i was NOT dressed to be pulling out no lobster tail.\n\nHe ordered the rib eye medium w/ a baked potato.

Really didn't expect that. \n\nPlease take note that if you are trying to find this inside Ceasar's Palace, that the walk to the shops and restaurants is filled with the stench of cigarette smoke from the decades of smoking at the Ceasar's casino. \n\nI did not ding the Palm for that, but I wanted to lt you be aware of that."

            "review": "To celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary we chose the Palm.  In the past the dinners have been exceptional  but not this time:It was a quiet night and we chose to be seated near the back where only one other table was occupied.  The waiter arrived took our drink and food order and disappeared.  But only disappeared from our table since he was more interested in the 10 top near by.  Our food was delivered by the back waiter and the head waiter never came back to check to see if we were happy with our meal.  If he had, we could have told him that my husband's MedWell bone in ribeye was under cooked on one side and over cooked on the other end.  I could have shared with him that the 6 lb lobster I ordered was still RAW in two areas.  We tried to get his attention to no avail.\n\nSince my husband knows I hate to make a scene and since it was our anniversary he didn't want to spoil it any further.  We did see the waiter for the second time when he dropped the bill at our table.  We put the $450 cash in the folder and proceeded to leave.  His tip was the balance from $432...more than he deserved.  But he had the nerve to say, \"That's what you are leaving me old man?\"  My husband who works in the industry said he should think about his service.  We are excellent tippers 25- 40% and the could confirm that with Brian or Carlos.  This waiter ruined our 25th wedding anniversary dinner, embarrassed my husband, and my son was furious.\n\nAs we exited my son asked us to step out as we spoke with McKenzie.  He heard, \" I'm sorry.\"  \n\nWhen we returned home my husband called the restaurant and spoke at length with McKenzie.   McKenzie took down the information and promised us the F&B manager would call us the next day.\n\nGuess what that call should have been received on April 16 and on April 29, 2014 and no phone call.   I can't tell you how disappointed we are.  We will only have one 25th wedding anniversary dinner and it was ruined by your staff and management.  I can't imagine why your management staff did not address the situation.I then wrote a detailed email to the corporate office and no response to date on June 10.  I called them and they said they never receive it even though I confirmed the email address.  I guess Palm Las Vegas has learned its lack of customer service from corporate.\n\nWhile I'm sure there is nothing you can do at this late date, I wanted you to know of the failings of this restaurant .  Certainly not the quality of service I would expect from The Palm."

We sat out on the patio (which I highly suggest), because it makes for great people watching in a place that is known for attracting nearly all walks of life. \n\nThe service at Palm Restaurant was excellent. We had an older either Russian or Italian server, and unlike a lot of other fine-ish dining resturants where a bus boys ends up being the one serving the table, he was very attentive the entire time and knew the menu like the back of his hand. \n\nI was with three friends and we ordered three salads and split the three-pound lobster. The salads were pretty average (I mean really, how can you get that crafty with a salad) and the lobster was just ok too, however it did feed all of us comfortably. \n\nHaving been spoiled with some really fresh seafood in my lifetime, I will say this lobster wasn't the freshest thing I've ever tasted. While it did taste good, it was lacking that just-out-of-the-ocean taste that food at some other seafood restaurants has.\n\nOverall, the Palm serves average food with great service at a high price point. With the competition for dining in Vegas, it's like Yelp says, A-OK."

He gives the best recommendations and knows how to take care of you! A table of six and we all got the Chilean Sea bass and ate every bite!! I tried it grilled, blackened, and france (no idea how to spell that). Blackened (with Cajun herbs) was my favorite! It's super light and flavorful! If you want something rich and creamy then get the France (breaded in flour and egg was with a white wine and lemon sauce). We also had the Caesar salad courtesy of our waiter and it was the best Caesar I have ever had! As for sides- get the potatoes au gratin and creamed spinach. The mushrooms are good too, but if I had to pick the creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin are the best!!!\n\nThanks for an amazing dinner and time! \n-the Pakravans"

            "review": "I wasn't too excited when I sat down to look at the menu at the Palm - being vegetarian, there wasn't a whole lot to choose from (this is a steakhouse). But I found a tomato mozarella salad that was large enough to be an entree when combined with some vegetarian side dishes that my family ordered to go along with their meaty entrees. Everything was seriously delicious - I particularly loved the wild mushroom side dish. The mozzarella in my salad was soft and moist and they brought me olive oil and balsamic vinegar so I could dress the salad to my liking. The entrees arrived just as my sister's 7-month-old got fussy, and she had to leave the table for a few minutes to walk the baby around. While she was gone, the waiter took her entree back to keep it warm, and as soon as she returned to the table he brought her dish right out to her without us even having to ask.\n\nOur server asked if we'd ever dined at the Palm before, and we hadn't. So, he comped our desserts. It was a really nice touch that I have never experienced at a restaurant before. This guy was a consummate professional, a career steakhouse waiter who has worked at five different Palm locations in the US and Mexico, we found out. He made the experience super pleasant for us. \n\nThe decor is pretty traditional steakhouse, with personality added in the form of celebrity caricatures on all the walls. My feet were killing me the night I dined here, so I wore sneakers, and didn't feel like I was getting nasty looks from the staff for doing so - a big plus for me - if I can't wear sneakers somewhere, I'd rather not go.\n\nDo go to the Palm Restaurant if you're in Vegas. You'll enjoy awesome food as well as awesome service."

After I asked if we could wait for a better table he told us no than offered us a table that everyone was crowding around trying to talk to the hostess. Clearly they didn't want us to dine here, overall I just think they treat customers poorly at this location. If my client had not requested this restaurant I would of never came back.

At 10pm I would expect to be seated where they would get us in and out as quickly as possible. As we started receiving our apps, the entire dining room had cleared out and she continued to give us THE BEST service! We were hurrying to eat and get out so they could close but she insisted that we enjoy ourselves and not to rush. Our drinks were far from weak, our shrimp & ahi apps, lobster bisque , wedge salad, and steaks were perfection. And to top it off I was a little cold and Anna noticed and brought me a warm towel for my hands and linen to wrap around me. I mean service doesn't get any better than this!!!

The server took it upon himself to start explaining everything from one end to other without taking a breath. Not a great way to start off. When he finally left, we looked at each other with eyebrows raised.  After we had a chance to look over the menu, he came back and before we even ordered, again asked us if we wanted to join and repeated the 'benefits'. Commission, no? Simply put, it got annoying. \n\nAnyways, on to the menu. We decided to share an appetizer of three jumbo shrimp sauteed in dijon sauce. It was good, but could have been presented better on a small platter, not a large flat dish with literally three split shrimp rolling around. lol\n\nThe side of wild mushrooms was sauteed and delicious. The string beans had the option of sauteed in garlic or steamed; we got it steamed and we agreed they were a bit tough and possibly undercooked. \n\nOk, the filet mignon 9 oz. medium rare - sooo good. Cooked to perfection. The salmon was HUGE....neither of us could finish it. May have something to do with the taste, too - even though it was topped with butter, the fish itself was a little \"bland,\" as my friend stated (his words, not mine!). \n\nAfter our plates were cleared and as I was leaning forward saying something, our server inserted a small-desk-sized platter of six desserts on the table and asked us which one we wanted. I remember a feeling of wow, a bit rude and I just lost my train of thought. Plus, he didn't even ask if we had room for dessert. Well, we didn't. \n\nNow I come on to yelp and find out they had restaurant week this whole time. The server didn't even mention this, even though my dish was on the special menu. Grrrr...."

I've eaten here in the past but haven't been here for a few years...\n\nthe steaks are always great.  the only issue i had was i ordered med-rare, and it was more medium...\n\nbut the salads, the sides (we split a half/half, i guess that makes it a half half half half)  were very good also.\n\nthis is one of the many great food locales that are available in las vegas.  its on the list for a return visit."

            "review": "The management and the kitchen should be ashamed.  My husband and I are locals, and professionals in the restaurant industry in Las Vegas.  We stopped by to have nice lunch on a weekday.  I ordered my steak to be prepared \"rare.\"  It came out medium-rare, bordering on medium.  The server asked how everything was, politely apologized, and replaced the steak.\n\nThe next steak the kitchen sent out was RAW.  Cold from the cooler, slapped on the grill for seconds to vaguely impart grill marks, raw red meat with cold white fat.  There is a difference between rare and raw.  The server apologized and repeatedly offered to bring me another entree, but after the clear message I received from the kitchen, I did not trust the cooks or the chef that allowed that to be served to a guest.  I ate nothing.  \n\nThe server was attentive and concerned checking back with us a few times;  however, the manager, Diego Montemayor, did not approach our table until the after my husband had finished his meal, and our table had been cleared.  He did not ask about the situation, and only said \"Hey sorry about the hiccup with the steak- we'll take it off your bill.\"  When we paid our bill and left the restaurant- the manager did not acknowledge us, and avoided eye contact.   \n\nMaybe Palm restaurant has lowered their standards.  We were looking forward to a nice meal that we have come to expect from the Palm, as I've eaten at the Chicago location several times.  It is extremely disappointing that the chef would allow the cooks to send out such a clear \"f u\" to guests and the management would not properly address the situation.  They are obviously not concerned with upholding their reputation or keeping a local clientele."

We had a party of 5 and we all ordered different things, so we had a good variety to taste some of their dishes. \n\nFor the atmosphere, I did not really like the 1/3 of the restaurant butting out the front entrance in the mall walkway. It just feels like your eating in a mall with just a table and chairs with people walking back and forth staring at you and your food. Luckily, we were seated like half and half from the outside and inside. I sat down at an angle where I can see a little interior and the forum shops. I kept staring at Burberry. \n\nFor the food, I tried the watermelon salad with the cheese in the middle of the watermelon. It was different, pretty good and I'd say worth the try. Nothing superiorly amazing that'll make me come back for though. Lobster bisque was okay, a bit towards the saltier side and not as creamy as expected. There was this shrimp dish, forgot the name, but it had Dijon mustard as part of the sauce and it was pretty good. For my entree, I had the double cut lamb chop 18oz. We also ordered sides: the asparagus fritti, goat cheese mashed potatoes, three cheese potato something, and wild mushrooms. I really enjoyed the potatoes. Cheese and potatoes? Hell yeah. Goat cheese mashed potato was different, I'd probably get that again if I came back. Asparagus fritti, no big deal. Just deep fried asparagus but the sauce with it is not bad. Wild mushrooms are no big deal. As for my lamb, it was juicy, fat, and pretty good. \n\nMy mom got a cheesecake, whoop happy birthday mom, comped by the restaurant, and it was like your typical cheesecake. Thank you though ! The staff was really friendly. I enjoyed their kindness and happy-go attitude. \n\nOh and eat the bread. That shiet was addicting."

I was in town and made online reservations a day in advance for dinner for a party of five on a Saturday evening @ 6:30pm. We arrived a few minutes early and were seated almost immediately. The table we were seated at was located just inside of the outdoor seating area, which was great, because we could enjoy the pulse of activity going on outside in the forum shops area right in front of us. Our male server was polite and for the most part attentive, but we had to remind him for an item he initially forgot and we had to ask for water refills. \n\nDecent menu selection, but very pricey! The food we ordered was okay...but was nothing special (which included orders of the NY Strip Steak & Filet Mignon). I don't mind paying high prices as long as it's worth it...but in this instance I didn't feel the food quality matched the prices being charged. Which is the same with how we felt about the service. My wife and I felt that we've had a better overall dining experience at Flemings and they aren't even as expensive. Interesting note: I initially tried to get reservations at Flemings, but it was booked solid whereas at this restaurant it was definitely not packed. \n\nOverall, I would have to say nice ambiance, neat location being located in the Caesar's Forum Shops...but in my opinion the food and service fell short of the $$$ paid."

Since we were heading in the Caesar's Palace direction anyway, figured we should try something besides Spago out.\n\nIt oozed quality the minute you got in and were met by the ma\u00ee\u00b7tre d'h\u00f4\u00b7tel and checked our coats in. It wasn't busy when we arrived and they found us a table straight away. Nicely furnished and relaxing atmosphere. Interesting walls, where they have picture/cartoon paintings of all the famous people who have eaten in the restaurant. \n\nThe waiter brought us over the beers we had asked for and the menus. Food on the menu is pricey, so much so that I was scared to look at what the beer was costing. We decided to start with a Caesar Salad with a vinaigrette sauce and, much as I don't do rabbit food, I almost ate all of it by myself!\n\nWe both went for the 14oz Filet Mignon with the lobster add-on, with all the side dishes (mashed potatoes and creamed spinach) we wanted. What I didn't expect them to do was bring the love lobster out to us to see what the before and after would look like! We thought it was funny that they let us hold it up to take pictures of. \n\nAnyway, the steak and lobster were cooked exactly the way I wanted. The sauce and the side dishes were excellent too.\n\nWe were offered dessert, when they brought over a big tray showing what was available, but neither of us were up for eating any more. my mate though asked for one of the huge portions of carrot cake to be put in a takeaway box to take home for his wife.\n\nSo the downside is that it's not cheap! (But what good restaurant in Vegas is?) If you can afford it, the Palms is a great place to go. Most satisfying meal I've had in ages!"

It was rich and creamy lobster salad on a kaiser roll...very good.  They must be known for their lobster, because there were several people eating that.  Our entrees were about $20 each.  \n\nThey have a good wine list.  We had a bottle of Hartford Ct Chardonnay for $97.  Rodney Strong Chardonnay was $14 for a small pour, $20 for a large pour.  \n\nWe also had an amazing server (David W).  He was very personable and fun.  We took a few more breaks at the bar in between shopping, and I have to say the bartenders and servers were all very attentive and great at what they do.  Nice atmosphere - we sat on the \"patio\" which is outside of the restaurant, but inside The Forum, so opportunity for people watching.  The bar area was fun with the caricatures all over the wall, and there are TVs if you're a sports fan."

We were all going to order individual appetizers but our waiter suggested we get three of the triple appetizer towers.  That was a great choice, plenty of variety for all of us.  I even think we ordered a fourth.  All of us ordered some sort of steak or chop, all of which were cooked to perfection for every order.  I myself had the Rib-eye, fabulous as always.  This is the only steak i will ever order at the Palm. No other steakhouse can compare.  There was not one complaint about anyone's food.  Everyone was served basically at the same time, no one had to wait.  The food was without a doubt outstanding, and the service by our waiter Israel \"Izzy\" Ruelas and his serving assistants was exceptional beyond belief.  They truly made our dinning experience for my son's\"s bachelor party a memorable one that will not be forgotten. As an 837 club member from the original in New York this was outstanding.  You can take all of your celebrity TV chefs and put them aside.  They are not even in the same category with food or service that was experienced from our visit to The Palm. Again BRAVO Palm and Thank You Again. You rock Izzy"

For entree i had the 14oz filet. I was somewhat let down by the filet as i was expecting the same great experience ive had at the LA Palms. The filet was a little tough and there were some gristle lines throughout..... i think i just had a bad cut. Shit happens sometimes, but it was still decent.

The service was very good - the waiter was nice and helpful, he cut up our steak in two and brought it on separate plates (since we were splitting).  We ordered only one glass of wine, trying to keep the price down, but it was brought out in a little decanter and was enough for two full glasses - it worked out great!  The only thing - our steak was a bit overcooked (16oz sirloin at $40), but that maybe because they misunderstood our desire for medium as a medium well....  The clams oregano were a bit too oily and bread crumby.  In general, it was a good experience with large portions. (Price: $100 approx for one glass of wine, appetizer, $40 steak entree, 2 sides)"

The sides come extra, and are more than big enough for two people to share.  They don't mark up their wine as much as most places do---which is a good thing.  For Las Vegas, though, their wine selection leaves a bit to be desired.\n\nWhat causes me such consternation about the Palm is the disparity between the food/prices and the attitude/service.   They have great food, fantastic food actually, and you pay relatively fair prices for it.  In fact, the steak I had there is one of the best I've ever had.  Unfortunately, it was matched with equally terrible service.  They are slow, they are rude, they are arrogant, they are pushy, and no matter how many times we asked for water, asked for more wine, asked for butter for the bread, or asked the server not to do something he didn't listen!  I wish we'd listened when, while waiting to be seated, a woman walked out of the back dining room and announced to the entire restaurant that they should leave while they still could to avoid a terrible experience.\n\nFor an 8-top, purchasing multiple bottles of wine, and nearly everything on the menu (total bill over $2,000) you'd think you could get better service.  Thankfully, I wasn't paying.  If I was, I'd never go back here again."
